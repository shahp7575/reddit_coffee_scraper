1qn8ddx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1qn8ddx/beginner_runner_looking_for_advice/,"Beginner Runner, looking for advice","A bit of context first, I (25M) have been working out and following a proper diet for a year to lose fat. I have lost around 20kgs of weight (currently 75kgs), I would just walk 1.5 hours daily. Few months back, I started running on treadmill and it was much easier than before and I felt good. So I have been running on treadmill once or twice a week, and I stopped after I could easily do it for 1 hour at 8 kmph speed, as people also want to use those machines and started giving stares. So I have started running on road for a week and have bunch of questions about it.

Here's my 3 runs for the week:

1. Wednesday - 5.33 Km - 43:49
2. Friday - 7.08 Km - 1:04:38
3. Monday - 10.2 Km - 1:23:58

First, I wanted to ask if I do these 3 runs every week, would I be able to build enough strength and endurance to do HM and FM? For now, I am just focusing on increasing distance and not speed. But would short durations of sprint help me or I can risk injury? I already feel slight discomfort on my knees (very slight!).

How do I prepare for my morning runs? like should I eat at night before bed or 30 minutes before run. Since im also in calorie deficit, I dont want to eat too high calorie foods, I just want something that can give me enery quick enough for the run. For now, Im just taking protein shake with oats and coffee. But I think it just takes time to digest and I dont feel the energy during the run.

Since I train 6 days a week, PPL routine in evening, how do I structure my runs, so im giving my legs enough rest and not overtrain them. Also some excercises and routines so I dont injure my shin or calves.

Lastly, any tips on how to control breathing, in my previous runs, I just try to keep my mouth shut to not breathe from mouth. but my breathing is irregular and I feel that costs me some more kms.

I understand that I could have asked Chatgpt, but I wanted a human response, to learn from someone who has climbed the same steps as me. Any other advice would be much appreciated, Thanks!",1,1769408792.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

1qn8c3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qn8c3b/youre_lowkey_attractive_the_world_already_sees_it/,You’re low-key attractive — the world already sees it (you just don’t,"Most people walking around believe they’re “average” at best. Meanwhile, everyone around them is secretly thinking they’re cute, interesting, or magnetic in a way they don’t even realize. If this sounds like you, you’re not alone. We live in a world where beauty is filtered, facial symmetry is algorithmically rated, and charisma is treated like an innate gift. But tons of people are “low-key attractive” — they just haven’t learned how to see it or show it.



This post is for the folks who feel invisible, but are actually radiating more than they know. It’s pulled from solid research, top-tier books, psychology insights, and real-world data — not viral TikTok advice from influencers with ring lights and zero credentials.



Here’s how to uncover and amplify your underrated hotness (yes, it’s real):



 People drastically underestimate how attractive they appear to others. A study from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Epley & Whitchurch, 2008) found that people rate themselves as less attractive than others do. Your brain literally filters your own image through a harsher lens. So stop treating your mirror as the truth.



\- Facial expressions matter more than bone [structure.In](http://structure.In) Survival of the Prettiest\*, psychologist Nancy Etcoff explains that expressiveness, warmth, and subtle confidence affect perceived attractiveness way more than static features do. You think it’s your nose. It’s your vibe.



\- Being perceived as attractive is 50% about presence. According to Psychology Today, studies prove that traits like posture, vocal tonality, and eye contact massively boost how others rate your looks. People are wired to pick up on subtle cues of self-trust and poise. That’s what makes “average” people look stunning in real life.



\- Attractiveness = familiarity + softness. That’s why people look better over time, in person, or in comfy settings. Research from Zaidel (UCLA, 2013) shows that familiarity increases perceived attractiveness. You don’t need to be a model. You just need to be seen consistently.



\- The “mere exposure effect” works in your favor.If you’ve ever thought someone got hotter the more you saw them, it wasn’t in your head. It’s a documented psychological phenomenon. Your classmates, coworkers, or gym friends probably think you’re 2x hotter than you think you are.



\- Grooming basics change everything. Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy emphasizes how “power posing” and self-care routines give off confidence signals that others read as attractiveness. Clean nails, good skin, solid posture, and smelling nice carry more weight than your jawline ever will.



\- Attractiveness isn’t about fitting a mold. It’s about congruence. In The Art of Charm podcast, dating coach Jordan Harbinger breaks down how people rate others as attractive when their style, body language, and energy align. You might not be a 10 conventionally, but when you own your style, you glow differently.



\- Most people are too insecure to compliment you. Just because they don’t say it doesn’t mean they’re not thinking it. According to research in the \*British Journal of Social Psychology, people often withhold compliments out of fear they’ll come off weird. You were never invisible — they just stayed quiet.



You’re not just okay.” You’re not “mid.” You’re not “background.” You’re probably a silent crush, a late-night thought, or someone’s favorite regular at the coffee shop. You just haven’t realized it yet.

Blue(him)

My boyfriend(26M) and I(24F) have been dating for almost a year now. He plays a lot of video games and this girl found him on a mutual server and added him. When she first messaged him with “hey I love your name, super adorable. Let’s play arc sometime?” He showed me that message and asked if he could play with her. I was iffy because the message seemed a little flirty but we agreed as long as he doesn’t play alone with her or late at night. He agreed. 

Fast forward to the next day. I started my time of the month which is honestly pretty painful for me but I’m ok.(this is apparently important for “his side”) we went out and got coffee, got home and a few hours later I received a DM on steam asking for my discord from some girl, I accepted and she sent me screenshots of their conversation which honestly made me feel sick. We had a whole fight due to it, he really thinks he didn’t do anything wrong.

My problem is that she sent him an inappropriate picture and made a comment that he can see he private parts, kept trying to video call and said that he could put a baby in her. Not once did he shut her down and he didn’t block her and still wanted to play video games with her. He says “I was going to show you but you were having a bad day” if so why was he trying to delete the messages when she sent them? He was trying to delete them so I wouldn’t see so he could still play video games with her. I asked “why would you be willing to still play video games with her after how disrespectful she was being to me?” His response was “I wanted to mainly see if she was good at the game or if she was a bot” I said “why does that even matter!? The fact that you were still messaging her and wanted to play games after she sent you what she did, that’s the problem. You were still trying to technically have a relationship with someone like that which put you in a bad situation making you more likely to cheat and completely being disrespectful and lying to me.” 

He also said “I don’t avoid situations like that because I know I’m loyal and can show my restraint.” Like wtf??? So now I really feel like he will cheat on me, purposely putting yourself in bad situations and not shutting them down to “show your restraint”?

He said he told his friends and they think I’m overreacting but he left out the part that he was trying to delete the messages so I wouldn’t see so he could still play with he and I wouldn’t be upset. Am I overreacting and what would you call this??",2,1769408518.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Were you in a relationship with Dr. Marquez?


What this brings to Tom's mind is Alejandro's broken voice that night. The tears he tried to hide. The disappointment in his eyes. With the aroma of coffee in the background.


—Well, yes...

He is interrupted.


—Relax, I'm not jealous. Just curious.—He smiles mischievously—Although there's something else I'm curious about.


—Oh yeah?— He smiles back.

—Well, you're a cop. Control is part of you. But tell me, do you like keeping it even behind closed doors?— He barely raises his eyebrows with that smile he's had all day.


—Um, well... I'm versatile. I adapt to the other person's enjoyment.

Even though he keeps that flirty smile, it feels like a betrayal. A betrayal of the heart. One that, no matter how hard he tries to forget, doesn't understand trying. It brings back the images of that night. Their first kiss. The clothes scattered along the path. The marks from the other day. The raw emotions.


—Would you like...

Tom interrupts him.

—I, I'm sorry. I can't handle this.

—Why? Did I do something you didn't like?


—No—He looks at the ground— You're a good guy, but...

—But I'm not him—He interrupts and looks at him with a sympathetic smile.

—I...

—It's okay, I understand. I know what it's like to be this crazy about someone. It shows in your eyes, Tom.


—I know I should forget about it, but I can't.


Lucas puts a hand on Tom's shoulder.


—Yeah, I understand. It's not easy.


—Thanks.

Ring, ring...

1qn85pj,https://i.redd.it/zhtmo4tkymfg1.gif,Update: I turned my local AI Agent Orchestrator into a Mobile Command Center (v0.5.0). Now installable via npx.,"A few days ago, I shared **Formic**—my local-first tool to orchestrate Claude Code/Copilot agents so I could stop copy-pasting code.

The feedback was great, but the setup (cloning repos, configuring Docker volumes manually) was high friction.

**So I shipped v0.5.0.**

You can now launch the entire ""Command Center"" in your current project with a single command: `npx formic@latest start`

**New Features in v0.5.0:**

📱 **Mobile Tactical View (See GIF)** I realized I wanted to monitor my agents while making coffee or sitting on the couch.

* Formic now detects mobile browsers (PWA) and switches to a high-contrast ""Tactical View.""
* Combined with Tailscale, I can dispatch tasks and watch the terminal stream live from my phone, securely.

🔀 **Multi-Workspace Support** Real apps aren't single repos. I often have a backend service and a frontend app open simultaneously.

* You can now map multiple projects into Formic.
* Switch contexts instantly: Queue a database migration in the `backend` workspace, then switch to `frontend` to queue the UI updates. The agents run in parallel scopes.

**The Stack:**

* **Install:** NPM / NPX
* **Runtime:** Node.js 20
* **State:** Local JSON (in your project folder)
* **Orchestration:** Fastify + Docker (Automated via the CLI)

**The ""Self-Building"" Update:** True to the philosophy, I used Formic v0.3 to build the CLI installer and the Mobile PWA logic for v0.5.

**Try it (Requires Docker running):**

Bash

    npx formic@latest start
    

**Full Release Notes:**[https://github.com/rickywo/Formic/releases/tag/v0.5.0](https://github.com/rickywo/Formic/releases/tag/v0.5.0)**Repo:**[https://github.com/rickywo/Formic](https://github.com/rickywo/Formic)

**My (20M) girlfriend (21F) has stopped sexual intimacy. She’s bringing up the idea of soon cutting off every form of intimacy. Am I overthinking by thinking I can’t do anything about it?**



I want to start off by saying that I know that I’m on an old NSFW account and that we’re a very young couple so it might not be taken as “seriously” as other relationships. We’ve recently hit 8 months together and she’s the woman of my dreams but I’ve been so afraid recently. I don’t really have anyone to talk about it in life as friends/trusted people have been getting busy with their own lives so it might be a long read but TL;DR at end and I apologize for formatting (obviously on mobile).

I met this girl a while back in high school and we’ve been friends since then but life happens and we kinda grew apart but fate brought us back together and now we’re in a relationship. I’ve never been so happy with another person before and she’s changed my life for the better but recently I’ve been feeling a bit down recently.

A lot of backstory from my personal experience but this is what matters. My first girlfriend was a mixed experience and it ended very ugly. I’m cutting off a lot of details since I’d rather not talk about her but long story short, she cheated on me after (or maybe before? i don’t really want to find out) forcing me to have sex. I never told anyone about this until I met my girlfriend and made me understand that I was raped.

My girlfriend helped me figure things out and be more open about intimacy and she helped me out so much. I’ve been really respectful about her boundaries and I ALWAYS ask for consent before anything physical happens. She has told me before that I wouldn’t have to ask since I ask every time before sex, but I personally can’t and won’t do that as I’ll always ask for her consent. We’ve been very sexually active and it made me more confident with myself but that changed around 2 months ago.

One day she just stopped being in the mood. I didn’t hold anything against her since it’s her body and she has every right to say no. I hadn’t asked for intimacy when I noticed she wasn’t in the mood anymore and I don’t mean to say anything negative about her at all, but I was at my “peak” so to speak in terms of being sexually active and getting rid of it very suddenly made me lose a lot of confidence. I do love her and all and after talking about it, she said she’s going to save it for marriage from that point on.

I accepted it and I feel like I’ve been doing just a bit better but still feel sexually frustrated. That doesn’t mean I’m not happy with her as I just adore every single little thing about her and I love spending time with her. It was hard at first getting rid of a habit since intimacy was like a big part of our relationship, but that doesn’t mean it was the one thing holding us together. I’ve been trying to find ways to “suppress” that feeling through working out or going back to old hobbies, but working out usually intensifies my desire for intimacy (which sucks as I’m trying to gain more confidence) and the feeling still lingers. I don’t want her for her body, but I just miss that intimacy so much.

About a week or two ago, she said that she might soon stop every form of intimacy like kissing, cuddling, holding hands, etc. I didn’t show it to her but it broke me so bad. I remember going home and admittedly, I cried myself to sleep and my mood was off for a few days. My mood is now somewhat decent but I feel a bit emotional as I’m typing this. I love this woman for who she is and how she’s been with me through everything, but I don’t see myself lasting without ANY form of intimacy until marriage. We’re very young and the thought of waiting years before having any form of physical contact has been eating me alive for the past week or so.

She does love me very much but I’ve been so confused. Why be so intimate if it’s supposed to be for marriage only? Again, I ADORE this woman with everything but I’ve been so hesitant to admit that I don’t see it working if there’s no form of intimacy for the next few years. I don’t feel trapped in our relationship but I feel so bad if I left. She’s helped me through the worst of times and made me into a better person of pursuing my dreams and goals. I’ve always been there for her when no one was there to support her and helped her through the hardest times of her life both current and past.

I feel like I’m heavily overthinking too much about this. I love her so much but why am I having doubts about our future? If I were to leave, would she think I only wanted her for her body? Can I really hide my desire for intimacy for so long? Will our relationship last longer? So many more questions that overwhelm me both emotionally and physically. I’ve been so clingy with her recently, always cuddling with her, kissing her, holding her, taking naps with her, but I’m afraid that I’m only rushing the process of getting rid of all that. She’s told me so many times that it’s not because of me, but it’s just something that’s reserved for marriage.

I’m at such a huge low point right now. I love her so much and don’t want to let go but at the same time, everything that “brought” us closer together is fading. Is it okay to overthink so much about this? How much longer can I go without no form of intimacy between us? I love her very much but I’m afraid that she’ll think I only wanted her for her body if I do break things off. Any advice?

TL;DR: Girlfriend cut off sexual intimacy as it’s only meant for marriage in her eyes. Now she’s cutting off ANY form of intimacy soon, same reasoning. I’ve been so conflicted and distraught recently and trying to find ways to save our relationship.

*She’s waaaaay too young to pull this card. After having a health, adult, intimate relationship and just put of the blue nailing up stop signs all over the house, I’d wonder really hard about there being someone else. She lets you look through her phone? Why would want to go through it? That screams of insecurity and a tad controlling and if you do a lot of self reflecting you might see this. This also may be part of the halt in the intimacy. You want to counter everything that anyone says regarding why she might be doing this, but why? The level of the intensity in your relationship is kind of scary. I’m not saying anything bad about either of you, but this is not healthy at all. What if she breaks up with you? How would you handle this. With what you say it sounds like you wouldn’t or couldn’t accept this. If she is committed to staying with you I think you both need counseling. It says more about you if you do, truly.*

>OOP: Again I misworded things but I don’t ask to go through her phone. She says I’m open to see it whenever I want to and I’ve only done it once recently to see if there was really someone else but didn’t find anything at all. Being honest with you, I didn’t realize im countering what anyone says. I think I’m just in denial about our relationship ending and maybe I’m just trying to defend her? I do care about her so much and she’s helped me become a better person but I don’t want it to end.

**Antique-Ambition9978**

*I get it, I do. But I think I’m right in saying you are grasping at straws here to hold onto something unhealthy. Whether she’s cheating or not, something’s going on and withholding any and all intimacy from you is not normal. I think it’s time to get out before you’re in so deep you become a crazed stalker when it ends. Trust me, if she is cheating, telling you to look through her phone says she’s not keeping anything incriminating on it.*

>OOP: Again, being honest with you, I am grasping at straws. I know I have an out of this relationship ever since she stopped intimacy but I really don’t know why I still want to be with her. Again, I don’t think she is cheating but who knows. Do you think trying to ask why every form of intimacy is going to stop again is a good idea or would it just create more problems?

**Antique-Ambition9978**

*Hell no, ask her. Having a really frank discussion is what you need, no condemnations, no anger, nothing. No matter what either of you say, just be honest. You can’t make her be honest, but you should. It’s just not normal. I’d feel different if you were both in a religious sect and were brought up to feel this way, but you didn’t say anything about that, so I’m guessing no. You are still so damn young and I promise you, you will find someone who will share your values, wants and needs. Thank her for everything she did for you and take those lessons with you when you walk out the door. You might get some head games from her when you do, but you have to be true to yourself. Trust me, this will become a bigger issue and you will end up resenting her for it. Why go through all that, when you’re clearly not happy now. I just had to watch my 32 yr. old son get his world rocked last year and it sucked. He was with his wife for nine years, married for two years and 3 weeks. He came home from his late hockey game and she said, I’m done, I’m tapping out. BOOM, his world was shattered, she had the papers the next week and they were divorced 4 months later. Now she says she’s made a mistake. Oops, that’s not a mistake, that’s a major fucking issue. Don’t end up with your world shattered like his was, just sayin…..*

>OOP: Thank you man. From what I understand she’s a bit religious and that’s why I understand the sexual intimacy being for marriage, just the no intimacy at all is very confusing. I used to be religious but I had a really bad experience at church that made me lose faith in God and I began to have doubts. You’re right that I should have a talk ASAP, I mean I’m kind of a mess already at the moment and reading your comment just made me think of how much “worse” it’ll be if I let it drag on. I don’t want to resent her at all, she’s been a huge help with getting my shit together in life up until recently.

**Antique-Ambition9978**

*Okay, first off, you’re getting a woman’s prospective from me, so no one can say it was a “guy” thing. I have just never tolerate either sex doing something harmful in a relationship to their partners. If that’s what she wants then she should not be in a relationship at all, or find someone with those core values to date. It does NOT make you a bad person for not being able to handle this sudden switch. Look, guys like sex, women like sex, and she went from all out to full stop. There is a reasons for this, your just not getting the real one.*

>OOP: I didn’t mean any offense so my bad. Going back to it though, I feel like I’m gonna have a talk with her and might end things with her. Maybe I just have “trauma” but I’m afraid of being seen as a bad person as to why we broke up.



**Update - 7 days later**



It’s been a rough week. Thank you to everyone who helped me figure things out and finally stand up. She’s handling it way better than I am which I’m thankful for. Anyways back to the main thing.

We met up at a Starbucks nearby, got our coffee and sat in the car. I told her I wanted to talk about something that’s been on my mind for a while and I think she knew what I was going to say. I held her hand the whole time and told her I wasn’t mad or upset at her, but there’s been some things lingering on my mind.

First off, with the no sexual intimacy part of the story. There was no cheating at all involved and if I’m going to be honest with you guys, having that thought mentioned destroyed me mentally and I hate that it was brought up in the first place. Again, someone on my last post was right and it was a religious decision, although not by her. Her parents found out that we were being intimate quite often and according to her, they threatened to tell the church and have them intervene.

Before I start, I’m not making this into a religious hate post.

I’m going to be honest, I’ve never been a big fan of church. Sure, I don’t mind religion and I don’t doubt that’s there’s some “good” churches but I feel like that’s where some of that “Christian hate” comes from. Her parents are very controlling of her when it comes to her personal life, even financially as well.

Now for the no intimacy at all, things got a bit confusing. She said she only brought it up because of a bad experience she had with an ex and thought it was normal to do in a relationship. Think of like fights when both sides want some time apart, she thought she needed to say that part. I just told her that she could’ve told me she wanted time apart instead of saying no more intimacy.

I also asked her if I messed up at any point in our relationship. She said I didn’t but there’s been a few disagreements between us but it never impacted our relationship. I asked if I was too much for her and she said only sometimes. After that she started talking a lot about her life being constantly busy and her parents never giving her freedom, school was too much, and personal life got overwhelming at times.

At that time I knew she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I let her finish talking and I told her that things weren’t working out. She cried for a while and told me not to leave her as she doesn’t have anyone else. I told her we can still talk but our relationship can’t last much longer if we keep being this way. I told her that even if we still stayed together, it would’ve ended way worse and we would go no-contact. She cried for a bit more and I held her close while trying to comfort her.

I’m really hoping she’s not holding out for hope in the future. I told her that I had no regrets at all about our relationship, I enjoyed the trips we took around the state, and that I would do it all over again. I think I fucked up by telling her that but what’s done is done.

Before she left, i let her calm down a bit and told her everything would be fine. I gave her a hug, kissed her, and we went out separate ways. Honestly, I only text her to see how she’s doing and she only texts me for any questions she didn’t have a chance to bring up but she’s been handling it way better than i am.

I’ve been feeling alone for the past week and as one commenter mentioned on my last post, I am attached to her. I’ve been doing a few things to keep my mind busy and it does help every now and then, but other than that I feel alone. My friends are out of state and for some reason, my only friend that stayed here has been avoidant? Anyways, it’s going to be rough in the near future but everything should be okay.

*Sounds like you should just be friends.*

>OOP: We decided we’re going that route, obviously not right away. We’re still working through things but we’ve always worked great as friends.

**No-Professional3800**

*Unilaterally cutting off intimacy, a VERY important part of any healthy relationship, is toxic and manipulative behavior. I’m not sure how her parents’ “church” found out you guys were being intimate, her parents sound crazy as all get out, but if she’s not willing to fight for your relationship as is and just bends to the will of her parents and then making you suffer for it, that’s not at all good for a relationship. Pretty much shows you where you stand in the relationship and how she’ll just bend to the will of her parents anytime they don’t like anything with the relationship. All in all, just wouldn’t be good to stay and you made a good decision.*

>OOP: Their church hasn’t found out, her parents just threatened to tell them if she didn’t stop. Again that’s also been an issue as well, I mean I understand up to a certain point but she does need to stand up. Her parents are crazy and always threaten to kick her out, which she doesn’t know if it’s “just a threat” or if they mean it, but it also gives her parents the idea that I’m not good for her and she did try to defend me, but it’s been far too late for that.

**ThePhoenixRisesAgain**

*What happens if they tell the church? She may just decide to not go there anymore. I mean, we live in the 21st century…*

>OOP: I think she’s just scared of the humiliation, which I don’t blame her. Sure she’s religious and stuff and I don’t mind at all, church is a “big” part of her life and switching to another one might be rough on her? That’s just my view and honestly I haven’t asked too much about that.

**ThePhoenixRisesAgain**

*She is allowed to choose between church and sex. You are allowed to choose between a sexless relationship and ending it.*

**Title:** What’s the ONE Woodworking Mistake You’ll Never Make Again?  

Hey folks — this one’s a little personal.  

I still remember that sinking feeling the first time I realized my woodworking troubles weren’t because of my tools… they were because of *me.*  

Crooked angles, joints that somehow never sat flush, oak that split right down the grain after hours of prep. I blamed the wood, the saw, even the weather — anything but my inexperience.  

One day, after ruining what should’ve been a simple coffee table, I noticed the common thread in every failed project: **rushing.**  
I wasn’t measuring right. I wasn’t letting the wood acclimate. I wasn’t *listening* to what the material was telling me.  

That moment changed every build that came after. I slowed down, planned twice, cut once. Suddenly the joints tightened up. The cuts lined up. The frustration dropped.  

If you’ve ever been there — staring at a half-finished project wondering why it just isn’t working — know this: The fundamentals really are everything.  

I came across a course that drove that lesson home hard, focused on real-world woodworking (not pro-shop setups or $3k planers). It’s packed with practical guidance I wish I’d had on day one.

Here’s what really stuck with me:  
• The best woodworkers aren’t the fastest — they’re the calmest.  
• Clean, simple joints beat complicated ones done poorly.  
• Fifteen minutes of prep saves hours of frustration later.  

It’s wild how something as small as slowing down can turn “this doesn’t fit” into “that’s a perfect snug joint.”  

If you’ve ever learned a lesson like that the hard way, I’d love to hear it.

Please tell me how bad what I did is.,"Yesterday I got into the biggest fight I’ve ever gotten into with my dad. He’s an alcoholic and was drunk during all of this. He told me I’d never amount to anything, that I should kill myself and he called me a piece of shit he even insulted my looks. I am his only daughter and the only child in college. My brother is a 31 year old bum with no job that still lives at home and he joined in on the insulting as well. Things got physical more than once, my dad threw coffee on me, spit on me and said the most painfully awful things he’s ever said to me. So I fought back physically and verbally, I hit him once or twice I think I even spit on him after he spit on me, everything happened so fast I don’t remember it all. I called him many things including a hypocrite for wanting respect from me after he talks to me the way he does. Both my brother and dad started bringing my boyfriend into the argument, even threatening to fight him and told me he is no longer welcome at my house. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years and he is my best friend, he’s the one who not only comforts me but also defends me during hard times with my family, so obviously this made me even more angry. At some points my dad would lunge at me at an attempt to hit me so I would lunge back, my cousin and mom would hold us back from each other and I directed my anger towards walls and doors instead. Thinking about it now I am ashamed, I looked at the holes I left in the wall and to be like my dad is the last thing I want. I was so incredibly angry and hurt by the way my they were treating me (most of all my dad), I didn’t back down when he disrespected me and I gave it right back to him. My hands are bruised, one of them is swollen and in pain from how hard I hit and broke the kitchen wall and it serves as a reminder that I’m my father’s daughter. It hurts so bad, not only my hand but my heart. My mom and cousin have been nothing but supportive through all of this, they have encouraged me and they remind me that I will graduate and can prevail and escape this kind of life. My mom is a house cleaner and has recently been suffering from poor health, she has a lot of body pain because of her strenuous job so she always encourages and pushes me to be better and stay studious. They told me that they’re not only proud of everything I have already accomplished but also proud I stood my ground and gave them a taste of their own medicine. My mom gets mad and argues with them but is mostly passive, I didn’t mention this before but the cause for the whole situation was my brother and dad’s addiction and alcoholism. We live in a never ending cycle of fighting then going back to normal like nothing ever happened but yesterday was different. I was so angry watching them walk all over my mom, my dad said nasty things to her and my cousin and they fight back but it’s like they’re not taken seriously. I have never been so angry, I am not a fighter. I’m 20 years old and I’ve never been in a physical fight not even a verbal one during my teenage years. I left home and came back to my college campus 3 hours away despite the crazy snow we’re experiencing. Today has been incredibly difficult as I’m stuck in my dorm alone, thinking about what happened yesterday, I didn’t have a traditional college experience, I transferred from community college and I’m studying psychology to be a therapist (lol) which is something that my dad always uses against me in arguments. I usually am able to brush it aside but my dad’s words ring in my ears and I’ve never doubted myself the way I am right now. I am so sad and so hurt and so angry at the men in my family. I just need to get this off my chest, I know I messed up but I also know I don’t deserve the things my dad and brother said to me.",2,1769407391.0,daddyissuesclub,0,1.0,False
1qn7x4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1qn7x4t/i_need_answers/,I need answers,"Met an older man in 2022 after starting a new job.. we got on great, worked together really well and had lots of banter. There was occasional flirting and stuff we probably shouldn’t have been talking about considering he was married. We got closer as time went on.. nothing physical ever happened. He would compliment me, clearly flirt or make comments etc but never made a move and had boundaries. The chemistry was undeniable. It was like nobody else existed in the room. Anyway, fast forward.. he left work last year and it really hit me. I missed him and our dynamic in work. I thought maybe this was a good thing and now I could take a step back and we would just naturally distance. But we kept messaging outside of work. Added eachother on Facebook etc.. that was my idea and kept in contact. Not overly flirtatious messages but just nice messages which indicated he clearly wanted to keep in contact. We met up around April time last year and went for a drink and he was clearly checking me out.. he even made a comment about it (I even accidentally met his wife later that night and it was awkward as hell) and then we met up around June time and went for a coffee. We continued to chat over Facebook etc. around August / September time, we were meant to meet up on two occasions which was his idea with him clearly saying ‘let me know if you go and I’ll come see you’. This was in relation to me going to a house viewing and the other time was a walk down the beach. But it started to change slightly.. I knew that it may start to distance eventually. He didn’t follow through with those meeting plans. I’m starting to think maybe his wife said something to him. I haven’t seen him in person since June 2025 BUT I made the decision to step back from it around September 2025 onwards.. and he still reaches out. I won’t initiate contact but he will check in every few weeks (about 7 weeks) and will ask how I am and my living situation etc. He messaged me last week asking me if I was in the same area as I was a few weeks ago (I told him I’d met a nice guy there last time). He questioned me about this a few weeks back but I never responded. Then last week asked me if I was still in that area (assuming he was trying to gage if I was still meeting up with this ‘nice guy’). He also sent me his son’s new music and said ‘I thought you might have liked this’. Anyway, my question is.. what is going on here? I’ve tried to move on from this and it’s not happening. I feel like everytime he messages me, he pulls me back in like he has a hold on me. I don’t initiate contact anymore but he always seems to come back and always every 7/8 weeks or so. I’m guessing this is an emotional affair (obviously it was a lot more amped up when we worked together). It’ll be interesting to see how be reacts when he knows I’m moving near his area. But he just likes to keep this good guy image and he has his boundaries yet in the past he has said some pretty filthy stuff to me and blatantly flirted. I just don’t know what to do with this relationship anymore. It’s such a confusing one. Why won’t he let it be? ",1,1769407332.0,adultery,2,0.67,False

Yeah, that's not an accident. And it's not because you lack willpower or self-control. TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, they're literally engineered to hijack your brain's reward system. I've spent months researching this through neuroscience studies, books like *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari, and podcasts from addiction specialists. Here's what I found: these apps operate on the same psychological principles as slot machines and cocaine. No joke.

The scary part? Most people don't realize how deep the hooks go until they try to quit and feel genuine withdrawal symptoms. Anxiety, restlessness, FOMO, irritability. Sound familiar? Let's break down why this happens and what you can actually do about it.

# Step 1: Understand the Hijacking (This Is Your Brain on TikTok)

TikTok's algorithm is terrifyingly good. Within minutes, it learns what makes you tick, your fears, insecurities, desires, humor style. Then it feeds you an endless stream of content calibrated to trigger dopamine hits.

Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist and author of *Dopamine Nation*, explains that our brains evolved to seek pleasure and avoid pain. But modern apps exploit this by creating what she calls ""dopamine overload."" Every scroll, every new video is a micro-reward. Your brain gets flooded with dopamine, the same neurochemical involved in gambling addiction and substance abuse.

The kicker? TikTok uses **variable reward scheduling**. You never know if the next video will be gold or garbage. This unpredictability keeps you hooked harder than if every video was amazing. It's the same mechanism that keeps people pulling slot machine levers.

Cal Newport's research in *Digital Minimalism* shows that these platforms aren't just distracting, they're fundamentally rewiring how our brains process information, making us crave constant stimulation and destroying our ability to focus on anything that doesn't provide instant gratification.

# Step 2: Track Your Usage Without Judgment

Before you can quit, you need to face the truth. Most people severely underestimate their screen time. Install a tracking app or just check your phone's built-in screen time stats. Look at the numbers. Really look at them.

When I finally checked mine, I was spending 3+ hours daily on short-form content. That's 21 hours a week. Over 1,000 hours a year. Imagine what you could do with an extra 1,000 hours.

Don't beat yourself up about the numbers. Remember, this isn't a personal failing. These companies employ teams of PhDs in behavioral psychology whose entire job is making these apps irresistible. The system is rigged against you. But knowing your baseline gives you something to work from.

# Step 3: Go Cold Turkey (Seriously, Delete the Apps)

Half measures don't work with behavioral addictions. You can't ""moderate"" something designed to be unmoderable. Trying to limit TikTok to 30 minutes a day is like telling an alcoholic to have just one beer. The app is engineered to override your self-control.

**Delete TikTok.** Not ""move it to a folder."" Not ""turn off notifications."" Delete it.

I know what you're thinking: ""But I'll miss out on things"" or ""I use it to stay connected."" Real talk? You won't miss anything important. The truly valuable content on TikTok (educational stuff, news, etc.) exists elsewhere in more digestible, less addictive formats.

Expect withdrawal. The first few days will suck. You'll reflexively reach for your phone, feel phantom vibrations, experience genuine anxiety. This is your brain throwing a tantrum because its dopamine supply got cut off. **This discomfort means it's working.**

# Step 4: Replace the Habit (Fill the Void)

Here's where most people fail: they delete the app but don't replace the behavior. Your brain has been trained to reach for TikTok during any moment of boredom, waiting, or discomfort. You need to give it something else.

Keep a physical book in your bag. Download long-form podcasts. I'm obsessed with *Huberman Lab* for science-based protocols on everything from sleep to focus. The episodes are 2+ hours, which forces your attention span to stretch again.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio podcasts from expert sources like research papers, books, and interviews. Built by Columbia grads and AI experts from Google, it lets you set specific goals, whether improving focus, building better habits, or understanding psychology, and generates tailored content you can listen to anytime. You control the depth (quick 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and voice style. It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on what you highlight and discuss with its virtual coach. Honestly beats mindless scrolling since the content actually compounds into real knowledge you can use.

Try Finch, a self-care app that gamifies mental health practices without the addictive doom-scroll. It gives you gentle reminders to do things that actually improve your wellbeing, journaling prompts, breathing exercises, gratitude logs. It's got that dopamine hit element but it's actually building positive habits instead of destroying your attention span.

Pick up a creative hobby that requires your hands. Guitar, drawing, cooking, whatever. The key is choosing something that provides flow state, that deep engagement where time disappears but you're actually creating value instead of just consuming.

# Step 5: Understand Your Triggers

Pay attention to when you instinctively reach for your phone. For most people, it's:

* Moments of boredom (waiting in line, commercial breaks)
* Emotional avoidance (you're anxious, stressed, or sad)
* Social situations that feel uncomfortable
* Procrastination on harder tasks

Once you identify your triggers, you can create specific countermeasures. If you always scroll before bed, put your phone in another room and read instead. If you reach for it during anxiety spikes, try the physiological sigh (two quick inhales through the nose, long exhale through the mouth, this actually calms your nervous system, backed by Stanford research).

# Step 6: Reclaim Your Attention Span

Your ability to focus isn't gone forever, but it needs rehab. Start small. Try reading for just 15 minutes without checking your phone. It will feel impossible at first. Your brain will scream at you to check notifications, scroll, do literally anything else.

Push through. Gradually increase the time. This is like building a muscle that's atrophied. *Deep Work* by Cal Newport is incredible for understanding why sustained focus is becoming a superpower in our distracted world. The book itself is dense (in a good way), forcing you to exercise that attention muscle while learning strategies to protect it.

Another game changer: the Pomodoro Technique. Work in 25-minute focused blocks, then take a 5-minute break. During breaks, do NOT check your phone. Walk around, stretch, stare at the wall. Let your mind be bored. Boredom is where creativity and problem-solving happen.

# Step 7: Find Real Connection

TikTok creates an illusion of connection. You feel like you're part of communities, engaged in culture, connected to people. But it's synthetic. Those parasocial relationships don't fulfill your actual need for human connection.

Prioritize face-to-face interactions. Text a friend to grab coffee instead of watching TikToks about friendship. Join a local group, class, or club. Ash is a mental health app with real coaches you can chat with, actual humans helping you process emotions instead of numbing them with scrolling.

The loneliness epidemic is real, and ironically, social media makes it worse. Studies show that the more time people spend on these platforms, the more isolated and depressed they feel. Your brain knows the difference between real connection and digital simulation.

# Step 8: Prepare for Social Pressure

People will think you're weird for not having TikTok. You'll miss references, inside jokes, trending sounds. You might feel left out of conversations. Here's the hard truth: **that FOMO is manufactured**.

You're not actually missing anything meaningful. You're missing the shared experience of being collectively addicted to the same app. Is that really something worth participating in?

Stand firm. When people ask why you don't have TikTok, say something like, ""It was messing with my mental health"" or ""I'm reclaiming my time."" Most people will respect that. Some might even get inspired to try it themselves.

# Step 9: Protect Your Recovery

After a few weeks, you'll feel amazing. Your focus improves, anxiety decreases, you have more time, more energy, more presence. This is when you're most vulnerable to relapse.

Your brain will try to convince you that you've ""fixed"" the problem and can now use TikTok in moderation. **This is a lie.** The algorithm hasn't changed. The addictive design is still there. Reinstalling the app will put you right back where you started, often worse because now you know what you're missing.

If you need short-form video for something specific (like learning a recipe or a dance move), watch on a desktop browser where the experience is clunkier and less addictive. Set a timer. Have a friend hold you accountable.

# Step 10: Measure What Matters

Track what you're gaining, not just what you're losing. Keep a simple log:

* Books read per month
* Conversations with friends
* Projects completed
* Hours of quality sleep
* General mood and anxiety levels

After 30 days without TikTok, most people report sleeping better, feeling less anxious, having more energy, and actually finishing things they start. These are real improvements in your quality of life, not just abstract benefits.

*The Shallows* by Nicholas Carr explores how the internet is literally changing our brain structure. The neuroplasticity that allows TikTok to rewire your brain for distraction works both ways, you can rewire it back toward focus, depth, and meaningful engagement with life.

Look, quitting TikTok isn't some moral crusade against technology. It's about recognizing when a tool stops serving you and starts using you. These apps are designed by some of the smartest people in the world to be irresistible. The fact that you're struggling isn't a personal weakness. It's a rational response to an irrational level of manipulation.

You deserve to own your attention, your time, your mental energy. TikTok doesn't give you any of that. It takes, and takes, and takes. The only way to win is to stop playing the game entirely.",2,1769406981.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

I have been using aeropress filters in my moka pot from the start of my coffee journey. Yesterday afternoon I finally finished the pack, thus resulting in me having to brew a cup without one.

The brew didn’t look as clean without the paper filter, the flow was more unstable and more bubbly. But the final cup tasted much richer compared to with a paper filter. It had less acidity, and more of a chocolatey flavour, with a velvety texture.

I will be brewing this coffee for a month without paper filters, trying different blends, and after the month will go back to using them to see if there is actually that much of a difference.

I jnow that this method of evaluation is not efficient but….yeah.

I am not sure if discussions like these have already been done in this subReddit.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Have you guys seen a weird infomercial that comes on at 3 am with a really pretty lady in it? It comes on really late at night, like three in the morning. I only saw it cause I had a pretty shitty day at work, and when I have a pretty shitty day at work, I tend to stay up pretty late from the anxiety. My job isn’t too bad, really just a lot of admin stuff, but there’s one thing that makes it kinda sucky. 

There’s this guy, Stu, who works in my office. He hasn’t ever technically done anything to me, so everyone I’ve talked to about it, including HR, said that since Stu hasn’t done anything serious to me yet, I don’t have a leg to stand on. So it just keeps going on, and it's kind of ruining my life. It might be easier to understand if I walk you through a typical day for me. 

I leave my house in the morning and go down to my car in the complex parking lot. Stu is there and has been for the last 2 months, just there, just watching. He doesn’t live here; I don’t even think he lives in the county. But he keeps showing up, and he just watches me. Sometimes he’s smiling, sometimes he looks really angry. I think it changes depending on what I’m wearing, but I try not to make eye contact now. I get in my car, and then he gets in his, a beet-red sedan, and he follows me to work, which again isn’t really a problem because he works there too. Then he gets in the elevator with me, and if I’m really unlucky, it’s just us. And *again,* he doesn’t do anything, but when I look up, I can see him looking at me in the warped reflection of the metal elevator doors. Maybe it's the way the reflection stretches his body like taffy, but it always frightens me how he looks. He is always breathing so heavily when it is just us in the elavator and my mind turns him into a wolf, huffing and puffing, and I feel like a pig, shaking in my straw house. 

Then, the doors open and the reflection is hidden inside the walls, like it was never there, and I feel silly and scared all at once. So I go to my office, a tucked-away and tiny thing hidden in a corner, and I feel a little better. I used to share the office with this older guy, Phil, but he just retired last week. Phil was nice enough, and he was really the only person who talked to me there. He kind of reminded me of my dad, too, which was a bittersweet thing, since his death in a drunk driving accident had spurred my move to a whole new state, trying to get away from all that tragedy, even if it meant I didn’t know anyone in this city. I was gonna make friends at some point, I was just working myself up to it. 

The floor I work on is going through some remodeling, and most people migrated to other floors of the building to avoid the noise and fuss. So it’s just me, Phil, another two other admin personnel, Dolores and Fred, who were in an office adjacent to ours. For whatever reason, they didn’t seem to care for me, nor did any of my other coworkers whenever I saw them in the cafeteria or getting coffee, but I figured that was because I hadn’t really made an effort to be social, so maybe they thought I was rude or something. Phil was nice though, he’d bring me slices of pie his wife made because “it was too good not share” and would call me stuff like “kiddo” or “buckaroo”. I thought that he really saw me as a friend, maybe.  I told him a little bit about what was going on with Stu, and he told me it's important to watch my surroundings and suggested buying a gun. I told him I didn’t know how to use one, but I did go to the police after he kept showing up at my complex. He showed up in the evenings, too, but I didn’t always see him. Sometimes it made me more nervous when I couldn’t spot him, wondering if he was somewhere watching me, or somewhere waiting for me. 

“Stu told them he has a sick aunt that lives there so that’s why he’s there so much. The police said until he…hurts me, that there’s nothing they can do.” I told him. Phil shrugged. 

“Eh, maybe he does. The guy is a little off, but cops are right, until he gets his hands on you, he’s in the clear.” Phil agreed and sipped his coffee. I nodded too, tears welling up in my eyes. All of them, HR, the cops, and Phil used words like that,  “until”. They were all sure he was gonna hurt me, did not deny that they saw a lit fuse leading to a powder keg, leading to me, but nothing could be done till something exploded. 

Phil retired last week, we had a little party, and then he packed up his desk. I gave him a gift card to an Italian place and a card with a puppy in a grey wig and glasses that read “Old dogs will learn new tricks when they get new hips!” He thought it was funny and patted me on the shoulder,

“Thanks kid, I hope everything works out for ya. And I hope I don’t see you on the news. Keep your eyes open, and let someone know when something really bad happens.” He told me. 

“I’ll try.” I managed, my eye twitching. 

The Monday after Phil retired, there was no Stu in my parking lot at my complex. There was no sign of his hungry eyes or his beet-red sedan. I must have spun around a thousand times in that parking lot looking for him, and when I still didn’t find him I laughed, so relieved and felt a hesitant lightness return to me, like a large stone being taken off my chest. I drove to work, glancing in my rearview for signs of Stu, my anxiety telling me that maybe I was being too optimistic, maybe Stu switched cars so I would think he gave up on me. Then again, maybe he did find someone else to watch. There was the new girl in marketing, she was really gorgeous, and maybe Stu thought so too. This thought didn’t really make me feel better, I didn’t want her to have to worry about Stu either. I didn’t want anybody to feel all the things I’ve been feeling for the past two months. 

When I got to work, I saw that beet-red sedan parked in the company lot, and felt another rock leave my chest. Maybe he just gave up, maybe I was too boring to watch all the time. Maybe he really did have a sick aunt who lived at my complex, and she got better or died, so he had no reason to keep showing up. I got to ride the elevator by myself, no huffing and puffing beast snarling at me in the reflection, no hot, angry breath on the back of my neck. I was finally starting to feel a little better. 

It all came crashing down pretty quickly. I walked into my office, and there he was, at Phil’s old desk, with his own monitors set up, a little brass nameplate perched on the edge of his desk, “Stu Sangler IT Specialist.”

 He looked at me over the monitors and blinked three times as he looked me over.

**Crunch**

**Crunch**

**Crunch**

 Every blink of his eye felt like a bite taken out of me, an animal devouring me, a gnashing, white-toothed, blood-soaked maw tearing flesh from bone, leaving me a raw mess of muscle tendons. But another feeling too, somehow, like layers of muck were being painted over my own skin, and I felt heavy, the stones returned, the marrow in my bones turning to heavy cement, weighing me down to the threshold of that door. Words flooded my brain, *“he hasn’t done anything wrong yet!” “Until he hurts you, there’s nothing we can do!” “When he gets his hands on you, then that’s something to report!”*

*Yet!*

**Crunch**

*Until*

**Crunch**

*When*

**Crunch**

All these words, used with the certainty that he would do something to me. And what was I going to do about it? What could I do about it? I told my boss, I told someone I trusted, I told the police, and they all said the same thing. They spoke like it was obvious, my fate a done deal, and they seemed confused on why I was confused they didn’t seem to care!  I was in the belly of a snake with no way out, so what was the point of doing anything about it? I was already being digested. When did this happen? When did I get swallowed up like this? Did I walk into his jaws without even knowing it? Maybe I smiled too long at him? Or in the wrong way? Maybe I said something to make him think this was okay? Either way, the walls of the serpent’s stomach were tightening around me, and I could feel the stomach acid disolving its way into my soul, hissing *Yet Until When.* 

I sat at my desk. I worked. Stu watched. His thin lips twitched in a way that unnerved me when I glanced up and saw that he was, in fact, still watching me. He worked too, sometimes I think, typing at his computer, but other times his two monitors would go black from inactivity, and I would just see the whites of big drooling eyes, like rotten marbles gleaming and glassy in his darkened corner. 

He was back at my complex the next morning. I think he gave me a break the day before just to see the look on my face when I saw him there in my office, the devastation of thinking the nightmare I was in was over, only to find it was inescapable. And maybe he knew somehow that I didn’t have the will to fight this in any other way. I could get a new job, but he still knew where I lived. I could move, but I knew he would just follow me. There was some benefit, I guess to working with my stalker; at least I knew where he was for a good chunk of the day. It is the only piece of optimism I have. I was just waiting *until.* 

*Until* seemed to be drawing closer. Stu was escalating now that we were in an enclosed space together for so much of the day. Not in any way that would be taken seriously if reported, we both knew, but in ways that he knew would signal to me that he was going to do something soon. One day in the late afternoon, after not speaking a word the entire time, he rose from his desk and closed our office door. He locked it; the clicking of the lock into place made me jump, sounding to me like a guillotine slamming down. 

“Isn’t that something? This door locks.” He said, and then ran his hands across the dark wood paneling beside it.

“No windows either, what a cozy little space this is. I’m so glad Mark in HR approved my little move here.”

“Mark approved it?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

“Yeah, we’re old buddies. He doesn’t really get why I even want to be in the office, since my job is supposed to be a remote position.” He told me. 

“Oh. So why don’t you just work from home?” 

“Well, it’s just nice to see people everyday you know? Plus, you’d be so lonely next week if I weren’t here.”

“Next week? Why?” I asked my mouth becoming dry. 

“Oh that’s right, you don’t really keep up with the staff here, little miss loner! Dolores is going on maternity leave, and Fred is finally taking that trip to Peru he always wanted to. So you’d be all by yourself, no one else is really close by.” He explained and stared deep into me, a thin smile on his face.

“Oh.” Was all I managed, and I stared at my screens, my eyes blurry from the tears I couldn’t stop from welling. He played with the lock some more, clicking it in and out of place like it was a game. 

“Do you really have a sick aunt who lives at my apartment?” I asked, finally, with pathetic tears rolling down my cheeks. He looked annoyed, then amused. 

“That’s a real personal question, Sophie, pretty inappropriate to ask. Especially since the police already said they believed me. What did they say exactly when you tattled to them?”

“They said…until you hurt me, there’s nothing they can do. I asked them if they can do something about you and they said “Not yet”. I said shakily. He nodded, already knowing the answer. 

“Have I hurt you Sophie?” He asked with mocking concern. I shook my head.

“No. I guess not.” I admitted.

“So don’t be so skittish around me then hon. It’s kind of embarrassing. People know me, they know I’m a good guy. They don’t know you. You never tried to know them, so they just know what I told them.”  
  
“What? What do you mean?”

“You just never tried to talk to anyone here, so that was your first mistake. Alot of the older folk here, if you don’t make an effort to engage with them they think that you think that you’re better than them. You seem pretty uppity Sophie. I don’t use this word, but I will say other people in the office have. You seem like a bitch Sophie.” He said with an apologetic half-grin. 

“I just come in and work, I haven’t done anything to anyone.” I said.

“Oh I hear you Soph, I do. But because you not talking to any folks, they began to wonder about you, what your deal was. Since you were a blank canvas, I could paint any picture I wanted.”

“You made stuff up about me?” I asked, bewildered, my face growing hot. 

“You had an affair at your last gig with your married boss. Hence, the dramatic transfer to another state. You broke up a family, Sophie, a beautiful family with a loving wife, a son, a daughter, even a golden retriever. I know of course because my cousin worked at your old company, and he told me all about you when he found out you were transferring over here.”

“None of that is true. Not a goddamn word! Oh my god, you’ve been telling people this? And they’ve been believing it?”

“Well it doesn’t help that you’re stunning Sophie. It made sense to them, that someone that looks like you would do something like that.” I backed up as he approached, stupidly lodging myself in a corner. He blocked my way and grinned down at me. 

“Did I do something to you?” I asked. He thought for a moment and then laughed.

“Not yet.” He leered

He stepped back then, grabbed his bag and slung it across his chest. He went to the door, unlocked it and grinned back at me, still shaking in the corner. 

“Have a good weekend Soph. Ease up on the booze, word around the office is you’re kind of a lush. You’ve gone on benders before and go missing for days, sometimes even weeks. Everyone knows, so just be careful.” He said before walking out of the office. I curled up on the ground, hugging my knees to my chest and turning into a puddle of sobs. 

Maybe if all this could happen to me, all these traps set and triggered to perfection, maybe I deserved whatever *until* was going to be. It felt so definite, whatever it was that was coming my way. Maybe he would just kill me and that would be it. It was the most positive thought I could manage right now. I barricaded my door when I got home, and my windows. I curled up on the couch wrapped in blankets with the biggest knife I owned on my coffee table and half watched the tv and half listened to any sound I heard. Eventually, with the tv illuminating my face, I slumped over on my couch and fell into a deep sleep. 

**“Sophie!”** a voice boomed, making me shoot upright, my hand grabbed at the knife and I slashed wildly at the air but thankfully, there was no one there. The only source of sound was my tv, likely I thought playing some infomercial for a useless kitchen gadget, my mouth dropped at the image on the screen. 

There was a woman, the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, staring at me from the screen. Her face was just perfect. I don’t think there are any words known to any man that can properly relay her divine features. Her smile did actually glitter, and her eyes, a rich golden color, did actually glow as she looked at me. The woman’s face was framed by thick, shining dark curls that reached down to her ankles. She was dressed in a turquoise suit, finely tailored, and long peacock feather earrings dangled from her lobes. A crown also glistened from her head, large egg-sized gems fitted into the gold crown. The crown made sense, I thought, this woman struck me immediately as someone who should be in charge of everything. The woman sat in a throne, the back of which had peacock feathers sticking out in every direction. She tapped her finger impatiently on the ornament of a staff she held, a glowing lotus flower. We looked at each other a second, and then I realized that was silly because we couldn’t be, and then she rolled her eyes. 

“Sophie, are you ready, dear?” She sighed. I blinked rapidly and then did the thing people do in movies where they rub their eyes to make sure they’re actually seeing what they think they are. The woman sighed heavy, but still looked friendly.

“It is real. I am talking to you Sophie Rose Michaels, born May 14th, 1999, blood type O-Negative. Shall we?” She asked. I nodded obediently despite not knowing what “we” were doing. It felt correct to take orders from her. She smiled as I thought this, and I wondered if she heard it somehow. She smoothed out her garments and gestured outward with her staff. 

“Has this ever happened to you?” She asked in the typical infomercial cadence. But what played on the screen was not the stereotypical black and white shots of people struggling with unruly plastic wrap, or mountains or tupperware avalanching from a cabinet onto a poor housewife; it was actual moments from my life. There on the screen was the first day Stu showed up at my complex, then every day following, there were flashes of me reporting the repeated behavior to HR, to the police, to Phil, to no avail. There were things I hadn’t seen before, either, moments I hadn’t been privy to, Stu whispering about me to coworkers, Stu watching me grocery shopping and running errands from a different car than the one I knew, then, more jarring, Stu in my apartment. Stu in my apartment, going through my trash, going through my underwear drawer. Then, even worse, Stu in my apartment with me. Stu standing over me as I slept, not one time, many of these clips played, my blood chilling. All those mornings when he was waiting for me in the parking lot, I always just thought he had pulled into the lot and waited for me. I never thought he had ever truly gotten that close, and so many times, too. How could I be so frightened and so unaware at the same time? The last clip that played was from the day before, Stu cornering me in the office, his eyes layering more of that heavy filth feeling over my skin with every glance. The scenes faded away, and the impossibly beautiful woman was back, her eye fixed on me. 

“Well, has it?” She asked after a moment.

“Huh?” I asked, my mind frazzled into a million different pieces. 

“Has that ever happened to you?” She asked again. 

“Oh! Yes, it *was* me.” I answered. 

“Wonderful! Then you need “Rent-A-Gus-Gus!” She proclaimed happily and clapped her hands. Flower petals fell from the ceiling as she did, and the camera pulled back, revealing a large turquoise colored present box covering something. She approached the box and then looked to me, af if I was supposed to say something. 

“Don’t you want to know what it is?” She asked, gesturing towards the large gift. I nodded, my eyes transfixed. 

“Rent-A-Gus-Gus is a premium service designed to fix any problems you might be having with overzealous lookie-loos! Don’t you hate that feeling you get when someone is watching you nonstop without your consent?” 

“Yes.” I asked, my heart beat becoming loud in my ears.

“Doesn’t it make you feel filthy? And isn’t that unfair? You’re not doing anything wrong.”

“It is unfair.” I agreed, licking my lips.  
  
“Don’t you deserve to feel safe walking down the street? At work? In your own home?” 

“Yes, I do. I do deserve that.”

“Have other methods, like reporting this behavior to trusted people, failed you?”

“Yes.”

“And doesn’t Stu deserve to be punished for this? Everyone is telling you he hasn’t done anything to you yet, but hasn’t he? He has taken your sense of self, made you a wounded animal waited to be finished off, but is that who you are?”

“No!”

“Good! Then simply say, “I want to Rent-A-Gus-Gus” and we can have one at your door in no time. They’ll be some rules sent with the little guy to read over but the whole thing is really simple! Just bring Gus Gus to work with you and he’ll handle the rest!”

“How much does it cost?” I asked entranced.

“Its sort of a symbiotic payment. As long as Gus Gus does gets to do his the job you need him to, then we’re all settled.” She explained. 

“Oh okay.” I said unsure and then cleared my throat. 



“I want to Rent-A-Gus-Gus.” I said and as soon as the last syllable left my lips the screen turned black and a ***KNOCKKNOCKKNOCK*** pounded at my door. I rose, knife in hand, and approached the door. I removed the chair I had jammed under the door handle and peeked through the eyeball but saw no one there. With my knife at the ready, I opened my door, slowly, and peered out. There wasn’t anyone out there but there was that large turquoise present from the infomercial, sitting right on my doorstep. I should’ve been questioning how any of this worked, how the stunning woman who possessed such inhuman beauty was able to actually talk to me through my screen, how she was able to show me that awful footage of Stu watching me, and how this package literally showed up at my door as soon as I said I wanted it. I didn’t though, I was half in a trance I think from speaking to that woman, and half drunk with the idea of Stu not being a problem anymore.  So I drug the package in, it was heavy and took some serious effort to even get over the threshold of my door into my living room. The package was about the size of a mini fridge, and the wrapped paper that covered felt expensive somehow, as did the golden bow that accented it. The woman from the infomercial said that the package would come with instructions, although I didn’t even know what the “package” even was yet. I undid the golden bow, and the walls of the package came down. Inside, something spherical was wrapped in a golden blanket, a small handwritten note stapled to the fabric. In fine handwriting it read,



*Dear Sophie,*

*I am pleased to you decided to accept my bargain to utilize my premium Rent-A-Gus-Gus service. A couple of things to note, 1. Do not be alarmed by GusGus’s appearance, he is a gentle creature and will not harm you 2. If able, keep GusGus away from mailmen and any Ford Mercury automobiles, as they greatly upset GusGus. 3. When you are ready to activate GusGus simple whisper to him “Awake my watchman” and he will do the rest. Rest east Sophie, you are nearly free.* 

*With warm wishes,*

*A friend*

*P.S. If you need a little extra bravery, cut a square of the fleece wrapped around GusGus, and use it wipe any tears that may fall.* 



I read the note a few times, unsure what to make of it, or the spherical bundle on the ground. I began to unwrap the blanket surrounding the sphere and jumped back when I saw what it was hiding. Inside the wrapped bundle, was flesh, wrapped around the sphere. It was not smooth, but covered in bulbous lumps, all across its surface. I rolled the sphere over, examining it, and found what seemed to be a slit of some kind that stretched from across one side of the creature, with dark hairs linging its top and bottom. With nothing else to do, I poked at it and the slit fluttered briefly open then closed again but it was enough for me to understand: it was an eyeball, a big eyeball with giant lashes and big weird pimples covering its surface. This was going to help me somehow? What kind of deal had I made? 

  
The next morning I threw GusGus in a bowling bag and headed down to my car. Stu was there in the lot, his head turned curiously at the sight of my bowling bag. I drove carefully to work, nervous that a speedbump or a hard stop might upset the creature. I saw the beet-red sedan in my rearview, and let myself wonder what it would be like to never have to see it again. I began to salivate. 

I got to work, and into the elevator alone, luckily. I practically sprinted into my office and sat the bag down gently, my breath ragged from the weight of carrying it. I almost went to unzip it when I heard Stu enter, and I stilled my hand, looking up at him like he caught me doing something I shouldn’t be. 

“What’s with the bag Sophie?"" He asked me, curious, making his way to his desk and sitting down, his eyes never leaving me. I shook my head.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“You’ve never brought a bowling ball bag to work before, and I doubt you’ve taken up a new hobby, so what’s in it? Something to protect yourself?” He asked with a grin. I steeled myself.

“Maybe it is,” I said. He raised an eyebrow.

“What is it? A gun? Are you gonna shoot me at work? That won’t look goo,d will it?” 

“It’s not a gun,” I said. I carried the bag with me and set it in the middle of the room, right between our two desks and locked the door. 

“Dolores and Fred are gone, right? It’s just us?” I asked. For the first time, Stu seemed uncomfortable. This dynamic switch was throwing him off kilter, me as well if I’m being honest; my palms were sweat-soaked even as my words were strong. 

“It is just us. Keep that in mind. You’re not gonna scare me, little girl. You think I’ve only been following you to your apartment and watching you at work? You don’t know the half of it.” He smiled. I felt the tears begin to fall as the scenes I was shown last night played in my head, and reached into my pocket, using the golden square I cut to dry my pathetic eyes. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, my back straightened, and the tears stopped. 

 “You have a piss-yellow Toyota that you follow me around sometimes, so I don’t know it’s you. You come into my apartment a couple of times a week and watch me sleep, and sometimes when I’m not there, too. You take my hair from my brush, and my nail clippings from my trash.” 

“How did you-” He began rising from his chair, a startled expression on his face.

“You’re going to hurt me soon. I can’t get much more scared, and that’s your thing, right? That’s how you’ve done it before. You find a girl who doesn’t have anyone in her life, and you get her really scared and then you hurt her. And you make sure that anyone she might tell knows “what kind” of girl she is, so that when she’s gone, no one is surprised. You did it to Lola in Tampa, and to Ellen in Medford, and now is it supposed to be me next? Sophie in St.Louis?” I keep my voice steady as the words pour out of me, words that I had no idea how I knew, but I could tell they were the truth; the look on Stu’s face also confirmed it for me. He stood frozen in place behind his desk, his face twisted in a mix of pure rage and confusion.

“You don’t know a goddamn thing!” He yelled. As if possessed, I laughed, and strode over to the bowling ball bag, unzipped it, and brought my lips down to the creature inside. 

“Awake, my watchman,” I said. The bulbous things I mistook for pimples sprang open, revealing themselves to be eyes of all different colors, glancing wildly around as I removed the creature from the bag. The large slit opened, revealing a shining golden eye. The large eye looked to me, then to Stu, and seemed to understand what it was meant to do. 

“What-what the fuck is that?” Stu shouted, trembling and backing himself into the corner by his desk. 

The sight of him, shaking in the corner, a dark stain spreading around his groin and dripping down his leg, it warmed something in me. The creature began to float just about level with Stu’s head, and thin red, veiny tendrils shot out of it like an octopus. It shot the tendrils into each of Stu’s eyes and began to pull. Stu dropped to his knees, crying out as he did, begging for it to stop. I did not move, I just watched as the creature pulled Stu’s eyes out of their sockets, those dreadful eyes that had caused me so much strife these past months. They stretched so much longer than I thought they would, and began to come out like strange red film reels. I saw all of the awful things he did with his eyes, not just all the things he did to me, but to so many others. It went on for miles. Sick images he had locked in his memory of women and girls changing in dressing rooms, going to the bathroom, women on the bus whose skirts he slipped a camera under. He grew pale as the last of the reel was yanked away with a sickening snap, and he fell face-first into the grey carpet of the office floor, blood leaking out from under his skull. The creature retracted the red tendrils, and as it did, two new bumps emerged from its flesh. They opened and looked around wildly, and I realized I knew those eyes well. I realized what the woman from the infomercial meant when she said this was a symbiotic exchange. As I wondered what to do with Stu’s body the creature began to coo at the door. The door opened despite the lock, and panic surged inside me, the fear of being caught with a dead body suddenly becoming my very real reality. 

But, ducking elegantly under the door frame, was the woman from the infomercial, even more beautiful up close. She wore the same turquoise suit, carried the lotus-topped staff, and wore that gleaming crown. As if on instinct, I dropped to my knees and pressed my nose to that ugly grey carpet. The woman chuckled, and it sounded like the loveliest sound I’ve ever heard, and I was confident that nothing would ever compare. 

“Rise dear, you have nothing to fear from me, we’ve both kept up our ends of the bargain, haven’t we?” She said and doted lovingly on GusGus, who romped around at her feet like an excited puppy with stubby legs I didn't realize he had. I rose slowly, keeping my eyes to the ground before she lifted my chin up with one firm finger. 



“How do you feel? Better?” She asked.

“So much better,” I answered immediately, not even having to think about it. When that awful film reel was plucked from Stu’s skull, I felt those layers of muck and fear he coated onto me melt away; my skin felt new, light, and clean. 

“Good. Tell your friends if they have a similar issue.” She said and scrunched her nose up at the sight of Stu’s still-warm corpse. I chimed in.

“Thank you for all your help, I don’t mean to like ask too much or anything, but it will be a bad thing for me if people find his body like this.” I said awkwardly. She nodded understanding, and in a moment, the body was gone, as if never there. 

“All tied up then! We will be off then, a pleasure Sophie.” She said and began to leave. 

“Wait, if you could do that, why do you use him?” I asked, nodding toward GusGus. She smiled sadly down at him.

“He was a giant once, a grand behemoth to behold with 100 eyes. More importantly, he was a loyal friend. It has taken some time but I am working to restore him to his former glory, maybe even more marvelous than before. It’s what he deserves. As far as why I do this, well that I’ve already said: it's symbiotic. You help me with this ritual, one that requires a sacrifice, and you get to choose your sacrifice. Many people do not deserve their eyes, that I know you know. Such a gift used for such filth, such perverted violence. They do not deserve them; my GusGus will make better use of them. Don’t you agree?” She asked and GusGus waddled his form over to me, nuzzling into my side. I bent over and scratched behind an eyelid, which seemed to be met with an approving coo. 

I have never felt more grateful for an infomercial. My very soul feels lighter, I don’t have to keep looking over my shoulder, I don’t have to wait *until.* So, I guess all this to say, if you’re going through something similar, call 1-800-REN-TGUS or go to [RENTGUSGUS.com](http://rentgusgus.com) and use promo code SophieSTL to get free cleanup after a completed ritual! Sorry, I didn’t disclose earlier that this was an ad, but I just really believe in this company. Stay safe out there, and don’t wait *until.* ",1,1769406053.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I also appreciate the people who play devil’s advocate, just so I can see a different perspective! With all of that said, I received another text today from MIL. I did not respond yesterday because I didn’t know what to say, and I don’t think she liked that. This is the text I got today:

“Good afternoon! Just wanted to follow up and see if you recieved my texts yesterday afternoon. I know I dont always see my new texts. Thank you”

I took awhile to figure out exactly what to say, and actually went with one of the ideas in this thread. I thought it was very respectful but straightforward. My DH agreed and I sent it. This is what I sent:

“Thanks for reaching out, (MIL). At the moment, there isn’t much about the pregnancy to talk about. We are trying to keep life simple and stress free - not really planning anything beyond that at the moment. Myself and baby are healthy, and (DH) and I are slowly sorting out what our preferences are. If and when we have updates, (DH) will share them with you! Thank you for understanding!”

Her response was the following:

“Maybe we can clear something up, if you don't mind. Is it me you don't want to hang out with or you don't want to discuss the baby? The baby is not the only reason I was asking to see you. I'm happy to get coffee and just be. No set date, no pressure or expectations. Just a road to friendship. If it's me, well that's something different. Awkward question but thank you for understanding why it would be nice to know. “

I feel like she is trying to save face and control the narrative of the conversation. She had shown zero signs of wanting a friendship with me (actually the opposite) prior to her texting my husband with her complaints about how I don’t communicate with her about our baby information. I feel that the conversation changed direction after I made the boundary clear - that we won’t be pressured into sharing information. Then she changed it to “I want friendship”. Am I reaching with this one? Part of me questions whether I’m over analyzing because my nervous system is on edge with her, or if it’s just pattern recognition? Thoughts? 

Also, DH is going to be reaching out to her tomorrow (in writing) and making it clear that there will be no more guilt tripping or entitlement going forward. I will not be responding to her last message, nor will I be communicating any updates - only my DH will be.",16,1769406045.0,motherinlawsfromhell,5,0.94,False
1qn7hfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qn7hfe/should_i_have_lied_on_my_application/,Should I have lied on my application?,"Context: I recently got fired from a part-time grocery store position because a coworker left their bag of edibles and our manager saw me taking one they offered after hours thru cameras when they looked to find out who owned them (dumbass decision, I know). It was the only issue that had ever come up in my time working there as I was a great employee, received two raises, and was even trusted with handling store money. I'm 19 and, other than the instance that got me fired, have literally never done drugs before. 

I applied to work at a coffee shop I frequent and was nervous about answering the ""have you ever been discharged from an employer?, if so please explain"" question on the application. My sister said to put that I was simply involved in a situation where an employee violated company policy, but a few days after sending in the application my mom and my other sibling both thought it wasn't a good idea and said I shouldn't have put anything. 

I was nervous even putting my past job as a reference because I wasn't sure how much they could say if the coffee shop did end up calling and asking about me. Personally, being honest felt better than lying and risking a job I've been wanting very badly, and aside from that one question on the application I was told my explanations for wanting the job/qualifications and experience were very well written if that means anything. I'm worried that if the coffee place sees that one part they won't even give me a chance to interview. As per the cafe manager's recommendation I'm even willing to call their main office to hopefully increase my chances.

It's been hard finding a job I'd be comfortable/happy at for the next few years 'til I'm out of college and I'm *really* hoping I didn't blow this one for being honest about why I was fired. ",1,1769405971.0,careerguidance,2,0.99,False

I get told by my doctors that I keep dropping weight which isn’t good or purposeful, but it’s genuinely not an underlying issue like a disorder, I have no negative body images Im just never hungry. Maybe it’s because I drink coffee every day and it usually takes me all day to finish it? So maybe Im just full off liquid, but other than that I have no desire to eat unless I am literally starving.

Hey, how's it going? Good? I hope so. Me? Bored as all living hell.
I’m traveling through deep space aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. Rarely does anything interesting happen, once in a blue moon. Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space, wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. 

I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. It’s not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on the Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.

So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself, when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.

“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You’ve got to show me how the energy converter works, and explain it so I actually understand it this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to bother me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.

I groaned, running on way too little sleep, and brushed her away.

This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. She’s a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I don’t know why, but she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer master, It’s never gonna happen. She’s sweet, aside from waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.

“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen as I followed behind, dreadfully.

“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.

This is Captain Macross. He’s a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person who can run this slow ship without making it a living hell. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to be flying around in this tin can.

Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. The captain’s right-hand man, he mostly manages the supplies. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, has no muscles, and looks like he’d snap in half just by standing next to the captain. Still, there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. He could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.

“Poorly,” I said, grabbing some coffee. “Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?”

That’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and it certainly won’t be my last.

“Because the chef said so!” Comet said, while handing me a plate full of eggs and bacon. 

I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off nutritional gel. That said, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to ever go back to that job or eating corporate slop.

“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain asked, mouth still full of food.

“Depends,” I said before taking a sip of coffee. “Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.

He wiped his mouth, still laughing. “HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! Engine room again, I’m guessing? We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”

“Noted.” I stood and took my plate to the sink.

“Oh, here. I’ll take that.” Comet said, washing the dishes.

“Thanks.”

“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”

“Ok.” I left and made my way to the engine room. 

The lights flickered on the way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching the engine room, it's practically my second room with how long I spend cooped up in here. Still, I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve worked with metal my whole life, it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.

“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled.

“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”

“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said. It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.

Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to get Comet to do anything that wouldn’t dismantle it, then fixing the problems she somehow created. This went on for a while until the captain’s voice rang out from the speaker.
“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” 

Probably needed something to be fixed again, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.

I should mention Pavo real quick. Our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms. This helps with our limited space, and his low battery life.

Pavo is an ancient model, I’m honestly surprised the captain and Icarus would keep such a thing with them. Still, despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times.

“Need something, captain?”

“Ah, there you are.” He patted the dead radar. “Pavo saw something before it died. Think you can fix it?”

“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship: it’s easy to fix. No cutting-edge systems, no learning on the fly. Just broken parts I already know how to deal with.

“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn…something was.

“Huh? What was that?” I said. There was a second where the radar picked up something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.

“Yeah, this can’t be good.” The captain muttered. “It might be some debris floating past us.”
 
“And what do you really think it is?” I remarked, “Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”

“Hmmm. Pavo, you picking anything up from the motion sensors?”

“Negative, captain. No signs of movement outside the ship.”

“It’s never too late to say it was just a glitch,” I remarked.

“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep an eye out for any movement or interference and report back to me on any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with the others a—” The lights died. No flicker, no dimming, just sudden darkness. Not the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.

“The lights? Captain, think this has to do with something outside, or …want to bet this is Comet’s doing?” my eyes slowly adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.

“I don’t know. Pavo, you good?”

“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights from emergency systems still glowed faintly around us.

“Everything but the lights? Why?... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!” 

The captain frowned. “Yeah, seems like a small bunch. They don’t usually come this close to inhabited space. They’re either wanderers, or got caught up in some kind of dark matter expansion.”

“There are still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.” I said.

“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on my ship!”

“Yes sir, Captain Macross.”

“Good. Fornax.” The captain opened a small box and handed me one of two flashlights. “Let’s go find the others.”

The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark chamber of the ship. Surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and deadly entities floating about.

“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”

“Yep. That’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me. The loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” He moves his hands too much when he gets serious. 

“I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up in the engine room, she’s in the safest place. As long as she stays there and doesn’t get involved, we shouldn’t have to worry about her. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” 

Can’t argue with that. Off we went to make sure Icarus is still alive—or so we thought, we heard Comet screaming down the other side of the ship.

“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”

“Come on! We need to save her! She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain shouted, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.

“Wait! What about our gear? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”

The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these.” He held up the flashlights.
“Ultra-bright. Supposed to stun or scare Wraiths.”

I groaned. “You bought them on sale, didn’t you?”

“You’ll thank me later!” The captain faced forward.

We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.
“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights into the engine room.

“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.

“Comet!” The captain shouted. “Oh, thank goodness! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths!” 

“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.

“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, and you're not being attacked… Then why were you screaming?”

“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out I'm not blind, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”

“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright.” The captain sighed in relief. “Can’t have our young star like you getting hurt.”

“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we really need to go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.

“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on, and what this Wraiths thing is.”

“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before-. Click…click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”

The captain held up his. “Well, mine still. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh. That explains the sale. Extra-bright mode drains them completely. One use. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.

“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there’s Wraiths aboard, we have nothing to cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight you just had to buy! Man, I’m getting another headache.”

“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure we can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.

“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet stays out of this and hides in this room, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”

“He's right. You’re too inexperienced with this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you stay safely hidden here, away from what's out there, so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”

“Yes, Captain,” Comet said, then went off into the back of the engine room to collect every light that wasn’t bolted down.

“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.

“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.

“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship once again.

Another sign of Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it gets. I’ve heard stories of ships freezing solid from old Wraith hordes, crews dying where they stood. I’ve never seen proof of it myself, but I’m not interested in finding out firsthand. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just being too close could kill someone instantaneously.

It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine, with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.

“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight,” he said. “Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”

“Y-yeah, b-but someone has t-to keep this s-ship in one p-piece!” I said through chattering teeth. “I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!”

“Hah. Just remember that if it’s getting too hard to breathe, you're already too close. 
I breathed into my hands, to no avail, and we continued on slowly so we wouldn’t stumble into a face full of cold death. The silence gnawed at me as we turned onto the last stretch. All I could hear were my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship, like being stuck in isolation.

“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned, but he was gone. Total silence. I felt the temperature drop as the realization hit all at once. 

“C-..Captain?.......” No response, I wanted to look for him but I really don’t want to go any further without some kind of weapon. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I’d found nearby. If the metal started freezing over, I’d at least have some warning to save my ass before I get a first hand account of the ice age. 

I broke into a run as I saw the loading bay door ahead. The metal in the floors and walls creaked and groaned from the extreme cold and my movement. Breathing became harder as my lungs began to burn with every inhale. My finger felt like they were going to fall off, but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and the rod as I ran. 

Besides being really really cold, this wasn’t the worst that I went through. That was my last normal thought until everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” I didn’t have time or a chance to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side when I got too close to the wall, everything faded to black.

I jolted awake, my eyelashes cracking apart as the ice holding them together broke. Slowly, carefully, I peeled my face and hands off the floor, trying not to lose skin in the process. I felt numb and heavy. Thankfully, I’d dropped the metal rod before losing my hand permanently to it. Frozen snot and mucus clung to my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now being back on as I staggered towards the loading bay, stopping when I saw the captain's back blocking the way.

“C-c… Captain?!” I said. “Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, A-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him aside. 

Icarus on the floor. He was pale, frostbitten, blue-lipped, his fingers frozen stiff. A small pool of spit had run down to the floor, frozen solid. His eyes were open, but even the moisture on his eyes had turned to ice. Frost coated parts of his clothes and spread outward where he’d fallen, crawling across the metal beneath him. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen before it had the chance to spread.

“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.

“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We stood there, staring for a few seconds before he spoke again. “But the lights are back on, though. Pavo called us up when he noticed that the Wraiths were leaving. You were probably too scared to hear anything, huh?” the captain said, poking me in the arm.

“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”

“That’s what Pavo said,” the captain replied. “But those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to thaw everything out and fix the damage they cause! I hope my baby can make it to the next stop.” 

“God damnit! I thought I was finally making some progress. Sigh. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”

“Yeah,” He bent down and hoisted Icarus over his shoulder. “Can't have my right-hand man be dead on the job! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up and get back to work.”

“Good thing our contracts don't dock our pay for incapacitated crewmates.” I said brushing off some melted ice. “And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge, so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”

“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this? Let alone some of the crap our employers pull?” He sighed. “She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave right now.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive chamber near the cockpit.

“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space, or piss off the higher ups. I need a drink.”

And there you go, just a normal day aboard the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you ask me. I had to ask Pavo about this, since I’d forgotten most of the details. Well, besides how long it took to fix the iced cubed ship for months. But I’m glad he recorded this moment; I was having a hard time picking an entry worth sharing. I’d figured this one was fine to show you what our daily lives are like, aside from the long stretches of nothing and endless repairs. Lesson learned: never buy cheap flashlights. Not worth it when nearly freezing to death on the job. 

Let me know if you guys would like to hear more about our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual routine. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death. But that's all for now, later.",1,1769405791.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Interesting points:

>Some moviegoers in China and the U.S. have said the new “Avatar” movie didn’t have a different enough story or a big enough leap forward in visual effects to generate the same excitement as the last two entries.

>In contrast, Chinese audiences were pumped for the sequel to 2016’s “Zootopia,” which was previously the highest grossing American animated film in the country, at $236.1 million. Disney opened a Zootopia-themed land in Shanghai Disneyland in 2023 and has been promoting the franchise in China since that year with public events, partnerships with local companies including Luckin Coffee, and animated shorts released online.

So, saturation is the cause of the (relative) downfall of Fire and Ash. This makes me think Disney will delay Avatar 4 from December 2029.

>The Chinese government in September approved Disney opening the movie in the same week as the U.S. That gave the studio two months to officially advertise “Zootopia 2,” compared with the few weeks most foreign movies get.

>When Disney’s top film executive, Alan Bergman, traveled to the movie’s premiere at Shanghai Disneyland in November and met with his local team, he told them he thought the sequel could significantly outperform the original, despite the recent weakness of the China market. “They thought I was a little crazy,” he recalled.

Hey, how's it going? Good? I hope so. Me? Bored as all living hell.
I’m traveling through deep space aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo.

“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You’ve got to show me how the energy converter works, and explain it so I actually understand it this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to bother me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.

I groaned, running on way too little sleep, and brushed her away.

This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. She’s a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I don’t know why, but she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer master, It’s never gonna happen. She’s sweet, aside from waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.

“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen as I followed behind, dreadfully.

“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.

This is Captain Macross. He’s a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person who can run this slow ship without making it a living hell. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to be flying around in this tin can.

Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. The captain’s right-hand man, he mostly manages the supplies. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, has no muscles, and looks like he’d snap in half just by standing next to the captain. Still, there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. He could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.

“Poorly,” I said, grabbing some coffee. “Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?”

That’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and it certainly won’t be my last.

“Because the chef said so!” Comet said, while handing me a plate full of eggs and bacon. 

I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off nutritional gel. That said, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to ever go back to that job or eating corporate slop.

“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain asked, mouth still full of food.

“Depends,” I said before taking a sip of coffee. “Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.

He wiped his mouth, still laughing. “HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! Engine room again, I’m guessing? We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”

“Noted.” I stood and took my plate to the sink.

“Oh, here. I’ll take that.” Comet said, washing the dishes.

“Thanks.”

“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”

“Ok.” I left and made my way to the engine room. 

The lights flickered on the way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching the engine room, it's practically my second room with how long I spend cooped up in here. Still, I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve worked with metal my whole life, it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.

“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled.

“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”

“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said. It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.

Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to get Comet to do anything that wouldn’t dismantle it, then fixing the problems she somehow created. This went on for a while until the captain’s voice rang out from the speaker.
“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” 

Probably needed something to be fixed again, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.

I should mention Pavo real quick. Our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms. This helps with our limited space, and his low battery life.

Pavo is an ancient model, I’m honestly surprised the captain and Icarus would keep such a thing with them. Still, despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times.

“Need something, captain?”

“Ah, there you are.” He patted the dead radar. “Pavo saw something before it died. Think you can fix it?”

“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship: it’s easy to fix. No cutting-edge systems, no learning on the fly. Just broken parts I already know how to deal with.

“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn…something was.

“Huh? What was that?” I said. There was a second where the radar picked up something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.

“Yeah, this can’t be good.” The captain muttered. “It might be some debris floating past us.”
 
“And what do you really think it is?” I remarked, “Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”

“Hmmm. Pavo, you picking anything up from the motion sensors?”

“Negative, captain. No signs of movement outside the ship.”

“It’s never too late to say it was just a glitch,” I remarked.

“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep an eye out for any movement or interference and report back to me on any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with the others a—” The lights died. No flicker, no dimming, just sudden darkness. Not the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.

“The lights? Captain, think this has to do with something outside, or …want to bet this is Comet’s doing?” my eyes slowly adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.

“I don’t know. Pavo, you good?”

“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights from emergency systems still glowed faintly around us.

“Everything but the lights? Why?... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!” 

The captain frowned. “Yeah, seems like a small bunch. They don’t usually come this close to inhabited space. They’re either wanderers, or got caught up in some kind of dark matter expansion.”

“There are still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.” I said.

“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on my ship!”

“Yes sir, Captain Macross.”

“Good. Fornax.” The captain opened a small box and handed me one of two flashlights. “Let’s go find the others.”

The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark chamber of the ship. Surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and deadly entities floating about.

“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”

“Yep. That’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me. The loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” He moves his hands too much when he gets serious. 

“I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up in the engine room, she’s in the safest place. As long as she stays there and doesn’t get involved, we shouldn’t have to worry about her. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” 

Can’t argue with that. Off we went to make sure Icarus is still alive—or so we thought, we heard Comet screaming down the other side of the ship.

“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”

“Come on! We need to save her! She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain shouted, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.

“Wait! What about our gear? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”

The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these.” He held up the flashlights.
“Ultra-bright. Supposed to stun or scare Wraiths.”

I groaned. “You bought them on sale, didn’t you?”

“You’ll thank me later!” The captain faced forward.

We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.
“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights into the engine room.

“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.

“Comet!” The captain shouted. “Oh, thank goodness! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths!” 

“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.

“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, and you're not being attacked… Then why were you screaming?”

“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out I'm not blind, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”

“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright.” The captain sighed in relief. “Can’t have our young star like you getting hurt.”

“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we really need to go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.

“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on, and what this Wraiths thing is.”

“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before-. Click…click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”

The captain held up his. “Well, mine still. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh. That explains the sale. Extra-bright mode drains them completely. One use. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.

“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there’s Wraiths aboard, we have nothing to cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight you just had to buy! Man, I’m getting another headache.”

“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure we can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.

“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet stays out of this and hides in this room, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”

“He's right. You’re too inexperienced with this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you stay safely hidden here, away from what's out there, so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”

“Yes, Captain,” Comet said, then went off into the back of the engine room to collect every light that wasn’t bolted down.

“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.

“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.

“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship once again.

Another sign of Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it gets. I’ve heard stories of ships freezing solid from old Wraith hordes, crews dying where they stood. I’ve never seen proof of it myself, but I’m not interested in finding out firsthand. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just being too close could kill someone instantaneously.

It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine, with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.

“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight,” he said. “Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”

“Y-yeah, b-but someone has t-to keep this s-ship in one p-piece!” I said through chattering teeth. “I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!”

“Hah. Just remember that if it’s getting too hard to breathe, you're already too close. 
I breathed into my hands, to no avail, and we continued on slowly so we wouldn’t stumble into a face full of cold death. The silence gnawed at me as we turned onto the last stretch. All I could hear were my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship, like being stuck in isolation.

“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned, but he was gone. Total silence. I felt the temperature drop as the realization hit all at once. 

“C-..Captain?.......” No response, I wanted to look for him but I really don’t want to go any further without some kind of weapon. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I’d found nearby. If the metal started freezing over, I’d at least have some warning to save my ass before I get a first hand account of the ice age. 

I broke into a run as I saw the loading bay door ahead. The metal in the floors and walls creaked and groaned from the extreme cold and my movement. Breathing became harder as my lungs began to burn with every inhale. My finger felt like they were going to fall off, but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and the rod as I ran. 

Besides being really really cold, this wasn’t the worst that I went through. That was my last normal thought until everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” I didn’t have time or a chance to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side when I got too close to the wall, everything faded to black.

I jolted awake, my eyelashes cracking apart as the ice holding them together broke. Slowly, carefully, I peeled my face and hands off the floor, trying not to lose skin in the process. I felt numb and heavy. Thankfully, I’d dropped the metal rod before losing my hand permanently to it. Frozen snot and mucus clung to my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now being back on as I staggered towards the loading bay, stopping when I saw the captain's back blocking the way.

“C-c… Captain?!” I said. “Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, A-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him aside. 

Icarus on the floor. He was pale, frostbitten, blue-lipped, his fingers frozen stiff. A small pool of spit had run down to the floor, frozen solid. His eyes were open, but even the moisture on his eyes had turned to ice. Frost coated parts of his clothes and spread outward where he’d fallen, crawling across the metal beneath him. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen before it had the chance to spread.

“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.

“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We stood there, staring for a few seconds before he spoke again. “But the lights are back on, though. Pavo called us up when he noticed that the Wraiths were leaving. You were probably too scared to hear anything, huh?” the captain said, poking me in the arm.

“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”

“That’s what Pavo said,” the captain replied. “But those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to thaw everything out and fix the damage they cause! I hope my baby can make it to the next stop.” 

“God damnit! I thought I was finally making some progress. Sigh. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”

“Yeah,” He bent down and hoisted Icarus over his shoulder. “Can't have my right-hand man be dead on the job! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up and get back to work.”

“Good thing our contracts don't dock our pay for incapacitated crewmates.” I said brushing off some melted ice. “And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge, so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”

“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this? Let alone some of the crap our employers pull?” He sighed. “She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave right now.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive chamber near the cockpit.

“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space, or piss off the higher ups. I need a drink.”

And there you go, just a normal day aboard the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you ask me. I had to ask Pavo about this, since I’d forgotten most of the details. Well, besides how long it took to fix the iced cubed ship for months. But I’m glad he recorded this moment; I was having a hard time picking an entry worth sharing. I’d figured this one was fine to show you what our daily lives are like, aside from the long stretches of nothing and endless repairs. Lesson learned: never buy cheap flashlights. Not worth it when nearly freezing to death on the job. 

Let me know if you guys would like to hear more about our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual routine. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death. But that's all for now, later.",1,1769405707.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1qn7e9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qn7e9c/am_i_overreacting_for_being_disappointed_at_my/,Am I overreacting for being disappointed at my mom after finding out she was still talking my other ex when I was dating my ex?,"First of all, English isn't my first language and I want to apologize for any grammatical mistake.

I (33m)was dating my ex (35f) for 5 years. Let's call her Bee. Bee broke up with me because she was talking to her ex or some other guy I didn't ask for detail. I appreciated her a lot for being honest and saving us a lot of unnecessary drama. She was a good friend and been through a lot with me but I was hurt and would never want to date her again. I told my mom. She likes Bee a lot and always hope it was just a misunderstanding.

After 8 months being single, I then dated my current ex (26f) for 2 years then broke up because ...incompability. Let's call her Boba. Me and Boba hit it off quickly but she turns to be very controlling in the end: jealous of small things, constantly compared me to her ex and friends, broke up with me every week, check my bank account while I slept over, delete her own friend from my social media, etc. I tried to set boundaries but it always came back as my fault. I'm not a perfect neither but I really tried to save the rls. It got to the point of me being really stress that my body start to show signs. I gains 25 lbs and lost all of my muscle. My routine is all messed up. I couldn't sleep and got sick often because Idk when Boba was going to got mad again. She always got mad about something. I was walking on eggshell most of thr time. I know it sounds unhealthy that why I broke it off in the end. During the last fight, I asked her to talk and resolve it peacefully. She cursed at me, she compared me to her ex and went on a Hawaii trip with her friends. That was it for me. She begged me for months which broke my heart. Even though she might be childish, we really clicked and loved being with each other. I even spend 12k for a ring and plan propose her either by our favorite Convict lake.. I ended up selling the ring and bought a watch for myself. The rls ends last April. I still miss her everyday and could not bring myself to date anyone else just yet. Part of me must be unhealthy that I need to work on. Or else why would I still miss her. With that being said, my family isn't fond of Boba. They caught her a couple times drove up to our front door and ""return"" my gifts during our fights. Boba has a habit of ""acting out"" when we fight to get my attention. We know she doesn't mean to end it but that's how she tries to get under my skin. I tried to explain it to them but I can't blame them for having a negative impression towards Boba. I tried to invite her over a few times but Boba said unless my mom asked her to come personally she wouldn't visit. My mom don't oppose Boba to visit but refuse to personally reach out to her. They ended up never see each other again since and distance grow further. Until we broke up.

Fast forward today, Mom told me Dad has already ate and asked if I want to grab lunch with her. I said okay. After finishing our lunch, I took her to a nearby coffee shop before dropping her back home. While standing in line, my mom told me something that stunned me. She said while I was dating Boba, she was still talking to Bee the whole time. She was spilling all the tea about me and Boba. Bee told my mom not to get close to Boba and don't let her visit our home. She asked my mom to give her another chance when Boba and I fight/breakup. I got quiet for the whole trip back. I know Mom has a reason to dislike Boba and the relationship had ended for the better but I can't help but feel bothered by what she shared. I got quiet a whole trip back. My mom constantly appologize for talking to Bee and I said it's okay. She said she has stopped when she heard Bee about to get married from a mutual connection. I guess Bee have never told her that. I don't like that my mom did this behind my back but also Bee was lying to her the whole time. And my mom trusted her because she likes her. I'm upset with Bee for saying that to my mom. I'm upset that mom talked to my ex when I told her not to. Am I overracting for feeling this way? Even though it was already in the past, it's still such a mess. I haven't talk to my mom since. I don't know what to say to her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1qn7dge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Davaoconfessions/comments/1qn7dge/my_girlfriend_of_5_years_cheated_on_me_with_a/,My girlfriend of 5 years cheated on me with a basketball player.,"Hi. I just found out my girlfriend of 5 years cheated on me with a basketball player.

This went on for almost 5 months.

I only found out because I used her phone one time and saw a message from the guy that said:  
“Daya mo one round lang.”

So of course I confronted my girlfriend right away. She said it was a *wrong send*. But honestly… I’m not new to red flags. I’ve been around long enough to know what cheating looks like. (You could say I have a master’s degree in it. lol)

After that, I couldn’t let it go. I checked her phone properly, messages, deleted messages, maps, everything. And yeah… I found out the whole story.

They were meeting up for months. Going on dates, bars, motels… the whole thing.

And what made it worse? The guy is kind of known here. A basketball player in Davao.

But I’m not even jealous of him.

Because based on their conversations, it looked like my ex was paying for everything. Like literally. The dates, the motel, all of it.

There was even a time she asked him to go on a coffee date, and he replied he couldn’t because he didn’t have work and didn’t even have a single penny.

So every time they went out, she paid… using the money I gave her. She even used our car for their dates and let the guy drive it.

While I was at home working my ass off. Paying bills, handling the car expenses, managing our businesses, providing for us, doing everything.

And the crazy part?

Even when I already had screenshots and proof, she still denied it.

I’m sharing this not to get sympathy. I’m sharing this so people are aware of what kind of guy and girl they are.

If you want receipts, just DM me. I can send the screenshots and maps through Google Drive.",1,1769405631.0,Davaoconfessions,3,1.0,False
1qn7cyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qn7cyx/hm_my_gentle_ghost/,[HM] My Gentle Ghost,"Before I officially met the ghost, lights coming on in the middle of the night and paintings falling from my walls had awoken me for nearly a week straight, and my compounding sleepless nights began to show in my work. I feared that I would be laid off of my job if I could not sort out the problems in my home. To make matters slightly worse, my girlfriend, who could confirm I was not dreaming of these events, had just begun staying with me, and she did not want to go back home to stay with her family. So I spoke to my landlord. 



He hung my paintings on the wall with extra firm certainty and secured other fixtures with handy glue, checked the electrical twice over, and reported that the unit he lived in, two floors above mine in the old building, had experienced nothing but nights of blissful darkness, so to please avoid the falling fixtures going forward - which I could never have avoided and he was here to remedy - as the curious sounds and my shuffling about in the night had awoken him more than once.



It was only the night after my landlord's handy work when the sound of smashing plates woke nearly everyone in the building. I regretted having not secured the cupboard doors, as my landlord was now threatening to evict me for the disturbances which I pleaded were not of my account. I asked if perhaps there had been any reported earthquakes, or solar flares or something to that effect; but upon looking into it there were found to be no such accounts.



Out of options, worried that I may soon be homeless, jobless, and possibly without a girlfriend, I discussed the matters over some beers with a good and clever friend. Something I had not considered, he suggested whether I perhaps had a demon.



“A demon,” I said, curiously.

“A demon, yes,” my friend responded, “a spirit, ghost, ghoul, apparition, poltergeist, wraith, incubus, succubus. The devil.”

“Well which one is it?” I asked.

“I’m not sure,” he replied, “I think they’re different words for more or less the same thing. Perhaps you’re dealing with a combination.”

I pondered the suggestion as I sipped my beer, a bit baffled; but I did recall seeing a foggy, humanlike figure in my home at the times of these strange occurrences, but attributed the odd sightings to my being out of sorts in the flickering light, my eyes adjusting to the night as I wiped the sleep from my eyes. “So what should I do, then?” I asked.

“I suppose you could look into an exorcist, or a ghost hunter. Perhaps the local church could advise you.”



Unfortunately I was not a member of the local congregation, but the next day I inquired with the church whether they may have someone that has experience with such matters. I was happy to hear that one of the ministers would hear from me on the matter. So I told him my story, and that very evening he came over to my apartment. 



I prepared for him a ham sandwich and some tea before he got to work. He sat at the kitchen table with my girlfriend and I as he ate. He was a very amiable fellow, but I was quite shy with him. I rarely spent any time around religious folk, and did not know what to say, careful not to offend. He broke any nervous tension by commenting on the fine ham sandwich, and then transitioned the conversation to the matters at hand. He asked whether I had done anything, or had any recent experiences that could have brought about these hauntings.



“Nothing that I can think of,” I told him.

“Many times these spirits are only able to introduce themselves when something of physical importance is disturbed. Sacred land or a prized possession. Or they may be seeking revenge, or simply taking advantage of someone with a weakened mental state,” he clarified, “does anything come to mind?”

“I can’t say I’ve harmed anyone or anything,” I said, thinking over my recent past.

“There was that old table,” my girlfriend recalled.

The minister looked at her studiously.

“There was an old coffee table in our living room. Kept falling over with a rickety leg. Couldn’t be bothered with it anymore,” I said as I slowly came to the realization of its implication. 

“And what happened with this table?” the minister asked.

“I put it out on the curb,” I said, regretting not having more patience with the table and mending it myself, “it’s long gone by now.”

The minister nodded his head solemnly, and then took the final sips of his tea, “show me where this table was, then,” he said, standing from his chair and grabbing his hand bag.



In the living room we showed the minister the new coffee table where the old coffee table had stood. From the minister’s bag he pulled a small crucifix, as well as a bottle of what he told us was holy water, and a bible. He sprinkled water from the bottle onto the crucifix and flicked the water from the crucifix around the room. These actions were then accompanied by the reading of a bible verse, from the gospel of Mark, he told us. From the bible he read loudly and firmly, “And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak new tongues.” We then joined him in putting our hands on the bible as he said a prayer, concluding with amen. The minister finished his night with us by sprinkling the rest of my apartment with holy water while calling on the name of Jesus. He then shook our hands and gave us a warm smile. Bowing his head and putting his palm out, saying that, “no please, it was his pleasure,” he declined my offer to pay him for his services, and kindly told us to not hesitate to reach out if we had any further difficulties. 



To no one’s surprise, that very night, I was awoken by a thud in the living room. Physically and emotionally exhausted, I went to the living room, the lights again flickering. More startling than seeing the coffee table on its side, I was breathless and taken aback at the sight of a ghost, dressed in old fashioned labourers attire of some sort, standing in the living room in waiting. Frozen, wanting to run but unable, wide-eyed, staring at the figure, waiting for something to happen, the ghost put his palms out towards me pacifyingly.



He spoke. “Hi, hi, hello, sorry,” he said, with a gentle smile.

“What the fuck,” I said instinctively,” I took a breath and came back into my body and managed to speak, “listen. I’m sorry about your table, if that’s the problem. I’ll try to have a new one made, just like it.”

“That would be very well,” the ghost said, “but this isn't about that. Well, the table is what allowed me to haunt you. But the minister, it is about him, or anyone else that you might have to try to cast me away. Please, do not do that, do not have him return. I only barely avoided his splashes.”

“But I do not want to be haunted,” I said.

“Yes, of course,” the ghost replied, “I will minimize the hauntings as much as I can. But for my own sake, if you have me cast away, I will be dead again, I will have nothing.”

I took a seat on my sofa, rubbing my tired eyes. “But why must you haunt me at all, why can’t you just be normal like this?” I asked.

“It is not the same. I do not have a living self in the way that you do, so I cannot form personal connections. As the dead, we cannot relate as we did when alive. So that is why we haunt or possess, eliciting strong emotions in our subjects, this creates a bridge to the living. It feels better,” he replied.

“Well I can’t say that I’m able to form personal connections either,” I said, the ghost now looking at me puzzled, “that doesn’t mean I go around tearing people’s houses apart.”

“Rather peculiar,” he said, standing with his hands on his hips, “would you like some help? Perhaps I could help you in some way.”

“No, no, it's fine,” I told him, and invited him to take a seat, and asked if it was ok if I made some tea. He said that would be fine. When I returned I told him that I didn’t think I was the best subject for him. I said that maybe, in the long run, he would benefit from someone that was a bit more connected. The ghost said that everything was seeming up to standard, that I was doing quite well; and so I thanked him, but told him that it may only appear so on the surface.

“So you want to stay then,” I stated.

“Yes, please, I beg you,” the ghost replied, “otherwise I will be sent back to the in-between, it is not so nice there.”

“Are you the devil?” I asked.

“Oh no, no,” he replied assuringly, “we are not affiliated. Just a fellow that used to live in this here building.”

“Ok, well, then, just try not to break any of my stuff, and don’t make any more of a racket in the night; my landlord’s had it, and I have work tomorrow,” I said.

“Yes, of course, I promise,” he replied, “I’ll be the best ghost you could ever ask for.”

I know I might sound weird but I'm having a really-really hard time eating enough protein. 

For context - I'm 35f, 128lb and 5.10"".

I'm aiming to eat at least 100g of protein per day to develop  muscle mass. 

I workout 3-5 times a week and recently started to add weight training to my routine. I've done pilates and barre my entire life and haven't seen much muscle growth, now I realize I have never ate enough protein for that. 

I've become more conscious about it and been trying to add extra protein here and there but I still can't reach 100+ grams per day - all the research shows it's  required for my weight in order to grow muscle 😞 

I'm very picky with food,  pescatarian (don't eat meat because I hate the taste) and really not hungry eating only  3 times a day. I drink a lot of water and coffee. 

Here's what my typical  day looks like:

\- Coffee with half and half 

\- Yogurt with granola  or eggs with  cheese or protein smoothie - 15-20g of protein 

\- Lunch - a bowl with greens, grains, beans, cheese, nuts and sometimes tofu or shrimp - 20-25g of protein 

\- Snack - protein bar or cottage cheese or bowl of edamame  or some cheese and nuts  - 15-20 g of protein 

\- Dinner - fish or shrimp or other seafood and veggies, sometimes with salad with  cheese - 20-25g of protein 

I eat carbs as well because I LOVE carbs and all sweets (very moderate amount), but it's in addition to protein, not instead. Carbs are my joy of life and I don't see any reason to cut them out. 

I need somehow to get extra 25-40g of protein  a day and I have no clue where to get it when with 3 meals and one snack I'm already never hungry....

Can't drink those protein shakes as I really dislike artificial flavors  (my husband loves them, we have a bunch  in the fridge normally -  vanilla, chocolate, strawberry but unfortunately I find the taste disgusting). 

I use unflavored protein for my smoothies, wonder if  putting a scoop  in smth like tea is a good idea? 

Any advice how I can reach my protein goal without  eating  when im not  actually hungry? 

I feel like on eating all the time and still can't meet the goals 😒",8,1769405496.0,nutrition,21,0.9,False

Back in the day when Tinder first came out, there was a shared understanding of the how things were supposed to go. There was a rough scaffolding of social expectation, and while some people did their own thing, most followed a predetermined path. 

It used to be that you would swipe right on people you were interested in, you would have a brief low stakes chat on the app, and if it went well, you would exchange numbers or social media, and continue the conversation there. After some more back and forth, you would then plan an in person meeting, a ""date"" if you will, at a time and place of mutual agreement. Sometimes, these rendezvous were coffee chats, sometimes they were at bars, and other times you were going to some random person's house, and wondering what your parents would think. But there was always the expectation of this progression. 

Nowadays, this script seems to be going by the wayside, and women seemed to treat you the same as if you were approaching them in a bar, despite ostensibly liking you on a dating app.

1qn77nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qn77nq/my_first_post/,My First Post,"I just found this sub, my husband is out of town for work and I can't sleep. My mind tends to go nuts with bad thoughts and memories whenever I'm alone to think about them, mainly at night. So I hope it's okay that I vent but also introduce myself lol. 

I'm a 38f, married and have 2 children. I went NC for good with my mother in 2015. What's ironic is for the first few years of my life, I was a mommy's girl. Even though I do have some good memories, my childhood home life was very tumultuous. My mother yelled A LOT. She knew how to put on an act when adults were over, but she got so comfortable yelling that she didn't care if other kids were over. It made me afraid to invite friends over because I would've been humiliated if she flipped out while any of them were over. If she was in a bad mood, the whole house felt it. It was like walking on eggshells. 

I have an older 1/2 brother, older sister {whom I found out in high school we're actually 1/2 sisters as well}, and 2 younger sisters. When one of my younger sisters went to kindergarten, my mom decided she wanted another baby {she was 40 at the time}. I had no idea she was wanting another one until one day after school she tells us she's pregnant. During the pregnancy, when she'd be in one of her moods, she'd point to her belly and say ""Do you want me to lose this baby??"" implying we were stressing her out by fighting or typical kid stuff that bugged her. Even though my sister was just an infant at the time, I started noticing weird behavior from my mom. We had gotten internet with AOL and my aunt got her into eBay then Classmates.com. She got so addicted that she would literally spend all day online. She was trying to be sneaky from my dad, so she'd log on in the morning when he showered, make his coffee and send him off to work, watch him drive away then she'd get back on. It was nonstop. But then when my dad would say he was coming home, she'd bark orders at us and create the illusion that she was busy all day even though it was us kids cleaning. I promised myself at that young age {it started when I was 12} that I would never serve my someday kids cereal for dinner, because I had it for a month when she stopped cooking dinner and would say ""There's cereal"" if I asked what was for dinner. My older sister and I then caught on that she was having online affairs with other men. My dad even paid for a flight for her to go see a ""friend from high school"" she found on Classmates. Then when she would want to see men in other states, she'd claim that same friend had a beach house there. I confided in my aunt {my mom's sister} that I knew what was going on. She ratted me out while my mother was visiting her, so my mother calls the house and tells me ""If you tell your dad, I will make your life a living hell."" A lot of psychological abuse came with her cheating ways, including gaslighting me and calling me a liar. As an adult, she and I had multiple bouts of not talking. In 2012, we hadn't been talking for months. Then I learned she'd been diagnosed with cancer. I felt guilty and wanted to have things be okay with us. She got treatment and has been in remission for years. I thought for sure cancer would change her outlook on how she treats her kids. Nope. When I was pregnant with my son, she went off on me in a text because I wouldn't let her announce my pregnancy on her Facebook and said I wasn't caring about her feelings. I had a c-section and literally as I was being rolled down the hospital hallway to recovery, she was asking if she could post photos of him. 

The final straw was...a year and a half prior I was going through something and confided in her when I felt like I couldn't with anyone else. I would be crying on the phone with her and before we'd hang up, I would make her swear not to share what I told her with anyone and even specified a couple of people. She swore she wouldn't. So, year and a half later I'm talking with one of my cousins on the phone and she brings it up in conversation. I was stunned and asked her how she knew. I think I even hung up on her to be able to call my mother right away to confront her about it. She wouldn't answer and texted back that she was out with her bf. I tell her it wasn't something I wanted to discuss over text and to call me when she got home. Word must travel fast because not long after that she said ""I know what this is about. I'm not going to let you cuss at me and berate me so no I won't be calling. Your aunt and I are sisters and we talk about our kids. And I will NEVER apologize for it."" My aunt is one of the people I specifically said not to tell because she has a big mouth and loves to gossip. And that's how my cousin found out. So I told my mother I was done with her. First thing she did was call up my younger sister and say ""She's gonna keep that baby from me!"" And when she was realizing I was serious, she would say things like ""I'm sorry. What do you want me to say?? Sisters talk about their kids. It's what sisters do. It wasn't malicious. I was worried about you. You're really going to punish me over this??"" I was done and I meant it. ",4,1769405126.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

And what I found? Most advice about talking to women is either patronizing garbage or creepy pickup artist nonsense. The truth is simpler and way more interesting.

Here's what nobody tells you: Most guys struggle with conversations because they're performing instead of connecting. They're so busy trying to say the ""right thing"" that they forget to be an actual human. And women? They can smell that anxiety from a mile away. Not because they're psychic, but because we're all wired to detect authenticity. It's evolutionary biology mixed with social conditioning.

The good news? Once you understand how conversation actually works (not how you think it works), everything gets easier. Let me break it down.

 Step 1: Kill the Interview Mode

You know what sucks? When a conversation feels like a job interview. ""Where are you from? What do you do? Do you have siblings?"" Boom, boom, boom. Questions with no substance, no follow up, no actual curiosity.

**Here's what works:** Ask questions that reveal something interesting. Instead of ""What do you do?"" try ""What's something you're working on that you're excited about?"" or ""What's been taking up most of your mental space lately?""

The difference? The first question gets a one word answer. The second one opens doors. You're giving her permission to talk about what actually matters to her, not just recite her LinkedIn profile.

And listen, really listen. Don't just wait for your turn to talk. Author Celeste Headlee's book *We Need to Talk* breaks this down perfectly. She spent years interviewing people as an NPR host and found that the best conversations happen when you genuinely want to know the answer, not when you're stockpiling your next witty comment.

 Step 2: Share, Don't Perform

Authenticity beats entertainment every single time. You don't need to be the funniest guy in the room. You just need to be real. Share actual thoughts, not rehearsed lines.

**Bad:** ""So I'm kind of a Netflix expert, haha.""  
**Better:** ""I've been weirdly obsessed with documentaries about cults lately. It's like watching a psychological trainwreck you can't look away from.""

See the difference? The second one has personality. It's specific. It invites conversation. And if she's into it, boom, you've got something to explore together. If not? That's fine too. Move on to something else.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability (check out *Daring Greatly* if you want your mind blown) shows that people connect over realness, not perfection. When you share something genuine, even if it's awkward, you give the other person permission to do the same. That's where actual connection lives.

 Step 3: Master the Art of Noticing

Women drop hints constantly. Not in some cryptic, decode the matrix way. Just normal human communication cues. She mentions she loves cooking? Don't just nod and move on. Ask what she made recently. Ask what got her into it. Ask if she's the kind of person who follows recipes or wings it.

**This is called active engagement.** You're building on what she's giving you instead of waiting to insert your own topic.

Psychologist John Gottman (the guy who can predict divorce with scary accuracy) found that successful relationships are built on people who ""turn toward"" each other's bids for attention. Same applies to conversations. When someone shares something, they're testing if you care. Show them you do.

 Step 4: Stop Trying to Fix Things

Here's a mistake almost every guy makes: A woman shares a problem or frustration, and you immediately jump into solution mode. ""Oh, you should just..."" or ""Have you tried...?""

**Stop.** Just stop.

Most of the time, people aren't looking for solutions. They're looking for empathy, validation, or just someone to listen. That doesn't mean you can't offer advice, but lead with understanding first.

Try: ""That sounds frustrating"" or ""Yeah, I can see why that would suck."" Let her vent. If she wants your input, she'll ask. This isn't about being passive. It's about recognizing what someone actually needs in the moment.

The app Ash (it's like having a relationship coach in your pocket) has tons of micro lessons on this exact dynamic. Super helpful for building emotional intelligence without feeling like you're in therapy.

 Step 5: Get Comfortable With Silence

Silence freaks people out. We feel this pressure to fill every gap with words. But silence isn't the enemy. Awkward rambling is.

**Good conversations breathe.** They have pauses. Moments where both people are just thinking or enjoying the vibe. Don't panic and word vomit to fill the space.

If there's a natural lull, that's fine. Smile. Look around. Make an observation about something nearby. Or just own it: ""My brain just went blank for a second there."" Humor and honesty beat nervous chatter.

 Step 6: Ditch the Agenda

The fastest way to kill a conversation is walking into it with an agenda. If you're only talking to her because you want something (a date, validation, whatever), she's going to feel it. And it's going to feel gross.

**Approach conversations with genuine curiosity.** Not every interaction needs to lead somewhere. Sometimes, it's just cool to meet someone interesting and have a good chat. That's it. No pressure, no weird expectations.

When you remove the outcome obsession, you relax. And when you relax, you're way more fun to talk to. It's a self fulfilling cycle.

 Step 7: Learn to Tell Stories (Not Monologues)

There's a difference between sharing a story and hijacking the conversation. Good stories are short, have a point, and invite reaction. Bad stories are long, meandering, and make the other person check out mentally.

**Structure matters.** Set up the context quickly, get to the interesting part, land it with a punchline or insight, and pass the ball back to her.

Example: ""I went hiking last weekend and got completely lost. Had to use moss on trees to figure out which way was north like some budget Bear Grylls. Have you ever been that level of unprepared for something?""

Short. Relatable. Gives her an easy way to jump in.

Matthew Dicks' book *Storyworthy* is incredible for this. He teaches how to find the moments in your life worth sharing and how to tell them without boring people to death. Seriously good stuff.

 Step 8: Match Energy, Don't Force It

If she's chill and low key, don't come in with high energy chaos. If she's animated and excited, don't be a monotone robot. **Mirroring is real.** It's how humans build rapport subconsciously.

This doesn't mean being fake. It means being socially aware. Pay attention to her tone, pace, body language, and adjust naturally. You're creating a rhythm together, not performing a solo act.

 Step 9: Know When to Exit

Not every conversation is going to click. And that's fine. If it's not flowing, don't force it. Politely wrap it up and move on with your life.

""It was nice talking to you. Catch you later."" Done. No drama, no weird explanations. Just a clean exit.

Knowing when to let go is just as important as knowing how to engage. You can't connect with everyone, and trying to is exhausting.

 Step 10: Practice Like Your Life Depends on It

You don't get good at conversation by reading about it. You get good by doing it. A lot. Talk to strangers. Talk to cashiers. Talk to people at coffee shops, bars, the gym, wherever. The more reps you get, the less you overthink it.

The app Finch is great for building social habits and tracking progress. It gamifies self improvement in a way that doesn't feel preachy. Plus, it's low key adorable.

For anyone serious about leveling up their social skills long term, there's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia that pulls from relationship psychology experts, communication research, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can set a goal like ""improve conversation skills with women"" and it generates a personalized learning plan, complete with audio lessons you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, anywhere from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. It's been solid for connecting the dots between all this advice and actually internalizing it.

Conversations aren't this mystical art form. They're a skill. And like any skill, you get better with practice, feedback, and a willingness to screw up sometimes. So get out there. Be curious. Be real. And stop treating women like they're a different species. They're just people trying to have a good time, same as you.

Was seeing him a hello or a goodbye? 24F and 24M,"I’m (24 F) trying to get some perspective on a long, confusing almost-relationship that recently resurfaced and left me more emotionally affected than I expected.

**How we met**:

I met “Will” (24 M) last March at a mutual friend’s party literally four days after I’d ended a long-term relationship. Turns out he worked in my uni building so we ran into each other a lot. He was very keen early on and asked me out repeatedly over the next 3 months (easily 15+ times).

I said no each time for two main reasons:

	1.	The timing felt wrong: I was freshly single and clearly not settled.

	2.	I was concerned about his drinking. He had a DUI, and it was obvious alcohol played a big role in his life.

Despite that, we stayed friendly and around each other socially until losing contact when the semester ended in June.

**What changed**:

In October, things shifted. Around this time, another girl (“Harriet”) entered the picture: someone he met after me. She was very hot-and-cold, didn’t know what she wanted, and put him on a pretty intense emotional rollercoaster which resulted in her going to China on a meditation retreat leaving him pretty cut and dry. 

The day after she left for China, he and I ended up hooking up (I had no idea she existed at the time) and in the month after slipping into what felt like a “fake relationship” for about a month. It wasn’t official, but it was close: lots of time together, deep conversations, calls every other day, him messaging if I was on campus and wanted to catch up, buying me dinner, coffee and drinks, driving me home, and most of all, comfort. I finally let my guard down after we hooked up again at the end of that month and caught real feelings.

The painful part is that a days after we hooked up again, as she was about to come back (unbeknownst to me) I confessed my feeling and he chose her. After that, things became awkward and unresolved because he worked in the same building . We avoided each other for ages: strained hellos, eye contact without speaking, tension whenever we crossed paths. I was convinced he hated me and blocked my number (I messaged him once about something broken as he works in facilities). 

**Fast forward to Saturday:**

I ran into him at a house party. He stared at me when I arrived, and after an hour or two of avoiding each other, we ended up talking. We had a long, honest, emotional catch-up. Turns out he never hated me, or blocked me and things didn’t work out with Harriet. 

He opened up about things he hadn’t told others: including admitting he’s an alcoholic and is actively trying to get help. When I told him about a recent sexual assault I experienced from a close friend he knew a lot about, he took me aside so we could talk privately and comforted me.

Later, he asked me to come for a walk. We talked, laughed, reminisced, and ended up kissing. It felt hot, urgent and familiar, like he missed me and knew it was our last night together. When things started getting more physical, I stopped it and explained I wasn’t ready after what I’d been through and he fully respected that.

I also made it clear that I’m moving cities next week (he’s known this for months) and that realistically, “in another life maybe, but not this one.” He acknowledged that and held me. 

**The confusing part:**

At the end of the night, he attempted an Irish goodbye (apparently his default when emotions get hard). I chased him down to say goodbye properly, we hugged and kissed, and wished each other well. Since then, contact has been minimal and awkward again. The mutual friend we met through tells me I’m better off without but he makes me so happy I can’t express it: I really could love him if I had the chance.

Now I can’t stop thinking about it, not because I think we should be together, but because it felt like something real resurfaced and then vanished again.

**My questions**:

Do you think I should see him before I leave? 

Do you think he genuinely cared about me, or was I just emotional timing / a safe place when someone else was unavailable?

Would someone open up that deeply (especially about addiction) if it didn’t mean something?

I know we’re not right for each other: I’m moving 9 hours drive away in 5 days, and I’m not planning to chase him. But I’d really appreciate outside perspectives from people who aren’t emotionally involved.",1,1769404736.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I Sharpened everything.,"I spent this snowstorm visiting my parents. I gifted my mother a 210mm Aogami Super clad in stainless a few years back, and she uses it every day. I noticed that she let the patina get a little out of hand, the core steel was pitting and the cladding was starting to flake. A little bit of Flitz and a fine rust eraser later and the fire is put out. The core steel has a decent amount of pitting still, and now has a matte finish. I also took this opportunity to sharpen... all of her knives. It's been a long storm. The three Zwillings were such a pleasure to sharpen, and now they are now atom splitters. I had a little bit of trouble with the custom damascus skinning looking knife. I think the curvature of the drop point was just not vibing with all my practice on chefs knives and Japanese knives. That and it's ungodly thick. I'm going to give it another shot with my Xarilk fixed angle sharpener another day, as it really has more of a pocket knife shape. I give myself a 7/10 on that one.

After polishing some of the rust off of the damascus chonker I noticed some of the contrast was diminished. There is pitting too, but I can only do so much. I figured this would be an awesome time to mess around with acid etching. I have no idea where to get ferric chloride during a blizzard, but I have a big 'ole bag of ground coffee.

I boiled a mega strength pot of coffee on the stove, found the biggest cup in the house, and dunked away. Also a good time to set a patina on the Flitzed Gyuto, and I happened to have my recently thinning project Kurogane on me so why not add that too. And a random hunting knife... and a fully stainless damascus nakiri. I also drank a cup of coffee, and had some coffee ice cream. The walls are vibrating.

I left the project Kurogane in the coffee for 3 hours and it came out interesting. The coffee definitely ate some of the kurochi finish and the painted on makers mark. It also turned the kurochi blue? Some chemical colors on the core steel, and some darkening of my poor mans kasumi. Appears to also be some tainted marks from the beef I cut earlier today.

Above it's shown next to the twin Kurogane bunka in factory condition. I didn't really expect this result. The pitted Aogami Super behaved more normally, putting a blue patina on the core before turning dark grey.

The stainless Nakiri, to no ones surprise, did nothing at all.

The damascus chonker and hunting knife are going to dip overnight as the contrast on those is looking awesome and I want more. I'll show you later.

This experiment leaves me with a few questions

1. I wasn't aware acid etching ate away kurochi. I have some ferric chloride on order to continue etching experiments, but if I dip the project knife any longer I'm thinking I'm going to have a kurochless knife. I have cutting board wax... or maybe electrical tape? Or just let it ride?

2. Can you actually acid etch a stainless damascus knife? I tried googling, but apparantly saying stainless damascus just leads to results of stainless mixed with carbon. I'm pretty sure this guy is fully stainless. Cause it was the only knife in that house that didn't have rust.

1qn7288,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1qn7288/why_knk_will_never_become_a_church_street/,Why KNK will never become a church street,"KNK looks great now. But aesthetics alone will not make it a Church Street

With the recent TN government renovation, KNK Road finally looks good. Wider footpaths, better lighting, cleaner visuals. Credit where it is due, this is a big upgrade from what the road used to be.

But despite how nice it looks today, KNK will still never become a Church Street. Not because the renovation failed, but because the deeper conditions that make Church Street work simply do not exist in Chennai.

The first point is disposable income and spending behaviour. Church Street thrives because Bengaluru has a large population of young people with high disposable incomes who are comfortable spending casually and frequently. People show up without a plan, walk around, eat, drink, browse, and spend money impulsively. That kind of behaviour sustains high footfall streets. Bengaluru attracts top talent from across the country. Chennai on the other hand is seeing brain drain wrt to higher paying tech jobs. 

The second and biggest constraint is Tamil Nadu’s alcohol policy.

You simply cannot build a true high street without a night economy. Church Street works because cafés, pubs, breweries, standup shows, and late night food exist together in dense clusters. Alcohol anchors nighttime footfall.

In Tamil Nadu, restrictive licensing, TASMAC dominance, and moral scrutiny make this almost impossible. Without alcohol led spaces, streets shut down early. Coffee and dessert alone cannot keep the street attractive to all kinds of youth.

Third is general conservative public culture.

Church Street is messy and loud by design. People loiter, hang around without purpose, perform, protest, laugh loudly, and occupy space freely. Bengaluru tolerates this chaos.

Chennai's different. Public lingering attracts stares. KNK sits amid residential areas they may complain and not accept the behavioural spillover needed for a vibrant high street.

Even after renovation, KNK is still a road first, public space second with vehicles moving through it. It looks better, but the same vibe may not be constructed.

Church Street evolved over decades through bookstores, student culture, cheap food, music, etc. KNK’s transformation is aesthetic first and top down.

This does not mean the renovation is pointless. KNK can become a calm, upscale boulevard for cafés, boutiques, and evening walks. That is a perfectly valid outcome.

But expecting it to become Chennai’s Church Street misunderstands what actually makes Church Street work.

P.S.
To everyone asking why I'm comparing it to Church Street, just check social media. Seriously, every page and influencer is doing it. I'm not just making this comparison up; I'm just joining the conversation that's already happening.",50,1769404660.0,Chennai,33,0.84,False

\- An actual progression system 

\- Proximity markers

\- The quality of how the cars sound

\- Forza aero that might actually look good

\- High contrast adjustments (I have moderate colorblindness and the accessibility adjustments for it in FH5 aren't quite good enough to compensate a lot of times) 

\- Cars and coffee that actually looks interesting

\- The world actually looks 'alive'

The things I'm not sure about are the rearview mirror, if they fixed the smoke screening from people using full driving aids in normal online racing, if they got rid of all the dead space in the map, and if they steered away from the participation trophy vibe that FH5 has. But even if those things aren't fixed, FH6 still looks like a overall massive upgrade from FH5.

As a note, I think they're doing the exact thing I had said they should do to capitalize on FM being a dead franchise - incorporate parts of FM into FH6. The facts that the remaining team for Motorsport was moved to help with FH6 and that this game has a progression system *and* proximity markers reinforces that theory imo.

The bottom line is, FH6 is looking to be almost exactly the game I hoped it would be. I know I'll be late to the party since I'm on PS5 but I'm pre-ordering it anyway. ",8,1769404617.0,ForzaHorizon,0,0.79,False

They get up together and share silence

As they watch the news and sip their coffee

Everything, I’ve somehow out grown

I can’t find anything that fits just right 

I’ve got this hunger in me 

All this restless energy 

I cannot seem to satiate

Cause there’s this ghost of a little girl the thin walls

Her small voice echoes through the halls

It was published in 1992.



This is one of those novelty books. Remember back when I was reading those? I had the itch again and went looking for a new one. This book jumped out at me, and I ordered myself a copy.



The idea here is that Jack (the one from ""Jack and the Beanstalk"") decides to write stupid versions of old fairy tales. The problem is that the book is coming into existence live right in your hands, all the characters are self-aware that they are in a book, and the stories themselves are really terrible... on purpose. Reading this book is like experiencing a train wreck. It all happens at one time, and there is no way to really stop it from happening.



For example, in ""Chicken Licken,"" it isn't the sky that's falling; it's the table of contents that is falling down on top of everyone. Another example is ""The Really Ugly Duckling,"" which is about a duck who is actually an ugly duck. That's it. He's just really ugly and isn't a swan. It's stupid.



The titular character The Stinky Cheese Man was actually a take on ""The Gingerbread Man."" The main difference here was that he was so stinky, nobody wanted to chase him... so he was just running away for nothing.



Characters in this book are so aware that this is all happening that they often protest that they have to be there at all. Jack is constantly trying to round them up and get them to do what he wants them to do. Sometimes they cooperate, and other times they revolt. The Giant in particular will flat-out not listen, but that makes sense since he is Jack's main antagonist.



All in all, this book is a complete disaster, but it is also really funny. I was impressed with how it utterly destroys the fourth wall. It's also a quick read, being there are only fifty pages and most of them are pictures... or just blank pages that the characters might complain about. It's all over the place.



Either way, I do recommend the book. It's pretty easy to find and would probably make a good book for your coffee table. Check this one out.

Woke up at 5am because I am sleeping poorly at the minute. 

(Meds, menopause, night sweats who even cares anymore🤪 or maybe that the Nest hearing thing thinks my house is 21 degrees, only in my bed just in the other side of the wall it is 11 degrees but Nest disagrees and won't turn on. 

Wonder into the bathroom for a pee where I am suddenly flooded in bright white airport light because my husband decided a mirror with auto sensing lights would be clever. Yeah in a sort of 'caught breaking and entering' kind of way... 

After waving my hand at it for several minutes causing it to break out into disco setting, I finally get it turned off, but my hand moving away makes it turn on again... we do that for a while longer. 

Finally when I've managed to turn it off I can go to the loo... except I can now see the outline of the mirror burnt into my retina.

I am more awake now than I'd like to be so I stumble into the living room where the standby TV decides that 'small movements in the floor' equals 'turn on'. Another bright light floods the room for no reason and I must abandon what I am doing to go turn it off. Sometimes this Samsung TV takes this as an invitation to just straight up turn on its own channel at full volume. 

Back to making coffee. The kettle needs a button pushed 3 times (as opposed to once) to set to boil. It does this at an enormous volume whilst a digi delay shows me the rising temperature of the water in bright green numbers. Once finished it beeps loudly like a hungry baby bird screaming for its mother. 

Put on a pot of porridge. Induction nightmare piece of equipment. (I used to have fire, gas, but no we are not allowed anymore. We must suffer the black beeping angry plate) 

The auto fan immediately turns itself on setting 2 dots (this just means louder) 

When you turn it off (if you can find the magic place on the big black surface and touch it just right with NOT wet fingers!!) the main fan turns on automatically so you then have to press that invisible button three times to get back to 'off'. This happens with quite a delay so you almost always press past that option and start again. Sigh.

I know the good old days had its not good bits but weren't some things just totally fine as they were? 

And is just the stuff I am forced to interact with a soon as I wake up...just yesterday I had countless frustrating encounters with shit that thinks it's smart. 

I googled something about periods, hormones and pre puberty. 

Google AI told me that for girls between the ages of 6-10 periods can cause blah blah (it simply did not understand the word 'PRE-puberty' and only gave me answers about puberty) 

My husband bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner... yeah it can get dust from across the road with its jet engine... but you just can't hold on to the handle because it has the diameter of a football and it's like they actually forgot to make a place to hold it? When you pull your arm back it tips over... as opposed to just rolling back and forth. What exactly are these engineers at Dyson doing!? Smack!!? 

My old washing machine had one dial and one button. The new one has a digi display with multiple pop up window warnings or info I do t want that needs to be closed before I can choose from 15 different washing cycles with interesting names but I actually just want to be able to choose a temperature. Oh the wash cycle you have chosen does not come in '40degree' option only 50, 60 and 20... wtf. 

I have to press through so many menus, beeps at every push, for way too long to even be able to push start. I want an on off button ok!! Thats it! 

Sigh. Sigh. sigh. 

I am so tired of 'tech advancements' because they are not advanced. They are just more time consuming, more complicated, more more more but in reality less. 

They're everywhere. They almost always do a terrible job of the thing they're actually designed for...they have no consideration for whether the item cost 10 monies or hundreds. They are all the same. 

This is such an 'old lady' complaint but I feel these days my home has been invaded, taken over and ruined by this sh\*\* 

Death to standby lights! 

I wanna go back to fire. Long wave radio. Knobs and dials. On off switches. 

Thanks for reading. 

I just... all this progress is actually setbacks. Everything works less well and disturbs my simple basic needs such as rest and sleep and peace and quiet. And they're not even obeying.

Appearance: 4’9 to 5’1, White looking, Thick Eyebrows, Round face. Says she is from Chandigarh and is visiting Pune for her Sister’s Delivery. (The story can change, but note down the appearance). 

She calls me and says if we can meet. I was in the area y’day and decided to ‘explore’ as I was not having any plans either. Also, I was not looking to get laid down, so why not for a coffee. 

I knew something was fishy, because, I am old (34) and she said she was 26. While it was not instantly fishy-fishy, as I have been called Daddy before, but then something did not felt ok. 

I decided to anyway drive up to the location which was 45 Main Street in Pimple Saudagar. This building has 3 storey. Skoda showroom in the ground, 3-Idiots cafee at 2nd and Vault at 3rd floor. 

I reached there on time, she took another 20 mins to reach. After arriving she wasn’t expecting me to be what I was looking yesterday. 

Fortunately (or unfortunately for her) I was in my khaki pant, white shirt, two mobile phones in hand and a brown-burgandy shoes. And then, I pulled over in my SUV. 

As soon as I meet her, I started to feel something off, but it was not me, it was her. My appearance made her think the target was no-easy, she was distracted and she was nervous. I picked the nerve. 

Me: So where do you wanna have coffee? 

She: Uper chalte hai (clearly doesn’t specify if it is 3-Idiot coffee or Vault). 

Me: Okay. (Red flag). 

She gets a call; She answers: “Haan me mere friend se milne ayi hun caffee me bas ab uper jaa rahe hai” 

We head to the lift. 

Me: 3-idiots? I think they will have good coffee. It was 4:30pm so I wasn’t expecting to have food. 

She: Nai uper hi chalte hai. (Gently push to go to Vault). 

Me: Okay, let’s go. We reach there, the bar looks shady to me. Most of them are, so no wonder. I wasn’t judging the bar, I was noting down signals from this girl. 

In the lift, I asked her: what she is doing. She goes on Pause, blank. 

Then I purposfully said this: I went to Mantralay in Mumbai - Ek file dene thi, toh waha se aaj ate ate late ho gaya. (Sets tone that if she fucks up, she finds out). 

She is all distracted. I speak with the guy in all marathi, I generally speak whichever langauge they are comfortable but this bar (may be) and this girl was all red flag for me. 

The guy arranges the table and then this girl, sits down. 

The first thing she does is she starts asking me: 

She: So ap kya lenge. Now without a conversation if she asks me kya lenge it was clear she was trying to trap me. Generally when you meet someone, they ask after sitting about how is the place, and even if you are meeting someone stranger consent and comfort is important so girls (genuine) do ask, is this place ok for you, or I also take the courtesy to ask). This girl was straight into : Ap kya lenge. 

Me: I told her I had my lunch so something light. 🤨

She: Can we start with some light drinks? 🤡 Aaj weekend hai toh I generally get thoda saa (Red flag!) 

Me; I looked straight in her eyes and said, Look I don’t drink but I don’t mind if you want to, you will have to pay for yourself. 🤪 

She: Ap kyo nai peete? 🤡

Me: I just don’t. (Sakhta Launda). 

She; her face starts to get red and she is getting angry and agitated seen on her face (probably thinking ki she wasted her 50 rs on Auto) 🤡

She: Hmm ok, toh ap kuch toh lete honge naa. 

Me: I just had my lunch. So I am not hungry. Plus this place is not my choice. Where did you find it. 

She: Mene google kiya tha so isliye yaha aye. 

She: Pushes to get Moctails. Ap mocktail toh lelo. 

Me: Nahi aaj mood nahi hai. And I wanted a coffee bass, kahi aur chale? 

She: Couldn’t insist anything on me, she decided to give up. 

As we hit ground floor, I was waiting to get my car and was seeing how I could get to the parking, in the interim I heard she calls her friend “woh nahi hua aaj banda maan hi nai raha tha….” 

My gut feelings confirmed, knew it was trap. So i started to push her now. I said, Chalo Third Wave chalte hai. She says, mujhe nai pata woh kya hota hai. 

Then she says; Mujhe na actually jana hai, ok bye. 🤧🤣

Me: Ok.

Some red flags to connect the dots.

1. Understand intent. No harm in randomly meeting anyone just don’t meet while thinking through your dick

2. See if the first meet is set at a high super expensive bar 

3. Understand and set the ground of who pays 

4. Be prepared with your plan-b. Assume that you are going to get trapped. 

5. Put second-order thinking to work. If she says this, what your safe answer should be etc. 

6. Speak with Servers and try to gauge and analyse the place. 

7. Stay safe and vigilant. ",12,1769403888.0,Hinjewadi,3,1.0,False

The mind paralyzed by failure,

fearful of the adversary afoot.

The mountain…

My doubts, necromanced—

smirking through the voices

Reminded of my past versions,

frozen…

screams preserved in ice.

But the longer I wait,

the colder it gets—

burdened by the truth

Then courage erupts,

provoked—enraged

I have lost around 20kgs of weight, I would just walk 1.5 hours daily. Few months back, I started running on treadmill and it was much easier than before and I felt good. So I have been running on treadmill once or twice a week, and I stopped after I could easily do it for 1 hour at 8 kmph speed, as people also want to use those machines and started giving stares. So I have started running on road for a week and have bunch of questions about it.   
  
Here's my 3 runs for the week:  
1.  Wednesday - 5.33 Km - 43:49   
2.  Friday - 7.08 Km - 1:04:38  
3. Monday - 10.2 Km - 1:23:58

First, I wanted to ask if I do these 3 runs every week, would I be able to build enough strength and endurance to do HM and FM? For now, I am just focusing on increasing distance and not speed. But would short durations of sprint help me or I can risk injury? I already feel slight discomfort on my knees (very slight!).

How do I prepare for my morning runs? like should I eat at night before bed or 30 minutes before run. Since im also in calorie deficit, I dont want to eat too high calorie foods, I just want something that can give me enery quick enough for the run. For now, Im just taking protein shake with oats and coffee. But I think it just takes time to digest and I dont feel the energy during the run.

Since I train 6 days a week, PPL routine in evening, how do I structure my runs, so im giving my legs enough rest and not overtrain them. Also some excercises and routines so I dont injure my shin or calves.

Lastly, any tips on how to control breathing, in my previous runs, I just try to keep my mouth shut to not breathe from mouth. but my breathing is irregular and I feel that costs me some more kms. 

I understand that I could have asked Chatgpt, but I wanted a human response, to learn from someone who has climbed the same steps as me. Any other advice would be much appreciated, Thanks!",3,1769403634.0,indianrunners,0,0.81,False
1qn6pi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qn6pi1/how_to_watch_klowdtv_online_with_a_vpn/,How to Watch KlowdTV Online with a VPN,"Ever tried watching your favorite news channel while traveling abroad, only to hit a wall saying ""Content not available in your region""? Frustrating doesn't even begin to cover it. You're paying for the service, but geography decides whether you can actually watch it.

That's exactly what happens with KlowdTV when you're outside the US. The streaming platform checks your IP address, sees you're not in America, and blocks access. But here's the thing—there's a simple way around this.

✅ **Quick Answer:** Use a VPN to watch KlowdTV from anywhere. Connect to a US server through NordVPN (or similar service), and the platform thinks you're browsing from America. Takes about 5 minutes to set up, works on all devices, and you'll be streaming within minutes.

# What Is KlowdTV and Why Can't I Access It?

KlowdTV is a live TV streaming service owned by Herring Networks Inc—the same company behind One America News Network (OAN). The platform offers **68 free channels** plus premium tiers ranging from $2.50 to $9.99 monthly.

The channel lineup leans heavily conservative (OAN, Newsmax, InfoWars, The First, Daily Wire), but it's not exclusively political. You'll also find:

* **Entertainment:** Sony Movie Channel, AWE
* **Lifestyle:** Nautical Channel, QVC
* **News:** EuroNews (international perspective)
* **Sports:** Various niche sports channels

So why the geo-block? **Licensing agreements.** Content providers negotiate broadcast rights by region. KlowdTV's agreements restrict streaming to US IP addresses. When you connect from the UK, Canada, or anywhere outside America, the platform detects your location through your IP address and blocks access.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Some users report that KlowdTV's ""Worldwide Plan"" ($4.99/month) *should* work internationally for OAN access specifically. But in practice? Results vary wildly, and the broader channel lineup stays locked behind US-only restrictions.

# How a VPN Bypasses KlowdTV's Geo-Restrictions

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) changes your virtual location by routing your internet traffic through a server in another country. Here's how it works for streaming:

**Without VPN:** Your Device → ISP → KlowdTV detects non-US IP → Access Denied

**With VPN:** Your Device → VPN Server (US) → KlowdTV sees US IP → Access Granted

The beauty of this setup? KlowdTV has no way to determine your actual physical location. It only sees the IP address of the VPN server—which appears to be in Los Angeles, New York, or wherever you've connected.

But not all VPNs work equally well for streaming. After testing 15+ services with KlowdTV, I can tell you speed matters as much as location spoofing. A slow VPN turns HD streaming into a buffering nightmare.

# Step-by-Step: How to Watch KlowdTV with a VPN

Let's walk through the exact process. I'm using NordVPN as the example because it's what I've found most reliable for streaming, but the steps work similarly with other quality VPNs.

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN

You need a service with:

* **Fast US servers** (for HD/720p streaming)
* **Strong encryption** (keeps your connection private)
* **No bandwidth caps** (unlimited streaming)
* **Multiple device support** (watch on TV, phone, tablet)

Based on months of testing, **NordVPN** checks all these boxes. It averaged **779 Mbps** in speed tests—way more than the 15 Mbps you need for HD streaming on KlowdTV.

🔒 **Security Note:** Free VPNs rarely work for streaming. They're slow, often blocked by platforms like KlowdTV, and some even sell your browsing data. If privacy matters (and it should), spend the few bucks monthly for a reputable service.

# Step 2: Download and Install the VPN

1. Sign up for your chosen VPN (NordVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee)
2. Download the app for your device:
   * **Desktop:** Windows, Mac, Linux
   * **Mobile:** iOS, Android
   * **TV:** Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Smart TVs
3. Install and log in with your credentials

The whole process takes maybe 5 minutes. NordVPN's apps are dead simple—even if you've never used a VPN before, you'll figure it out.

# Step 3: Connect to a US Server

Open the VPN app and select a **United States server**. Most VPNs let you pick specific cities. For KlowdTV, it doesn't really matter which US location you choose—I've had success with:

* **New York** (East Coast, fast for most users)
* **Los Angeles** (West Coast, great if you're in Asia/Pacific)
* **Chicago** (Central, solid middle-ground option)

Click connect. Within seconds, your IP address changes to a US-based one.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** Servers geographically closer to you usually offer better speeds. If you're in Europe, East Coast US servers (New York, Miami) typically perform better than West Coast ones.

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cookies (Important!)

Before accessing KlowdTV, clear your browser's cookies and cache. Why? KlowdTV might've already stored your real location data from previous visits.

**Chrome/Edge/Firefox:**

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select ""Cookies and other site data""
3. Click ""Clear data""

This step takes 10 seconds and prevents weird access errors.

# Step 5: Access KlowdTV and Start Streaming

1. Go to **klowdtv.com** or open the KlowdTV app on your device
2. Log in with your existing account (or create a free one)
3. Start watching—the platform sees your US IP and grants full access

That's it. You're now streaming KlowdTV as if you were sitting in Kansas.

If you're using a **TV device** (Roku, Fire TV Stick), install the VPN on your router or use a VPN that supports direct installation on streaming devices. NordVPN has native apps for Fire TV and Android TV, making this painless.

# Best VPNs for Streaming KlowdTV in 2025

After extensive testing with KlowdTV's free tier and premium channels, these three VPNs delivered consistent, buffer-free streaming:

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for KlowdTV Streaming

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|8,800+ in 129 countries|
|**US Locations**|16 cities (1,900+ servers)|
|**Speed (tested)**|779 Mbps average|
|**Encryption**|AES-256|
|**Devices**|10 simultaneous|
|**Price**|$2.99/month (2-year plan)|
|**Trial**|30-day money-back guarantee|

**Why NordVPN wins for streaming:**

I've tested NordVPN with KlowdTV for six months straight. Not a single buffering issue on the free channels. Premium HD content streamed flawlessly, even during peak evening hours when network congestion is highest.

The **NordLynx protocol** (their WireGuard implementation) is ridiculously fast. In head-to-head tests against Surfshark and ExpressVPN, NordVPN consistently delivered the highest sustained speeds—critical when you're streaming live news or events.

**Honest cons:**

* Monthly pricing is steep ($12.99) compared to annual plans
* The desktop app can feel busy for first-timers with all its features
* Not the absolute cheapest option available

But for streaming reliability? Worth every penny.

# 2. Surfshark – Budget-Friendly Speed Demon

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|4,500+ in 100 countries|
|**US Locations**|25 cities|
|**Speed (tested)**|1,615 Mbps peak|
|**Encryption**|AES-256|
|**Devices**|Unlimited|
|**Price**|$1.99/month (2-year plan)|
|**Trial**|30-day money-back guarantee|

Surfshark shocked me with its raw speed—over 1,600 Mbps in recent tests. That's faster than NordVPN in pure download benchmarks. For KlowdTV's 720p streams, this translates to instant loading and zero buffering.

The killer feature? **Unlimited device connections.** Connect your phone, tablet, laptop, TV, and smart fridge if you want. No limits.

**Trade-offs:**

* Upload speeds can drop significantly (not a streaming issue, but affects video calls)
* Newer service than NordVPN (less proven long-term track record)

If budget is tight and you need to protect multiple devices, Surfshark delivers impressive value.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Premium Performance, Premium Price

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|3,000+ in 105 countries|
|**US Locations**|Multiple cities|
|**Speed (tested)**|1,374 Mbps transatlantic|
|**Encryption**|AES-256|
|**Devices**|10 simultaneous|
|**Price**|$6.67/month (annual plan)|
|**Trial**|30-day money-back guarantee|

ExpressVPN is the ""just works"" option. In my testing, it unblocked KlowdTV every single time, with excellent speeds and rock-solid connections. The **Lightway protocol** (their proprietary tech) is optimized for streaming.

The downside? It's expensive. You're paying for premium support, proven reliability, and a longer track record. If you value consistency over saving a few bucks, ExpressVPN won't disappoint.

|VPN|Best For|Speed|US Servers|Price|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|Overall streaming quality|779 Mbps|1,900+|$2.99/mo|🏆|
|**Surfshark**|Budget + unlimited devices|1,615 Mbps|25 cities|$1.99/mo|🏆|
|**ExpressVPN**|Premium reliability|1,374 Mbps|Multiple|$6.67/mo|—|

# Troubleshooting: When KlowdTV Won't Work with Your VPN

Even with a quality VPN, you might hit snags. Here's how to fix common issues:

# Problem: ""Content Not Available in Your Region""

**Cause:** KlowdTV detected your VPN's IP address or found cached location data.

**Solutions:**

1. **Switch to a different US server.** Not all VPN servers work equally well—some IPs get flagged by streaming platforms. Try 2-3 different US cities.
2. **Clear ALL browser data** (not just cookies). Cache, local storage, everything.
3. **Disable browser location services.** Go to your browser settings and deny KlowdTV access to your GPS location.
4. **Use incognito/private mode.** This prevents old cookies from interfering.

⚠️ **Warning:** If you're on mobile, make sure your device's GPS is disabled or your VPN has GPS spoofing (rare). Apps can detect location through GPS, not just IP address.

# Problem: Constant Buffering and Stuttering

**Cause:** Your VPN connection is too slow for HD streaming.

**Solutions:**

1. **Connect to a geographically closer US server.** If you're in Europe, East Coast servers > West Coast.
2. **Switch VPN protocols.** Try WireGuard or NordLynx instead of OpenVPN (check your VPN's settings).
3. **Close background apps** eating bandwidth. Netflix running in another tab? Torrent client downloading? Shut 'em down.
4. **Check your base internet speed** at speedtest.net. If it's under 25 Mbps *without* VPN, that's your bottleneck.

KlowdTV streams in 720p HD, which needs about 5-10 Mbps. If your VPN connection can't hit that consistently, you'll buffer.

# Problem: VPN Works on Computer But Not on TV/Roku

**Cause:** Your streaming device doesn't support VPN apps directly.

**Solutions:**

1. **Install VPN on your router.** This protects all devices on your network. Requires compatible router and some technical know-how.
2. **Use a VPN with Smart DNS.** NordVPN's SmartPlay feature works on devices that don't support full VPN apps.
3. **Get a streaming device with native VPN support.** Fire TV Stick and Android TV boxes let you install VPN apps directly.

I've had great luck running NordVPN directly on my Fire TV Stick—takes 5 minutes to set up and works flawlessly with KlowdTV.

# Is Using a VPN to Watch KlowdTV Legal?

Short answer: Yes, in most countries.

Using a VPN is legal in the US, UK, Canada, and most democratic nations. You're not breaking any laws by changing your virtual location to access content you're already paying for (or content that's freely available in another region).

**The ethical gray area:** KlowdTV's Terms of Service might technically prohibit VPN use, though I couldn't find explicit language about this in their current ToS. Streaming platforms generally prefer you don't bypass geo-restrictions, but enforcement is rare for individual users.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Millions of people use VPNs daily to access geo-restricted content. The VPN industry exists specifically for this purpose. No one's getting prosecuted for streaming news channels while traveling.

That said, downloading copyrighted content via torrents is a different story. Stick to legitimate streaming through official platforms.

# Why KlowdTV Speed Matters (And How VPNs Affect It)

KlowdTV streams most content in **720p HD**, with some channels offering **1080p**. Here's what you need speed-wise:

|Quality|Required Speed|VPN Recommendation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Standard (480p)|3 Mbps|Any VPN works|
|HD (720p)|5-10 Mbps|NordVPN, Surfshark|
|Full HD (1080p)|15-25 Mbps|NordVPN, ExpressVPN|

A good VPN should only reduce your speed by **10-20%**. In my testing:

* **NordVPN:** 12% average speed reduction
* **Surfshark:** 8% average speed reduction
* **ExpressVPN:** 15% average speed reduction

These numbers are well within ""streaming-friendly"" territory. Compare that to free VPNs, which often cut speeds by 50-70%, and you see why paying for quality matters.

# Device Compatibility: Where Can You Stream KlowdTV with a VPN?

One of KlowdTV's strengths is broad device support. The VPN works seamlessly across:

|Device Type|KlowdTV Support|VPN Compatibility|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Smart TVs**|Samsung, LG, Sony|Via router or Smart DNS|
|**Streaming Boxes**|Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV|Native VPN apps (Fire TV)|
|**Mobile**|iOS, Android|Native VPN apps|
|**Desktop**|Windows, Mac, Linux|Native VPN apps|
|**Gaming**|Xbox|Via router or Smart DNS|

🔥 **Hot Take:** Fire TV Stick + NordVPN is the easiest setup I've tested. Install both apps directly on the stick, connect to US server, done. No router configuration, no complex settings.

# Alternative Methods (That Aren't as Good as VPNs)

Some guides suggest Smart DNS or proxy servers for unblocking KlowdTV. I've tested both extensively. Here's why they fall short:

**Smart DNS:**

* **Pros:** Slightly faster than VPN (no encryption overhead)
* **Cons:** Zero privacy protection, doesn't work if ISP blocks DNS changes, limited device support

**Free Proxies:**

* **Pros:** Free
* **Cons:** Slow as molasses, unreliable, massive security risk, often don't work with streaming

**Browser Extensions (Hola, Urban VPN):**

* **Pros:** Easy to install
* **Cons:** Most sell your data, terrible speeds, blocked by streaming platforms

A quality VPN costs $2-3 monthly. The peace of mind, reliable access, and actual privacy protection blow these ""free"" alternatives out of the water.

# Final Thoughts: Is a VPN Worth It for KlowdTV?

Look, if you're traveling abroad, living outside the US, or just want to access KlowdTV's content without restrictions—a VPN is the only practical solution that actually works consistently.

I've tested this extensively with NordVPN over six months. Zero issues. Fast connections. Reliable access to all KlowdTV tiers, from the free channels to premium subscriptions.

The investment is minimal (under $3 monthly for quality services), setup takes minutes, and you gain way more than just KlowdTV access. You're also:

* Protecting your privacy from ISP tracking
* Securing your connection on public WiFi
* Unblocking other geo-restricted content (Netflix, BBC iPlayer, sports streams)

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Always choose the longest-term plan your VPN offers. Monthly pricing is a ripoff—you'll pay 3-4x more than annual subscribers. NordVPN's 2-year plan drops the monthly cost to $2.99 versus $12.99 for month-to-month.

**My honest recommendation:** Start with NordVPN's 30-day trial. Test it with KlowdTV on all your devices. If it works for your setup (it should), commit to the annual plan. If not, get your money back and try Surfshark.

The frustration of geo-blocks isn't worth the hassle. Spend less than a coffee monthly and watch what you want, when you want, from wherever you want.",1,1769403616.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

(& old ui polish),"hey droppy dev team: i’ve been using droppy a lot and i really love the concept, but i wanted to share some honest feedback about the current version because it feels like a lot of the best parts of droppy’s identity got removed or downgraded.

# biggest issue: liquid glass dynamic island removed

i'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but the liquid glass dynamic island isn't showing up anymore, and it was honestly one of the most unique and charming parts of droppy. right now, the app doesn't appeal to me as much, especially because i used the island all the time and its liquid glass appearance really stuck with me. 

# also missing: the cute notch face + original file drop visuals

the old notch file drop experience was amazing because it had the cute notch face, the unique airdrop icon, and the unique animations (same thing with the basket too). those animations gave droppy personality and made it feel fun and lively.

# music hover looked better before (bring back 3d tilt)

in my opinion, the music/photo hover looked way better when you hovered near the edges and it would tilt like a 3d card effect. could you integrate that old 3d tilt behavior into the current hover system? it would make the current hover features feel much more alive again.

# rounded corners + old window/basket appearance (please revert)

the rounded corners on windows and baskets don’t look as polished as they used to. i really think the old appearance looked better overall. honestly i’d love it if the entire settings ui went back to the old version, because the older one felt cleaner, more consistent, and more liquid glass.

# buttons used to look better too (clipboard included)

the older versions had much nicer liquid glass buttons across all windows (including clipboard). now the buttons feel flatter and less cohesive. i'm also confused about the buy me a coffee button — is it not yellow anymore?

# intro guide / onboarding needs to revert to the 6.0 version

the current introduction guide feels not centered, cluttered, and icons don’t work properly (selecting notch or dynamic island). basically, the 6.0 introduction walkthrough was cleaner and way easier to follow. please bring that style back.

# feature ideas / improvements for future versions

if you’re planning upgrades, here are some ideas that in my opinion would make droppy even better:

* option for a permanent liquid glass dynamic island (toggle in settings)
* more notch/dynamic island-based features, like:
   * quick search for files / clipboard entries
   * quick actions (ask siri, start a timer, etc.)
   * live actions / status widgets
   * ai chat assistant inside the notch
   * extensions like the monocle app (ex: blur inactive windows / focus mode)

the older versions had such a strong identity and polish, and i’d love to see that come back with the newer features. would love to hear if anyone else feels the same :)",2,1769403607.0,Droppy,0,1.0,False

Putting myself out there to make some genuine connections. I’m more on the introverted side and do best one on one or in smaller conversations. I’d much rather talk about real stuff, random thoughts, or trade sarcastic comments than force small talk.

My schedule is a little unconventional which means I’m around at odd hours and actually pretty consistent once I connect with someone. In warmer months I’m usually outside hiking, walking trails, or just enjoying being outdoors. In the colder months I slow things down with books, shows, coffee, and staying cozy.

I’m easygoing, laid back, sarcastic once comfortable, and a good listener. Looking for friends who want to actually talk and get to know each other, whether that’s daily chats or just checking in when life allows.

If you’re also looking for a low pressure, genuine friendship and enjoy meaningful conversations with a bit of humor mixed in, feel free to reach out.",1,1769403505.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

My husband had a sister-well, that was what he called her. She was adopted.

I pushed open the door and found them tangled together on the couch, naked as the day they were born. 

The woman didn’t scream. Instead, she smiled at me. 

She tossed me a box. Inside was a thick stack of IOUS, every single one signed by my husband. 

“Your husband can’t pay me back,” she said. “So, he fucks me three times a week. The interest? That diamond ring on your finger.” 

I smiled. 

“Okay,” I said. 

I came home from my business trip early, hoping to surprise my husband. 

The door was unlocked. 

Holding the late-night takeout I’d picked up for Ian, I stood frozen in the foyer. 

From the living room came the muffled, unmistakable gasps of a woman. Then there was also the heavy, ragged breathing of a man. 

It was a sound I knew all too well. 

It was my husband of three years. Ian. 

I stopped mid-step, one shoe still in my hand. 

The blood in my veins turned to ice. 

My suitcase slipped from my fingers and hit the floor with a thud. 

Thump. 

The frantic sounds from the couch cut off abruptly. 

A dead silence filled the living room. 

“Who’s there?” 

It was Ian’s voice, husky with lingering desire and a thread of panic. 

I didn’t answer. 

I walked slowly, step by step, toward the source of the sounds I just heard.

Chapter 1 

The living room lights were off. 

The only illumination was the cold, pale moonlight seeping through the windows. 

It outlined two figures intertwined on the sofa. 

Naked. Gleaming with sweat. Fused together. 

Ian went rigid. 

But the woman beneath him slowly, ever so slowly, lifted her head. 

She smiled at me. 

I knew that face. 

Vivian. The ‘sister’ Ian was always talking about. 

“Hey, Jasmine. You’re home early.” 

Her voice was sugary sweet, like poison dipped in honey. 

Ian scrambled to get off her, fumbling for something to cover himself. 

100 

\+20 Free Coins 

But Vivian hooked an arm around his neck and pressed him down. She reached behind him, sinking a strap-on toy deeper into him, holding him in place. 

Her nails dug into his bare shoulders. 

“Don’t move, brother,” she purred. 

Her eyes met mine, filled with naked challenge and triumph. 

“The show’s not over for our audience.” 

A wave of nausea, pure and visceral, hit me. 

I felt sick to my stomach. 

I watched them, feeling like I was witnessing some grotesque silent play. 

I reached over and flicked on the main light. 

Let’s see how brazen they could be under full glare. 

Ian’s face was paper-white under the harsh light. 

“Jasmine… It’s not what you think…” 

His voice trembled.

“Then what is it?” 

I finally spoke. My voice sounded eerily calm and detached, like it belonged to someone else. 

Vivian let out a light, tinkling laugh. 

She pushed Ian aside and took her time retrieving a slinky slip dress from between the couch cushions, sliding it on with deliberate slowness. 

Then, she bent and pulled a delicate velvet box from under the coffee table. 

She walked right up to me. 

The cloying scent of her perfume, mixed with the smell of sex, hit me in the face. 

“Here, Jasmine. Let me show you something.” 

She opened the box. 

There was neither jewelry inside nor trinkets inside. 

Just a thick, neat stack of papers. 

Promissory notes. IOUS. 

Every last one was signed at the bottom with Ian’s flamboyant signature. 

My eyes locked onto the amount on the top note. 

$500,000. 

The date was three years ago. 

Right after we got married. 

So, it started back then. 

A tightness seized my chest, stealing my breath. 

Vivian watched my face, a satisfied smirk curling her lips. 

“Your husband owes me ten million dollars.” 

Then, as if it wasn’t clear enough, she added, “He can’t pay.” 

Her finger traced the edges of the notes, a caress that was almost tender. 

“So, we worked out a new… repayment plan.” 

She jerked her chin toward Ian, who was still huddled on the couch. Her look was a mix of scorn and possession.

Her gaze finally dropped, landing on the diamond solitaire on my left hand. 

The ring… Ian bought it for me with his first big project bonus. 

He’d said it was a symbol of our love. 

Vivian smiled. It was an innocent, cruel smile. 

“As for the interest…” 

Her gaze darted back to my face. “That would be the diamond fing you’re wearing.” 

“He told me it was his most precious possession,” she added sweetly. 

Then, with a saccharine smile, she decided, “I think it’ll do nicely. ",1,1769403341.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1qn6lko,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qn6lko/the_psychology_of_supporting_someones_mental/,The Psychology of Supporting Someone's Mental Illness: 5 Do's and Don'ts That Actually Work,"I have been researching mental health support for months after watching close friends struggle, and honestly? Most advice out there is trash. The ""just be there for them"" stuff sounds nice, but leaves you completely clueless when shit hits the fan.

Here's what actually works, pulled from therapists, research papers, and people who've been on both sides of this. No fluff.

**1. DO validate their experience without trying to fix it**

Could you stop jumping into solution mode? When someone tells you they're depressed, anxious, or struggling, your instinct might be to offer advice. Don't. 

Dr. Marsha Linehan (the psychologist who literally created DBT therapy while dealing with her own mental health struggles) emphasizes validation as the foundation of support. It means acknowledging their pain is real, even if you don't fully understand it.

Say things like ""that sounds incredibly hard"" or ""I can see this is really affecting you."" Not ""have you tried yoga?"" or ""my cousin had anxiety, and she just started running."" 

The difference is massive. One makes people feel heard. The other makes them feel like their pain is a simple problem you just solved in 10 seconds, which is honestly insulting.

**2. DON'T make their mental illness about you**

This is where people fuck up constantly. Someone opens up about their depression, and suddenly you're trauma dumping about your own struggles or, worse, getting defensive about how their behavior affects you.

I get it. Mental illness impacts everyone around the person. But when they are vulnerable enough to share, that's not your moment. 

Save the ""your anxiety makes me stressed"" conversation for later, ideally with a therapist present if it's a serious relationship. In the moment of disclosure, just listen.

**3. DO learn about their specific condition**

Sounds obvious, but most people don't do this. If your friend has bipolar disorder, read about bipolar disorder. Not just Wikipedia, but actual resources.

The National Institute of Mental Health has solid free information. So does the therapy app Bloom, which has a whole section explaining different conditions in plain language. I spent hours on there learning about OCD after realizing I had zero clue what it actually involved (spoiler: it's not just being neat).

For anyone who wants a more structured way to understand mental health, there's BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology research, therapy frameworks, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can literally type in ""how to support someone with anxiety"" or ""understanding bipolar disorder as a friend,"" and it generates a custom podcast from credible sources like clinical studies and therapist interviews. 

You control the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive (the calm, professional tone works great for heavy topics). It's been useful for learning about specific conditions without falling down random internet rabbit holes.

Podcast rec: [The Hilarious World of Depression](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-hilarious-world-of-depression/id1181589175). Sounds counterintuitive, but host John Moe interviews comedians and public figures about depression in ways that genuinely help you understand the internal experience. It's insanely good at building empathy without being preachy.

Understanding the condition helps you stop saying harmful shit. Like telling someone with depression to ""think positive"" or asking someone with an eating disorder why they ""just don't eat normally.""

**4. DON'T force them to talk or do things before they're ready**

The ""I'm dragging you out of the house because isolation is bad for you"" approach backfires more often than it works. Yes, behavioral activation helps depression. But forced socialization when someone isn't ready creates more anxiety and shame.

Ask what they need. Sometimes it's company. Sometimes it's space. Sometimes it's you sitting next to them in silence while they exist.

There's solid research from behavioral psychology showing that pushing people into situations they're not equipped to handle actually reinforces avoidance behaviors. You're trying to help but potentially making things worse.

Offer invitations without pressure. ""I'm going to the coffee shop to work; if you want to join, totally cool if not."" Give them the option to participate in low-stakes ways.

**5. DO encourage professional help without being pushy**

Here's the tricky one. Mental illness often requires professional treatment. Therapy, medication, or both. Your support matters, but it's not a replacement for actual treatment.

That said, telling someone ""you need therapy"" in the middle of a breakdown is not helpful. Wait for a calmer moment. Frame it as adding tools, not admitting defeat.

Share resources casually. ""I've heard good things about BetterHelp for online therapy,"" or ""my insurance covers mental health; I can help you figure out if yours does.""

The book ""[Maybe You Should Talk to Someone](https://www.amazon.com/Maybe-You-Should-Talk-Someone/dp/1328662055)"" by Lori Gottlieb is perfect for people who are hesitant about therapy. She's a therapist who went to therapy herself, and it demystifies the whole process. Makes it feel less scary and more like a practical step.

If they're resistant, drop it and bring it up again later. Sometimes people need to hear it multiple times before they're ready.

**Bonus insight: know your limits**

Support doesn't mean sacrificing your own mental health. You can care about someone deeply and still set boundaries. You can't pour from an empty cup and all that, but genuinely, if supporting them is destroying you, something needs to change.

This isn't abandonment. It's sustainability. Get support for yourself too, whether that's therapy, support groups for loved ones of people with mental illness, or just regular check-ins with other friends.

The app Supportiv connects you anonymously with people going through similar situations in real time. It's been helpful when I needed to vent about the stress of supporting someone without making it about me to them.

Mental illness is complicated. Biology, trauma, and circumstances all play roles. Your support won't cure anyone, but it can make the journey less lonely. And sometimes that's everything.

Me and a few graduating studio art BFA students at Tulane are trying to figure out how to organize and stage a group exhibition with our thesis work somewhere unaffiliated from the university. Nothing scandalous, there's just not enough space for all the graduates to exhibit in the campus gallery during Commencement and we are trying to find an alternative way to allow our friends and loved ones to see our artwork while they're in the city to watch us graduate. I'm looking for ideas as to where we might be able to stage the exhibit- we're planning on handling installation, show promotion, any associated exhibition openings ourselves but most traditional gallery spaces are already slotted to stage shows during the relevant weekend (May 15-17). I've started wondering whether it might be worth reaching out to unoccupied property owners on Maple/Oak/Freret to see if they'd be willing to let us stage a salon-style exhibition in otherwise unused real estate. I feel like this is a long shot so I'd love to hear if any of y'all have alternative ideas or know of warehouse spaces/coffee shops/restaurants/literally anywhere that might have the capacity to host the thesis work of 3-5 students, and perhaps allow us to host a reception on May 14th. Fingers crossed- I'd really love for my parents to see what I've spent the breadth of my college years dedicated to. Thanks in advance! ",2,1769403104.0,NewOrleans,1,1.0,False

""Is that understood?""

The Dean was lecturing me, and I stared down at my lap, trying to fathom how I had gotten myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, as if I were some escaped psychopath.

Every time I shifted, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer’s dream. The Dean herself was my mother’s age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn’t a mistake.

But it’s not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college’s draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn’t Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I’m a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I’m a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor’s expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She’d sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn’t react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn’t try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can talk.”

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn’t resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Hiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn’t notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that working out for ya?”

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he’d stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...” 

He dragged out the “ey” sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn’t show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing façade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane!”

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Byeeeeee!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

“Coming in?”

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all.

However I was blindsided so it wasn’t a gradual breakup. One day he was loving and the next he treated me like a stranger. We dated 5 years and lived together.

I moved out right away to live with my mom. I got severely depressed and felt hopeless. Reached out to him in desperation. We talked a bit then went no contact. 1 month later he profusely apologizes admitting he’s been incredibly sad I’m gone and will sob in his car. He wanted to go for coffee and talk.

I was still traumatized so I asked for time. And told him I’d reach out when I was ready.

Fast forward 3 more weeks I call him on the phone to schedule our coffee meet up. We ended up talking all night. However his demeanour was completely different. He seemed happier with me gone. He’d been doing more hobbies, working more, being with friends. He said he has no romantic feelings for me but he’ll always love me.

I was so shocked since his last conversation he admitted he felt things for me. So much hot and cold behaviour. He still wants to meet for coffee and be friends. I told him he needs to start therapy before I see him next(he was already planning on therapy). He agreed to this. I think him talking to a professional about the breakup would be helpful before seeing me. He ended things in a horrible way and I worry if I see him before therapy he’ll end up hurting me more.

It’s been a month already. But I feel like it’s better I wait for him to reach out since I’m the desperate one.

In no specific order:

Pizza: Gotta start off controversial here, but **Wheelz**. I love the sourdough crust, very consistent every time I’ve gotten it, and not too heavy. Everyone is different. Not a fan of deep dish stuff. **Brooklyn Pizza Co.** is a close 2nd.

Coffee: **Maven**. I’ve traveled the world and can honestly put them top 10 all time for me. The owner is super knowledgeable and is a master of his craft.

Burgers: Admittedly haven’t explored a lot of spots after having **Grimmburger**. Love their Carolina reaper burger. Perfect level of spice and delicious all around.

Mexican: I’ll stop gate keeping here - but **Tortilleria Y Taqueria Carolinas**. The best burrito in town full stop. I’ve also had the quesabarria tacos - very solid.

Upscale dinner: **Kipos**. I’ve seen some hate on this place, but I can’t help but disagree full stop. It’s expensive, sure, but it’s really great food. Every app, dish, desert I’ve gotten there has been phenomenal.

Cocktails: **The blind elephant**. Solid menu - not much of a drinker anymore - but the vibes were super cool. Close second (but niche situation) is Concorde espresso. Love a good fire pit with some s’mores and cocktails.

Casual lunch: **PTs/Saltworks** \- tie here. Love em both equally. The PTs grilled chicken sandwich is absolute fire. Saltworks makes me feel like I’m at a family cookout in a good way. No thrills and frills. Just solid food.

Bagels: **S&L** by a long shot. Some of the best bagels I’ve ever had. Staff is super nice and the New York memorabilia and vibes are top notch.

Sushi: **Tomiko San** \- as a sushi lover that has been to Japan, I will say Wilmington was missing a spot like this. I’m talking high end fish offerings flown in. Not fried rolls with cream cheese and the like. If you like real sushi - this is your spot.

Poke: **Pipeline Poke** \- this spot is so good. Their spicy tuna lava poke bowl is unreal. I have not found a spot that comes close (although I haven’t felt the need to explore further haha).

Sandwich: **Spoonfed Kitchen -** kind of niche, but I love their bahn mi chicken sandwich. Such a unique take on a bahn mi, full of flavor, chicken is grilled to perfection.

Breakfast - **Amanecer Cocina & Café** \- just recently found this spot and holy hell they have some of the best breakfast burritos I’ve ever had. Pancakes are also absolutely fire. 10/10

I’m exploring whether there’s any real demand for a quiet, adult-focused space where people could read, study, or work without the usual café pressure (noise, time limits, uncomfortable, etc.). Think more “lingering with a book” than productivity hustle — with optional things like coffee during the day, wine/drinks in the evening (speakeasy feel), and occasional hosted events (e.g., book club, silent reading parties, poetry/jazz evenings, etc.)

Before going any further, I want to sanity-check whether this is something people here would actually use, or if it’s just a nice-sounding idea that doesn’t fit San Diego.

Some questions I have for you all are:

\- Is this realistically a place you’d frequent?

\- What's missing or frustrates you when you’ve gone to read or study at other cafés/bookstores/bars?

\- What do you wish a place like this would have? (E.g., free books, comfy chairs, etc.)

\- Would you be open to paying for access or membership benefits (e.g., discounts, reserved seating, events)?

Graveyard shift. 3:17 a.m. Level B-West, sub-basement. Three years, same forty-minute loop. Fire doors. Card readers. Elevators are not jammed open. Routine. Boring. Soul-eating.

Until it wasn’it.

Turned the corner on sub-level 4. Froze. Yellow emergency strips painted everything sick. The stairwell was wrong. Railings bent in, steps stretched out, more than seventeen. I counted. Nineteen. Twenty-one. Too many.

Just the angle, and I told myself. Just the light. Double shift chewing at my brain.

Then I heard it.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

Soft, wet scrape from below. Like feet peeling off wet linoleum. Drag. Pause. Drag. Closer. Never a rhythm. I froze. Radio in my hand, dead weight. Who would I call? Facilities locked up. The supervisor is probably snoring upstairs. Whatever was down there, it didn’t want company.

I backed up one step. The scrape stopped instantly.

Dead silence.

Then, very faintly, I heard a low, wet exhale. Not a sigh. More like someone trying to remember how to use their lungs.

Flashlight shaking in my hand. I pointed it down. The beam caught a long, dark yellow smear on the landing. Fresh paint, but wrong. It moved. Rippled. Something down there, breathing.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Up the stairs. Lungs burning, boots slamming. The rail is too cold, slick with something. Didn’t look back. If I did, the stairs would stretch. That thing would be closer.

Slammed into the sub-level 3 fire door. Panic bar clanged. It opened. Thank God. I stumbled into the corridor. Beige walls. Lights working. Old coffee stinks from the break room.

The door slammed shut behind me. I leaned hard, chest heaving.

From the other side came one last sound.

Not scraping this time.

A single, deliberate knock.

Patient. Polite.

Like someone asking to be let back in.

I didn’t open the door.

I didn’t go back down there for the rest of the shift.

But sometimes, when the building goes dead quiet, and I’m alone in the security office, I hear it again.

are there any places in the city that give something free on birthdays?
Could be anything small:
Free coffee
Free dessert
Free chai
Any café offers
Any brand/store birthday perks
Not expecting anything big, just curious and thought I’d ask 😄
Sometimes small gestures make the day feel special.
Thanks in advance ❤️",0,1769401812.0,Chandigarh,9,0.29,False
