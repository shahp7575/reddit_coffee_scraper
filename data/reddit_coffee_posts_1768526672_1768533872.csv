1qe4urq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1qe4urq/am_i_paranoid_for_not_taking_the_train_home_from/,Am I paranoid for not taking the train home from work?,"I've been in Chicago for 10 whole days now and have already had 3 awful experiences with the CTA. First was a dude who threw his coffee cup at me and then started screaming that I was in the FBI and I was gangstalking him. The second was a dude who went up right next to me at a station, went to punch me in the face, and stopped an inch away and then wandered off yelling about how he killed a lady and enjoyed it (started avoiding the red line after this). And then today there was a guy who looked completely disoriented just wandering around Fullerton station pointing a knife around. These are all rides leaving the loop and going North during rush hour. I've been to NYC countless times and ridden the subway there at all hours and nothing even close to this has happened there, so I naively thought Chicago would be similar. 

Is it absurd for me to start taking an Uber from the loop to Fullerton at the end of the work day to avoid this? I talk to people who take the train every day with no issue but I've had problems on at least 50% of my rides so far. I've had no issues on the Brown line from Fullerton to the Loop in the morning, but anything else has been plain awful.",2,1768533690.0,AskChicago,2,1.0,False
1qe4s8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qe4s8d/i_got_tired_of_inconsistent_cups_so_i_built_a/,"I got tired of inconsistent cups, so I built a free tool to handle my ratios, recipes, and brew logs","Hi everyone,

I’ve been a home brewer for a while, but I always found myself fumbling with the calculator app on my phone half-asleep, trying to figure out the water weight for an 18g dose. Worse, I kept forgetting which grind setting or temperature I used for that one perfect cup I made last week.

So, I spent the last few months building a dedicated web app to solve this for myself, and I decided to open it up for free to the community.

It’s called Ratiocraft.

What it does:

* Smart Calculator: You put in your dose and method (V60, Aeropress, etc.), and it gives you the exact water weight and steps instantly.
* Digital Coffee Journal (For Registered Users): This is the big one. You can upload your coffee batches (photos of the bag, origin info) and rate them.
* Brew Logging: For every batch, you can log your daily brews. Take notes on taste, rate the cup, and record your variables.
* The Goal: To build a personal history of what you drank so you never buy bad coffee twice and—more importantly—so you can actually replicate that ""God Shot"" consistently instead of guessing.

Why I built it: I wanted something that looked clean, loaded fast, and worked right in the browser without needing to download an app store file.

I’d love your feedback: It’s still a work in progress (currently obsessing over adding ""Binocular Dripper"" tech), but I’d love to know if the logging flow feels intuitive to you.

I've kept this list the last couple of years, since moving to Canberra, and I just did my updates for 2026. I started the list mainly for my own benefit but when I've shared it in the past, others have enjoyed having everything in one place, so here it is again. 2026 data has all been verified (or in a couple of instances is not yet available, and that is noted in those cases).

I'm not affiliated with any of these markets, just like to know what's on and to have fun things at my fingertips on weekends :)

I dated a project manager who got divorced (apparently) because he dealt with stress by drinking. He didn’t say that directly, but he told me his ex would say stuff like:

“You’re only working from home. Why do you always act like you’re so overworked you can’t do anything? Tired from what? Sleeping on the couch?”

When I stayed over, he took breaks constantly. Coffee, breakfast, lunch, all during work hours. But at the same time, he’d act like he was so overwhelmed that he couldn’t see me or even talk to me.

I didn't know if this day would ever arrive, and I've felt like I've been gaslighting myself that it was even possible. 

My dysbiosis began after a 10 day regimen of clindamycin (which followed finding out that I was allergic to penicillin). I also had EBV more than a year ago for four months, and I don't know if this also contributed. I've been such a mess since the beginning of October, and reading narratives in this sub where some people seem to never heal has had me in my feelings. 

I'm not entirely cured, and I still have little moments, a little more gas than I'd like and some occasional belching, but for three days, I have mostly felt ""normal"". It could all flip on me again tomorrow, but I will cherish this feeling in the meantime. 

My technique toward progress:

\- Greek yogurt with blueberries, an unripe banana and psyllium husk powder in the morning  
\- Fermented foods, either kimchi or organic raw sauerkraut at least daily (probiotics didn't work for me and made me much worse)  
\- B12, D3/K2 in the morning, magnesium glycinate at night before bed  
\- Digesting chewable enzymes with ""iffy"" meals, of which there have been few   
\- Eliminating almost all added sugars with a 1x/week donut cheat and a half dozen jelly beans daily (a person has got to live)  
\- Eliminating almost 100% of processed foods and eating lots of eggs, chicken, fruits and vegetables every day  
\- glycine powder in the evening with a glass of water  
\- drinking herbal teas all day, especially lemon ginger and peppermint  
\- Not a drop of alcohol since I started clindamycin   
\- And finally, being VERY deliberate and mindful with every thing I put in my body

As everyone who visits this sub inherently understands, my solution (fingers crossed) is not everyone's solution, and this approach won't work on perhaps even the majority of you suffering with different gut issues.

The object is fast, moving on a hyperbolic trajectory typical of an interstellar visitor, yet its behavior has scientists buzzing. As it approaches our Sun's perihelion, the anomalies multiply. Unlike typical comets which release massive amounts of dust and gas due to solar heating, 3I Atlas remains stubbornly intact and incredibly dense. Its light curve doesn't just brighten; it pulses with unnatural regularity. The leading speculation among frustrated astronomers is that some unknown property of its ""ice"" resists sublimation, a natural curiosity they muse about over coffee.

But the truth, whispered in dimly lit corners of the internet, paints a different picture.

Those anomalies? The perfect, unwavering density? The strange, non-natural pulsing light as it navigates the inner system? They aren't quirks of nature. They are the calculated movements of a disguised vessel, a colossal mothership using solar gravity to slingshot its way toward Earth. The ""comet"" 3I Atlas isn't just visiting our solar system—it's here, and it’s right on schedule.

The first hun ever. I'm not sure if I should be honored, but it's fascinating seeing what these huns do without having to peruse this sub.

**Details:** I have an IG account because a lot of anti-MLM advocates are on there, so I like to follow them and check out their reels/posts. I don't engage the algorithm-fed content. However, I got a notification of a new follow. I look at it and I expected it to be a bot account.

When I noticed it wasn't a bot account, I went through the profile. It raised every red flag in the anti‑MLM checklist: Posting (mostly) every day? Check. Canned copy/paste content longer than *War and Peace*? Check. Sus health claims? Check. Hashtag spam? Check. Low engagement? Check.

The content was we see all the time. Her posts offer vague promises about healing “inflammation,” “aches,” and “pain,"" by drinking “anti‑inflammatory” coffee or tea, paired with a patch. At first glance, it could have been any number of wellness scams like Super Patch. On one post, the hashtags gave it away with clear nods to LifeWave and MLM in general.

Now that I have seen how these huns operate for myself is both fascinating and disheartening. When MLMs target older adults (this hun is a legitimate Baby Boomer), they exploit vulnerability in ways that echo phishing scams and other predatory tactics. I can't begin to tell you how much it enrages me.

The object is fast, moving on a hyperbolic trajectory typical of an interstellar visitor, yet its behavior has scientists buzzing. As it approaches our Sun's perihelion, the anomalies multiply. Unlike typical comets which release massive amounts of dust and gas due to solar heating, 3I Atlas remains stubbornly intact and incredibly dense. Its light curve doesn't just brighten; it pulses with unnatural regularity. The leading speculation among frustrated astronomers is that some unknown property of its ""ice"" resists sublimation, a natural curiosity they muse about over coffee.

But the truth, whispered in dimly lit corners of the internet, paints a different picture.

Those anomalies? The perfect, unwavering density? The strange, non-natural pulsing light as it navigates the inner system? They aren't quirks of nature. They are the calculated movements of a disguised vessel, a colossal mothership using solar gravity to slingshot its way toward Earth. The ""comet"" 3I Atlas isn't just visiting our solar system—it's here, and it’s right on schedule.

They treat agents like smart, autonomous teammates/junior dev with their own volition and intuition and then wonder why the output is chaotic, inconsistent, or subtly/less subtly broken.

An agent is not a “better ChatGPT.” The correct mental model when using agent to write your code is to be **an orchestrator of its execution**, not let it be independent thinker and expecting ""here is a task based on custom domain and my own codebase, make it work"". You have to define the structure, constraints, rules, and expectations. The agent just runs inside that box. You don't want agent to be creative or ""figure it out"", you want agent on shortest chain possible to do the heavy lifting for you when you need it to.

ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. work *standalone* because they come with heavy built-in guardrails and guidelines and are tuned for conversation and problem solving, plus they get lot more resources per call. Agents, on the other hand, touch *all* content they have zero idea about: your code, files, tools, side effects. They don’t magically inherit discipline or domain knowledge. They have to get that knowledge.

If you don’t supply your own guardrails, standards, and explicit instructions, the agent will happily optimize for speed and hallucinate its way through your repo.

Agents amplify intent. If your intent isn’t well-defined, they amplify chaos.

What really worked best for me is this structure, for example:

You have this task to extend customer login logic:  
\[long wall of text that is probably JIRA task written by PM before having morning coffee\]

*this is the point where most people hit enter and just wait for agent to do ""magic"", but there is more*

To complete this task, you have to do X and Y, in those location A and B etc.

Before you start on this task use the file in root directory named **guidelines.txt** to figure how to write the code.

And this is where the magic happens, in guidelines.txt you want:

* all your ins and outs of your domain, your workflow (simplified)
* where the meat of the app is located (models, views, infrastructure)
* the less obvious ""gotchas""
* what the agent can touch
* what the agent must NEVER touch or only after manual approval
* patterns it should respect

This approach yielded best and faster results for me and least ""man, that is just wrong, what the hell""",0,1768532709.0,ExperiencedDevs,14,0.06,False
1qe4hot,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1qe4hot/i_got_tired_of_inconsistent_cups_so_i_built_a/,"I got tired of inconsistent cups, so I built a free tool to handle my ratios, recipes, and brew logs in one place.","Hi everyone,

I’ve been a home brewer for a while, but I always found myself fumbling with the calculator app on my phone half-asleep, trying to figure out the water weight for an 18g dose. Worse, I kept forgetting which grind setting or temperature I used for that one perfect cup I made last week.

So, I spent the last few months building a dedicated web app to solve this for myself, and I decided to open it up for free to the community.

It’s called Ratiocraft.

What it does:

* Smart Calculator: You put in your dose and method (V60, Aeropress, etc.), and it gives you the exact water weight and steps instantly.
* Digital Coffee Journal (For Registered Users): This is the big one. You can upload your coffee batches (photos of the bag, origin info) and rate them.
* Brew Logging: For every batch, you can log your daily brews. Take notes on taste, rate the cup, and record your variables.
* The Goal: To build a personal history of what you drank so you never buy bad coffee twice and—more importantly—so you can actually replicate that ""God Shot"" consistently instead of guessing.

Why I built it: I wanted something that looked clean, loaded fast, and worked right in the browser without needing to download an app store file.

I’d love your feedback: It’s still a work in progress (currently obsessing over adding ""Binocular Dripper"" tech), but I’d love to know if the logging flow feels intuitive to you.

(It’s my bday, but I’m a mom, so not really…)","Yes, I am conscious that I have a lot to be grateful for, and have a family many dream of. That said… I was raised in a family with a lot of dysfunction and trauma—and I’m the eldest daughter, so yeah. I also was abandoned with my first child, left for another woman with no warning and a ton of gaslighting (“I just can’t be with someone who’s become… a mother”—yes, that was the disgusting reason given to me, not the more direct admission of cheating), when my first was a few months old. Since then, I’ve overcome a lot of the trauma, or at least worked on it… I’ve remarried, we have a second. Our family is cool.

But… 

My youngest is 2 now and I’ve been asking for a break, a few days away alone (nothing fancy, well within our budget, and something I did regularly before this child), and haven’t had a single chance. Every time I plan for it, my plan is foiled—and it’s become clear that it’s because I am not the priority for anyone else. 

Today is my birthday. I have a cold. I’ve been sick for literally months, which is depressing on its own (trying to figure out wtf is going on there). My husband is a workaholic and lives his work life (founder, successful post-startup, but also entertainment industry and he does basically all of it himself) like he did before me and our kids. I’ve had to leave my career to keep our family afloat because of his hectic schedule, and I WANTED to… but now, I have lost ALL sense of self.

He told me last night that he and the kids planned to take me to breakfast at my favorite local spot in the am. Then, my kid complained so I said it’s fine we can go to this other place. This morning, I wake up and he says he doesn’t feel well (it’s an ongoing thing for him, not acute like my current cold), and drags…doesn’t get kids up, leaves it all to me to get kid ready and to school. Then I go to a coffee spot for one hour because I had no other plan for my day, and after he asks me to come get the toddler from him. Dumps kid with me and goes to work (he was supposed to have her all day because 1. It’s my bday, 2. I’m sick, and 3. I was supposed to be on that solo staycation, but didn’t because of kid being sick earlier in the week… but by default I should at least be left alone? No?). We had earlier in this week planned to go to a simple kid-friendly dinner to appease all for my bday. I didn’t mind picking my kids favorite spot (it’s Hawaiian not like Chuck E. Cheese), and I said it should be 5. Well… 5:45 he’s not home. I take my kids to dinner somewhere close and last minute. I leave them after eating and am now in my car writing this.

I don’t want to be an ungrateful miserable b\*\*\*\* but I also feel like no one gives a shit about me and it’s really upsetting. Looking for feedback or words of support. If you think I need constructive criticism please be gentle, because I’m frankly NOT okay right now/lately.

Feel free to post questions, of course there’s a lot more to the story.

as far as going out alone, i’m a very large person and people were very willing to harass me from their cars. not going to lie i wished i had something on me! i walked and i was worried about being followed home. Highly recommend if you plan on doing something like this in the burbs you go with someone else. The man i exchanged info with hung out with me for a while and it def died down a little while there were two of us for obvious reasons.

overall it was a very mixed experience but out here it feels like there’s not a lot you can do esp without reliable transportation. it cured me of my action paralysis i’ve been feeling. maybe try it and notify people who aren’t necessarily getting their info online! give it a shot if you see activity near by in person, on social media or [ https://iceout.org/en/ ](http://www.iceout.org)

The boat came all the way from Toronto, in the darker part of the night. Most of the perimeter was under heavy surveillance during the day, but since didn’t happen much in town for weeks, many watchers were taking things with ease, smoking and drinking. Black helicopters flew over the zone in the morning, afternoon and at night; military trucks and foot soldiers made their rounds on the exterior concrete wall that blocked the access to the town. Behind the ten feet concrete wall, a double metal fence, almost a giant cage, protected the area form the intervention of unauthorized scavengers.

There were a few attempts to get inside the zone, none of them with success. Most of the time, freelancer journalists tried to record videos to sell to the BBC or the CNN. There were curious idiots too, people who just tried it for the fun, or a dull sense of adventure. The last one happened five years ago, a guy jumped from a private airplane and landed in the middle of the forest. Nobody ever knew anything else from him, but rumors say he got a bullet or two in his stupid head.

There were a lot of signs in the route, a few big ones in the fence around the security entrance: “WARNING! PROCTECTED AREA. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS WILL BE PUNISH. STAY AWAY!”, signed by the U.S. Government. Some of them didn’t even allow to take pictures, record videos or stay near the security fence.

The only access possible was by the dock bay in the East.

Nobody ever tried it before. The waters were watched as well as the land. The team only saw one jet crossing the black water, with all its lights off, like a ghost boat.

A little light moved on the bay bridge, as some people walked across, keeping low. They moved fast, shadows between the overgrown bushes, away from the wooden bridge, as the boat, bare visible in the moon light, sailed swift toward the sea.

They were three and ran tight to a brick wall.

Above, a chopper crossed the dark sky. A black shadow cutting the stars.

 

 

**DAY ONE**

They waited until sunrise to start their secret tour.

They knew it could be dangerous other way. The whole town was abandoned two decades ago, and they imagined most of the infrastructure would be in stay of decay, so walking in the dark of the night, with just a pocket flashlight to guide you, was a 100% guarantee way of stepping into a crack in the concrete street and break an ankle. Anyway, they had an old map of Barton County, from the 72, but they were afraid it would be useless due probable geographical changes.

In other circumstances, Jaime would feel sleepy; watching the bright disc of the sun emerging from a horizon of dark trees and a giant concrete wall. But this weren’t those circumstances. He and his other two companions were drinking Brazilian coffee all morning, in the dark, and smoking, trying to not make so much noise.

Samantha recorded the sunset, shinning through the dark leaves. Mark was the cameraman, so she was using his camera, but that was okay. Samantha was the real boss in their little *crew.*

They were a real crew, the first brave voyagers in many years, walking the long forgotten streets in a dead town, the way NASA astronauts walked the Moon’s rocky surface for the first time. It was dark and desolated, like it should, but the yellow light soon crawled over streets, houses and lots of vegetation.

Soon, all was clear. The streets weren’t totally empty after all: Strange plants of giant leaves were invading most of the structures at sight. Over grown grass hid the main road; flowers and herbs grown from little cracks on the streets tiles; big deformed bushes in the front yards, blocked the sight of the street of little houses. Trees and more trees, every way. Ivy roots, the many black veins covering the faces of shops and public buildings, under layers of pink and green leaves.

Barton County was a desolated forest.

The team wondered around the main street, Harlem P., checking the state of everything. Mark’s camera registered every picture of the old town, each sentence of forgotten memory. The abandoned dinner, its windows full with dirt and its many empty chairs. Most of things still intact, even the United States flags over the empty counter.

“All right,” Samantha said after a long walking. “Mark, let’s get this started.”

Mark turned on the camera over his left shoulder. Jaime lifted the large microphone stick over Amanda’s head, ready to record everything she says.

“One-two, one-two,” she again. “Hello again, viewers. This is Samantha Dennis, and today we’re in Barton, in the state of Michigan. Myth and mystery surround this place, since a series of bizarre incidents occurred here in the 70’s. Nobody is allowed to live here, for authorities suspect there must be some kind of residual chemical in the air and in the ground.

“What happened here twelve years ago? Why nobody is living here anymore? And more important, what is the government hiding in this abandoned town, and for what reason?

“This is Samantha Dennis, for WWC News. Be around, for we may get some answers.”

“Annnnd cut!” said Mark.

A sudden cold breeze blown the yellow leaves off the dirty pavement. Samantha grabbed her arms, shaking, and looked around.

That night was cooler than death. Helicopters flew in the darkness, scanning the ground with their powerful lights. There was no way of making a fir, and get away with it.

The three of them hid inside a house. They were back to back, trying to warm their bodies, without success.

“So, you know what actually happened here?” asked Jaime.

“Some kind of alien invasion,” said Samantha, eyes locked in the darkness.

“For real? Aliens?” laughed Mark.

“Well, you could call it that way, if you want,” continued Jaime. “Reality: Nobody can say for sure. But the strongest rumor was that a group of people became crazy, and started attacking the rest of the population.”

“Some disease, I bet,” said Mark.

“Mmmm, not exactly,” resumed Jaime “This thing was a little stranger than a disease. Maybe even worst. Some of the attackers would develop deformities on their faces. Some even developed the ability of superhuman resistance. Nothing could stop them. No bullets or any kind of weapon.”

“Where you hear that?” asked Samantha, more as a joke.

“Just rumors…,” said Jaime. “Nothing official. There almost no information of whatever happened here, but it has to be something huge, you know? Something real serious and important, to force the army to watch this ghost town, in the middle of nowhere, for so many years.”

Mark lit himself a cigarette and kept silence for a while.

“You’re right, Jay,” he said at the end, looking away. “Something horrible happened here. A real nightmare. There are testimonies from people who lived here. Almost everybody survived, they just got away. The army helped them to get away, and some families where even relocated in others parts of the country. Some even got paid to say nothing to the news.

“But some people were so traumatized about it, they just couldn’t keep shut. They said the things they saw, the way people behave, like-- like monsters.”

“I heard something, too,” said Jaime. “There was a serial killer long ago. The «Crazy-Hammer Killer». He went out at night, and smashed people’s heads with a rusty hammer.”

“Fuck…,” exclaimed Mark.

“Michigan Police couldn’t catch him alive,” continued Jaime. “They shot him down. When they made an autopsy on him, they found out the size of his skull was twice bigger than a normal person, and that he was in an advanced state of decomposition. There were many theories of how he got that way…”

“Can you stop for a minute?!” Samantha asked. “Isn’t funny. We are here, after all.”

“Who’s scare now?” Mark teased her. “Don’t worry. Whatever crazy disease was out there, is all dead and mostly forgotten by now.”

 

**DAY TWO**

It was strange.

Mark noticed there was no wild life. No bird was singing at the morning sun; no wild dogs rumbling the land; no rats the size of a cats, running free through the grass; almost not insects either. Some flies and beetles, and that was much of it.

None of them was ever in ghost town before, but it was odd all the same.

During the day, the group had to walk close the trees line, avoiding the watch of the army men. Even in the evening, they had to be very careful of not being spotted, looking around, checking the skies, and stopping for time to time to look at the distance through the binoculars.

They passed the industry street. Square buildings, with their naked brick façade and long pipes, gave the sensation of ancient constructions. A few forgotten cargo trucks were consumed by rust and vegetation.

Samantha took a few pictures, using her camera with no flash. Most of the work of the day was to record as many images for the documentary as possible. No story time, no talking; just images.

 

**DAY THREE**

“Mark! Mark!” Samantha kept yelling in the forest “Can you hear me? Mark!”

“Sam, are you crazy?” Jaime whispered to her ear, grabbing her shoulder. “The soldiers may hear us.”

She pulled herself off his hand and glanced at him with concern.

“I don’t give a fuck if they hear me, Jay,” she said. “Mark is lost, and I don’t have any idea of where he could be in this fucking town.”

“I know!” Jaime said. “But maybe he is okay. Maybe he went alone, to record more scenes for the documentary.”

“No,” she whispered back to him. “No, that’s not true. He’s been lost since last night. Something may happen to him, and we need to find him before evening.”

“I understand, Sam. But if the soldiers catch us here, we don’t know what’s gonna happen to us. They can either put us in jail or shot us. You and Mark knew all the risks before getting in this place.

“We are trespassing a protected area without any authorization. And I don’t know what Mark did or where he is, but one of the rules was to stay together all the time. If he’s all right, and I really hope that to be the case, he’ll come back.”

“And then we’re leaving!” Samantha exclaimed through her teeth.

Around noon, Samantha got tired of walking and shouting Mark’s name, so both she and her sound technician stopped to rest in the front porch of a church.

Samantha black eyes were sad. She went quiet, looking at the distant shadows of the forest. The sky over the treetops was pale and the air cold. If Mark was alone out there, the rain would catch him by surprise.

She shuddered. What if Mark was already dead? What if a soldier on any of the choppers flying around shot him down?

Samantha wanted to keep searching for the cameraman, but Jaime told her it was better to wait inside the church. Outside, he said, more choppers than usual were flying over the area.

“Even now I can hear them,” he said. “Maybe they spotted us or something.”

“Maybe the spotted Mark!” she said. “C’mon, Jay. We need to find him. Tomorrow our rescue jet will arrive. We need to be together, before something bad happens”

Jaime sighted and looked outside through the dirty window. The giant lights beans where crossing the empty streets to and fro.

“What we gonna do, Jay?” Samantha demanded.

“Fuck!” Jaime said. “Let’s wait till the damn helicopters leave.”

Twenty minutes later they were out again, into the streets full with dry grass and the sound of emptiness, coming from each empty mouth on each building open door. There was, of course, no visibility of the streets around them, for it was dark. Samantha guided the way, using her little pocket flash-light, covering the lens with her fingers, in order to avoid letting to much light to show. Almost like a camera flash, she left some little ray of light touch whatever they have in front of them, then covered the lens immediately, and then she kept walking with those bits of information on her immediate memory.

Sometimes, while they walked, their tired feet would stumble with hard roots, rocks, trash or even part of Barton architectural anatomy, like wood steps or the edges of the pedestrian walking side. When they got inside the woods, Jaime grabbed her from the arm to stop her. He said her to look up, and she did.

The big concrete wall was no so far from there, maybe just 30 or 40 kilometers. Red and white lights shinned in the upper part, so it was visible at all times, no matter the weather or the hour of the day. Some tiny light moved horizontally in a steady peace, near the top of the wall. Those were cars, maybe military trucks, travelling from one point of the immense metal and concrete block to the other. Above, with their white flickers on top and on their tails, the black choppers were cutting the air, registering the insane jungle with their search lights. That was not all; two square lighthouses were helping them, using their strong spotlights.

“We better go the other way, uh?”

“Wait,” Samantha said. “They are not looking for us…”

“Oh, yes they are!” said Jaime. “And if we’re not careful, they gonna shot us.”

“Look!” she said, rising her finger and pointing at the wall, a hand none of them could see. “They are searching for something close to the wall. See? Really far from where we are.”

They both stood quiet, looking at the game of lights in the distant.

“Maybe it’s true,” Jaime whispered. “Maybe the lost somebody too.”

“No, they’re not calling for nobody,” Samantha explained. “They’re looking for something.”

“Like what?” asked Jaime, laughing.

“I don’t know”

They heard the crunching of dry leaves on their backs, and felt the rhythm of steps. They grow worried, for it could be a soldier, ready to shot them in the spot. Samantha, without thinking, left a bit of light escape through her fingers. Just enough to see two dirty sneakers approaching.

“Mark?” she whispered.

“Hey, man!” Jaime said, more joyful than his partner. “The hell you been? We were looking for you.”

And he approached, even in the invisibility of the dark, and his hand found a shoulder, which he squeezed it tight. Two green sparks glanced at him, like the eyes of a cat in an unlit room.

“We thought you were dead.”

Samantha let her flash light travel through Mark’s clothes. First the jeans, with some red leaves from bushes, and patches of dirt here and there, up to the shirt and the open olive-green vest. There were traces of something black on his shirt. Something that resembled coagulated blood. The light beam touched Mark’s face. It was him, but his skin was pale, even his lips. The intricate framework of his veins was visible in his forehead. His bulging eyes were white and dead, no memory of the man he used to be in there. His mouth was wide open like a black tunnel that leads to nowhere; a crimson-black jelly was leaking from his lower jaw, falling in a sticky line over his chin and chest.

Jaime, still over his colleague’s shoulder, trembled. But Mark grabbed that hand’s waist, with a strong. And before having any chance to resist, Mark’s head seemed to inflated on the sides. The white skin tensed, and little blood spots appeared in the center of his face, and those spots united in a red line. Then the white skin was torn, revealing a light layer of pinkish meat over the bulk of the skull. The skull was torn apart too, with a noisy crack, and between the vapors of blood, Jaime saw the shinning meat of the brain, covered in an intricate web of blue veins and red little arteries.

Samantha screamed, just like in the horror movies, but Jaime didn’t hear her. He even forgot his fear and worries. He was fascinated for the gruesome show developing before his eyes.

Just like petals on a flower, the sides of Mark’ skull remained apart. From the thick interior of the bone, deformed and sharp like razors, bloody bone triangles emerged. *Shark teeth*, Jaime thought. Then that monstrous mouth roared, smearing his face and glasses with blood.

It sounded like a monkey shriek.

\*\*\*

It was fast.

Samantha tried to follow them for a couple miles, but it was tough. All the way she heard Jaime screaming for help. There was no much she could do, running through the woods, avoiding smash against the trees or tripping overgrown bushes.

After a while, tired and feeling her feet about to crumble, she stopped to take a breath. She kept hearing Jaime pleads for help, but they were far away. That thing could run! Then she hurried again, but not so much she didn’t notice the terrain vanishing bellow her foot.

Her flashlight showed her a steep depression. Down the hill, a crystal lake, reflecting the pale bright of the moon and thousand of stars. Samantha could see the two black silhouettes, slightly touched by the white shine, entering in the mirror waters, perturbing its picture of the night sky, moving toward the center. It was still hard to see, but she could catch the glimpse of struggle between those two, and heard the inhuman shriek again.

“Jay!” she shouted from the bottom of her lungs, and using the little air available in her.

Already terrified for all she witnessed, Samantha felt an intense pain in her heart and some noise in her ears, when she saw something that had to be just an illusion, a byproduct of her mix of panic and lack of good sleep. But it didn’t matter how many times she blinked and smacked her own chicks, she kept seeing it.

The huge bump rose from the waters, in the same spot where the black forms of both her companions sank. She saw, it was clear now, Jaime coming down on his knees, screaming but without struggle, as if the microphone operator didn’t have a doubt he was over, and that whatever was coming out of the water, was going to rock his night real good.

A red flare came down toward the lake. All things were clear, painted in different degrees of bright red: The head-less Mark, grabbing his victim by the arm, not with his hand, no, but with something bloody and disgusting, that looked like a tentacle; Jaime, head down, covering his face with his free hand; that *thing* coming out of the dark waters, it was alive! The shinning huge mass was vibrating, boiling with hundred or so little meaty worms or slivers. And those little brilliant spots on the side, those had to be its eyes. It had eyes!

The flare must have been thrown by a soldier in the chopper flying over the hellish picture. Suddenly, it was like day time, for a powerful white spotlight eradicated almost all shadows around the lake. A furious round of bullets fallen over the obscene mass of slivers, breaking the night with its thunderous roar. Many shots impacted the monster and then it screamed. High pitched, like a seagull screech, but amplified in such way Samantha felt the air vibrating around her, shaking her clothes and skin, and making her eardrums to suffer.

Samantha covered her ears, trembling and crying, but she opened her eyes again. She watched the unveiled nightmare in front of her. No regards for Mark, a good friend, or for poor Jaime and his vast knowledge in horror flicks; they were done. She was deaf, but didn’t notice it. She was hearing the sound of the void, like the hissing wing before a storm.

First, the thing wasn’t anymore in the black lake. A rain felt over the rebellious waters, as a hundred of dark waves crashed to each other, in a frenzy for occupy the massive hole suddenly left behind. The thing was over the chopper. Better say, it was on one side of the chopper, like a bulging cancerous tumor, shinning wet and leaking, grabbing the metallic surface with its hundred of thick meat ropes, chocking the metal structure with their horrendous pressure. It reminded Samantha the giant squid embracing the Nautilus, in cover of her kids’ version of “20.000 Leagues Under the Seas”. The chopper tilted to one side, pushed probably by the excessive weight of the giant creature –it was way bigger than the little flying transport-, and the pilot made an effort to stabilize the vehicle. A couple white “arms” or crabs like hooks emerged from the monster’s body, and it used them to gain access to cabin, by breaking the crystal windshield. The chopper, still in over the lake, swayed side to side, maneuvering really close to the trees top, its metallic tale crossed by hundred of pulsating meat tentacles. The creature tried to grab hold of the top of the chopper, invading the rotator mast, getting tangled on the mechanism, and the tips of its many fingers were chopped off when they reached up the helices. But it didn’t give up. It used all its strength, and even if Samantha couldn’t hear it, the metal structure succumbed to the will of the army of bloody feelers, and collide somewhere behind the tree line.

All of a sudden, the night sky got illuminated by an intense orange light. Some of the long trees got caught by the fire.

Shaking and out strength, Samantha felt on her knees. She breathed heavy and deep, and that was the only thing that kept her from screaming. With eyes full of tears, she felt the strong desire to escape, or wake up, if all was just a weird dream, not matter how real it was. She got up again and walked slowly to the opposite direction, back to town, as her thoughts were numbed by confusion and violent images.

It was still night, but she could see the streets pretty well. On the other side of the road, there was a big fire burning an immense part of the woods, illuminating a good portion of the god’s forgotten town. She couldn’t hear crackle, but at least she could see streets pretty well on the orange bright, without the need of her flashlight.

Samantha didn’t want to think or even imagine what was that giant thing on the lake, whatever it was real or not, and what happened to her companions. Mark and the big documentary they were about to sell to the TV news channel. And for sure, she didn’t want to imagine why white flashes of light were crossing the orange glimpses of fire, as her long shadow went forward, like an arrow. And she didn’t want to predict what those strong vibrations on the ground were. Maybe bullets from the chopper. But the rhythm of the bumps wasn’t quite right. They were fast, but maintaining a good pace, like the footsteps of a runner. And those bumps were getting close.

She didn’t want to turn, but suddenly felt something flying over her head. The burst that came with it was so strong, that Samantha covered her head in a reflex, as it blows her hair and the wind elevated the dead leaves on the ground. It flew heavy but fast in straight line, before spinning to one side, and landed on a little house, a couple feet away from the road. Samantha stopped and trembling with panic, took a good look at whatever it was.

When the cloud of dust opened up, Samantha saw something black between the debris, covered in dust. For the still spinning propeller, with some of its blades bent, she realized it has to an army chopper. It rested on a side, the metal surface of cabin was wrinkled and folded, like a cardboard box in the trash; and its metal tail trapped in rolls of electrical street lines, pointing at sky. The fire started from under the metal hulk, resting on the broken ceiling of the house ground floor. It has to be the oil, leaking from somewhere, for the fire spread like water and consumed the overgrown grass and herbs in the yard. The pilot, wearing a black suit, tried desperately to get out of the chopper through the broken window of the side door, but he got stuck in the waistline, and regardless of how much he pushed, the fire spread all around, wrapping the metal cabin with flames. The man took off his helmet and screamed. Even if Samantha was deaf, she could tell the man was getting cook alive. His face was brilliant with sweat, and he was grabbing his hair in desperation. The muscle on his neck tensed as he showed his clenched teeth.

But this burning pilot, before the fire caught his suit, raised a finger as to show Samantha something. When man and fire became one, the black gloved hand remained where it was, pointing where to look.

Slowly, hesitating, she turned, just to take glance. Probably that was the reason the pilot was screaming, not the unbearable pain of being roasted alive.

What she saw at first, was a big dark balloon of meat. She felt it close, but it was too dark to see. Thanks to white spotlight from above (maybe another chopper), she could finally see it. Wet with some kind of oil, the reddish raw meat throbbed with millions of veins and arteries. Huge like a hill, smelled of rot. Samantha didn’t know why she didn’t smell its odor before. But there was more. That balloon of meat was actually standing; and army of bonny insect legs, or *clamps*, was holding the enormous size of the meat ball in place. It was like a crab and an octopus. And it had a head too. Samantha didn’t notice it at beginning, but then she saw the two pairs of big green eyes, insect like, in the upper part of the head, and the others, little bottoms of green crystal, in the middle. It was hard to notice, for the head was just another chunk of meat, but there was something like a pearl shell where the mouth should be.

Two strong and sticky meat tentacles seized Samantha arms and lifted her off the meadow. The upper green eyes went out of its face, unfolding at the end of two sticky blue insect arms, surrounded by larges feelers, thin like hair fibers. Those green orbs got around her head, checking her out, eyes without a glimpse of life. Samantha looked at her own horror grin in the polished shell of the pearl under the hellish face. An opening outlined in the middle of the giant pearl, as both parts slid to the sides, in rectangular sections like a mechanical box, showing a dark-blue passage that lead to a meat grinder. Hundred of white slivers vibrated; white structures like little bones unfolded, solid and articulated as the many long legs of some oceanic crab, showing weird shaped pliers at the end, closing and opening. At the end of that diabolic throat, to the sides, two little disk of bone, full with spikes, began to spin.

Before even thinking about what was going to happen next, or what the hell was that delirious devil, illuminated by the fire of Hell, all that shinning torture equipment of bone went closer, to the point she could notice the red arteries inside the blue meat.

Samantha didn’t hear herself scream.

  
THE END.

Now, I’m usually a friendly person, so I never thought I’d resent this part of parenthood so much. But when I’m out with my kids (and don’t have my husband with me), I am regularly getting boomers coming up to me and talking at me about whatever stream-of-consciousness parenting topics come up for them.

And they’re often teasing. Some recent examples:

“You sure have your hands full! HA HA HA” (I was pushing my toddler in his stroller and had our two small dogs on their leash looped around my hand. Everyone was chill as can be. This is in no way a stressful walk.)

“I want a ride! I want a ride!” (This has happened to me twice when I was pushing an empty stroller home after dropping my toddler off at daycare. Both times, a boomer dude (different dude each time) physically blocked my path on the sidewalk and said this. One time the guy pretended to climb in the stroller.)

“You know, I was HAPPY when I was a parent! You could look happy!” (This one I’m still confused about. My toddler and I were at a coffee shop and both enjoying our food. We were having a rare moment of quiet. We were both definitely at peace and just chilling. After this woman interrupted us, my toddler snapped out of his quiet spell and went back into full toddler mode and I didn’t get to enjoy any more of my coffee. Thanks, Karen.)

“Too many parents use those tablets today!” (My toddler and I were at a different coffee shop and I was drinking my coffee while my toddler looked at a book. We don’t use tablets. There was not a tablet in sight.)

“I heard you say his name. You should cut his hair so people don’t think he’s a girl.” (This happened in line at the grocery store. She then proceeded to vent at me about her ungrateful adult children.)

“He should have SOCKS on!” (I was wearing our baby at the store and it was probably 100° outside. She then lectured me on millennial parenting.)

“WHERE’S YOUR BABY??? HA HA HA” (This happened to me this evening when I was pushing an empty stroller to our daycare to pick up our toddler.)

It also always happens when I’m trapped in some way: either they’re blocking my stroller on the sidewalk of a busy street, or they’re standing over me at a coffee shop booth where I’d need to physically move them to get out, or we’re in line somewhere, or they’re blocking me from grabbing what I need at the store, etc.

This of course doesn’t happen if my husband is with us, or if I’m out without my kids.

It’s the strangest thing. I just don’t understand the impulse to start aggressively talking at somebody, who’s obviously busy, without so much as a “Hi, how’s your day going?” It feels like I’m being socially kidnapped.

I get that they’re lonely and I’m basically a sitting duck. But I’m an overstimulated mom with a full-time job and rare moments of peace. Entertaining or validating them cannot be my responsibility.

What does you say when this happens? I’m considering being completely rude and just naming how inappropriate the interaction is. Once I nearly said “I’m in the middle of playing with my son; do you need something from me?” but I panicked and just sat there.",4,1768531993.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

It’s a native WatchOS and iOS app built 100% in SwiftUI. The main goal was to visualize caffeine half life decay to help prioritize sleep.

The Stack:

SwiftUI for the interface.

SwiftData for local persistence (syncing this between Phone and Watch was an interesting challenge).

HealthKit integration to read/write caffeine data so it plays nice with other health apps.

WidgetKit for the Home Screen widgets. 

I’m currently a student hoping to break into the industry, so I’d love any feedback on the UI or thoughts on how you handle Watch connectivity!

So i recently purchased a nespresso vertuo pop + machine, and so far ive used a few pods nespresso has provided me with. heres the thing. I am NOT trying to spend that much money getting new nespresso pods, at least not every time I need to restock so i bought the refillable pod kit and right now I'm deciding on what type of ground espresso coffee to use. Chat has told me I shouldn't use super fine or coarse ground coffee for the sake of my machine, but I lowkey don't know where to start. I like my coffee dark, usually i make a double shot and the starbucks iced shaken espresso has been my drink since the very start (hence the nespresso machine purchase to save my wallet). Would Lavazza Qualita Rossa Ground Coffee Blend Bag, Espresso Medium Roast work? I reallyyy am not trying to ruin my machine lol.

So I got a text from my siblings to say “hey we are taking you out to get your birthday surprise in the morning so be ready at 8” 

So that morning I woke up, had a double shot coffee and some breakfast while I  got ready for my day out with my siblings. 

They get to mine and drive me to a coffee shop, their gift was a free coffee from this upmarket coffee place I love and a pastry. We would then head to the beach and people watch. 

I thanked them for the coffee but said I already had one and had eaten before I got here so wasn’t that hungry for a pastry, they got annoyed with the situation. I don’t drink chocolate drinks or tea so I couldn’t get a drink. 

I asked them why they didn’t just tell me what my gift was to negate this issue but they didn’t want to tell me as they wanted it to be a surprise.  I told them it was completely on them and they are in the wrong for not even hinting at my gift. I told them they could have said it was a caffeine related gift to still keep the surprise there but they just got more and more annoyed with the situation. 

I’m pretty sure I’m not the asshole but my mum also took their side so now idk.

Still, I would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.

**TL;DR:**

**I’m in a long-distance relationship where I feel I’m putting in much more effort than my boyfriend. He rarely initiates calls, replies late with short messages, and hasn’t kept his promise of regular video calls. This makes me feel emotionally neglected.**

**He had a long, intense relationship with his ex and, although they broke up due to toxicity, they are friends again and he even talked to her about me, which makes me uncomfortable. The way he talks about her and the fact that she’s close to his family makes me fear he still has unresolved feelings.**

**He recently changed plans and decided to move back to his home city instead of staying near his current city for a PhD, due to visa and financial concerns. This means we’ll be long-distance for at least six more months, and I’m afraid the distance and his ex’s proximity could lead him to leave me for her, especially due to the contact and closeness they still have (She has a tendency of contacting him a lot and he always responds).**

**I don’t think he’d cheat, but my insecurities are triggered by past experiences with an ex who wasn’t over his exes. I want to know if my fears are reasonable, how to manage my insecurity, and whether this relationship can realistically work. I am not sure if I am being way too needy, but I am definitely being extremely insecure.**

COMPLETE BACKGROUND:

Background about my bf: He was born in the same country as me, but has lived in a neighboring country for 10 years. His home city and current city are around 3 hours apart by car. He's currently doing his master's and works two shifts (7–11 a.m. and 6–10 p.m.). He also lives with relatives who rely on him for many errands, so he’s usually busy and tired. He met his ex while visiting his home city and they did long distance for around 4 years. He broke up with her due to toxicity in the relationship 3 years ago and blocked her everywhere. A fewmonths before I met him (this year) she contacted him through a friend and asked him if there was any possibility they could get back together and he refused. After that they became friends and she told him about the issues he had with her partner (I'm not sure if she's still dating this new guy). My bf says he only talks to her if she contacts him first.

About my relationship with my bf: We met late September while I was doing a semester abroad in his country. It started casually and later became official. He treated me well in small ways (like bringing me coffee), and we saw each other about once a week (more frequently toward the end), sometimes staying together until very late. However, there where some issues that where very frustrating to me: cancelling dates last minute,not returning calls, taking too long to respond to my texts, he also never properly asked me to be his gf, he just started introducing me as such and later asked if I was ok with it. I made effort to make sure he felt loved by helping him whenerver I could, but maybe I wasn't doing enough. We dated in person for around 3 months and have been doing long distance for 1 month.

Current situation: Long distance has been hard, sometimes he takes too long to answer texts and if he answers fast it's mostly short replies and I don't always like it when he turns the conversation into something sexual. He promised me we could do videocalls 3 times a week, so far it's been 4 times in the span of 5 weeks and I'm always the one that takes the initiative and ask him to call me. The first time we even had a fight because he didn't call me at the time we agreed and I had to call him and then the call ended abruptly because he ran out of battery. He promised he will take more initiative but hasn't done anything about it.

The issue with his ex: Whenever he talks about his ex iit feels like he still misses her. He has said he’ll never forget her, which I understand, but the way he talks about their past makes me feel like he loved her more than he will ever love me. He had told me that they facetimed and texted a lot, had dates, gave her flowers and he has never done those things for me. I understand he had more free time back then and she lived closer by, but it still makes me feel like he's making excuses for me. One time he posted me on my instagram and he told me she messaged him: ""Is that your new gf?"" and he talked to her about me, which made me feel a little uncomfortable.When I talk about my ex, I only mention behaviors that hurt me and that I don’t want repeated. A few weeks ago I asked him to not talk about his ex because I just keep comparing myself to her.

MAIN ISSUE: He had told me that after graduating this May he was going to move to another city in the same state to do his PhD and work. However, yesterday he told me he canceled those plans and will move back to his home city instead. He said it’s because he’s worried about renewing his permit (he’s not a permanent resident) and about money. This confused me because he’s lived there for 10 years and had been saving to become a permanent resident. I can somehow understand because laws in that country have become more strict regarding foreigners.

MY INSECURITY:I feel very anxious about him suddenly moving back, especially since I won’t graduate until December, meaning we’ll be apart for at least six more months. He has always said I could move with him after graduating, even before changing his plans. I don't think I am going to feel comfortable if his ex contacts him (she still lives in his home city) again, which could happen since she became close to his family. I don't think he will cheat on me but I feel like there is a high chance he could leave me for her because they would be able to have a normal relationship without the distance. He told me that when he was with her, he often asked her to “wait for him,” and it seems like she still wants him back. This triggers me deeply because my previous ex left me because he was never over his first ex and was secretly talking to another ex.

MY QUESTIONS:

Part of me still has hope that things might improve once he moves back to his city and has more time, but I feel very unsure about where this is going. Still, I want to try to make it work.",1,1768531027.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

1qe3s0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Careerflow/comments/1qe3s0f/10_chatgpt_prompts_that_actually_work_for/,10 ChatGPT Prompts That Actually Work for LinkedIn (Copy-Paste Ready),"Your LinkedIn profile is working for you 24/7—or against you. The difference often comes down to how well you've written your headline, summary, and experience sections. Most people struggle with these because writing about yourself is genuinely hard.

ChatGPT can help, but only if you give it the right prompts. Generic requests like ""write me a LinkedIn summary"" produce generic, unusable results. Here are 10 specific prompts that generate content you can actually use.

# The Right Way to Use These Prompts

Before copying these prompts, understand the approach: ChatGPT is a starting point, not a replacement for your voice. Take what it generates, then edit heavily to sound like you. The best results come when you provide specific context about your experience, industry, and goals.

# Profile Optimization Prompts

**1. LinkedIn Headline**

Your headline is the first thing people see—make it count.

```
Write 5 LinkedIn headline options for someone with the following background: [your current role], [years of experience], in [industry]. Include relevant keywords that recruiters search for. Each headline should communicate unique value, not just job title. Keep each under 120 characters.
```

**2. LinkedIn Summary/About Section**

This is your elevator pitch in written form.

```
Write a 150-word LinkedIn summary for a [your role] with [X years] of experience in [industry]. Include: my professional journey highlights, 3-4 key skills I want to be known for, what makes my approach unique, and a conversational but professional tone. Avoid clichés like ""passionate"" or ""results-driven.""
```

**3. Experience Section Bullets**

Transform job duties into accomplishments.

```
Rewrite these job responsibilities as achievement-focused LinkedIn bullets. Use strong action verbs, include quantified results where possible, and show the impact of my work. Current responsibilities: [paste your current bullets or job duties]. Role: [job title] at [company type].
```

# Networking & Outreach Prompts

**4. Connection Request Message**

Generic connection requests get ignored.

```
Write a 100-word LinkedIn connection request for [specific person's role] at [company/industry]. Context: [why you want to connect - shared interest, their content, mutual connection, etc.]. Make it personal, reference something specific about them, and suggest a clear reason for connecting. Avoid sounding salesy.
```

**5. Networking Icebreaker**

Starting conversations that lead somewhere.

```
Generate 3 conversation starters I can use when reaching out to [type of professional] on LinkedIn. Base these on: [recent industry news, a trend in their field, or their recent post/achievement]. Each should be under 100 words and end with a question that invites response.
```

**6. Mentorship Request**

Asking for guidance without being presumptuous.

```
Write a LinkedIn message requesting mentorship or an informational interview from [type of professional]. Keep it under 100 words. Include: why I admire their work specifically, what I hope to learn, acknowledgment of their time constraints, and flexibility on format (coffee chat, 15-min call, email exchange).
```

# Content Creation Prompts

**7. LinkedIn Post Ideas**

Building visibility through consistent posting.

```
Suggest 5 LinkedIn post ideas for someone in [your industry/role] who wants to establish thought leadership. Each idea should include: the hook (first line), the main insight or story angle, and a call-to-action. Focus on providing genuine value, not self-promotion.
```

**8. Writing a LinkedIn Post**

Turning an idea into an engaging post.

```
Write a LinkedIn post (under 200 words) about [specific topic or insight from your work]. Structure: attention-grabbing first line, brief context, the key insight or lesson, practical takeaway for readers. Include 3-5 relevant hashtags. Tone should be conversational and authentic, not corporate.
```

# Profile Enhancement Prompts

**9. Skills Section Optimization**

Identifying which skills to highlight.

```
Based on this resume/background [paste relevant details], identify the top 15 skills I should feature on my LinkedIn profile for [target role/industry]. Prioritize skills that: appear frequently in job postings, demonstrate unique value, and align with where I want my career to go.
```

**10. Full Profile Review**

Getting comprehensive optimization suggestions.

```
Review my LinkedIn profile sections and provide specific improvement recommendations. Current headline: [X]. Current summary: [X]. Target role: [X]. Target industry: [X]. For each section, tell me what's working, what's missing, and provide a rewritten version.
```

# Tips for Better Results

* **Be specific**: The more context you provide, the better the output
* **Iterate**: If the first result isn't right, refine your prompt and try again
* **Edit everything**: Never post AI-generated content without personalizing it
* **Add your voice**: Include personal anecdotes, specific numbers, and your actual perspective
* **Verify facts**: Don't let ChatGPT invent accomplishments or metrics

# The Bottom Line

ChatGPT accelerates the writing process—it doesn't replace the thinking process. Use these prompts to get past the blank page, then invest time making the content genuinely yours.

Excerpt from Chapter 8

""The smell of coffee and bacon drifted through Lionel’s Diner, mixing with the sound of morning chatter. Derek stirred his cup absently while Olivia Hale scanned the crowd from their corner booth, her badge clipped low enough to stay unnoticed.

“So,” she said, smirking over her cup. “Your mom’s got herself a boyfriend now?”

Derek laughed under his breath. “Yeah, I guess. She’s trying to play it cool, though. Pretending it’s nothing.”

“That’s good,” Olivia said. “After everything she’s been through, she deserves to exhale a little.”

For those who missed it or wanted a refresher, [here is the old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/1pztuu0/safe_deposit_box_bill_on_a_box_i_didnt_know/). First, though, a bit of storytime.

I had to get some car work done since it was a 4.5 hr drive each way, going up and down I-85 for a big chunk of it (IYKYK), and I'd put off my oil change for a while. This was all being done during my vacation, which I'd planned to use to actually chill out and unwind, maybe swing down the opposite direction to see my brother, but the box issue came up.

Of course, things got more complicated, since apparently my front axle was damaged, which would probably account for some of my steering and alignment issues, so that had to be done the next day. I also forgot my brakes were starting to become weak and shakey, but that's a problem for later.

I work second shift, and would've liked to stay on that sleep schedule, especially since I have insomnia and flexing my sleep time around makes it worse. But, I had to choose to either drive up, get a hotel, and then deal with it the following morning/afternoon, or just go daytime schedule and drive up and back in one day. Since the axle issue came up and was supposed to take most of the day (it was a lot quicker than the mechanic supervisor estimated, hmmm...), I just went 1st shift. Plus, if I still felt like it, I could more easily swing down and see my brother on that schedule.

So, earlier today, I got up, ate, tried to take a morning shit (delayed coffee for the road, big mistake), showered, and took off. Of course, that coffee I drank on the way made me want to drop a deuce less than an hour into the trip, but I held it until after the box was emptied. It was close, though; I almost didn't get the browns to the superbowl in time.

So, anyway, I arrive about 45 minutes early, baking brownies, and also hungry by now. And, it all went fairly smoothly; met the woman who I'd spoken to, she passed me off onto someone else since she had somewhere better to be, but he did his job well, and the driller arrived about 20 minutes early, too.

He gave me a copy of the box lease, >!and I did indeed sign it, way back in 2005; after seeing it, I did get some vague recollection of doing so,!< but I still never had the key.

Anyway, we go in, he grabs a teller since they have to inventory any stuff in the box, it gets drilled open easily enough, and we begin looking over the contents, as it wasn't empty.

And, ultimately, all that was in there was >!a bunch of insurance papers, most of which probably long since lapsed, multiple copies of my grandparents' death certificates, and some random junk papers. At best, it was sentimental value, but nothing of any financial value.!<

>!I assume that, since my mother died over 2 years ago, that even if she'd kept up with the payments, it's far too late to collect. My brother and I did get some money after she died, most of which went towards her cremation, so we probably already got what we could from them.!<

After that, I negotiated the release of chocoate hostages, and left. I ate at a restaurant before I left the area, the server was bad, so I left a bad tip (if she'd written my order down, maybe she'd have not messed it up). Then, made the trip back home. I really don't want to go back out on another trip after this one.

1qe3lej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qe3lej,"Just saw the vod with the Strawberry Shortcake toy, dead dad is relevant again lol","I know I'm hella late to the party, but while rewatching old vods because I've missed like a year of live streams (last one I caught, I was literally in labor with my third kid while wearing my Butthole Depression merch, dw it didn't get splashed lmao), and just caught the one where Papa Wub gifted the Strawberry Shortcake toy, sitting in my garage having a cigarette and a coffee escaping the mind numbing bs my toddlers like to watch (they learn words and counting and phonics n shit so its age appropriate, just boring and obnoxious to adults). 

While watching, hearing the story of the commercial Wubby had stuck in his head, seeing his excitement over the moving parts of the toy, and as someone who was a young girl around that point in time, the excitement is totally valid and gave me a form of nostalgia I NEVER expected from a Wubby stream. 

  
To explain part of the title, I put up the post about my dead dad watching the flight sim with me, after a decent chunk of my childhood was spent watching him playing flight simulator or having him try to teach me how to fly the planes before we lost him when I was 9. That was my post, hello again 😅

As for why he's relevant again, sitting right next to me while watching this stream is the last birthday present I ever received from him: the 2006 Polly Pocket party bus 😂 

I still love popping all the parts out and opening it right up, although I've lost the big part of the elevator that the dolls would clip into to move up and down, and I think the parts of the rope gate thing are in a drawer somewhere? The dance platform still works, each flower is a button that plays a different track for around 5 seconds or so, and they each change the speed of the lights blinking across the flowers too, I just forgot to pull it out and get photos of it running. 

This thing is my single most protected item of mine across every time I've moved house, because he KNEW how long I'd been wanting it, especially after I no longer had the pool party set I'd gotten when I was 4 (which was also fuckin sick, it had a little changing room that spun around with curtains like the strawberry shortcake closet, and the Polly doll that came with it had streaks of her hair turn pink in water, shit was awesome), he knew the two things I'd been wanting were either this bus or the barbie plane, but he knew I preferred Polly Pocket bc undiagnosed PICA kid, PICA kids know the deal with Polly Pocket clothes. No better mouth feel to chew on 🤣

He gave it to me for my 9th birthday in early 2007, just 4.5 months before we lost him. But even when they don't have THAT level of sentiment attached, they're fuckin incredible momentos from the past to hang onto, even if it was something you didn't have AS a kid, it was something popular WHEN you were a kid, which makes it special. I still want a Ben10 Omnitrix and beyblades 🤣

It is not weird to be an adult, even a man, and own or collect 'girls' kids toys from OUR childhood era. Shit was dope, man!! I'd love to track down some Ello sets for my daughter, those were my favourite early-mid 2000's non household name toy I ever had as a kid lmao. They were made as an attempt to get young girls into construction set toys, as if girls weren't already mad Lego fans 🤣 but the way the pieces could connect was so unique, if you're unfamiliar its definitely an older toy worth looking up, I've never seen another like it since.

1qe3jd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1qe3jd2/first_colonoscopy_endoscopy_miralax_gatorade/,"First colonoscopy + endoscopy, miralax + gatorade method","Hi all, I (37F) have been profusely searching this group over the past week (especially because I was nervous about not having done a low residue diet for multiple days before my procedure) and wanted to post about my experience if it helps someone else.  I did my first colonoscopy + endoscopy earlier today.

FWIW, I asked my Dr after the colonoscopy if she could see everything and get everything she wanted, and she said yes and that she would rate my preparation a 7 out of 10.

***Edited to add that I had multiple biopsies taken in both the endoscopy and colonoscopy to rule out bacteria/colitis. No polyps or removal of polyps.***

**Low Residue Diet:**

* My instructions did not *require* me to go 5 or even 3 days of low residue diet beforehand (except for day -1, see bullet below).  My instructions only said to start a low residue diet 3 days before the procedure if you are on a GLP-1, have had a poor colonoscopy prep in the past, or experience constipation.  None of those apply to me so on day -3 I ate some corn, crushed pecans, some seeds, and other things that aren't on the low residue diet, without thinking about it.  On day -2, I got nervous about this and decided to voluntarily implement a mostly low residue diet, except that I did eat some fatty bacon (most guides I saw said bacon is ok for low residue if cooked crisply but mine was not).
* For the day before my procedure (day -1) I was allowed to eat a low residue breakfast and lunch before 2pm. After 2pm, clear liquid diet only.  Thankfully, I was not required to go clear liquids all day.  At 7:45am, I ate two scrambled eggs, 1/2 plain bagel, and used 1/2 tbsp of butter total for cooking eggs and spreading on the bagel.  I also drank 8 oz black cold brew coffee.  At 1:30pm, I ate two servings of pasta (56g dry), with 1 cooked chicken breast, and used 1/2 tbsp of butter as ""sauce"" for the pasta.  I had a few tsps of vanilla ice cream, too.
* After 2pm on day -1, I drank mostly water and a couple of plain seltzers.  I had prepared a few kinds of jell-o just in case (lemon and island pineapple), but was not hungry/did not want to consume it.

**Preparation**:

* Day -1
   * 12pm: Take 10 mg dulcolax
   * 5pm: Mix 64 oz gatorade with entire 8.3 oz bottle of miralax and drink half the mixture, one 8 oz glass every 15 minutes, finishing no later than 7pm (two hours).
* Day 0
   * 5 hours before arrival time (5:15am for me): Drink remaining half of gatorade + miralax mixture, one 10 oz bottle of magnesium citrate with one 8 oz glass of water (mixed together or separate), and 250 mg gas-x pills.  My instructions again said to drink the gatorade mixture one 8 oz glass every 15 minutes and to finish this entire portion of the prep within two hours (7:15am for me).  I also drank an extra couple glasses of water
   * 3 hours before arrival time (7:15am for me) no more consumption of any liquids, including water.

**Experience**:

* The preparation did not make me feel nauseous and the gatorade just tasted like gatorade; not chalky at all.  My magnesium citrate was lemon flavored and it was so sour!  I did not have trouble drinking it.
* I finished both preps within 1 hour; each half of the gatorade mix was only 4 cups and I did not have trouble keeping on pace with the 1 glass every 15 minutes instruction.  My instructions did say that if you feel nauseous take a break and then resume, so if that had happened I would have had time to finish in the 2 hour window provided for each part of the prep.
* I did not experience any pain, bloating, or cramping going to the bathroom from the prep.  The mild discomfort I felt was being so full of liquid in my stomach from drinking the gatorade mixture and trying to drink as much water as I could beyond that to stay hydrated/help flush things out.
* For day -1 prep, it took a few hours after drinking gatorade for the prep to kick in.  I was able to go to sleep around 11:30pm.  By this time, my bathroom output was coming out yellow and clear. I woke up at 3:30am to go to the bathroom/had nerves.  I fell back asleep for a little bit but had set my alarm for 5am.
* On day 0, the prep kicked in as soon as I drank the first glass or two of the gatorade mix.  It started coming out a little darker and cloudy, but by 9am was back to being yellow and clear.
* I had to leave home at 9:40am for my 10:15am arrival time.  I was originally nervous about the trip, wondering if I would still be going to the bathroom at that time.  It had virtually finished by the time I needed to leave.  I used the bathroom once when I got to the hospital, but that was it.
* I received deep sedation with propofol.  I had never received anaesthesia before, so did not know what to expect.  Once they said they were starting the drip, I was out like mid-sentence.  There was no counting backwards or waiting for it to kick in for me!  I woke up back in my original bay room with a nurse rubbing my arm. Within 10 minutes of waking up, I felt clear, no headache, no drowsiness, no nausea.  I basically then got up and put my clothes on and walked out to wait for my escort, since I was not allowed to leave on my own (though I 100% could have).
* It is now 9pm in the evening, I have had no cramping, pain, bloating or anything.  As I also got an endoscopy, I wondered whether I would have a sore throat and I experienced nothing.  The second I was awake I started sipping water and eating snacks to tide myself over until I got home, where I had a slice of pizza to ease into eating, and then a warm brownie with ice cream an hour or two later.  I just ate dinner and had a mexican-seasoned ground turkey and some cooked veggies, plus a little cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.
* I am mostly just tired from how little sleep I got last night so now going to watch TV and go to bed!

**Preparation Advice Outside Instructions**

* The only thing I would add is to make sure you have some kind of soft butt wipes - I bought the flushable toddler ones from CVS, and they made my bathroom trips easy and painfree from chafing.",4,1768530167.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

At Bab Al Yemen I had a cappuccino and was asked if i wanted sugar. I don't like sugar in coffee, but it made me think that (given the high praise) for Bab that cappuccino wasn't the way to go here. So I will return and try something else. So feel free to rec.

Eventually one of the kids decides to climb up to this very high urban billboard to see for himself.

Considering the incentives these platforms have to extract money from paying users (men) and keep us on, is it ever justifiable to pay-to-play? Do those hidden likes miraculously all disappear?

Usually people would laugh it off, or say - yea, me too, who doesn't love coffee. But for me specifically coffee (not tea) impacts my energy and mental health very negatively. I don't know what it is specifically about coffee, but the negative symptoms start to accumulate if I consume it daily. I start waking up feeling tired and not being fully awake. I then start drinking coffee earlier in order to try and wake up. Then if daily consumption goes on, I start to sense that I am seeing everything through a fog and I experience a sensation of pressure in my head and ear fullness. I feel a sort of derealization, as if I am not an active participant in the surroundings.

The negative mental symptoms include the brain fog, increased intrusive thoughts (I have a diagnosis of OCD), anhedonia. I also get a restless feeling, as in I can't just sit down on my sofa and feel relaxed even for a minute. I feel a sense of urgency that something isn't going right, that I need to fix it, just not sure what that something is.

So this happened to me already multiple times, and each time I realized that it was coffee, then I would quit coffee for a period of time. I already bought and sold an espresso machine three times. Recently I was in a phrase of again consuming coffee daily, often twice a day. And again had a realization that my brain fog, depression, and OCD symptoms were worsening and the reason was likely due to coffee consumption. I quit drinking it again and I was correct, as my symptoms have now improved.

Quitting is definitely difficult for me, it feels as if something is missing from my day. I do drink tea daily and have no issues with it. I've quit caffeine completely previously for a long period, and I see no difference between consuming zero caffeine and consuming a few cups of tea a day. So since I enjoy tea, for me there was no benefit to quitting caffeine.

  
I have tried to find any research on specifically coffee and why it could be causing all of these negative mental health symptoms for some people, while the same people can consume tea without any problems. I haven't been able to find any. I'm very curious to know what compound in coffee makes this difference for me. Is it just the presence of l-theanine in tea? I occasionally have yerba mate though, which does not contain l-theanine, and I have never experienced brain fog or a crash from it.",1,1768529839.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

1qe36v0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qe36v0,"What’s Next on Higgsfield — a clear explanation (no hype, just facts)","A lot of people on here are wondering exactly what the “What’s Next” app on Higgsfield is and why it matters, so here’s a concise, expert breakdown based on how the feature works.


✅ **What “What’s Next” actually is**
What’s Next is a story continuation / scene idea generator built into the Higgsfield ecosystem.
It takes an existing image or scene and generates multiple possible narrative directions from it — basically suggesting “what could happen next” visually or conceptually. 

So unlike most Higgsfield apps that produce actual clips or stylized video outputs, What’s Next is more about world-building and narrative ideation.


This means it’s not a video generator by itself, but a creative exploration tool that helps you find directions to push into video or story content using other engines in the platform. 


🧠 **Why it’s significant (in tech terms)**
1) It’s creative scaffolding, not just output
Instead of generating a video straight away, it generates 8 different scene ideas from the same starting point — like an AI story brainstorm. That gives creators structured variation to iterate from, which most generative tools don’t do by default. 

2) Serves a different part of the pipeline
Higgsfield’s core strength is in video generation and cinematic motion — but narrative ideation is a separate problem. What’s Next fills that gap:
you generate story options
pick the ones you like
then run them through Higgsfield’s motion or video tools for production
That’s a workflow design pattern: ideate → generate → refine. 


3) Helps with consistency & direction
Creatives often struggle to stay on theme or keep continuity in short-form content. By generating multiple plausible follow-ups from a single image, What’s Next gives a conceptual roadmap rather than a single AI guess. That’s especially useful if you’re making serialized content. 


📌 **How it fits into Higgsfield’s ecosystem**
Higgsfield isn’t just one magic model — it has a suite of apps and tools that each solve parts of the creative problem:
cinematic motion engines
visual effects
character and face tools
ideation tools like What’s Next


The apps system is about modular creativity, not just prompting a single black-box model. What’s Next slots into the concept stage, helping you find interesting ways to use the rest of the tools. 


This modularity is one reason many creators prefer Higgsfield for short-form narrative content — you don’t just get a video output, you get steps that map to real creative workflows. 



🧩 TL;DR 
What’s Next generates multiple story continuation ideas from one image. 

It’s not a standalone video maker, but a creative ideation tool. 

You use it to pick directions before running video generation on Higgsfield’s core engines. 

It’s about structured creative output, not randomness. ",2,1768529243.0,HiggsfieldAI,0,1.0,False

1qe3614,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qe3614,Streetwear Essentials Lineup — Quick Breakdown,"I’ve broken down this batch to separate the aesthetic wins from the functional annoyances. Here is the honest truth about the fits and the flaws.



Supreme Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider\_token=482c](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider_token=482c)



The Verdict: A solid daily driver. The medium weight makes it versatile for different seasons, and the print clarity is on point.



The Catch: The ""Swish"" Factor. The material is noisy when you walk. Also, the main zipper feels cheap and tends to snag on the fabric if you zip it up too fast.



Stussy Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider\_token=8cfc](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider_token=8cfc)



The Verdict: Captures that effortless Stussy vibe. It’s breathable and the print is clean.



The Catch: Paper Thin. ""Light"" is an understatement—it’s very thin. You will likely need an undershirt. Also, the neck tag stitching is messy and scratches the back of your neck.



Ralph Lauren Socks



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider\_token=ae91](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider_token=ae91)



The Verdict: Initially, the knit feels dense and has good elasticity. They look great with low-top sneakers.



The Catch: Durability Issues. They shrank significantly after one trip through the dryer. Also, pilling (fuzz balls) appeared on the heels after just two wears.



Ralph Lauren Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider\_token=0cc0](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider_token=0cc0)



The Verdict: A classic staple. The knit texture is soft, and it really does look better the more you wear it.



The Catch: Sizing Roulette. It runs small. You definitely need to size up one or even two sizes. I also had to snip a few loose threads around the pony logo.



Carhartt Shorts



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: These nail the crisp, structured workwear look. The loose fit is perfect for a relaxed silhouette.



The Catch: Cardboard Fabric. They are incredibly stiff and rough against the skin until you wash them a few times. The buttonhole was also sewn so tight I struggled to button them.



Van Cleef & Arpels Necklace



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider\_token=316f](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider_token=316f)



The Verdict: Visually, it’s a winner. The metallic finish is clean and the clover details are refined, not gaudy.



The Catch: Feels Hollow. It lacks the weight of real gold/precious metal, feeling a bit ""toy-like"" in hand. The clasp is microscopic—good luck putting it on by yourself.



Carhartt Denim Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider\_token=af2b](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider_token=af2b)



The Verdict: A tank of a jacket. The structure is firm and gives you that boxy, stable workwear silhouette immediately.



The Catch: ""Fufu"" Smell. It arrived with a strong chemical odor that needed a heavy wash to remove. The rigid denim restricts arm movement until broken in.



Chrome Hearts Hoodie



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider\_token=3bde](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider_token=3bde)



The Verdict: Heavyweight and imposing. The sharp embroidery makes it a standout piece to anchor a street outfit.



The Catch: Heavy Hood & Fragile Zip. The hood is so heavy it pulls the collar into your throat. The dagger zipper pull feels delicate and gets stuck often.



Gallery Dept T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider\_token=3c34](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider_token=3c34)



The Verdict: The textured print and loose fit give off that cool, ""I don't care"" artist vibe.



The Catch: Uniform Distressing. The ""vintage wear"" looks too manufactured and identical, rather than natural. The paint splatter is thick rubber, creating a sweaty spot on your chest.



Stussy T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider\_token=15be](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider_token=15be)



The Verdict: The easiest shirt to style in this haul. Throw it on and go.



The Catch: Sheer Fabric. The white blank is slightly see-through in bright sunlight. Be careful with high-heat drying, as the print feels prone to cracking.



Balenciaga T-shirt



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: The cotton is very soft, and the print placement is accurate. It has that signature designer drape.



The Catch: Tent Sizing. Even for ""oversized,"" this is massive. Size down or you'll look like you're wearing a dress. The collar ribbing is weak and gets wavy easily.



Patagonia Hat



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider\_token=f6bb](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider_token=f6bb)



The Verdict: A clean, structured shape that works for hiking or coffee runs. The embroidery is neat.



The Catch: Shipping Damage. It wasn't shipped in a box, so it arrived flat as a pancake (needs steaming). It’s also a shallow fit—not great for big heads.",1,1768529181.0,CoutureReps,1,1.0,False

I recently received my Fellow Aiden (two days ago) and I’m looking for some help dialing it in. I’m a long-time V60 and Chemex user, and while I’m getting generally ""good"" cups with the Aiden, I am consistently getting a lingering bitter finish at the end of every sip—something I don't experience with my manual brews.

My current setup & variables:
Coffee: Light roast, washed process.
Ratio: 1:16.5
Water Temp: 90°C (194°F).
Grinders: * Single Cups: Pietro with Pro Brew burrs.
Batch Brews: DF54 with Ditting burrs.
Grind Size: Coarser than my V60 setting, and slightly coarser than my Chemex setting for batches.

Brew Settings:
Bloom: 1:30 minutes (based on what works well for my manual brews). Pulses: 2 pulses total.
Time between pulses: 1s.

What I’ve tried for Single Cups:
I’m currently running 2 pulses. I have the second pulse set to 88°C (with a 1-second drop-down) to try and mitigate over-extraction toward the end of the brew, but the bitterness persists.

The Issue:
Despite the lower temps, 1:16.5 ratio, and coarser grind, that bitter ""tail"" remains. The acidity and body are where I want them, but I can't seem to shake the astringency/bitterness on the finish.

Does anyone have experience with how the Aiden’s showerhead agitation or pulse timing might be causing this compared to a manual pour? Should I be looking at adjusting the bloom ratio or the number of pulses?

Did I handle this all wrong?,"We’ve been in a nanny share with our nanny since our son was 3 months old, and he’s now nearly 3 years old. The other kid in the share is almost exactly the same age and they’re the best of friends. They play all day and refer to each other as their favorite people. 

Our nanny seemed wonderful — she’s truly like a member of the family, having coffee with me in the mornings and gossiping and chatting about the news, buying big and beautiful Christmas and birthday presents for the boys, and so on. We pay her above market rate, on the books, and we give a generous Christmas bonus (even though we ourselves do not receive Christmas bonuses.) We give all federal holidays plus 20 vacation days (7 of her choosing) and unlimited sick leave, all fully paid. She has a teenage daughter who sometimes has a dance or a medical appointment or a school thing, and we’ve always let our nanny leave a couple hours early or take a discretionary day for that stuff as needed. 

Our nanny just had 2 weeks off over the Xmas period and then unfortunately after a couple days off we all got the flu. She was at the ER for a double ear infection and sinusitis, we were all in a bad way. She had to take a week off, which obviously was incredibly hard for us all to work through but we understood. Today she came back and we all thought we could finally relax back into the routine. She arrived here at 8.30am like she always does, and left soon after with the boys to take them to a nearby library that they go to often.

I did a morning of work and then, at lunchtime, I got an unexpected message. A parent in the local area’s WhatsApp group was asking if anyone knew my son. She connected me with someone who said they’d just witnessed something between my son and nanny and needed me to know.

I spoke to this woman on the phone and she described how my son had been crying all morning and she’d watch my nanny yell in his face to “stop crying” repeatedly. And then how she’d apparently dragged him by the neck of his coat through the library.

I was really shaken. I put on my coat and walked down to the library, where I found my son and his friend sitting with our nanny and some other nannies and kids. My son was whimpering and his face was streaked with tears. It was very different to how he usually is with our nanny: usually he loves her, runs up to hug her, can’t wait to see her etc. This time he ran and clung to me and I told her I’d had a disturbing phone call and came to check everything was ok. I told her what the woman had told me, and she immediately got very defensive. She told me that nothing like that had happened although she had told him to be quiet when he cried during nap time to not wake the other kids and that she had moved him from a quiet area quickly. The other nannies around started chiming in saying she’s a great nanny and she loves the kids and I responded that I know that, it didn’t sound at all like the kind and loving person she is. She then burst into tears and said that she was going to quit, that me arriving showed I didn’t trust her, that she has wanted to quit for a long time and that she talks about this all the time with the other parents in the share (which was quite hurtful, considering they’re friends.) She said that we have no structure for our son and no discipline because we didn’t sleep train, and her evidence for this was that when she arrives he often complains while we’re getting him dressed when really we should “lay down the law”. She said my son is difficult because he “cries all the time” and that she can’t deal with it. This was all completely out of the blue - we thought things were going fine.

I took my son home and said I think we all need to decompress, emotions are running high, my son has a bit of a cold anyway and she’s still on antibiotics from her infections so let’s just calm down and talk later. A couple hours later, she came back to my house with our share kid and essentially the same thing happened: she cried, said she was quitting, said this was “the last straw” (we were never aware there were any problems), and when the share parents came for their kid she left with them saying she wanted to talk to them. 

We later got a very generic message from the share parents saying it “sounded like we’d had a stressful day” and reiterating that they love our nanny and intend to keep her, “whatever happens between you”. 

My husband and I are so stunned and hurt. We thought of this woman as a member of our family. I guess I imagined when I went down there that she would be confused and laugh, or apologetic and want to prove she’s not like that. I didn’t imagine hearing her insult my parenting and having her quit on the spot.

At this point it’s incredibly hard to know whether she was just saying she wanted to quit out of emotion and what to do from here. While we talked to her, me and my husband both emphasised to her that we love and care for her. She said “the trust is gone forever” and that instead of “ambushing” her I should’ve texted or called, and she can’t forgive that. I tried to explain to her that as a mother I had anxiety for my child and it isn’t personal. But when she left, it felt like goodbye.

I’m just so sad and confused. We still have her lovely Christmas gift in the cupboard that she gave our son. We’d made all these plans (that she’d agreed to) to keep her on til September and then have him start school. The share kids are best friend and we thought we had a good thing going on.

I guess I’d just appreciate other people’s perspectives on this. Was I too rash? Have I just wrecked a 2.5 year relationship for nothing? This feels like both a betrayal and a heartbreak ",23,1768528231.0,NannyEmployers,47,0.85,False

Curious about tools that everyone uses that aren’t the ordinary ones like brushes, files, glue, etc. I’m talking about the weird things you use, the gadgets that other people might not think of. Or maybe brushes that you won’t find in the painting section of a store. Also I’d like to hear about tools that look sweet but are actually garbage, the ones on everyone’s social media ads that should be avoided!

Some of mine are:

Toothpicks, for adding little scratches or for mixing small amounts of paint 

Popsicle sticks, for larger mixing and building up thicker paint on bases

Cocktail toothpicks, the little confetti plastic bits on the end add a unique texture to bases

Coffee straws, for adding little drops of water, paint, or medium to a palette. Free at your local McDonald’s!

Nail polish brush! Gotta clean it real well, but the way they’re designed to fan out with little pressure has been nice for putting on base coats. And you can get a bottle of cheap polish for just a dollar or two. Plus the wide “handle” is nice.

We’ve been building quietly… Today, we're excited to share what we've been building.

MegPrime is a universal payments and rewards platform designed to turn everyday spending into real rewards, from coffee to rent.

We’ve received an SEC no-action letter confirming that the Division of Corporation Finance will not recommend enforcement action regarding the MP universal payments token.

Here’s why we took our time.

We operated in stealth-mode to meet regulatory requirements. We had to get the foundation right. Built with clear rules and compliance in mind.

Now we’re ready to share the payments and rewards platform we’ve been working on.

What does that mean for you? It means you earn by using MegPrime to live your normal life.

• Paying rent.

• Paying bills.

• Buying groceries.

That everyday spending is what unlocks rewards.

Welcome to MegPrime. Where your monthly spending starts working for you.

1. I use a Bialetti with Cafe Bustelo Espresso Grounds (it's what I can find at Walgreens lol but any recommendations for different espressos are greatly appreciated, especially if it makes the latte creamier).

2. I have a handheld milk frother from Every Dose Coffee, it spins very quickly and has two wire whisks at the end.

3. My roommate owns a Belville Nespresso Machine and she lets me use the milk steamer attached to it.

4. I prefer Oatmilk and typically purchase the Chobani Extra Creamy Oatmilk. Should I use a different milk to achieve a creamier, light latte/cappuccino? One thing to note is I'm allergic to nuts, soy, and coconut, so I can't use that milk.

5. I love when the milk froth is dry, but no matter how hard I try it usually turns out wet.

It had no comments.

It had no visible author.

Just a title:

NIGHT SHIFT RULES

I thought it was something the old moderators had done. I skimmed them:

1. Don't delete posts between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m.
2. Don't reply to private messages during that time.
3. If you see a post with no author, leave it.
4. Never look at the full edit log.

Below, a final line:

“If you don't understand a rule, don't ask.”

I smiled. Reddit was full of inside jokes. I left the post pinned and continued with my coffee.

At 3:07 a.m., a report came in.

A post with no author.

It just said:

“I’m here because you are.”

Rule 3 popped into my head. I hesitated for a few seconds… and deleted it.

Nothing happened.

At 3:12 a.m., another post appeared.

Same format. No author.

“That wasn’t it.”

I felt a knot in my stomach. I looked at the clock. Eighteen minutes remained.

I tried checking the edit log to see who posted that.

Breaking Rule 4.

The page took forever to load. Too long.

When it did, I didn't see any users.

I saw hours.

Dozens of entries were marked the same way:

3:17 a.m. — Rule ignored.

3:17 a.m. — User removed.

My name appeared at the end of the list.

The sound came afterward. A sharp thud on the floor. Then another one, closer.

New post. No author. Automatically pinned.

“You have five minutes to leave it.”

I tried to restore the deleted post. It didn't exist.

I tried to log out. Error.

I tried to shut down the computer.

The active user counter went from 1 to 2.

A private message appeared, even though Rule 2 said there shouldn't be any.

“It's okay.”

“We just replaced it.”

At 3:30 a.m., everything was back to normal.

The rules post was still pinned.

Now I had one more rule.

5. Don't break one rule to fix another.

My account was still active.

My history was clean.

But since that night, every time the night shift starts, the counter shows 2 active users.

My half brother who was only 14 months older than me developed Reactive Attatchment Disorder(a disorder that forms from childhood neglect and pressents itself a lot like Antisocial Personality Disorder) when he was a child. His biological mom would leave him alone for weeks at a time while he was still in diapers, when our dad went to get him to bring him to live with us, he was hiding behind a couch covered in his own feces, and his voice was gone from how much he had been screaming for his mother. He was five when our dad finally got full custody of him, and he was fine for a bit but he slowly started to become a monster. He did multiple things to harm our younger sibling and my mom like adding windex to their tea and coffee, trying to get them to run into the road, and choke them with things like lollipops and Legos. He trained our sibling to shoplift for him and if they didn't he would find a way to hurt her. He would beat our cats and play sadistic games with them. I'm saying all of this to explain our situation at the time. My mother was so stressed with trying to control him while our dad acted like nothing was happening.


My brother didn't really hurt me in the same way he hurt my mom or sibling though. I was easily persuaded and extremely gullible. I was a stickler for following the rules so he couldn't get me to steal for him, so instead he got me to do things like play too roughly with the cats or do things to make my sibling cry. He made me do things that I was too young to realize were wrong, I trusted him not to hurt me because I was naive. When I was around 8 or 9 years old he would get me to lie in his bed with him while he put on porn videos. I know they started off as regular pornhub videos, then stepsibling porn, then incest porn, then incest rape porn. I don't think he made me watch it often, and I can't remember if he touched me when we watched those videos. I'm almost 100% sure that he did more to me but I still don't have those memories. I also know that all of this went on until I was around 13 or 14. I still get a physical reaction to seeing him, and I don't know if it's because of the porn or something else but I get a physical reaction when I see my father as well. I also had a really bad problem with being hypersexual since as long as I can remember, I had multiple stuffed animals I would gyrate on. I would masturbate IN CLASS with my hands underneath my privates rocking back in forth until the end of 4th grade.



I'm a 21 year old transgender man (female to male), I've been on testosterone for around 3 years and that 2nd puberty has been hitting me like a bitch. I can't get off to anything other than incest roleplay and fake incest porn now. I have nightmares of my brother raping me while I'm begging for my dad to help me, but instead of helping me he joins in and instead of crying it starts to feel good. I wake up horny. I am absolutely disgusted with myself but I don't know what to do. If my brother hadn't shown me those things at such a young age I don't think I would be like this, but I'm struggling to blame him completely. He was a very traumatized kid, and now he acts like nothing ever happened between us. He hasn't done anything to harm any of us in around 6 years. What if what I remember isn't true? I really can't handle any of this anymore.",2,1768527131.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

1qe2du2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qe2du2/night_shift/,Night shift,"When I agreed to be a moderator, I thought the users would be the hardest part.

The reports.

The discussions.

The rules.

Nobody told me about the night shift.

The first early morning was quiet. Cold coffee, black screen, the reports queue almost empty. I felt ridiculous for having turned on all the lights on the floor. At 3:12 a.m., the first warning arrived.

\[AutoMod\] — Rule 4: Content removed.

Normally. I approved it without reading it. Then another one arrived. And another. Always Rule 4. Always from the same user.

A generic name. Too clean. No visible history.

I opened one out of curiosity.

The post was gone, but the text was still there, frozen in the log:

“I’m at work. I’m the only one awake. If anyone reads this, I’m not alone.”

I thought it was a joke. I closed the tab.

At 3:17 a.m., the screen flickered.

New report. Same user. Same rule.

This time the text was different.

“Don’t look at the active user counter.”

I looked at it without thinking.

1 active user.

Me.

The cursor froze, as if it were hesitating with me. I chuckled to myself. The sound bothered me. Too loud for an empty apartment.

Another warning.

“You already looked.”

I started sweating. Not from fear, I told myself. From exhaustion. From suggestion.

I tried to ban the user. The button wasn't responding. I refreshed the page.

Error 504.

When it came back, the counter showed 2 active users.

I felt something behind me. Not a noise. A change. Like when someone enters a room and the air becomes thick.

New message. It wasn't a report.

Moderator message.

It came from the same user.

“Don't break the rules. I didn't.”

I checked the entire history. Every deleted post complied with the rules. Technically.

There was no spam.

There were no insults.

There was no prohibited content.

Only short phrases. Always in the early morning. Always from new accounts that disappeared afterward.

“Night shift.”

“There's no one else.”

“If you close this, I'll continue.”

The counter went up to 3 active users.

I heard the building's elevator.

Then footsteps in the hallway.

I locked the community. I activated private mode. The counter dropped to 1.

I breathed a sigh of relief.

Then the last post appeared. Pinned. I hadn't pinned it.

\[MODERATION NOTICE\]

The author: my username.

I hadn't written it.

The text said:

“Rules exist so that someone will follow them when no one is looking.”

“The night shift isn't over.”

“Thanks for staying.”

The counter went up again.

2 active users.

I turned off the monitor. The reflection stayed there for another second.

When I turned it back on, the post had disappeared.

The community was normal.

The queue was empty.

In the moderation history, a new action:

User added as moderator.

Generic name. No avatar.

Time: 3:17 a.m.

Since then, every night at that time, the counter never drops below two.

And the rules…

Have you ever had a recurring nightmare?

It started at the same time as everything else. I can’t see, I can’t hear, I can’t even feel anything. That is anything except the hollow gnawing as beetles scurry through my insides, eating through whatever is left of me.

Yes, Beetles. Bizarre right?

More bizarre is that there’s no pain; just resignation. And then I hear a voice. It is the most beautiful voice in the world.

“Awaken,” she says. And then I am awake; the dream is over and the absence of sensation fades and I feel revulsion and horror. Is it really a nightmare if I’m only terrified after I wake up?

The thing that is most concerning to me is that I was rarely plagued by this dream near the start of all this, but for the past three weeks, it has been every night, and every night the last week the visceral horror upon awakening has become more and more pronounced. Last night for the first time I heard her voice again. “Protect what’s yours,” echoed in my ears after I sat up in bed and her voice was no longer warm and kind it was cold, harsh and imperial. I felt in my bones an implied threat, and I could not for the life of me understand why.

Lillian turned over next to me making a sleepy grumble, my abrupt awakening having once again disturbed her night’s rest. It wasn’t quite a full moon tonight, but there was still enough phosphorescence spilling through the window for me to make out the dim outline of her form, her face, her hair. God, I loved her so much in that moment. I love her so much right now, too. A righteous protective anger filled me and I knew, I *knew* that someone was trying to take her and the kids away from me. Hairs prickled on the nape of my neck. Someone was in the house. A strange sensation came over me it was as if I could feel him as he crept through the kitchen. It never occurred to me at that moment to wonder *why* I was suddenly possessed of this extra sense, but I trusted it implicitly.

Before I talk about what happened next, you’ll need to know more. More than just the dreams, some of the other strange things that have plagued me this past year.

So, it turns out I like eating mushrooms. Odd? Not particularly. But near the start of all of this, we had a Sunday family dinner which was tradition after I came back from my regular weekend hunting trips.

When the kids brought the plates over, Lillian and the kids had mushroom gravy over their steak and potato whilst I didn’t. I was confused by this as my mouth was watering looking at them. I stood up and took my plate over to the pot. Maggie the family dog had been strange since I’d gotten home so she was hiding behind the island bench. She yelped, showed me her teeth and fled to the living room. This was the beginning of her weird aggressive behavioural changes which lead to us having to put her down a few months ago.

I helped myself to some gravy which earned me expressions of incredulity from my family which I didn’t understand. I looked askance at Lilly and she gestured to the delicious looking pile of brown mushroom gravy now coating my steak and asked “Since when?”

I didn’t understand.

“Fungus is Fungus,” she quoted at me as if it was a phrase I should know. “If it could theoretically grow between my toes, it shouldn’t pass betwixt my lips!”

It sure sounded like something I would say, because I do love to sound smarter than I am, but I had no memory of disliking mushrooms or having any such personal saying. I was perturbed by this seeming gap in my memory, so I brushed it off saying something along the lines of people can change. As soon as I began eating I realised I was starving as if I hadn’t eaten in a long time and I enjoyed that steak and mushroom dinner immensely. Lillian looked at me strangely that night, and I’m sad to say that she has looked at me in the same manner many times since.

I wish I could say that she was the only one. People in the office would comment how I usually like my coffee bitter, but I *like* sugar in my coffee! I’ve always liked sugar in my coffee. That was of course before I lost my job. Accounting used to feel so easy you know? But all of a sudden it became harder and harder to make the numbers match up and investigate indiscrepancies. Before the last year I was on the fast track to management, but once I started making mistakes and losing clients they were forced to let me go.

It was shortly after I started spending more time at home that Maggie began exhibiting more aggressive behaviour. We tried months of dog training that we could no longer afford due to my difficulties in finding a new job, and yet nothing seemed to work. She had bitten me on five separate occasions before we had to put her down. Luke was old enough to know to steer clear of her if she was being aggressive, but we couldn’t take the risk that she would hurt little Mia.

I wasn’t sad when she went to sleep on that cold stainless-steel counter, which was strange. Maggie had always been my dog first and the family dog second, and yet I found no tears coming even as Lillian comforted the children. I think that day I saw Luke looking at me with hatred in his eyes, and that hurt me more than the death of a dumb animal ever could.

Last night I found my intruder in the living room crying in front of Maggie’s urn on the mantlepiece. I left the lights off but could somehow see him clearly in the dark. He was my height but there was something *wrong* about him. One moment he was a man wearing ragged and worn out hunting gear and the next moment he was a tall white furred figure with sweeping majestic antlers touching the roof.

“My Maggie,” I heard him whisper. “What did she do to you? What did *it* do to you? I’m so sorry.”

“Hey! Asshole!” I shouted as I turned on the lights, brandishing the once cherished hunting rifle I had not taken out in months. “Wrong house, Mother-Fu…” I was cut off in shock as I saw him in the light. He wasn’t just my height. He was *me*.

I could hear Lillian and the kids stirring at the noise. I knew whatever was going on, I had to handle this quickly in order to keep them safe, but he, me, *other me* rushed me and pushed the rifle to the ground. I hesitated and he was able to disarm me handily. He should not have been able to do that. I was a veteran. I knew how to fight.

“Sticks!” he growled as he pushed me up against the wall, his forearm jammed into my neck making it difficult to breathe. Even in the incandescent light of the electric lamp I had turned on, to my eyes he would switch from a clone of me to some bestial furred antlered creature with my face. “You were nothing more than a pile of sticks! I Watched her *make* you!”

And for a moment my heart stopped. There was something fundamentally *true* in his words that I didn’t understand. I still don’t.

“Protect what’s yours.” The voice came again as if from the very air itself. I know he heard it too because he released his hold on me and whirred around the room trying to pinpoint the sound.

“A year and a day I gave you! The price I paid! He has no right to be here! No *right*!” his eyes glowed with some unearthly power. I knew what I had to do. Protect what was mine. I eyed the rifle on the ground.

“Evan!” called Lillian from upstairs. “I’m calling the police!”

All the fight went out of my doppleganger, and he deflatedly breathed my wife’s name. “Lillian.” He took what appeared to be an involuntary step towards the stairs.

That was the straw that broke me. She was *my* wife. This was *my* family. *My* house. I lunged for the rifle, but he was faster. He dived so my shot only winged him, and then he plunged through the window. The way he moved was so sleek, so efficient like the deer I used to hunt when I still cared for it. My aim isn’t what it used to be and my second shot went wide.

“Evan!” screamed Lillian and she came rushing downstairs into my arms. I held her with one arm as I held the rifle in the other.

“It’s okay honey. Shhh. He’s gone now”

I stared out the shattered window into the night, waiting for the police to arrive wondering what I was going to tell them.

Sticks, he said. A pile of sticks.

The memory of beetles gnawing through my inside made me shudder.
