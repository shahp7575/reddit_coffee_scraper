1hp1ti5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarKid/comments/1hp1ti5/ranking_starkid_and_tin_can_bros_villain_songs/,Ranking Starkid and Tin Can Bros Villain Songs ,"Few things 

Some of my choices are a lil weird so… lemme explain 

I consider a villain song to be a song by or about the villain where villainous acts are done or villainous traits are revealed, so here are songs you may be wondering about

Land of the Dicks, in (song where the penises trick Dick) 

Orphaned at 33, Take off your clothes, In (Aladdin is trying to trick and seduce a teenage girl) 

Somebody’s Gotta do it, In (fun lil diddy but the deadliest man is evil in it nonetheless) 

The Night Belongs to Snarl, The Blinky Song, the Nibbly Diddy, Axe Man, in (it’s about how evil the villain is, Econ if the villain doesn’t sing) 

Our Doors are Open, in (frank is kinda a villain imo, and has villainous intentions in this song) 

Bury the Bully, in (even before the end, grace being a villain can be argued, and dismembering and hiding a body is some villainous shit) 

Witch in the Web, out (talks about the villain but not about how evil she is, just how to avoid her) 

Latte Hatte, Out (Zoe is a villain but she does nothing villainous in the song)

Dirty Girl, Out (two villains, but not doing villainous shit) 

Hatchet Town, Out (unlike feast of famine, which is In, the townspeople aren’t really being villainous, just paranoid) 

With that out of the way, don’t kill me for my picks 

57: Caulk the Wagon (the only song I dislike in TTO. (you gotta go slaps btw y’all, fight me) it’s gross and not fun to balance it out, like dirty girl) 

56: Land of the Dicks (I’m not a big fan of MAMD because I rarely think dick and pussy jokes are funny and land of the dicks is just a pretty lame song in my opinion) 

55: Let Him Come (kinda a bop, but too short to ever come back to it) 

54: Killer Track (the perfect representation of what non metal fans (aka me) think metal is, and I’m sure metal fans can get some enjoyment out of it, but I don’t like metal music unfortunately so that’s on me) 

53: What do you Want Paul? (fun song but the jerking off part isn’t funny past the second listen and slows down the song and play on re-listens) 

52: You Tied up my Heart (I enjoy the vibe but the Jeff Blim falsetto I usually love goes a little flat here and doesn’t really work with the style of the song imo) 

51: Not So Bad (Reprise) (ok song but not as good or fun as others and the nazi thing bugs me a little) 

50: Not So Bad (same problems but a little more fun) 

49: Different (first starkid villain songs, and I like it, but it’s not as fun in subsequent viewings, and there are other, better songs) 

48: Bury the Bully (I like it, and the harmonies make me happy, and to be honest I don’t have much downsides, most starkid songs slap) 

47: Take Off Your Clothes (a silly song that shows off Aladdin’s sinister side, and at this point just assume it’s lower cause I like the other ones more) 

46: Tickle Me Wiggly Jingle (catchy Song but I wish the “do the wiggle” part was either longer or cut out cause I think it was too short) 

45: Different (Reprise) (yeah I like the reprise more, fight me bitch. I like the harmony more, and I think it’s a little funnier)

44: Orphaned at 33 (good song to show off Aladdin‘s incompetence, and self-absorption)

43: Get in my Mouth (I like it more than most people apparently. It’s a fun little song, but somebody called it “kick it down a notch” one time and I’ve never fully recovered.) 

42: I Steal Everything (our first introduction to Aladdin, and it works very well to show what type of character he is. It’s upbeat, reminiscent of one jump ahead, and a good character analysis)

41: Adore Me (a good way to show Linda’s character, and a catchy tune. Man, a lot of these reviews are about to sound the same. I just really like villain songs man)

40: The Golden Rule (Evil Reprise) (takes one of Jafar‘s best lines from the original movie and turns it into a fun little song that plays off of Jafar‘s earlier song. At first, I didn’t even realize they were saying, follow the gold and rule until I turned on the captions) 

39: Cup of Roasted Coffee (this and it’s follow up are my friends favorite starkid songs of all time, and I don’t blame them. The harmonies make me feel some kind of way)

38: The Nibbly Diddy (I don’t know why so many people dislike this song. It’s just fun to me. It works with the other sniggle songs as well)

37: The Blinky Song (I also quite like this song. Kurt, James and Jeff were perfectly silly, and the song itself is pretty catchy. I find myself humming it from time to time)

36: Stutter (honestly a little overrated. I like the song, and Joe is a masterpiece of a man, but to be honest while I like the song, it’s not one of the best of the show. Still, it’s catchy and a fun time every time)

35: Dirty Dudes Must Die (I don’t have much to say about this song, but I can’t say that the “darkness will spare my soul” part makes me have a little eargasm every time) 

34: Kick it Up A Notch (Reprise) (I think Junior deserved his own solo, but this reprise is nice, and silly. Yeah, guys, I’m smoking pot) 

33: Cup of Poisoned Coffee (I like it a little more than the first song because of the part you’re all thinking about right now “ hey Mr. business, how do you, how do you, how do you do?”)

32: Big T’s Temptation (I know I said I don’t really like dick jokes, but I think they’re actually kind of funny in this song, and the jazzy instrumental along with Cory‘s voice makes me a happy happy man)

31: Do You Want to Play? (Somebody described Kim Whalen‘s voice in this song as an evil Disney princess, and that makes sense. She has a pretty voice, but it works for a creepy song like this)

30: The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals (a very strong opening number to a musical full of villain songs. Also, sorry for how high most of hatchet field is going to be, they just have more villain songs than most other SK musicals, and I generally like the musical writing style of Jeff Blum more than other starkid songwriters TBH)

29: Show Stoppin Number (still a very good song, even though it’s not my favorite in TGWDLM anymore. I do hate Robert Manion, though, like any sane person would)

28: No One Remembers Achmed (also a little overrated, but still fun as hell)

27: Somebody’s Gotta Do It (the happiest villain song I’ve ever seen. He just loves killing people)

26: The Night Belongs To Snarl (I need somebody who loves me as much as these cave people fear snarl. The Melodys make me happy, and Brian leading and ending the song is good) 

25: Rouges Are We (a good song to introduce the rogue’s gallery, and a song I sing along to whenever I hear it)

24: America is Great Again (I like how in the stage version you can hear exactly when the audience got the joke)

23: To Dance Again (never mind guys, this is the happiest villain song)

22: Lah Dee Dah Dah Day (amazing performance for Mariah‘s first lead song)

21: Made in America (Joey as a villain will never not be amazing (even if his hero characters are always adorable))

20: Not Your Seed (a perfect emotional song to compel Bill to end himself)

19: Inevitable (an undoubtedly, fun song that makes everybody immediately stop smiling as soon as they hear the first note. It’s also a really good medley of almost all of the songs before) 

18: One Step Ahead (one of the most emotional songs from either company. Watching two lovers do get out while one of them is trying to effectively end the world? My eyes are watering already)

17: Rouges Are We (Reprise) (jeff’s first ever starkid song, and it’s lovely. They do in fact, rise up like a natural disaster)

16: Show Me Your Hands (a funny, jazz hand joke, and a legit good commentary on corrupt cops, and as much as I hate Robert Manion, him wailing like a siren is some absolutely funny shit)

15: Nerdy Prudes Must Die (WHO WILL PRAY FOR YOU?!) 

14: Wiggle (you can tell that by this point this is become more than a way for Linda to be adored. She genuinely believes this, and so does everybody else. That’s what makes it so scary. Everyone believes this and they’re willing to do anything to make sure wiggly is birthed)

13: The Summoning (it’s kind of slow at first, and I’ll admit that the first time I was watching it, I was kind of pulling away, and then… “Hello Fwendie Wends” and holy shit! You have this colorful, crazy circus type song where the Lord’s in Black tell Stephanie to shoot Pete, and I get hype every time)

12: Our Doors Are Open (Corey needs more solos. That’s it. That’s the end of the explanation)

11: The Torture Tango (reprising three of the songs that came before to show what the characters were thinking is great, and I love Joe Walkers performance and singing. This is actually one of the few times I enjoy Joe Walker’s singing for his singing. Usually, it’s his performance that carries his songs.)

We’re up to the top 10 guys. Let’s go. 

10: Guys Like Potter (Lucius was amazing, the only time Joe Moses got to sing a solo part was also pretty good, and the duet part made me feel like the world was good again)

9: Join Us (and Die) (the chorus is creepy, Jaime Lynn Beattie‘s singing is immaculate, and she’s gonna fucking kick your ass)

8: Literal Monster (the start is set up to revealing Max, and it works well because it’s sung by people who are victims of Max, and then afterwards Max gets a solo part where Will Branner makes his debut as a star kid in an amazing way. This song kills me every time, and I think the football players dance moves are so dumb that it goes back around to being absolutely hilarious)

7: Virginity Rocks (yes this is a villain song. It’s sung by the villains, and it’s sung for the purposes of making children fear sexual relationships. Anyway, it slaps. Jon has improved so much since 2018, and this is proof of that. Pairing him with Kim was an amazing choice)

6: Wagon On Fire (just like inevitable, this song reprises the songs before it and does it in an amazing way. It’s also another Joey villain song, which makes the world turn)

5: Let it Out (Jon’s first time singing, but this song isn’t this high, just for his singing, that and the rest of the musical parts of the song, would’ve put it pretty high alone, but it’s Paul’s expressions that make this one. Jon is a very talented actor, and his facial expressions were amazing, impeccable, immaculate)

4: Axe Man (Corey and Bryce kill this one. I don’t have much to say about it other than that)

3: Feast Or Famine (star kid does ensemble songs extremely well, and this is definitely one of their best. And as somebody who’s directed a musical before, the blocking on this number is incredible. It has to be organized in a way that makes everything perfect, but also looked like an unorganized mess)

2: Not Over Yet (Lucius is fabulous. This song is great, I’ve got nothing else to say)

1: kick it up a notch (I knew this was going to be number one, you knew this was going to be number one, why are we pretending at this point. I don’t need to explain myself to you)

I mostly just enjoy other’s stories and benefit from advice shared in this sub 

I may be at my breaking point with my 6 year old son. I’m trying not to be and I think that I’ve always handled things calmly which has led to me getting a 2 time ‘father of the year’ award coffee mug at Christmas but I’m starting to have a hard time distinguishing between being ‘just a boy’ and ‘uncomfortably wild’ in my son.

He’s always been shy and reserved around people he doesn’t know and full of energy around people that he does. Here lately, however, his normal bountiful supply of energy has been kicked up into overdrive into what I would consider an ‘in your face, you have become my playpin’ kind of behavior. 

I had convinced myself that it was normal behavior for boys in his age group until I sat back and observed him interacting with some of his peers in the neighborhood. It was then that I became self-aware that ‘shit…my son is ‘that’ kid…’ 

I tried to sit him down and have a serious discussion about controlling your impulses around other kids and adults that may not be familiar with his particular style of playing but but not much was heard because he was turning into a Rollie-Pollie and tumbling down my lap and across the couch about 4 seconds in 

I think part of the problem is that he looks bigger and older than he is, something I dealt with too, so whereas he can easily fit in with boys who are 8 or 9 years old I have to constantly remind myself that he isn’t 8 or 9. By the same token, he isn’t 4 anymore either so when he bounces out this last bit of toddler left in him it becomes a bit more jarring because he’s larger and older and isn’t as cute as when a 4 year old is giving their parents hell in the grocery store 

I guess what I’m asking/venting about is: how do I reframe the way I see his behavior so I can savor the last little bit of innocent toddler he has left in him while not letting him lose complete control and be unstoppable once he is 8 or 9? ",1,1735495561.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

So here we go..

As planned we met on Saturday at our college cafeteria as we don't have each other's contact I didn't knew at what time she'll reach there so as our college starts at 11:00 so I reached there at 10:30 sitting in the cafeteria while my friends sitting on the other corner.

She walks in the cafeteria looking finer than she has ever been... She didn't saw me so I just waved in her direction to get her sight and she comes and sit normal greetings and i asked her if she wanted something I bought coffee for ourselves (she paid for hers) she directly comes to the point.
(The conversation is in dialogue form for the ease of readers)
(The convo took place in english so most of these are the actual things that I told and even hers)

She : So what were my pics doing in your phone?
Me: See once I told one of my friends that you look really beautiful, you're looking even more today (flirt kardiya) so for teasing me he sent me your pics. Nothing else 
She: Is this it? Really? (With a very intimidating suspicious look) (God she was looking so hot at that time)
Me: Yeah this is it.
She: Sagar do you really think I'm dumb?
Me: No why would I?
She: No I think you do. Girls have a sixth sense you know? We know if a guy likes us or is interested in us and I know that you like me why don't you just accept it.

(At this point mere dimag ke bhosde khul chuke h)

Me: Yeah I do but I didn't knew how would you react to it whether if I would have confessed it.
She: You're you stupid Sagar (with a slight laugh)
Me: Why?
She: I gave you signals but you didn't seem to receive them very well.
Me: Yeah I'm not good at this.
She: I kinda like you too but I can't afford to take it forward before knowing somethings about you

(Now I'm dying with happiness from inside)

Me: Yeah ask whatever you want
She: what's your surname?
Me: (At this point I knew where this is going)
I replied with my surname.
She: (with a pchh) Sorry we can't take this forward you're a brahman and I'm not.
Me: (shit) Fuck it man, I knew this would happen that's why I didn't want to talk to you about this before knowing your surname cause even I want a brahman girl cuz my parents won't accept anything else.
She: yeah even mine won't accept 
Me: Yeah, so what we gonna do now?
She: nothing, but we can be friends if you promise to don't have any feelings for me.
Me: yeah sure ( I literally don't have any feelings now )
Me: Btw you're looking really hot today.
She: Shut up (with a shy smile)

She was getting late for her classes so she left and even I left.

Saal kuch acche tarike se khatam hua atleast ab itna to pata h ki we don't have any future so no point in having a crush on her

This will be built out in the country, outside of the GTA but fairly close (think more KW country). The idea was more open concept + conversion of the ""formal living room"" into a parents en-suite for my wife and I as we grow older.

We will be the GC and managing this entire build ourselves.

Goal is a Modern French chateau type of look as seen in the inspiration pictures at the bottom
House is 4.2k sqf, can be brought in under 4k if we bring in the wall on the right side of the house by 2-3ft.

Notes of major revision changes we will making:

**Main Floor**

* Move 1/2 bath door to open from Foyer

* Remove storage closets in office/Mudroom, convert to hallway so you can enter office from kitchen as well

* Move the Foyer closet to the opposite side, allowing for open concept when your coming down the stairs (so removing the wall/closet entirely)

* Add opening to right side of fridge, so you walk from mudroom into the kitchen

* Close the butler pantry and make it one large wall for a kitchen hutch, cabinetry, coffee bar etc.

* Laundry Room: Flip the washer/dryer/sink to opposite wall

**Second Floor**

* Remove main corridor separation wall bit to allow a more flush hallway

* Sliding door for linen closet

* Primary bedroom: Remove the closet, add powder counter, Extend the washroom to be longer, shrink the WIC as it's fairly wide

* Unfinished Loft Space: There's a weird L shape that boarders onto the primary bedroom, we thought of raising the roof and opening that up to a private balcony entrance from the Primary bedroom. Private area for a coffee, reading a book etc.

**Back of House**

* Covered Patio is supposed to be roof or higher raised gazebo (this was a mistake on the revision plan). This was the [objective covered patio design](https://www.getcircled.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cd3.webp). Although, I don't know how well that flows with the inspiration pictures we're are going for

* Add balcony from Primary Bedroom

* Raise the roof so it's more symmetrical where the Primary Bedroom/Unfinished Loft would be (this adds a private balcony as well)

* Move the garage door inwards toward the kitchen slightly to allow for more open patio space


**Considerations**

* Do we really need a WIC in the formal living room? That's dead space and i'm not sure how to utilize it in-between the transition of living room > formal ensuite.


These are just some major revision changes we'll be making and appreciate this subs input. Lots of people have provided great advice in the past 2 posts, look forward to hearing more thoughts and criticisms of the plan!

Hey Reddit fam! 👋 Let’s talk oral hygiene—specifically about upping your game with a **teeth polisher**. If you’ve ever wanted that just-left-the-dentist clean feeling at home, this one’s for you. Today, I’m diving into the [**AquaSonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush**](https://geni.us/gXPTfZT), which is more than just a toothbrush—it’s basically a personal teeth polisher in your bathroom.

## What Is a Teeth Polisher, Anyway? 🦷✨

First things first, what do we mean by “teeth polisher”? While a traditional toothbrush focuses on removing plaque and maintaining oral hygiene, a polisher takes it a step further by smoothing your teeth and helping remove surface stains. Think of it as the difference between sweeping your floor and giving it a good scrub-and-shine.

The AquaSonic Black Series, with its **40,000 VPM (vibrations per minute) motor**, isn’t your average electric toothbrush. It’s designed to polish and whiten your teeth, leaving them not only clean but also smooth and shiny.

## Why I Made the Switch to the AquaSonic Black Series 🖤

I’ll be honest—I used to think electric toothbrushes were overhyped. But after hearing my dentist go on (and on) about how much better they are at plaque removal and gum health, I finally caved. The AquaSonic Black Series stood out because:

* **It’s ADA Accepted:** That’s a big deal. The American Dental Association’s seal means this toothbrush actually delivers on its promises.
* **It Comes With 8 Brush Heads:** No need to worry about replacements anytime soon. That’s a year or more of brushing right there.
* **Multiple Modes:** With 4 modes, including one specifically for polishing, it’s like having a professional-grade teeth cleaner in your hands.

## What It’s Like to Use the AquaSonic Black Series 🚀

Here’s how my routine looks now:

1. Choose the **Polish Mode** on the AquaSonic. This mode is designed to smooth your enamel and brighten your teeth.
2. Let the smart timer guide me—2 minutes total, 30 seconds for each quadrant of my mouth.
3. Sit back and enjoy that post-brush polished feeling.

The first time I used it, I literally ran my tongue over my teeth and was blown away. It felt like my dentist had just given me one of those deep cleans. Over a couple of weeks, I started noticing my teeth looked shinier and my coffee stains were less visible.

## What Makes the AquaSonic a Standout Teeth Polisher?

* **Advanced Electric Motor:** The 40,000 vibrations per minute don’t just clean your teeth; they polish them. It’s gentle but effective, and you can really feel the difference after each use.
* **Smart Timer:** No more guessing how long to brush—it tells you when to switch sections of your mouth.
* **Travel-Friendly:** It comes with a sleek travel case, so you don’t have to sacrifice your routine while on the go.

## Who Should Consider a Teeth Polisher?

If you’re wondering whether you actually *need* a teeth polisher, here are a few signs:

* You drink coffee, tea, or wine regularly and struggle with surface stains.
* You want to enhance the shine of your teeth without investing in pricey whitening treatments.
* You’re aiming for that smooth, dentist-clean feeling every day.

## What I Loved About the AquaSonic Black Series

* **Design:** Let’s not ignore the aesthetics. This toothbrush looks like it belongs in a high-end spa.
* **Value:** For the price, you’re not just getting a toothbrush—you’re getting a full oral care system. The 8 brush heads alone make it a smart investment.
* **Customizability:** The 4 brushing modes let you tailor your routine, whether you’re focused on cleaning, whitening, or polishing.

## A Few Things to Keep in Mind

* **Battery Life:** The wireless charging dock is super convenient, but the battery lasts so long you might forget it even needs charging.
* **It’s Powerful:** If you’re switching from a manual toothbrush, it might take a few days to get used to the intense vibrations. Trust me, it’s worth it.

## Final Thoughts on Teeth Polishing at Home 🖤

The AquaSonic Black Series has changed how I think about oral care. It’s not just about cleaning my teeth—it’s about maintaining their health and appearance in the easiest way possible. With its advanced polishing mode, it’s like having a mini dental hygienist at home.

If you’ve been considering a teeth polisher, this is an awesome option. You can check it out here: [**AquaSonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush**](https://geni.us/gXPTfZT).

However as I’ve grown older I’ve wanted more privacy, alone time and independence which I think is natural for most teens. My parents are just very clinging and because of that they often neglect my privacy and it’s really starting to piss me off. They have no bad intentions nor are they strict but they’ll just waltz into my room without knocking and just invite themselves in. I could have friends over or even be at work and my mom will just come into my room and touch my stuff or organize it. I don’t appreciate the breach in privacy because obv there are hints in my room my parents do not need to see. I can clean and organize my own room no problem but I don’t like when I’m out of the house my mom invites herself in and does it for me. I always tell her she has no reason to be in there and that whatever she’s doing I will do myslef but then she gets mad. It’s getting to the point where I can be in a PlayStation party with my friends saying god knows what kind of stupid shit boys say when there goofing off and all of a sudden my mom just walks into my room and starts puttering around and moving my clothes or grabbing my garbage. I know she’s being helpful but like I can do all that myself and I will do it later just not RIGHT IS VERY MOMENT WHEN IM WITH MY FRIENDS. Even when I’d have my ex over we could be doing god knows what and my mom or dad would just walk in the room to say dinners ready or something. Like can you not just text me or shout my name. The amount of times they just walked in on us having intimate moments was embarrassing and annoying. Sometimes when I get up in the morning I make my coffee and sit down to watch some tv and eat before school or work. I’m not much of a morning person so I just put my headphones in and get ready but my parents start bombarding me with information that isn’t relevant or important at that very moment at 7 in the morning so I tell them I don’t feel like talking right now. Like I feel it’s pretty normal to not want to socialize at 7 in the morning when I’ve just woken up yet my parents are already listing off all the days tasks and strategizing as iff were If we’re in a fucking football huddle. Like mom i just woke up can I just eat and get ready in silence. Then they get upset and tell me I’m just being rude and they won’t stop telling me or other people. At Christmas with eh family they kept joking saying I was a “grumpy teenager” and it pisses me off because I don’t think me wanting to put my headphones in and tune out reality for a bit before or after a long day makes me grumpy. Sorry I don’t want to talk after my eight hour shift guys! I just got home can you give me a minute to breath. I feel like this is pretty reasonable. I just want them to respect my privacy and understand that when I have things to do I don’t always want to socialize and I don’t think that makes me rude. I hope this makes sense and These issues are not too crazy but they just piss me off. My fellow teens out there I want to know, do y’all value privacy and quiet as much as I do, we are pretty busy and have a lot on our plate and I don’t always want to chat. Literally as I was writing this my mom just walked in without knocking to tell me breakfast was ready and proceeded to open my closet and take my laundry and start talking to me. Like I just woke up and I want a few minutes to myself and I don’t appreciate her inviting herself into my room whenever she pleased and I had planned on brining the laundry downstatirs on the the way to breakfast anyway but she does it herself and when I tell her it’s okay I got it she does in anyway and a few hours later she hits me with the what can’t you do your own ___ why do I have to do it for you. Like bro I was going to do it and you walked in did it yourself and I told you you didn’t have to and you still did. Obv she’s just helping around the house but I just want her to stop coming into my room whenever she pleases and doing my chores for me. I just want some independence and privacy.",1,1735494862.0,AdviceForTeens,1,1.0,False

1hp1hld,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1hp1hld/all_the_times_biden_denied_meeting_with_hunters/,All the times Biden denied meeting with Hunter’s biz associates — as more photos emerge and expose president,"[https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/all-the-times-biden-denied-meeting-with-hunters-biz-associates-as-more-photos-emerge-and-expose-president/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/all-the-times-biden-denied-meeting-with-hunters-biz-associates-as-more-photos-emerge-and-expose-president/)

  
President Biden has for years flatly denied interacting with his relatives’ foreign business associates — a contention further debunked this week as [newly released photos ](https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/feds-finally-release-photos-showing-then-vp-biden-meeting-son-hunters-china-biz-partners-days-before-he-leaves-office/)show him meeting two of first son Hunter Biden’s business associates in China while he was vice president.

Biden, 82, was the focus of a rare House impeachment inquiry into whether he inappropriately enriched his family in countries where he held sway as vice president — with that probe ending shortly after he abandoned his re-election bid this summer with an[ August report](https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/us-news/biden-accused-of-abuse-of-power-obstruction-in-impeachment-probe/) concluding he abused his power.

The question of Biden’s degree of involvement in foreign dealings now is largely academic, as he and his family are no longer expected to play a significant role in American foreign policy following his retirement on Jan. 20.

  
The matter could present future credibility issues for Biden allies, however, such as top Oversight Committee Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who[ insisted in February ](https://nypost.com/2024/02/28/us-news/top-house-oversight-dem-rep-jamie-raskin-not-aware-biden-met-with-hunter-biz-associates-despite-testimony/)that “there were no meetings with the president.”

  
A review of Biden’s public statements demonstrate a pattern of dishonesty as a mountain of evidence — including photos, emails and witness statements — showed that he did indeed interact with his family’s business partners.

  
The newly released photos show Biden as vice president shaking hands and posing with the incoming CEO of Chinese state-backed BHR Partner, Jonathan Li, and BHR’s managing director Ming Xue during a December 2013 official trip to Beijing. Hunter held a 10% stake in the firm, which sought out natural resources such as cobalt for China, through at least part of his father’s presidency.

The snapshots also show the elder Biden introducing his son to Chinese President Xi Jinping less than two weeks before BHR Partners was officially registered as a business.

# ‘I did not interact with their partners’

Biden [directly denied](https://nypost.com/2024/03/01/us-news/biden-insists-he-didnt-interact-with-hunter-james-biz-partners/) that he interacted with first son Hunter and first brother James Biden’s business partners on March 1, 2024 — just two days after [Hunter privately admitted ](https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/us-news/hunter-biden-transcript-released-following-impeachment-testimony/)in his impeachment inquiry deposition that his dad had engaged with his associates from China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine.

“\[House\] Speaker \[Mike\] Johnson has accused you of lying repeatedly about your interactions with your son and brother’s business partners. What’s your response to him?” a reporter for The Post asked Biden on the White House lawn.

  
“Tell him to read the record of every single witness,” Biden at first replied, even though many witnesses in fact had described his interactions with those associates. “These guys got to stop this stuff.”

“But you did interact with their partners,” the journalist prompted.

“I did not interact with their partners,” Biden insisted.

“You didn’t have dinner or lunch or coffee?” The Post followed up, referring to inquiry witness testimony.

“No,” Biden said.

  
BTW these people wanted to control who determined what truth is. Why do we continue to trust liars? Not just Joe Biden but all the organizations that push these lies. This is why the MSM is not trusted. This is why people voted for Donald Trump. 

  
We are sick of the lies. We are sick of the censorship. We are sick of the government wasting our money. We want secure borders, we want small government, we want our cost of living to go down.

  
These are what we fight for. Will continue to fight for

Hey, I’m 18M, and I’m in 12th grade now. In a few months, I’ll finally leave behind the nightmare that has been my school life. But before that, I want to share my story—the story of how a girl, fueled by her delusions and petty vendettas, almost destroyed me.
It started way back in the third grade. Our teacher, in her infinite wisdom, decided to pair students based on academic performance—“weak” ones with “strong” ones. I got paired with her. Let’s call her Kavya. From day one, she wasn’t fond of me. I don’t know what it was—maybe my quiet nature rubbed her the wrong way—but she made it clear she thought I didn’t belong.
Fast forward to middle school, and things only got worse. Kavya was one of those girls who had the perfect mix of popularity and pretty privilege. Everyone liked her. Me? I was the introverted, awkward kid, but I had a good friend group—a bunch of kids who adopted me despite my shy nature.
But then came the incident. One day, in a moment of pure coincidence, I made a lip-smacking sound, and she somehow interpreted it as a “flying kiss.” I swear it was nothing of the sort. But Kavya? She twisted it into a personal attack, dredging up some harassment case involving another guy and projecting all of it onto me. It was like she decided right then and there that I was the villain in her story.
And boy, did she act on that.
She started spreading rumors—nasty ones. That I was dirty, that I was poor, that I harassed her. She’d weaponize her popularity to make me the laughingstock of the school. Kids would call me “stinky,” mock me in the hallways, and treat me like dirt.
What hurt the most was when my own friend group began to pull away. None of them believed her lies—thank God for that. But the constant criticism and bullying from others forced them to distance themselves. It wasn’t their fault, I guess. No one wants to be on the receiving end of that kind of targeted hate.
Then, our school shut down, and we all moved to a new one. I thought maybe, just maybe, I’d get a fresh start. But nope. Kavya carried her crusade against me to the new school. She made sure everyone “knew” about me before I even had a chance to introduce myself. I became the outcast—socially isolated, bullied, and miserable.
By 9th grade, all my old friends had switched schools. I was left behind, stuck in a place where Kavya’s manipulations ran unchecked. Every day felt like a battle just to keep my head above water. I turned to caffeine to cope. I’d chug coffee just to get through the day, hoping the buzz would drown out the exhaustion of constantly defending my existence.
There was one friend I truly thought would stick by me. Let’s call him Raj. He was the one who brought me into our friend group back in the old school, the one who saw through Kavya’s lies from the start. But Raj left too—got a sports scholarship at another school and moved on. He found new friends and forgot about me. That betrayal hurt more than anything.
And Kavya? She didn’t stop. Even at our farewell, she found a way to humiliate me. Someone from a junior group chat I was part of called her out for something and so did the rest, and she automatically assumed it was me. While she herself , crammed into some tiny car and came for the event, and called me “broke” for not driving there myself. The truth? I couldn’t drive, so I took a cab. What’s the big deal ?
Oh, and the outfit-shaming? Classic Kavya. One of her minions sneered at my jacket, calling it something a pan shop owner would wear. But when he saw it was D&G, the look on his face was priceless.
But you know what? I’ve survived. Despite everything, I’m still here. A few more months, and I’ll be out of this hellhole, leaving Kavya and her toxic circus behind.
Looking back, I realize she never really “ruined” my life. Sure, she made it hell for a while, but I’m still standing. And I know, deep down, that her actions say more about her insecurities than anything about me.
To anyone going through something similar—stay strong. The people who matter will see through the lies, and the ones who believe them? They were never worth your time anyway.",1,1735494812.0,story,0,1.0,False

When the mind fractures, when psychopathy and crime emerge from the shadows, the answers are more complicated than one might imagine. And yet, I can't stop searching. Because when it comes to the human mind, there's something deeply seductive about unraveling what lies beyond the visible.""

Martina's voice is clear, but there's something in her tone that's hard to pinpoint. A subtle tremor in her words, as if she's speaking of something that has her trapped, though she can't resist it. There's an obsession—not just scientific but personal.

\- ""Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. My name is Martina. I'm a neuroscientist, though I don't call myself that too often. My colleagues refer to me as 'the odd one' because of my approach. No one understands why I sometimes spend entire days investigating human behavior and its darkest disorders. I'm the one always looking for patterns in broken minds, those that fall between the margins of normalcy. People sometimes look at me like I'm dangerous. And no, I'm not talking about those lunatics from horror movies. I'm talking about those cases psychiatrists dismiss as 'anomalies,' as 'complex minds.' That's the kind of person who truly intrigues me. Those who never fit in, those everyone avoids. The ones who, in the end, make a difference.""

Martina reflects silently as the faint sound of a coffee machine hums in the background. The noises are constant, but the feeling in the scene is one of isolation. Martina is alone in her thoughts, immersed in something much bigger than herself. This is where her story begins.

\- ""Over the years, I've worked with many experts, but I can't say all of them understood the 'why' of this research. Though, of course, I don't care much about what they think. Dr. Avery, for instance... he'll never understand. He's brilliant, sure, but sometimes his methods... his cold, almost calculated ways, send shivers down my spine. He's British, which probably explains his distance. He always has this distant look, as if he's seeing something through a fog no one else can. But what bothers me is his silence.""

\- ""Then there's Sofia. She's completely different. Her mindset... it's more open, warmer. She'll never admit it, but she's grown attached to the team, to the people. Even though she feels like a fish out of water, she always has something to say, something that adds to the analysis, something that questions what we think we know about humans and their relationship with nature. People like Sofia, who observe ecosystems, the connections between animals and human behavior, puzzle me. But not in a bad way. She gives me hope, somehow. Even if she'll never tell me, I know she's just as caught up in this mystery as I am. She, like me, is searching for answers.""

\- ""But, of course, not everyone on the team shares my enthusiasm. Some are only here because they're interested in the money or the prestige that comes with the project.""

\- ""I can't tell you everything now. It's not the time. But when this research comes to an end, when it all falls apart... you'll understand what we discovered. And what we did—what I did—to stop it.""

The lab is silent, the faint hum of computers blending with the whisper of leaves brushing against the windows from the gentle wind outside. It's early morning, but the tension is already palpable in the air. I'm sitting at a table cluttered with papers. There are studies on bee behavior, charts detailing their communication through pheromones, and meticulous observations of movement within hives. The images of the bees are vividly imprinted in my mind, their flight in perfect harmony, like a clock in motion. But today, I can't focus on that.

I sense Sofia's presence behind me before hearing her voice.

\- ""How are we doing with the data from Hive 3?"" Sofia asks, her tone usually optimistic, but there's something in her voice that makes me think she's uneasy too.

\- ""I don't know,"" I reply, running a hand through my hair. ""It seems like the bees' behavior in Hive 3 is off. They're more agitated than usual. It's like something is disturbing them.""

Sofia moves closer, studying the data on my screen. Her eyes skim over the charts and notes I've been taking, and then she looks at me with a mix of uncertainty and concern.

\- ""Do you think something might be interfering with their pheromones?"" she suggests. ""Maybe there's an external factor we're overlooking.""

\- ""That's what I'm thinking. Their flight patterns are erratic, and not just in one hive, but several. It could be something in the environment, or maybe... something else,"" I hesitate, trying to sound confident but faltering.

Sofia raises an eyebrow, as if unsure what I'm hinting at. Before she can say anything, Dr. Avery steps into the room. Always so formal, so meticulous. Every step he takes feels calculated, as though he's measuring his presence.

\- ""What do we have here, ladies?"" His tone is sharp but not entirely impolite. Then again, he always has that distant air, like he's on a mission he doesn't fully comprehend. ""Any progress with the bees?""

Sofia glances at him and answers quickly, as she always does, trying to avoid any potential conflict.

\- ""We're noticing some unusual patterns. Over the past few weeks, the bees in several hives have shown signs of disturbance. We're not sure what's causing it.""

Dr. Avery steps closer, takes a brief look at the data on my computer screen, and after a moment of silence, nods with mild disdain.

\- ""And what do you propose to do about it?"" His tone suggests he's less concerned about the bees than we are. He's focused on progress, on results, not on details that can't be controlled.

\- ""We wanted to conduct a series of further tests. Maybe expose them to different controlled environments to see how they react, but..."" Sofia trails off, glancing at other team members who have started entering the room. ""What if it's something more? Something out of the ordinary.""

Sofia's words hang in the air, heavier than expected. Dr. Avery looks at her with an impassive expression, as though he doesn't understand what she's implying.

\- ""What I care about, ladies,"" Dr. Avery begins, cutting off any response, ""is that we get concrete results. This isn't an investigation into theories. If something is interfering with the bees, we need to know what it is—period. We don't have time for... conjectures.""

The tension is tangible. It's rare to see Dr. Avery this engaged in a conversation that isn't directly about results.

\- ""I know,"" I say, noticing how my thoughts whirl. But something feels wrong—something I can't put into words. ""I think we're facing something more... more than just an environmental issue.""

Sofia shoots me a quick glance. She feels it too. Sometimes, we don't need words to understand what the other is thinking. At that moment, the team gathers around the table, and Dr. Avery shifts the topic, launching into a formal meeting about progress and next steps.

I forget about the subject. Here, they only care about... results. ",1,1735494390.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I'm living here for a while, using a Hario switch and pre ground coffee. It has mostly been good, I'm enjoying the coffee that I'm making.

Followed the Hoffman guide for the switch, modified to have an output of 500ml. (fill up brew area with water, add 30gish coffee, do the normal Hoffman stuff then add hot water until it = 500ml. Much easier than the math methods!) But I can tell it could be better, so I'm looking for a manual coffee grinder.

ALL of the coffee I've seen here is medium to dark roast. I was hoping to finally try a light roast now that I've been learning more about coffee, but no joy at the grocery stores.

Suggestions on particular roasters in and around Manila would be awesome!

1hp1858,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentalmaterials/comments/1hp1858/the_charcoal_teeth_whitening_powder_youve_been/,The Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder You've Been Looking For,"Hey Reddit! 👋 Let’s talk teeth. Specifically, whitening them. If you’ve ever scrolled through Instagram or TikTok, chances are you’ve seen someone raving about **charcoal teeth whitening powder**.

At first glance, it might seem like another fad, but I’m here to share my honest experience and some facts about why this natural option is gaining traction.

## What’s the Deal with Charcoal Teeth Whitening? 🦷✨

Activated charcoal has been used for centuries in everything from skincare to detox drinks, but its role in teeth whitening is pretty cool. It’s a natural substance made from heating carbon-rich materials (like coconut shells) to extreme temperatures. This process makes it super porous, giving it a unique ability to “trap” stains and toxins.

When used on teeth, activated charcoal can help lift surface stains from coffee, tea, wine, and other culprits. What’s even better? It does all this without harsh chemicals, which is why it’s a go-to for people looking for a natural alternative to traditional whitening products.

## Why I Tried Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder 🖤

Like many of you, I’ve tried my share of whitening strips and gels. While some worked, they often left my teeth feeling sensitive and my gums irritated. Plus, I couldn’t ignore the artificial ingredients. So, I went down the natural route and stumbled upon the [**Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder**](https://geni.us/NUDW4G) made from natural coconut charcoal.

What caught my eye:

* **Natural Ingredients:** It’s made from coconut charcoal, which feels a lot better than brushing with a cocktail of unpronounceable chemicals.
* **Safe for Gums and Enamel:** I’m protective of my enamel (because, let’s be real, once it’s gone, it’s gone), so the promise of a non-abrasive formula sealed the deal.
* **Multi-Purpose:** It works as both a teeth stain remover and a toothpaste alternative, which is a win for anyone trying to simplify their oral care routine.

## First Impressions of Charcoal Whitening Powder

Let me set the scene: I opened the little jar of charcoal powder and was immediately struck by how fine the powder is. No clumps, no weird smells—just ultra-fine black powder ready to work its magic.

Using it is simple:

1. Wet your toothbrush.
2. Dip it into the powder (a little goes a long way).
3. Brush gently for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse thoroughly.

Pro tip: Do this over the sink because, yes, it can get a bit messy. But it’s nothing a quick rinse won’t fix.

## Does It Actually Work?

Here’s where things get interesting. After my first use, I didn’t see dramatic results (which is normal—no product will give you a movie-star smile overnight). But what I did notice was how clean my teeth felt. It’s like the charcoal gives you that “just left the dentist” kind of clean.

By week two, I started noticing a difference. My teeth looked brighter, and those annoying coffee stains on my front teeth were fading. The powder doesn’t *bleach* your teeth like chemical whiteners, but it lifts surface stains naturally, which is perfect if you’re aiming for a gradual, natural-looking improvement.

## Things I Loved About This Product

* **Gentle on Teeth:** Unlike some charcoal products that feel gritty, this one is ultra-fine and gentle.
* **No Weird Aftertaste:** You’d think brushing with charcoal might taste like licking a BBQ grill, but nope! It’s surprisingly neutral.
* **Cost-Effective:** A single jar lasts forever. Okay, maybe not forever, but long enough to feel like you’re getting your money’s worth.

## Things to Keep in Mind

While I’m a big fan, there are a couple of things worth noting:

* **It’s Not Magic:** If your teeth are naturally darker or have deep stains, this might not be a miracle solution. It works best on surface stains.
* **It’s Black Powder:** If you’re clumsy like me, you might end up with black splatters on your sink. Just clean it up right away, and you’re good.

## Why You Should Give It a Go

If you’re curious about natural oral care or tired of harsh whitening products, this [**Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder**](https://geni.us/NUDW4G) is worth a try. It’s safe, effective, and fits seamlessly into your routine. Plus, it’s fun. Seriously, there’s something satisfying about brushing with black powder and revealing a brighter smile afterward.

## FAQs About Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder

**#1. Will it make my teeth completely white?**  
It’s great for removing surface stains and brightening your smile, but it won’t change the natural shade of your teeth like professional whitening.

**#2. Can I use it every day?**  
Most people use it 2-3 times a week to avoid overdoing it. Even though it’s gentle, moderation is key.

**#3. Is it safe for kids?**  
While it’s non-toxic, always check with a dentist before introducing new products to children.

## Final Thoughts 🖤

I’m officially a fan of charcoal teeth whitening powder. It’s an easy, affordable way to freshen up your smile without exposing your teeth to harsh chemicals. If you’re on the fence, give it a shot and let me know what you think. You can grab the one I’ve been using here: [**Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder**](https://geni.us/NUDW4G).

1hp180h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hp180h/f_color_diamonds_expert_tips_and_complete_value/,F Color Diamonds: Expert Tips and Complete Value Analysis,"# Key Notes and Bottom Line:

F color diamonds offer exceptional value within the colorless range. Key points to remember:

* F-color diamonds provide an outstandingly colorless look, virtually indistinguishable from higher grades to the naked eye.
* F-color diamonds fall within the colorless category, representing less than 2% of all natural diamonds.
* Price difference: A 1.00 carat F VS1 diamond costs $5,400 while a similar D color diamond costs $6,040, a 11.85% price difference

* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A 2.00 carat F color with VVS1 clarity natural diamond is sold for $28,510, while a similar lab-grown diamond is sold for $3,130, an 89% difference!

* Strong investment potential
* The average price of a 1.00 carat E color diamond is $6,100
* Alternatively, you can save significantly more if you choose a near colorless grade. For example, the average price of a 1.00 carat H color diamond is $4,125, approximately 32% price difference.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Buyers seeking high-quality diamonds without overpaying
* Those wanting a colorless diamond for engagement rings or special occasions
* Shoppers balancing quality and budget

# Who is this not for?

* Collectors demanding only the highest color grades (D-E)
* Individuals extremely sensitive to subtle color differences
* Those prioritizing potential resale value over initial cost savings

# Recommendations for smart buying:

1. Prioritize cut quality to maximize brilliance and fire
2. Compare F color diamonds side-by-side with G color to see if you can spot differences
3. Consider lab-grown F color diamonds for significant savings
4. Choose white gold or platinum settings to enhance the colorless appearance
5. Focus on round cuts to minimize any subtle color visibility

# FAQ

Q: How noticeable is the difference between F and D/E colors?

A: The difference is minimal and typically only detectable by trained gemologists under specific conditions.

Q: Are F color diamonds a good investment?

A: While they hold value well, they may not appreciate as much as higher color grades. Buy for personal enjoyment rather than investment.

Q: Do F color diamonds look yellow?

A: No, F color diamonds appear colorless to the naked eye and do not exhibit a yellow tint.

Q: How does diamond shape affect F color appearance?

A: Round cuts are ideal for F colors. Shapes with larger tables (emerald, Asscher) may make subtle color more noticeable.

Q: Is an F color diamond worth the extra cost over a G color?

A: For many buyers, the slight improvement in color isn't worth the price jump. Compare side-by-side to decide if it matters to you.

By choosing an F color diamond, you're getting a stone that looks virtually identical to the highest color grades at a more accessible price point. Focus on finding a well-cut F color diamond for the best balance of quality and value.

My brain keeps giving me weird ideas that I know sound weird which mean I shouldnt believe or think them... yet i somewhat do and they seem to make sense? and it keeps popping up as some reason something else happens.

I know theyre weird cause i know what everyone else would say if i expressed it, and im aware that people with psychosis arent really aware of it... coffee seems to help and whenever i go coffee free it seems to pop up more?

I've had stuff like that in the past and it went away and i suppose popped back up? I've been telling myself its weird so i should cut it out, its not physically possible, and that there wouldbe various consequences if it were happening. Like it still kinda makes sense though?

Ideas that have been sticking around that are kinda weird -

Every now and then im pretty sure im going through male puberty

I keep thinking/having realizations where hey I actually did affect my ads with my thoughts, changed someones mind by thinking about it, thoughts that something non-physical is collecting my thoughts.

Occasionally some weird feeling in my throat that leads to thoughts that something spiritual wants to speak through me

and that I'm in some sort of testing program, which i sometimes think my familly/father is somewhat in on, but its mainly me being randomly chosen to be part of some labaratory like testing from spiritual things that i was in due to health issues as an infant.

And... some other things... kinda. Its popped up once or twice but... idrc anymore but part of me thought? thinks but ignored? that my college campus was keeping tabs on me and that my father is secretely microdosing me or that he put something into the coffee. (I quit not cause of that but cause of other non weird reasons). I think quitting coffee helped me be less anxious about things? I quit a few days ago. Prior to that though I used to think I could feel spiritual things in my room or watching through like clocks and round flat surfaces. Then i had alot of coffee twice a week or so and it went away?

Weird thoughts like that that im aware i shouldnt think due to how they sound. Coffee seemingly helped a bit but if i had too much it just wasnt good for my mental health.

However im aware theyre weird so I should just ignore it, but the issue is that i somewhat think they make sense when i know it shouldnt? Im mainly going off of the fact that theyre weird thoughts.

Made myself quit spirituality which seemingly helped. Yeah I should try and bring it up to someone, but im guessing its not that bad if im aware its weird right? Cause I saw people online say that if you think youre loosing your mind, you arent, so that means it likely isnt anything severe developing since im aware its weird",2,1735493873.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

I get asked out on these all the time but it never feels romantic - just feels like two people chatting and sharing stuff about their lives. Often the coffee gets taken back to drink in the car as well. The lack of effort put into the whole thing also kills the vibe a bit, because it’s so informal. The lack of opportunity for affectionate physical escalation also doesn’t help.

On the other hand, going on more formal dates (activities, watching a movie, eating dinner) has also felt like too much for a first time meeting between two strangers. Things can also feel prematurely sexual during these types of dates too, if things are going well but it’s often just lust.

------------------------------------------------------

Choosing a barndominium kit in Arkansas can be an exciting journey. These modern homes blend the functionality of a barn with the comforts of a traditional house. If you are considering building your dream home, here are some compelling reasons why barndominium kits are a fantastic option for you.

### Cost-Effective Construction

One of the primary benefits of barndominium kits is their affordability. These kits come pre-designed, which helps you save on both material and labor costs. You can avoid the extensive costs often associated with custom builds. Plus, many kits allow for flexibility in design, ensuring you can stay within your budget while still getting the home you want.

### Quick and Efficient Build

The simplicity of barndominium kits facilitates a quicker construction process. Many kits arrive ready to assemble, which means less time waiting for materials and a speedier build schedule. If you are eager to move into your new home, this time-efficiency can be a significant advantage.

### Durable and Low Maintenance

Barndominiums are built with strong materials, typically metal or steel. This durability translates into lower maintenance costs over time. Unlike traditional homes that may need frequent repairs, a barndominium can withstand harsh weather conditions and requires minimal upkeep. This durability gives you peace of mind, knowing that your investment will last for years.

### Design Flexibility

Another appealing aspect of barndominium kits is the versatility in design. With various floor plans and styles to choose from, you can personalize your home to fit your needs. Whether you prefer an open layout or segmented rooms, the options are endless. This flexibility allows you to create a space that reflects your lifestyle and tastes.

### Energy Efficiency

Modern barndominium kits can be designed with energy efficiency in mind. Many kits include insulation designed to keep your home warm in winter and cool in summer. This can lead to lower energy bills, contributing to your long-term savings. Additionally, you may consider incorporating solar panels or energy-efficient appliances for further savings and sustainability.

### Rural Charm and Open Spaces

Living in a barndominium allows you to enjoy the charm of rural Arkansas. With plenty of open space around you, you can create your own oasis. Imagine sitting on your porch, enjoying a cup of coffee while soaking in the beautiful scenery. Barndominiums often include extra space for workshops or storage, making them ideal for those who work from home or have hobbies that require additional room.

### Community and Lifestyle

Arkansas boasts a friendly community atmosphere, especially in rural areas. By choosing to build a barndominium, you become a part of this community. Engaging with neighbors and local events can enhance your lifestyle and provide a support network. Barndominiums serve as more than just houses; they often become homes filled with memories and connections.

### Investment Potential

Barndominiums can also be a smart investment. As more people discover the charm and benefits of these unique homes, their popularity increases. This trend could lead to a rise in property values over time, making your barndominium not only a comfortable space to live but also a valuable asset. Investing in a barndominium reflects a forward-thinking choice tailored to modern living.

- **Cost-Effective:** Save on materials and labor costs.
- **Quick Build Time:** Faster assembly compared to traditional homes.
- **Durability:** Built to withstand weather conditions.
- **Design Versatility:** Customizable floor plans and layouts.
- **Energy Efficient:** Potential for lower energy bills.
- **Rural Appeal:** Enjoy the scenery and open spaces.
- **Community Feel:** Connect with friendly neighbors.
- **Investment Potential:** Increased property value over time.

Choosing barndominium kits in Arkansas offers numerous benefits ranging from cost savings to design flexibility. With their growing popularity, a barndominium can provide a unique blend of modern living and rural charm tailored to your lifestyle. Your dream home could be just a kit away, ready to transform into a beautiful living space. The choices you make today can lead to a fulfilling life in your new home tomorrow.

Comparing Costs: Barndominium Kits vs. Traditional Home Construction in Arkansas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Arkansas, the choice between barndominium kits and traditional home construction can greatly impact your budget and lifestyle. If you're considering building a home, understanding the cost differences can help you make an informed decision.

Barndominiums, a unique blend of barn and condominium, have gained popularity due to their affordability and versatility. These kits often come with everything you need to build your new home, from the frame to the roofing materials. When you compare these kits with traditional home construction methods, several factors come into play, including price, design flexibility, and construction time.

### Cost Breakdown of Barndominium Kits

Barndominium kits are typically less expensive than traditional homes. Here's a breakdown of the costs you might expect:

- **Base Kit Price:** The cost of a barndominium kit usually starts at around $30 to $60 per square foot. So, if you're looking at a 1,500 square foot barndominium, you might pay between $45,000 to $90,000 for the kit alone.
- **Construction Costs:** Once you have the kit, construction costs for labor and additional materials may add another $20,000 to $50,000, depending on your location and the complexity of your design.
- **Utilities and Finishing:** Don't forget about the costs of plumbing, electrical work, and interior finishes, which can range from $10,000 to $30,000.

Adding these costs together, a complete barndominium project can run between $75,000 to $170,000. This is generally less than the average cost of traditional home construction in Arkansas.

### Cost Breakdown of Traditional Home Construction

When evaluating traditional home construction, the costs can vary significantly based on many factors, including location, design, and the materials you choose. Here's an overview:

- **Base Construction Costs:** Traditional home construction can start anywhere from $100 to $200 per square foot. For a similar 1,500 square foot home, this means you could be looking at costs of $150,000 to $300,000 just for the structure.
- **Site Preparation:** Most traditional homes require more extensive site preparation, which can add another $5,000 to $15,000 to your total costs.
- **Utilities and Finishing:** Similar to barndominiums, traditional homes also require plumbing, electrical work, and the finishing touches that can cost $20,000 or more.

A traditional home can cost anywhere from $175,000 to $350,000 for a similar size and quality. This makes traditional construction significantly pricier than choosing a barndominium kit.

### Design Flexibility and Construction Time

When comparing the two options, it's also essential to consider design flexibility and the time it takes to complete the construction.

Barndominium kits offer modular designs that can be customized to fit your needs. This can be a great advantage for those who want a specific look or need particular features, like large open spaces or high ceilings.

On the other hand, traditional homes often require more time for planning and architectural design. You'll need to work with architects and contractors to get the exact look you want. This can significantly lengthen the timeline, with traditional builds taking sometimes up to a year or more to complete, compared to a barndominium that might be ready in just a few months.

### : Making the Right Choice

Choosing between barndominium kits and traditional home construction in Arkansas boils down to personal preferences and budget considerations. Barndominiums provide a more affordable option with quicker construction times, while traditional homes offer more design possibilities but at a higher cost and extended timeline. As you think about your ideal home, weigh these factors to help you find the best fit for your lifestyle and financial situation.

### Conclusion

Choosing a barndominium kit in Arkansas presents numerous advantages, making it an appealing option for many homeowners. The unique blend of aesthetics and functionality captures attention while offering modern living within a rustic shell. The appeal of wide-open spaces and customizable designs allows you to truly make the space your own, which can be a significant draw for families and individuals seeking a more personalized home.

When comparing costs, barndominium kits often emerge as a more economical choice than traditional home construction. While building a conventional home can lead to unexpected expenses, opting for a barndominium kit typically features transparent pricing and less chance for budget overruns. The streamlined construction process often requires less time and labor, further enhancing the cost-effectiveness of this choice.

Thus, as you consider your housing options, think about how a barndominium not only meets your needs but also aligns with your budget. Whether you are looking to build a primary residence, a vacation home, or a unique space to live and work, barndominium kits in Arkansas provide an innovative solution that combines style, affordability, and practicality. It's time to embrace the possibilities of barndominiums and turn your dream home into a reality. With careful planning and the right kit, your new home can be everything you envision, providing a cozy retreat nestled in the Arkansas landscape.",1,1735493464.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Shipping is not included in the price. CONUS shipping will be between 5USD and 10USD depending on how far you are from me – anything over that I’ll cover it. Happy to offer discounts and freebies if you buy multiple items!

 

**PENS**

1. ~~Sailor Pro Gear 21k <F> nib in ivory and black, silver trim. Great writer, no notable flaws, sailor Fs are just too fine for me. Condition B or D (this F sailor nib was swapped in).~~ **~~Asking 135USD~~**~~.~~  SOLD
2. Wingsung 629 sapphire blue gold trim flat top with 14k <EF> nib. Writes like a fine architect grind. The famous Montblanc 146 dupe but honestly the flat top version doesn’t resemble anything on the market that I know of. It’s an awesome piston filler pen – great capacity, works smoothly. I’d only recommend this one if you enjoy feedback with your nibs – it’s comparable to Platinum’s current 14k nibs in my opinion. Will come with its box. No notable flaws. Condition B. **Asking 65USD.** Great deal for a piston filler pen with a large 14k nib like this.
3. Aurora 98 vintage in all gold stripes. 14K <F?> nib. The 98 is the cartridge-filling successor of the venerable Aurora 88. This one is an exceptional writer. It has that wonderful aurora feedback that is audible but so gentle on your hand. Some tiny spots of plating loss that I don’t think detracts much from its beauty. A little loathe to sell this one, but the reality is that it’s just a hair too slim for me. Will come with its original king-size cartridge that I syringe fill. Condition C for vintage. **Asking 115USD**.
4. Tramol ‘Awakening the Lion’ with <EF> Jowo #6 nib unit. Tramol is a Chinese ink maker that makes a couple of nice fountain pens every now and then. This is a larger and heavier pen, with a lacquered brass body. Inked only once – I just don’t reach for it, it’s a bit heavy for my preference. Will come with original box. Condition B conservatively. **Asking 25USD.**
5. !!PARTS ONLY!! Pineider La Grande Bellezza Gemstones Series in Lapis Lazuli. NO NIB. Any Bock nib unit will fit in here. Brassing on the end of the grip section, some lifting of the plastic rim at the end, but I can probably fix that for you. Works well otherwise – convenient magnetic twist capping, and the lapis body is just a lovely blue. D condition – **asking 35USD OBO**.

 

**CASES**

All these pen cases are great, my addiction has devolved to the point where I just have one of those massive pen storage drawers now so…

6. Esterbrook 20-pen canvas case in tan. Condition C- for all the snags and catches on the elastic loops inside. Slight fading on the canvas exterior but I think it looks better this way hah. Perfectly functional and does a great job of protecting pens. HOWEVER – I have read reports that the inner fabric is very dye-saturated and some people have found that it stains their light-colored pens made from more porous materials. I’ve had some of my light-colored pens in mine (sailors and pilots mainly) for over a year and I haven’t seen any issues with staining but I think PMMA has less of an issue. Just be safe rather than sorry when choosing what to store in these esterbrook cases, I’d hate for your pens to get damaged. **Asking 25USD**.

7. Levenger Bomber Jacket 6-pen capsule. Deep coffee brown leather. Plaid fabric interior. Awesome little pen case, even has a cartridge compartment below. Structured and very protective of your pens. Caveat is that it won’t comfortably fit any pen longer than 5.5in though (e.g. Pilot 823). Condition B. **Asking 40USD**.

8. Harris Tweed zip-around 8-pen case. Lovely harris tweed exterior, YKK bronze zipper, microsuede interior with flaps. Protective and compact. Condition B- for some very minor staining inside from pen clips. **Asking 40USD.**

9. Embroidered pine forest 5-pen fabric pouch. Fabric is a linen-cotton blend, lined with microsuede. Very soft and season appropriate. Condition B. **Asking 15USD.**

 

**NOTEBOOK COVERS AND BINDERS**

10. Chic Sparrow March Hare leather B6 cover with elastic strap. Well-loved cover, hand burnished the edges myself. I’d keep it but I don’t really like the B6 size for notebooks. This one will comfortably fit very thick notebooks like the Sterling Ink 520pg TRP. D for a couple of minor but noticeable ink stains. Will come with dust bag. **Asking 20USD.**

11. Chic Sparrow B5 cover in brown leather – I forgot the name of the leather. It’s thick, textured, on the floppy side and has a dry hand-feel. Tough piece. Condition B, will come with dust bag. **Asking 85USD.**

12. Herz Leather for Nanami Paper B6 slim Tan cover. Made to perfectly fit the Nanami café B6 notebook. C for some tiny splats of ink stain. **Asking 40USD.**

13. Herz Leather for Nanami Paper A5 Black cover. Made to perfectly fit the Nanami A5 seven seas notebooks. B- for a depressed mark on the front from storage. **Asking 50USD**

14. A6 Adjustable dusty pink fabric cover. Fabric is a textured linen-cotton blend material. Very soft and elegant. Adjustable for notebooks of different thickness with the elastic band at the back flap. Never used. **Asking USD10.**

15. A5 15mm 6 rings binder. Pebbled black leather exterior, orange-tan leather interior. Lots of compartments and pockets in the front and back. If you wanted a plotter-like binder in A5 size without paying the eye-watering price this is for you. Professional-looking and will take a beating hah. Made by a small Chinese leather crafts workshop.  **Asking 65USD.**

16. Levenger Adventure travel folio. Canvas and leather zip around folio that will fit a smaller tablet and slimmer a5 sized notebooks. Pen loop, card compartments. Gently used, but condition C because my cat bit the leather part and there are a couple of tiny tooth marks ;\_; . **Asking 30USD.**

-------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, and its benefits are backed by science. Every cell in your body needs water to function properly, and staying hydrated can significantly impact various bodily processes. Let’s explore the science behind the benefits of drinking water, highlighting some key reasons why you should ensure you’re drinking enough every day.

### Why Is Water Important?

Water makes up about 60% of your body weight. It is involved in numerous functions, including:

- Regulating body temperature
- Transporting nutrients and oxygen
- Removing waste products
- Lubricating joints
- Protecting organs and tissues

### Hydration and Physical Performance

Staying well-hydrated is crucial for maintaining your physical performance. Scientific studies show that even mild dehydration can impair your physical abilities. When you lose as little as 2% of your body’s water weight, you may experience fatigue, reduced endurance, and increased perceived effort during exercise.

Water helps to regulate your body temperature during exercise. When you sweat, your body loses water, which can lead to increased heart rate and body temperature. Drinking water before, during, and after exercise helps to prevent dehydration, ensuring optimal performance.

### Water and Mental Function

Staying hydrated is not just important for your physical health but also for your mental wellness. Research suggests a clear link between hydration and brain function. Dehydration can lead to difficulties in concentration, memory issues, and fatigue.

A study conducted on young women found that losing just 1.5% of body weight through water loss led to tension, anxiety, and decreased mood. This highlights the importance of maintaining hydration not only for bodily functions but also for mental clarity and emotional stability.

### Weight Management

If you're looking to manage your weight, drinking water can be a helpful ally. Research indicates that drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, which may lead to consuming fewer calories overall. When you replace sugary drinks with water, the reduction in calorie intake can also contribute to weight loss.

How Hydration Affects Physical Performance
------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is key for anyone, especially if you are physically active. Your body’s need for water increases as you exercise, and understanding how hydration affects your performance can lead to more effective workouts and a healthier lifestyle.

 Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Water is crucial for maintaining body temperature during physical activity. When you exercise, your body generates heat. To cool itself down, it sweats, which is primarily water. If you don’t replenish lost fluids, your body can overheat. This overheating can lead to poorer performance and even serious health issues if not addressed.

Dehydration can have immediate effects on how well you perform in sports and workouts. Some of these effects include:

 Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Fatigue:** Even mild dehydration can lead to increased fatigue. You may feel tired sooner than you would if you were well-hydrated.
- **Decrease in strength:** Your muscles need water to function effectively. Dehydration can decrease your strength and power.
- **Reduced endurance:** Long-term hydration issues can negatively impact your stamina, making it harder to sustain effort.
- **Impaired focus:** Hydration affects your cognitive function as well. Dehydrated athletes may find it harder to concentrate and make quick decisions.

Research shows that losing as little as 2% of your body’s water can start to impact your performance. For someone weighing 150 pounds, that’s only 3 pounds (about 1.4 kilograms). A good habit is to drink water regularly throughout the day, not just during workouts. Staying on top of your hydration helps ensure your body can perform at its best every time you exercise.

The timing and quantity of water intake matter too. Here are some guidelines to follow:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Before Exercise:** Drink about 17 to 20 ounces of water at least 2 hours before exercising. This helps set you up for a successful workout.
- **During Exercise:** Aim for 7 to 10 ounces of water every 10 to 20 minutes, especially if exercising for over an hour.
- **After Exercise:** Refill lost fluids. A good rule of thumb is to drink about 16 to 24 ounces of water for every pound lost during exercise.

Your hydration needs can vary depending on factors such as the climate, your body size, and the intensity of your workouts. For example, if you're exercising in hot and humid conditions, you might need to drink more water. Always listen to your body. Signs like dry mouth, dizziness, and dark-colored urine can indicate that you’re not drinking enough.

Beyond plain water, you can also hydrate through foods and beverages. Many fruits and vegetables, like watermelon, oranges, and cucumbers, contain a lot of water. Additionally, electrolyte drinks can be beneficial during intense workouts, as they help replace lost salts and minerals. However, be cautious with sugary sports drinks unless you're training for long periods, as they can lead to excess calorie intake.

Another important aspect is the effect of hydration on recovery. Drinking enough water after exercise can help your body recover faster. It aids in transporting nutrients to cells, removing waste, and reducing muscle soreness. Proper recovery is just as critical to performance as the workout itself, and hydration plays a significant role in this process.

Understanding how hydration affects your physical performance can help you reach your fitness goals more effectively. Whether you are an athlete or just someone who enjoys working out, being mindful of your hydration can make a big difference. Remember to drink consistently throughout the day, consider your body's needs, and hydrate wisely.

Common Myths About Water Consumption
------------------------------------

When it comes to water consumption, many people have misconceptions that can lead to unhealthy habits. Understanding the facts about drinking water is essential for your well-being. Here, we’ll debunk some common myths about water consumption to help you make informed decisions.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water Every Day

A popular belief is that everyone should drink a specific amount of water each day, often cited as eight 8-ounce glasses. While hydration is crucial, individual needs vary based on factors such as age, weight, activity level, and overall health. The National Academies of Sciences suggests that men can aim for about 3.7 liters (or about 15 cups) of total water daily, while women should target about 2.7 liters (or about 11 cups). This total can come from foods and other beverages, not just plain water.

### Myth 2: Water and Other Beverages Count Towards Your Daily Intake

Many people think that all liquids, including coffee, tea, and soda, are equally hydrating. While it’s true they contribute to your daily fluid intake, not all beverages are created equal. For example:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Caffeinated drinks:** While they can contribute to hydration, they may also act as mild diuretics, potentially causing you to lose fluids.
- **Sugary beverages:** These may taste good, but they can also lead to weight gain and other health issues.
- **Alcohol:** Consuming alcoholic drinks can lead to dehydration, so it’s essential to drink water alongside alcoholic beverages.

Plain water remains the best way to stay hydrated without additional sugars or calories.

### Myth 3: Thirst is a Sign of Dehydration

Many people believe that feeling thirsty indicates that they are already dehydrated. While thirst can be a sign that your body needs fluids, it doesn’t always mean you’re dehydrated. Regularly drinking water throughout the day can prevent you from reaching the point of thirst. It’s best to stay ahead of hydration instead of waiting until you feel thirsty.

### Myth 4: Drinking Water Helps You Lose Weight

Another common belief is that drinking water directly leads to weight loss. While drinking water can help control appetite and may replace higher-calorie beverages, it is not a magic solution. Studies have shown that drinking water before meals may help you eat less, but incorporating balanced meals and regular exercise is vital for effective weight management.

### Myth 5: You Can Overhydrate

While it’s essential to stay hydrated, many worry about drinking too much water. Overhydration, or water intoxication, is a rare condition that occurs when you consume an extreme amount of water in a short period, diluting essential electrolytes. However, for most people, it’s difficult to drink enough water to reach this level of danger. Listening to your body’s thirst cues often suffices.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: Drinking Water Can Prevent Hangovers

Many people believe that drinking water before bed can prevent hangovers. While staying hydrated may alleviate some symptoms, it doesn’t completely eliminate a hangover's effects. The best way to reduce the likelihood of a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation, stay hydrated, and eat a good meal before drinking.

### Myth 7: Bottled Water is Always Healthier than Tap Water

Some assume bottled water is superior to tap water. However, this isn’t always true. Bottled water is often just filtered tap water and can contain microplastics and chemicals from the plastic. In many cases, tap water is thoroughly regulated and safe to drink, sometimes even better than bottled. It’s wise to check the quality of your local water supply before investing in bottled water.

I bet some of you are dreaming of setting AI loose on your ALEKS math problems while you do damn near NOTHING and get perfect scores.

AI does the work, you get the points—basically, the ultimate academic win-win! But here’s the reality check: AI might be smart, but ALEKS is built like a boss-level video game that only a human can beat. 

Here’s the deal: ALEKS isn’t just about solving equations. It’s packed with interactive tools—graphs, charts, drag-and-drop activities, etc. You’ve got to physically manipulate stuff, draw lines, adjust sliders, and maybe even interpret visuals. It’s basically asking for a human touch. And last time I checked, your favorite AI do not have hands. 

Even if AI could spit out the right answers, it can’t drag that dot across a graph or adjust the parabola for you. And let’s not forget, ALEKS is adaptive. The moment AI makes a mistake, ALEKS is like, “Oh, you think this is hard? Let me crank up the difficulty and watch you squirm.”

So what’s the solution? You could spend hours trying to trick AI into doing half the work (spoiler: it’ll still flop on the interactive parts), or you could just hire an actual human. A human who gets ALEKS, knows how to finesse graphs, and can actually *use* those interactive tools like a pro. They’ll solve your problems while you sit back and sip your iced coffee.

Bottom line: AI might know math, but it doesn’t know *how* ALEKS works. Humans do. If you want guaranteed results and less stress, Team Human is the way to go.

Not to mention what to do quizzes, where you do NOT get multiple tries. Do you REALLY want to leave that AI?

What do y’all think? Is AI ready to handle ALEKS, or are we still stuck relying on actual brains and hands? Drop your thoughts below!

Dear Agent,

\[Personalization\]

THE SHOW UPS is an 80,000-word, multi-POV, upmarket novel with speculative elements in which mysterious forces send an ordinary woman to save three strangers from their despair. THE SHOW UPS will appeal to fans of the existential questions and answers in *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig, the connections between strangers that save a life found in *The Wedding People* by Alison Espach, and the hilarious and peculiar cast of *Anxious People* by Fredrick Backman.

Darla Thompson is a downtrodden journalist who wants more from life than to write obituaries and small-town human interest stories. On a day when life can’t get any worse, she receives an alarming, untraceable text telling her to “Save him,” with an address and an oddly specific time. It must be a hoax. Or maybe, just maybe, it’s the universe finally giving her a real purpose. Ignoring her husband’s skepticism, Darla goes to the parking garage rooftop, and at exactly 10:07 p.m., saves Jude Morrison from jumping. Darla shows him the text on her phone, and Jude assures her he kept his plan a secret—so how could anyone have known where he’d be at the precise moment his problems became too much to handle?

Darla embarks on an epic journey driven by mysterious texts to show up for three people—a young man addicted to drugs looking for love, a broken-hearted girl in the foster care system, and a war hero—when they need it the most. Desperate to live a meaningful life despite the consequences, Darla risks her job and marriage to immediately respond to each text sending her to save another life.

Secrets from the past connect Darla and those she saves to the messenger, and the four set out to find the seemingly clairvoyant person who rescued them. But when Darla loses her job and her husband leaves, she is caught between the past she took for granted and her adventure with new friends, and she must decide how much of herself she’s willing to give up to show up for others.

Bio: I am a professor, suicidologist, and mental health researcher. I speak nationally about suicide prevention and mental health, have published extensively in academic journals on these subjects, and am currently writing a book on equitable death care, coming out in late 2025. I’m a Hoosier and the setting of Clarkstown is imagined from our bevy of two-stoplight towns.

First 300:

The MRI machine is a panic-inducing tube of cold, loud horror. Her paper gown is indiscreet, and the chill forces her 80-year-old breasts to stand at attention, something she didn’t think they could still do. This discomfort is a small price to pay to find the cancer she’s sure has marched, guns blazing, into her brain. But still, this is a god-forsaken sixty-minute nightmare. The music they pipe through the earphones doesn’t help. She had asked for jazz, but now she wishes she’d asked for something louder, the stuff the kids listen to these days. Rap, she believes it’s called. Or that heavy metal screaming that has no melody but rattles your head. Anything to drown out the click, click, click, and the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh coming from all sides of this brightly lit tomb.

She waits for the results because she has nowhere else to be. She buys a plastic-wrapped sandwich and a nearly expired milk at the cafeteria, and walks down hallways, peeking into the rooms. She’s invading the privacy of the healing, wishing she was one of the ones healing. What is it they say? Oh, yes. Fuck cancer. She doesn’t use that kind of language, and her daughter would give her the “what for” if she said it out loud, but having terminal cancer gives you permission to say a lot of things you didn’t use to say.

She returns to the waiting room and holds her breath when they call her name. She expects the worst, something her father always told her to do. Her brain is filled with the Big C. Up to the brim like a cup of coffee. She knows it. It is the only explanation for the visions she’s been having.

","Okay so, I don’t know who to ask but here I am. I need help. I spent over 5k on an espresso setup. (Baratza Forte BG +  La Marzocco Linea Mini) Like, a WHOLE LOTTA MONEY. It’s all fancy and has all these buttons, and I thought I was gonna be like, a coffee wizard or some sh\*t. People on Reddit said it was the “best” and “you’ll make coffee like a pro,” and I was like, “Yeah, okay, that’s me.”

I spent all this time watching James Hoffman vids and dialing in and etc. But guess what?? I’ve been using it for like 2 months now, and the coffee is not good. Like sometimes it’s decent, but most of the time it tastes like burnt rubber or I mess up the shot or the pressure is off or SOMETHING. I spend more time fiddling with the damn machine than drinking coffee, and I just can’t make it work. I've spent like $400 on beans to try and find one that doesn't suck. Every morning I spend like 20 minutes just trying to make a cup, and I’m over it. The whole thing is a damn ritual now.

At work, I’ve been using a Mr. Coffee machine. The $20 machine you get at Walmart. And it uses Folgers. And you know what? The coffee from that thing is WAY BETTER than the $5,000 setup. It’s like, actually good. It brews quick, it’s strong, it’s hot, and it actually tastes like coffee. Not this burnt, bitter garbage my $5,000 machine is making. It’s stupid how much better it is. 

I'm literally just sitting here with this big ass espresso machine in my kitchen feeling like a chud and I don’t know what the f\*ck to do. I’m thinking about just selling the whole thing on Facebook Marketplace or something. I just wanna get my money back and move on. But I don’t know how to sell this thing without looking like a complete fool. How do I explain this to someone without saying “yeah, I spent 5k and it sucks, but here, you can have it for half off”?

Someone please tell me how to sell this junk. Do I just post it and say ""it’s all setup but it’s literally just not worth it”?? Or do I just cut my losses and get rid of it?

After playing Chapter 1 and his free-time events however, I was shocked at how much I loved him to the point he's my second favorite after Eva. His FTE's showed he was actually a lot more caring, intelligent and sentimental than I initially expected. The reveal that Tozu got his information off of the internet, including false rumors, made me believe that he wrote the character bios that can be found on the official account.

Just shy of completing 5 years with my beloved Nexon, and it’s completed the 50k-mark this winter. It’s been a more-than-satisfactory ownership experience, and honestly a proud decision to have invested in this beast as my first car!

Things I Love:
1. Reliability: Yes, that may come as a shocker for many 😂 But this car has waded through Delhi-Gurgaon floods, extensive road trips and endless traffic jams without giving me any major problems as such.
2. Safety: it’s stayed true to its 5 star safety rating. We’ve had a one incident where a drunk tempo driver rammed into my car. His vehicle was squashed, but my car was absolutely fine with just a broken taillight. Oh and yes - My family inside didn’t feel a thing!
3. Speakers - one of the other USPs I really vouched for at the time of buying were the Harman speakers and they’re still the best in class imo. 

Things I Hate:
1. Worst cup holders, poor storage spaces versus Maruti or Hyundai cars. I always regret not having a stable flask holder for my coffee on my drives to office. 
2. Throw of the headlight on low beam is extremely poor. Might seriously consider upgrading to better headlamps next year. 
3. City drive mode (of the 3 drive modes) is honestly really badly tuned. It gives lower mileage than Sports mode, is really jerky and works poorly when there are 3-4 passengers. I’ve actually used sports mode the most for my daily drives alone as well, getting mileage between 13-14 kmpl in city traffic. 

On a side note - I also feel that 2019 Nexons were far better built than the current day Tata cars. I believe it’s got more to do with the fact that Tata was a brand fighting to reach the top spot that time, which meant they had better quality control, better paint quality, better products overall. Now that it’s a proper mass brand and their dealerships experience is awful, I truly hope Tata finds its way back to the 2019-zone which made me, a first time buyer at the age of 24, truly trust them with my hard earned money!",6,1735492622.0,CarsIndia,5,1.0,False

Since I have put the books in the living room, he has developed what can only be described as an obsession. He is no longer interested in his own books and reading them, his first act when he wakes in the morning is to find the books. Before he even eats his breakfast he has to pull these books down and flick through each page, to which he gives the occasional ’wow’ - his favourite word atm - once he’s done, he brings it over so we can read pages and flick through the photos.

For the last couple months I generally have the same schedule every night:

* Fall asleep at around 11 PM
* Wake up at 3 AM to pee, fall back asleep pretty quickly 
* Wake up at around 5-5:30 AM. I usually feel stressed when I do, like i'm not just waking up but I'm wired / heart is racing etc. Sometimes I'm having dreams, though usually not 'disturbing' dreams, just sorta neutral ones that I wake up from feeling high-alert. I usually can't fall asleep again, so I'll sometimes get up, though sometimes I toss and turn a bit until my alarm goes off around 7. 

I definitely feel and look like I'm not sleeping enough, but I'm not really sure what to do about it. Here are some habits I already took up and that have helped me in the past:

* Vitamin D
* Daily walk around 7 AM (when I'm supposed to wake up, even if I was already up)
* Workout after my walk, usually weights, cardio or a mix
* Journaling + therapy for mental health
* Yoga - usually at the end of the day for 30-60 min
* Eating healthy i.e. not too much processed stuff, mostly home cooked, etc
* No caffeine / alcohol (Tbh i haven't really noticed a connection in the past with these 2 and my sleep schedule, but I just find that it's one less thing to worry about. Also I do drink a bit of decaf tea / coffee which I consider low risk but open to hearing otherwise, I know decaf is technically still caffeinated, but seems like a low amount).

As far as I know I don't have sleep apnea, I've done two different at home tests. I'm trying to get a sleep study scheduled but I doubt this is the issue. 

Anything else we can think of? I do have anxiety, but right now honestly sleep is the only thing actively bothering me. Work is mostly going well, I'm young and otherwise healthy.

A couple days ago, a guy sitting next to me on a train was (probably) flirting - he helped me put on my coat, carried my suitcase, bought me coffee, and even offered me his book (because I said it looks good). He was very good looking and charming. When the train stopped, I thanked him and quickly left, and he looked truly disappointed. It didn't occur to me until today that he probably wanted to chat. 

Last week another man at the gym asked me if I know any good places for coffee. He also mentioned he had no plans after the gym. I gave him a recommendation and left right away. It took a full day to get that he might wanted me to join him.

This happens to me at least once or twice a month. My friends joke that a man could get on one knee with a ring, and I still wouldn't get that he's interested. My first instinct is to run away, despite being clearly attracted to most of those guys.

What can I do? I haven't dated anyone in 2 years, but before, dating was extremely easy. Now I feel like I'm destined to spend my days drinking whiskey on the pier watching seven otters that I'll probably adopt in the future.

I would appreciate any advice, or even explanation on why this happens.

1hp0ct6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1hp0ct6/the_working_class_is_stupid_and_i_understand_why/,"The working class is stupid, and I understand why the rich disrespect them","


I understand why the rich enslave the poor because the working class is actually okay with being slaves for the rest of their lives.

The working class is stupid and delusional. They believe the fairytales that hard work, ambition, and perseverance will make them rich.  
And the ""plebs"" believe that. Every single poor person believes that work will make them free.  

It is completely understandable why the rich despise the poor.  

When the rich spit on the poor, the poor are sure it’s raining. They are that stupid.  

The poor will cry that they work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, have no free time, and earn too little.  
And yet, at the same time, they’ll go to McDonald’s or Starbucks to buy overpriced coffee. They make the rich richer because the idea of buying something from the rich makes them feel elite.  

Instead of supporting their working-class people, they’d rather buy from enemy -big corporations  to feel elite. They’ll buy clothes from Louis Vuitton to feel prestigious, still supporting the rich.  

Even though workers at Amazon have poor working conditions and low wages, the working class keeps buying from Amazon, and the cycle never ends.  They don't bother about that how bad employees are treated. They won't unite with their class, becouse they are actually ashamed of being associated with poor. That's why people will brag about their perfect life on social media hiding the fact they are poor.


At work, instead of coming together, there are always bootlickers who want to climb the ladder and get promoted. They exploit their colleagues and take advantage of them for personal gain. Instead of uniting, they tear each other down.  

The same goes for soldiers and police. They earn ridiculously little but still protect the rich because they are brainwashed into believing that in 10 years, they’ll be promoted and become wealthier.  

Wars are possible becouse all these poor belive if they will be submissive they will be promoted and eventually become rich.


If the working class were united against the rich, they wouldn’t have to wait 10, 20, or 30 years to afford the house and live their dream life. If the working class united, they could dictate conditions, and companies would be ruined without workers. Without people, these companies are worthless.  
However, the working class is stupid to the bone.  

This is the last call because soon, AI will replace labor. This is the ultimate goal of the rich. The rich need a workforce to generate profits, and they depend on people. But when they successfully replace labor with AI, it will be the ultimate end for the working class. All the money will accumulate in the hands of the rich, and the rest of you will die of starvation.  
It is more and more difficult to afford a house and it's be more difficult to earn money in feature.



I’m really disgusted by those people who are saying that Luigi Mangione did wrong because Thomphos didn’t deserve to be killed, that he deserved a rightful jury, and that Luigi had no right to deliver justice himself.

This is a blatant example of a slave mentality—a bootlicker who was told fairytales about being a ""good human"" and going to heaven. They’ve been indoctrinated into believing that nobody has the right to deliver justice themselves, and they cling to the idea that being a ""good person"" will eventually be rewarded.

But they fail to see or realize that the rich don’t follow these so-called rules of being good. The rich live like the rules are for the poor, not for them. They have no ethical code. They enslave the poor, exploit them, and build a world designed for the wealthy.

And when a single poor person takes action against the rich, these same poor slaves condemn it, calling it ""wrongful."" They believe the rich follow the same ethics as everyone else, so they think they too must follow the rules and be obedient sheep.

The rich kill people daily. They send the poor to wars, using them as tools, and don’t care about their lives.  

The rich will never mourn the life of a soldier who dies on the battlefield. To them, his life was worthless.

The difference between the rich and the poor is this: when the poor kill a rich person, there will always be dumb poor slaves who mourn the rich, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""unethical."" They believe in fairness and justice even when the system is rigged against them. The poor dumb and fully deserve to be slaves. They are slaves becouse in fact they are okay with being slaves.",0,1735491902.0,CapitalismVSocialism,10,0.29,False

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon

🕕 2PM - 10PM

I actually have a few other establishments up in line to review before this, but I really want to gush about this place so please bear with me on this haphazard write-up. And a quick disclaimer: I don't drink a lot of alcohol because too much intake triggers an allergy, so I may not be the best authority on cocktails and shit. Best I can do is describe the taste of the cocktail, and you can decide for yourself if it's something you’d like.

If you are interested in the review for the drinks, please go to the *We ordered* section ~~kay mag-talambuhay pa ko hahaha~~ as I have a lot to say. 

**Discovering Owl Bookshop and Bar**\
~~(pwede ra gyud mo mu-skip ani kay mao na ni ang talambuhay)~~\
We were on our way from LK Bakery to the Tea and Gallery when we decided to pass by Atúa Midtown since we realized that it was on the way. It was around ~1pm when we were window-shopping through the stores (a couple of them were closed until 2pm) when a Star Wars display caught my sister's eye. From there, we saw the books on display (which included the Conjugal Dictatorship, Earthsea, the Dune books, and other titles that will make a nerd drool). The door to the shop says that it was to open at 2PM, but the ~~barista~~ bartender inside still opened the shop for us and assured us that we can peruse the books inside though he can't serve drinks at the moment. 

**The Place**
This place is a nook for introverts. There's a shelf for books, a traditional piano, then an area with a latticed screen and little doors on the table where your orders are going to be served. It's actually not very spacious, it's super intimate, and three groups inside could already fill up the space.

The books on the shelves are varied: some classics, some niche. You'll see that there are books with orange stickers on them, and apparently, these are the ones *not* for sale. 

The barista also mentioned that if you donate a book, you’ll get a free drink! ~~(to be verified in a future visit)~~

**Ordering**\
You find their menu through a QR Code placed on the tables. I’m putting up screenshots of the menu for reference. You can pay via cash, GCash or Paymaya. (*Pang introvert gyud ni nga pamaagi kay no contact ang pag order ug pagbayad hahahaha*)

**We ordered:**
🍺 To Build a Snowman (₱250): This is one of their seasonal drinks, and it shows: coffee latte that's spiced with cinnamon and star anise and spiked with what we thought was jägermeister (turns out that it was vodka, though). The cinnamon stick garnish also serves as its stirrer, and it's probably best to mix everything together before you drink. You can taste the milk, cinnamon and alcohol together; interestingly, I can't taste coffee. It's a bit on the strong side, though, so you may want to take your time in drinking it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

🍹Tequila Sundown (₱200): Not sure what the difference is between this and tequila sunrise because the menu indicates that this still uses the traditional grenadine syrup (instead of the blackberry brandy usually used for tequila sunset), but it doesn't really matter because it's a smooth, refreshing drink. The orange and lemon juices are prominent, and I didn't find the tequila harsh or biting. I don't drink alcohol much, but this was easy to drink. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

🍮 Mango Peach Pannacotta (₱250): The menu indicates that this was from Nomnom Desserts Cebu. The fruits really go well with the cooked cream (I mean, you can't really go wrong with mangoes and peaches together). I appreciate that sweetened cream was used; usually when there is panna cotta, establishments would use milk. But this panna cotta is thick and the fruit toppings were generous. My gripe would be the size (as I was hoping for more given its price) and that it was served in a broken container. Taste was still good, though. ⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Other things to rate:**\
🖊️Pricing: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ I don't have much reference for cocktail prices because I don't frequent bars, but I think that was a fair price point. I've seen more expensive ones (Dosage, Europe) and cheaper ones, so I think the pricing here is on the industry standard category (do correct a girl in the comments kay basin nagbuot buot ra ko hahahaha)\
🖊️ Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The bartenders were very kind and accommodating. They interacted when needed and left you alone when you needed space. They answered our questions courteously and were very patient with us.\
🖊️ Aesthetic (Instagram-ability+Tiktok-ability): ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ this place was made for introverts and tiktokers... Very cutesy, very demure, very novel. Hidden gem hole in the wall kind of feel.\
🖊️ location: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ kinda near the main road but sudlonon lang. If you're using public transportation, you'll have to walk. The good things, though, are that: (1) there is parking and (2) it's close to other establishments that you might want to visit, such as LK Bakery, Luna Gazette (which is within the same compound) and other creative stores in the compound.

**Some thoughts off the bat:**\
🖊️ For a place that places *Bookshop* on its store name, there's actually just a few books for sale.\
🖊️ No meals here, in case you were wondering\
🖊️ The thing that endears this establishment to possible patrons is the thing that also limits it: the small space. It's a great idea for the target demographic, but it limits the number of customers. The place actually gets filled up real fast, and they may lose prospect customers because of the small space.

**I would highly recommend this if:**\
🖊️ You want to try something new\
🖊️ You’re on a date\
🖊️ A close friend or relative is visiting you from Manila (or wherever) and you wanna show them somewhere unique here in Cebu

**Closing thoughts:**\
It was such a pleasant surprise for us to find a hole in the wall establishment in such an unassuming place. It’s a cute, cool concept with decent offerings and good books—just don't bring too much of a crowd.",14,1735491509.0,CebuRestaurantReviews,2,1.0,False

It was a tough month or so cold turkey quitting after 4 years of smoking and another 12 years of vaping. It was one of the hardest things I've done as before (subconsciously) my entire schedule involved my mod and making plans, etc., always involved an element of 'is there a place I can drag on my mod here?'. 

But I did it, and I've been vape-free for a year. I've hung around people vaping and even occasionally taken hits from friend's vapes while drinking out, and it's always been fine. But this Christmas, my friend asked me to keep a disposable - he said it was almost over and that he needed a new one anyway. Came home, sat at my desk and occasionally hit it while having my coffee, working, etc. All the while, musing about how this was a daily thing and how much I was hooked on it before.

But then the fucking thing just went ahead and ran out of juice.

Like a fungus steadily growing through my limbic system, the hauntingly familiar sensations of nic craving starting working its way through my brain. Mind you, it's 100% mental but it's so persistent and so easy to give in. I hit up this sub after almost an year and started looking for posts where users relapsed ""just for a bit"" and quit right after. I couldn't find any. I drove up to my local vape store, parked but stopped myself from getting out of the car. I just drove away, my cravings screaming bloody murder tinged with regret. 

It's day 3 and it's still hard. I can't believe a single day of vaping can do this to me. And I realized what did it for me the occasional hitting the vape while sitting at home - a familiar setting, after a sip of coffee, after eating - a familiar routine. Even after being introduced for a short amount of time, my brain found those accursed neural pathways lit them up again and now it's routine again. You need a hit of your vape while the after taste of coffee is on your tongue, You need the throat hit of nic to accompany a sip of whiskey.

It's day 3 and I'm still struggling. My mind's telling me it's fine to quit quitting for a bit. That the nic rush feels so nice. That I did a good job (1 whole year buddy!! Good job!) and that it's a deserved reward. 

My logic and my experience says none of the above is true. For almost an year I did not need to vape. I never craved it. I wasn't missing anything. All I was, was richer, less anxious and had much less heartburn.

I need a safe space to scream into the void a bit. So to start the past few weeks have been chaos as Im sure everyone has experienced. Holidays, kids off from school, non stop shit going on. In my case I have two close friends right now who have been leaning on me to help them out(nothing too crazy but just extra stress) and I have been BUSY. Every day has been taken up by some thing or another and this past month in particular has been extra busy. I was also sick at the beginning of the month and thats probably where this all started. The house is TRASHED. Beyond disgusting. I have not had a second to even think about cleaning. When I try to clean it gets messed up immediately because my partner sucks. My partner has allowed our child to be rude to me and they both treat me very badly. I am currently on my period and I get bad cramps and bleed pretty heavy and its absolutely miserable. I woke up this morning and felt AWFUL. I decided to take a bath to help the cramps and it usually helps move some stuff out. I kept getting interrupted by my daughter because she had to go to the bathroom. There are two toilets in the house but she doesnt like the downstairs one because its ""got spiders"" and its also disgusting right now. Because if I dont do every fucking god damn thing in this house it will never get done. My partner could have gotten up off her ass and cleaned the toilet for her. Instead she just kept bothering me while I was trying to relax and feel better. I cut my bath short so she could use the toilet. She was literally in the bathroom for TWO MINUTES. TWO FUCKING MINUTES after acting like she had to go so bad and the other toilet wasnt good enough. Why cant my partner clean and take the initiative? Why does all of this shit fall on us to remember and do? Why cant my partner pick up on what needs to be done and fucking do it? If she does clean its half ass and awful. She ""cleaned"" our daughters room but its not organized and its still a mess. She just takes things and puts it in boxes that I have to deal with later. When she cleans she half finishes something then says shes done. Her idea of cleaning is picking up two things off the floor and shes cleaned. She never ever finishes the job ever. She does dishes and leaves nasty food and crap in the sink along with silverware and other random shit because she cant be bothered to finish. It takes my entire fucking day to clean up after her after she has claimed she already cleaned. To top all this off I get treated like absolute dog shit. My 9 year old screams at me all the time when I ask a simple question. My partner takes our childs side and allows her to think she can do whatever she wants. It is them against me. And I will admit that I am far from perfect, I had a pretty bad alcohol problem and have done some shitty things in the past but I have always tried to be here and help clean and I also pay to live here too. Its a literal constant battle to clean and have people be nice to me. Why cant she take the fucking initiative and clean the bathroom? Why is it always on me to do everything? When I ask its always just a laundry list of excuses and reasons why it isnt happening. But she has all the time in the world to play a computer game and sit and watch cartoons. She never picks up the slack. She claims she cleaned the living room this morning but it looks exactly the same as it did last night. She also accidentally broke the coffee pot so thats great. I just dont know how much more of this I can handle. I am starting to resent her so fucking much and I hate being home because its a constant attack on me no matter how nice I try to be or calm or loving I keep getting shit on. Its them against me. All of the chaos and stress depresses me so much that I can barely function or motivate myself to clean. I just want my shitty partner to clean the fucking bathroom for once in her life and clean up after herself and our child. I cant do it all. She doesnt care enough to keep things clean.

I want a divorce and so does she but its so much more complicated than just getting a divorce. We own a home together and it isnt as easy as just moving out and getting divorced like everyone seems to think. But this past month has really pushed me over the edge.

I am thinking of just leaving no review as it just seems bad run all around - our first after 8 guests stay.  We are new and only have 2 airbnb reviews and feel like I have more to lose with the car break in a review than being honest about unsanitary guests.  Maybe I should expect this amount of dirtiness after a 5 days stay?  Should I add potty trained requirement for future guests? 

  
Guest experience-

Power outage before they got there and oven didnt work because you have to hit a button to reset - was able to go over and take care of within 30 minutes. Guest proclaimed not tech savy and would not troubleshoot

On the 26th their car was broken into because they left valuables and the doors unlocked.  They say they didnt leave the door unlocked but neighbors all have the same guy on camera moving on once they try the door and its locked.  

No umbrellas

Struggled with tv and that we only provide netflixs

  
Check out-

The place was left -

\-Broken kitchen tongs

\-Broke into the cleaning cabinent

\-Stole a full bottle of costco bodywash

\-Guests have been leaving expensive coffee for the next guests, they took all that coffee and left a can of folgers

\-Black scum in hot tub

\-Food on every surface and handle

\-Urine on the bathroom floors

So far it’s been working like a charm. But for the last 2 days, it’s not dispensing coffee from the portafilter. When I remove the portafilter, it pops and all the trapped water makes a mess. Things I have already tried:
1) Cleaned the portafilter to make sure the hole is not clogged. 
2) Tried using no pressure filter to see if that does the trick.
3) Took the screen out to thoroughly clean and to see if it was clogged.
4) Ran a descaling cycle to clear up any buildup.

We do not have kids. I’m not the type of guy who thinks just because I work and she doesn’t, she should do everything else. I cook most of our meals, help with dishes, and do what I can around the house. But I’ll admit – I procrastinate, sometimes a lot, a personality trait I have been struggling with since my childhood.

A few days ago, she asked me to do the ironing on the weekend since she was out with her family most of the weekdays that week. I said I’d do it later because I had to apply for new jobs. By the evening, I was mentally drained. She was tired too, and when she went to bed, I asked if I could do the ironing the next day. She said okay. But instead of resting, I played video games for a while.

The next day, she wanted to organize my room with me. I wasn’t into it, but I didn’t say anything. As we cleaned, we found a months-old, rotting piece of cake in my work bag in a place I never use. I remember getting that piece there a few months ago but totally forgot about it. She got really upset and said, “Whenever you procrastinate, I have to deal with it.”

I tried to play it cool and lighten the mood, but she was clearly getting more annoyed. By nighttime, she softened, and we reconciled without actually talking about the issue. I know we should have talked when possible, but we were both busy throughout the week. She had a huge number of guests to visit her in a few days, I had a very busy week in my job, and I was trying to find a new job in whatever free time I had.

Fast forward a few days later – I had a packed schedule with meetings and job applications, but I still managed to make breakfast and clean up the kitchen before she woke up. I then proceeded to work a little and joined a few meetings until I had to go to the office to deliver a document.

She had been cooking all day for her upcoming guests. When I was finally free and took the dog out around 6 PM, she said, “Oh, now you walk the dog?” I told her I’d been swamped, and she just rolled her eyes. I walked the dog the previous night, by the way – she does 2 walks a day 90% of the time.

Later, I tried to get close and help with dishes, but she exploded. She said, “It’s been four days! I forgave you without talking, but ever since we got married, I’m the one dealing with everything you put off! Set your priorities straight!”

I tried explaining that I thought walking the dog later was okay, but she stormed out. I have to add, walking the dog is not exclusively my responsibility, but whenever I am available, I do it. I stayed home, cleaned the kitchen, and waited. She went to her friend’s place and didn’t return until late. I couldn’t sleep, so I tracked her location on Find My (we share locations) and saw she was just sitting in the car for 15 minutes after getting home. When I went to check on her, she locked the doors and ignored me.

I waited outside in the cold for half an hour before giving up and waiting inside near the door. After she didn’t come in for 15 minutes, I went to check on her again. She eventually rushed past me, locked herself in her dressing room, and slept in a separate room.

The next morning, I had a full-day workshop that I was a moderator of. I woke up early and rushed to work at 6 AM. The guests were coming that day, but I was not invited as it was a girls’ night. After leaving work at 6 PM, I just sat in my car around the city until 1 AM. When I went home, there were no guests, and she appeared to be rushed to bed, stopping whatever she was doing. I just went near her and kissed her, then proceeded to clean up the rest of the house.

When I was done, I went to bed, but she was in the bathroom. I was waiting for her but fell asleep. When I woke up, she was not sleeping with me. She was in another room. I made her breakfast and left a rose I picked up while walking the dog. I left it by her side with a kiss, but she didn’t react. I made her coffee later and told her it was in the kitchen. She didn’t acknowledge me.

Since then, we haven’t spoken. She barely leaves her room, and I check in occasionally to see if she needs anything. I noticed she’s writing on her computer and hides the screen when I pass by.

I have another post explaining more about the break up. 

Long story short, we had been in contact during this two months. Mostly started by her. We had spoke about the reasons why we broke up. But still we both care a lot about the other and the feelings of love and longing are clear. We chat, we laugh and support each other. 

One week ago I told her that I’m coming back to her town to re start my life. Work, hobbies, friends and of course to see her. I really like that place and my life there. So going back is my choice even over what could happen with her. 

She was really receptive about it, and happy that I’m going back. She literally said that she wants to meet up the moment I arrive so we can go for a coffee beers or whatever. 

I think, even I’m doing this because I grow to really like that place and that feels as home, I would really like for something to happen between us.

Deep within the halls of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) network, a new legend was born—a legend that starts with Bob. But Bob wasn’t just content being a groundbreaking Layer 2 blockchain; no, Bob wanted something more… something fun. So, Bob did what only Bob could do: Bob birthed Boob. Yes, you read that right—Boob.

A Tale of Bob-on-Bob Greatness

Picture this: Bob, the stoic yet quirky blockchain titan, sitting atop the ICP ecosystem, sipping on digital coffee. One day, Bob looked at the meme coin universe and said, “Why let Doge and Shiba have all the fun? I’ve got layers. I’ve got BOB-ness. I can create the ultimate meme coin!”

And thus, $Boob was forged in the fires of meme ingenuity. It wasn’t just another coin; it was the ultimate expression of Bob-on-Bob synergy.

Why $Boob? Why Now?

Because the world needed Boob. It needed a coin that represents chaos, laughter, and the undeniable allure of a name that’s impossible to forget. Boob isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement. It’s Bob saying, “Here, hold my transaction ledger. Let’s make this fun.”

The Boob Ecosystem: Where the Magic Happens

Boob fits into the BOB ecosystem like a perfectly timed punchline. Every transaction, every laugh, every meme posted in its honor fuels the entire system. It’s like Bob put on a party hat, and every miner, user, and enthusiast showed up to celebrate.

The more Boob thrives, the more Bob flexes. And when Bob flexes, the whole ICP network feels the vibes.

Boobonomics: Because Numbers Matter (Kinda)

Let’s be real: Boob isn’t here to bore you with charts and stats. It’s here to bring chaos to order and order to chaos. It’s here to make you laugh while still being part of something bigger.

When you buy Boob, you’re not just investing in a coin. You’re investing in the spirit of Bob-on-Bob greatness. You’re becoming part of the memevolution.

Join the Boob Movement

So, why are you still reading this? Boob is calling, and it’s time to answer. Whether you’re here for the memes, the chaos, or just to say, “Yeah, I own Boob,” you’re welcome.

Get in. Buckle up. And remember: this is Bob-on-Bob history in the making. Boob is here, and it’s not just a meme—it’s a mission.

The Emotional Impact of Handmade Gifts in Celebrating Special Occasions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Handmade gifts carry a special significance that goes beyond their physical form. They embody thoughtfulness and creativity, making them ideal for celebrating special occasions. When you choose to create or give a handmade gift, you are sharing a part of yourself and your emotions with the recipient, making the moment even more memorable.

One of the most profound emotional impacts of handmade gifts is the level of personalization they offer. When you craft a gift, you have the unique ability to tailor it to the specific tastes and preferences of the person you’re honoring. This thoughtful gesture shows that you have taken the time to consider what would truly make them happy. Unlike mass-produced items, handmade gifts are rich in personal stories and experiences.

Another emotional aspect of handmade gifts is the effort that goes into creating them. The process of making something by hand is often time-consuming and requires dedication. This investment of time and labor translates into the significance of the gift itself. The recipient is likely to feel appreciated and cherished when they receive something that was made especially for them. This emotional bond can be particularly impactful during significant life events, such as birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations.

Gifts forged from creativity also foster a sense of connection and shared memories. Imagine giving a hand-painted mug to your best friend, one that contains designs representing your favorite inside jokes. Every time they enjoy their morning coffee, they’re reminded of you and the experiences you’ve shared. These tangible reminders can evoke feelings of warmth and affection, bridging emotional distances created by time or geography.

Additionally, handmade gifts often tell stories. They can represent a cherished memory, a shared interest, or a future dream between the giver and the recipient. For instance, a scrapbook filled with photos and mementos from your travels together can speak volumes about your friendship. It celebrates not just your bond, but the moments that you shared, creating a lasting legacy of your relationship.

These gifts can also instill a sense of nostalgia. Objects inherently carry memories. A handcrafted ornament that you create to celebrate a holiday can bring back loving memories of family gatherings, blending past and present. Nostalgia can be a powerful emotion, and handmade gifts often invoke a sense of comfort and familiarity that is hard to replicate with store-bought items.

Here are some creative ideas for handmade gifts that can enhance emotional value during special occasions:

- **Customized Photo Books:** Gather photographs and create a personalized album showcasing memorable moments.
- **Handmade Jewelry:** Design a unique piece that resonates with the recipient’s style.
- **Memory Jars:** Fill a jar with notes containing shared memories or reasons why you appreciate the person.
- **Knitted Items:** Knit a scarf or a hat, infusing warmth and care into your gift.
- **Artistic Paintings:** Create a piece of art that symbolizes your relationship or shared experiences.
- **Handcrafted Candles:** Made with scents that remind the recipient of special occasions or places.
- **Personalized Mugs:** Hand paint or engrave a mug that reflects their personality.
- **Themed Basket:** Fill a basket with curated items based on their interests, all with a personal touch.
- **Embroidered Textiles:** Make and personalize a pillow cover or blanket with meaningful quotes or images.
- **Cookbook of Favorite Recipes:** Compile a collection of recipes that are special to your relationship.

Creating and giving handmade gifts can transform the way we celebrate special occasions. The emotional weight they carry often surpasses that of standard gifts, offering a unique way to express love and appreciation. Perhaps the most meaningful aspect is the stories that each gift embodies. It’s not simply about the physical object; it’s about the connection, the memory, and the love that it represents.

In a world that often prioritizes convenience, handmade gifts remind us to cherish the moments we share with others. They encourage us to invest our time and energy into relationships, yielding bonds that grow deeper and more meaningful. So, the next time you’re looking for a gift, consider the emotional impact you can create with something made by hand.

### Conclusion

When considering a gift, the thoughtfulness behind the choice often speaks volumes. Personalized pyrography art not only showcases your creativity but also brings a unique flair that store-bought items can never replicate. By employing innovative pyrography techniques, you can create distinctive pieces that reflect the recipient's personality, interests, or cherished memories. Whether it’s a custom-designed wooden keepsake or a beautifully adorned home decor item, these handcrafted creations demonstrate the effort and care you put into selecting a meaningful gift.

Moreover, the emotional impact of handmade gifts is undeniable. Celebrating special occasions with a present that is personalized and thoughtfully designed elevates the experience for both the giver and the recipient. Pyrography art carries with it a sense of warmth and intimacy, allowing you to express your feelings and appreciation in a way that resonates deeply. From birthdays and anniversaries to holidays and milestones, a personalized pyrography piece can become a treasured keepsake, eliciting fond memories for years to come.

Ultimately, embracing the art of pyrography is not just about honing a skill; it's about connecting with loved ones on a profound level. Gift-giving becomes an art form filled with sentiment and love. So, as you explore these creative pyrography ideas for gifts, remember that it’s the intention and effort behind each piece that truly makes it special. Your thoughtful creation can strengthen bonds and create lasting memories that your loved ones will cherish forever.",1,1735490527.0,Pyrographyhaven,0,1.0,False

TLDR: If having sugar free/aspartame drinks helps me avoid serious amounts of calories and sugar, do I really care about the possible health effects if it helps me lose weight? 

TLDRx2: Additionally, do I even care about aspartame if I have bigger concerns like vaping/smoking, being heavily inactive, etc???

I was put on diet pills by my dad in elementary, in the gym since middle school, almost got Gastric Bypass at 16 or 17 but chickened out. I was in the first pediatric bariatric group at that hospital, so it’s safe to say that I’ve tried most everything with no success.

I’ve been given mountains of conflicting information (thanks Internet!) over my lifetime of how to lose weight. I’m so confused, tired, frustrated, and nervous. Not knowing what to do freezes me in place and then I reach for comfort foods bc that’s all I know.

I’m sugar addicted, deal with lots of pain and often order food bc I can’t find the time to cook good healthy meals. And when I do, I hate meal prep bc it’s the same thing all week. 


I want to lose the weight, but I HAVE to start small and with something I know as basic: Less sugar = GOOD. I love soda and sweet coffees so much. Juices, lemonades, if I could live off of ‘em I would. I drink waaaay more sugar than I’ll eat, so I thought sugar free would be a good swap. 

HOWEVER everyone tells me I’ll get cancer, it’s gonna make me crave sugar and then I’ll eat sugar so it won’t matter, I’ll get pinholes in my teeth, etc etc etc. 
Can someone PLEASE tell me that I do not have to care that much about aspartame. I have so many bigger health issues like vaping, joint/eds problems, etc. 

I feel like drinking a couple Sunkist Zero’s in the day is the least of my concerns. Will that even help me lose weight though?

Sorry for the confusing mess of a post. Starting to unpack nearly 2 decades of weight loss grief lolol idk where to start",14,1735490386.0,loseit,47,0.8,False

Sometimes it's easy, other times it can ruffle some feathers. I'm happy I can avoid all of that.

I have a mini bar of hotel soap I keep next to my bathroom sink. It's not for washing hands, it's for washing soiled clothes. I realized today that I don't have to store it underneath the cabinet to make sure no one uses it for their hands. I don't have to explain it to a roommate/partner and risk having them think it's disgusting. I can just have it there without a second thought.

I can leave my pourover coffee maker draining in the sink once I'm done making coffee and I don't have to worry about someone pouring dirty dishwater over it. My ex used to do that all the time when we lived together. So I saved an old yogurt lid and sat it on the counter to keep my pourover until it was done draining. She started using the lid to store wet sponges. She argued with me when I asked her not to and explained what it was for. She finally dropped it after I pointed out the absurdity of the situation. (I think I said something along the lines of ""You're really going to stand there and deny me an old yogurt lid? I can't have a yogurt lid Jen?!)

If the post is still up, I'm still looking. Let's start this with a little about me. I am Em, a 21-year-old female. I consider myself a novella-length writer. I write around 500-1,000 words per post. I write exclusively in third person and on Discord. Lastly, I do enjoy spice, but it is never the main focus. I need some build-up to spice. The roles don't have to be slow burn, but they cannot be all about spice. One other thing before I forget: I work retail, so sometimes my replies are spotty, but you will get one a day for sure. 




So here is what I am looking for in a partner. You must be 18 or older, preferably 21. I would like you to match my length or at least put effort into your replies. I would also like you to understand the roles are not all about smut. I don't care which gender you are or which one you play. Oh, I am ghost friendly, but I will delete the servers after like a month of no activity. Anyway, let's get on to the roles! 





I am hoping to play the muse B role but I’m not really picky. 

**Roles**


1. Muse A is a rich person, the kind of rich person that is just an ass. That is until one morning while running late for work. Muse A runs into Muse B holding up the line at a coffee shop. Who knew meeting each other was just what they needed? 



2. Muse A is a cop or an FBI agent. They are the best in their field. So they are part of the task force to take down a cannibalistic serial killer. It's then that Muse A realizes it's a copycat. The original killer muse B is in prison and has been for a while. The two join forces to catch a killer. Eventually a professional relationship turns into something more. 



3. Muse A is a mob boss, the worst one New York has ever seen. Muse B is an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mob's inner circle to take them down. Only they never expect to fall in love with Muse A and his children. 



4. Muse A is a delinquent who was put in a program designed to straighten them out. Or perhaps they are undercover cops simply pretending to be. This is when they meet muse B. A serial killer in for life. The two do not get along until the fear creeps away, giving way to something else. 




5. Muse A is a vampire, and Muse B is a werewolf. The two species have hated each other for all of time. That is until Muse A moves into a new town smack in the middle of the werewolf's land. The problem comes when Muse B imprints on the vampire. The two are fated mates. Maybe this will solve all the problems. ",1,1735490181.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

The docs continued to give me pill after pill and brush me off. Told me that this was due to diet, alcohol, coffee, stress and NSAIDS (which I didn’t take..) I took ranitidine for about 6 years before they pulled it off the shelf due to its association with causing cancer. Also Pantoprazole, sucralfate, omeprozole, famotidine, the list goes on. Fast forward to 2020 and the docs finally decided to look into it further by scheduling my endoscopy. I thought I’d finally gain some clarity and figure this out. The results showed the typical “mild gastritis/inflammation” that so many of you have also been told. I then emailed the gastroenterologist that did my procedure with follow up questions, just to be ghosted. They didn’t even respond! 

So time moved forward, I kept having stomach pain. It is now 2024 and after another round of questions about my diet and coffee and blah blah, doc forwarded me to another gastroenterologist.

I understand why the rich enslave the poor because the working class is actually okay with being slaves for the rest of their lives.

The working class is stupid and delusional. They believe the fairytales that hard work, ambition, and perseverance will make them rich.  
And the ""plebs"" believe that. Every single poor person believes that work will make them free.  

It is completely understandable why the rich despise the poor.  

When the rich spit on the poor, the poor are sure it’s raining. They are that stupid.  

The poor will cry that they work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, have no free time, and earn too little.  
And yet, at the same time, they’ll go to McDonald’s or Starbucks to buy overpriced coffee. They make the rich richer because the idea of buying something from the rich makes them feel elite.  

Instead of supporting their working-class people, they’d rather buy from enemy -big corporations  to feel elite. They’ll buy clothes from Louis Vuitton to feel prestigious, still supporting the rich.  

Even though workers at Amazon have poor working conditions and low wages, the working class keeps buying from Amazon, and the cycle never ends.  They don't bother about that how bad employees are treated. They won't unite with their class, becouse they are actually ashamed of being associated with poor. That's why people will brag about their perfect life on social media hiding the fact they are poor.


At work, instead of coming together, there are always bootlickers who want to climb the ladder and get promoted. They exploit their colleagues and take advantage of them for personal gain. Instead of uniting, they tear each other down.  

The same goes for soldiers and police. They earn ridiculously little but still protect the rich because they are brainwashed into believing that in 10 years, they’ll be promoted and become wealthier.  

Wars are possible becouse all these poor belive if they will be submissive they will be promoted and eventually become rich.


If the working class were united against the rich, they wouldn’t have to wait 10, 20, or 30 years to afford the house and live their dream life. If the working class united, they could dictate conditions, and companies would be ruined without workers. Without people, these companies are worthless.  
However, the working class is stupid to the bone.  

This is the last call because soon, AI will replace labor. This is the ultimate goal of the rich. The rich need a workforce to generate profits, and they depend on people. But when they successfully replace labor with AI, it will be the ultimate end for the working class. All the money will accumulate in the hands of the rich, and the rest of you will die of starvation.  
It is more and more difficult to afford a house and it's be more difficult to earn money in feature.



I’m really disgusted by those people who are saying that Luigi Mangione did wrong because Thomphos didn’t deserve to be killed, that he deserved a rightful jury, and that Luigi had no right to deliver justice himself.

This is a blatant example of a slave mentality—a bootlicker who was told fairytales about being a ""good human"" and going to heaven. They’ve been indoctrinated into believing that nobody has the right to deliver justice themselves, and they cling to the idea that being a ""good person"" will eventually be rewarded.

But they fail to see or realize that the rich don’t follow these so-called rules of being good. The rich live like the rules are for the poor, not for them. They have no ethical code. They enslave the poor, exploit them, and build a world designed for the wealthy.

And when a single poor person takes action against the rich, these same poor slaves condemn it, calling it ""wrongful."" They believe the rich follow the same ethics as everyone else, so they think they too must follow the rules and be obedient sheep.

The rich kill people daily. They send the poor to wars, using them as tools, and don’t care about their lives.  

The rich will never mourn the life of a soldier who dies on the battlefield. To them, his life was worthless.

The difference between the rich and the poor is this: when the poor kill a rich person, there will always be dumb poor slaves who mourn the rich, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""unethical."" They believe in fairness and justice even when the system is rigged against them. The poor dumb and fully deserve to be slaves. They are slaves becouse in fact they are okay with being slaves.",0,1735489687.0,poor,24,0.4,False
1hozisz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hozisz/avatar_3_the_way_of_steel/,Avatar 3: The Way of Steel,"Colonel Mason Riggs stood on the observation deck of the ISV Venture, a worn patch on his sleeve marking his years of service. He ran a thumb over the scar that slashed across his jawline, his pale blue eyes locked onto the shimmering green world below.

“Helluva place to bring a gun this big,” he muttered, his voice gravelly from decades of chain-smoking Earth-grown cigarettes. ""Could be worse, though. Could be Detroit.""

Behind him, his XO, Lieutenant Carla ""Steel"" Morales, snorted. ""Sir, Detroit didn’t have six-legged horses or fifteen-foot-tall blue assholes trying to spear your face.""

Riggs half-turned, his lips curling into a grim smirk. ""Touché, Morales. Let’s just hope our new toy works. Would hate to see you end up a Na’vi hood ornament. And somebody get that goddamn coffee station down here workin' before I lose my mind.""

.

.

.

The air stank of grease, burnt foliage, and well, Hell's Gate. It was the RDA’s fortress, the last bastion of human control on this hostile moon. Massive durasteel walls surrounded the compound, bristling with automated turrets, motion scanners, and electrified fences designed to keep out the ever-encroaching jungle—and the Na’vi.

The Paladin MkVII, an ungodly fusion of RDA arrogance and Earth-based artillery design, loomed in the central courtyard like some grotesque metal god. Twin electromagnetic rails sat atop its massive, tank-like chassis, fed by conduits thick as tree trunks that pulsed with a sickly green glow. Engineers scurried over it like ants on a carcass, checking power couplings and ammunition feeds.

“Mother of Christ,” muttered Sergeant Damon “Dingo” O’Rourke as he approached with his fire team. His Australian accent was as thick as the cigarette clamped between his teeth. ""Thing’s got more juice than my ex-wife’s lawyer.""

Specialist Jodie Nguyen rolled her eyes. ""Keep dreaming, Dingo. The only thing you’ve got a chance of outlasting is a ham sandwich.""

O’Rourke grinned, but before he could retort, a voice barked over the comms. ""Cut the chatter and get to work! This isn’t a goddamn tour group.""

The voice belonged to Chief Engineer Tomás Hernandez, a wiry man with grease-stained hands and a perpetual scowl. He stood at the base of the Paladin, gesturing furiously at a group of techs struggling with a stubborn actuator.

“Somebody tell me why this three-billion-dollar war machine is acting like my grandma’s lawnmower!” Hernandez yelled, switching between Spanish curses and heavily technical jargon. ""¡Dios mío! If this actuator jams again, I’m shoving it up someone’s culo.""

The ammunition for the Paladin wasn’t standard. Nothing on Pandora ever was. Each shell, a hyperkinetic tungsten slug wrapped in a sheath of volatile Element 115, required a delicate touch during loading. One wrong move, and the results would be spectacular—and fatal.

“Alright, slow and steady, folks,” said Corporal Greg “Brick” Simmons, guiding the forklift carrying a shell the size of a goddamn tree trunk. His Brooklyn accent was thick enough to cut steel. ""Last thing I need today is a fuckin’ court-martial ‘cause you clowns dropped the payload.""

“Like you’d survive to face one,” Nguyen quipped, watching from the sidelines with a smirk.

Brick shot her a glare. ""Yeah, laugh it up, princess. We’ll see who’s laughing when this thing—""

The forklift hit a snag, jolting the shell. Everyone froze. A faint, high-pitched whine began to emanate from the casing.

“Oh, shit,” muttered Hernandez, his eyes wide.

But before anyone could panic further, Hernandez lunged forward with a calibrated stabilizer rod and jammed it into the shell’s diagnostics port. The whine subsided.

“See?” Brick said, his voice breaking slightly. ""Told you it was under control.""

""Uh-huh,"" Nguyen replied, unimpressed.

.

.

.

Hell’s Gate fell silent as personnel evacuated to safe distances. From the observation tower, Riggs watched the Paladin through armored glass. Morales leaned against the console next to him, her arms crossed.

“Give me the rundown,” Riggs said, not taking his eyes off the screens.

“Projectile speed: Mach 14,” Morales said. ""Yield: thirty kilotons conventional, plus the kick from the Element 115 reaction on impact. Target: simulated bunker complex six klicks out. If it works, nothing survives.""

""And if it doesn’t?"" Riggs asked.

Morales smirked. ""We get a fireworks show and a very awkward call to Earth HQ.""

“Load status?” Riggs barked into his comm.

“Shell secured,” Hernandez’s voice replied. ""Rail alignment nominal. All systems green. Ready to light this candle?""

“Light it,” Riggs ordered.

The Paladin powered up, the electromagnetic coils glowing fiercely. A low hum turned into a teeth-rattling roar as the rails charged. Inside the weapon, superconductors hummed with barely restrained power, shunting energy into the slug.

""Here it comes,"" Morales said, her voice tinged with anticipation.

The Paladin fired.

A blinding streak of light tore across the sky, punching through the dense atmosphere like a dagger through flesh. The slug hit its target zone with apocalyptic fury. The ground shook as a mushroom cloud of fire, dust, and shattered trees erupted into the air.

For a moment, silence reigned. Then, the comms crackled to life. ""Direct hit,"" someone reported from the field. ""Impact within two meters of target marker. Blast yield… uh, holy hell, that’s about twenty-fucking percent higher than expected.""

“Impact confirmed,” Morales said, reading the telemetry. ""Zone’s gone. No heat signatures, no movement. Just a crater.""

Riggs exhaled slowly. ""Well, shit. It works.""

From the distant observation point, O’Rourke clapped his hands, grinning. ""That’s how you bloody do it, mate!""

Nguyen wasn’t impressed. ""You’re celebrating like you did something other than watch.""

O’Rourke shrugged. ""Hey, it’s a team effort, love.""

.

.

.

As the dust settled, Hell’s Gate resumed its usual hum of activity. The test was a success, but the implications were grim. Riggs looked back at the feed, the glowing crater a stark reminder of the Pandora campaign’s escalating brutality.

""You think it’s enough?"" Morales asked softly.

Riggs shook his head. ""Never is. They’ll want it bigger, meaner. And we’ll give it to them until there’s nothing left of this rock but glass.""

Morales said nothing.

Deep in the forest, in the sacred grove of the Tree of Souls, Mo’at, the Tsahìk, knelt in communion with Eywa. Tendrils of her queue intertwined with the glowing fibers of the tree, the connection sending waves of pain and unease through her mind.



She saw fire, bright and violent, tearing through the jungle. Creatures screaming as their homes were obliterated. The humans' abomination burned not just the land but the very spirit of Eywa herself.



The vision shifted. She saw warriors clad in metal, their faces pale and alien, their hands red with blood. The great Paladin loomed, spitting fire and death. In its shadow, the Na’vi fell, their arrows breaking uselessly against its unyielding armor.



Mo’at’s eyes snapped open, tears streaming down her face. She staggered to her feet, gripping her staff for support. Neytiri, her daughter and a leader among the Omatikaya, caught her arm.



“What did you see, mother?” Neytiri asked urgently.



“Death,” Mo’at rasped. “Fire and death. The sky people have unleashed a demon beyond anything we have known.”



Neytiri’s lips tightened into a grim line. ""Then we must prepare. Eywa will not let them destroy her without a fight.",5,1735489661.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Here are a few things I’ve tackled so far:

Water

I switched to a [Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottle](https://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/non-insulated-water-bottles/products/plastic-free-water-bottle-27oz?variant=860232195), and finding one with *no plastic parts* was surprisingly difficult! Many “stainless steel” bottles still have plastic lids, and all bottles with straws are plastic. This bottle ticks all the boxes for me, and after two weeks of use, I’m loving it.

Coffee

This one’s tricky. Most of the coffee I drink is at work, and unfortunately, we use off-brand Nespresso capsules, which aren’t great for avoiding microplastics. I’ve been thinking about getting a KeepCup or something similar, but I’m hesitant—it’s not just the hassle of leaving work to buy coffee, but the cost can really add up over time.

I’m considering brewing coffee at home and storing it in a good thermos, but I’m unsure which type of coffee would taste best over time. I love a fresh cup, so this is still a work in progress. If you’ve found solutions for avoiding plastic in your coffee routine, I’d love to hear them!

Tea

We’re big tea drinkers at home, so I plan to switch to loose-leaf tea with tea infusers once we finish the tea bags we already have. Considering we drink at least three cups a day, it feels like an easy and impactful switch.

Food

I’m trying to be mindful about food packaging and cutting back on seafood (a big microplastic source). For storage, I’ve been using [Ikea 365+ glass containers](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ikea-365-food-container-with-lid-rectangular-glass-bamboo-s79567009/) for years—not even because of microplastics initially, but because they’re practical and look nice. They double as oven-safe trays, so they’re super versatile!

She leaves dishes everywhere, she leaves her iced coffe cups everywhere(half full with coffee), i come home from a long day of work and school to spilled wine on the table and dirty food everywhere. She never fails to get a new paper towl roll and leave the old one on the paper towel holder but put the new one right next to it.  She often times leaves presents for me. Its 3 am and i go to the bathroom and there is blood all over the seat..same situation happened the next month, but there being blood on the bathroom rugs. I asked her if ahe could please wash the rugs and clean up her mess..she yells at me and says i am in the wrong. I ended up having to clean the rugs and wash a bloody toilet at 3am. I have went to take a shower and there has been literal shit in the tub.

She doesnt shower often and it is very obvious to tell when she doesnt. I am 100% positive she has bv just from the smell alone.  I have talked to my grandmother about her habits and  i told her to talk to talk to her about it. Few days later my grandmother said she did but nothing has changed.

She does nothing but rot on the couch most of the time and my god..the couch fucking reeks. 

My girlfriend came over the other day and I invited her into the livingroom (i douched the couch in fabreeze several times before hand). We were sitting on the couch and she says “whats that smell”. at that point i knew it was my moms stinky funky smell coming off the couch. She often has friends over herself so i pray they dont think the smell is from me. 

Everytime i try and tell my mom “hey can we start doing such and such differently, i think itll help us out” she yells at me. And i mean fucking goes bat shit crazy. Yesterday i asked her this and nothing else “when was the last time you showered”..she crashes out and says “*name* what i do is none of your business, what i do does not concern you”.

Before you guys say “its mental illness” or whatever the hell. This lady has a therapist and goes every week, she is on meds, has a state certified job(with a master degree), knows right from fucking wrong.

Our latest disagreement was because she left cornbeef greese sitting in the pressure cooker for over a week. The kitchen smelled horrible and i had no idea why. When I figured it out i took out the grease and just put the dish in the sink. I texted her what happened and told her she needs to wash the dish as it was her mistake.She fucking snaps at me and said that i need to stay in a childs place. I wash all the dishes and clean up the house with no help and i need to stay in a childs place?? (Mind you, i am 17 i have my own car, a job, and i have offered to pay rent and or move out so i dont have to clean up after an adult baby. I have tried to leave and get out but she wont fucking let me leave). 


I always talk to her in the nicest way when trying to correct behavior (although it may not seem like it) 
I am going crazy. Fuckng insane. I am in high school and it is only me and my mom. I am tired of coming home from a long day of school and work and having to clean up after a big ass fucking 36 year old toddler. Yea sure she pays all the bills and what not but that does not justify this behavior especially since i have offered a to pay rent and help out on bills.


Call me ignorant all you want but i am just trying to understand why she may be like this and how i can fix it as it is purely embarrassing

E color diamonds are an excellent choice for those seeking near-perfect color without the premium of D grade. They offer:

* Exceptional colorless appearance, indistinguishable from D grade to the naked eye
* Rarity (less than 1% of global diamond supply)
* Price difference: A 1.00 carat E VS1 diamond costs $5,830 while a similar D color diamond costs $6,040, a 3.6% price difference

* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A 2.00 carat E color with VVS1 clarity natural diamond is sold for $30,370, while a similar lab-grown diamond is sold for $3,450, a 780% difference!

* Strong investment potential
* The average price of a 1.00 carat E color diamond is $6,476
* Alternatively, you can save significantly more if you choose a near colorless grade. For example, the average price of a 1.00 carat H color diamond is $4,125, approximately 57% price difference.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone..

I understand why the rich enslave the poor because the working class is actually okay with being slaves for the rest of their lives.

The working class is stupid and delusional. They believe the fairytales that hard work, ambition, and perseverance will make them rich.  
And the ""plebs"" believe that. Every single poor person believes that work will make them free.  

It is completely understandable why the rich despise the poor.  

When the rich spit on the poor, the poor are sure it’s raining. They are that stupid.  

The poor will cry that they work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, have no free time, and earn too little.  
And yet, at the same time, they’ll go to McDonald’s or Starbucks to buy overpriced coffee. They make the rich richer because the idea of buying something from the rich makes them feel elite.

Wars are possible becouse all these poor belive if they will be submissive they will be promoted and eventually become rich.


If the working class were united against the rich, they wouldn’t have to wait 10, 20, or 30 years to afford the house and live their dream life. If the working class united, they could dictate conditions, and companies would be ruined without workers. Without people, these companies are worthless.  
However, the working class is stupid to the bone.  

This is the last call because soon, AI will replace labor. This is the ultimate goal of the rich. The rich need a workforce to generate profits, and they depend on people.

1hozd7b,https://i.redd.it/q5g1egmict9e1.png,I forgot to give at least some information about him. Meet Max,"Max is an ordinary child who had friends, loving parents, hobbies, and enemies. One day he and his friends decided to play a game that was rumored to be possessed... or contained someone's soul. Since Maksimka was the “leader” of his friend group, he decided to go in first and check what was wrong with it. After he entered it, the connection with his friends disappeared, he lost consciousness and woke up in some kind of white space. And then everything is simple for him, he was caught by the guardian of this place, tortured for several years, but Max was able to fight back with the help of an artifact that this guardian is guarding. He could not return home, so he was left to live alone with the guard, and with other people who accidentally ended up here


and now some facts

he's a big sonic fan
his favorite food is mac n cheese
he once accidentally gave his father parrot seeds instead of coffee because he wanted to prank his friend
and yes he has a parrot
he doesn't like it when people kiss in front of him
he's 12 years old 
he confuses left and right :/

This is a 2019 machine that was bought refurbished from Jura in early 2020, so it's about 5 years old. It's cleaned and descaled regularly, but has never been sent in for (or needed) any kind of maintenance from Jura.

The only clue we've been able to glean is that the pucks in the bin are smaller than normal, very wet, and falling apart. This suggests to me that not enough beans are getting into the brewing unit--but I can't tell whether the problem is between the hopper and the grinder or the grinder and the brewer.

We have separately ground beans and made a cup by sending those pre-ground beans down the chute in the back, and that seemed to work normally. This would seem to confirm that the problem is not in the brewing unit itself.

Are there any diagnostic steps I'm missing that might give us more clues? 

Can anyone suggest any steps I might take to correct this problem?",1,1735489076.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

Hello, interstellar navigators and ambitious spacefarers of the NIM galaxy! 🪐 It's the tail end of 2024, and as we prepare to warp into a brand-new year, let’s dive into how the Nordman Industries Manufacturing Inc. (NIM) continues to conquer Star Citizen’s cosmos without breaking a sweat—because here at NIM, we do know how to run a tight starship, if we may say so ourselves.

**NIM - Where Stars Align and Moons Shine Bright**

First order of cosmic business – while you might be twiddling with ship upgrades or debating the aerodynamic merits of the latest Hull series, at NIM, we're continuously strategizing operations that make even the brightest star’s kernel quake with envy. 🚀 Our community is more than just a gathering of ship enthusiasts; it's a dynamic orchestra where each player is an essential note, creating harmonious gameplay that not only achieves results but resonance across the universe.

**Join Us for a Galactic Lounge and Strategize**

Here’s where the magic really happens: the NIM Discord. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill chatroom; imagine, instead, a virtual galactic lounge where strategy is discussed as eagerly as the best brew of space coffee this side of Terra. Here, you’ll meet Commanders who speak fluent Vanduul and Chief Engineers who can fix your quantum drive with one hand tied behind their back – yes, it's that impressive! 💡 So, whether you're a greenhorn just trying to find your warp drive or an old-timer whose call sign is whispered in hushed tones across jump points, there’s a place for you at our digital roundtable.

**Although, What's News?**

Alas, we couldn’t bring you the very latest cosmic gossip slipping through newsfeeds today, but fret not! This is a galaxy that never sleeps, and you better believe our scanners are always set to inbox alert! 🤖 In the meantime, keep those Wander class repairs up and ready because who knows what next launch will catch our attention next? Hint: It won’t be another HoloVids novel but something far spacier and more thrilling.

**Nordman Industries: Beyond Just Manufacturing**

Why stop at inter-galactic travels when you can indulge in a culture rich in camaraderie and craft here at NIM? The backbone of Nordman Industries is its people—our fearless pilots, visionary strategists, and daring explorers. So while Nordman Industries Manufacturing might sound like it’s all about hull parts and refineries (and yes, it kind of is), our heart is in the friendships we build whilst navigating complex galaxies and rival organizations, always ensuring the payload lands right where it should.

**A Vision of Star Citizen Like No Other**

Being a part of NIM means engaging in unique strategies unheard of in the Star Citizen universe. For example, have you ever tried negotiating with a bounty hunter using only your ship’s sound system and a playlist of classic Earth ballads? No? Well, you’re missing out on one heck of a discussion point in the Pilots’ Lounge! 😄

So, ready to make this New Year larger-than-life and brighter-than-the-starlit-nights? Here at NIM, your story doesn’t just start; it soars.

Here I was a normal day looks like for us. 

I wake up around 5:30 to shower and get ready for work. Husband stays in bed. One kid gets up and I get them snack and whatever once the second kid wakes up (usually around 7/7:30) I go in and wake my husband up to ask for help.
He gets up and grabs a cup of coffee and sits down to finish a show or read an article on his phone.
I get kids dressed and fed while he showers
It’s usually by 8/8:30 and one of us takes the kids to daycare. 
We do our separate ways to work. Usually check in with each other via text and a call throughout the day. 
One of us gets the kids from school, he usually makes dinner and eats in the living room and I eat in the kitchen and feed the kids. 
I usually give the kids a bath and get them ready for bed while he watches tv. 
I put the baby to bed while he hangs with our older. When I done with baby I put the older to bed he says good night and then usually is in bed before I and done putting the older to bed. 
Once both kids are in bed I usually feed and water the dog, do the dishes and wipe down the counter. 

I feel like I am doing a hell of a lot. When I ask him to do something he says things like “I’ve done this all day” or “you are so demanding I don’t need your comments”. ",4,1735489053.0,Marriage,8,1.0,False
