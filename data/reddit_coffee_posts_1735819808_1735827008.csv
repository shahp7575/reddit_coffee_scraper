So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 22/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.  
  
Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.  
  
Hobbies of mine include:  
Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I play tons of genres though. 50+ hours into Marvel Rivals, and just started Enshrouded last night.  
  
Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. The Smile series wasn't half bad, either.  
  
Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. On a big 80's rock and hair metal band kick lately. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.  
  
Also a big (American) football fan (RIP my poor Niners), if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

1hru4el,https://i.redd.it/rex18x1i5lae1.png,Idea for a casual coffee date,"Today, I am here with an idea for what to wear when casually hanging out. I wore this for a casual coffee date on a Sunday.

The mix of khaki and blue makes it easy on the eyes. Therefore it is a great color combination for more casual looks. It also works on basically anyone!

I am wearing a classic double breasted trenchcoat on top. Right underneath it a very casual, completely unstructured flannel safari jacket. I combine that with a knit polo and a blue patternd scarf on top, and casual blue jeans as my bottoms. The shoes are black bluechers that I wear with basically anything, when in doubt.

So far I've been using it with nespresso beans (taking out the content of the nespresso to the portafilter), blasphemy I know, but at least it was properly extracted. Few days ago I went to a nice coffee shop in Austria and bought their beans and since I dont have a grinder yet, I asked them to grind it for espresso for me. However, it doesnt work well in my Bambino, I think its overextracted (shots took too long to come out, black in color and very little in volume).

Questions:

1. Does different coffee machine require different fineness? Cause what I've bought is the same beans and was grinded with the same fineness as the coffee they sell. I guess the answer is yes.

1hrtyai,https://i.redd.it/qy58q6yy3lae1.jpeg,"How I (M31) went into 2024 versus how I’m leaving it... During my wife’s pregnancy, I gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy,’ they’ve ever seen.","I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

I got sent to Blackrock Power station, despite never having been to Blackrock, with no food, all broken clothes, and half health. Isn't this region notorious for being a shitty place with predators everywhere or something? When the game says ""SAFE AND FAR"" I was thinking within Mystery Lake spawning at Alan's Cave or the Fishing huts from Clearcut. Not fucking Blackrock with no weapons. WTF is this? Is this a bug? I'm only on Voyager btw so this is some bullshit. They should only be spawning us ""FAR"" into adjacent maps like Mystery Lake into Forlorn Muskeg or something.

Let's say from a lore perspective, the survivor lost all condition and fell unconscious and some off screen other survivor looted my inventory and dumped me somewhere else (thats why we don't get all our gear back). Dumping me all the way in Blackrock is absurd. Basically from now on, NEVER pick ""safe and far"".

I'm basically going to die AGAIN simply because of this spawn. I exited power plant just now and immediately saw a wolf not far off and not enough terrain to walk around it. And I saw the wiki noting you cant walk on the ice/river, and there was no food in the ""safe"" powerplant. This is some bullshit.

OK, there was one coffee but no other food.

 I have been in a relationship for 2 years in March. It has been rocky, to say the least. I will list the positives first, then I will list the negatives. Part of me thinks this relationship is abusive, while another part of me tells me I am overreacting. I will describe the relationship honestly and let you all be the judge.
 I'll start off by saying that our connection is undeniable. From the moment we met, it was so clear that we had so much in common and were so similar. It really felt like love at first sight. We are 4 years apart in age, he is older. Immediately, I felt so safe around him. I could feel how protective he was of me. Always extremely accepting, encouraging. So funny, we would laugh for hours and hours. He is always willing to help me with anything and will always listen and comfort me. When I put my dog down, I laid with my head on his lap and he just sat there and rubbed my head while I wept for literally hours. It's in these moments that I feel I am truly in love with this man.
This post is getting so lengthy so if you have stayed with me this long, thank you, lol.
As time went on, I continued to fall in love but we kept having ""incidents"" or ""bad days"". Let me mention as well, my bf (34m) I am (30f). My bf has a TBI, when he was 11 years old he was run over by a car. He was in a medically induced coma for a week and when he woke up, he couldn't walk or talk. It took him a year to learn to walk and talk again. He has some very minor memory retention issues and he has trouble processing large amounts of information at once. Other than that, he is highly functional and ""normal"". What the accident left him with the most is emotional regulation problems. He has a bad temper and very bad paranoia. He is also highly impulsive. The first glimpse of issues was when I caught him smoking crack with some girl in a bad neighborhood near where we live. It was a whole fiasco and I had to help his mom locate him. His parents have legal guardianship over him so they are in control of his time, money, everything. I eventually forgave him for that incident, but after that it was like I was catching him talking to girls online almost monthly. It was absolutely exhausting and hurtful. He also started to become violent and overly jealous. If we were on the highway and a guy drove past us, he would accuse me of looking at the guy, or knowing him. Everywhere we went in public, he would constantly accuse me of checking guys out or flirting with cashiers, which I never did. I'm super awkward and shy when it comes to flirting, I couldn't even do that if I wanted to. He continued to get more and more angry. He has threatened to beat up until I can't breathe, he has threatened to murder me. He would often tell me that he was going to hunt me down and find me. He told me if he sees me in public he will attack me. He has chased me through parking lots with his car, and he has spit in my face. There have been many times where I had to escape when he has been mad and I genuinely felt like I was escaping for my life. Last winter he hurt me the most. He went behind my back to go smoke crack with a girl he met on fb and then they were going to have sex. One thing lead to another and he ended up stealing her money and she stole his phone. She ended up going through his phone, seeing I'm his gf, and contacting me as a form if revenge against him for stealing her money. She told me everything they were supposed to do that night. She also sent me screenshots of all the girls he had been talking to and meeting up with. There was one girl he was meeting with for coffee regularly behind my back, even telling her he loved her. This incident absolutely broke me, but I still stayed with him. This was last year. Where we are at now, we are together but our relationship is strained. I have 0 trust in him and since he has such a guilty conscious, he CONSTANTLY accuses me of cheating. I mean this is an everyday thing. If I don't answer his calls or texts right away while I'm at work, he starys accusing me of cheating and threatens to go off with someone else. We can't even go out and do anything because if there are people around, he thinks I'm looking at them and ""checking them out"". Part of me wants to leave him but a larger part of me just can't. Depsite all he has done, I genuinely love him so much and feel extremely attached to him.
 Now, back to present, where I am preparing to finally move out of my parents home. So, I know how it can look me being 30 years old and living with my parents still. But it's not as bad as it seems. Yes I technically ""live"" here but there hasn't been much ""living"" here on my part. For 15 years, I have pretty much inly slept here. I wake up before my parents, leave the house, and I don't return until after dark. There's no relaxing done here. There's no recharging. It's where I sleep and keep my stuff. I can't cook here, I can't do my laundry here, sometimes I can't even shower. I eat out mostly, if I need down time I get hotel rooms, and I typically shower at plant fitness, and do my laundry at the laundromat. I am somewhere between housed and homeless. Like a purgatory of some sort. My father has been a mean drunk my whole life. He drinks everyday, I have never seen him sober for more then 24 hours. My mom is so beaten down from dealing with an addicted partner for so many years that she has completely emotionally checked out and become narcissistic and selfish because she has neglected herself for so many years, that now her brain can only focus in itself. Both my parents and emotionally abusive and put me down regularly. Sometimes if I make too much noise in the night getting a glass of water, and I'm screamed and cursed at, and called horrible names. My dog was another big reason I stayed. They wouldn't let me take him, and I didn't have the heart to ditch him and leave him neglected by them. But now that my dog is gone, and my parents are selling our house and moving to Missouri, it's time for me to make decisions. As I mentioned earlier, I tried to find places in Jersey but it's all too expensive. I have been to Nashville, TN and I absolutely loved it. I've wanted to move there for a while. I have enough money, access to a job out there, and my car can make it. I forgot to mention as well, that I am a singer songwriter and music is a very large part of my life. If I go, I will have to go in 6 months in June. I told my boyfriend the news a week ago and since I told him, he is nonstop crying. Unconsolable. Telling me he can't live without me. I feel so incredibly guilty. I dont want to leave him and I feel insecure and u safe without him being in my life. I feel like so much has been stripped from my life and I just feel....weird. out of place, empty.
He's making me want to stay, but part of me knows if I stay I'm going to just deal.with more of his abuse. The good times are amazing,but the bad times are hard and becoming more and more frequent. He has no money, no job, no car either. So it's not like he can even help me if I stay here. I keep wanting things to go back to ""normal"" but I quickly realize my ""normal"" is gone. It's not coming back even if I wanted it to.
So now I don't know what to do. Should I go through with moving to Nashville? Starting new. Breaking away from all the abuse I've been surrounded by for the last 30 years. Or do I stay? Stay with my boyfriend. What would u do?

This is all a lot for me. I'm looking for other perspectives and honest advice. If what u want to say is harsh, but true, I can take it. But if you're going to leave me comments shaming me for my life decisions and where I am at in my life, please don't. I realize where I'm at is partially caused by my own decisions and choices. But, im trying to be better and make a functional life for myself. Be kind. ",2,1735825127.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1hrts9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hrts9i/my_f33_exfiancé_m29_broke_off_our_relationship_in/,My (F33) ex-fiancé (M29) broke off our relationship in July. He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.,"My (F33) ex-fiancé (M29) broke off our relationship in July. He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.

Back story - my ex fiancé was friends with my brother for 11 years, since he (ex) was 18 and friends with sister in law (my brothers wife) for 7 years give or take. They were in a band together and spent a lot of time together as a band and with their group of friends 

Ex and I started dating March 2022 and I moved in with him about a year later, he proposed December 2023. He was my best friend and I trusted him more than any person in my life. It just seemed so natural and comforting. I know we were in love and he cared about me a lot. We never fought or raised our voices at each other…

We got in an argument on the way home from our Fourth of July trip, which took up pretty much the whole day because we stopped to look at 2 wedding venues on the way home. That night when we got home we had an argument, he went for a walk and when he came back I told him I’m here to talk when he’s ready, and laid in bed. He didnt talk to me and I woke up crying at 5 am.. he asked if I wanted to talk or be comforted and I said I wanted to talk. I asked him if he thought we got engaged too soon and he said yes, then I asked him how we can move forward and work on things and he said “I don’t think we can” and that was that. He was extremely adamant about not making it work and going our separate ways. I tried and tried to get him to change his mind but he was sure about not wanting to be with me. Mind you, we talked the whole weekend with his parents about the wedding plans, looked at venues on the way home and even discussed our bridal party the weekend before at a coffee shop we used to go to saying we wanted to bring our wedding party there to tell them.  We also took engagement pictures 3 weeks before breaking up.. i had NO idea that he was feeling this way. He later (after breaking up) expressed that he felt like he couldn’t come to me about issues because I can be “defensive” and he didn’t feel I was a “safe space for him” I never knew he felt like that. He brought up other things like I was on my phone too much (I was planning our wedding) and our sex life wasn’t as much as he wanted, he said we were incompatible and wanted a relationship like his brother & sister in law (I still don’t know what he meant by that) because in my eyes we were best friends. He also said we didn’t communicate well.. We were so happy and (I thought) respectful of each other but he basically blamed me for everything.. I really just had no idea he felt this  way, he said he had built up resentment and regret because of all of it. 

My brother and sister in law don’t speak to him anymore and he doesn’t hang out with their friend group and band mates anymore either. They all lost so much respect for him and he essentially isolated himself away from his friends too. These are friends we would see frequently and some friends he knew since high school. 

Come to find out about 4 months after we broke up, he started dating his coworker. I had a suspicion of this coworker (F25) even though I trust my ex at the time. He actually introduced me to her and she has come to his band’s shows twice throughout the year. He also spent work trips with her, & went to one of her parties while I was out of town.. But again I met her and have had conversations with her, and didn’t think much of it. But their friendship started to make me feel uncomfortable and I expressed that to him. I told him I didn’t like him hanging out with her and he said his other coworkers were there everytime and “you don’t trust me?” I said I did trust him but it makes me uncomfortable and I’m setting a boundary. They’re both musicians and are on their company’s social media/creative team.. they post reels/videos on many different platforms playing music together and interviewing other musicians, etc. I think he had harbored feelings for her and saw things in her that he essentially liked better. I still can’t even think about dating or being in a serious relationship with someone new. 4 months after an engagement he’s dating his coworker!! 

My sister in law said this is a pattern of his to be a serial dater and has even left an ex for someone new in the past. He has always been in a relationship and I think 4 months of us not being together might be the longest he’s ever been without a girlfriend. I thought I could trust him because he was so close with my family and friends. I really thought I would spend my life with him. 

Writing this all out makes me realize that it’s a him problem and although I have things I need to work on, this is just who he is as a person. The beginning of the relationship was so sweet and intimate, he said I love you first (after 10 days of dating 🚩) but at the time I thought it was sweet, I told him I didn’t feel the same way but I still cared for him a lot and I know I will eventually feel the same. 

I just feel so terrible about myself and feel like I could have done things differently to avoid us breaking up. It hurts so much still. I am slowly feeling better but it affected me a lot and I don’t see myself being in a serious relationship for a long time. I am beside myself that he is with this coworker now.

The 078 mutes acidity much more than the K-Ultra and excels at producing a silkier, sweeter and juicier brew with noticeable body depending on how fine you go. It’s also a bit better at producing tasting notes than the K-Ultra. The K-Ultra is kind of a jack of all trades and excels at being pretty great (but not amazing) at everything. It has generally more acidity up front than the 078 which I enjoy from time to time. All around enjoyable coffee from the K-Ultra.

Would love to hear thoughts from owners of a ZP6, Pietro Pro, or other similar grinders. Would a ZP6 be too much like the K-Ultra? I’m maybe more interested in the Pietro Pro, but I recently saw a Hoon’s Coffee video where he described it as kind of bland (he used the analogy of an unseasoned steak dinner— great meat flavor without the added extra spices), which I thought was an odd description.

1hrtqx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbusGA/comments/1hrtqx1/rcolumbusga_guide_to_columbus_for_those_moving/,"/r/ColumbusGA Guide to Columbus for those moving here, visiting here, or already here","*Greetings, from the Fountain City! Columbus is a mid-sized city on the Chattahoochee River. Below you’ll find a guide to the area, everything from where to live, where to eat, and what to do.*  
  
#**Where to live**  
  
*The Columbus area offers something for everyone, from urban walkability to horse farms, from historic shaded neighborhoods to gated luxury apartments, and all for a pretty decent price. Where to start looking? Find Wynnton Road on a map, follow it east until it turns into Macon Road and keep following it E-NE until you get to US-80. You probably want to keep your search to the north of these roads. Neighborhoods to the north tend to be safer than to the south, where high poverty rates bring crime issues related to gang activity, but that is not an absolute rule.*  
  
**Columbus can be divided into 6 general areas;**  
  
**Downtown** - People from Columbus will generally call this Downtown while those who live there or who are not native will probably call it **Uptown**. Regardless of what you call it, this is the historic heart of the city, where historic homes and renovated lofts rub elbows with a large number of businesses, local bars, restaurants, recreational areas, event venues, the downtown portion of Columbus State University, and the mass majority of the city's government. If you want an urban feel with high walkability, look here first.  
  
**Midtown** - At the center of Midtown is Weracoba Park, surrounded by early 20th c. homes, it is made up of over 20 neighborhoods, some full of stately mansions, others somewhat dilapidated cottages, and lots of nice homes in between. Plenty of leafy parks and several commercial areas. Here you'll find the Columbus Museum, Aflac's Headquarters, and the Columbus Country Club.  
  
**North Columbus** - The Northside can be divided into two parts. The southern half which is a mix of commercial, industrial, and middle-class residential. It was mostly built out between the 1950s-1980s. And then there is the northern half which is somewhat newer, more suburban, and has more upper-middle-class neighborhoods and apartment complexes. A good rule of thumb is that this area is just around and north of US-80. Here you'll find Columbus Park Crossing (locally known as the ""Strip Mall"") as well as most of the entertainment venues that are not located in Downtown.  
  
**Midland** and **Upatoi** - Sometimes called the Panhandle, this is the far eastern section of the city and until recently was pretty rural, it is mostly large lot subdivisions. The area is rapidly growing and anchored by new commercial development around the US-80/Manchester Expressway intersection.  
  
**East Columbus** - This diverse area includes Columbus State University’s main campus and plenty of middle-class neighborhoods. Keep in mind the Macon Road Rule when looking at houses here, it's not immediate, for example Willow Bend and the neighborhoods along Woodruff Farm Road and Forrest Roads are fine. The eastern part tends to be a bit more chill than the part to the southwest.  
*Whisperwood Apartments Caveat - they are north of Macon Road, but it’s got a very bad rep on this sub. Avoid unless you get a first and last months free rent deal on a two month lease, and even then consider your other options.*  
  
**South Columbus** - There are some decent working and middle class neighborhoods here. There are also the most dangerous streets in the city here. If you pay attention to local news, you will start to know certain streets by name. If you are restricted by budget and security minded, you could find a great deal in this part of town, but try and see the neighborhood in person before committing.  
  
**Elsewhere in the Chattahoochee Valley**  
  
To the north is **Harris County**, which has experienced a lot of growth over the last 25 years from people looking for a more rural option than North Columbus provides as well as those looking to escape Columbus in general. In doing so they’ve helped create a pretty large bedroom community that isn’t very rural anymore. You'll also find it difficult to find lots less than 2 acres due to local residential ordinances. New development is beginning in earnest nearer to the I-185 exits throughout the county. Here you will find towns such as Ellerslie, Cataula, Hamilton, Waverly Hall, and Pine Mountain. The most well known entity in Harris County is Callaway Gardens located in Pine Mountain.    
  
Across the river is **Phenix City, AL**. It mirrors Columbus in a lot of ways. There are rundown, low-income neighborhoods to the south, older middle-class neighborhoods to the north, and new subdivision growth outside of the city into formerly rural **Smiths Station** and **Ladonia**. Phenix City, **Russell County, AL**, and as well as much of southern **Lee County, AL** are on Eastern Time despite being located in Central Time. This primarily changes about halfway to **Auburn/Opelika**. We highly suggest you check an unfamiliar business’ hours of operation if outside of Smiths Station to be sure of their hours of operation.  
  
**Fort Moore** is to the direct south and actually occupies 40% of Muscogee County. All that banging you hear at all hours of the day and night? That’s probably Fort Moore. You’ll find many in Columbus struggle with the name of this military base as it was recently renamed from **Fort Benning** several years ago and that name is codified in many Columbusite’s lexacons. If you are in the military, this is where you are working or likely staying. If you are a civilian, you’ll likely spend very little time here. Regardless, you’ll need to check in at the main gate for any business done there without a military ID. The annual July 4th celebration at Fort Moore is open to all and is generally a good time.  
  
**Chattahoochee County** and **Fort Mitchell, AL** are to the south. Rural subdivisions which mostly cater to military families who want convenience getting to Fort Moore and want to completely avoid the moderate amount of traffic issues Columbus has.  
  
**Marion County** and **Talbot County** are to the east and if you are looking for land but still need to get to Columbus, then the western parts of these two counties could be just right for you. Be forewarned: This area is extremely rural with very poor access to emergency services such as fire departments, ambulances, and law enforcement.  
  
**Got kids, thinking about schools?**  
  
Muscogee County School District has a handful of the best schools in the state. Columbus High and Britt David Elementary are routinely top 3 public schools in Georgia. But, they are magnet schools, meaning admittance is highly competitive.  
Most of the other schools are more average and below-average, but rankings like that can be superficial. Most every school has magnet programs and honors classes where students with a desire for a quality education are provided for.  
A school like Wynnton Elementary scores below average, but it's magnet arts program has students in some of the most creative learning environments available in the state and the students in the program have test scores much higher than the rest of the school.  
Schools each have themed magnet programs, ranging from STEM to IB to Mass Communication to Fine Arts, there’s something for every interest.  
What this also means is that a parent does not have to worry as much about where their house is located in the city, because getting their student into almost any school is relatively easy.  
  
Outside of public schools, Columbus has a few religious private schools and a secular prep school, Brookstone.  
  
**Want more info?**  
We highly suggest that you use the search option to find the latest. r/ColumbusGA regularly entertains questions about specific neighborhoods/apartments and all sorts of other questions. It is highly likely that your question has been answered.  
  
#**Where to eat and drink**  
Don’t let anyone tell you that there’s nowhere good to eat here or that it’s all national chains. Yes, there are a bunch of chains, especially in North Columbus, and they cater to nearly every taste. We all know about them and what to expect from them, so you won’t find those in the following lists. These lists were made by polling of over 100 members of r/ColumbusGA. We appreciate their assistance in helping create this.    
*This list is not meant to be comprehensive. It is this subreddit’s collective “Best Of” rankings for each category. Most categories are a top 5 or top 10. There are hidden gems all over the city and we encourage people to post new restaurants and reviews.*

#**What to do**  
There’s a lot going on in the Chattahoochee Valley, but finding out about it can sometimes be difficult. Here are a few places to check in with to see what’s coming.  
  
[Visit Columbus Events](https://visitcolumbusga.com/events/) - up to date with area events  
  
[The Local Magazine](https://thelocalcolumbus.com/) - look for free copies around area restaurants and stores  
  
[Electric City Life](https://electriccitylife.com/category/events/) - Better presence on social media but their events page tends to help a little when looking for local happenings.  
  
[The Columbusite](https://www.thecolumbusite.net/) - It doesn't have a monthly calendar, but they keep up to date about upcoming events and goings-on around town and highlight them frequently.  
  
[Uptown Columbus](http://uptowncolumbusga.com/events/events/events.aspx) - there’s always things happening Downtown, every summer there are free outdoor concerts every Friday night  
  
**Museums, Arts, and Culture**  
  
* [National Infantry Museum](https://nationalinfantrymuseum.org/) - one of the best military museums in the country and admittance is free (donations always appreciated)  
* [The U.S. Army Armor & Cavalry Collection](https://www.armorcavalryheritagefoundation.org/) - a very large collection of over 100 pieces of armor from World War 1 to today’s battlefield all located on Fort Moore. It’s free to visit but open houses are only a few times a year so check the calendar. Donations are also welcome.  
* [Columbus Museum](https://www.columbusmuseum.com/) - recently renovated with a great mix of the area’s natural and human history along with a large arts collection, and it’s all free (donations always appreciated)  
* [Bo Bartlett Center](https://bobartlettcenter.org/) - CSU’s showroom, where the public is free to view a steady rotation of art produced by student, regional, and nationally acclaimed talent  
* [Pasaquan](https://pasaquan.columbusstate.edu/) (Buena Vista, GA) - a unique outdoor folk art piece took over and transformed an old farm, must see in person  
* [Museum of Wonder](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-wonder-seale-alabama) (Seale, AL) - weird, wonderful, wacky, weird, are just some of the thoughts you’ll have when you drive through the Museum of Wonder, it’s unlike anything else on Earth, stop in and venture into the artist’s shop, if you dare  
* [Columbus Library](https://www.cvlga.org/columbus-public-library/) - the main branch is great, it has most any magazine you can think of, a world class childrens’ wing, and an impressive local history/genealogical room  
* [Springer Opera House](https://www.springeroperahouse.org/) - Georgia’s state opera house, a great place to see a play or other performance during its year long seasons, laugh and/or cringe at the weekly free No-Shame Theater, get scared on the ghost tour, or send your kids to Childrens’ Theater  
* [Rivercenter](https://rivercenter.org/) - home to the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, Youth Orchestra of Greater Columbus, and the Columbus Ballet, as well as the a premier facility for any type of show to see on stage. Tickets to these shows are a real big city amenity offered at very attainable prices  
* [National Civil War Naval Museum](https://www.portcolumbus.org/) - The only museum in the country that focuses on both the Union and Confederate navies of the American Civil War. You can spend hours looking at all the flags, artwork, set pieces, and the remaining pieces of the CSS Jackson wreck that are on display. Yearly events include haunted tours in October and the annual RiverBlast celebration held in March where reenactments are held and the enormous cannons are fired.  
* [Andersonville National Historic Site](https://www.nps.gov/ande/index.htm) (Americus, GA) - The largest nearby American Civil War site. Here you will find the site of the largest and deadliest POW camp in the Confederacy. It also shares residence with the National Prisoner of War Museum and the Andersonville National Cemetery containing many POW and veteran grave sites. Definitely a hidden reminder of war in our own backyard.

* Dragonfly Trail - Columbus’ network of over 34 miles of multi-use trails, there are another 27 miles planned, completed highlights are the Riverwalk and the Fall Line Trace

1hrtqtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hrtqtt/back_in_the_dating_scene_after_14_years/,Back in the dating scene after 14 years,"I got out of a 11-12 year relationship about two years ago (wasn’t my choice), in that time I focused and worked on myself but never tried to get back into dating or trying to find someone new (I really didn’t want to and wasn’t ready).

I have recently met a guy on a dating app (I know never thought I would be that person) and we had a few dates, met for coffee, had a few lunches, had a few walks, played mini golf. Problem is on the last date he kissed me and was a bit too touchy and feely. I got overwhelmed and told him the next day I thought it was too soon and rushed.

I enjoyed having someone to talk to and hang out with, but I feel guys are too quick to be wanting to kiss you and want to be all over you. I get overwhelmed and feel smothered, but I also think I’m the type of person who needs to have an emotional connection and like someone enough to want to touch them or let them touch me.

It’s been quite a long time since I dated, but I never really knew the social etiquette (felt things were simpler at my age back then). Can anyone give me advice, I am looking for something long term but compatibility and sharing the same values are important to me. I am ideally looking for my forever person, is there anything I should look out for? I thought my last relationship was my forever person but I was proved wrong. 

Appreciate also hearing guys perspectives as it would be great to hear that you think or defines a guy that is genuine and wanting the same thing as I do. What are clear signs or actions? Green flags vs Red flags etc.

Hi guys!

My girlfriend wants to buy a nice coffee machine. She likes a good coffee, so she decided to buy in into this world an have awesome coffees at home. We mainly drink cappuchinos so the milk steamer should be as good as possible in the machine.

We found 2 options in our price range. The first one is the Sage barista  express or express impress. These two are combined machines with a grinder. 
The other option is a Sage bambino plus with a separate grinder with a sage BCG600BTR.

Please help us decide what to buy, we are new to the home brew coffee world :D Or if you could recommend some other machine or setup in this price range we welcome that as well. As i said in the begining, our man goal is to make the best cappucinos possible :D

It is with great care and respect that I wish to discuss the question, ""Would God ask us to harm others?""

[I discuss this topic over a cup of coffee this morning if you prefer to engage that way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o6fq5fHH9o)

Here is my primary concern:

Yesterday, a truck plowed through a crowd of people in New Orleans, Louisiana. And from what I understand, the attacker believed he was acting out the will of God.

Lets all take a moment of silence for the loved one of those who have died and those who are injured. How terrible it must be to be in their shoes.

.....

I believe that when events like this happen, it is a good time to reflect on our own personal beliefs and how they impact the world around us.

So, today I am going to draw a parallel between the New Orleans Truck Incident, and the Biblical Slaughter of the Canaanites.

The two events do share some similarities.

Both the New Orleans Attacker, and the Israelites believed they were acting out the will of God. Please, take a few brief moments to reflect on that reality.

We know, and we must openly admit, that Christianity is not immune to such behavior. But I think it goes a layer deeper than that.

Not only is Christianity not immune from the behavior, but the Christian also must defend such behavior.

What do I mean when I say, ""The Christian""?

I am not speaking for all Christians, because most Christians do not have what I would consider to be an active faith. Faith which truly impacts and changes the behavior of your life. Faith that would make you completely unlike me, in my sinful, unsaved state.

So when I say, ""The Christian"" I am speaking of the type of Christian who's faith actually impacts their life. Those who go deep and have examined their beliefs and can give an account of why they believe what they believe.

I am speaking of the Christians who are equipped and prepared to carry out the art of apologetics.

These individuals, at some point, will come across the issue I am addressing here. And in that moment when we come across this issue, we can do a few things.

Ill tell you what I did, I avoided it. I didn't think too heavily on such things. Because doing so created a sense of discomfort within me.

But there is another option. You can defend and justify the actions of the Israelites. And it is all to easy to do.

[Alex 'O Connor does an amazing interview with William Lane Craig on this issue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjsSHd23e0Q)

All in all, here is my main point: Christianity is not immune from the behavior we saw play out in New Orleans.

And I think in moments like this, we should all be aware of that reality.",5,1735824053.0,DebateReligion,6,0.73,False

1hrtdg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheUmmahCafe/comments/1hrtdg9/the_best_guide_to_preparation_for_ramadan/,The Best Guide to Preparation for Ramadan,"Ramadan is a sacred month for Muslims, a time for spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and an opportunity to get [closer to Allah](https://pinkpastelstudios.com/7-ways-to-become-allahs-beloved-servant/). Preparing adequately for Ramadan ensures you can maximize the spiritual, mental, and physical benefits. This guide provides detailed, actionable steps to help your optimal preparation for Ramadan.

# Why Preparing for Ramadan is Essential

Ramadan is not just about fasting or not eating anything from dawn to sunset. It is a comprehensive journey of worship, self-improvement, and community service. Without proper preparation, you might miss out on its immense benefits. Preparing in advance allows you to:

* Enter Ramadan with a focused and clear mindset.
* Make the most of the limited days and nights.
* Avoid unnecessary distractions and fatigue.
* Strengthen your connection with Allah (SWT).
* Enhance your physical and mental resilience for fasting.

# Spiritual Preparation for Ramadan

The first step is to prepare yourself spiritually. Following things can help you get prepared:

1. **Strengthen Your Relationship with the Qur’an**

* **Start Reciting Daily**: Begin a daily Qur’an recitation habit before Ramadan starts. Even if it’s just a page or two; building consistency is the key.
* **Reflect on Tafsir**: Read the meanings and Tafsir (explanation) of the Qur’an to deepen your understanding. Utilize resources like *Tafsir Ibn Kathir* or online platforms offering authentic interpretations.
* **Set Goals**: Plan how much of the Qur’an you aim to complete during Ramadan — e.g., finishing one Juz’ (chapter) per day. Break this into manageable daily targets.
* **Actionable Step**: Download a Qur’an app, such as Quran.com, or purchase a translation with Tafsir to read after each prayer.

2. **Repentance and Forgiveness**

* **Seek Allah’s Mercy**: Engage in sincere Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) to [cleanse your heart and soul](https://pinkpastelstudios.com/top-10-sins-muslims-overlook-in-their-daily-lives/). Recite phrases such as *Astaghfirullah* (I seek forgiveness from Allah) regularly.
* **Reconcile with Others**: Reach out to family and friends to mend relationships and seek their forgiveness. Doing so removes barriers to blessings in Ramadan.
* **Actionable Step**: Dedicate 15 minutes daily for Dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Incorporate [Morning, Evening and Adhkars](https://pinkpastelstudios.com/how-to-incorporate-morning-evening-adhkars-in-your-life/) after Salah in your life.

3. **Establish Tahajjud and Other Voluntary Prayers**

* **Night Prayers**: Start praying Tahajjud (late-night prayer) to prepare for the longer Tarawih prayers during Ramadan.
* **Rawatib Sunnah**: Perform the Sunnah prayers before and after obligatory prayers consistently. These bring immense reward and spiritual elevation.
* **Actionable Step**: Set an alarm 20 minutes before Fajr to pray at least two Rak’ahs of Tahajjud, making Du’a afterward.

4. **Increase Your Du’a (Supplications)**

* **Create a Du’a List**: Write down personal and specific supplications for Ramadan. Include prayers for guidance, forgiveness, and success in both worlds.
* **Focus on Acceptance Times**: Practice making Du’a during the last third of the night, before breaking your fast, and between the Adhan and Iqamah.
* **Actionable Step**: Use a Du’a journal to list and track your prayers and their fulfillment.

# Mental Preparation for Ramadan

Next step is to prepare yourself mentally. Here are a few things which you can do:

1. **Set Clear Intentions (Niyyah)**

* Make a firm intention to fast sincerely for the sake of Allah and to seek His pleasure. Revisit and renew your intentions regularly throughout the month.
* **Actionable Step**: Write your intentions and review them daily as a form of self-accountability.

2. **Educate Yourself About Ramadan**

* **Review Fiqh (Islamic Rulings)**: Understand the rules of fasting, such as what nullifies the fast, exemptions, and the importance of Suhoor.
* **Listen to Lectures**: Attend local or online Islamic lectures about Ramadan to boost your knowledge. Scholars like Mufti Menk and Omar Suleiman provide excellent resources.
* **Actionable Step**: Watch one Ramadan-focused lecture weekly leading up to the month and take notes for practical application.

**3. Plan Your Schedule**

* **Prioritize Worship**: Allocate specific times for Qur’an recitation, prayers, Dhikr, and charitable activities. Organize your day to avoid time wastage.
* **Avoid Burnout**: Plan for adequate rest to sustain energy for nighttime prayers and early Suhoor meals.
* **Actionable Step**: Use a planner or app like Google Calendar to block time for Ramadan activities, ensuring balance between worship, work, and rest.

# Physical Preparation for Ramadan

Next step is to prepare your body for Ramadan. Here are a few things you can do:

1. **Adjust Your Sleep Schedule**

* Gradually shift your sleeping patterns to wake up earlier for Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) and Tahajjud. This will make the transition smoother when Ramadan begins.
* **Actionable Step**: Start sleeping 15–30 minutes earlier each week before Ramadan and waking up earlier by the same increment.

2. **Begin Fasting Voluntarily**

* Fast on Mondays and Thursdays or the 13th, 14th, and 15th of Sha’ban (the Islamic month before Ramadan) to get accustomed to fasting. This aligns with the Sunnah and strengthens your resolve.
* **Actionable Step**: Set reminders for these Sunnah fasting days and prepare simple Suhoor meals.

3. **Prepare Your Body for Long Hours of Fasting**

* **Reduce Caffeine**: Gradually cut down on coffee or tea.
* **Hydrate Well**: Increase water intake to improve hydration levels. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses of water daily.
* **Actionable Step**: Carry a water bottle and set hourly reminders to drink water during non-fasting hours.

4. **Plan Your Meals**

* Prepare healthy and balanced meals for Suhoor and Iftar. Include slow-digesting foods like oats, dates, and lean proteins for sustained energy.
* Avoid sugary and processed foods that cause energy crashes.
* Actionable Step: Create a meal prep plan for the first week of Ramadan and stock up on healthy ingredients.

# Social and Community Preparation for Ramadan

Here are a few tips to prepare yourself for Social and Community aspects:

1. **Strengthen Family Bonds**

* Involve your family in Ramadan planning, such as setting Qur’an goals, organizing group Iftars, or planning charity initiatives.
* **Actionable Step**: Schedule weekly family meetings to discuss Ramadan goals and distribute responsibilities.

2. **Plan for Charity and Volunteering**

* **Zakat and Sadaqah**: Calculate your Zakat early and identify causes to support. Research reputable organizations working locally and globally.
* **Community Service**: Volunteer at your local mosque or charity organizations to help distribute meals or organize events.
* **Actionable Step**: Create a list of charities and allocate a budget for daily or weekly Sadaqah. Include your children to teach them about giving.

3. **Attend Pre-Ramadan Events**

* Participate in community lectures, halaqahs (study circles), and Ramadan bazaars to build a sense of togetherness.
* **Actionable Step**: Check your local mosque’s calendar and mark key events. Encourage friends to join you.
* You can checkout this [Ramadan Planner and Journal for Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Ramadan-Journal-Activity-Children/dp/B0CVHS4GLY/ref=sr_1_18?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P0A7op5sgxSiJLVgDhO45N-nJ9k_PPkyx3seXXGjwLFhmot3wz0ROFuPv5nLV9j5tNQU1q86mMuZTf76gx7qQpEpI1c8lK_dfQFUKYjJz9jOeVnH1ioIcz3L1CMe3P978S7We-gUreJL7rKrmHUnf6SerJm6kONOvUZbjZR_xVrEvA10PSOScs3eID5LGWW8as4UoYhQ2GSerFKBq59Yp7JYOiyD0lfpc3S-r_Ul7mE.U3gtVzix0ZzE3okUHdIm_9tQAEct-ApMRkIgWEHyodo&dib_tag=se&qid=1735822578&refinements=p_27%3AMadiha+Ali&s=books&sr=1-18&xpid=PVdZl9B0I5qwz), to help inculcate it’s spirit

# Practical Tips for a Smooth Ramadan

1. **De-clutter Your Home**

* Organize your space to create a peaceful environment for worship. Focus on de-cluttering areas like your prayer space, kitchen, and living room.
* **Actionable Step**: Dedicate one weekend to de-cluttering and setting up a Ramadan prayer corner with a prayer mat, Qur’an, and Tasbih (prayer beads).

2. **Set Technology Boundaries**

* Limit screen time and reduce distractions from social media. Use Ramadan as an opportunity to detox digitally.
* **Actionable Step**: Uninstall unnecessary apps or set usage limits on your devices using features like Screen Time.

3. **Prepare Eid Early**

* Plan for Eid clothing, gifts, and meals early to avoid last-minute stress during Ramadan. This allows you to focus fully on worship during the last 10 nights.
* Actionable Step: Create an Eid checklist and tackle tasks gradually, starting with gift ideas and shopping lists.

# Conclusion

Preparing for Ramadan is a multi-faceted process that involves spiritual, mental, and physical readiness. By following these actionable steps, you can enter Ramadan with focus and enthusiasm, ready to maximize the blessings of this holy month. Remember, preparation is an act of worship itself, as it reflects your intention to please Allah (SWT). Begin your preparations today, and make this Ramadan your best one yet, inshaAllah.

What’s worse is when the actual senior or PWD is sent to place the order while the rest of their group, who are perfectly healthy and capable, stay seated or stand nearby. (Talaga ba? Yung senior or PWD pa ang pina-order para makasingit?)

While we understand and respect the privilege, we always clarify that we can only prioritize the cardholder’s drink. The rest of the orders need to queue up like everyone else. Some people get mad, even shouting at us enforcing this policy.

","# DEC. 2ND, 2024~Beijing Calls Washington’s Bluff on Strategic Metals

China’s latest export restriction lays bare the complex geopolitics behind President Trump’s proposed tariffs—and the green energy transition.

[Beijing Calls Washington’s Bluff on Strategic Metals | The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/china-export-minerals-trump-tariffs/)

[Minerals displayed at the showroom of a battery recycling plant in Wuhan, China, in 2023.\(Qilai Shen \/ Bloomberg via Getty Images\)Earlier this December, t](https://preview.redd.it/puwrmqrknkae1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb92135d6ec694bd22d00b9786b64991d281c28b)

Earlier this December, the Chinese government announced that it would curb the export of several key industrial minerals, as well as certain types of graphite. The move came in the context of mounting pressure on China from Washington, and in anticipation of stringent tariffs that Donald J. Trump has promised to levy when he returns to the presidency next year.

Chinese government spokespeople [have argued](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202408/1318104.shtml) that curbing export of these minerals is in line with their government’s antiproliferation efforts. They have said that the materials are “dual use,” and that they might be used in manufacturing weapons. Officials in the United States have historically also argued the same thing about some of the minerals, such as graphite, which the US put under strict export controls in 2006.

Among the minerals are [antimony](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_a_critical_material_probably_never_heard_of.pdf) (which is used in night-vision goggles and bullets), [gallium](https://www.csis.org/analysis/de-risking-gallium-supply-chains-national-security-case-eroding-chinas-critical-mineral) (precision-guided weapons and radar systems), and [germanium](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3079217/dla-program-introduces-domestic-germanium-recycling-capability/) (powerful sensors that are mounted on tanks, ships and helicopters). Superhard metals like tungsten may also be included in the restrictions, as is graphite, a type of carbon familiar from its use in pencils. Certain types of [graphite](https://mwi-inc.com/blog-post/understanding-graphite-as-a-material-for-military-components/) are used in gun barrels, and [others](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224564/#:~:text=Military%20Applications,target%20troops%20in%20the%20field) are dispersed on the battlefield as a sort of smoke that confuses electromagnetic wave detection devices.

Most of these materials also have considerable civilian uses. For instance, graphite is used in the anodes, or negative electrodes, of almost all lithium-ion batteries. (If you’re reading this article on a battery-powered device, you’re probably using graphite in some form.) What export controls mean is that non-Chinese companies that use the material in products destined for the United States will have to apply for export licenses. Such licenses will be up to Chinese officials to grant or withhold.

China controls the vast majority of the processing of some of these materials—a fact that began to register widely in Washington only as tensions began to ramp up with China during the previous Trump administration. China, for instance, [produces](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-firms-race-secure-non-chinese-graphite-evs-shortages-loom-2023-06-21/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=Daily-Briefing&utm_term=062123) 61 percent of natural graphite and 98 percent of the world’s final processed graphite. Graphite is also a key material in the green energy transition and electric vehicles: Last year, some 50 percent of the world’s natural graphite went into electric vehicles.

Beijing has managed to extend its grip across the supply chain in recent years. Efforts have been made—most notably through Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—to create a supply chain for critical minerals that is independent of China, as well as the development of [new technology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.202405674) that reduces the need for hard-to-get materials. But progress has been slow. “China is still set to be the dominant player,” said Tony Alderson, the senior anode and cathode analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a specialist provider of supply chain and energy transition information. “I think the investment that they are putting in is huge, and it is more than the US with regard to the anode supply chain.” Despite paeans to progress from politicians in Europe and the US, 2024, he said, was “the year of delays,” and a widening gap between supply and demand for critical minerals in everywhere but China.

By banning the export of these minerals, the Chinese government is showing that it has leverage over critical parts of the supply chain for electronics. “We see it in the industry as a shot across the bow,” Michael R. Hollomon II, the commercial director at US Strategic Metals, a mining and processing firm focused on green transition materials, told me. He noted that the Chinese have enacted similar bans of critical minerals in the past, including a ban last year of specific gallium and germanium products. “The Chinese government have put their money where their mouth is.”

Markets have reacted to the news of the most recent reductions: The price of antimony [surged 40 percent](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Chinas-Export-Ban-Sends-Antimony-Prices-Soaring-40-in-One-Day.html) on news of China’s most recent export curbs. It was something that [worried](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6365955161112) Gary Evans, the CEO of US Antimony Corporation, the only domestic processor of antimony. Evans, speaking on Fox Business, worried that high prices would cause businesses to be priced out of the market.

Hollomon said that the Biden administration had often talked about building a supply chain independent from China, but that promised projects were often not followed through on, and that funding was held up at critical stages. China, on the other hand, has been able to fund projects and drive down costs for Chinese firms through massive injections of state capital into the mining, processing and industrial use of critical metals and transition technology. “We’ve been playing with our hands tied behind our backs—that is the way the West has been operating for the last 15 years,” he said.

But there is a more fundamental question at play as well. The United States traditionally limited technology transfers to China because of copyright concerns: This year, President Biden [imposed an 100 percent tariff](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/27/elon-musks-china-tesla) on Chinese electric vehicles. The US government [recently prepared restrictions](https://www.wsj.com/tech/u-s-prepares-new-ai-chip-restrictions-to-close-chinas-backdoor-access-a598d0fc) on the import of AI technology into China (Beijing [responded](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241209-china-probes-nvidia-for-violating-anti-monopoly-law) with an antitrust investigation into the US chip giant Nvidia), and Washington has been talking about “decoupling” from China for the last several years. In 2022, the US Department of Defense even released [a 74-page report on “securing” the supply](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/24/2002944158/-1/-1/1/DOD-EO-14017-REPORT-SECURING-DEFENSE-CRITICAL-SUPPLY-CHAINS.PDF) chain for materials used in military hardware. Chinese graphite is already subject to a 25 percent tariff in the US. (Last Wednesday, a North American trade association of active anode material producers asserted that such a tariff was “far too low” and [asked the US government](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-graphite-miners-ask-washington-impose-920-tariff-chinese-rivals-2024-12-18/) to levy a 920 percent tariff on Chinese graphite imports, a move that would [double the cost](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/12/19/antidumping-investigation-could-more-than-double-cost-of-u-s-ev-battery-energy-storage/) of an electric vehicle Stateside.) Why would China help the United States build a supply chain that subverts its own interests and diminishes market share for Chinese companies?

In the critical metals and renewable energy space, there is growing apprehension over the use of tariffs in a part of the world economy in which China has become king. “To me,” [Trump has said](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/harris-trump-election-10-16-2024/card/trump-calls-tariffs-the-most-beautiful-word--YMVPAupw4EjBRp6yobOy), “the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff.’” He has even suggested he would impose tariffs [of up to 60 percent](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/3/can-donald-trump-enact-tariffs-without-congress-and-can-anyone-stop-him) on Chinese goods. But while Washington seems to think of tariffs as a one-way street, China’s most recent show of force shows that Beijing has considerable leverage, especially when it comes to materials that are used in electric devices and vehicles.

In the end of the day, costs from tariffs usually get passed on to the consumer. Trump, who used fears of inflation to galvanize his base during the last election, will be wary of policies that cause too many shifts in prices. Antimony, after all, is not just in bullets; it is used as a flame retardant in roofing across the US.

Perhaps rising costs will mean the next administration will be more amenable to striking a deal with China’s premier, Xi Jinping, an autocratic leader [Trump reportedly admires](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/books/review/at-war-with-ourselves-hr-mcmaster.html). Elon Musk’s ties to China—around a half of Teslas are produced there, and the country is said to be [the world’s second-largest market](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/27/elon-musks-china-tesla) for the electric cars—might also complicate things. But that won’t solve the pressing issue of China’s domination of the supply chain for critical raw materials.

Industry players like Hollomon believe the incoming administration has the chance to spur domestic mining and processing through grants and streamlining regulations and building up the nation’s strategic reserve of minerals, many of which were sold off after the Cold War. But the outlook is also worrisome: increased tariffs have historically lead to retrenchment and stockpiling, which have tended to be ingredients in conflict. Even if such fears remain distant for now, a China in which the materials processing and battery industries are two bright spots in an otherwise bleak economic landscape is not likely to cede its primacy in those spaces any time soon.

**To:** Jim Sims <[Jim.Sims@niocorp.com](mailto:Jim.Sims@niocorp.com)\>  
**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible... 

 RESPONSE:

***""Very much so.""***

[NioCorp Completes Successful Initial Testing of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-completes-successful-initial-testing-of-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-recycling/)\*\*Also, the material news release above mentions *“As no economic analysis has been completed on the rare earth mineral resource comprising the Elk Creek Project, further testing and studies are required before determining whether extraction of REEs can be reasonably justified and economically viable after taking account of all relevant factors.”*

**Gotta ask.... �**�

*5) Where does Niocorp stand on achieving the funds to complete/update the ""early as possible 2024 F.S.""?     Does Niocorp foresee this completion date now being pushed into 2025 given some further testing is now needing to be completed? Please comment if possible...*

 RESPONSE:

***""We are working on several potential sources of funding to complete the work necessary to update our Feasibility Study.""***

My main goal is to become a trader at a top-tier firm that deals with oil/gas/energy (like Trafigura, Glencore, or Vitol). At the moment, I am still in my senior year of high school.

In addition, my father owns a one-hectare plot of land in Congo-Brazzaville, and I’d love to eventually start a business there focused on soft commodities (like coffee, cocoa, or other agricultural products).

**What education would you recommend :**

(Bachelor) —>  BBA at Saint Gallen’s University or Economics at the University of Geneva

(Master) —> Commodity trading at the University of Geneva, Master in finance (risk management and asset management oriented) or any graduate program of Trafigura, Glencore, etc

**What should I focus more on :**

1. Enjoying my youth
2. Books, podcasts, education, … (about commodities)
3. Academics
4. Getting in touch with the industry (networking and eventually internships)
5. Learning skills related to entry-level positions in the industry (please note them, I am thinking Excel, Python, PowerPoint)

**General questions :**

What is the typical career trajectory in commodity trading, starting from entry-level jobs or internships to becoming a trader, and eventually advancing to senior trader or head of trading? (I know that there are many different backgrounds but what is the classical/typical entry-level job that will lead to a trading desk)

  
What does the future of the commodity trading profession look like? Do you foresee a shift toward more STEM-oriented profiles dominating the industry? Additionally, are salaries expected to decrease further, considering that some parents of friends working in the industry have recently experienced pay cuts?

I’d be grateful for any insights or personal experiences you can share. Thank you for your help!",3,1735822968.0,Commodities,4,1.0,False

I’ve got a trip coming up to Melbourne from Sydney and would appreciate getting some thoughts on my rough itinerary from those more knowledgable and experienced. Open to any feedback and recommendations that I’ve missed that you think are worth checking out.

Also worth mentioning I visited once before back in summer 2017 with family and did most of the usual tourist attractions. Having said that there are some places (ACMI for example) that I’m planning to visit again.

My approach is to basically segment each day into Morning/Afternoon/Evening and do just 1 thing in each section, not counting eating a meal. Bonus if it’s all located in roughly the same area for convenience (and less time spent travelling)

# Details

4 night stay 

**Departing** \- Saturday 4th January 

* SYD-MELB flight 9:00am - 10:35am

**Returning** \- Wednesday 8th January

* MELB-SYD flight 7:00pm - 8:25pm 

I’ll be staying in the Docklands on the northern side of the water within walking distance to a tram stop. Don’t mind taking taxi/uber if that’s more convenient for a specific destination.

# Current itinerary

**Saturday (Day 1)**

Check in, wander around CBD, check out laneways and all that.

Probably grab lunch in Chinatown.

Maybe see Carlton Gardens.

Get to AAMI park for Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney kick off at 7:35pm. After the match I'll probably turn in early but might grab something quick to eat first.

**Sunday (Day 2)**

Would like to check out St Kilda beach and that general area as I've heard there’s some cool street markets. 

Don’t know if I’ll stay long enough to see the penguins (assuming it’s not closed off to visitors) as apparently they rock up at sunset like the little gangstas they are.

But if there’s enough to do and see for an entire day in that area then great, more of a chance to see the penguins (they're the selling point of the trip, forget the coffee /s)

**Monday (Day 3)**

Could alternatively do the beach on this day with the benefit of it likely being less crowded.

Tossing up between spending the morning plus having brunch at Queen Victoria Market or Prahran Market. The latter is more out the way but anecdotally I’ve heard it’s better.

There’s an exhibition at ACMI which I’d like to check out. So far I'm unable to get an answer on how long it usually takes to finish but will put aside at least 2hrs or so.

**Tuesday (Day 4)**

Got tickets to the tennis which starts at 4pm, not sure what to do before that. 

This day needs something for the morning/early afternoon section so recommendations are appreciated :) 

**Wednesday (Day 5)**

Hotel check out time at 10am. Decent chunk of time before return flight at 7pm. 

Maybe I could check out Fitzroy, Brunswick etc. and take my time heading back to the airport if that's practical?

# Possible other activities:

**NGV** \- did it during last trip but felt rushed and couldn’t really enjoy it so wouldn’t mind to see it again.

**Skydeck** \- also done during last trip but wouldn’t mind checking it out at night this time. Downside is it’s a fair bit of waiting for an ultimately brief experience.

Is there anything worth checking out in the **Docklands**? Since that’s where I’m staying it’d be good to find something in that area.

Is the **State Library** worth checking out? Maybe a guided tour?

Also bit of a tangent but during the last trip we went to an Italian place in South Melbourne which I’m pretty sure was called ‘Old Mates Pizza and Pasta’. Looks like it’s closed down but is there a slim chance they’ve moved/operating under a different name? I only ask because I remember the chicken parmi/parma/parmo/ being glorious.

He is feeling unsure about how to explore moving his relationship forward. He’s been Snapchatting with a girl for over a month, and from what he’s shared with me of their conversation, she seems genuinely interested in him. However, his anxiety has held him back from making any moves—he’s kept the conversation very platonic, even though some of her responses have come across as flirty.

I suggested he ask her to meet up for coffee, but he’s worried that might come off as boring or “lame.” So, I’m turning to you for advice:

- What are some low-pressure ways he could ask her to hang out?
 - How can he bring up the idea of spending time together in a way that feels casual and not too intimidating?
 - Are there specific things he could say to explore whether she’s open to something more than friendship?

I’ve been diving into the pourover game since Christmas and loving it. Currently brewing with a V60 and the Hario Mini Slim Plus, but I’m ready to upgrade my grinder. I’ve already bought a Fellow Stagg EKG, so now it’s time to level up the grind.

Looking for a grinder that’s *fast* (priority 1) and I'm willing to skip the €100 range to go straight to something around €200 if it really shaves off grind time.

Any recommendations? Cheers, and happy new brew year!

1hrt11k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1hrt11k/thank_you/,Thank you.,"Ever since I had covid 2 years ago, my life was turned upside down. Thanks to this community, I no longer believe I’m losing my mind.

It started just a few days after recovering from a nasty covid infection. I had my usual morning coffee, and suddenly felt like I was having a heart attack. I thought for sure I’d die. My partner called an ambulance. But there was nothing wrong with me. Blood pressure normal, if a bit low. Pulse elevated, but not dangerously so. All tests came back negative and normal. Verdict: Panic attack. Here, the journey started.

It became apparent very soon that this wasn’t an isolated incident. It happened every time I had coffee, without fail. So I stopped drinking coffee, and other caffeinated beverages. It happened when I was stressed, or emotional. It happened when I sat for too long without moving. It happened when standing. It happened when walking. It happened when I was too hot, or too cold. It happened when I didn’t get enough sleep, or didn’t drink enough water, or ate too little. The triggers were easily identifiable, but they made no sense to me.

Everywhere I turned, people kept saying it’s panic attacks. “Take antidepressants. Take anti-anxiety meds. Get therapy. Exercise more. It’s all in your head.”

And, sure. It always ENDED in a panic attack, because I was terrified I’d die. 

But no matter what everyone was saying, it didn’t make sense. I didn’t have anxiety (before, lol). My emotions were fine. Why would I get a panic attack while sitting at my desk and reading a book I enjoyed? Why would I get a panic attack after eating my favorite food? The doctors were adamant. So I took pills, went to therapy, tried, and tried, and tried. Nothing, apart from avoiding triggers as much as possible, helped. And my quality of life was declining with every attack of whatever this was, until I spend 90% of my time at home, clinging to my partner, afraid to be alone, afraid to do anything at all. I stopped going out. Stopped driving. Stopped going to concerts. Stopped having a life. 

And I’m not saying it’s much better now. I’m still terrified every day. But at least now I KNOW I am not crazy. These aren’t just panic attacks. I don’t have to keep beating myself up over why nothing is working, why no meds help, why no amount of mental health advice helps. 

So thank you. Thank you for being here, and sharing your stories. Not being alone in this makes a huge difference. I hope I’ll be able to cope with this, one day. ",6,1735822388.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

I told her how I haven't shot in years because I lost a lot of my passion when my brother passed away suddenly. 

She works in sports and she invited me to be her assistant for a few upcoming matches to get me out of my rut and to get me shooting again. 

Then things advanced more. We had a 6 hour phone call on Christmas day just getting to know one another and again the following day, when she invited me to meet for coffee so we went. I invested in a new lens specifically for the match and I showed her which one, and she seemed excited.

We met up, had a good time, I bought her dinner, and then she dropped me home, opened the door for me, hugged me and left. 

I have barely heard from her since. No message when she got home safe. 

I was wondering what I did wrong or how I potentially messed up. She's gone from calling me all the time, updating me about her day, to total radio silence. 

I checked in with her a few days ago and she said she is in a bad headspace at the moment as she is currently rehoming her dog. I wanted to respect her boundaries, so offered to back off completely and not reach out again if she wasn't feeling it. And she said that she is quiet with everyone at the moment and to not take it personally. So I offered to call her if she needed to vent, then gave her space and haven't messaged since. 

She's still following me on social media, watching all my IG stories, but she's basically been completely mute since we met up. 

The match she mentioned is tomorrow and I've not heard a thing from her. No happy new years, no update, nothing. I feel really awkward because while I understand she's going through an emotional time at the moment, I feel strung along. I got my hopes up for this, something that would massively help my career and get me back into my passion. And it was her idea to do this. 

I can't help but feel like an idiot getting my hopes up for this, only to be essentially ghosted and ignored. What's a positive way to look at this situation without getting too in the dumps about it?",1,1735822212.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I’m wondering- when is it typical for it to click for 18 month old? How can I help her sit longer on the potty (we’ve tried reading, singing, bubbles, mouth exercises) ? I have 5 more days before she’s going back to daycare :/ will practice help her?? 

we had made SO much progress over the past few days where she definitely knows she has to go, calls out for help consistently when bare bum, sometimes says “pee pee” and runs to the potty.  it’s hard to get her to sit on it for long enough though , we often do 2-3 potty runs, a short sit (1-2 min) then she starts peeing/pooing and we catch her and get her on the potty to finish. We did commando yesterday morning but she also had a bad babycino from a coffee shop and was literally $4itting herself in the pants all morning. No success on the potty until we went bare bum in the evening, catching mid stream. Earlier in the week we did have a few successful prompts on the potty, but only 1-2 a day. Rarely she does sit 5 min but 95% of the time nothing comes out, and we continue our potty back and forth (she says she needs to go, we sit , nothing, then she starts having an accident)

I added to this sheet almost daily. Every month had its only sheet and every day had its own row. I have data for every day of the year but for the purposes of this post, I’m showing the annual summary only. 

Summary:

I spent just over €44,000 in 2024

I saved €4,350 on top of what I already had

The data visualised:

[Monthly Saving Summary](https://i.imgur.com/D1z8gF2.png)

[Annual Spending and Savings](https://i.imgur.com/cORj9Vt.png)


It’s really good to see where my money goes. In general, my spending month on month is incredibly steady, which I found interesting. It spiked in April as I had to pay for car maintenance, a holiday and a birthday gift. It dipped in September as I was moving jobs and went a long period without getting paid. This is also why my savings dropped in September as I had to dip into them. Spending spiked again in November due to apartment expenses, clothes for weddings and Christmas gifts. My goal for the year was to have €10k in savings. I didn’t make it there, but I’ve had a good year. Now that I live with my partner, saving money should become easier in 2025.

I don’t see massive extravagance or waste anywhere here (some people might), so I don’t necessarily see areas to tighten up on. I have already started a new expenses tracker for 2025. I’ve edited my categories slightly to take account of my circumstances.

Some insights ahead of any questions I may get:

Rent: Includes bills. Dropped when I moved in with my boyfriend in October

Car Finance: Final payment was october. Also paid for my car tax in October

Car Insurance: Renewed in August, went up slightly after I moved address in October	

Gym: Changed to annual payment as it was cheaper

Phone bill: Changed to GoMo to reduce cost

Food (big shop): self explanatory I think

Food (other): snacking, coffees, breakfast rolls, deli for lunch, etc

Eating Out: self explanatory

Diesel: I need a car, this can’t be avoided

Parking: try to avoid this as much as possible

Tolls: see both previous comments	

Pub. Trans: try to use this as much as possible

Taxi: usually after a night out

Subscriptions: Apps, some are annual, some are monthly. I’ve cut back a lot here

Nights out/Drink: Mostly alcohol

Body: health and grooming 

Hols/Events: flights, accommodation or event tickets

Clothes: bought as needed. I’m not a big shopper

AOB: everything else: car maintenance, gifts, amazon purchases.

All shared expenses with my boyfriend are split exactly 50/50 through a joint account. 

I also have a pension, completely separate from this. It has approx. €40k at the moment.

Let me know if you have any comments/insights. This is my first time doing this. My excel is very figures heavy so I tried to make it more visually appealing.

1hrspja,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hrspja/has_anyone_successfully_helped_their_family/,Has anyone successfully helped their family realise the truth about Mormonism? ,"My 'family' (more on that later) is predominantly Mormon on both sides, and have been for many years, so as you can imagine they are pretty die hard Mormons. I left the church when I was 13 or 14 (now 18) much to everyone's disapproval. I am the only non-member in my immediate family and my parents make sure to remind me of how much they disapprove, despite it being several years since I have attended church. Lately its been wearing me down, my lifestyle couldn't be further from Mormonism, e.g working on Sundays, dating, enjoying coffee and alcoholic beverages ect. I don't make an effort to hide these things like I used to.

Anyway, I'm now treated as 'second class' for lack of a better word. It's a very disconnected feeling, its like my parents have given up on me in a way, since they'll be in the celestial kingdom while ill be sent to outer darkness lmao.

Without sounding pretentious, my parents invest very little in me; we go weeks without conversation. On the contrary, my sister who is still very much Mormon is their 'favorite'. She has had 2 Europe trips funded by my parents in the last year, shes unemployed lol. Anyway, that's not what bothers me, recently despite all of this, I can't help but feel like I want to build a somewhat healthy relationship with them.

Expanding on the 'family' from before, I was adopted through LDS family services. So from the beginning there was already a disconnect, without going into detail my 'parents' can bear their own child. So I was a sort of last resort considering how much emphasis is put on bearing children in the church.

My 'Dad' especially has been so vague in my life, now more than ever. After maturing a little, I have realised whether I like it or not, i'm stuck with them and I may as well try to make it a positive relationship. Although a part of me feels like they have already made up their mind about me.

I dream one day they will see through all the Mormon bullshit and that we will finally be a 'normal family'.

So that brings me back to my question, has anyone successfully helped their family realise the truth about Mormonism?

Here's a little review for people deciding next year:

* The box is very nice and feels premium. This is a great gift.
* Inside you get a little booklet to keep tasting notes on each coffee.
* Each box contains a 50g bag and a card with a little bit of info and a QR code.
* The QR code leads to a dedicated coffee website [like this one](https://thebarn.de/products/inspiration-day1). You get a video of the producer giving some background, some pictures from the farm, extended tasting notes, etc. I'm not one to scan QR codes, usually, but I'm glad I did this time, this was a surprisingly nice touch.

The first day was an anaerobic natural Geisha from Volcan Azul. Their notes were adamant that it wasn't actually that ""anaerobic natural""-y, but it was imo (if you like those, I think it was a very nice one). [Here are my notes for this coffee.](https://beano.app/@michihuber/day-1-volcan-azul-gesha)

So first impression: this is a very nice gift. It's pricy at 175 Euro, but feels very premium. I do like the format of 50g/coffee, this is great for exploring coffees I wouldn't buy full bags of. Though I'm not sure I'd want to go with a single roaster vs. KaffeBox.

## Unveiling the Power of the Smart Keurig Coffee Maker: A Deep Dive into Automated Brewing

The quest for the perfect cup of coffee is a journey many embark on.  For those seeking convenience, customization, and seamless integration into a smart home, the smart Keurig coffee maker emerges as a compelling contender. This in-depth guide explores its features, capabilities, and potential drawbacks, helping you decide if this automated brewing system is the right fit for your caffeine routine.

## Understanding BrewID Technology: The Heart of Smart Brewing

The smart Keurig coffee maker's core innovation lies in its **BrewID technology**. This intelligent system recognizes the specific K-Cup pod inserted, instantly accessing a database of optimal brewing parameters curated by coffee experts. Gone are the days of guessing the perfect brew settings – BrewID ensures each K-Cup delivers its intended flavor profile, consistently and reliably. This means bolder brews from bolder roasts, and lighter, brighter flavors from lighter roasts, all without any manual adjustments on your part.  The result? A consistently delicious cup, tailored to the specific coffee bean.

## Beyond the Basics: Exploring Barista Mode and App Integration

The smart Keurig coffee maker transcends simple brewing; it elevates the experience.  Through the user-friendly Keurig app (available on both iOS and Android), you unlock **Barista Mode**. This feature provides step-by-step guidance for crafting a range of coffeehouse-style beverages, from velvety lattes to frothy cappuccinos. The app's intuitive interface makes even complex recipes surprisingly simple, transforming your kitchen into a personal barista station.

But the app's functionality extends beyond specialty drinks. The WiFi connectivity allows for **scheduling brews ahead of time**, ensuring a freshly brewed cup awaits you when you wake up.  The ability to **brew remotely** adds another layer of convenience, letting you start your coffee from anywhere with an internet connection – perfect for those chilly mornings when you’d rather stay snuggled in bed.

## Mastering Customization: Strength, Temperature, and More

Personalization is key, and the smart Keurig delivers.  With **five strength settings and six temperature settings**, you can fine-tune your brew to match your precise preferences. Whether you prefer a bold, intense cup or a delicate, nuanced one, the machine adapts to your taste.  Furthermore, the **MultiStream Technology** ensures even saturation of the coffee grounds, maximizing flavor extraction and minimizing that bitter aftertaste some Keurig users experience with older models. This results in a richer, more flavorful cup, regardless of your chosen strength or K-Cup.

The machine's versatility extends to brew size, offering **six options ranging from 2 oz to 12 oz**.  This caters to various needs, from a quick espresso-style shot to a large mug for a lazy afternoon.

## The Power of Froth: Enhancing Your Coffee Creations

The integrated **hot and cold frother** is a game-changer for those who enjoy milk-based beverages.  With **three hot frothing speeds and a cold setting**, you can create perfectly textured milk foam for lattes, cappuccinos, and other specialty drinks.  Whether you prefer using dairy milk, plant-based alternatives, or even just a touch of foam for added texture, the frother provides the control you need.  Cleaning the frother is also relatively straightforward, ensuring easy maintenance.

## Smart Home Integration: Seamless Connectivity

The smart Keurig seamlessly integrates into your smart home ecosystem.  Compatibility with **Amazon Alexa and Google Home** allows for voice control, making brewing your coffee as simple as a voice command.  Imagine starting your day with a simple """"Hey Google, brew me a coffee!""""  This level of convenience is a true highlight of this smart coffee maker.

## Addressing Common Concerns and Pain Points

**Convenience:** Scheduling brews is incredibly simple through the Keurig app.  You can set specific times for brewing, ensuring a fresh cup is ready when you need it. Remote brewing functionality allows you to initiate the brewing process from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Customization:** Adjusting strength and temperature is intuitive via the app or the machine's control panel.  The six brew sizes cater to different preferences and mug sizes.

**Efficiency and Maintenance:** The frother is easy to use and clean. While specific maintenance reminders aren't explicitly stated, many smart coffee makers, including Keurig models, are designed to be energy-efficient by automatically powering down when not in use.  Regular descaling is recommended to maintain optimal performance.

**Integration and Compatibility:** The Keurig app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices.  Integration with smart home systems like Amazon Alexa and Google Home is seamless.

##  Keurig K-Cup Compatibility: A Vast Selection

The smart Keurig coffee maker maintains full compatibility with the vast range of **Keurig K-Cups**.  This ensures access to a huge selection of coffee blends, flavors, and roasts, catering to all tastes and preferences.  From classic black coffee to flavored lattes, the possibilities are endless.

## Smart Keurig Coffee Maker Reviews: What Users Are Saying

While this guide provides a comprehensive overview, reading independent reviews from reputable sources like Zmescience or checking the Keurig website provides valuable user perspectives. These reviews often highlight specific experiences and can provide additional insights into the machine's long-term performance and reliability.  Paying attention to both positive and negative reviews can give you a well-rounded understanding before making a purchase.


## Conclusion: Your Smart Coffee Journey Begins Now

The smart Keurig coffee maker is more than just a coffee machine; it's a personalized brewing system designed for convenience, customization, and seamless integration into your smart home.  Its intuitive app, advanced brewing technology, and smart home compatibility make it a strong contender for those seeking an effortless yet sophisticated coffee experience.  Whether you're a seasoned coffee connoisseur or a casual coffee drinker, the smart Keurig offers a compelling blend of convenience and customization to elevate your daily routine.  Weigh the features against your needs and preferences, and you'll be well-equipped to determine if this smart coffee maker is the perfect addition to your kitchen.

Coming from Eureka Olympus,"Hoping to improve the taste of my espresso's and looking at the grinder. Currently using a Eukera Olympus 75 HS, with the 75 mm Mythos burrs (and the small hopper with bellows). This was a big upgrade six years ago, taste wise, to my previous grinder, a Mazzer SJ. Much more body to the shot. Machine has always been a Bezzera Strega lever.

I've been shifting to lighter roasts the last couple of years, can't stand the ashy taste of dark roasts anymore, but I do feel a lot of my shots, from different beans, all sort of taste the same. They're not bad, but just not so interesting. Sometimes a bit papery, and a bit on the acidic side too. Only very occasionally do I detect the taste notes on the bag, but that's usually only so with some naturals. If I take home a bag after sampling it at a roastery, it often just tastes boring at home.

Been playing around with pre infusion pressure and time, shot lengths, but that mostly seems to control acidity, not so much deepness of taste. Also tried an E&B basket (the one with the fancy coating), which made all coffee taste bland, without body, and overly light crema too, so switched back to my IMS Competition. Usually aim for a 2:1 ratio.

Now I've been reading these 98 mm grinders really bring out the separate taste notes, especially on light roasts. The Lagom 01 looks very enticing, nicer workflow and less retention than my Olympus too. However I also read about them not bringing forth much body. Obviously they're a good chunk of change, and don't know if will give me the same bump in espresso quality as going from the SJ to the Olympus.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1735820111.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I have two questions about negative effects","Tea often makes me sleepy. With coffee it's hard to tell what it does to me (if anything), I'd need to drink it more times to be able to tell.

1. Will I develop dependence and addiction even when I don't really feel the effects? 

2. Apparently caffeine before sleeping makes you sleep worse. Does it still work the same way if it literally doesn't wake me up or gets me more sleepy? I drink black tea in the evening, sometimes even a few cups, don't find it hard to fall asleep, it can be easier. Is the quality of sleep still worse?

1hrsc08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hrsc08/migraine_head_pressure_8_days_now/,Migraine + head pressure 8 days now,"28f I have had a migraine that started Thursday of last week, I normally will take excedrin or ibuprofen at the start of it. If it gets worse then I will take imitrex as my last resort. I went to the dr on Friday, didn’t do much just discussed triggers and changed my headache medicine to rivovastin, works wonderful. However, Friday night I smoked weed with my husband as a spur of the moment thing and it amplified my migraine, I felt like I was having the worst migraine of my life, the top of my head was throbbing so bad, I was in tears. It was very intense.. I took meds and I fell asleep and woke back up with that same migraine and head pressure it was now located in the back of my head. Went to ER and they didn’t take me seriously, pain was 10/10, they told me it would be a few hours… so I went to Urgent care and they gave me a migraine cocktail through IV, worked wonders. It went away within 15 mins and slept a good portion of that day. Anyways later on that night I ended up needing to take medicine. Long story short I have continuously had this migraine on and off but constant pressure in my head. I have throbbing pain in my head from bending over or standing up too quick. It’s been 8 days now, I am up now concerned with the lingering pain in my head. I have never had pain last this long. Any suggestions? A few random side notes idk if are important: my period was weird this month. It’s normal flow 2-3 days and done. This month it was longer 5-6 days and just straight dark brown blood. I took a pregnancy test, came out neg. Umm I have been peeing like once every hour during the day and it was having me wake up in the middle of the night to pee. No odor, pee is almost clear by how much water I’ve consumed during my headache.. cramps, I thought maybe UTI or bladder infection, did a e-visit and taking Duricef just to be safe, on day 2 of abx and the urgency stopped.. and lastly I have went cold turkey on drinking coffee, every now and then I get cluster migraines because of how much caffeine I drink and I have to take a break from drinking it, thought I maybe having caffeine withdrawals but I doubt it would last this long? This feels different. Any thoughts of what may be wrong with my head.. I just want to be back to normal.",1,1735819916.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Hello r/MMORPG !

I've posted here previously about the game I've been developing, WalkScape. In short, it's an MMORPG inspired by RuneScape where you gain progress by walking in real life. Steps are counted even if the app is not open, so every step you take while your phone is in your pocket is counted for.

The game is currently in Closed Beta, and we have an open wave right now until 7th of January. You can start playing the game instantly if you support the development through our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape). You can also check [https://walkscape.app/help](https://walkscape.app/help) for more instructions on how to join, including joining the queue for the Closed Beta if you don't want to or can't support the development!

I'm an indie dev and we have three other people working on the game, and I want to emphasize that this game will **not be P2W** or have any predatory monetisation practises. The idea came to me as I'm a computer scientist student who is sitting a lot and I also have ADHD and needed a game to motivate myself to be more active. So combining RuneScape style game to walking felt like a great combination to get myself up and walking.

For more information about the game, I recommend to check out [the introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaQeb5Rapg) to the game or check out r/WalkScape and our website. We have currently around 20k people in the Closed Beta. The game is available for Android and iOS, and we're planning the Open Beta release for this year.

I'll be here answering any comments and questions about the game! Thank you all, and happy walking <3",23,1735819844.0,MMORPG,5,0.78,False
