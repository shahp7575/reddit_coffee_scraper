I’ve been very sick for 6 days now and not getting better, I thought I’d be better by now and could get the writing finalized by the deadline but I just don’t think it’s going to be possible. 

Is it at all possible I could email admissions and ask for an extension on just the writing materials due to my illness? I’m not quite sure. Let me know what you guys think. 

I don’t want it to reflect negatively on my application but I’m not sure what else to do with how sick I am! I keep opening my computer to write and almost falling asleep despite coffee and DayQuil. ",1,1767574963.0,gradadmissions,0,1.0,False

Well... My girlfriend and I were just watching videos on TikTok, laughing at whatever stupid thing came up, until one particular video came on that I feel like ruined our whole holiday season.

The video says ""a cake who cuts itself"" before changing to an image of a cake with the trans flag. I could immediately notice how the glow on my girlfriend's face completely disappeared; I felt terrible after that, since my girlfriend had problems with cutting for almost 6 years.

Everything was going great during our holiday season; it had been almost two months without any depressive episodes, And since the day before New Year's she's been super down and I just don't know what to do, because it's been months since I've seen her so bad.

I simply need some idea beyond what I'm already doing for her: making her coffee every day, asking her how she is, trying to let her know I'm there for her.

I honestly could not understand the mass hysteria around this mediocre product. I was expecting something really good, but instead got a slightly more sour Kahlúa with less body. Don’t hate me, I already feel like the crazy one. Maybe my bottle was old? 

Whatever it was, I never understood “cold brew” as a marketing gimmick anyways. Cold brew coffee already tastes like the underside of a river a lot of the time. Why wouldn’t you infuse the coffee in the alcohol or properly brew it? I don’t get it.

Honorable mentions: Noilly Prat Dry and Luxardo Maraschino. I do not get why this bad French vermouth is seen as a baseline of quality. Just trash. Tastes unpleasant and unbalanced and ruins a martini, and probably has ruined martinis for a lot of people unknowingly. 

Luxardo Maraschino on the other hand, is certainly a bottle I would keep for certain cocktails. But as a standalone ingredient, it’s probably the worst tasting bottle behind the bar. I love kirschwasser, which tastes similar, but making that fermented, vegetal cherry flavor extra strong and sickly sweet is a mistake. Maraschino is nice in really small amounts to me. The amount in a Last Word is pure hell. ",10,1767574603.0,cocktails,8,0.71,False

1q4779y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1q4779y/venezuelan_defiance_science_fiction/,Venezuelan defiance: science fiction.,"This is Caracas. The hour doesn’t matter as much as the feeling—because the feeling is the hour now.

The room is ordinary: a fan that clicks a little as it turns, a plastic chair that squeaks when you shift, a cup of coffee gone cold because no one is actually drinking it. The TV is too loud and not loud enough. It fills the apartment, but it can’t contain what it’s saying.

On the screen: the words you never want attached to your country—operation, custody, capture, transfer, national security, order restored—all those clean, polished phrases that always mean the same dirty thing when you’ve lived long enough to recognize the pattern. The anchor’s tone is calm. That calm is what makes you nauseous. Calm means they’ve decided this is acceptable.

Your body reacts before your politics does. A hot wave in the chest. A tightening in the throat. Not just anger—something older and more intimate: violation. The specific kind that comes when someone puts their hand on your door handle and acts like it’s normal.

You’ve lived under pressure for years. Shortages. Fear. Corruption. Exhaustion. The constant, grinding reality of surviving inside a system that has failed too many people. You know your government has harmed you. You know people have been oppressed. You’ve argued with family about it. You’ve watched friends leave. You’ve had nights where you said, this can’t keep going.

But none of that makes this feel okay.

Because this is different. This is someone else claiming the right to decide the fate of your country as if you are an afterthought. Like you’re a chessboard, not a home. Like “Venezuela” is a problem to be handled, not a nation of human beings with dignity.

And the worst part is the smugness—how familiar it is. The way they frame it as rescue. As order. As “saving” you from yourselves. You’ve heard that story before. Latin America has heard that story for generations. It always arrives in a suit. It always speaks the language of morality. And it always costs you something you can’t get back.

Your phone buzzes.

Messages come in—fast, overlapping, emotional. Some people you know hate the regime and still type: “This is a violation.” Others are furious in all caps. Someone sends a flag. Someone sends a photo from years ago: a protest, a crowd, a sign that says soberanía. You realize, with a strange clarity, that this is one of those moments that compresses differences. You can be against oppression and still be against imperialism. You can want change and still refuse humiliation.

Because sovereignty isn’t a luxury you earn by being perfect. It’s a baseline. It’s the dignity of being allowed to struggle and solve your own crises without a foreign power treating you like a failed experiment.

You think about how it will be spun online.

How strangers will speak about your country like it’s a concept, not a place where your aunt makes soup, where your cousin works double shifts, where you learned songs as a kid, where you still remember the smell of rain on hot pavement. How they’ll say, good, finally, as if the only thing that matters is that their team feels righteous.

And you feel something harden—not into hatred, but into refusal.

No, you don’t have to pretend everything inside Venezuela is fine to know this is wrong. You don’t have to defend the government to defend the people. You don’t have to accept a violation just because you’re tired.

You sit closer to the TV without meaning to, like your body wants to guard the room from what’s coming through the screen. Your jaw clenches. Your eyes burn. You don’t cry like this often, but the tears show up anyway—not the soft kind, the furious kind, the kind that says: you don’t get to do this to us and call it help.

And somewhere under the anger there’s something steadier: a recognition that you are not alone in this feeling. That a large part of the country—maybe half, maybe more—can be fractured on a thousand issues and still share this one instinctive truth:

We are not a playground. We are not a lesson. We are not a trophy.

Solidarity doesn’t always look like agreement. Sometimes it looks like a line you draw together in the sand.

And tonight, the line is simple:

1q476u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AliceInBorderlandLive/comments/1q476u1/ending_season_3_with_a_poorly_written_cliff/,Ending season 3 with a poorly written cliff hanger was a terrible choice.,"Hey all! I’m new to this sub and I just finished season 3. I enjoyed the show but I felt like the cliffhanger in the US with the “Alice” name tag was fucking stupid and  unnecessary. It should have ended with Arisu and Usagi choosing baby names and to all the survivors are doing ok and appreciate life a lot more now and it’s clearly interpreted that they are gonna have to play those games multiple times throughout their life and it seems like the main cast has come to terms with it. I’ll tell you why I think it’s stupid.

1. The games are clearly conducted by super powerful and all knowing enigmatic entities or entity and it’s assumed this is happening all over the world(at least that’s my interpretation). Why the fuck is that entity a waitress?and why is she specifically in the US? Like bro there are countries with a bigger population with much more densely populated cities throughout the world and this entity is in the US in a coffee shop of all places? There were earthquakes all over the world and it didn’t seem like the earthquakes were big enough to cause severe casualties like the meteor did. I know something bigger is coming but still it doesn’t make any sense.

2.  This is the biggest fuck up in my view. It is very clear to anyone who watches any kind of anime or consumes Japanese media that Alice is Arisu(Japanese Phonetics) and the show title is “Alice in Borderland” which is basically “Arisu in borderland”. Excuse me? What the fuck are they trying to do? Trying to have easy way to milk the IP in the future? Squid games had a similar ending and it worked but it doesn’t really work here. 

Idk bro the ending really bummed me out. The writing and screenplay was excellent throughout for me but they should have quit while they were ahead. Idk I might be wrong. Please share your thoughts.",0,1767574329.0,AliceInBorderlandLive,5,0.5,False
1q47685,https://www.reddit.com/r/openheartsurgery/comments/1q47685/openheart_surgery_guidance_from_the_hospital_is/,Open-heart surgery guidance from the hospital is pretty generic,"I had double valve repair and aneurysm repair last year (major surgery as you know) and was surprised at the big white cardiac patient booklet they gave me.. and likely gave to every other patient over the last 5 years. *""Read this"",* they said. Then ""*if you don't have time to read the whole thing, read chapters 3,6 and 8 at least""*. THAT'S IT. Then bang.. surgery time. Don't get me wrong, I had great care at the hospital but that's it. At home, it was all on me. They know we're going to spend hours on Google... with many of us no doubt getting misinformed from bad info and all adding to our anxiety. I wanted to fix this. So, I built an app for patients that pulls in every single thing i learned from my journey, all my research on the cardiac surgery process and everything from the dozens of patient interviews I done in the last year. It uses AI but is responsibly built, safe and with correct guardrails in place. If anyone would like access send me a DM. Fellow patients (and caregivers for that matter) have found it helps them get the right info in bite-size conversational format from an empathetic guide. For me, even a year and a half out I'm using it for emotional support and its been awesome. Its not intended to replace doctors in any way... but to help us during appointments.. help us ask more questions without being embarrassed or annoy anyone. The best part is, its here just for ME... it doesn't get tired, doesn't need coffee breaks and most of all does not need to visit 38 other patients at the same time. Dreaming ahead, i think it would be awesome for any patient who is a candidate for surgery would be given an app like this (along with that generic patient booklet if they want) to help them prep and recover.. because going down hour long rabbit holes trying to find more info is scary and exhausting..

I’ve survived a 28-degree heatwave with no air con and a single fan from Argos. Blimey. The weather here isn’t climate — it’s a personal attack. You step outside and you’re instantly sweating like a wrong ’un, knackered, and deeply regretful.

Perf is miles from anywhere. Aussies say, “Just down the road,” which is taking the piss. Back home, that’s a different town and a new accent. Here it’s three hours, no shade, and a lizard giving you evils. Madness.

Everyone’s fit. Surfing before work, jogging for fun — give over. I went for a gentle stroll and nearly passed away. Locals just smiled and said “no worries, mate,” which I don’t trust. In Britain, that means someone’s absolutely fuming.

The wildlife’s dodgy. Birds screaming, spiders paying rent, snakes like it’s normal. Bit much, innit. Back home, a fox in a bin makes the local news. Here, a snake could nick your lunch and people would crack on.

Coffee’s annoyingly proper good. Fish and chips, though? State of it. Skinny chips with aioli. Aioli! How daft! Fish and chips should be eaten with vinegar, possibly in the rain, and with dignity. This lot have got ideas above their station.

I miss rain, queues, and a good whine. Australians are too cheerful, too honest, not enough quiet resentment. Suspicious behaviour, if you ask me.

Still… Perf’s growing on me. Beaches are lush, sky’s showing off, and life’s oddly chilled. Don’t tell anyone, but I’m chuffed, in a grumpy, sunburnt sort of way.

Right. I’m off to sit in the shade, call the heat a piss-take, and complain.

It always juts out at the bottom and is way too big for my body. My arms and legs and butt and chest and everything else are really slim, twiggy even, and when I'm not stuffed full of food, I weigh 108 at 5'2 (female btw). I don't understand, I know there could be several reasons for it, but my doctor didn't tell me which one it might be. There's genetic predisposition to have a naturally bigger stomach, there's SIBOS, candida overgrowth, visceral fat in general, bad gut health, etc, etc. I told my doctor ""I know that there's a bacterial microbiome we have in our gut, and so I don't know if mine is damaged or not. I just feel fat all the time, and I just wish my stomach was flat.""          She responded with asking if I have constipation, I said yes, everyday, sometimes don't poop for 3. She got me an X-ray and said: ""See, you're all backed up there."" I had poop all throughout my intestines, stuck. She said the constipation was trapping gas and causing me to bloat. (Help!! I've had diarrhea which is said to clear the intestines fully out, and only had a slightly smaller stomach, then I've also drank coffee and pooped literal pounds, still not that flat, and most recently, I've eaten lots of fiber and pooped alot too, STILL not that flat.) So I said: ""How do I get a flatter stomach then? Like this?"" I even proceeded to show her my stomach being flat, using my hand to push it back into me. And that was when I brought up the microfiber thing again, and talked about my constipation. Her next response was: ""So yeah, just drink lots of water and eat more fiber, and you'll be flat as a wall, just like that."" That referring to how my stomach looked when I was pushing it in. Of pooping so much by way of coffee, diarrhea, and fiber and water, I have never been as flat as I showed her that day. Only a bit flatter. I haven't been eating fiber very long, only about three days. It's been whole grain wheat bread, apples, watermelon, plain zoi Greek yogurt w/honey, lots of water, avocado, hard boil egg, scramble egg, and banana. Also, a little bit of pork with lots of mushrooms and some jalapeno. I've tried several things before this though. 1) Small calorie deficit of only 300, 2) Complete starvation for like a week while walking 10-12k steps like crazy), 3) Small calorie deficit of only 300 whole walking 10-12k steps each day, 4) Complete starvation and little movement. In the past, I'd even done yoga for 3 months, all sorts of core exercises and full body exercises. Nothing I do changes any of my body, but I don't care about that, I only care about the fact that NONE of my stomach is changing.

1q46yvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmicmessenger/comments/1q46yvf/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

I went grocery shopping with my husband today and wasn’t able to carry on as normal afterwards. The whole time I was feeling pretty lightheaded and uncomfortable and began having Braxton hicks. I stopped at the nearest coffee shop and got some water and took it easy for about 30 minutes as by the time we had finished shopping my heart was racing and the Braxton hicks weren’t going away. 

On the way home I started having menstrual cramp-like pains at consistent intervals. I decided I would go straight to bed once we got home, and I would drink some more water to see if the contractions subsided on their own. After about an hour, they went away on their own. 

Maybe 3 hours later, I get up to try to help my husband prepare dinner (I wanted to cook but he wanted me to rest, so I mostly sat and helped where I could). I started having the same Braxton hicks and the pain has moved into my back and I’m also having the menstrual cramping pain. It isn’t unbearable, and with some of the contractions I only feel tightness. I have been in the ER once before for prodromal labor at 28 weeks and I was having consistent contractions with a toco reading of 70 without any other signs of labor progression and was sent home. I am having the same feelings today. It also feels like I am extremely gassy and need to poop but every time I try I just get this extreme sharp rectal pressure that doesn’t lead to anything coming out. 

Out of fear, I checked my cervix, and it feels soft and I was actually able to stick one finger in my cervix (I have felt my cervix before and it usually feels hard and closed). My baby feels extremely low but is moving as normal. If anyone can provide any insight or advice it would be greatly appreciated as this is my very first time doing this.

Not so interested in just standard portrait or fashion photography but also open to shoots involving traditional outfits or costumes such as kimono, saree, etc. You don't need experience or traditional model looks at all, just be fun and open minded. I most prefer a model who offers a degree of input and their own ideas. I am happy to treat you to a coffee or drink if you would like to meet up beforehand to decide if you are comfortable shooting, for example. You will also receive all the photos and can use them as you wish (for example on your own socials, etc.--as long as you give me credit).

This all started a few years ago when I joined the technical division. I worked many weeks with different types of wood but the one that stood out the most to me was cedar wood. I just really enjoyed working with it and making ""art"" pieces with it.

But one day I had a chip of it on my desk while having my lunch and I just used it to stir my coffee. And BAM the neurons connected just right. I was genuinely surprised. 
Now at the moment I thought maybe it's the shitty coffee we have at base or maybe im just tired or something.

So curiosity got the best of me and I tried it at home and I got the same reaction. After that I just kept trying my coffee with different wood or wood waste like saw dust. But no other wood gave such flavor as cedar. 

So now every once in a while I either put a chip of it in my coffee or a bit of cedar dust. (BTW black coffee no sugar)",9,1767573129.0,self,11,1.0,False

Eating food that doesn't excite me feels like trying to chew a mouthful of wet sand, so I'm constantly looking for pleasure in delivery/takeout just to get myself to eat.","I have a massive problem with fast food and delivery apps because it seems like I constantly crave titillation from my meals. I am very much able to cook, but doing it consistently and nourishing myself over long periods of time with relatively healthful, homemade meals is something I have NEVER been able to accomplish. I struggle a LOT with the day-in, day-out maintenance of eating like a normal human. As a result my diet has gotten horrible and I need to re-strategize here.

I typically put off eating throughout the day because I am terrible at time management and often i convince myself I operate better on coffee until a big meal at dinnertime. But of course by then I'm tired and don't want to do anything and give in to delivery apps. Every time! And I wake up hating myself, rinse and repeat. Let's say I cook a delicious batch of chili, by the third serving I am sick of it and want to get some takeout.

But it's also the fact that sometimes I will spend thirty minutes to an HOUR trying to figure out the ""perfect"" restaurant to get my meal from, craving that rush from satisfying the urge. I feel like adhd has exacerbated my relationship with food's problems until now I find myself at this point.

Looking for any input or advice/strategies for dealing with this if you've gone through something similar. I'd also love to heal about valuable pantry-stable/freezer-stable foods that help you in situations like this, or meals that can be assembled easily and relatively healthfully with very little actual cooking.",6,1767572907.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1q46lrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q46lrm/blackout_zone_five/,Blackout Zone Five,"Honestly when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I’m not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in 95 they talk about the riots in LA.

They don’t remember the sirens screaming all night. They don’t remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities, almost the whole state. 

I was one of the few who stayed, some couldn’t leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors, in reality we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or uncle sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice of prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this or washed up veterans or ex cops. As for me, I had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves or in pairs if they feel like we’re important. I wish I was that lucky but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. Then again when we’re not doing Washington’s dirty work we’re holed up somewhere, licking our wounds out of the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies, as for me. I always believed in safety in numbers, plus they tend to attack groups of people. 

I tended to shack up in this big church, some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually it was just me, the pastor and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. It was a nice spot actually, the pastor always kept the fire going, and had some beds set out in the main worship area. 

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands, instant of course. But hey I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas with the absence of sugar. I took another sip as I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets with lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window to see the snow was starting to pick up, snowflakes began to gently tap the window.

I was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket for it and glanced down at the miniscule screen to see a radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and trasped over to my bag to my SINCGARS radio and set it up real quick, setting it to single channel and plain text, then punching in the freq. I took hold of the receiver and began to speak into it.

“Scepter to Nest, radio check over”

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

“Hearing you, got some work for you”.

“Hit me”.

“Got a hit from the marines saying there’s some unusual activity in the mall on grover street, they want a specialist to look into it.”

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh.

“Could they be more specific?” 

There was a short pause before nest finally responded.

“Some of the grunts said they heard coming from the old mall, not sure how its possible”.

“Yeah me neither, well I’ll start hoofing it there”

“Oh no need for that, there’s a convoy that you can hitch a ride with to the mall.”

I furrowed my brow 

“How did you manage that?”

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end.

“I have my ways, get geared, they're gonna pick you up soon”.

“I hear, scepter over and out”.

I said as I hung up the receiver and gathered up my gear. Of course it really wasn’t much, half of it was old surplus shit from vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that weren’t completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit and clipped on my gas mask bag to my hip. I grabbed my alice and my weapon case and walked outside as I could hear the sound of diesel engines rumbling closer outside. 

I walked outside to see a six vehicle convoy of weathered humvees and five ton trucks driving down the snow covered street with a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver side window to get a better look at me.

“You the collector?” He asked the gas mask, muffling his voice.

I nodded and he thumbed behind him. 

“Hop in man, we’ll drop you off on the way”.   

I didn’t waste any time and quickly threw my things in the back of the covered five ton. I chambered into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched over shapes of marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed as some shivered in their MOPP gear. Some opted to not wear their gas masks as lit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed alice packs filled the empty space from across the benches. I settled in my icey seat as a few of the marines offered grunts of acknowledgement. 

The truck let out a hiss before speeding off with delay. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines as the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hit my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half buried wreckages of cars and remains of what were once police checkpoints. 

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger marines turned to look at me. A question deep in his mind.

“I gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain’t most of you civies?”

I snapped out of my own trance as I pivoted to him. I offered a shrug

“Most of us are, but we all got our reasons. Just like all of you I’m sure”.

“But we’re kind of forced to be here. You can just leave…right?” He asked naively and I quietly scoffed at this.

“You must be new around here, we can’t leave even if we wanted to”.

This seemed to deflate his desire to ask more questions as his shoulders slumped but he remained silent. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole that had no doubt only gotten bigger from the year or so of non-existent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved hands never letting go even after death, some clutched icey weapons that could never save them. All too common sight nowadays, a constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multistory behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon that was once a mall. its numerous frosted over windows hide its spiraling depths from my vision. I could feel the five ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word I stood up from my seat and dropped my gear out of the truck before hopping out myself with a grunt. 

“Good luck collector” 

One of the marines bid me as I departed. I took a deep breath before reaching for my carrier bag on my hip for my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The marines only stared at me as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices. I reached for the receiver that hung on the straps of my bag and quickly keyed in.

“Nest I’m on site, not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.”

“Standard as in…?”  she responded with a pause for me to elaborate.

“Not seeing any shells, still some bodies around. Atleast not any fresh ones. Gonna load up over.”

“Well you know the deal, try to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can”.

“Got it”. I said as I hung up my handset on the strap of my bag. I kneeled down and began to key in my code for the case. With a soft click it slotted open. I grabbed my thirty eight and my twelve gauge. I began to load it up with double ought buckshot. I chambered a shell into the chamber and quietly walked over to the smashed front door. 

The interior was dimly lit from the half covered sky light. I could still see the outlines of abandoned storefronts hanging in the empty interior. Trash and various articles of debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half shattered as my boots crunched under shards of glass.

“Making entry” I quietly spoke into my handset as I stepped inside. 

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred doors spiraled ahead of me.

“Copy get me a live feed scepter.” 

Next responded with a less carefree tone. I reached for the shoulder mounted. I switched it on and set it to record.

“Live feed up”. I replied as I slung my shotgun up.

“Patching in, standby”. She stated as my camera made a few whirring noises. I reached for my belt and grabbed a flashlight, quickly switching it on to illuminate the long hallway, finally I could hear static from my radio as nest finally chimed in. 

“Alrighty, patched in! You know what to do. I’ll keep watching the feed”.

“On it” I responded softly as I carefully walked past some of the shadowy storefronts. I shined my light in as I made my way past.

The fronts that weren’t barred were completely barren from looting. I could feel the bitter air still clutch me tightly in its frigid embrace. My mask lenses fogged up slightly as I breathed out warm air.

Despite how bright my light was. The darkness of the hallway seemed to swallow the beam itself. I continued forward as I passed flickering neon signs that illuminated the floating dust particles kicked up by my boots. 

I passed the hallway into the main atrium. The main skylight acted like a beacon of brightness in rest of the lightless mall. A maze of escalators and stairs twisted around the multistory atrium. It was almost beautiful in a way.. How calm and quiet everything was now. The crowds that strangled every inch of this place either fled like roaches into the rehabitation camps or became one of the wandering shells. Not it was just us and those who don’t belong here.

I was snapped out of my thoughts as I heard the distinct sound of a phone ringing. I looked over to see several worn pay phones lined up against the nearby balcony. The ringing reverberated the empty halls as I hesitated to answer it.

‘Scepter? What's wrong?”

Nest asked with a twinge of concern in her voice.

“Got uh…a audio irregularity here nest”

I said attempting to regain my radio etiquette. Despite my hesitation to answer it, it was still ringing. It should have stopped ringing by now.

“The phone?” She asked with a hint of hesitation.

“Yeah its still ringing”. I stated slightly unnerved by the constant ringing

“Go ahead and answer it. Don’t say anything unless its necessary. I’ll listen in”.

I sighed into the mic before replying to her

“Copy”

I approached the still ringing phone. I shines my flashlight on the box itself. It had a deep layer of dust covering its exterior. I noticed alot of the wiring were completely exposed with the insulation of the wiring almost completely stripped from the cables. Parts of it looked to be snapped off completely from being chewed on by rats.

“Nest, I don’t think the wiring is even intact enough for it to even work. This place part of the blackout zone?”

“I can see from here it's not. As for power, it's in blackout zone five last I checked. Could be a backup generator that's still running. Look into it after you answer it.”

“Got it”

I said as I picked up the receiver and put it to where my ears would be under the chemical hood. I heard slight static from the other side as I quietly listened for any sound I could pick up.

I could hear someone else listening on the other end just like I was. I considered saying something as the silence only began to sink in further but decided against it. Instead I slowly tapped the receiver a few times with my clunky chemical gloves. 

I knew whatever was on the other side heard it when what I can only describe as a sharp inhale, from something that had greater lung capacity than a human. I heard a voice straining itself like it was trying to speak for the first time. The line went back to muted static again. I kept listening for a few more moments and I could now hear what sounded like the usual kind of music you hear when you get put on hold.

Something about it was wrong at your first listen; it might sound like a normal song. Something you might hear in a mall or an elevator. Maybe some old department store. Unassuming, unremarkable.

The notes that played I quickly took note that some of them were out of tune, some didn’t even sound like they were played correctly. Like it was a song based on someone else’s memory alone.

I looked down at the receiver, staring at the weather worn phone. Still emitting that strange music. I hesitated to hang up yet. Especially since nest was still listening.

“Hang up.” Said nest with a more harsh edge to her voice.

I quietly set the phone back in its place, finally silencing it. I grabbed my handset for my radio. I held down the button to say something but any words I could say refused to leave my mouth. I let the button go as I released my gloved finger.

I started walking again, this time with my free hand on my holster. I suppressed the sound of my heavy winter boots as I best I could while also avoiding stepping on any shards of glass or loose paper. I could tell nest was watching the feed closely.

“Got a floorplan for this place?”

I asked her quietly

“Standby” she said with added professionalism.

I sighed softly and silently wished I was somewhere else. I took out one of my disposable cameras and snapped a few quick photos of my surroundings. Including that strange pay phone. Eventually I heard nest back on the net.

“From what I can there’s a series of maintenance tunnels that lead to some kind of…utility room? Seems large enough to house a generator.”

I softly tapped my rubberized boot for a moment in thought.

“If it was running all this time it should have been out of juice by now”.

Nest was silent for a few moments but I couldn’t tell her finger was on the receiver from the slight static through my hand mic.

“Look into it please, you should be able to get into maints through one of the storefronts.” She replied after a slight pause.

“Got it”. I replied as I shined my light into one of the storefronts.

I got a closer look through the amber beam of my flashlight. Most of the arcade cabinets were still inside. The colorful fonts and vibrant artwork sprawled across the peeling plastic stared indifferently at my form as I gazed inside. The way in was half covered by metal bars. I kneeled down to get a better look inside. Honestly it was in better shape than most of the storefronts in comparison. It seemed like the looters didn’t see much point in ransacking this place, that might not be a good sign.

I crouched in careful not to strike the barred food with any of my gear or my alice pack. The air inside still carried a deathly frigidity to it. Despite being sheltered from much of the wind’s wrath. Even with all of the insulated MOPP gear on, the cold didn’t relent.

I stood up and looked around my weathered surroundings, my footsteps softened on the faded starlike carpet. The beam from my light source reflected off the arcade machine’s screens. Some of them were cracked or had a thin layer of frost covering them. I passed the once colorful prize corner, its cheaply made winnings were still stocked, hardly even touched. As splotchy and worn they were. Not even the looters wanted that shit. I peered around the arcade looking for my way into the tunnels. I finally sighted a set of double industrial doors just past the two racing game machines. The pho double racing seats jutted out from the ultra wide screen of the machine. I passed by the barely legible titles of Dayton USA and Sega Rally as I got closer to the door.

I glanced up at the lightless exit sign that hung above the doorway. My hand grasped the handle and turned it quietly only to find it locked. I took a step back and sent a swift kick into the door. The rusted hinges didn’t offer much resistance as the door flew open to a door hallway. I peeked my head around the corner as the light illuminated clinical white walls, various piping and exposed cables jutted out from the walls. The hallway was silent with even the sound of howling wind not reaching this place.

I trudged forward not exactly eager to continue on, but I resigned myself to do so. Then finally somewhere deep within the darkness beside my vision, I could hear something stirring in the lightless corridor, music, just music. This time it was different from how I heard it on the phone. Loud and clear, no longer strangled by the static of the payphone’s receiver. 

The tone was melodic, probably an older song, with lots of classical instruments. It was soothing almost unnaturally so. Like a lullaby from your childhood, it almost sounded familiar to me. Like something that lingered in the back of my mind, despite how many years had passed. Where have I heard this before?

I switched off the flashlight and stowed it on my webbing. I groped for my dimmer headlamp and turned it on. I unslung the shotgun from over my shoulder and half pumped it to check for the shell’s presence in the chamber.

“Please be careful” I heard nest say with a hint of nervousness in her voice.

I looked down at my handset as she made this remark. She was right. I did need to be careful. I was alone, no one was there to watch my back. No one was there to patch me up or carry me out if I couldn’t make my own way out. If I went down no one was here to carry me to safety. Something could easily leap from the darkness and slit my throat before I even had the chance to fire off a single shell. If I had to run in this heavy gear would I even make it? Even if I dropped my pack. I would drop my only lifeline to the outside world with it. I tightened my grip on my shotgun to keep my hands from shaking.

I took a deep breath as the music echoed in some distant corner of the tunnel. I started carefully moving down the hallway. I held my shotgun close to me, the music only grew louder as I walked deeper into the shadows for what seemed like an eternity.

“Switching to open mic.” I said softly into my radio as I set it to hot mic my every word, I needed my hands free for what came next.  Nest didn’t reply this time.

The hallway finally led to an open doorway. Which proceeded a middling room that seemed to some kind of storage or utility room. Something made me stop dead in my tracks. Two dead bodies lay on the cracked concrete floor in newly made winter clothes. I raised my shotgun as I creeped past the threshold of the doorway. I quickly scanned the room for any kind of threats. I checked my corners. Double checked the doorway behind me to ensure I wasn’t followed here. I did everything by the book. I couldn’t find anything inside minus the bodies.

The utility room seemed to originally house some shelving and circuit breakers but now it seemed to be converted into some kind of makeshift sleeping area of sorts. Two winter sleeping bags were laid out as well as some various other amenities. A kerosene stove, a cooler, and some burnt out flashlights. The floor was covered in torn open bright yellow packaging from handed out HDRs, patriotically colored foil wrappers, stamped on cardboard food packets with half torn American flags and a small bold text that read:

‘food gift from the people of the united states of america.’

‘Nest got two bodies here, look to be vagrants. Gonna look them over.”

“Heard”

I kneeled down beside the first corpse. They were dressed in soaked winter clothes, scarves and all. They were laying face down. I grabbed their shoulders and turned them over. The pale lifeless face of a man in his mid thirties with his eyes wide open stared back at me. The warmth had been completely sapped from his body by the cold air, must have been dead for at least ten hours but it could have been longer. 

I started to cut open the clothes with a pair of trauma shears from my belt to see if I could get a better look at any wounds that could have killed him. I noted quickly I didn’t see any kind of wounds or massive trauma that could have did him in, hell I didn’t even see a single drop of blood on him. If I hadn’t known any better I would have said the cold took him.

The other corpse was in the same state. Ice cold, pale, no wounds, no blood, nothing. The clothes they were wearing should have protected them plenty from hypothermia or frostbite. Even if their clothes got wet. It was almost like they just gave up on living all together. 

I snapped a few pictures of the bodies and the room itself. Nest was still quiet.

“Nest these bodies-” She interrupted me.

“I know just take some samples and-”

Something finally dawned on me, the music had gotten much louder now. Nest had noticed it too. I stood up to stare at where the music was coming from. I waited for it to draw closer beyond the closed doors but it never did.

I slowly approached the door with my shotgun at the ready. I swung the door open only to see utter darkness staring back at me. I shined my headlamp into the darkness, the shadows seemed to swallow the beam from my light. This wasn’t any natural darkness. The music itself seemed to be coming from the shadows themselves, despite the pitch blackness, I could see what seemed to be particles of dust and snow swaying in the air within the symphony. Waves of heat vibrated in the air in that supernatural darkness.

I never thought I would ever get close to one of these. I felt gusts of hot and cold air brush past me. It was mesmerizing honestly, I felt myself go into a small trance, it seemed like I found the source of the strange activity.

“Nest got a positive ID on a musician here”.

“I can see that…what's it doing?”

She inquired as the peaceful music continued to play and echo in the halls. I observed it for a moment before finally replying.

“Its humming”. I replied as I lowered my shotgun.

“Did it kill those two?”

Nest asked me softly.

I looked back over at the two unmoving bodies then back at the musician, gazing at it for a second.

“Unlikely, I don’t see any burns on them.”

As I said this I could hear something different. The fluorescent overhead light tubes began to softly buzz above me. I was sure the power was completely dead besides that phone. My doubts began to fester as they began to flicker on and off.

I felt a pit forming in my stomach as the lights continued to act up. Even the burnt out flashlights nearby began to flicker to life. Nothing about this was right, nothing about this made any sense. I needed to leave and fast.

“N-nest permission to-”

I stopped myself mid sentence. There was another sound. I waited, I listened. I heard it, somewhere close by but I couldn’t tell where. The sound of scrapping metal began to draw near. It almost sounded like it was coming from all around, every angle, every corner. I prepared myself for the task ahead, fighting for my survival. I kept turning and turning trying to point the barrel of my weapon at the source of this sound. 

“Scepter? What's wrong? What do you hear?” She asked with dread seeping into her usually calming voice. I debated telling her that I was cutting the job short and ditching it, but it was probably too late now. 

“Hold traffic”. I said as I curled my finger around the trigger, I waited for anything to move to make itself a target. But it only got quieter, even the musician’s ever present melody fell silent. The only sound I could hear now was the buzzing from the lights above me.

I continued to look around my surroundings. My heart started to beat faster like it was about to burst out of my chest at any moment. I felt sweat begin to build up under my stuffy MOPP suit.

I froze in place, there was only one place I hadn’t checked. Right above me. The musician suddenly blared out a series of notes much louder than before. The walls seemed to vibrate from the volume, it was much different from the song it was humming a few moments ago.

This song was fast paced, suspenseful like something you might hear in a good horror movie. I realized something at that moment, it was warning me. I didn’t have a chance to wonder why as I looked up

What I saw hanging from the ceiling was something I could hardly put into words. Where would I even start with describing what I saw?

My eyes burned when I looked at it, tears began to overtake my vision. The lenses on my gas mask began to fog up.

I could hear my radio crackling with some kind of interference. My trigger felt like it weighed fifty pounds. It was reaching out to me but I quickly noticed it didn’t have any hands. What I remember the most was its misshapen smile or maybe it was a sneer. I couldn’t tell. I finally squeezed the trigger.

I was quickly glad I chose buckshot this time otherwise I probably would have missed. I slam fired two shells into it. I know I hit it but it didn’t stop it. I was confident that it took off an arm if you could call it that. But it did give me just enough time to bolt for the door.

“Class five! Class five!” I yelled into the radio as my hand grasped the doorknob. I swung the door open and slammed it shut behind me

My heavy boots stomped loudly as I took off in a dead sprint down the never ending hallway. I could hardly see where I was going out of the foggy lenses.

“Get the fuck out of there locke!”

I could hear nest scream through the crackling interference of my radio.

That's when I heard those god awful sounds coming from behind me. The door behind bulged as it slammed into it with its endless body. The door began to bend and twist as its writhing appendages reached through the jagged gaps in the door. The sounds it made, like nothing I had ever heard in all my years of being a collector. A deep rumbling murmur shook my surroundings. The sound traveled through my body as this hum only increased in volume. The lights flicked rapidly as they were reanimated. My breathing only increased in rhythm as I reached the double doors back to the arcade. I could hear the sound of the door behind finally giving away as it flew off its hinges and slammed into the ground.

I shoulder checked the next door open, quickly shutting it behind me, thats when I noticed the arcade began to flicker alight. It wasn’t just the lights this time, it was the arcade machines too.

The dusty screens and debris-ridden speakers began to reanimate. Light filled the forgotten arcade, slow and sputtering at first, like something waking up that shouldn’t. Colored bulbs cracked to life one by one, blinking and stuttering like fireflies drowning in static. The machines, long-dead and dust-caked, flickered to their attract modes. Glitched gameplay previews stuttered across the screens, voices warbled through shredded speakers.

One cabinet, deep in the row behind me, let out a warped shriek.

“DAY… TONAAAAA—AA!”

It was blown out, distorted, far too loud for such a hollow space. The sound hit my chest like a shockwave—cheerful, enthusiastic, completely wrong. It echoed through the arcade like something remembering how to be alive, even if it didn’t understand why.

Even through the flashing lights and mechanical noise, I heard it: the door creaking open. The one I knew I had locked.

It slithered. It crawled. It walked—all at once, but never made a sound when it moved. I ducked low behind a row of jammed cabinets, trying not to breathe too loud. My gear felt like dead weight now.

I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible even with the adrenaline pumping into my veins. I was hardly able to stand up with how much my legs were shaking.

Even though it didn’t make a sound when it moved. I could still hear a very muffled creak from the floor itself from its mass. It whirred and warbled; it almost sounded like it was mechanical in nature instead of coming from a living thing.

The doorway was close but not close enough for me to make a mad dash for it without it catching up to me before I could crawl back under the barred door.

I slowly reached on my belt for something I had been saving for a rainy day just like this, an incendiary grenade. It felt like it took a lifetime for me to unhook it from my webbing without alerting it to my presence. 

I let my shotgun hang from the sling across my chest as I took off the various safety pins on the grenade. I slowly peeked through a gap between two machines. I could see its massive form almost covering the entire gap. I slowly pied the corner with my finger on the pin of the grenade, ready to pull at any time. I peeked my head around the corner. It wasn’t facing me this time. It was completely still, listening for the smallest sounds.

I twisted and pulled the pin with considerable force. I knew it heard it because it stopped making those god awful sounds. My arms felt heavy as lead. I fought my shaking hands to keep my thumb on the clip to keep it from going off in my hand.

It turned to look at me with that smile that was too wide, too misshapen. That's when I realized, it wasn’t smiling. It just didn’t have any lips for its spiraling maw. Its many eyes stared right into me.

Every single cell of my body screamed at me to run, to hide. I grit my teeth and finally tossed the grenade.

I didn’t know if the live feed was still active, I hoped it was but I know this must have been hard for her to watch but at least she had the common sense to stay quiet while this thing was after me. I felt tempted to turn off the live feed so she didn’t have to watch me get ripped apart by this thing. What little chances I had, lay in that cylinder of thermite. 

The grenade landed right next to it. It glanced over at it with its many independently blinking eyes. That's when it finally went off, first thing I saw was the smoke then the grenade hissing harshly as it released a cone of sparks. The mold covered carpet was the first thing to catch aflame.

I expected to hear it screeching, screaming. Anything but it was silent. Normally alot of these things scream when fire touches them. They hate it more than anything else.

I took my chance and dashed for the doorway as the smoke began to fill the room. I reached the barred door and practically threw my body through the gap. I slammed it shut and made sure it couldn’t be opened this time. My breathing was ragged as I laid on the floor covered in sweat. Smoke had finally claimed the majority of the room, obscuring my view of its interior.

I was about to push myself back up and continue running but something stopped me. An orange glow could be seen through the thick smoke. That's when I saw it, it was still alive. It emerged from the smoke. Its entire form engulfed in flames. That's when I realized how tall it really was. It stooped down to gaze at me. The flames didn’t seem to bother it as its flesh began to char.

I aimed my shotgun at it with my unsteady hands as it continued to stare at me from its side of the barred door. Its lipless maw began to move like it was trying to speak. I was glued to the spot as I could only stare at it with wide eyes as they stinged from looking at it.

Its appendages wrapped themselves around the bar, still staring down at me. I felt thoughts that weren’t my own enter my mind. A single word kept repeating itself over and over again from a voice I never heard in my life.

“Reanimator” It continued to echo in the confines of my skull.

Finally my radio screamed to life once again and I heard nest’s calming voice over the net. She only said one word.

“Run”

This seemed to snap me out of my trance. I pushed myself to my feet and took off down the hallway. The lights around me were flashing wildly as my legs burned from all the gear I was running with. I rounded the corner, entering the main atrium again.

I came to a screeching halt at what I saw next. Everything was back to normal, all the decay, all the disrepair. It was gone. The lights were back, the biting cold air had vanished entirely. The mall wasn’t just repaired, it was alive again. There were people. There were families and groups of teenagers meeting up at the food court after school. All walking by at a leisurely pace for a slow afternoon of shopping, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

The people looked normal enough at first. Nirvana shirts, jeans, the newest kicks. All wearing bright summer wear but I couldn’t see any of their faces. They weren’t missing them entirely, they were fuzzy like trying to take a picture of someone’s face when the camera was out of focus.

They didn’t even seem to notice I was there. Some of them even walked right through me like I was a hologram. I was lost, lost in more ways than I could possibly imagine. I reached for my radio in vain hope that I could still reach nest.

“Nest…can you hear me?”

I desperately wished to hear nest’s nonchalant voice over the net. I could only hear static from the other end, I was truly alone in this mall of ghosts.

The various shop fronts were stocked again. The windows were pristine and undamaged. I could see the out of focus people lazily walking back and forth between the aisles like it was just another day for them. Some of them occupied the colorful seating of the food court and gestured to each other like they were having casual conversations, but the only sounds I could hear from the were indistinct mumblings and murmurs of echoes of human voices. 

Sometimes I missed those days, I missed feeling safe. I missed coming back home to her smiling face. I missed the simple monotony of a nine to five. Hell I even missed those annoying ass jingles they played for ads on daytime TV. I missed it all. I began to wonder if this is where I would spend the rest of my days, wandering in this endless mall. Unseen, unnoticed. Bound to this mockery of normal life.

I trapsed forward not sure where to go at this point besides the exit I came from. I passed the now pristine pay phones. One of them began to ring suddenly. I immediately stopped where I was. 

I sighed softly and slowly walked towards the still ringing phone. That's when I felt a warm hand grasping my shoulder. I turned sharply, bringing my shotgun to bear. Staring back at me was a young woman in her mid twenties. Her face was different from the others, her face was in focus, she had delicate features. Jet black hair with long bangs. She had unnaturally pale eyes.

“You shouldn’t answer that”.

She said in a soft yet firm tone. I ripped free from her gip and backed away from her still aiming my shotgun at her.

“Why not?” I asked in a flat tone.

“You don’t want to know what it will tell you”.

I lowered my shotgun slightly

“It?” I asked not liking where this was going.

“The reanimator”

I was silent for a moment debating on what I should even do at this point.

“Who are you?” I asked warily

She crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly as she regarded me.

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you”

I opened my mouth to ask her another question but she cut me off.

“No more questions Locke, you need to leave this place.”

“How?” I asked with hesitation, unnerved she knew my name. I know she probably wouldn’t tell me how she knew.

“Same way you came in. you don’t have much time. It's coming. You want to see Lorraine again don’t you?”

My eyes widened as I was stunned into silence. I finally mustered up some words to respond to her. 

“Y..yes”

“Then go” She said with a wave of her hand.

The last thing I saw her do was wink at me before she turned and walked a few steps away from me and her form faded entirely from my vision. 

Then I heard that horrifying yet familiar humming, it was close. I knew I couldn’t hide from it. Fighting it was a losing battle. All I could do was run and pray for my survival. That's exactly what I did at that moment. I ran like I never ran before in my entire life.

The humming was getting closer even as I increased my speed. I finally saw my way out, the doors I took to get inside the mall, now a pristine set of sliding glass doors.

Outside I could see a familiar sight. Snow covered streets, the wreckages of cars, the frozen corpses. I slammed the doors open as I barreled myself outside using the last vestiges of my energy and will to live.

I panted as I continued sprinting into the knee deep snow not caring about the gear getting covered in snow. My radio began to squawk at me as I heard nest’s worried voice over comms.

“Scepter! Scepter come in!”

“I’m here!” I could hear nest sigh in relief from the other end.

“Thank fuck! Your feed cut and I couldn’t reach you.”

I took a deep breath in and out.

“I’m okay…I’m- sorry” I said in between breaths

“No shut up, just…get back safe”

I turned look back at the mall once again, it was in disrepair, ruined, worn down. The neon sign above the doorway that read ‘grover mall’ began to flicker. I cursed under my breath and raised my shotgun to my shoulder.

I saw its body coil itself by the doorway. Its infinite eyes stared back at me as I backed away from the mall. It observed me for a second before it suddenly recessed its measureless form back within the confines of the mall. I don’t know why it didn’t come after me. Nest made one last transmission for awhile

“Okay…the money will be in a dead drop. Pick up is ten minutes away. Nest out.”

I sighed and turned away from that awful place and walked down the treacherous road to await pick up. I always tried to avoid that place when taking contracts. I wish I could say I never did collector work again but I was in no place to quit. I went back to that church. Smoked a couple cigs, stared into the embers of the pastor’s fire and went out to do it all over again, the next day but I never went back to blackout zone five.",1,1767572846.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend, Leila, and I were on a late-night snack run at a nearby convenience store. It was date night, and we had tickets to a screening of *Apocalypto*, which we were on the verge of missing. She was perusing the front counter’s selection of soft and hard Ice creams, and I was keeping an eye out for something coffee or mocha-flavored. I heard the front door's entry tone sound off, signaling that another customer had walked in. I didn’t pay it any mind, but when I had stepped to the side, I could see the reflection of a man in a black jacket with a grey hoodie up, a red paisley bandana high up on his face. I turned to get a better look, and I could see him pulling his hand out of his pocket. Instinct told me that meant trouble, street smarts told me I was correct. 

Reflecting on it, everything that happened in those eight minutes seemed to transpire in slow motion. I watched his brow furrow with a meanness that I had only seen on fighters in a ring. I watched his hand remove a compact black pistol from the pocket of his black jean jacket. I remember in vivid detail the brass-colored etching on the blued slide of the pistol: MILLENIUM. I remember how muffled his commands to the store clerk sounded with his lips pressed against the bandana that covered his face. I remember my hand slowly reaching for her hand and slowly turning to her with panic in my voice to tell her we would be okay. I still remember the details of her face from that moment: her hazel eyes, seemingly vibrating in place, her olive-toned face, her brow now beginning to glisten from a cold sweat, her lower lip starting to quiver. “Leila,” I thought,

 I remember seeing the robber in my peripheral vision as he transitioned his attention towards me. I remember the exact sensation of the 40 caliber bullet piercing the right side of my face.

When you get shot in the face, you don’t feel the immediate pain from the bullet's impact. My first sensation was whiplash, as if I was riding in the passenger side of a car and was just t-boned. The second sensation I felt was my skull rattling viciously while a hot chunk of lead simultaneously pulverised the bones in my face. I could feel the cheekbone shatter, my sinus and nasal cavity expel all air, and immediately take in hot blood. The sensation was comparable to breathing in water through your nose in a heavily chlorinated swimming pool if the water had just been freshly boiled. I could feel a few of my teeth getting turned to a fine powder. Within the rattling of my skull, the sound, aside from the ringing, courtesy of my now shattered ear bone, was very similar to a time when I once smashed a marble with a claw hammer. Equally similar was how I could both feel and hear the glass shards getting dragged across the concrete floor of my garage through the vibrations being telegraphed into the handle of the hammer. I could feel a hot, wet feeling in the rear palate of my throat as the wound cavity began to expand and break through the roof of my mouth. I could feel my cheek immediately begin to swell up, and my right eye, which now began to turn red from the internal bleeding, began to close. I could feel it forcibly tear up, a sensation that was isolated to that one eye, like someone had an industrial fan focused on it alone. It made it hard to keep both eyes open and trained on her as I fell in place on that scuffed, tile flooring of that corner store.

As I fell to the floor, she reached for both of my hands, trying to slowly guide my now limp body to the ground. I fell hard anyway, I was much heavier than she was prepared for. I could feel her leaning over my body, her elbows resting on my chest as she violently sobbed over me. I could feel her bloodied fist pressing into my sternum. She tried to take my hand into hers and clutched it close to her face as she continued to cry over me, her tears and my blood soaking the collar of my shirt. As she continued to weep into my chest, my vision faded. The fluorescent lights appeared brighter, with the light streaks becoming more aggressive against the darkness that slowly surrounded the fixtures. Once the darkness overtook my field of view. I remember thinking, “So this is it, this is what death is like.”

My last sensation alive was a sudden feeling of dead weight dropping onto my chest. Everything was pitch black, and I felt like I was floating in nothingness. Like I had yet to resurface out of a dark pool. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t hear anything, the smell of blood and lead that had filled my nose was now totally absent. I couldn’t even gauge what the temperature was. I was experiencing total sensory deprivation. I began to lose my grasp on time. It felt like I was there for only a minute, but it could've just as easily been thirty.  I entered a state of mind similar to daydreaming, where I was not actively taking in my surroundings but getting lost in thought. The problem was I had no thought; If I were to attempt to remember something familiar, no image would manifest in my mind's eye. It was just black. It was just emptiness. While I waded in this void, I was interrupted by whispers. 

At first, I thought I was imagining things, but that was impossible as my imagination was currently on hiatus. They were faint, but I was definitely hearing them, the whispers. They were too far out, or perhaps too quiet to hear clearly, but the volume gradually increased, and the words became more intelligible. It was definitely not English, but it didn’t sound like any language I recognised either. Maybe some kind of dialect from the Middle East. The whispers continued to get louder and louder. It was to a point where I could almost pinpoint where the whispers were emanating from in my vicinity, like when you can feel someone is near you. Like the force generated when you try to push two magnets with the same polarity to touch. I could feel that I was surrounded, and the whispers only grew louder. I could now distinguish that they were all chanting the same repetitive phrase, but not all in the same language. I could recognize what might have been Arabic, and maybe…Hebrew? The whispers grew incessantly loud and hissing, but it was now to a point where the source of the whispers was so close to me that I could feel the moisture of one's breath impacting my ears. Whatever was whispering was forcing itself closer and closer into my head. The whispering was now coming from within my own head and had turned to shouting. It caused pressure in my head so painful that I pressed my hands to my ears to block out the sound, which was quickly turning into a tinnitus-like ringing that was getting too loud to drown out.

Then all of a sudden, nothing? I opened my eyes and slowly dropped my hands from my ears. From a distant corner of the darkness, there was a dim light. From out of the pure darkness, I saw a mere pinprick of light, and I went towards it. 

“A light at the end of a tunnel,” I muttered to myself. The closer I got to it, the more intense the light was. I partly shielded my eyes as I got closer, the light now becoming disorientingly bright in its brilliance. My vision was consumed by it to the point where it was just too intense to keep my eyes open, yet I pressed on. I stopped, and I felt something cold and hard on my back. Cold. Could I feel the cold? I could feel the temperature. I could feel where my head, back, and legs made contact with this cold surface. I started to regain my other senses. I smelled blood, lead, Coffee, and something else. Something exceptionally sweet. I began to squint my eyes, slowly opening them to avoid my retinas getting burned out. But it wasn’t as bright or as brilliant as before. I slowly opened my eyes more. It was fluorescent lights. I was lying on the floor of the convenience store. 

All at once, all the pain came rushing back into me; my neck, head, and face were sore. There was a stinging sensation caused by the draft making contact with the wound on my face. I could hear a sound coming from behind me, but the act of turning my head was gonna take some getting used to in my condition. The pain I was feeling was excruciating, yet I turned my head side to side so I could check my immediate surroundings. I could still hear that same sound of something rustling around, and someone breathing heavy. Slowly, I stood up. It was laborious, but I managed to stumble up, like I was waking up from a coma, and my whole body was atrophied. I looked around, taking in my surroundings. Almost immediately, I saw the same man I described before, quickly packing cartons and individual packs of cigarettes and cans of tobacco into a drawstring backpack. 

For a moment, I was distracted by my reflection in the countertop’s sneeze shield. My cheeks, blackened by the aggressive swelling, were deformed and misshapen. I pondered how I was even standing. I had heard of soldiers surviving gunshot wounds to the face, but to see my own face in such a condition was surreal. My thoughts were interrupted,

“ What the fuck, I shot you in the face?” I looked up, and the thief was pointing his pistol at me. He slowly moved back to the front of the counter with his haul, keeping his gun trained on my chest. I raised my hands. I spoke in pain, my words expressed with a mild lisp,

“Let’s just take it easy, man, I’m good, nobody’s hurt, I’ll go to a hospital, you can leave.”

    I could see his expression ease up for a second. As if he were considering running. With my hands up, I bowed my head slightly, prepared for whatever outcome. That’s when I saw her; Her limp body lay on the dirty tiled floor in a pool of blood. She had two gunshot wounds in her back. She held my body in anguish, and he shot her dead. I looked up at him with fury in my eyes.

“ You son of a..” CRACK! He fired his pistol into my abdomen. I hinged at the waist, my ears ringing as I put my hand over my gut. I looked at my hand, and the blood was darker than I expected, blacker. I rushed him, and he fired two more shots. The second hit me near the first, and the third hit me higher up near my sternum. I barely felt any pain. I tackled him to the ground, and I punched him twice in the side of the face.  He fired another shot into my shoulder, and I grabbed his wrist with my left hand to keep him from getting another shot off. CRACK! He fired another shot, barely missing my left ear. The slide locked back, indicating an empty chamber. As my ears rang, I wrestled the empty pistol out of his hand. He tried to fight me off, but I was stronger. I punched him in his nose, and I could feel it crunch under my fist. I punched him again and dove for his pistol, with both arms pinned him down with my body weight. 

    I got his pistol free, I took it in my right hand, and beat his temple with the butt of his gun. I hit him again and again. I felt less resistance with each strike. He raised his hand weakly to plead for me to stop. I didn’t. I sat up, straddling his torso, alternating blows to his head. THUD…My left fist strikes his head. THUMP…My right fist, clutching the pistol, strikes the other side of his head. He stopped moving, the blood bubbles stopped coming out of his nose and mouth, and I kept throwing powerful punches. With each blow, my face was misted with his blood. I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my head. I breathed heavy, as any boxer will tell you, throwing jabs will tire you out. 

I lowered my gaze to the now pulverised man's face. I looked at my bloodied hands. I trembled, now feeling the full wave of pain in my various gunshot wounds. As my heart beat, and I breathed heavily, I began to smell something, something…sweet? I looked back at the sorry son of a bitch I had just beaten to death. My heart began to speed up, and I could now hear the percussive rhythm crescendoing within my own ears, and the smell grew sweeter and sweeter. Like a cart of fresh pastries was wheeled in, and every odorant was activated all at once. My vision pulsated, all my senses were being overwhelmed, and I let instinct take the wheel. I knelt and, with an outstretched maw, I dove down and took an aggressive bite out of the thief's neck. All logic and reason went out the window. I didn’t second-guess myself; this felt…natural? 

As I bit down harder and harder, the first chunk of skin and artery finally broke. Warm blood oozed from the edges of my mouth as my teeth sank deeper and deeper into his neck. The effort I gave to pull a mouthful of flesh from the man's neck was more labor-intensive than I thought it would be. It felt tough to chew, like an undercooked steak. But in the same vein, the flavor was just as savory. 

As I swallowed, I could feel the still-warm blood travel down my throat. I took another bite, and as I chewed, I looked at my reflection in the convex mirror. The bullet hole in my face had closed up. I lifted my shirt and looked at my stomach. That bullet hole was actively closing before my eyes. 

“That’s freaky,” I exclaimed. 

I took another bite from the meat on his chest. The skin was tougher to break, and I had to work much harder to pull it away. The muscle fibers tore from his rib cage. I felt the grinding on my teeth as I bit along his collarbone in an attempt to get more purchase. I took a large chunk in my hand and ripped off smaller, more digestible chunks with my teeth. As I gnawed on the flesh, I looked over at Leila’s body. I swallowed, then crawled over to her. 

    I tried to turn her body over as tenderly as I could. She felt so fragile in my arms. I sat down next to her body and pulled her onto my lap. Already, she was so cold and clammy. I took her hand into mine, and I felt like I was gonna break her arm. I stroked her hair, and my eyes began to well. I turned her over so I could look at her. There was no color in her face, and her eyes were wide open and pale. I closed her eyes for her. My lip quivered as I could feel the tears travel down my formerly deformed face. I hugged her tightly and held her hand tighter. 
    
    I felt something in her hand. I unclenched her grip; she had a pendant in her hand that I had seen her wear before. It was a small lightbulb-shaped pendant, now broken, with a piece of crystal piercing her palm. I took the pendant from her and tried to pull the shards from her hand. I pulled the largest piece out of a fold of ski. Even though she was dead, I still tried to be gentle. When the piece finally broke free, I got a fresh whiff of the scent of her blood. She smelled sweeter and more savory. My heart began to beat more intently again. The smell of her blood became more pungent and more alluring. I felt sick and disgusted that I was even thinking about that. I felt like I was gonna puke, but the smell was still so inviting. I moved her hair to the side, exposing her neck, and lifted her body to my mouth. Her head was limply dangling in an undignified fashion. 

As I was preparing to bite into her neck, I saw flashing lights in my peripheral vision. Red and blue lights. I came back to my senses and looked up. Two officers were cautiously approaching the entrance. When they finally saw me, both officers drew their service pistols and entered the store with a sense of purpose. The older-looking officer approached me with his pistol at the low-read, and ordered,

“Sir, lie down on the ground and put your hands on your head!”

I held Leila’s hand in mine, fumbling with the pendant in my other hand, and looked up at the office, as he was preparing to repeat the same order.

“ Call an ambulance,” I muttered. As I collapsed onto the ground. As I lay there, I could faintly hear the second officer call on his radio.

“Dispatch, we need a bus at the 10-65. One Caucasian male, mid-twenties, with multiple gunshot wounds. Additionally, two 10-54, one female, mid twenties. Break. One male. Can’t ID, how copy? Over.” 

The officer's radio squelched, and I heard the dispatcher respond. I heard the Officer approach the body of the robber.

“What the hell happened to you?” 

I could feel my heart rate begin to slow down, and my vision started to become blurred. As I faded to black, I took one last look at Leila and the broken bulb pendant in my hand. Drifting out of consciousness, I could hear the whispering again, once again starting faint and gradually getting louder. The unintelligible, repetitive speech in different languages. 

Looking back, I wonder how I didn’t hear it to begin with; everything translates to the same thing. The commonality between them all. It all comes back to the same root phrase:

*“Thou cannot die, which is already dead.”*

For the first month it worked perfectly. But recently, it has started struggling to pull shots. 

Here's what I've tried to rectify the situation:

1. Adjust grind size and ran the machine- barely any drops of coffee came out and when I opened the portafilter coffee sprayed out everywhere
2. Ran the machine without a portafilter- the water flowed
3. Ran the machine with an empty basket- some water remained in the basket after the machine was done pulling the shot
4. Cleaned the basket and portafilter and tried #3 again- still water in the basket
5. Bought a new portafilter and basket and tried #3 again- still water in the basket

At this point I'm sure the grind size is not the issue and the baskets are not clogged either. 

I'm very new to coffee so this is quite puzzling and disappointing for me. If anyone has ideas on how to troubleshoot, I'd really appreciate the guidance. ",0,1767572507.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

\- free room upgrade to a high level floor with a view of the Empire State building

\- $100 property credit. Was told that this could only be used at the rooftop bar or the hotel restaurant. Not valid on room service or spa. Ended up spending this on a couple of drinks at the rooftop bar.

\- welcome gift = sleeve of macarons 

\- free breakfast for 2 which we did not use. When we got there, it was about a 15 min wait to get seated. You get an option of 1 entree, drip coffee, and something else. 

\- minus 1 star since I found lots of small flies sitting in the shower 

\- late check out. Given that I called 20 mins before the standard 12pm check out time, they were able to let me check out at 12:30pm. But was told that we could check out at 2pm (subject to availability- maybe if you call earlier you can check out later?).

1q46fov,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q46fov/ending_our_8_year_relationship/,Ending our 8 year relationship,"So my partner and I have been together for almost 8 years.

The last 5 was the toughest for me. I wanted to leave but I stuck around because I love him and mostly for my 3 year old son and my 2 stepdaughters and my older son from my previous relationship.

Ok so I love my stepdaughters I met them at 2 and 6. They are majority with me more than their own parents since I work from home. Esp during Covid they stay with us primary since day care was closed and their mom also have work.

My daughters and I are very close. Esp my oldest daughter (14). This summer that just passed she got lazy and she was 13 at that time. She complains a lot and just move very slow. And she cried to her dad I guess she said that I make her do too much around the house? I make her siblings do the same or more than she does because she moves slow and also she has more homework than them during school year. 

So she went crying to her dad etc saying I don’t understand and don’t take ownership of the things I say to do. That I make fun of her etc. I admit we do make fun but it’s mostly jokes and she does it to all of us. Like she make fun of how I pronounce things because I cannot say things clearly but I speak two languages. 

Anywho I was fine I cried I apologize that I made her feel that way but I was annoyed that my partner just sided with her 100%. Like oh I know how you feel she does that to me. Or she doesn’t understand people like us we need time to digest or wake up to wake up. Whatever.

So he asked me to ask her to do less. We are a family of 6 and I cook and clean a lot so my kids help out and my partner does help out with dishes. Trash and lawn care. The kids are primarily my responsibility. The girls mom are also in the pic and usually communicates with me since I am their primary care.

I got mad at him for not taking my side for not defending me when she talked about me the way she did. I was over it. I was fine. After I talk to her even though I was upset. I read her messages with my niece (my best friend daughter) and she was saying that I only care about my son my golden child like I don’t care about her or her little sister (10 years old) .

I say that’s not fair and I was very upset. Their dad has a gambling addition. Stole from me and also I have paid off his debt and is still helping him. Everything the girls own I paid for it and put lines away in investment account for them. My oldest step daughter the one who is talking bad about me to her friend is the one I got Billie ellish ticket for her bday and Xmas. I paid close to $700 she did do chores and gave me $100 for it. Then for her bday I planned a trip to great wolf lodge and invited her best friend and her cousins. For my bio kid all we did was go out to dinner. He didn’t even ask for a bday present. He asked for dinner with me alone that’s it. So I did two dinners for him. One with me and one with the family.

He even mention that I spend most of my time with my oldest and pay her most attention. I say that’s because she needs it.

Anyways I got over it and we were on good terms.

So I allow her to wake up late everyday if it’s not a school day. 11-12pm. Then my partner asked me to let her wake up to wake up. Let her take her time which I do.

She moves Ridiculously slow. Example to get ready (dressed) and brush her teeth etc will take her two hours. No makeup. 

And she ends up having us wait for her too.
 I have dealt with it and was fine.

She asked to make s’mores chocolate and Dubai brownies. We just got home from 2.5 days vacation from dc so I was tired but I ran out in the cold to grab the stuff since she wanted and invited her best friend over for New Year’s Eve do bake. And her sister best friend. Her friend could not come because her brother was sick and her mom couldn’t drop her off I offer to pick her up but then the mom said no since they have a mall date Friday anyways. She said it was out of my way. So I just picked up my youngest daughter friend. When I left I made my daughter breakfast and coffee so she can wake up. And I asked her and my bio son to wash their bowl and a few extra that in the sink. And for her to put the clothes in the drier she washed last night. I came home and nothing done. I yelled her name since she was upstairs asking why she didn’t do her dishes or put her cup away. 
Her sister told me that when I called her she sigh and gave an attitude saying I just sat down. But I asked her to wash her dishes and a few others (basically the stuff we heat up from fridge and threw the container into the sink) Then she came into my bedroom crying about a spider in the basement. And she was crying etc and then during lunch she acted like she was tired and sick etc. (she did this too when I asked her to do the dishes and the laundry)

Then during lunch I called her to eat or something I forget and her dad said don’t talk to her she is overwhelm. Anyways I got into a mini argument with my partner. Then I went upstairs to check on her and I told her how I felt. (Also she didn’t wanna bake with the girls and she forced herself since I told her I went out just to grab the stuff for her! She partially participated)
Anyways I told her that if her bff was here she wouldn’t have felt sick or tired etc. and I don’t understand why she act like this. Everytime I asked her to do something it’s always something wrong. She said she is over stimulated and overwhelmed. I asked her why. I asked is it because they’re a lot of people she said yes I said it’s only one more person than usual and she said cuz of the spider and chores and my three year old crying. But I feel like when her friend is here all of this is ok. And when her friends come over I try not to ask her to do anything so they can spend time together. 

So my parnwtrr took her for a ride and she asked to go to the mall and antique store. This really made me made because I feel like she got rewarded for being lazy. She told her dad she was just overwhelm but not because of the chores and the people.x so she is telling us diff stuff. And if she is tired all day and felt sick why are they going to the mall and antique store. This is new years eye and they left us so o took the other kids to go get a treat.

And next day I talked to her again and my Partner yelled at me saying don’t yell at her or say anything to her. I said no you went on your ride and ya talked. And now it’s my turn. 

So I was gonna tell her she can’t go to the mall with her bestie and dinner the next day but I end up letting her.
I felt like my husband doesn’t understand what goes on daily because he is not involved in day to day.

He asked me to ask the kids to do less but he doesn’t offer to do more.

I’m a tired mom. I work full time and I have my kids full time and also my stepkids half the time or more. 

He got mad at me because he promised her she won’t be in trouble going on a ride and the stores. She was scared I would be mad.
I am mad because I feel like she lies to him and I know she is a kid but he doesn’t recognizes it and make me feel like the bad one.

I have taken care of these kids for almost 8 years. I bathe them, potties train them, taught them to read, take them out, buy them stuff and love them. Take them to dentist and doctors apt. Pick them up when sick In school. Set up investment account with out asking anyone. I love the girls and it makes me soo sad that he makes me feel like I don’t care about her feelings. And it’s not fair for me to spoil her more which I kind of already do. But if the other kids have chores she should have it too. She already does less. I got into a big argument with my partner and asked him to move out. I feel under appreciated and I feel like my feelings don’t matter. After all the stuff I dealt with and stay because of love and the children. I’m just tired.

All of the posts I have seen are people who either didn't like dairy before, haven't been vegan very long, or the replies say ""some people just don't like dairy"" and ignore whether the OP LIKES dairy (real or otherwise) before reintroduction.

  
I LOVED dairy and cheese all my life, then went vegan in my early twenties, and am finally caring for myself enough to reintroduce animal product into my diet.

  
Today was day two, and in the last two days I tried a couple bites of a few things. The list includes a Reese's cup, couple sips of whole milk in coffee, a croissant, some Parmesan cheese, and some queso.

  
All of it caused a strange tangy/salty taste coating my tongue, and as such I didn't really enjoy any of it. It was not BAD perse, just not great either and I wasn't itching to keep eating it. One specific thing I am dealing with at the moment is having recently been on an antibiotic which I read may interfere with taste buds?

  
Does anyone else with this specific experience (long time vegan who loved dairy and when they went back it tasted sour) have some encouraging words? Did you end up enjoying non-vegan dairy again?

I have a fiance. But I have no best friends. No regular friends I can call and just talk to or meet up with for coffee and catch up. Or have over for dinner or watch the game with. No one to go on a road trip with. No friends to have Friendsgiving with. I have no one. 

I had a best friend when I was young. Jonathan. He lived across the street and we hung out a lot. He was that rare, once in a lifetime friend where you don’t talk for years but when you finally do, it was like not a day had passed since you last talked. We got older, life took its course and we just disconnected. Then he died of a brain tumor I didn’t even know he had. That was a gut punch. That we can be so close going up since we were literally little kids and I didn’t even know he was suffering and battling a brain tumor until it killed him. Made me feel like a piece of shit. 

Then I had a best friend in high school. He went to another school but we hung out a ton until he started getting into the group that went partying in the woods and doing drugs. I wasn’t about that so we drifted after high school. 

Then in my late 20s there was a guy at the firehouse that I just got along with right away. We were very good friends. He ended up eating at my house several times a week. We did everything together. His job schedule was opposite of mine so we started drifting also. The he recently got married and moved a couple towns over and we just stopped talking. We text occasionally but mostly about work. 

And I see some people have large friend groups out in places and I envy them. Just yesterday I was at a ski lodge and saw several groups of people talking and laughing and sharing that experience of togetherness. That bond that only friends can form. I was there with my fiance and her family, whom I like, but it’s not the same. I can’t be the same person in front of her parents as I could with my friends (when I had them). I know it’s way too late in life to find a group of friends that share that bond that takes years to form. Any new friends I make now won’t feel that deep. I know that. I just miss having a friend. 

So here I am, 40 years old, friendless. I do blame myself for part of this. I am not exactly a social butterfly. It takes me some time to open up to someone new. Even at work, it’ll take me some time to warm up to the new guy enough for me to treat them like a work friend. So I’m partly to blame if my new solitary life.",14,1767572007.0,Vent,9,0.94,False

Hey Maximizame fam! Ever feel like you're just going through the motions, a bit... stuck? Like you know there's *more* you could be doing, feeling, achieving, but you're just not quite hitting that stride? I've been there, and honestly, it's a tough spot to be in.

But here's the thing: **stuck isn't a permanent state.** It's often a signal that it's time for a little optimization. Think of your life like a well-oiled machine – sometimes it just needs a quick tune-up to run at its absolute best.

We're all about maximizing our potential here, right? So, let's talk about some simple, actionable daily hacks that can seriously boost both your happiness and your productivity. These aren't earth-shattering revelations, but their power lies in consistent application.

Here are a few that have made a huge difference for me:

*   **The 5-Minute Rule for Starting:** Procrastination is the enemy of progress. If a task feels overwhelming, commit to just *five minutes* of it. Seriously, that's it. More often than not, once you start, you'll find yourself continuing. It breaks the mental barrier.
*   **Schedule Your ""Me Time"" Like an Important Meeting:** We schedule work meetings, dentist appointments, all that jazz. Why don't we schedule in time for ourselves? Whether it's 15 minutes for deep breathing, reading, or just staring out the window, protect that time fiercely. It’s non-negotiable for long-term well-being.
*   **""Eat That Frog"" Early:** This is an oldie but a goodie. Identify your most challenging or important task of the day and tackle it first thing. Get it out of the way, and the rest of your day will feel significantly lighter and more productive.
*   **Mindful Moments Throughout the Day:** We get so caught up in the rush. Try to incorporate micro-moments of mindfulness. Before you check your phone, take three deep breaths. While you're waiting for your coffee, notice the warmth in your hands. These small pauses can reset your nervous system.
*   **Declutter Your Digital Space:** Just like your physical space, your digital environment can create mental clutter. Spend 10 minutes a day tidying up your inbox, desktop, or phone apps. A clean digital space often leads to a clearer mind.

These are just a few ideas, and what works for one person might not work for another. The key is to experiment and find what resonates with *you*.

Sometimes, though, even with the best hacks, life can throw us curveballs that feel incredibly heavy.

I ran the numbers on roasting at home vs buying roasted coffee.

**Setup**

Roaster: SR800 ($330 all-in)

Green coffee: ~$9/lb

Roast loss: ~15% (light/medium)

Batch size: 8 oz green

Roast time: ~15 min per batch

Electricity: ~$0.18/kWh

**Consumption**

56g/day (two people)

≈ 3.75 lb roasted coffee per month

**Costs**

Buying roasted coffee:
$30 per 2 lb → ~$56/month at our actual consumption

Roasting at home:

Green coffee: ~$39.70/month

Electricity: ~$0.60/month

Total: ~$40/month

**Results**

Monthly savings: ~$16

Annual savings: ~$190

Break-even on roaster: ~21 months

Conclusion
Not a huge money-maker, but not a loss either. After ~2 years the roaster pays for itself, and from there it’s ~$200/year in savings — plus better freshness and control. Electricity cost is basically negligible.

Double shot, single walled basket, (the one that was installed when it arrived) inner burr on 1, outter setting on 1, and still the gauge won’t go past the second bar in the “pre-infusion” zone.

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

The different playable fighter's movesets will pull various aspects from their original games like Freddy stuffing you into a mascot suit or Doofas doing some Indiana Jones shit. Just throwing out ideas but I think it'd be super cool to see something like this.

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

I’m very new to the world of brewing my own coffee and espresso. I only really ever did French press before. I’ve just started to try my hand at pour overs. If anyone could help with my below questions I would appreciate it so much. Here is my setup:

Baratza Encore ESP

Kalita Wave 185

Bodum Gooseneck electric kettle 

Timemore Black Mirror scale

1. It’s a little overwhelming to read about all the different recipes. Is there a general guideline that people would use to start with based on my setup? 

2. Is there a general guide for what to set my grinder at depending on light vs medium roast?

3. Does the water temp really matter? My kettle doesn’t tell me the temp. Just want to know how much water temp affects things. 

4. Any direction you can point me in in terms of YouTube channels (yes I know about Hoffmann already), online guides, or whatever else is helpful?

To give you an idea of where I’m at, the most recent settings I used was:

Coffee: 21g, light roast

Water: 375g, exact temp unknown

Grind setting: 22

Total time: 3:45

It tasted fine and def tastes better than my previous attempts, but I still feel like it could be much better and I’m not sure what to do next. ",1,1767570719.0,pourover,9,1.0,False

1q45q02,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1q45q02/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him.

I was born and raised in Athens until around 30y old that I moved in this island for my reasons. During winter months (I own a busy bar/restaurant by the sea) the climate is pretty chill. Mainly some food and drinks for the same locals everyday... A coffee in the morning... A walk by the sea etc. So we are like a family somehow and I got to know many youngsters (if this is a word anymore!?). So by knowing youngest generation we'll, I got into so many new things (gap between generations is a thing guys!!!! 1985-1995 included!!!).

One of them is HIDE AND SEEK WITH CARS! Some guys drive through the business while I was having a cigarette after work.... It was around 23:00. And they asked me if I had see (let's assume) Paris! I asked them, No. Do you play hade and seek? -Yes!

Wow!!!! Is this a thing in your place??? They need to find the other car and horn! Then the other team chases...

I remember many years ago when I had summer vacation in my village, we used to play hide and seek (by feet) but in THE WHOLE village. With some terms ofc. But with cars it should be in another level!",2,1767570499.0,90s,1,0.67,False

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant.

I was immediately drawn to her, but also felt incredibly nervous, so I kept my distance. I ran into her a few more times, and we've had lovely, brief, but deep interactions. There have been a couple of times where we locked eyes for like minutes or so it felt. She was pretty adamant about hanging out, so I reached out to set up a coffee hang out.

I know she's in a domestic partnership with 2 other people. They share two houses together, next door to each other. I've met one at a community event, and it was totally fine. I later expressed sadness to a friend about my crush on Ryan, to which my friend shared, ""Oh, they aren't romantic partners. I think Ryan is dating, you should ask her about it.""

Ryan and I went on our walk today and damn it, now my crush is worse :( She's so funny and thoughtful, and and and. She did address having domestic partners and started talking about their dynamic more at one point, but I don't feel like I know enough to determine what their agreements are.

I know I'm feeling uncomfortable in my not knowing of their set up, and my crush on her. I'm feel uncomfortable because I respect her, and would be more than happy to just be friends and I feel like I'm engaging with her from false pretenses. I'm also in a part of my life where I'm trying to understand my sexual scope. I spent the majority of my teens and 20s in mostly abusive LDRs. I don't really know myself as a person who dates, and gets to know others outside of a nuclear-family expectation set-up. 

My question: Do I say all of this to her? Like we don't really know each other, and have several mutual friends in a tight-ish community (we're both Native). I don't want to make her uncomfortable, and I would like to have some understanding of how to show up in knowing her, if that makes sense?

I honestly don't even know what I would say? Do you think it is too soon to say anything? Should I get to know her more? Is it better to be forthcoming or in my patience? ",0,1767570395.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.25,False

I’m a student working with a small team on a platform called **Meentd**, a local platform which we’ve just launched at [**https://meentd.com**](https://meentd.com/) and which is intended for italian market now at the beginning.  
We’re now looking for **early users who are willing to test it and give honest feedback**.

The platform explores a different way of connecting people. Instead of profiles, feeds, or swiping, everything revolves around **queries** — short posts where users clearly state what they want to do or what they’re looking for. 

Examples:

* “Anyone up for a coffee or walk?”
* “Looking for a tennis partner”
* “Offering / looking for paid services or work”
* “Searching for or offering accommodation”
* “Travel buddies or local meetups”
* Romantic or non-romantic connections

The core idea is **intent over performance**: connections based on what people want to do, not how they present themselves.

* where do you hesitate or get confused?
* what feels unnecessary, missing, or unclear?
* which possible fixes would you propose?
* does this actually solve a real problem, or not?

Trust and safety are central to the project:

* identity verification
* no bots or fake accounts
* basic moderation and security checks
* designed to feel calm and respectful

This isn’t monetization-driven  — it’s a learning project built voluntarily and out of passion and love for people and genuine connections, and feedback matters more to us than growth at this stage.

If you’re open to trying it out and sharing honest thoughts (good or bad), I’d really appreciate it.  
Comments, criticism, and suggestions are all welcome.

He came with his cousin. When it was time to leave, I went straight to the till and paid the whole bill 1100 DA. I gave the cashier 2000 DA, but she needed change. She asked my friend for 200 DA to break it. When she gave me my change back, my friend actually asked me for 100 DA. I gave it to him and walked out.

As I was leaving, I looked back and saw him still standing at the till, trying to pay his part, until the cashier told him I’d already paid for everything. That moment stuck with me.

When I first suggested going to the till, he hesitated, stayed at a distance, clearly planning to pay separately. And that’s what bothered me. We both live abroad I’m in the UK, he’s in France. I know that in Europe, splitting the bill is normal. But living abroad isn’t an excuse. Even Algerians overseas don’t do that with each other. One person pays today, another pays next time. That’s the rule. That’s hospitality.

I never thought I’d see an Algerian bring that “everyone for themselves” mindset back home especially over something as simple as a coffee. So now I realised before going to the till to pay I said let’s go (a la caisse) referencing that we needed to pay and he took a while to come and when he did he stepped far away from me like wanting to pay separately. 

For context Me and my friend both of us live abroad, myself UK and him in France, I know sometimes abroad everyone tend to pay for himself when they are foreigners but I never expected an Algerian wanting to pay alone like it’s our hospitality ?",3,1767570137.0,algeria,30,1.0,False

At night it’s run by a vampire barista, pale and polite, the kind who always remembers your order even if you wish he wouldn’t. During the day, the counter belongs to a gorgon, sunglasses permanently fused to his face, snakes kept calm through habit and caffeine. Both men know me well. I’ve been coming here since high school, back when I still thought I could pretend none of this was real.


I tried bringing my sister once. Asked her to grab coffee, just coffee, nothing weird. She never made it past the door. Said the other customers gave her the creeps. Wouldn’t elaborate. Didn’t have to.


This place is neutral ground. Everyone’s welcome, everyone behaves. I used to do all my deals and meetings here, tucked between the espresso machine and the pastry case like it was the most normal thing in the world.


Werewolves nurse lattes. Vampires linger over cold brews they don’t technically need. Even skinwalkers relax here, shedding borrowed faces for an hour or two. The local police leave the café alone. They know better. Self governed territory. Old rules. Enforced quietly.


The second reason I love this place is the smell. Fresh coffee, dark and bitter, cutting through the desert dust that never quite leaves your lungs.


 The pastries don’t hurt either. Flaky, sweet, dangerous in the way only good things are.

 There’s magic baked into the walls here.

 Whatever you need to feed on, the food and drink will sustain you. It makes keeping a low profile easier. Makes pretending possible.


I’m here for the nostalgia.


It’s been over a year since I last walked through these doors. No reason to come back after I gave up being the Desert Son. No contracts. No favors. No blood on my hands that wasn’t already mine.
I walk a different path now. Narrow. Straight. Only one way forward.


I order my coffee without thinking and carry it to the back, to the only section without windows. I sit with my back to the wall, where I can see everyone and no one can sneak up on me.


Some habits don’t die. They just wait.


I’m not there twenty minutes before I hear familiar footsteps. I don’t need to look up to know it’s my oldest friend, Tommy Baker.


He sets two cups of coffee on the table, careful, like the surface might bite him.


“Hey, Jamie,” he says, easing into the chair across from me. “Sorry for your loss.”


I nod. Keep my face neutral. I’ve had a lot of practice pretending things don’t hurt.


“Thanks for coming,” I tell him. It’s all I’ve got.


Tommy’s known me since before the name. Before the rumors. Before people started lowering their voices when I walked into a room.

 He knows most of the things I did while I carried the title of the Desert Son. The deals. The threats. The kind of violence you justify by telling yourself you’re keeping worse things at bay.
He never believed the demon part. Never bought that something from the dark handed me the name and all the influence that came with it.

 Thought it was delusions of grandeur. Trauma dressed up as destiny. A coping mechanism with teeth.


Maybe he was right.


Tommy wraps his hands around his cup, lets the steam fog his glasses. He doesn’t drink yet.
“So,” he says carefully, “I hear you’re back.”


“Just visiting,” I say.


His mouth tightens. He’s never been good at pretending either.


“People are nervous,” he says. “You show up after being gone this long, after everything that happened, it rattles cages.”


“I’m not here for that,” I tell him. “I’m done.”


He studies my face like he’s looking for cracks. Something old. Something dangerous.


“You said that before,” he says quietly.


I don’t argue. We both remember how that ended.
The café hums around us. Low voices. Cups clinking. A vampire laughs somewhere near the register, too sharp, too loud. The gorgon calls out an order without turning his head.


Tommy finally takes a sip of his coffee.


“She wouldn’t want you doing this alone,” he says.
That one lands. I stare into my cup, watch the surface ripple like it might show me something if I look hard enough.


“I know,” I say. “That’s why I’m here.”


He exhales, slow and tired.


“You always did come back to this place when things got bad.”


“Neutral ground,” I say. “Felt safer.”


“For you,” Tommy says. “Or for everyone else?”


I don’t answer.


Because the truth is, Café Desolation was never just a coffee shop. It was a pause. A place where monsters pretended they were people, and people pretended they weren’t monsters.


And sitting there, with my back to the wall and my oldest friend across from me, I realize something I’ve been trying not to.


I didn’t come back for the coffee.


I came back because whatever I buried when I stopped being the Desert Son didn’t stay buried.
And places like this have a way of reminding you who you really are.


Back in my teenage years, I made a contract with a demon.


Not for power. Not for immortality. I was never stupid enough to think I’d become Dracula or some desert legend carved out of blood and rumor.


The first time I met Coyote, the trickster demon, I was sixteen.


I’d gotten caught lifting a lighter from Spencer’s.

 Nothing dramatic. Just a dumb impulse. Mall cops dragged me into the back room and called my mother, who blew the whole thing into something biblical.


She claimed the local cops were trying to set me up. Said they were learning witchcraft to solve their crimes. Said they’d never stop watching us.
I felt embarrassed for her more than anything. We lived a town over, outside the jurisdiction of the cops who haunted her stories. Different uniforms. Different ghosts.


My mother hated witchcraft. Said it rotted the soul. Said anyone who touched it was already halfway damned.


I was alone in that back room when Coyote showed himself.


“You look bored, kid,” he said. “I can help with that.”


He leaned against the wall like he owned the place. Dark skinned. Red suit too clean for the High Desert. He flicked a golden lighter open and shut, flame snapping to life without fuel.


I stared at him and stayed very still. Thought he was a detective. Or worse, a social worker.


“Come on, kid. Crack a smile,” he said, flashing a grin so wide it reminded me of a waxing moon.
Between flicks of the lighter, he moved. One corner of the room. Then the other. Then right in front of me. No footsteps. No warning.


I laughed.


Not nervous laughter. Real laughter. The kind you get watching a magician onstage when you know you’re being fooled and don’t care.


“That’s better,” Coyote said. “You’re gonna do just fine.”


I asked him who he was.


He asked me what I wanted.


That should have been the warning.


“I don’t want anything,” I told him.


He nodded, pleased.


“Good,” he said. “That makes this easier.”


He told me he wasn’t after my soul. Said souls were messy. Overrated. Hard to store. What he wanted was my attention. My willingness. A door cracked just enough for trouble to slip through.


He said the world was bigger than my mother’s fears and smaller than her delusions. Said there were rules older than the desert, bargains written into dust and bone.


All he wanted was permission.


“So what do I get?” I asked.


Coyote crouched in front of me, lighter flame dancing in his eyes.


“You get to survive,” he said. “You get to see the strings. You get to decide when to pull them.”


The mall cop knocked on the door then. Asked if I was ready to see my mom.


When I looked back, Coyote was gone. The lighter sat on the floor between my shoes, still warm.


I didn’t pick it up.


Didn’t need to.


That night, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling fan wobbling like it might come loose and finish the job, I felt something settle into my chest.


Not power.


Responsibility.


That was the contract. No blood. No signature. Just the understanding that once I stepped into that world willingly, it would step back just as hard.


Months later, they gave me a name for what I became.


The Desert Son.


But sitting here in Café Desolation, coffee cooling in my hands, Tommy watching me like he’s afraid I might disappear again, I finally understand the truth.


Coyote didn’t make me a monster.


He just showed me where the monsters already were.


And once you see that, there’s no pretending you don’t.


Not anymore.


I look Tommy in the eyes and finally say the thing I’ve been circling since he sat down.


“I need your help, Tommy. My mother was killed, and I want to know why. And who did it.”


Tommy takes a slow sip of his coffee. Lets it sit. Lets it burn.


“Revenge?” he asks, voice flat.


“No,” I say.


I mean it.


“Closure.”


He studies me for a long moment, searching for the old fire. The violence. The certainty. Whatever he finds there makes him nod.


“Alright,” he says. “Then we do this the right way.”


The café hums on. Neutral ground. Old rules.


And for the first time since I walked back into the desert, I know exactly where my path leads.


Tommy downs the rest of his coffee like a shot of whiskey, wipes his mouth, and says proudly,

The mall cop knocked on the door then. Asked if I was ready to see my mom.


When I looked back, Coyote was gone. The lighter sat on the floor between my shoes, still warm.


I didn’t pick it up.


Didn’t need to.


That night, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling fan wobbling like it might come loose and finish the job, I felt something settle into my chest.


Not power.


Responsibility.


That was the contract. No blood. No signature. Just the understanding that once I stepped into that world willingly, it would step back just as hard.


Months later, they gave me a name for what I became.


The Desert Son.


But sitting here in Café Desolation, coffee cooling in my hands, Tommy watching me like he’s afraid I might disappear again, I finally understand the truth.


Coyote didn’t make me a monster.


He just showed me where the monsters already were.


And once you see that, there’s no pretending you don’t.


Not anymore.


I look Tommy in the eyes and finally say the thing I’ve been circling since he sat down.


“I need your help, Tommy. My mother was killed, and I want to know why. And who did it.”


Tommy takes a slow sip of his coffee. Lets it sit. Lets it burn.


“Revenge?” he asks, voice flat.


“No,” I say.


I mean it.


“Closure.”


He studies me for a long moment, searching for the old fire. The violence. The certainty. Whatever he finds there makes him nod.


“Alright,” he says. “Then we do this the right way.”


The café hums on. Neutral ground. Old rules.


And for the first time since I walked back into the desert, I know exactly where my path leads.


Tommy downs the rest of his coffee like a shot of whiskey, wipes his mouth, and says proudly,

1q45dhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanfantasy/comments/1q45dhs/the_desert_son_chapter_2/,The Desert Son : Chapter 2,"Café Desolation is the best coffee shop in the entire High Desert. No contest.

At night it’s run by a vampire barista, pale and polite, the kind who always remembers your order even if you wish he wouldn’t. During the day, the counter belongs to a gorgon, sunglasses permanently fused to his face, snakes kept calm through habit and caffeine. Both men know me well. I’ve been coming here since high school, back when I still thought I could pretend none of this was real.


I tried bringing my sister once. Asked her to grab coffee, just coffee, nothing weird. She never made it past the door. Said the other customers gave her the creeps. Wouldn’t elaborate. Didn’t have to.


This place is neutral ground. Everyone’s welcome, everyone behaves. I used to do all my deals and meetings here, tucked between the espresso machine and the pastry case like it was the most normal thing in the world.


Werewolves nurse lattes. Vampires linger over cold brews they don’t technically need. Even skinwalkers relax here, shedding borrowed faces for an hour or two. The local police leave the café alone. They know better. Self governed territory. Old rules. Enforced quietly.


The second reason I love this place is the smell. Fresh coffee, dark and bitter, cutting through the desert dust that never quite leaves your lungs.


 The pastries don’t hurt either. Flaky, sweet, dangerous in the way only good things are.

 There’s magic baked into the walls here.

 Whatever you need to feed on, the food and drink will sustain you. It makes keeping a low profile easier. Makes pretending possible.


I’m here for the nostalgia.


It’s been over a year since I last walked through these doors. No reason to come back after I gave up being the Desert Son. No contracts. No favors. No blood on my hands that wasn’t already mine.
I walk a different path now. Narrow. Straight. Only one way forward.


I order my coffee without thinking and carry it to the back, to the only section without windows. I sit with my back to the wall, where I can see everyone and no one can sneak up on me.


Some habits don’t die. They just wait.


I’m not there twenty minutes before I hear familiar footsteps. I don’t need to look up to know it’s my oldest friend, Tommy Baker.


He sets two cups of coffee on the table, careful, like the surface might bite him.


“Hey, Jamie,” he says, easing into the chair across from me. “Sorry for your loss.”


I nod. Keep my face neutral. I’ve had a lot of practice pretending things don’t hurt.


“Thanks for coming,” I tell him. It’s all I’ve got.


Tommy’s known me since before the name. Before the rumors. Before people started lowering their voices when I walked into a room.

 He knows most of the things I did while I carried the title of the Desert Son. The deals. The threats. The kind of violence you justify by telling yourself you’re keeping worse things at bay.
He never believed the demon part. Never bought that something from the dark handed me the name and all the influence that came with it.

 Thought it was delusions of grandeur. Trauma dressed up as destiny. A coping mechanism with teeth.


Maybe he was right.


Tommy wraps his hands around his cup, lets the steam fog his glasses. He doesn’t drink yet.
“So,” he says carefully, “I hear you’re back.”


“Just visiting,” I say.


His mouth tightens. He’s never been good at pretending either.


“People are nervous,” he says. “You show up after being gone this long, after everything that happened, it rattles cages.”


“I’m not here for that,” I tell him. “I’m done.”


He studies my face like he’s looking for cracks. Something old. Something dangerous.


“You said that before,” he says quietly.


I don’t argue. We both remember how that ended.
The café hums around us. Low voices. Cups clinking. A vampire laughs somewhere near the register, too sharp, too loud. The gorgon calls out an order without turning his head.


Tommy finally takes a sip of his coffee.


“She wouldn’t want you doing this alone,” he says.
That one lands. I stare into my cup, watch the surface ripple like it might show me something if I look hard enough.


“I know,” I say. “That’s why I’m here.”


He exhales, slow and tired.


“You always did come back to this place when things got bad.”


“Neutral ground,” I say. “Felt safer.”


“For you,” Tommy says. “Or for everyone else?”


I don’t answer.


Because the truth is, Café Desolation was never just a coffee shop. It was a pause. A place where monsters pretended they were people, and people pretended they weren’t monsters.


And sitting there, with my back to the wall and my oldest friend across from me, I realize something I’ve been trying not to.


I didn’t come back for the coffee.


I came back because whatever I buried when I stopped being the Desert Son didn’t stay buried.
And places like this have a way of reminding you who you really are.


Back in my teenage years, I made a contract with a demon.


Not for power. Not for immortality. I was never stupid enough to think I’d become Dracula or some desert legend carved out of blood and rumor.


The first time I met Coyote, the trickster demon, I was sixteen.


I’d gotten caught lifting a lighter from Spencer’s.

 Nothing dramatic. Just a dumb impulse. Mall cops dragged me into the back room and called my mother, who blew the whole thing into something biblical.


She claimed the local cops were trying to set me up. Said they were learning witchcraft to solve their crimes. Said they’d never stop watching us.
I felt embarrassed for her more than anything. We lived a town over, outside the jurisdiction of the cops who haunted her stories. Different uniforms. Different ghosts.


My mother hated witchcraft. Said it rotted the soul. Said anyone who touched it was already halfway damned.


I was alone in that back room when Coyote showed himself.


“You look bored, kid,” he said. “I can help with that.”


He leaned against the wall like he owned the place. Dark skinned. Red suit too clean for the High Desert. He flicked a golden lighter open and shut, flame snapping to life without fuel.


I stared at him and stayed very still. Thought he was a detective. Or worse, a social worker.


“Come on, kid. Crack a smile,” he said, flashing a grin so wide it reminded me of a waxing moon.
Between flicks of the lighter, he moved. One corner of the room. Then the other. Then right in front of me. No footsteps. No warning.


I laughed.


Not nervous laughter. Real laughter. The kind you get watching a magician onstage when you know you’re being fooled and don’t care.


“That’s better,” Coyote said. “You’re gonna do just fine.”


I asked him who he was.


He asked me what I wanted.


That should have been the warning.


“I don’t want anything,” I told him.


He nodded, pleased.


“Good,” he said. “That makes this easier.”


He told me he wasn’t after my soul. Said souls were messy. Overrated. Hard to store. What he wanted was my attention. My willingness. A door cracked just enough for trouble to slip through.


He said the world was bigger than my mother’s fears and smaller than her delusions. Said there were rules older than the desert, bargains written into dust and bone.


All he wanted was permission.


“So what do I get?” I asked.


Coyote crouched in front of me, lighter flame dancing in his eyes.


“You get to survive,” he said. “You get to see the strings. You get to decide when to pull them.”


The mall cop knocked on the door then. Asked if I was ready to see my mom.


When I looked back, Coyote was gone. The lighter sat on the floor between my shoes, still warm.

If we were actually predestined to meet like I assume you believe we were from that one Reddit profile I stumbled upon on here, and that the stars did actually align for us to meet like that one Drake song then I would believe that our storylines did, and should have many similarities between them, past, present and future. 

Don’t you wish we could go back knowing everything we know now? Oh how we’d do things so differently, right? 

So I shall ask you, are you having a terrible time here as much as I am? Years upon years have slowly started catching up with you, in your physical and emotional self. Did you not realize I saw those baggy under eyes of yours that fateful day when I saw you at our local coffee shop two years ago? Your quiet forced demeanor tells me you are tired and it’s only a matter of time before you implode on yourself like a dying star. Your smooth yet cold detached demeanor and anxiety ridden behavior beneath the surface of that painful wonderful smile of yours tells me everything I need to know at first and last glance. It tells me you wish you could start all over again, you contemplate whether or not in continuing to pursue or give up on getting that degree in business you always wanted to get, but you don’t know how to start again mainly because you can’t seem to live with some of the life choices you’ve made in your past. It’s all too ugly now.

Don’t you wish we could go back knowing everything we know now? Oh how we’d do things so differently, right? 

For example, I wouldn’t have portrayed myself to be such an absolute mess when I first met you, gaining the knowledge I have now, I’d go back and pretend a lot more and hide aspects of myself from you that I’d know you’d despise. Using the act of deception I’d make you fall in love with me, even if it’d be mostly all lies I would spin to you. I was too naive then to think I didn’t have any red flags, of course I did. If I did that maybe you’d think of me in a more memorable and positive way than you do now, even if it ended up being a facade, at least you’d still think of me. How pathetic do I sound? What have you done to me?

Now I’m left wondering how you think of me after all these years, it’s probably in the same way I think of that one lying selfish b@stard that I had a brief rendezvous with which I’ll call a momentary lapse in judgment, that only talked to me when they needed something. I truly hope you don’t think of me in that same regard. Oh, how could I think about someone so highly and angel-like sent from heaven when you seem to not even care about whether I live or die like an ant farm being stomped on with no regard. How does it feel? To be so longed for, so needed and so desired after all these years?

He told me he recently got his one year chip. What he’s never conquered is his hair-trigger temper.

My brother and I are on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and we’ve been able to tease each other about it, until yesterday morning. While getting my coffee, I said “looks like Trump’s Peace Prize is on hold.” To which he launched into a tirade about abortion, Biden’s corruption, and other grievances. Although I initially tried for dialogue, I broke it off immediately when I saw his anger rising logarithmically.

I took my girls home yesterday, and this morning my brother sent me what might be the nastiest text I’ve ever gotten. “Too bad you ran out of here like the cuck beta p\*\*\*\*y you are,” it starts out, and gets worse from there. He warns me never to speak to him again. I am fine going no-contact with him, but the problem is he lives with my aging mother.

I’ve got my own place and a stable setup in the UK, but life’s been too quiet for too long.
 I don’t really have family around anymore, and the loneliness has been hitting harder than I’d like to admit — so instead of just sitting with it, I’m trying to do something about it and actually build a real connection with someone.

I’m looking to talk with a younger English/
American woman who’s kind, curious, and a little playful — someone who enjoys conversation, has a sense of humour, and isn’t afraid to be real about life, feelings, and where they’re at.

 I’m not here for games, breadcrumbing, or endless small talk that goes nowhere. 

I want proper chats, late-night conversations, laughing about nonsense one minute and talking about deeper stuff the next.

I’m not trying to rush anything, but I am looking to move forward in my life rather than staying stuck. 

If we click and the chemistry feels genuine, I’d love the idea of planning a near-future visit to the UK together — nothing unrealistic or pressured, just something we’d talk through when it naturally makes sense.

 I’ve got a comfortable place here, and it’d be nice to share it with a real human instead of just the sofa and background TV noise.

About me: grounded, a mix of serious and silly, introverted at times but loyal and thoughtful once I’m comfortable. I like walks, coffee, quiet moments, long conversations, and just having someone to share everyday life with — the kind of connection you really miss when you don’t have anyone around.

If you’ve also been feeling lonely, or you’re curious about getting to know someone genuine from across the pond, or you just want someone real to talk to now instead of “maybe someday,” send me a message and say hi. Worst case, we have some good conversations.

For complex systems, AI agents live inside the codebase itself.
They crawl the repo, fix bugs, write tests, refactor code, and commit changes on their own.

A digital workforce that never sleeps

Not copilots. Not autocomplete. Actual agents doing ongoing engineering work without supervision.

Beyond coding: total company automation

Once software is automated, the same logic applies to operations, planning, and even parts of management. Code is just the first domino.

If this plays out, “learning to code” becomes less important than learning to think clearly, describe intent, and spot good ideas.

Some machines say 10–12 cups, others say 4 cups, and then I keep seeing people mention that a “cup” isn’t the same as a standard measuring cup.

This came up because a lot of advice online says to size your coffee maker based on how many people you’re brewing for, but I’m not sure how accurate that is if the cup size is smaller than expected. A 12-cup drip machine sounds like it should easily handle a few people, but if those cups are only 5 oz each, that changes things a bit.

For those who’ve owned different types of coffee makers (drip, single-serve, combo machines, etc.), how many *real* cups of coffee do you feel they brew at once? Do you usually find the advertised cup count misleading, or does it line up with how you actually use it?

It has been quite journey, I did a lot of stuff wrong, but finally after fixing all mistakes things got much better, so it's time to share everything I've learned.

**Video Guide:**  [TOP 5 Water Fasting Mistakes Most Beginners Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95JJl_zJTs0&list=PLOl7VpD6Qzv9zLBDN6H4QGFsyKUo21cVo&index=1)

**Mistake #1**: **Not having a plan.**  
Long fast is an undertaking, and just jumping into it villi-nilly is a risky proposition. I think about it as climbing mount Everest. You need to prep, acclimatize and think your both ways up and down. Plan prep meals, plan to avoid gatherings with food. Plan your exercise routine.  *Structure makes life much easier!* 

**Mistake #2**: **Not doing at least a short keto prep before the fast.**  
Fasting will be a deep ketosis. It takes time for your body to shift all the enzymatic machinery to burn fat efficiently. Warming it up ahead of time is HUGE help.

**Mistake #3: Not exercising.**  
If you sit and do nothing the body starts to burn muscles for sugar. And that's how you loose strength. Walking and light resistance training gives all the right signal for the muscle upkeep and restores energy.

**Mistake #4: Skimping on electrolytes or flavors.**  
It is nowadays well covered everywhere.. but imagine me in 2005 doing 10 days water fast without any electrolytes... ugh that was a miserable experience. Don't be like me then.  Use electrolytes, use lemon or a bit of ACV to make water tastier, use tea and black coffee (if you are not doing a full gut rest) - they are great especially the first few days to combat hunger.

**Mistake #5: Eating too much too quickly on exit**  
I actually never did this mistake myself (probably the only one I've avoided:), but I've seen quite a few people who break the fast with a feast. That's a good way to end up with huge indigestion.  My rule of thumb is - for each day in fast to have a day of exit. So 5 days fast means 5 days of breaking it by slowly increasing food amount and density. Starting with diluted bone broth on day 1. And slowly adding liquid fats and fiber.

And now into tips

**Tip #1: Low saturated fat keto**  
Some people based on their *PPARs* genes makeup and some other personal factors do not process saturated fats very well. So avocados, macadamia nuts, almond flour, lots of olive oils, salmon & sardines are all good choices then.

**Tip #2: Burn off glycogen**  
To get to the fasting benefits faster get rid of glycogen stores with some HIT training the last day of prep. (I personally do hill sprints and bike climbs) This is especially important during shorter 3 day fasts.

**Tip #3: Staying warm**  
I prefer to fast in May when it's getting warm and the rejuvenation of the nature aligns with autophagy and apoptosis and it feels just right. Plus you can use a simple *foot warmer* mat during the day and Epsom salt foot bath before sleep. (helps with sleep too btw)

**Tip #4: Crystal salt snack**  
I carry around a tiny box of Hawaiian large crystal black salt. Whenever I feel off or people around are eating - I dissolve a crystal in my mouth - it's a pure bliss. (Sometimes crunching ice might be fun too, but be careful with teeth)

**Tip #5: Ride the keto out**  
A lot of fasting benefits come from low ketone-glucose index (GKI). You can extend this window by upkeeping keto diet while slowly breaking the fast. This also helps with appetite control and overeating. 

**Finally - Every fast is different.**   
It's important to listen to your body and stop if you are feeling too bad or too stressed. (some Ashwagandha might be a good idea when re-feeding)  
**It is better to come back later and try again than burn out.**

I (28F now) was diagnosed with gastritis in the spring of 2022 after an upper endoscopy. I’ve done so much research but still feel like I understand it very little, for example all the articles I read say you need to take antibiotics but my doctor said I don’t & that it’s incurable and can only be managed.

Anyways, it went away after a while and I went back to normal. I never really thought about it - I wasn’t directly told it was incurable, I guess it was either something the doctor only told my mother or I was too high on fentanyl (they anesthetized me for the endoscopy) to remember.

Now, I’m also autistic and have a very limited list of “safe foods”. This list will make every gastritis patient cringe. I drank nothing but pomegranate lemonade, I ate fried chicken (with more lemonade) for lunch almost every day, I ate a lot of acidic fruits like raspberries and strawberries and oranges, I drank a specialty coffee with milk and espresso every day before I switched to the lemonade.

So it’s kind of amazing that it took three whole years to come back, but of course it did. In October 2025, I started having stomach issues again. In late November, I ate some really spicy chicken wings and a few days later everything crashed a thousand times harder. I don’t know if one incident can trigger a huge episode like that, or if it can come a couple days after that food, but ever since I ate those spicy wings I’ve been inconsolable.

My digestive track feels raw and sore and irritated from the top of my throat to the bottom of my intestines. I regularly throw up (I always have, I’ve always had gut problems, but it’s gotten worse) I can’t sleep on any position but ON my stomach, putting as much pressure on my stomach as possible. I have so much acid reflux. It feels horrible.

The psychological effects are horrendous, too. I don’t know if this is just a coincidence, but the first time this happened I had really bad mental health and regular panic attacks for no reason. Now it’s much the same. I think about death and dying and the inexorable march of time constantly. I can’t look at any living thing I care about without wondering how much time we have left. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I’m dying, like my heart is stopping or my breathing is stopping or my stomach is dropping.

I don’t know what else to say. I don’t know why I’m writing this, I just need someone to understand me. My partner seems to be really annoyed and bothered by my suffering, so I’m not comfortable asking for sympathy. I don’t know anyone else with gastritis personally.

I hope I’ll be ok soon. I’ve been on omeprazole, but I lost it a few days ago and have been getting worse since. I saw my PCP when this began at the end of November, and I have a follow-up tomorrow morning. I will explain what I’m struggling with and ask for more omeprazole.

I anticipate we’ll spend a majority of our time at the rental but will likely go out most nights for dinner. A spa day, cooking class, crab island excursion, and a sunset booze cruise have also been discussed.

1q44wet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q44wet,Regional Tamagotchi Shop Tama Search Special Sticker Codes ✨🛜✨,"What a line up we've got with these Tama Destinations characters! In January of 2025, it was [announced](https://tamagotchi-official.com/jp/news/01_833/) that Bandai Namco Cross stores across Japan would be selling their own unique Tamagotchi Original shells that would feature various aspects of that region's food and culture. With originally 5 in total from the [Kanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region), [Touhouku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dhoku_region), [Toukai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkai_region), [Kansai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region), and [Kyuushuu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu) regions, this meant that fans would have to travel to each region's Bandai Namco Cross store in order to collect their respective shell. Later in early November, a 6th shell design for [Okinawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture) was [announced](https://tamagotchi-official.com/jp/news/01_1224/), as well as an [announcement](https://tamagotchi-official.com/jp/news/01_1220/) for the Tama Search Sticker characters for each corresponding region that could be collected on the Uni. The regional character stickers could be found in their participating respective Bandai Namco store, where they could be collected by doing a Tama Search while onsite. But thanks to some lovely fans who went to these stores to grab the code to share, anyone can receive these character stickers! I thought it might be fun to go into detail about the cultural references on each of the destination shells since they all feature such detailed designs, but if that doesn't interest you feel free to scroll down to the bottom of this post for the codes. 

Starting with the Kanto region, home of the city of Tokyo which is considered to be the main hub of Japanese culture and fashion, we have the **Kanto Destination** shell. On the left side we can see Kuchipatchi and Mametchi dressed as [Kogyaru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogal), an subsection of the [Gyaru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyaru) alternative fashion culture, wearing hibiscus in their hair and Japanese high school girl uniforms characterized by their [loose socks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slouch_sock#Loose_sock). Below them can be seen an old school flip phone, or [keitai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mobile_phone_culture#), that had peaked in popularity for teens during the 90s once purchasing one became more affordable for the average consumer. Fun fact side tangent: ""pager slang"" took off as well for cell phones during this decade. For example, texting someone the numbers ""14106"" translated to ""I love you/あいしてる"" (1 visibly mimicking the English ""I"" while pronounced similarly as ""あい/ai"", 4 pronounced ""し/shi"", 10 mimicking the sound of ""て/te"", and 6 having been contracted to ""る/ru"" from ""ろく/roku""). Along the bottom we see leopard and zebra print patterns and a grouping of hibiscus, both staples of gyaru fashion trends. And on the right side we see a girl's school bag, a shopping bag, and a crepe, the latter being particularly popular in Harajuku which is known for being a hub of alternative fashion trends as it was for gyaru in the 90s. Definitely my favorite of the destination shells because of how nostalgic it is with the brand having originated in the late 90s when kogyaru and early flip phone culture was at its most popular!

Next comes the **Touhouku Destination** shell found at the Bandai Namco Cross store in Sendai. Starting on the left side we see a [Kokeshi doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokeshi) which is an over 150 year old hand-crafted tradition originating from the region, Mametchi dressed as a [zunda mochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zunda-mochi), and some [sasa kamaboko](https://shun-gate.com/en/roots/roots_14/) which is a baked fish paste treat popular in the area with ""sasa"" specifically referring to the bamboo sprout shape they are formed into. Along the bottom of the screen is a plate of [gyutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C5%ABtan), or beef tongue. On the right of the shell we can see iconography of bamboo stalks and streamers from the [Tanabata Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata#Sendai_festival), where the most famous of the country's festivals is held in the city of Sendai. And finally we have Kuchipatchi dressed up as [Masamune Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_Masamune), a renowned samurai and daimyo who founded the city of Sendai in 1600!

Just below the Kanto region, we have our **Tokai Destination** shell that could be purchased from the Nagoya Bandai Namco Cross store starting in the Spring of 2025. In the top left sits [Shachitchi](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Shachitchi), a Tamagotchi based off of Japanese folklore sea monsters known as [Shachihoko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shachihoko) that often adorn the top of castle roofs most famously the [Nagoya Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_Castle). Shachitchi is sitting atop of an onigiri to mimic the look of the shrimp tempura onigiri, also known as ebimusu, that sits right below him. Right below the onigiri pair is Mametchi dressed as a waiter due to the region's ""morning cafe"" culture, which leans into the next iconography seen in the top right, [ogura toast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogura_toast). A breakfast staple of Nagoya, ogura toast has been around since the 1920s that supposedly originated from a cafe owner combining red bean paste and toast after noticing customers order sweet red bean soup to dip their plain toast in. Lastly we can see an outdoor sign for cafes/coffee shops, nicely tying the Tokai region cafe motif together.

To the west of the Tokai region, we have the **Kansai Destination** shell that could be purchased from the Bandai Namco Cross store at Osaka Umeda. The shell starts off with the logo at the top overlaid on a [noren curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noren), signifying that the shell is going to be focused on the culinary culture of the Kinki region, Osaka in particular having been referred to as the ""Kitchen of Japan"" during the Edo period. To the left we can see an octopus dressed as a street vendor above a dish of [takoyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki) (a bit morbid, given the main ingredient in takoyaki...), a popular street food. Mametchi can also be seen dressed up as a takoyaki ball with a toothpick sticking out of the top of his head, the toothpick being a popular method of eating takoyaki on the go. On the right of the shell it starts off with a Chinese inspired pork bun. While typically referred to as ""nikuman"" in most parts of Japan, in the Kansai area they are called ""butaman"" and can be purchased from a particularly famous pork bun shop called [551 Horai](https://lala-love-nippon.com/551-horais-butaman/). Right below the pork buns is a Kuchipatchi who is referred to as ""Mom Kuchipatchi"" in the Uni sticker name. In Japanese, this Kuchipatchi is called ""おかん/okan"" being the [Kansai-ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_dialect) way of calling an older woman mom, while also visually representing an [Oba-chan](https://japanese-culture.sakuraweb.com/the-secret-behind-the-vibrant-energy-of-osakas-obachans-and-their-love-for-sharing-candy/), or middle aged women who are known to dress eccentrically and even give out candy to passersby. Lastly, along the bottom of the shell is an [okonomiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki), a savory pancake dish that can be grilled yourself in okonomiyaki restaurants that features griddles in the middle of their tables. Anyone else hungry after looking too much at this shell?

From the southern most region of Japan comes the **Kyuushuu Destination** shell, available at the Bandai Namco Cross store in Hakatauchi. The top of the shell is adorned with [mentaiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock_roe#Japanese), or spicy fermented cod roe, popular in the region, with Mametchi to the left side dressed up as a type of onigiri known as [mentaiko onigiri](https://onigiris.net/fillings/mentaiko-onigiri/). Below Mametchi is a lantern labelled ""屋台/yatai"", or [food stall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatai_(food_cart)), where ramen is often sold and consumed from on city sidewalks, as we can see Kuchipatchi chowing down on on the right side of the shell. 

Branching south from the main Kyuushuu island are the many smaller islands of Okinawa, giving the cultural iconography of the **Okinawa Destination** shell that had only become available starting in late November of 2025 at the Sunny Urasoe West Coast Parco City Bandai Namco Cross store. Starting with the top of the shell above the Tamagotchi logo is the [Hanagasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryusou#) flower hat worn by women when performing a traditional Okinawan dance known as Yotsudake. On the top of either sides of the shell sits Mametchi and Kuchipatchi dressed as the [Shisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shisa) guardian lion dogs of Okinawa mythology. As Okinawa is a subtropical climate similar to Hawaii, what's more appropriate than adding some tropical imagery as seen along the bottom half of the shell with its tropical reef, plumeria flowers, bitter melons, mangoes, and pineapples!

I learned quite a bit doing the research for naming each of the designs on these shells, so I hope you enjoyed learning a little more about Japanese culture for those who read through the above paragraphs.

I just had a bad trip recently. 

Here’s what it felt like. 

I’m way too high, the floor is too hard, trash from fast food and half full soda cans litter the room, I’m way too high. Before me the tv sits on a shitty coffee table, its legs bent and barely holding the heap up. Outside wind blows hard enough to make the house groan, like the breathing of an old person. With a considerable amount of effort my eyes look down, my legs are covered by (way too) short jean shorts, sheer stockings full of tiny holes, fishnets that have had new holes opened one too many times. Fuck I am way too high, my head buzzes. My finger nails dig into the cuffs of my brown sweater, it’s my dysphoria sweater and the only thing keeping me from feeling completely ashamed of myself. It’s cute, the sweater that is, it has a little vanilla colored stripe on the chest. 

  

 None of this makes any sense, no one wants to read this. I suppose this acts as a diary of my thoughts, to be picked at or studied. Next to me is my friend, or for the moment the closest thing there is to one of those in my life. Her name is Jenna, a constant reminder of the subpar friends that clutter my life. Lights flash, horse girls race on the screen before me. Lights flash, Jenna's ex girlfriend is making some brain dead joke I can’t even remember, lights flash, everything is staring. 

 Things are spinning, in my brain what feels like pop rocks are going off, buzzing fills my ears, everything is too much right now. With all my desire to be rid of these feelings I stand, my hair is a long shaggy mess that I play with instead of speaking. After a moment of Jenna staring at me reality catches up. 

“Be right back, gonna call my girlfriend.”

Jenna looks disappointed but ever so gently pats my leg, asking 

“Are you alright? Do you want us to pause this for you?” 

A sweet gesture, but her disappointment is making me feel horrible about having stood up or even being here. “No-” I mumble “-no don’t bother, I’ll be okay” manages to leave my mouth as I stumble forward. It’s a challenging walk to make, avoiding all the trash and my ‘friends’ belongings scattered across the floor. Down the hallway, into the empty dining space outside their ominously empty kitchen, tucking myself away in their equally vacant laundry room. The floor is covered in dust and debris, above me the lights manage to turn on but only a dim flicker of light that barely manages to drive away the shadows. It’s a terrible place to be while high, yet I find myself unable to leave. Windows rattle as the house takes another deep breath, buzzing fills the room. 

  What am I doing here? 

  I had been so alone back in my sisters apartment, barely living a life that meant anything. Recently my job had let all its temp hires go, which included me. The meat packing plant had promised 40 hour weeks, 4 days a week, but had only  been a mismanaged mess that barely ever gave me more than 25 hours weekly. That 3 day run of 10 hour shifts scared me, a sign of something that didn’t involve me, a quick run to use me up for all the labor I was worth before tossing me aside. Two months of misgendering, of dead naming, of slamming monsters and sucking back menthols like it was my only hope. 

  I couldn’t help, tears start gathering. The last two days with Jenna and her third wheeling ex had been Hell. My last stay was equally bad but at least my efforts to clean their disgusting home had been fruitful- had made my time there bearable. When I first arrived for the current stay it was beyond disappointing to find the entire house ruined, like my work meant nothing. Because it did not mean a damn thing, nothing I ever did meant anything to anyone. My life was barely starting yet every day that sense of dread filled my guts. Dragging me down to the bottom. This dark room, flickering lights, strained breathing, it scared me. 

“Please, please, please answer.” 

  My phone rang, a dim light acting as a beacon of safety in this terrible place. My little safe place, my phone, my prison. 

“Lover? Are you okay, what’s up?” 

 It was everything I needed, her sheepish little voice.

“No lover, I made a mistake.”

 It’s around that time the guilt, the embarrassment shows up, my girlfriend has been going through a lot with her family. Even calling to tell her this is selfish, I’m selfish.

“Lover? Are you okay?”

 She sounds so sweet, so uncertain.  Yet despite everything solid, reliable. 

“I’m sorry. This shouldn’t be happening, I’m sorry...”

 the words come out as a mumble.

Snot is dribbling down my face and she soothes me, attempting to calm me as my panic attack drives me into the corner of this dingy room. She listens as I mumble, telling her how scared I am, how all this snot makes me feel like a kid. My mind folds over the memories, words blend together, my lover was there for me, she wasn’t upset with me, I still remember my words to her. These words play on repeat. 

“It’s not okay, It’s not okay-” between tears I wipe my nose gasping for air, “-I’m supposed to be there for you, I’m supposed to support you b-but I’m off in this dump getting high!” 

“Please calm down, lover, get some water. Get out of the dark.”

Her words are lost to me, despite its warmth the breathing overshadows her

.

“IT’S NOT OKAY! I AM NOT THERE FOR YOU, I’M NEVER THERE FOR YOU- FOR ANYONE!” 

Cold air tickles my ankles, makes my goosebumps worse. The breathing overshadows me. 

Maybe you should lower your voice? Someone’s knocking at the door to try and check on us

“MY ENTIRE LIFE IS JUST ME USING PEOPLE!” through gritted teeth I choke back just enough tears to shout again. “MY ENTIRE LIFE IS ME FREE LOADING, ME MOOCHING, ME BEING A OBSTACLE IN EVERYONE ELSE’S LIFE, EVEN YOURS!” At this point my head is on fire, the world is spinning in every direction as that knocking grows louder in my mind. Someone comes to check on me, that someone opens the door, Jenna opens the door. A short black shape stands in the doorway, light from the kitchen shining behind her and hiding the details of their face from me. At this point I’m in the corner of her laundry room, sobbing and screaming like a maniac as she advances towards me. Everything should be safe, I should be safe, but as her tiny hands reach out to me I fall, my self loathing turning to fear as my ‘friend’ descends. 

“Please wait, please wait, PLEASE WAIT DON’T TOUCH ME!!”

  I choke out but it’s too late she’s touching me, trying to comfort me, pulling me down as fingers graze every inch of my skin. Fingers dig into every hole, fingers tickle every spot on my body, fingers dig into my flesh, fingers pull me apart, fingers meld and merge with my cold skin, our bodies conjoining in a lukewarm heap on the ground. Veins intertwining as blood mixes and bones fuse. Even now. 

I do not know what happened. I still don’t.

1q44uqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q44uqj/camping_cookware_set_for_solo_hiking_which_one/,Camping cookware set for solo hiking: which one?,"When you're planning a solo hiking trip, choosing the right camping cookware set can make or break your outdoor cooking experience. The wrong gear means cold meals, extra weight, and frustrated evenings at camp.

For solo hikers, lightweight aluminum cookware sets work best. They heat up fast and won't weigh down your backpack. Look for sets that include a small pot, pan, and maybe a cup. You don't need anything fancy – just something that gets the job done.

**What to Look For**

Your camping cookware set should have a few key features. Non-stick coating makes cleanup easier when you're miles from running water. Folding handles save space in your pack. Some sets come with a mesh bag to keep everything together.

Weight matters more than you think. Every ounce counts when you're carrying everything on your back. A good solo camping cookware set weighs less than two pounds total.

**Size and Capacity**

For one person, you need a pot that holds about 1-2 liters. This gives you enough space to boil water for meals, coffee, or cleaning. A small frying pan around 6-8 inches works well for cooking eggs, fish, or heating up food.

Stackable pieces are your friend. The best outdoor cooking gear nests together like Russian dolls. This saves valuable pack space for other essentials.

**Heat Distribution**

Thin aluminum heats fast but can create hot spots that burn food. Slightly thicker bases spread heat better without adding much weight. You want your camping cookware to work well with small camp stoves that don't put out even heat.

**Popular Options**

Many solo hikers love titanium sets because they're super light. But they cost more and don't heat as evenly as aluminum. Stainless steel lasts forever but weighs too much for most backpackers.

If you want to see some highly-rated camping cookware sets that work great for solo trips, check out [this collection of outdoor cooking gear](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) that includes options for every budget.

**Maintenance Tips**

Keep your portable camping cookware clean to make it last longer. Bring a small scrubber pad and biodegradable soap. Let everything dry completely before packing to prevent rust and bad smells.

Store sharp edges carefully so they don't poke holes in your pack or other gear.

**Final Thoughts**

The right camping cookware set makes solo hiking meals something to look forward to instead of dread. Focus on lightweight, compact options that fit your cooking style. Whether you're boiling water for instant meals or cooking fresh fish, having reliable outdoor cooking gear makes every trip better.

These small devices let you control lights, appliances, and electronics from anywhere using your smartphone.

**Top Features to Look For**

You'll want smart plugs that work reliably with weak WiFi signals, since vacation homes often have spotty internet. Look for models with strong antennas and good range. Remote access capability is essential - make sure the plugs work through apps when you're miles away from your property.

Timer functions help create the illusion that someone's home. You can schedule lamps to turn on at sunset and off at bedtime. Some smart plugs also monitor energy usage, which helps you catch appliances that accidentally got left running.

**Best Uses for Vacation Homes**

Smart plugs work great for controlling outdoor lighting, porch lights, and interior lamps for security purposes. You can also use them with small appliances like coffee makers, fans, or space heaters. If you want to prep your home before arrival, you can turn on air conditioning units or dehumidifiers remotely.

**Weather Resistance Matters**

For outdoor use, choose smart plugs with weather-resistant ratings. Indoor models work fine for controlling lamps and small electronics, but outdoor outlets need plugs that handle rain and temperature changes.

**WiFi vs. Hub-Based Systems**

WiFi-enabled smart plugs are easier to set up since they connect directly to your internet. Hub-based systems might offer more reliability but require additional hardware. For most vacation homes, [WiFi smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) provide the simplest solution.

**Installation and Setup**

Most smart plugs take just minutes to install. You download the app, plug the device into your outlet, and follow the connection steps. The key is making sure your vacation home has stable internet before you leave.

**Cost Considerations**

Smart plugs range from budget options around $10 to premium models near $30. For vacation homes, you don't need the most expensive features. Focus on reliability and remote access rather than fancy extras.
