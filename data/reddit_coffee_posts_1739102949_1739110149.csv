Frankly, I didn’t have high expectations given its price point, but this little table has genuinely surprised me. From its simple design to its functionality, it has a lot going for it—though it’s not without its quirks.

The design is undeniably minimalist, with a black oak woodgrain finish that fits well into most décor styles, especially modern and contemporary spaces. The engineered wood construction was a bit of a concern initially, but the table has held up nicely, even when my nephew decided it was his racecar track for the day. Its lightweight build makes it easy to move around, though that also means it’s not the sturdiest option out there. I wouldn’t recommend sitting on it or overloading it with heavy items.

The dimensions—19""D x 39""W x 17.5""H—make it ideal for small apartments, dorm rooms, or cozy living rooms. It’s compact enough to fit snugly in tight spaces but offers enough surface area for essentials like a laptop, a coffee mug, or a stack of books. However, if you’re planning to use it for larger gatherings or to hold multiple decorative items, you might find the space a bit limiting.

Being a hollow-core table, I was curious about its stability, and I’ll admit, it does wobble slightly if pushed hard. Still, it’s perfectly adequate for everyday use, especially if you’re not planning to load it with heavy objects. The surface is water-resistant, which has been a real blessing. Cleaning up spills is as simple as wiping with a damp cloth, so it’s been perfect for someone like me, who’s prone to coffee mishaps during work-from-home days.

Assembly was a breeze. I’m not exactly known for my DIY skills, yet I managed to screw the legs on and set it up in under 10 minutes. The instructions were clear, and I appreciated that no additional tools were required. Still, the lightweight material means you should handle it with care during assembly to avoid overtightening or damaging parts.

**Pros**

* Affordable and budget-friendly.
* Lightweight and easy to move.
* Simple assembly process that takes minutes.
* Water-resistant surface makes cleaning effortless.
* Minimalist design that fits a variety of décor styles.

**Cons**

* Not the most stable; wobbles slightly when pushed.
* Limited surface area for larger gatherings or heavy use.
* Lightweight build may not withstand excessive weight.
* Lacks a premium feel due to the hollow-core construction.

Comparing it to competitors like the Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table or IKEA’s LACK table, the Parsons coffee table stands out for its straightforward assembly and water-resistant finish. The Furinno model, while similarly priced, feels slightly less sturdy in my experience. On the other hand, IKEA’s LACK offers a slightly more refined aesthetic but requires more effort to assemble and doesn’t offer the same resistance to spills. For someone who values easy maintenance and functionality over high-end aesthetics, the Parsons table takes the win.

In terms of value for money, it’s hard to beat. While it doesn’t scream luxury, it offers a level of functionality and style that’s impressive for its price point. It’s a great choice for those on a budget or anyone needing a temporary solution, such as college students or first-time apartment renters. Sure, it might not last forever, but for what it costs, it’s a solid investment.

The features are straightforward and practical. The hollow-core design keeps the weight down, while the black oak finish adds a touch of sophistication. It’s not customizable, and you won’t find any hidden compartments or lift-top mechanisms, but that simplicity is part of its appeal. The straight-leg style and rectangular shape give it a timeless look that blends into almost any room.

1ilfcej,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1ilfcej/any_recommendations_based_off_what_i_already_like/,Any recommendations based off what I already like?,"Hey everyone.

I live 45 minutes away from Raleigh in a small city and love visiting Raleigh every other weekend or so. I’m wondering if there are any folks that would be willing to recommend places I visit based off of some of the places I already like going to. 

• Quail Ridge Books
I love love love Quail Ridge. I don’t have a bookstore in the city I live so I often go to Raleigh just to visit Quail Ridge Books. I love books and I like how it’s easy to drive to coming off of 264 and the staff there is always great.

• North Carolina Museum of Art
I’ve come here so many times throughout my life. I love its mission of showcasing voices from all different types of folks, and just looking at the cool art pieces and exhibits. The outdoor walking paths are awesome too. I don’t care too much for crowds, though, so if it’s busy I usually just put in some noise-canceling earbuds and listen to classical music while I walk around. I pretty much know from memory where the different exhibits are at this point and I love buying art history books from the gift shop.

• Pullen Park
I love the community of folks that usually are here. I love parks and walking around so it’s really nice seeing all of the families hanging out. Plus it’s convenient with the cafe and it’s fun riding the train every once in a while. I enjoy resting and pretty much every bench in the park has a pretty view.

• Cowfish
I really like the food and friendly staff here. The only thing I don’t like is the loud noises since it’s usually busy. I have to eat gluten-free too but the options they have still taste very good. Plus it’s nice just to park and then walk to here, especially if you get Kilwin’s afterwards for dessert and take it to Pullen Park. 

• Interests
Social justice, learning about different people and their stories, walking, parks, playing sports, coffee shops and cafes, places to just chill and relax/rest, nature, video games, chess, BLM, lgtbq+, mental health, psychology.

1ilfbuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ilfbuz/hm_eating_ink/,[HM] Eating Ink,"Marta smiled. She recognized the familiar face entering the parking lot.

John was her good friend from college who followed her back home after school ended twelve years ago. They had careers in different professions but always found a way to pal around after hours and on weekends. Over time, they both got in and out of relationships (and became shoulders to cry on due to the inevitable breakups). Eventually, both settled down. John got married to Christine five years ago and moved away up north. Marta still enjoyed her bachelorette lifestyle, if anything, because of the relative freedom it provided her on weekends.

Marta sipped her hazelnut latte slowly and watched as John quickly turned into the lot, running over the curb with his car. John stepped out of the hybrid Honda and walked towards the coffee shop. He smiled wide at the familiar face staring back at him in the window. 

Marta studied her approaching old friend in between sips. He looked about as good as she remembered when she last saw him. Was it Toby's wedding or the ten-year reunion of the business school? She couldn't remember. She stood up before him to greet him. She wore a pair of old jeans that fit her body perfectly. Her shirt, a tasteful sweater thrifted last week, hung high just above the waistband. He walked in and immediately gave her a big hug before saying anything.

""Oh my God, Marta, it's so good to see you!"" John said it loud enough to pique the interest of several individuals in their immediate vicinity. The shop looked especially busy. Every seat in the coffee shop was either taken or reserved. The burly gentleman in a scarf looked up from his laptop in mild disdain, no doubt an interruption to the composure of his remarkable American masterpiece hitting the shelves in 1 to 100 years. Maybe never. 

Marta embraced her old friend back. It felt warm and familiar like an old friend should be. ""John, how long has it been?"" She asked in a rhetorical tone but hoped he knew the answer. 

""It's been a few years. How long was Toby's in North Carolina…three years?"" Three years. She knew it was one of those two things but couldn't remember which came last. 

""Yeah, I guess it has,"" she said. Marta stood staring at John for a second, waiting for him to make the next move. ""Can I get you a cup of coffee?"" He stared back at her awkwardly for a second before responding. He held a hand up to break the silence. 

""Oh, no. Not for me. I already had my two cups today."" 

""I'm sorry, John,"" Marta responded. ""Coffee was your favorite thing. I figured this was a safe bet."" 

""I still do,"" he said. ""You are correct, as always. I try to limit it. Gotta about how it affects my body, you know, and it's in the afternoon."" He chuckled a bit in that signature tone Marta remembered from those late nights in the university library. ""Don't want to stay up all night."" 

""Alright, then,"" she said and sat down. ""Can we sit?"" 

""Sure."" They both sat down. John adjusted himself in his seat. He wished he had taken his coat off. ""So, how are things with you?""

""They're great,"" Marta said. ""I've been busy with work but kinda crushing it,"" John smirked. 

""You were always going to crush it, Marty."" Marty. Nobody since him called her that. She didn't even let her boyfriends call her that. She let it slide. ""You were the one putting in the late hours back in the day when I fucked off to sleep."" 

""Yeah,"" she laughed. ""I guess I did."" She took a sip of her coffee. John stared back, his hands folded. ""I've just been enjoying myself, you know?"" John nodded in agreement. ""How are you and Christine?"" 

John sucked in with his teeth and winced a little. ""Pretty good, you know,"" he said. He looked off in the distance at his car in the parking lot. ""You know how it is, right?"" Marta didn't but nodded anyway. Something about John was off, but she couldn't grasp it. He closed his eyes and continued. ""It's always tough to juggle all the responsibilities as a husband and a manager sometimes. I know I can't be great at both, even if I tried.""

Marta didn't know what to think. Where was the jovial, fun guy who used to dance circles around her when she had too much to drink? This guy was different. She should have noticed something was different from his attire. She didn't think much of his Lands End pullover but would never tell him to his face. She tried to shift the conversation to something he might be interested in. 

""I'm sorry about that with the relationship, John. But you're doing well at work?"" 

""As good as I can at a new firm,"" he said. ""I'm juggling a lot of different contracts that always take up my time. I'm glad I could come back home for the weekend and have this visit, though. I'm surprised my phone isn't ringing off the hook right now–it doesn't matter that it's a Saturday!"" John held his phone up to her like it was some goddamn war trophy. 

Marta was unimpressed but allowed him to continue. She sipped more of her nearly empty drink. She thought about ordering another. ""So I know you aren't seeing anyone now, or at least that's what the 'gram tells me,"" John smirked again. Gone was the signature grin. There was something deeper there. More primal. ""What are you doing to enjoy yourself?"" he emphasized ENJOY. 

Out of ideas already, Marta thought about the last thing she did a few days ago after work. ""Oh, I got a tattoo!"" 

""You? A Tattoo? Marty got a damn tattoo? No way!"" John rubbed his hands through his hair in disbelief. ""What did you get?"" She looked down, almost embarrassed. 

""I got a lily, in honor of my grandmother. Do you remember her? You met her once a long time ago during a Christmas break."" 

""How could I forget her!"" John said it loud enough to raise the head of the coffee shop novelist. ""She was a fantastic woman."" At least he remembered, she thought.

She considered the following words carefully. ""Would you like to see it?"" 

""Where is it?"" John's voice lowered, and his eyes shifted to her legs crossed under the table across from him. 

""It's on my back."" Marta lifted the thrifted sweater slightly to reveal a lily roughly the size of a fist. ""Don't judge me; I just got it, so it's all flaking off. It's got grooves like a record at the moment."" 

""Really? Let me see."" Before she could object, John rubbed his fingers across the tattoo. He felt the raised skin from the fresh ink and returned his hand to him, revealing a small piece of flaked skin where the tattoo ink once was. It was a tiny, square fleck of black that resembled a dash of Morse Code. He must not have noticed Marta looking back from behind because he discretely put the piece of skin in his mouth, made a swallowing motion, and resumed talking. ""It looks great, Marta. I can tell it's a fresh tattoo, for sure."" He leaned back in his seat while she put her sweater down and sat back in her seat. 

Marta took the last sip of her drink and contemplated what to say next. Should she say something or attempt to continue the already awkward conversation?

""John, did you eat a piece of my flaked skin?"" 

John looked at her in a dead stare. The joyful kid from college was gone. He was the bright lights of an approaching vehicle speeding through the night. Nothing was there but quick fury. ""Marta, what the hell are you talking about."" The minor shriek of avoidant laughter made her feel uneasy. Marta set her drink down with a sharp thud. 

""For one, I didn't permit you to put your hands on me."" 

""I thought we were friends,"" he said. He held both hands up in an accusatory tone. ""Excuse me for thinking that."" 

""Don't gaslight me, John. We are friends. That doesn't mean you can rub your fingers across my back without asking."" 

""Fine."" He looked off into the distance again, back at his car. ""I didn't do what you said I did."" 

Her voice grew louder. ""You mean take a piece of flaked skin from my tattoo and eat it? I saw you clear as day. You didn't think I did. Why would you do that? That's so gross."" 

""I didn't do that."" 

""John, I fucking saw you."" 

""So what if I did? Why do you care?"" The tone shifted again. Mr. Great American Novel looked up again and removed his headphones.

""I care because it's fucking gross. Could you not touch me like that, first off? I haven't seen you in years, and the first thing you do within five minutes is eat a piece of my flaked-off skin like it was some fish scale at a sushi restaurant."" 

""Well, when you put it that way…""

""I do put it that way! I haven't seen you since the reunion, and you pull some shit like this."" 

John laughed a little. ""It wasn't the reunion. It was Toby's wedding. You must've not been thinking about me too much there, Marta."" 

""What the fuck does that mean?"" Marta stood back up. ""Am I required to think about you a required amount?"" 

""I would hope a little,"" he said. He didn't seem to care that Marta was halfway through making a scene in the coffee shop. ""I thought we were better friends than that."" 

""Stop saying that! I'm starting to wonder if we ever were. Then you come in here and try to chastise me for forgetting arbitrary things about the past. I just..."" John held up a hand to interrupt her. 

""I'm going to stop you right there before you go further. I didn't come here for you to load into me. I came here because I wanted to see you. I took time out of my busy schedule. From what I've seen online, you'd have plenty of time. The tattoo was a nice touch. I wanted to see it in the flesh."" 

Marta looked at him in disbelief. ""Busy schedule? I haven't heard from you for almost a year, and you come out of nowhere and want to hang out? You're stalking me on Instagram and wanted to see for yourself. 

""Marta, plea…."" Marta threw her nearly empty paper cup at him. Tiny droplets of brown liquid splattered across his new pullover. He thought he'd have to drop this off at the dry cleaner afterward. She moved to slap him but decided against it. 

""I'm leaving. And I saw you hit that curb when you came in. Learn how to drive, asshole!"" She stormed out the door. 

John watched her storm into her car and drive off quickly. He took a napkin left on the table to dab the coffee blotches off him. He looked at the waitress returning to the counter from clearing a nearby table. ""Can I have a coffee, please?""  ",1,1739109683.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Congratulations! If you’re reading this, it means you’ve somehow survived almost two years of IB without spontaneously combusting. Your brain has been marinated in stress, existential dread, and caffeine, and now—like a beautifully overcooked piece of academic roadkill—you are ready for the final showdown.

This is it, my fellow sleep-deprived gremlins. The IB Board Exams are looming over us like a CAS supervisor demanding last-minute reflections. This is the moment we either rise like a phoenix or crash harder than our Wi-Fi during an online test.

And yet, here we are. Broken? Yes. Betrayed by the IB? Absolutely. Ready to destroy these exams? Debatable, but we’re doing it anyway.

So when you step into that exam hall, hold your head high. You have written the EE, faked an entire CAS project, and learned an entire syllabus in one night. You are an academic cockroach—resilient, unkillable, and probably running on your tenth cup of coffee.

This is our Endgame, our Hunger Games, our “I am once again asking for a grade above a 5.”

Good luck, May 2025 IB kids. May your exam papers be easy, your examiners be generous, and your calculators not betray you in Paper 2. We shall rise together.

I've met this girl at our prom night 2 weeks ago as she was helping us with preparations and other stuff.  We then started following eachother on instagram. 

I then asked her out to get coffee and sit down in exchange for her hard work, since she didn't get paid for anything. To be true, I find her really pretty and I just wanted to get to know her. She agreed and (in my opinion) we had a great time. We talked alot, visited a few more places to get food etc. and in total spent like 3 hours together.

We agreed on going out again to a restaurant we both know and now I'm waiting for her to let me know when she's free.

Well, since Valentine's day is next friday I'm not sure if I should even mention it. We don't know eachother very well and I don't want to rush things. I also have no idea what she thinks of me or how she feels. On the other hand, I don't want to miss a chance like this.

We're finally waking up to the whole microplastic and nanoplastic issue and want to control our intake of any unwanted material(s). We found that the K-Cups 'can' leach unwanted microplastics into our coffee. It looks like the primary offender is the plastic cups itself. I think the easy fix is using the metal filters. We've used them before and they were great, but when life gets busy, it's easier to just drop in the plastic pod. Using that filter is going to be our #1 change.

While researching this up, it looks like we have not been cleaning our machine often enough. We typically do the 3-month brewer care kit to descale/clean, but numerous lab tests show potentially harmful mold and bacteria in the lines of the machine. I imagine this is with all coffee machines and not isolated to Keurig. I think the safest remedy is to do a pour over or french press. We'll likely reserve that for a weekend coffee routine, but we want to continue using our Keurig during work days as the convenience is great. Should we be cleaning the pipes of our Keurig more often? Maybe run vinegar through it every week or other week, instead of every 3 months?",1,1739109279.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

We have lived together now for around 6 months and it seems like I am the only one that cares about keeping up on the house. Just last night, it was her night to do the dishes (we all take turns throughout the week) and she threw a fit, in front of her mom even, about how “she didn’t get a day to herself this week” and that “she just wants to relax”. Keep in mind, I already did extra dishes this week and my dish day is tomorrow (any dishes she doesnt do are left for me), as well as my night to cook dinner and meal prep. I also worked overtime this Saturday and went into work at 4am. I work in a factory and she works in a coffee shop and goes to college. She calls it “helping me” when I ask her to do OUR laundry. She gets upset when I am busy and don’t help her do tiny things (for example, she asked me to stop what I was doing to help her fill a mop bucket, I thought this was ridiculous), she never folds laundry, never cleans the bathroom. She won’t even put her clothes in the dirty clothes basket, or put the toilet paper roll back on. I have told her many times we need to figure out a chore chart or a system and she doesn’t seem to care.

Some products and therapies have helped for a day or two, but the heaving and squeezing gut, the bloating, the nausea and insomnia were all back within a day or two.  I dont think I have slept through the night in a decade.  And those sleepless nights have resulted in some very dark thoughts that looking back seem really upsetting.  

But for the last 3 months I have been on a very expensive, but really effective regimen I wanted to post on here for those who are still in search of some sort of relief from this awful disease.  My symptoms are 95% gone (and I mean gone!!) And it has been a full 3 months so I feel like its effective enough to share.  I have been lurking on this forum for years with nothing to share, searching for other people's ideas or concoctions.  Well, I finally found one that seems to work.  Im hoping someone out there, somehwere can find this post and maybe find some relief.... and potentially find some light at the end of this very dark tunnel.  

The regimen:
Morning, 30 minutes before eating anything:
1. FC Cidal
2. Dysbiocide
3. Black coffee or water

Then I make a large Stanley type jug (one of the super sized ones) and I add the following:
1. 2 packets of metamucil
2. One dose of Morning Complete
3. One dose of Dr Amy Myers Leaky Gut
4. One dose Culturelle abdominal support and comfort
5. At least 150K CFU of ANY probiotic capsule, opened up and mixed into the drink
6. Flavoring pack of choice

I mix this up and shake it really well, and brink it with me, drinking it slowly through the day.  It should be the largest volume jug you can find, I think the water content is as important as the ingredients.  

Again, I know everyone's body is different.  But with such a miserable, awful, life-altering syndrome I know there are a few of you out there desperate to try anything.  For me, this has been a miracle.  ",1,1739108641.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

These four specifically had a ton of lore dumps. 

Rarity nightmare moon would’ve introduced us to the ooze nightmare ish servants that Luna had to deal with when she was corrupted, it would also show how her mane and body changed from season 1 to the present flowy star like mane and darker fur. 

The another universe Sombra x Celestia would’ve given us a glimpse of how Celestia was like with star swirl. For some reason star swirl is made up as an asshole in the show when the comics he’s just a goofy old teacher. We could’ve seen another version of Luna. We could’ve seen that ‘coffee’ was actually brought into equestria from another world. 

Redeemed Sombra had a ton of crystal empire lore hidden in it, cousins seen radiant Hope, the first princess of crystal empire Amore. How Sombra was just nurtured to be evil and was a child caught in a horrible curse. 

Cadence and shining armor, they were introduced so suddenly with no hints of their existence. We used to think only Luna and Celestia were existing alicorns then we got hit with the ‘third princess’. I love cadence, even if she didn’t get that much time to shine or see her backstory. Her comic with shining armor back when they were in high school would’ve given us a glimpse of how she and twilight were introduced to each other and became friends.

I want to share my thoughts and see if there are more people who feel the same way I do. I'm 52 years old and I greatly enjoy my solitude. I prefer to spend my time writing, drawing, listening to music, watching movies, and cooking whatever I feel like.

Mimi and I have known each other since primary school, but our friendship got stronger the last 7 years. We've had a very loyal and strong friendship and could rely on each other on anything. Mimi has always been private about her job, she never liked talking about it, never mentioned her colleagues, and ive respected that, never questioned it. There have also been some bad gossips going around for years about Mimi regarding her job, and because i dont believe in gossips since they're not always true, I have always ignored it and never mentioned to Mimi. I knew someone tried to harm Mimis reputation and it was all a lie. For all those years I ignored the gossip and always tried to shut it down whenever someone tried to bring it up. I also come from a place where gossip is very much a ""sport"" and people use it to harm others, they also believe it very easily.

The problem starts when I meet Ava, a colleague from work, same age as me and we hit it off. At first she seems friendly and fun. We start hanging out a lot for months and seem to have a lot in common. She rely's on me on advice and opens up a lot to me, especially about her problematic marriage ( which she apparently doesnt really care about and uses as a victim card to gain peoples trust). Later on, I find out Ava used to work with Mimi in the same institution and it baffles me how Mimi never mentioned it. Anyway, one time as Ava and I went out for drinks, she indirectly mentions something about Mimi (she plays me and I fell for it). I knew at that time that anyone that ever put foot on the institution where Mimi worked, would know about the gossip. So I mention it to Ava and tell her that I know my friend too well to know that it's all a stupid gossip. So the problem here is I mentiong it! ME!!!

Later on, I meet Mimi for coffee and mention Ava to her and ask her why she never mention her. Mimi becomes defensive, tells me to distance myself from Ava and starts telling me the worst things about her. Which she spread around as if I have said those things about Ava(and I havent). It turns out Mimi and Ava have been life long enemies and have been using my name to get to each other. Ava was never my friend and Mimi... well I dont know!  
I was shocked!!! I felt betrayed, used and exposed. I am losing sleep over this. I have distanced myself from both of them and dont know how to fix this.

Despite all this, I also feel immense guilt that I ever said anything to Ava regarding the gossip about Mimi.

In a world aching for authenticity, where the soul craves expression, a revolution is brewing—a rise of freelance jobs that promises not just a paycheck, but freedom. The shackles of traditional employment are crumbling, and in their place, a vibrant tapestry of opportunity is unfurling. Do you hear that? It’s the sound of untethered lives ready to soar.

Imagine waking up each day, not to the blare of an alarm clock, but to the whisper of your own dreams. That is the heartbeat of the freelance life. It’s the exhilarating jolt of taking the reins of your destiny. You are not just a cog in a machine; you are the artisan of your own path, carving out a niche that reflects your unique gifts. It’s raw. It’s real. It is the very essence of what it means to live abundantly.

Why wait for permission? The traditional nine-to-five myth is fading. Flexibility isn’t just a perk; it’s a necessity. The modern workforce demands adaptability. A staggering 36% of the workforce is now involved in freelancing, according to recent studies. Why? Because people are waking up to the reality that they can monetize their passions and skills from anywhere—living rooms, coffee shops, or beachside hammocks. This is not just a trend; it’s a transformational shift.

But let’s talk about fear; it looms large, casting shadows over dreams. What if you fail? What if you falter? Let the truth be your shield. Every titan of industry was once a novice; every expert was once a beginner. Embrace the struggle; it is the crucible where you’ll forge resilience. Every “no” is a step closer to your “yes,” and within each rejection lies a lesson waiting to be learned. You have the power to redefine success on your own terms.

And then there’s the heart of freelancing—connection. It’s not just you against the world; it’s a thriving community of like-minded souls, each contributing their light. Collaborate, network, build relationships. Leverage platforms that put you in touch with clients who value your talents. Websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer are not just marketplaces; they are gateways to a new life. Open those doors.

You don’t need a degree or a long resume. What you need is passion, initiative, and the courage to stand up and say, “Here I am!” Today’s world is built on innovation, and freelancers are the pioneers of this digital frontier. Compete with creativity, wield your unique voice like a sword, and let it resonate with the very core of your being.

Seek mastery in your craft. The world doesn’t just want good enough; it wants extraordinary. Invest in your skills, take online courses, attend workshops, and immerse yourself in the latest trends. The more value you offer, the higher your worth. This isn’t just about survival; it’s about thriving in a world that rewards those willing to push boundaries.

Every step toward your freelance journey is a step deeper into self-discovery. Tap into your spiritual essence; the joy of creation is divine. When you pour your heart into your work, you step into a realm where your efforts transform lives, inspire hearts, and illuminate paths. Your work is your ministry; let it flow from the deepest well of your soul.

So, rise up, ignite that fire within! Free yourself from mediocrity. Don’t merely exist; thrive, like the wildflowers that bloom in the cracks of concrete. The world is waiting for your gifts. The courage to choose this path brings with it challenges, yes, but it also births fulfillment beyond your wildest dreams.

Step into the unknown with boldness. You are meant to create, to inspire, to delight the world with your unique offerings. Choose freedom. Choose freelance. Choose a life that echoes with purpose, ripe with potential, resonating with the symphony of your soul. The dawn of a new era is here—embrace it, own it, and let it transform the very fabric of your existence.

Instead of hosting a traditional wedding, we're gathering our favorite people for a camping weekend the first weekend of October. Yep, we've traded formal wear for flannel and table settings for trail mix - and we couldn't be more excited! Most of our crew is flying in from the West Coast and we're beyond excited to show off the magic of Duluth and Lake Superior in fall. 

We're looking to add some extraordinary touches to make this weekend unforgettable - unique touches like a:

* Mobile sauna rental for post-adventure bliss
* Local coffee cart for misty morning brew
* Acoustic musician for fireside sessions

But we know Duluth has so many more hidden gems! We're particularly interested in:

* Ways to create magical moments throughout the weekend
* Cool experience rentals we might not know about
* Unique local vendors/artists who could add something special
* Your favorite spots for breathtaking fall views
* Ideas for making group meals feel extra special
* Activities that would be unexpected and delightful
* Your Duluth must do's when bringing first-timers

We're open to splurging on a few special elements that would really make the weekend unforgettable. No idea is too out there - we want this to feel like the ultimate celebration of Duluth in autumn!

Has anyone done something similar or been to an event like this? What made it memorable? What do you wish you'd done? We'd love to hear any and all recommendations!

I (28m) went on a date with an inexperienced woman (23f) yesterday. When she got to the crowded place and greeted me, she seemed very tired, unimpressed, low energy, almost mad. I was a little ticked because I had blown off another date for this one that seemed to have more potential. So I ask if she is hungry, tired etc. like what’s the problem here. She had just come from work and would break eye contact. I suggested we go to a quiet coffee shop instead. We walk to one, get coffees and a snack. We found a place more private and she explained she was very anxious when seeing me and it was loud in the last place, and opened up a lot more. Then she started touching me with her leg as we were seated beside each other, and I thought, oh, *now* you want to be nice. Then we talked more. Then she grabbed my hand. It felt natural. She starts complimenting me. We talked and had a lot in common and I was joking around a bit. The place closed so we went to a brewery. We had 1 beer. There my knee was basically all the way between her legs, again we were side by side holding hands. I ended the date after 3 hours and she texted me at night. She said thank you, she appreciated me for being patient, and that I was calm, and had a comforting aura, and started asking me about 2nd dates. Then she texted at 3 am she could not sleep.

We both arrived ten minutes early—because being on time always felt like being late.

She showed up in a vibrant floral pink top with jeans, while I sat there in a lifeless gray hoodie and sweatpants.

She told me how misunderstood she felt at home, and I chuckled and thought to myself—some things never change.

She asked if things would work out after growing up, and I tightened my grip on my purse, making sure she wouldn’t catch a glimpse of the antidepressants inside.

She poured extra sugar into her coffee, stirring it in slow, deliberate circles. I watched the swirls form, thinking about how the world kept spinning, never once stopping for us—how she kept turning with it, while I just stood still.

She had her problems, but she still held onto something I let slip through my fingers—hope.

I wanted to hug her, to tell her to slow down, to hold on to the moment. Because she didn’t know yet.

However, after a few hours, streaks start to appear that normally wouldn’t on regular windows.

For the past month, my diet has mainly consisted of frozen pizza and large amounts of coffee/yerba mate. A few days ago, I experienced a panic attack after taking my meds, and then had another strange one the following day. During the second attack, I heard an overwhelming hiss in my ear, which made me extremely anxious and felt like a blood vessel had popped in my head. I checked my blood pressure, and it was alarmingly high at 190/150.

I contacted a doctor friend who told me the hissing was likely due to high blood pressure. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist in three days, so I discussed this with them. They confirmed it was a panic attack and prescribed Benzo if it happens again, but I'm scared of taking adhd meds even when i know i have Benzo on hand. The hissing was one of the most terrifying experiences I've ever had—I literally thought I was done.

I've since stopped consuming coffee and taking my meds, but with exams approaching, I'm finding it difficult to focus or do anything without them. My psychiatrist also prescribed antidepressants, but I'm unsure if I want to start them. Everything was fine until the panic attacks began, and I've been on antidepressants before. They take a long time to work, and withdrawing from them is also a lengthy process. I'm not sure if I need them right now.

My current blood pressure is 117/85, which is within a normal range, but I'm worried it'll spike again. I desperately need to pass these exams, but I'm feeling lost. What should I do? Help",1,1739107257.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1ilejji,https://v.redd.it/a3w98ivg64ie1,Brakes failing on my e46,"So, my e46 has had increasingly brake problems for a few months. And i can’t really tell what’s wrong. Theres no threads about this kind of problem anywhere that i could find but i know some of you will figure this out.

The problems started about 2-3 months ago when one night the abs, dsc and brake light came on when i was driving home. I shut the car and started it again and the lights were gone.

Then the lights started appearing randomly and turning off when i turned the car off and on again. The lights always appeared when it was moist outside (raining, snowy or the roads were wet) 

Then one night when i was leaving a parking lot the brake pedal was completely hard when pushing it like 20% of its range to the floor. The pedal started vibrating back to my foot and the car made this noise (which can be heard from the video) when pushing the pedal. Also it felt like 80% of the power of the brakes were gone. I drove around the parking lot a few times and the problem seemed to go away. 2-5 minutes later the same abs dsc and brake light appeared.

The car has done the same hardpedalweakbrakes thingy to me like 6-8 times but ive always managed to control the car till the brakes appear again. 

Now a new problem has appeared. The car accelerates independently when the break problem is about to happen. Not like full throttle but like light throttle that the rev gauge goes up and down for a bit (in the other video you can see the car completely independently accelerating that the fuel consumption gauge shows the car consuming 10L/100km without me pressing the gaspedal) 

The issue always comes on for about a minute or two but always dissapears after that. And then the lights come on. What could be the problem? My own guess is that theres water in my brakefluid and the cold Finnish weather freezes that water which causes the brakes to fail. For a moment till the heat from the motor melts the ice and the car continues normally. Or my brake booster is just simply shot. Ive checked my brakefluids and no ice seems to be floating around and theres the correct amount of it.

The problem appears oftenly when the car has been parked for a while (stopping for a coffee or going to the shop) sometimes the problem comes when the car has been driven for a while (1-3h)

1ilej2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ilej2e/ninja_dualbrew_pro_cfp201_review_a_coffee_maker/,Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP201 review – a coffee maker with versatility and style,"I’ve been using the Ninja DualBrew Pro Specialty Coffee Machine, model CFP201, for several months now, and it’s safe to say my coffee routines have never been this exciting. This machine has become a staple in my kitchen—not just for me but for my coffee-loving family. Whether it’s a hot morning brew or a refreshing iced coffee in the afternoon, this device delivers. While it’s undeniably a solid performer, there are a few quirks worth noting.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The design of the Ninja CFP201 truly caught my eye the moment I unboxed it. Its sleek black finish brings a modern aesthetic to my countertop. At 11.18”D x 9.09”W x 15.4”H, it’s compact enough to fit comfortably without hogging all the counter space. The materials feel sturdy, and the overall build quality suggests durability. I’ve moved it around a few times for cleaning purposes, and it feels steady and well-constructed. However, the plastic components, like the carafe lid and certain inner parts, do feel less premium than the rest of the machine.

**Brewing Performance**  
The Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP201 really shines when it comes to brewing versatility. It offers settings for classic, rich, and iced coffee, and you can use either ground coffee or K-Cup pods. I’m someone who likes experimenting with different blends, so this flexibility is a huge plus. I find the speed of brewing impressive, especially when guests are over. For instance, it brews a full 12-cup carafe quickly without compromising on the flavor. Single-serve options are equally efficient, making my busy mornings less stressful.

[Want DualBrew Pro CFP201 pricing? Check Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/ninja-cfp201-coffee-maker-review-b08qzxfskp/)

**Coffee Flavor**  
I’ll admit, I’m a bit of a coffee snob. The flavor from the Ninja CFP201 didn’t disappoint. The “classic” setting produces a smooth, balanced cup, while the “rich” setting delivers a stronger, more robust flavor. My teenage son swears by the iced coffee setting, saying it’s as good as the drinks he gets at popular coffee chains. The temperature of the coffee is perfect—hot enough to enjoy without scalding your tongue. That said, I did notice that the flavor can vary slightly depending on the ground coffee or pod brand you use, but that’s hardly the machine’s fault.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning this machine is mostly hassle-free, thanks to features like the removable water reservoir and the auto-clean function. The reservoir design makes refilling and washing simple, but the carafe can be a bit tricky to clean due to its narrow opening. I’ve also learned (the hard way) that leaving used pods in the machine can create a mess, so I make it a habit to remove them immediately. Descaling is straightforward, and the machine even reminds you when it’s time to clean.

**Pros**

* Offers excellent brewing versatility for both K-Cups and ground coffee.
* Compact design with a modern aesthetic.
* Produces consistent coffee flavor with customizable strength options.
* Fast brewing for single-serve and full carafe.
* Easy-to-use programmable settings and auto-clean function.

**Cons**

* Some plastic components feel less durable.
* Carafe design makes thorough cleaning a bit challenging.
* Requires specific reusable pods for K-Cup brewing, which aren’t included.
* Iced coffee setting works well but can be slightly watered down if not adjusted properly.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to the Keurig K-Elite, the Ninja CFP201 offers more versatility with its ability to brew both carafes and single cups. While Keurig machines are known for their ease of use, they often lack the robust flavor options that Ninja provides with its “rich” setting. The Breville Bambino Plus is another competitor, excelling in espresso but lacking the Ninja’s multi-use capability. Ninja’s ability to brew iced coffee is a standout feature that many competitors don’t offer or don’t execute as well. However, Keurig’s pod variety remains unmatched, and some users may prefer Breville’s higher-end materials.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Though it’s not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, the Ninja CFP201 justifies its price with its range of features and consistent performance. It’s like having multiple machines in one—drip coffee maker, single-serve brewer, and iced coffee machine. While you can find budget options with similar basics, they often lack the Ninja’s durability and versatility. Investing in this machine feels worthwhile, especially for households with diverse coffee preferences.

**Features and Settings**  
This coffee maker is loaded with thoughtful features. The 60-oz removable water tank is convenient, and the programmable settings allow me to set up my morning brew the night before. The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours, and the machine also has an auto-shutoff feature for safety. The option to use reusable pods is a big win for eco-conscious users like me. Additionally, the included water filter ensures a purer taste, although I recommend using filtered water for optimal flavor.

I regret not traveling more in my 20s and sometimes feel like I wasted them. Can you find purpose beyond the ‘see the world’ mindset?","I understand why traveling is amazing—I love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures too. However, recently, I’ve gotten caught up in this pressure to travel as much as possible, as if it’s the only way to truly live. I started feeling like I haven’t done enough and that I wasted my 20s because I never backpacked through SE Asia, volunteered abroad, or lived a nomadic lifestyle.

I even started feeling sorry for my parents and grandparents because they didn’t travel much, as if that meant they wasted their lives. But when I talked to my grandfather about it, he told me something that really made me think. He said that, for him, traveling often felt lonely, and he eventually found peace in the simple things—going fishing, drinking his morning coffee, just being present in his daily routine. He admitted he doesn’t have many “big stories” to tell, but chasing them never made him happy. He realized his life was meaningful in a different way.

Now, at 28, I’m questioning all of this. Have I really “wasted” my 20s just because I didn’t travel a certain way? Is the pressure to experience as much as possible actually making me feel less fulfilled? I still want to travel, volunteer, and explore, but I’m also trying to figure out how much of this desire is truly mine and how much is just societal pressure.

Has anyone else struggled with this? How do you find the balance between wanting adventure and appreciating the life you have? And if you felt like you hadn’t traveled “enough” in your 20s, how did you move forward?",3,1739107079.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

I still have some questions if you don't mind answering me. 

Why did you tell me thoses things

As in the reason why we kinda broke up (not that I'm being weird I just you avoided the question when we talked and you said it was anger but 
I doubt it what you said was how you feel) 

Why didn't you want to send me text when I was at work you said ""it wasn't worth it""

 I know it sounds petty but I thought it would be nice since my colleagues at the time their partners didn't mind texting. I always wanted you to call or text me. I always made sure to text you through out my shift but you didn't like it.


I still don't mind drinking a cup of coffee with you.

1ilegxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1ilegxc/resurecting_a_converted_schoolie/,Resurecting a converted schoolie...,"Yesterday...

Awake with the sun as usual. Not necessarily out of bed, but awake. Reddit. Time for coffee. Didn't know where everybody in the house stood on coffee. Figured if there's a coffee pot I might as well make a full pot. Worked out. Two of us polished it off before we left. A bit of concentrate for good measure. Today's project? Get a converted school bus running.

We hunt down every filter we can find, five gallons of oil, a couple new batteries. I had pulled every number I could find off the bus the day before. I give the parts guy the VIN number. (If you can't get us the right parts with that, there's no hope for you.)

Out to where the bus is parked. I climb under the bus. Drain the couple gallons of oil that's in it out. Drain plug back in and tightened. Crack loose the nearest filter. 'This has got to be the oil filter.' I'll be the first to admit I'm not a diesel mechanic, but they all burn fuel and spit exhaust. I held an L1 at one time wihich means Master Technician. Anyone who says, ""I don't work on -insert, fuel injection, imports, computer controlled fuel systems, diesels, or any other new automotive technology since the 70s,
-"" shouldn't be working on anything automotive anyway. It's all the same shit. Don't be a pussy because you ran into something new. Filter loosened.

'This appears to be water... Nope, it diesel fuel.' Tighten it back up. Look around under bus. Have dude trace various hoses coming from the four other similar looking  filters surrounding the bottom of the engine because I can't see where they end up from down here. A couple minutes later I figure we have it licked. 'These are for turbo intercooler. That one is transmission, that one has to be power steering. This one has to be oil.' 

That one was welded on. I spent probably fourty five minutes with two flat blade screwdrivers and a hammer getting that stuck filter off the engine. Found out when I pierced it the first time... You guessed it. Not the oil filter. We even talked about going to the autoparts store for an oil filter wrench. We were on our way when I gave it one last try for twenty minutes. Gotcha bitch!

By now all the coolant has been drained out into a container. I can see where someone tried to get this filter off before and ran into the same problem. 'This thing's king fu is not strong enough for me.' Out of the two filters we bought and one we might have found on the bus one of them happens to be the replacement for this filter I've just destroyed taking it off. 

Due to an unscheduled fireworks show at the battery compartment, and the usual, you're never gonna get everything you need for a automotive project the first time, we make a brief list and are slowly making our way for the car. 

Dude while at the car, ""Come take a look at this.  You gotta see this."" I walk over. Look at a toolbox with the lid open that we've both been into today. Recently I might add.

A brand new, still in the package, oil filter wrench. Not buried under any tools. Right on top. In all it's bright red and black glory. 

We laughed our asses off at that. It's still funny at 6:00am the next morning. 😆😆😆

After pondering what I've seen being all over this engine and transmission, and doing a bit of climbing around under this bus tracing things, I determine, 'It's gotta be just a screen and a magnet in the pan. This thing is 35 years old. That's about the time we started changing a bunch of things, but not everybody was on board yet.' It was the wild west in those days automotive-wise. The old guys were telling me stuff like, ""American cars will never be metric."" 

Dude says his son replaced all the filters and fluids before he drove it here. I think we'll be fine without changing the -still not located- oil filter for this trip. Off to the auto parts store. Coolant. Electrical tape. Funnel. Paper towels and hand cleaner. Out. Back to the bus.

I can tell you that coolant system holds four and a half  gallons of fluid. We didn't bring that much so I top it off with water. Some coolant in there will keep the pump lubed, and hopefully keep any dissimilar metals from creating electrolysis and corroding the engine from the inside. We should be good. 

We pour five gallons of oil in it. A little over full but that's not gonna hurt anything. I figure one battery is for the engine the second one, now out of commission due to the previously mentioned fireworks, is for the 'house lights' as they're called. A couple quick checks. Dude goes to fire the engine up...

Second try the engine comes to life. Fires right up. In the first few seconds I can hear that this engine is in great shape. It purrs like a kitten. I walk around the bus listening for air leaks in the braking system. None. All is well. Eventually my ears adjust and I can hear the air compressor cycling. Another good sign.

We let it run for a good twenty minutes, half hour. Check the transmission fluid. It looks like it's right were it should be. Check for any leaks... All good. No leaks. We decide to shut it off.

Deisels don't have any spark igniting fuel. It literally fires due to the fuel being compressed in the cylinders until it explodes. A diesel will run until it runs out of fuel or the air supply gets choked off.

He turns the key to off. Nothing. Still running. I go on the assumption that it probably has an electric fuel pump. I know this is fifty-fifty. So I climb all over this thing disconnecting main power branches. Battery disconnected. Still running. Alternator disconnected. Still running. Power distribution block disconnected. Still running. I've done a bit of studying up on the diesel in my boat since I'm gonna have to rebuild it. 'There's gotta be a fuel cut off lever somewhere.'

I search the engine. Find the throttle cable. Above it is another cable. I reach in, move lever the cable is attached to. 

Success! The engine dies. We get our act together and head for home. It's been all day with this thing.

Today will be fuel and making sure all the required lights work. Probably a bit of window cleaning, and then sneaking down back roads to get it home. Tire pressure for good measure. 

I hear work boots. Time to get this show on the road..",11,1739106963.0,vagabond,1,0.93,False

My anxiety is all time high.,"I'm in my early 30s and got officially diagnosed and tested with PCOS last year. My periods have been incredibly regular for 4-6 days since I was 11 when I got my menarche. Cycle length was 25 to 30 days in between.

No BC prescribed as my husband and I are trying for the past 7yrs. I also lost weight from 81kg to 71kg since the official diagnosis. I have been eating healthy and exercising (not high intensity) as much as I can.


My last regular period was June 2024 and it lasted the usual 6 days. After that, no periods until August. I spotted in between. Timeline of my irregular periods are:

Aug 28- Sept 2 (6days with spotting in between)
Oct 18- 28 (11 days)
Nov 28- Dec 11 (14days and spotting in between)
Jan 10- Feb 1 (23 days)
I got light spotting yesterday, Feb 8 and now in Feb 9 I am bleeding again.


Quality of my blood flow is heavy with clots for a week and very light yet long afterwards. I am so scared but since the year started, I have been in an extremely stressful situations in my work which is nightshift and finances (getting all my inheritance papers sorted out). My sleep is out of whack because I'm thinking of money and work. Life has been overwhelming with me.


I got another consultation with my ob-gyn and is scheduled for another round of tests this Wednesday (scheduled). I'm at the coffee shop right now crying because of fear why my period came back. My husband has been here with me througout this, offering his support and understanding.


I just want this off my chest. I wonder if anyone of you here (sharing is much appreciated) are on a similar boat as me and if you overcome it, how?

No the last time we spoke was the night you ended it. I remember trembling, like my the world was ending right there. Cracking and exploding into a million pieces. I remember how sore my cheeks wore from crying, how wet my face was too. My eyes hurt because I wanted to cry but could not. I used them all up, boogers even started comming down my nose. I remember saying I hope this is not the last time we will talk. How we both shuttered at the thought, but now I know it will be. 

You never showed how you felt aside from fear, you were scared I would hate you. That I would do something like stalk you or something else crazy. I never would of course but given your dating history I understand your fear fully. I hope I am on the good side of that history.

The last time we talked I was broken into a million parts, a perfectly fine version of me was shattered that day. You never said your reason, you just disapeared. Left. Without a reason or a why. And now I think and look back, and when I do my face almost gets the exact same. The trembling isn't there, but my face contorts the same way. The pain, confusion, anguish, all of it comes back to my face. Sometimes I want to text you, beg for some sort of closure even if its some stupid coffee thing that brings no such thing; just so I can have a different moment that was our last. But I won't do that. Not because of hatred towards you or something like that, but because I hate that we ended. I wanted to be yours forever, I meant it each time. But I guess that just was not our fate, and I think I have to accept that at some point. For now, I just will wait. 

I would rather be alone than love another soul while your eyes and smile are in my mind with that giggle you have that still sends butterflies into my stomach.

1ile8q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ile8q9/450_matches_in_three_years/,450 Matches in Three Years,"450 Matches in Three Years

Hello,

I’m in my mid-20s and I’ve been active on various dating platforms in an urban area in Germany for over three years, with a detailed profile and numerous photos. My 450 matches (strictly speaking, a little more than 450) are spread across all major apps, without needing to name them explicitly. On some dating platforms, one could debate what counts as a “match.”

ii. Asymmetry Between Men and Women

Following discussions here on Reddit, I notice a clear disparity in how men and women are treated. Women often receive encouragement when sharing their dating experiences, while men immediately hear: “Work on yourself first.” This somehow implies that women inherently have more ""value"" than men. Or how else should one interpret it?

iii. Looks, Looks, Looks

After more than three years of dating and not a single meeting, I’ve had enough. It’s only about looks—and even looking good isn’t enough. A man has to look perfect. The feedback I’ve received from women has ranged from accusations that I’m too ugly, too dumb, or even the absurd claim that I’m violent. Keep in mind, this was without ever having the chance to meet these people for even a coffee.

iv. Self-Reflection

I’ve reflected on and analyzed my chats. At first, I thought the problem was me. By now, I’ve realized that education, titles, or personality often don’t matter at all. No matter what I write, some women can, with absolute certainty, claim things like, “You don’t understand me.”

Here are my key observations:

	1	Slow Replies, Lack of Initiative, and Empty ConversationsMany matches take weeks, months, or even years to reply. When a message does come, it’s often short, without follow-up questions or real interest. And when we do chat, it’s mostly me doing the talking while I receive the occasional response as a favor. I can’t recall anyone ever voluntarily asking me a deeper question. No, on the contrary—cashiers and employers have asked me more personal questions than I ever got from women.

	2	One-Sided Conversations and MisunderstandingsI often carry most of the conversation alone. Hardly anyone asks follow-up questions or shows genuine interest. When I try to bring up deeper topics—whether about books or personal interests—misunderstandings frequently arise. Interestingly, the women who claim they love to read tend to have a surprisingly narrow understanding of the literary canon.

	3	Ghosting, Short Replies, and Lack of RejectionsI’ve made countless attempts to send first messages with more substance than just “Hi.” Yet, I’ve been ghosted time and again. Additionally, I’ve noticed an extremely brief writing style among women: they are genuinely capable of replying to longer messages with just a few syllables—so few that I could count them on two hands. I realize that “ghosting” might not be the perfect term here, but I can’t think of a better one. It’s completely fine if someone isn’t interested, but women could at least put in the effort to write a simple “No.”

	4	Superficial Connections and Lack of InterestIt often feels like many people are just swiping out of boredom. Matches happen without any real interest in conversation. The whole thing feels like flipping through a catalog with no deeper engagement.

	5	Problems Beyond AlgorithmsSome argue that bad algorithms cause frustration on dating apps. But once a match has already happened, the algorithm no longer plays a role. Particularly on platforms like OkCupid and Hinge, it becomes clear: the interaction afterward goes nowhere.

	6	Disrespectful Rejections and the Myth of the Premium VersionI have no problem with someone not being interested—that’s absolutely fine. What bothers me is how rejections are often handled—namely, not at all. Instead of a short, respectful response, I’m simply ignored or ghosted. Regarding “premium versions,” some say I should be grateful to even have so many matches. But what good are 450 matches if they don’t result in a single date? To me, there’s no reason to spend money when the free version already doesn’t work.

	7	Unfair Accusations and Distorted PerceptionsPeople often claim that men “just swipe right” without being selective. I can confidently deny that for myself. I made an effort to be intentional in my choices and personalize my messages. But how am I supposed to write personalized messages when the average woman’s profile only says something like “I like coffee”—often misspelled? Still, men are often automatically blamed. Additionally, I get the impression that the dating market functions fundamentally differently for men and women. When I see the types of women who have children, I have to objectively conclude that a man with a similar physical appearance would never get a date.

Conclusion

After more than three years, I’ve decided to quit dating—both online and offline. Even in real life, with so-called “cold approaches” (e.g., direct interaction), I’ve found that while I can get a phone number, the woman never actually follows up.

My experiences show that for most men, dating is a hopeless endeavor—even when they put in above-average effort. I hope these observations help others to better contextualize their own experiences—and perhaps use their time more wisely.

Postscript: I was advised to post this in other subreddits. No, I am not wallowing in self-pity. I have simply tried to describe my experiences with the world.

I know some men go their whole lives without never having sex, never receiving a compliment, or so much as a look. I've been told numerous times that I'm handsome, attractive, etc... but I cannot, I just can't believe that's something that's true when I'm treated the way that I am, like I'm not even a person. I know I'm just a drop in the ocean of men that face the same thing, but I'm truly starting to believe that the universe or God truly intends for me to be alone, and I just don't want that kind of life. The 1 thing I've prized above all and have sought after, even after it has devastated me was companionship, love, intimacy, reciprocation, belonging. I guess I'm what you call a ""nice guy"". I try an treat people the way I would want them to treat me, I show respect until I'm given a reason not to, I'm courteous, thoughtful, and try to leave things in a better way than I found them. I'm not saying this to portray myself as some kind of saint, I'm not, and I haven't always been such a well-adjusted, chill dude. I'm kind of just type vomiting now and not really getting to the point of why I even decided to write this. I've struggled with MDD, Anxiety, C-PTSD, and diagnosed with other mental shit I can't even recall right now since I was a child. I'm tired. I'm genuinely tired. Exhausted. 

This recent event is for sure what's helped me decide that I no longer want to do life anymore.
I met this woman on Hinge, we matched, exchanged a few messages detailing and explaining what we want and are looking for in a partner. Everything matches up, we exchange #s and plan to meet. I live 1hr away from her, she's a single mother raising her 12yr old son. I've been very adamant about not wanting children of my own due to having a congenital heart condition and all of the mental illnesses I suffer from. This was discussed prior to us meeting. We were initially set to have a coffee date, grab some dunkin and just get to know each other and see how we feel. I was late leaving so she invited me over to her house instead for a smoke session and meet-n-greet. I make the trip knowing I'll  have to drive back the same night, she even acknowledges and thanks me for making the effort. The night was fantastic, so fantastic she invited me over again the following night. I of course agree. 2nd date night is a bit more intimate, we have sex and from my understanding  it was phenomenal for her. She legit came so many times on me we had to keep stopping. You can't fake bodily responses, and she was telling me how much she enjoyed it. I didn't finish once, and we fucked 4 times that night. I was fine with not finishing because she seemed completely satisfied, tapped out forreal and I genuinely liked her. I leave that night around 3:30am. The next day we talk and she says she doesn't want to have sex again because it something she's always done to bond with someone in a relationship and she wants to do this differently. I agree with her, tell her I'm perfectly fine with not having sex so long as we can still be intimate and build on affection, and that she can initiate sex. 
Her reply to this was: ""Are you mad?"" 
My reply: ""What? Because of the sex thing? I think it's a great idea. Had you said something like no intimacy or affection we'd have had a problem""
We plan our 3rd consecutive date, she invites me over. She again acknowledges the time and effort I've put in, she explains to me that all of her previous relationships have left her in positions of male and female, and this is the first time she feels taken care of and provided for. 
I tell her: ""You know I work remotely, if you're cool with it I could bring my laptop, and I won't have to worry about the drive back""
She's all for it, agrees to it. Gist of it: I spend an impromptu weekend with her and her son. Everything goes amazingly well. She initiated sex during my stay, I didn't finish, she came multiple times. Sunday comes and I need to get back to my crib, I need an ""everything shower"" and some time enjoying my own hobbies. She expresses she'd like to spend time with her kid since we've been hanging out, and he's even made some remarks like ""is he still here?""
We have a great parting, I ask when she wants to link again. She says Tuesday or Wednesday. Bet.
We had been communicating regularly, Sunday evening was the only gap we had not communicating, and I hit her up later that evening before going to bed. She asks what happened between that gap and me hitting her up later in the evening, and I explain to her that I was giving her space and time with her child, because she said she wanted to spend time with her CHILD, and I didn't want to interrupt that. She replies by complimenting how thoughtful and sweet that was of me. Tuesday comes and I'm kinda itching to see her, she explains some important meeting popped up at work, new changes, she's the manager so she's got real shit to deal with at work and doesn't want to be up late ""blah blah"" reasonable excuse. I told her I knew it was a longshot, but I wanted to ask anyway because I really wanted to see her. Wednesday is our planned date time. I get off work and hit her up, she tells me shes getting her nails done and isnt sure how long its going to take, she says she will keep me updated. She does, sends pics, but never acknowledges our planned date time, and doesnt try to setup another time for us. I'm noticing our communication has become infrequent and I'm feeling the dynamic between us shifting, so I communicate this. I express to her that I don't know what I've done, but I've been in situations like this before and I know how those have ended for me in the past, so I'm gonna fall back. She doesn't reply for hours, so I already know what's up. 
She finally replies later in the evening with: ""I'll be honest, you did absolutely nothing wrong! I don't know how to behave when someone is genuinely kind to me, I tend to self sabotage because that's what I know. It has nothing to do with you! Promise!""
I know I haven't done a great job detailing this event, but I'm legit traumatized from this, I cannot begin to fathom what went wrong. I'm an overthinker. I think, a lot, too much for my own good. There's nothing for me to say. 
I replied: ""Cool"" ""That's a real cop out, but you do you. I'm at least glad you're doing this now.""

My last gf was my senior yr of high-school, the relationship lasted all of 3 months. I'd know this girl for 4yrs prior to us dating, she was my best friend. She had been wanting to date me for yrs. She talks to my cousin behind my back while we were dating... I'm 34 now. Single. Decent job. I'm a homebody. I have an athletic build that I maintain. The woman detailed here in this post is 37. I can't do this anymore man. Maybe I'm just weak, but I know 1 thing. I've genuinely thought this out, I'm very content with my life's experiences. If life is just a cycle of shit being dogshit terrible, to finally having a taste of what I've been desperately seeking, and then being abruptly pulled back into dogshit terrible. I'm cool, man. I don't want to keep feeling like this all the time. I don't know, I've found posting here can be therapeutic. I was in dark place last year where I'd been mulling on my ideation. I'm as rational and clear of mind as ever, and I just don't want to life anymore. My passive ideation is no longer passive. I've been spending my money pretty frivolously lately, splurging on friends, splurging on the woman and her kid. I'm going to spend and give all my money away, and then just dip. Go somewhere I won't be found or bother people. I'm okay with my decisions, because I've come to the conclusion of not want to hurt like this anymore. I appreciate anyone who decided to read this vomit of a post. It may very well be the only thing I leave behind, or maybe this will be something I can look back on and say it made me even stronger, that despite the bullshit ""I'm still here."" But I gotta say, that's not likely the move.

Anyway, thanks for those who've read this to it's entirety, and to those who've had similar experiences. It's tough trying to accurately express this shit because there's just so much information you as a reader will never have, and it's easy telling someone to ""keep going"" but I'm done. I'm content. I want nothing on this earth but to stop hurting, and that is within my power. The 1 thing I have real immediate power over.

Bengaluru can be a lonely city. It’s full of people, but real connections? Hard to find. That’s why I want to build something small and simple—no grand billion-dollar plans, just genuine, fun experiences where people can meet, eat, and enjoy themselves.

The idea? Fun dinner parties and restaurant-themed challenges.

Imagine this: You’re at Café Noir, taking on the French Feast Challenge. Participants must complete a four-course meal inspired by four French cities within a set time (say, 30-45 minutes).

 **Starter:** A dish from Paris (e.g., French Onion Soup)  
 **Main Course:** A dish from Lyon (e.g., Coq au Vin)  
 **Dessert:** A dish from Nice (e.g., Tarte Tropézienne)  
 **Drink:** A classic café beverage (e.g., Café Noir’s signature coffee or a French soda)

**The Twist?** The fastest finisher wins the **“Café Noir Champion”** card, getting free coffee for a month and a feature on Café Noir’s social media.

And that’s just one of many experiences. Whether it’s themed dinners, quirky challenges, or just a space for people to meet over good food, the goal is simple: **help people connect, without the awkwardness of dating apps or networking events.**

I just want to have fun doing this and create something people actually enjoy. No pressure, no corporate nonsense—just great food, great company, and memorable nights.

1ile3d1,https://v.redd.it/w45t2zg024ie1,Breakfast: The Most Important Meal or Just Clever Marketing?,"Spoiler: It’s not a hard-boiled truth—it’s just a soft scramble of marketing and tradition.

Introduction: A Truth Worth Questioning
We’ve all heard it: “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” This phrase is so ingrained in our culture that it feels like universal wisdom. But what if this beloved mantra is less about health and more about... selling you cereal?

Let’s crack this open and separate the scrambled facts from sunny-side-up fiction.

The Origins of the Breakfast Myth
You might think this concept has solid scientific roots, but its history is more marketing than metabolism. In the late 19th century, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg—yes, the Kellogg you’re thinking of—was on a mission to promote his cornflake-based cure for digestive issues.

By the 20th century, cereal companies had taken his idea and run with it, spinning the “most important meal” narrative into gold. Advertisements tied breakfast to productivity, energy, and good health—often using company-funded studies to back up these claims. It was less about science and more about selling sugary flakes.

What Science Really Says
1. Metabolism Myths Debunked
One of the most common claims is that breakfast jump-starts your metabolism. However, research shows that your body’s thermic effect of food—the energy used to digest meals—isn’t bound to a morning schedule. Your metabolism doesn’t need a clock-in time to do its job.

2. Weight Loss and Breakfast
The idea that skipping breakfast makes you gain weight is shaky at best. While some studies suggest breakfast eaters are slimmer, this is often due to their overall healthier habits—not breakfast itself. Meanwhile, approaches like intermittent fasting, which often skip breakfast, have shown promise in weight loss and improving metabolic health.

3. Energy and Focus
Does skipping breakfast leave your brain in a fog? Not necessarily. Research shows that mental performance depends more on what you eat, not when you eat it. A nutrient-rich meal at any time of day is what truly fuels your focus—not a sugary bowl of cereal.

Nuances to Consider
Individual Variation
To eat breakfast or not to eat breakfast? That’s a personal decision. Some people feel more energized with an early meal, while others thrive on an empty stomach until lunchtime. Factors like genetics, lifestyle, and personal preference all play a role.

Circadian Rhythms
New research points to the importance of aligning meal timing with our circadian rhythms—the body’s natural clock. Eating during daylight hours, regardless of whether it’s “breakfast,” could benefit metabolism and overall health.

Why the Myth Lives On
Cultural Conditioning: Breakfast has become synonymous with morning routines. Coffee and toast are as much a ritual as they are a meal.
Economic Interests: Let’s not sugarcoat it—breakfast is a multi-billion-dollar industry. That “most important meal” slogan has been a marketing jackpot for cereal companies.
Confirmation Bias: People love to cling to familiar truths. When we believe something, we’re more likely to notice information that supports it—like that headline about how skipping breakfast “ruins your metabolism.”

Should You Skip Breakfast?
The answer is... it depends. If you enjoy a morning meal, by all means, keep enjoying it. But if you’re not hungry or find intermittent fasting works for you, skip it without guilt. Breakfast isn’t inherently better than other meals—it’s just breakfast.

Conclusion: A Toast to Skepticism
The next time someone parrots the old adage that breakfast is the “most important meal,” remember: traditions, like toast, can sometimes get a little burnt. Whether you’re a morning eater or a breakfast skipper, the key is to nourish your body on your terms.

I'm in this weird space right now, craving connection and pursuing deeper meaning. Life’s been feeling a bit like a dull ache of familiarity—monotonous and unchanging.


I'm caught in between what I think life should be and where I actually am. But- I'm not sad about it. Instead, I'm feeling this spark, this little voice whispering (or maybe shouting) that life's got way more in store than just the work-home-sleep repeat.

Mornings? They're for coffee. It's my little ritual, my moment of zen before the day goes. And when the sun goes down- That's edible time 😬

My (31F) close friend (31F) of more than ten years got married three years ago and since then her husband is always coming to our catch-ups. For context, we’re so close that I was Maid of Honour in their wedding. 

We only hang out every other month or so as we don’t live very close to one another. Thankfully it only started when they got married as they had not lived together before then and far from each other.

She only hangs out with me 1:1 if he goes to exercise etc and she’s alone for a few hours with seemingly no one else to hang out with.

It’s starting to feel like I’m a third wheel at these catch-ups and like I’m intruding on their time together, with little in-joke moments etc. This is despite her mostly asking me to hang out.

Naturally the conversations are much more censored or surface level than they once were as he’s always there.

There’s also been moments where her husband seems to stare into the distance awkwardly and she has emotionally checked him asking if he’s okay etc.

It’s like she brings him because:

a). They want to spend ALL of their weekend together 

b). He’s there as a buffer as she no longer wants to spend 1:1 time with me, and she honestly only asks me out to keep the friendship going somewhat or feels sorry for me

c). He has no friends of his own

I believe if I raise my feelings she’ll just distance herself. I feel my best option is to do a slow fade when she asks to hang out so as to not cause any issues. Maybe catch up every six months?

I am cognisant that being single makes me probably more vulnerable to feeling like a third wheel so I’m likely contributing to the issue.

I think it just bothers me deeply that she just decided to start bringing him everywhere and disregarded my input - like I’m lucky to have time with her whatever which way. I feel rejected, even if this doesn’t make sense - like my company isn’t enough. 

There was also a moment at our last catch-up where we discussed overseas trip plans for the year, and she basically said they would be happy ‘to catch up for coffee etc’ at a point if there’s crossovers. This is so surface level to me, especially as we had always spoken about one day travelling together. 

I’ve written this mostly just to vent and mourn my friendship. It’s very sad too as I know it will only get worse once they have children.

We will be spending most of our time in Crete, but want to spend 3 nights in Santorini. 

We are looking for a (reasonably) luxury experience with a balcony with great views and an outdoor hot tub or pool (typical Santorini thing!). We are trying to keep it below 2500$ CAD for all three nights. 

In terms of visiting, we want to keep it simple for those days so that we can enjoy our accommodations. We only really want to visit Ammoudi Bay, Oia village and Fira. We will save the adventures and excursions for Crete. A typical day would probably look like: morning coffee on the patio, slowly make our way out and walk around an area for a few hours a have some food, back to hotel in the afternoon for swimming/hot tub on the balcony or yard, go back out for dinner in the evening. 

We are debating whether it would be better to stay in center Oia or get something a little further off and rent a car. If we stay central Oia, we should be able to do everything easily by foot/bus, but will have to likely pay more for less value (because of the inflated costs). If we stay in another region, we will likely pay less for potentially more value, but will need to rent a car (which is an added cost in itself) to get to the areas we want.

Looking for advice as to which option would be best suited for us. How easy is it to drive into Oia and Fira? How convenient are the buses really? How relaxing are the famous Oia suites really?

Combine them all together, pair them up, or use them alone, they all add a nice earthiness that doesn't overpower your dish.

Bread doughs, cake batters, meat rubs, muffins, cornbread, cookies, oatmeal; sweet or savory. These spices can add depth to vanilla extract, enhance the flavor profiles of red meats, or just provide a floral note to make dishes more interesting.

When these spices are ground up the flavors are very concentrated and a little goes a long way. They also make up the base for most spiced teas so when they are combined you get a nice, familiar autumn aroma (think spiced chai, pumpkin spice). 

For individual servings, about 1/16th of a teaspoon will suffice. I like putting 1/16th of all three in my oatmeal along with brown sugar or honey. I also just made a white cake the other day that used a teaspoon of allspice in the batter and it totally transformed an otherwise bland, aimlessly sweet cake.

Also made pancakes for my kid yesterday using all three and again just a nice, complex aroma for otherwise run-of-the-mill pancake mix.

Have used them to season lamb and deer stews, and to make cinnamon rolls a bit more mature and to make corn muffins pair with morning coffee.

They are also used in a lot of cola syrups, and you can just put a bit of each in a pot of water on the stove and set it on low to fill your house with the scent of fall/winter.

1ildtcl,https://i.redd.it/puwt90i0z3ie1.png,From Snooze Champion to Morning Warrior: My 6-Year Transformation [image]," Back in 2019, I was basically in a toxic relationship with my snooze button. Hit it 5 times every morning, promised myself ""just 5 more minutes"" (we all know how that goes 😅).

Fast forward to 2025: Up at 6 AM, crushing workouts, and mapping out my day while the city's still sleeping. Wild difference, right?

Here's the thing though - it wasn't some magical motivation hack or trendy morning routine that changed everything.

The real game-changer? I stopped waiting to ""feel motivated.""

Instead, I asked myself: ""Who do I want to become?""

Not just ""What goals do I want to hit?""

The shift was simple but powerful:

• Stopped seeing myself as ""not a morning person""
• Started viewing early mornings as MY time
• Made the morning routine something to look forward to (coffee first, always ☕)

No more dragging myself out of bed feeling guilty. No more rushing through mornings like they're a punishment.

Big secret? There is no secret. Just small, consistent changes that compound over time.

Your morning routine doesn't need to look like mine. But if you're stuck in that snooze-button cycle, remember:

✨ Identity beats motivation
✨ Enjoyment beats discipline
✨ Small steps beat giant leaps

6 years ago, I never thought I'd be that person posting about morning routines. Yet here we are 😂

I've been ""lazy fasting"" for a couple of years now and it's worked really well for me. I'm about 35lbs down and within a healthy BMI range (though subjectively I could stand to lose another 15 I think). I normally do about a 12-8 eating window, black coffee in the morning, and try not to go crazy with food volumes.

I don't count calories and don't want to as this creates a sort of mental fatigue that is really unhealthy for me. As a serial dieter with some historically dysfunctional eating patterns it's much easier for me to just have an eating window and just eat less without thinking too hard.

However, I recently returned from time abroad (in which I lost weight), and since coming back I'm struggling to get back to my easy routine. It's cold and dark here, I'm bored, I'm back working full time from home and I can feel that I'm eating more, for warmth or maybe a dopamine hit. I'm also very much craving sugar in the evenings. I've also recently gone on hormonal contraception and am worried that might be influencing my appetite.

Any tips for getting back on the wagon or managing the evening cravings?

I’m a SAHM and needed coffee. Baby and I were on our way out the door when I fell down the outside concrete “steps”while carrying him in his car seat. Thankfully baby was completely fine just startled and car seat was completely fine. I on the other hand couldn’t get up or put any pressure on my foot. A family member came and insisted we go get it looked at because I couldn’t walk and it was 5x the size of normal. After X-rays it was just a very bad sprain. I was given an air cast splint and told to use crutches and stay off of it until I can get into an orthopedic doctor. I told them that’s not possible I have a baby and can’t use crutches let alone stay off of it. 

Now my partner works 6 days a week and is gone for at least 13 hours all of those days. When this all happened he left work and went and worked on our new house because I said he could I had other help. I told him I’d call when I needed him to come home. The time comes and I call and I’m told he has other stuff he wants to work on there. Mind you he’s not close he’s over an hour away. I was alone and baby was screaming unless I was walking with him which I could barely do. He gets home finally almost 3 hours later. While he’s at work I’ve had other family come over and just help me because I’m in a lot of pain. Everytime I ask him to do anything for me while he’s home he gives me a problem or an attitude. I asked if he could do laundry because baby is out of clean pjs (laundry room is down 2 flights of outside stairs) and he gives me an attitude saying he’s been doing everything and I can do it. 
If you made it this far thank you for listening to my rant. He’s never like this he’s always sweet and does so much idk what’s going on with him. ",1,1739103989.0,beyondthebump,7,0.67,False

1ildkff,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ildkff/my_30f_behaviour_towards_my_bf_36m/,My 30F behaviour towards my BF 36m,"

Hello. I'll try to explain briefly where my question is coming from.

Yesterday, I talked to my boyfriend and told him that today, until 12 PM, I would be covering for my mom at the bar because she’s away. After that, he would come to pick me up so we could go home.

At 12, I called him and told him that I hadn’t been able to leave yet because of customers, but I was just about to go. He wasn’t happy and said, ""It’s always like this"" and ""We had an agreement,"" which I understand. I like to be punctual whenever I can, but if my schedule shifts, I try to stay calm.

He suggested I tell the customers I’m closing the bar, but I decided to stay until they left (I knew they’d be gone between 12:00 and 12:40). I think that upset him because his response was, ""Fine, I’ll come, and you’ll close.""

That scared me because I imagined him coming over and telling my mom’s five customers to leave, which could have caused unnecessary issues that I really didn’t want.

On top of that, I got my period today and feel like crap, plus I have an infected follicle on my labia that burst. I have to walk awkwardly, it stings, it hurts, and all kinds of stuff are coming out. Because of all this, I kind of snapped and told him to just go home because I’d already been suffering for 3-4 hours since I opened the bar. And yeah, I made some money, so I sacrificed myself voluntarily.

In the end, he arrived, the bar was already closed, and I went to wash myself for the third time today and put compresses on my wound.

Meanwhile, I texted him, saying that I don’t feel supported by him, that he’s acted this way before, and that he always will, no matter how I behave with him.

I had hoped he would help me, maybe by chopping wood for the fire or playing with the dog—since I couldn’t, and she had been barking at me all day.

I know I had given him a time, but we didn’t have any big plans—just going home to smoke a joint.

When he arrived, he was upset about my message and started snapping at me, so I snapped back. At some point, I went to the bathroom, and things escalated to the point where he hit me on the head with his hat, and I threw calendula tea at him—because, well, he had already fucked my wound over anyway.

On the way home, I tried to stay quiet and not respond to his yelling about how I ""always do this"" and ""ruin plans.""

(In my heart, I just wish for a man who will be there for me and take care of me as much as he can—because I would do the same for him.)

We hadn’t had coffee yet because we planned to drink it at my place, but I don’t even know how it happened—probably I said something he didn’t like—he suddenly hit my hand while he was driving.

This wasn’t the first time. Another time, while driving, he grabbed my clothes, and I remember my reaction was to hug the steering wheel and slam into him, asking at the same time, ""Why are you manhandling me while I’m driving?""

I admit I have control issues—if someone yells at me or gets aggressive, I lose it and start being aggressive back. But for the most part, I try to be a good and kind person. And I am—as long as no one is yelling at me.

As for what happened today, I screamed at him for hitting my hand while I was holding the steering wheel, he yelled back that he didn’t do anything, and my response was to hit my own hand—""So you can see how it felt when you did it to me.""

No need to tell me we’re both mentally messed up—we know that. We’re not the only ones. Some of you are, too.

Any suggestion or thoughts will be welcomed

Thanks for your time.

We’ve been together for nine months and we were living together before in a flat that costs £1,200 per month. We were paying £600 each. 

This new one is £1875 per month. I told her before we moved that my budget was £600 per month and I couldn’t afford a more expensive place. She insisted it was fine and she will pay the extra since she really wanted this particular flat. A week after we’ve moved in and she’s already telling me that the flat is “hers” and basically saying I have to do things her way. 

Last night we were laying in bed and we were woke up by the kitten at 5am. She has insomnia so she couldn’t get back to sleep and started playing a show on her phone. The noise was pretty loud so now I also couldn’t sleep so she went in the living room. I came in the living room and told her to stay in the bedroom while I went and slept in the spare bedroom so we were both comfy. She insisted I go back in the original bedroom whilst she went back into the living room to listen to her show. 

I fell asleep at this point and when I woke up at 10am I came in the living room and she was asleep. The living room was extremely hot where she’d left the heaters on full blast all night so I turned them off and opened a window. The living room is where the kitchen is so I made myself a coffee and sat on the computer. 

She woke up in a hot rage because I woke her up and started shouting at me, slamming doors and being extremely hostile towards me. She stormed off into the bedroom but then came back to shout at me some more while she got her weed. She said “I’ll make sure you don’t sleep tonight” At this point I couldn’t help but retaliate and shout back because it felt unfair to be treated this way when the living room is a shared space. 

I quickly stopped myself and calmed myself down by playing some peaceful music. Whilst she was yelling in my face, I just ignored her and she went away and turned the WiFi off. I went and calmly turned it back on. 

Then she came back out into the room to yell at me to turn the calming music off, even though it was playing ever so quietly so she couldn’t hear it in the other room. She insisted on turning it off, saying that “it’s my house”. When I refused to turn it off, she went and turned the WiFi off, unplugged it and hid it. 

Then I went in the other room to her because I was extremely annoyed at this point. I told her she’s mentally ill and then I sarcastically said “night night” before closing her door. 

She came out into a hot headed rage and told me to get out of her house and leave. She said she can’t live with me anymore. So I packed all my stuff, left it in the spare room and came out for a walk. 

This is a reoccurring pattern where she’s controlling, dismissive and manipulative. I feel like I’m constantly walking on egg shells.

I first started experiencing **acid reflux, burning pain, and bloating** in August 2024 after taking an NSAID for a running-related knee injury. Initially, I tried to push through, but over time, my symptoms worsened, affecting my daily life, workouts, and even my mental health.

Caffeine was keeping me disconnected from my body’s signals, and letting it go allowed my body to truly heal. Looking back, I’m grateful for this experience—it forced me to slow down, reflect, and take better care of myself.

✅ **Diet Changes** – I had to identify and eliminate trigger foods. While general guidelines exist, everyone’s body reacts differently. My safe foods included:

* Organic protein powder (to maintain muscle)
* Eggs, brown rice, chicken
* No tomatoes, spicy food, caffeine, or excessive sugar

✅ **Working Out & Doubling Down on Goals** – Instead of letting gastritis define me, I trained like I didn’t have it. I adjusted my workouts when needed but never stopped. I **treated my goals as non-negotiable**—I kept **training, building my business, and working on my vision**, despite the setbacks. The mind-body connection is real, and staying physically strong helped me push through mentally.

✅ **Lifestyle Adjustments** – Managing stress was key. I used **meditation, Stoicism, and journaling** to stay mentally strong. I also made big changes in my environment to reduce emotional stress.

✅ **Medications & Supplements** – After experimenting (and learning the hard way), I realized the importance of **trusting a good gastro doctor** and sticking to a plan. Some things I tried:

* **Zinc Carnosine** – Caused flares
* **Teecino & Lion’s Mane** – Didn’t work for me
* **Strict bland diet & cabbage juice** – **Game changers**

# 3. My Turning Point & Recovery

For me, **the biggest shift happened when I fully committed to the healing process**—strict diet, prioritizing mental health, and trusting my body to heal. It took **about six months**, but I gradually returned to normal eating and even coffee.

# 4. How I Reframed the Struggle

This journey wasn’t just about healing physically—it was about course-correcting my life. **I believe prayers helped, no matter what faith you have.** It brought me closer to God, back to my vision and purpose, and aligned me with my goals. In a way, this struggle became a blessing—it gave me the clarity and courage to make bold, life-altering moves.

# 5. Advice for Anyone Struggling

* **Your environment matters.** Reducing stress helped me heal faster.
* **Find what works for YOU.** Healing isn’t one-size-fits-all.
* **Trust your body.** Support it with the right food, habits, and mindset.
* **Don’t let your condition define you.** Keep working out and pursuing your goals as if you don’t have gastritis.
* **Stay patient & don’t lose hope.** You will get better!

I’m fully healed now, and if you’re struggling, feel free to ask me anything—I’d be happy to help!",9,1739102978.0,Gastritis,4,1.0,False

1ilddhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ilddhz/my_girlfriend_is_treating_our_new_flat_like_its/,My girlfriend is treating our new flat like it’s only hers,"I (26M) have just moved in to a new flat with my girlfriend (21F). We’ve been together for nine months and we were living together before in a flat that costs £1,200 per month. We were paying £600 each. 

This new one is £1875 per month. I told her before we moved that my budget was £600 per month and I couldn’t afford a more expensive place. She insisted it was fine and she will pay the extra since she really wanted this particular flat. A week after we’ve moved in and she’s already telling me that the flat is “hers” and basically saying I have to do things her way. 

Last night we were laying in bed and we were woke up by the kitten at 5am. She has insomnia so she couldn’t get back to sleep and started playing a show on her phone. The noise was pretty loud so now I also couldn’t sleep so she went in the living room. I came in the living room and told her to stay in the bedroom while I went and slept in the spare bedroom so we were both comfy. She insisted I go back in the original bedroom whilst she went back into the living room to listen to her show. 

I fell asleep at this point and when I woke up at 10am I came in the living room and she was asleep. The living room was extremely hot where she’d left the heaters on full blast all night so I turned them off and opened a window. The living room is where the kitchen is so I made myself a coffee and sat on the computer. 

She woke up in a hot rage because I woke her up and started shouting at me, slamming doors and being extremely hostile towards me. She stormed off into the bedroom but then came back to shout at me some more while she got her weed. At this point I couldn’t help but retaliate and shout back because it felt unfair to be treated this way when the living room is a shared space. 

I quickly stopped myself and calmed myself down by playing some peaceful music. Whilst she was yelling in my face, I just ignored her and she went away and turned the WiFi off. I went and calmly turned it back on. 

Then she came back out into the room to yell at me to turn the calming music off, even though it was playing ever so quietly so she couldn’t hear it in the other room. She insisted on turning it off, saying that “it’s my house”. When I refused to turn it off, she went and turned the WiFi off, unplugged it and hid it. 

Then I went in the other room to her because I was extremely annoyed at this point. I told her she’s mentally ill and then I sarcastically said “night night” before closing her door. 

She came out into a hot headed rage and told me to get out of her house and leave. She said she can’t live with me anymore. So I packed all my stuff, left it in the spare room and came out for a walk. 

This is a reoccurring pattern where she’s controlling, dismissive and manipulative. I feel like I’m constantly walking on egg shells. What do you think about the situation? Should I leave? ",5,1739102975.0,relationshipadvice,20,1.0,False
