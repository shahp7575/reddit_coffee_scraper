I am a 28 years old. Just for the record - I did not have much of a social life since I was 19 as I had to study and work. Now that I have gotten my education up to a PhD I want to revive my social life and get a girlfriend (and be intimate with someone like 9 years ago not going to lie). Where to meet new people? I have gone to cooking classes a couple of times but most people don't want much friends rather someone to have a laugh during the class and the go back to their life too busy for a drink afterwards. So what to do? Should I just accept I will never again meet a woman who I love and with whom I will live with, go on vacations with, share my goals in life with. Should I accept I will become a 50 year old bachelor who will be fat and wrinkled envying happy people with families.

Or maybe I should accept the fact because I am skinny 135 at 5'10 women don't see me as man enough and they don't want to sleep or have anything to do with me. 

Insecurities aside if it so happens I approach a woman and she goes on a coffee/pizza date with me, should I make my intentions clear that if I find the right person I am ready to start a family with her or should I not say anything and let the relationship progress.

I got really stoned on Friday night and decided to try a new restaurant in the neighborhood. Because they’re new, the owner was working the front greeting customers and she was really sweet to me because I looked like someone in her family. She showed me a picture and it was uncanny!

She offered me a drink and I ordered some food. Thing is, I didn’t realize the portions were massive. On top of that during my wait for the food, the owner kept giving me samples of her other dishes as we talked about how the neighborhood was improving. It was like talking to a doting auntie. 

Did I mention I was stoned?

Well because of that, I ignored my hunger cues for the first time since I started this medication in December and overate massively. 

When I got home, something felt off but I was able to sleep it off until at 4 in the morning I had the most terrible stomach pain I have ever experienced. I got out of bed and ran to the bathroom but no avail. I’m not writhing in pain as I feel the mass of food at the top of my gut. It’s so uncomfortable, the only way for short reprieve was to contort my body to stretch out my stomach a little bit. 

It’s now 7 in the morning and I feel a little bit of acid reflux, so I quickly drive to CVS and buy some Tums and I take that and drink some water and try to sleep a little bit. An hour later the sharp pang in my gut hits again, I immediately wake up and luckily grabbed a bucket and puked my brains out. After cleaning up, I thought the worst was over. I get some water to rehydrate and lie down on the couch. 

Another two hours pass by and the same pain shoots through me. I’m thinking it may be cramping from overeating and think I may need a heating pad but this time the pain is so intense that I didn’t want to drive to CVS. So I use DoorDash to pick one up. The driver can’t find what I need so I have to cancel the order and go get it myself. Worst drive ever. 

I buy the heating pad and it does offer some temporary relief but I still have these awful pangs in my gut. I off-and-on sleep through my Saturday dealing with stomach pains but then I remembered to take some fiber pills because I started suspecting the pain was poop related. It started to feel slightly lower every four hours or so. 

I have to work on Saturday night for my side gig and I tell my manager about my ordeal. He admitted to taking wegovy before and had the same issue when he went to Kbbq. He asked if I can still work and I say yes, but I may need a cover because I upped my hydration and fiber. 

Did I mention besides the tums I threw up, I could not physically eat all Saturday? I only could take small sips of water. Luckily work wasn’t too hectic and I got home around 3:30 am Sunday morning. Still feeling some bad pains, but I feel it’s lower in my gut and I still feel bloated and extremely full. 

I wake up on Sunday around 11 and still feel awful and extremely full. I panicked and looked up how long can someone not eat before they die. I’ve never skipped a day of eating, let alone I’m on my 36th hour. A friend invited me out for a beer around 3:30 and I haven’t eaten but I feel okay to enough to move about. I told him about what’s happening and he told me of a similar story that happened to him. I could only finish a pint of beer in the two hours of hanging out. I get home and it’s around 7 pm. I’ll be just short of 48 hours of not eating anything at all. So I try to eat one of my Factor meals I usually eat for lunch. I eat about half of it before I have to call it quits. So in 48 hours after the accidental binge, I’ve eaten a total of 600 calories. 

Fast forward to today. I feel like 90% better but I know a storm is brewing. I get through my day job relatively easily (I work from home and my manager’s are on vacation). I’m able to eat a factor lunch, drink some coffee (and a lot of water). So I know this chocolate log is going to split me in two. The question is when. I feel well enough to take a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood. 

When I got home, I took a light edible and start watching some Netflix. After eating two small tacos for dinner my edible kicks in but luckily, I’m able to remember the recent pains from the weekend, so I put the rest of the food away and just drink water. Cue to an hour ago, the sphincter doorbell starts ringing. It’s time. 

For the first time in 72 hours I poop. It was the most massive poop I’ve ever taken in my life. My rectum has never stretched so wide for so long which is wild because I’m gay. After giving biological birth to a literal shit baby for 30 minutes, I instantly feel relief. I’m actually euphoric. It may be the edible. It may be that my gut feels normal. It may be pride for having the largest shit in my life. But I’m at peace now. 

TL;DR: I got super stoned and accidentally overate on Friday. After a weekend of stomach pains and constipation, I was finally able to eat and poop after 72 hours of gut torture. Practice moderation even when high, kids. ",1,1742883203.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

Over time, I’ve started experimenting with premium groceries—not just for the sake of spending more, but to see if they genuinely improve taste, health, or my overall lifestyle. Some things have been absolutely worth it, while others felt like a waste. Sharing my experience, and would love to hear yours too!

Staples – Worth It or Just Fancy?

	•	India Gate Basmati (~₹240/kg) – Easily one of the best switches I’ve made. It actually comes close to the quality of restaurant rice, making homemade biryanis and pulaos taste much better. Plus, it helps me stick to home-cooked meals rather than ordering in.

	•	Cold-pressed oils – Haven’t switched yet but curious if they actually make a difference in taste or health. Anyone tried?

	•	A2 Milk – Didn’t feel a difference personally, but I’ve heard people with lactose intolerance benefit from it.

Fruits & Healthy Snacks – Do They Help Stay on Track?

	•	Blueberries & Raspberries – Expensive, but I’ve started including them for their antioxidant benefits. Mixed with curd, they make a great sweet snack that helps me avoid unhealthy cravings.

	•	Brown eggs (premium brands) – I’ve noticed the yolk is more orange, and they taste better, especially since I prefer semi-cooked eggs. Supposedly, they have better nutrients too.

Gourmet vs. Regular – What’s Worth It?

	•	Chocolates – Tried switching to premium chocolates but didn’t enjoy them much. Honestly, I’d rather just have a small bite of Dairy Milk Silk. Open to recommendations, though!

	•	Coffee – Moved away from instant coffee like Nescafé after realizing it’s mostly coffee dust. If you drink it black (Americano), the difference is massive. Feels like a healthier switch too.

	•	Low-fat / low-sodium options – They’re usually 50-100% more expensive in India, and the variety isn’t as good as in Western countries. If anyone has found good low-fat or high-protein grocery options, drop a comment!

Would love to hear what others have upgraded in their grocery list and whether it was worth it! Have you switched to premium brands, and which ones actually made a difference?

I contacted support, but it will take way too long for them to do anything about it until the event is passed. I was counting on the gems from it so I could buy the pass for the coffee bean event. Now I'm just straight up screwed.

I am new in Switzerland. I came to Switzerland from Sweden because I found a job which I believe would be nice next step in my career. It has been a couple of months and I am enjoying my life here. The job is exactly what I imagined and I am happy with it.

However, I noticed there is something weird. My colleagues come early like 8:30 am in morning and leave late like 7 pm or even 7:30 pm in evening. When I ask them why they do so, they say oh we have work, or we took 1 hour lunch break so we need to work more etc etc.

Coming from Sweden, this sounds very weird to me. In Sweden of you come at 8:30 am, you leave at 4:30 pm. Exactly 8 hours later, no matter how much work you have or how many meetings you have or how long was your lunch or coffee breaks. However, here in my company in Switzerland, it seems people want to work more. They almost never take coffee breaks and even skip lunches sometimes because they say they have too much work and they are not hungry.

Is working longer than your contract working hours normal here in Switzerland or it's just how it is in my company? Should I only work 8 hours per day (as my work contract says) or would you advise me to also work longer hours like my colleagues (in order to be like my colleagues so that they don't think I am cheating at my work or something by not working hard enough like them)? I am in a serious difficult place because I feel very uncomfortable and guilty when I leave the office (I come to the office at 8:30 am and leave at 6 pm which is still 1.5 hours longer than my contact but I feel guilty that I am cheating because all my colleagues would be working seriously.)

PS: I am working in Lausanne. I and my colleagues have the same 42 hours per weeks contract and we don't get overpay so staying longer to finish the work don't sense. The company has almost 120 people working there and makes good profits so it's not a starving startup either.",2,1742882683.0,askswitzerland,3,0.75,False

We rest, and the next morning get up early to pack the car. We grab a quick coffee and breakfast before setting up on the beach.

We leave our armor back with the towels and share our real, unmanicured stories, wants and needs, and our gratitudes.  

We head back before sunset because we’d rather miss it than sit in traffic. I look at you, sun-kissed, sandy, and hungry. We shower and get into our comfy clothes, feeling fresh and relaxed. You put on your favorite music and I cook us something healthy that feels guilty, like BBQ salmon and salty charred garden veggies. The sun falls as we finish up, and the lights inside dim to a warm yellow. Everything is cozy, almost blurry. You turn on a movie as I make us a drink. I can smell your shampoo as you nestle in close on the couch. Our sunburns keep us warm under the blanket. As night progresses, so do we. Flirty, soft touches for all the right moments between us. Our glances and grabs allude to adoration and praise. The movie takes on a new role - the only thing between this moment and me taking you upstairs. Grabbing your hand I lead you past your room and into mine. I brace for your hesitation but it never comes, both my greatest hope and fear. We crawl into bed, and we etch today into one another with every touch. Our heartbeats pound slowly, tired yet passionate, symbolic of our separate journeys.

## Understanding Your Needs: Key Considerations Before Buying

Choosing the right electric kettle involves more than just picking a brand. To make an informed decision, consider your specific needs and preferences:

*   **Capacity:** How much water do you typically boil at once? If you frequently brew tea or coffee for a large group, opt for a kettle with a larger capacity (around 1.7 liters). If you primarily need hot water for yourself or a small household, a smaller capacity (around 1 liter) might be sufficient. A smaller kettle can also save space on your countertop.
*   **Boiling Speed:** A faster boiling time can save you precious minutes, especially when you're in a hurry. Look for models with a high wattage for quicker heating.Consider how often you boil water to determine if you prioritize speed above other features.
*   **Features:** Some electric kettles come with features like temperature control, keep-warm functions, and automatic shut-off. Consider which features are important to you and choose a model that offers them. Are you looking for variable temperature controls for brewing different types of tea? Do you need a keep-warm function to maintain the water temperature for an extended period?
*   **Design:** Electric kettles come in a variety of styles, from modern and sleek to retro and classic. Choose a design that complements your kitchen décor and personal taste. Consider the material of the kettle as well; stainless steel is durable and easy to clean, while glass allows you to see the water level.
*   **Safety Features:** Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection are essential safety features that prevent accidents and damage to the kettle. Make sure the model you choose includes these features. BPA-free materials are also important for ensuring the water you boil is safe for consumption.
*   **Budget:** Russell Hobbs offers electric kettles at various price points. Set a budget before you start shopping and look for models that fall within your price range. Remember that investing in a slightly more expensive model with better quality and features can save you money in the long run.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Acetli, Overwhelmed Geneticist***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 27th, 2136*

I was sure my second paw at my new job would be more manageable than the first one. To an extent it was, but not nearly as much as I would’ve liked.

I showed up just a little late, which turned out to be a partial blessing. Partial because I only missed most of a very unhinged conversation between Tanerik and Bemlin.

“—that’s the case, why do they call it milk, then?” I heard Tanerik asking as I stepped into the workroom. He was in the tiny kitchen standing beside a boxy machine I hadn’t seen the previous paw.

“If I were to guess, it would likely be because it bears resemblance to mammalian milk,” Bemlin answered, hardly even looking up from his computer screen on the other end of the room. “Milk would no doubt be an existing word in their language, and the fruit liquid came next.”

“Okay, so probably *not* the extraction process. Good to know.” An ear cocked up at me. “Oh, hey Acetli!”

I blinked a few times. “Good paw. Are we investigating… *milk?*”

“For now. You wanna try some? It goes pretty great with this coffee stuff.”

“I’ll pass,” I said, heading to my desk. I really didn’t even want to know what he was talking about.

Bemlin’s form of greeting me was an almost imperceptible nod. “I’ll let Andrew know you’re both here. Today will be less exciting, if that eases any expectations.”

I sighed internally. “It does.”

I still wasn’t sure I’d gotten over what happened last paw. From the moment I got home to the moment I fell asleep, I was engrossed in remedial research on the topic of artificial intelligence and language models. Even after so many videos and articles, it was hard to wrap my head around. *This is all statistics? How does this stupid computer even know how to change its own calculations? It’s almost like a brain.*

I felt that “almost” was carrying a lot of heft. Parameters, weights, statistics, *blegh*. I preferred it when I didn't feel so constrained by my lack of knowledge. At least I ended up landing a job with a human to help me work this out, even if it was originally for completely different reasons. It was mind-boggling that humanity had independently come up with this technology.

“Oh, good! You two are here,” said Doctor Scheele, walking into the room. His lengthy hair was a wavy mess on either side of his mask. “Did you get some food? Sample the coffee?”

“I ate before I got here,” I said.

“I did!” Tanerik exclaimed. “That milk is great in coffee. Bemlin told me about the plant-stimulant-whatever, which makes it even better. I can feel the boost already.”

The human nodded. “Glad you’re a fan! I have a feeling that machine will pay itself off very quickly. Anyways, I’m sure you’re both more than ready to get started on a proper project. Do you have any lingering questions from yester— last paw?”

I had many, enough to fill a page of digital notes, but Tanerik continued his annoying trend of speaking before me, “Are we going to use KeiVei-Lay for anything? You seemed pretty against it earlier.”

“Great question. We will, but only for *comparison*. If it’s going to be hiding one gene, it’s safe to assume that there will be more.”

I twisted a skeptical ear, immediately forgetting my other questions. “Why are we assuming it’s *hiding* genes?”

“Well, assuming you’re convinced that what I showed last paw was, in fact, a gene, you can’t deny that KeiVei-Lay isn’t showing it. We *could* give it the benefit of the doubt and say that the organization didn’t find it during their… whatever they do when they map a genome, but after *hundreds* of years?”

“It could be a remnant gene,” I protested. “Something that’s lost function over time, and was deemed pointless to even show.”

“Then why wouldn’t the software *show* that? Why, after so long, wouldn’t some poor researcher ever attempt exactly what we did? Nearly the entirety of genetics work is seemingly on the shoulders of just one organization. Doesn’t that seem just a little suspicious?”

“It’s a tool. A *free* tool at the cutting edge of innovation. Countless diseases and inheritable disorders have been studied and cured with the help of it, and it’s easily recognizable by anyone in the field. Results are consistent across researchers who are able to collaborate very easily. There’s a long list of very strong reasons it’s been used for so long.”

Bemlin raised a claw, finally looking away from his screen. “That may be true enough, but allow me to raise you a possibility. Do you think that KeiVei-Lay, being based in Federation space, would have a motivation to hide certain qualities and or modifications of certain species?”

My voice died in my throat. Had it been anyone but Bemlin, I would’ve had a response. Of course, his ancestors had been predators—no, *omnivores* before the Federation altered them and their religion, with nobody the wiser… Facts I didn’t want to give any more attention to than was *strictly* necessary.

Still, the urge to protest didn’t die easily. *We’ve been using it for so long, and now humans come along it’s suddenly bad? How could they even hide something so big for so long? There would have to be nothing to hide in the first place! They have the most efficient methods and cutting-edge software.* *It… has to be something else. The answer has to lie in existing genes, just like the others at the presentation were claiming.*

I felt a pit form in my chest. It was a familiar discomfort that I'd come to associate with humans and their nefarious science-skirting ideas. I knew the feeling wouldn’t go away so easily, especially since I still hadn’t quite recovered from learning humanity had cracked in half yet another field of science a *century earlier*… Although there was something markedly different about this particular pit. I tried to ignore it.

“Let’s, uh, stick with the facts regardless,” Doctor Scheele said. “KeiVei-Lay software, for *whatever reason*, isn’t showing one gene, and I’m curious to know if there are more. That’s a nice segue, because that’s exactly what I want your first project to be.”

“Cool!” Tanerik exclaimed. “Does that mean that we’ll be using human software? Including AI?”

“It does! I managed to find something that should be exactly what you need for this kind of thing. There’s also different forms of AI that are helpful for writing your own programs or modifying others if you ever find the need. Which you most likely will.”

I had a few questions about that, but the human seemed intent on getting us started and answering our own questions. He introduced us to something called GenomIQ Lite. It was some human-made software-AI thing (is there a difference?) that, according to him, “looked pretty good”, which made me wonder exactly how familiar he was with it.

“It came out pretty recently, too,” Doctor Scheele said, tapping at his holopad. “Of course, if you find any other software you prefer for whatever reason, feel free to use that. So long as it gets the job done.”

“Question,” Tanerik said. “Can Gamma Fold be used for finding analogous proteins? I’ve been thinking about what you showed last paw, and I’m pretty sure it’ll be a worthwhile thing to look into.”

“It definitely can. Bemlin started looking into that, actually. Are you interested in working on something similar?”

The motion of his ears and tail left no doubt to his interest. “Yes! If it goes anywhere, it could prove that these hidden genes are worth looking at.”

“Great! Bemlin, you want to take on a disciple?”

Bemlin waved a beckoning claw. “Bring your holopad.”

Tanerik left me alone, energetically rolling his chair over to the Gojid, ridiculous head tuft bouncing all the way.

Doctor Scheele turned his attention to me. “Just to be sure, are you interested in this? Finding new genes?”

“Yes,” I firmly said. “I was actually hoping to learn more about human AI, so this would be a good opportunity. I also want to ensure that this new gene isn’t a fluke. Or that it *is* a fluke.”

“I like that attitude! I'd actually *love* for it to be a fluke, that'd be vastly preferable over the, uh, alternative… Anyways…” he tapped at his holopad a few times. “There should be a folder in your workbook that has everything you need to get your very own AI running. The authors of GenomIQ say it’s pretty much plug and play… Just go through the materials and you should be good to start playing around with things.”

“Play around?” I asked.

The human nodded. “Yeah. It’s a bit on the simpler side, but it is still programming, so I wouldn’t be surprised if you get sucked down a hole exploring what’s possible. And don’t be afraid to do so! You might find something interesting. Just remember to save your progress frequently.”

I found the folder he was talking about. “What’s the overarching goal of using this AI? Plug and play?”

“If you faintly remember my presentation, you might recall that a learning model needs to be trained before it can make predictions. In this case, given a genome and a bunch of known genes, what might be the training data and what might be the predictions?”

“The training input would be… known genes. Would that be a nucleotide sequence?”

“It would be closer to a *location* in the genome, but essentially, yes.”

I flicked an affirming ear. “And the predictions would be new genes. Which would also be a location.”

“Exactly. The idea would be to give the AI *part* of the genome and a very long list of locations of known genes within that region of the genome. Then, test it on *another part* of the genome to see if it can find other known genes. Now that we know it works, we give it the *entire* genome again, and it will tell us the location of every gene with a confidence score for each. We could even go a step further and ask it to tell us the *kinds* of genes it finds, but that can wait.”

Like last paw, I was having trouble coming to terms with how *simple* he made it seem. Another thought came to mind. “Doesn’t this seem overkill for finding genes? I understand that these… *AI models* are very good at abstracting data, but this is vastly simpler than a three dimensional protein structure. I mean, Bemlin apparently found one by manually searching. Couldn’t a normal program do that?”

“It could, and it has. The main reason I’m tending towards AI right now is because it counterintuitively is more straightforward. I could give you an existing, much simpler program, but you’d have to learn to alter the search function for Gojid consensus sequences rather than human. And then the confidence scoring would need to be adjusted, along with the coding versus non-coding detection… You get the idea. A language model solves many more problems than it causes at this point in time.”

“And since the training data is the genes within the Gojid genome, it automatically adjusts itself for what we’re looking for,” I deduced.

“Exactly! You’re on the right track. Spend some time with it, and shoot me a message if you get stuck.”

I signalled agreement, though I pretended I didn’t hear that last part. I was *not* going to let myself get stuck. It was just me and an overblown statistics program. I’d dealt with much worse. With proper access to one, there was no better way to learn exactly how it worked. And along the way, I might even get to prove that the new gene was a fluke.

Or, more regrettably, that it wasn’t.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 27th, 2136*

Responding to emails was an exponential equation, where *misery* was a function of *number of emails replied to*. It started out perfectly fine, until it very quickly wasn’t.

Maybe some weird arctangent function would be a better descriptor, but that didn’t change the fact that I was not enjoying myself. There was some reprieve when Acetli and Tanerik showed up, at least, but it didn’t last long.

Tanerik had gone home already, but not after making a surprising amount of progress. Somehow, he managed to download some kind of human-made program after deciding Gamma Fold was more of a screwdriver when he needed a hammer.

“It’s supposed to compare it against the human proteome,” Tanerik said, showing me his progress. “I’m just supposed to paste the sequence in here, right?”

“Uhh… Maybe…?” I drawled, trying to decipher whatever was on his screen. “Where did you even find this?”

“I looked it up and it was the first result. Some sort of sequence matching stuff, and a human proteome seemed appropriate enough.”

“I mean, sure, but… Actually, paste in the sequence. See what happens.”

He clicked a few buttons. “Okay. It’ll be done in…” He got closer to the screen, squinting. “Forty-seven minutes?”

I smiled incredulously. “Okay, now I’m *really* curious as to where you found this program. Can you send me the link to wherever you downloaded this?”

His shift was over shortly after that. I didn’t think to move the job over to my server before he left, so his computer was left running. I spent a few minutes looking at his link, but couldn’t find out much by the time something else came up.

That was what I guessed was going to be the main event of today—talking with Rosim about whatever it was he wanted. I walked over to the workroom to grab Bemlin. We talked a little bit about snow globes on the way over.

I stepped into Rosim’s office, Bemlin following behind me. Also inside beside Rosim was another Venlil, one I recognized by his aging gray fur around his otherwise black face and ears. He was among those who’d stayed late at my presentation to ask questions. So many questions.

I pretended to know his name. “Hey, how’s it going? Good to see you both.”

“It is going well,” Rosim replied. “I’m grateful you could make time this paw.”

“It took much effort on my part,” Bemlin said, emotionless yet so very pointed.

“Lots of work to do,” I mumbled. “Anyways, I saw the brief description in your email, but could you summarize the project, just so we’re all on the same page?”

Rosim clasped his paws together. “As you know, there’s been much effort into taking a second look at known genes with the added lens of what we know now. Hastum and I have been coordinating to do a large-scale study with the goal of finding genetic links to patient-derived allergic responses. We then plan to compare normalized expression levels of these genes across species in order to find any trends.”

The other Venlil, Hastum, flicked his ears. “And hopefully these trends will have something to show for purely prey species and those who have been modified. From there, I imagine we’ll have enough insight to guide future research in more specific directions.”

I leaned forward in my seat. I’d read plenty of snippets of digital alien textbooks, but I never got into how exactly they went about obtaining all their information. I wasn’t too keen on sifting through some of the most brain-numbing, nap-inducing, agonizingly boring material in the universe to read through: methods sections.

That said, *talking* about methodology was actually quite engaging. These two seemed to have developed a top-down approach, starting at the affected population and working down towards implicit genes.

I was doing essentially the opposite, looking for genes and their functions to find the effects on an individual. With how advanced the Federation was technologically, I expected that sort of approach to be much more common. Simulation was a very powerful tool… although their lack of AI may have played a role in that.

“Sounds pretty big, but straightforward enough,” I said, holding back a plethora of other comments I already had.

Rosim continued, “The reason I wanted to bring our study to your attention is because of your recent presentation. These ‘language models’ have sparked many people, Hastum and I included, to do much more digging on humanity’s methodology for similar problems. We, uh, think you might have some insights that the rest of us do not. We’re covering our tails, so to speak.”

“Just to be clear, you *do* have access to humanity’s research on AI?”

He flicked an ear. “There is *much* to catch up on.”

“Why haven’t you gone looking until now?”

“I, er, suppose I had to see it to believe it.” He glanced at the other Venlil for reassurance.

Hastum shrugged his ears. “There’s already enough flying by, causing a ruckus.”

*Good, so I’m not going crazy*. “Alright. So you just want me to think of anything that might help your study? I’m not sure AI specifically will be of any particular help for your specific approach. I mean, you could definitely find something, but… I don’t know, how are you finding genetic links? You don’t have a few thousand volunteers that I don’t know about, right?”

He hesitated. “That, er , would be ideal, but we’re currently looking at data from already existing studies done.”

*Of course. Volunteers might be… hard to come by.* I glanced at Bemlin. I frowned, finding the Gojid as inscrutable as ever.

Rosim added, “Admittedly, the data is *somewhat* tangential to what we’re looking for, but it should provide a good basis.”

“And then you have to determine what genes are analogous and how expression varies…” I rubbed my chin. “How do you know which species aren’t modified?”

“We don’t know with certainty for most, but that’s something that would likely be sought after in the later steps of our study.”

“Why don’t you just storm the KeiVei-Lay headquarters?” I sarcastically asked, before something suddenly occurred to me. “Are you going to include humans in the study?”

They exchanged glances. “No plans have been made to do so.”

“No plans at all? I’m willing to wager humans are one of the few that are certainly unmodified, considering we exist. In fact…” I brought out my holopad and searched something up. “Humans can become allergic to meat quite easily. An insect bite is all it takes.”

Bemlin gave me a look. “You have an antibody for meat?”

“Alternative splicing is weird,” I absently said. I read through the parts of Wikipedia that would’ve been censored by the firewall if not for my credentials. “Specifically mammalian meat, at least for this particular case. Alpha galactose…? Anyways, you should incorporate analogous human genes into your study. And look into human meat allergies. Might give you an antigen structural motif to base something off of.”

I finished my brief reading, and glanced up to see two mortified Venlil. I supposed I should’ve expected that reaction to talk of meat, though they made a poor choice in research if they didn’t want to talk about that stuff.

Hastum eventually replied, “I'm… thoroughly familiar with immune responses. I'm sure these, ah, *insect bites* may be useful, though it doesn't help us with the genetics of this ordeal.”

“Humans may be the single best species to compare to,” Bemlin piped up. “They are true omnivores.”

“To add onto that,” I said, “We may be the only unaffected baseline in the galaxy. But honestly, I’m probably not the right person to talk to about the nitty gritty details about the specific genetics of human immunology. I mean, I’ve looked at plenty of analogous genes among Terran and Venlilian plants, but that doesn’t really apply to this.”

“Would you happen to know anyone who does?” Rosim asked.

“I don’t think—” I started, before someone in particular sprung forth. In fact, I was pretty sure Su Hui had at some point mentioned something about her. “Actually, I might.”

“Perhaps you could contact them on our behalf?” Rosim asked.

“That would speed things along,” Hastum added. “Perhaps it all comes down to a single gene controlling a single antibody’s expression… Or perhaps we’re not so lucky, and humans are a true anomaly.”

“I’ll ask around,” I said, smiling behind my mask. “Anything else?”

Rosim’s ears perked up. “Yes! Er, could you keep us up to date with this new gene you’ve found? Many people have been talking about it, with various levels of acceptance.”

“We’re in the process of looking for more, actually. Acetli should make some progress in that very soon, and Tanerik… uh, what did he do again, Bemlin?”

“I have no idea,” he deadpanned.

I had to suppress a laugh. Sometimes it was very hard to tell when the Gojid was being purposefully humorous. “That’s all from us for now, then.”

Bemlin and I made our exit, dodging a few Venlil who wanted to talk with me along the way. I arrived at my office with five new emails, but one of them was from Su Hui. Of course, that took priority. She wanted to hear from a reputable source that the building wasn’t burning down.

>Scheele,

>How are things going? Outstandingly well with no issues whatsoever, I must presume. I hope you have projects for your new hires, and that everything is running smoothly.

>I’ve also received a few emails about this new gene, it seems. Keep the others up to date with your findings. Don’t forget your research update due in two days. And finally, do not hesitate to contact me if anything important comes up.

I liked Su’s emails. Succinct and to the point, unlike these aliens whose bodies of text were somehow more fluffed up than their wooly fur. I sent her a nothing reply, half-scolding her about working on her days off. I could tell her all about what I’d discovered later.

I ignored the other emails for the time being, silently wishing for some kind of assistant to sift through them all. I also made a note to reach out to my not-so-old friend who might know exactly how to help out Rosim and Hastum.

I checked my posture and pulled up the UN open research database and searched for “Gojid analogous genes”. There were 19 new results since I last checked. None were relevant, and half were about some kind of glycogen synthase kinase pathway. My next search term was “novel genes”. Again, nothing relevant.

One by one, I went down my list of relevant topics.

Such a big number suggest that big guys  (whales, most likely institutions like banks and VC) are piling in, ready to deploy into the market and thus influencing the price up and this new $132.4B ath on stablecoins proves it. 

If similar past events means anything, it means that we will likely see a price rally sooner than later (search for March 2024 stablecoin market pump and how btc reacted) and I do believe it will be next month and beyond, we will have an amazing Q2. 

 We need to remember that a lot runs on the Ethereum blockchain (nfts, DeFi, memecoins) and such a big number on stablecoins means action will soon happen. 

I'm really hyped about Ethereum and the amount of accumulation happening at these prices and I can't help but imagine we will get back to 3k pretty soon and hopefully 4k after ans beyond STILL this year. 


I know we have been down a lot for quite some time now and it's understandable to be mentally affected by it but I really suggest to just dca and believe Ethereum will have a stroke bounce back up 👌

my coworker (f25) got a bf recently and had brought him into work couple times. he’s dropped food off, picked her up, and has even brought us coffee. he’s a nice guy overall. 

but my supervisor (f29) hasn’t met him yet so as my other coworker was getting picked up by her bf, my coworker teased her saying “awwe” or just little “he seems so sweet!” comments. i wouldn’t even call it teasing, just playful convo. 

i told my coworker “ur relationship is the cutest” and she was all blushed and thanking us for our kind words. but naturally she was a little embarrassed bc my other coworker made eye contact with the bf in the parking lot from our store. 

she had pointed and kinda laughed and poked that it was cute for him to pick her up. but i guess the bf did not appreciate any of our actions. 

the next day (today) my coworker comes in and says to me that we made her bf feel very uncomfortable and that she would think it’s right to apologize to him. i’m a little confused bc i didn’t see the harm in what i did entirely. i see the harm in my other coworker, but not myself. 

she had stated her bf “wasn’t in the mood” and said that he was very upset and wanted some form of apology. i naturally agreed with her but then realized a whole apology is a little dramatic. unless im the asshole here? AITAH? ",0,1742880643.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

So I went through the threads here and took some advice (I love this community!).

I (15F) am on a family vacation with a bunch of relatives, and since there are so many of us, we’re all sharing rooms.  

My parents told me I’d be rooming with my cousin Olivia (21F), which I was fine with at first because we’ve always gotten along really well. But now that we’re here, I found out that there’s only one bed, and we have to share it. 

I wasn’t super comfortable with it at first, but Olivia just laughed and told me not to be shy. She’s been saying stuff like, “You’re so tiny, I barely even need to make space for you,” and “You’ll probably end up stealing the blankets anyway.” She keeps acting like it’s funny, but I don’t know… it still feels kinda weird?
She’s been really sweet to me all day, though. She bought me this expensive iced coffee that I wanted, even when I told her I didn’t have money for it. Then she got me this little bracelet from one of the shops, even though I told her she didn’t have to. She even kept fixing my hair and saying stuff like, “You’re seriously so pretty, you know that?” which made me feel kinda shy because no one ever says stuff like that to me. 

Anyway, when we got back to the hotel, I kinda hesitated before getting into bed, and she noticed. She pulled the blanket up and was like, “Come on sweetheart , it’s just me. What, are you scared of cooties?”  
 
Then when I laid down, she was like, “You’re all stiff. You can relax, you know.” I at first just stayed on my side, but she actually pulled me into her and wrapped her arm around my waist.  I know she was awake while doing it because she was like "" Isn't that better?"" 

I don’t think she means anything weird by it, but I just feel off for some reason? I don’t wanna make a big deal out of nothing, but I guess I just don’t know if I’m overthinking it. Is this just a normal thing? Should I just try to ignore it and act normal?

Making new friends as an adult feels way harder than it should be, right? Between work, responsibilities, and the general chaos of life, it’s tough to find people to genuinely connect with.

So I met this guy at this event thing and I knew I liked him but just acted normal because I didn’t want to get involved with anyone from the events but I liked his eyes but I acted normal but he then was giving me these eye signals that he clearly likes me too. Then one of the event days I was with him and these others at the after party, then me and him were leaving then he asked if I want to go somewhere for a drink or something then I said I want something to eat then he said we could go to a corner shop but I thought no way this is silly and it was nearly 3am then we saw two guys and a girl from the event waiting for taxis so I took it as a sign that I should go home too, he waited for my taxi to come but didn’t pay for it but I guess I didn’t know him well enough anyway but while we were walking down some stairs he put his hand out for me to hold while walking down the stairs which was either sweet or him just wanting to hold my hand for a min or both anyway while we were waiting I said I was cold and he gave me his coat which I did like. And the whole event he would give me this look lol. Anyway he walked me to the taxi but didn’t open the door and I like guys opening doors but anyway that was the second or 3rd time seeing him (in the events brief convos etc seeing him around). Also he was walking very close to me so like making it obvious he likes me. Then on the one of the last nights I left quickly to buy an iced coffee (just £1) but he walked with me so I don’t have to walk on my own that late because I asked and he asked if I wanted him to pay for it but I felt awk to say yes so I just said it’s okay, anyway later in the night we were all there then quite a few of us walked to a club where they had pizza too because it was the last after party, while we were all walking together me and him were talking and I asked him what type of woman he would want to be with, an independent woman or a dependant woman then he said independent and said that he would want her to have her own stuff going on in her life and ambitions etc but then I explained I meant like in the financial aspect if she had ambitions etc but wanted him to pay for everything and provide then I can’t remember word for word what he said because I think he was like well he wouldn’t mind paying but it’s nice when the girl does that every now and again which I said well I would on my mans birthday haha, anyway idk if I was just hearing what I wanted to hear. Anyway we seemed to agree a lot on that there is a lot of toxic feminism etc and a lot of women who date men and don’t let them be there for them etc or say that don’t need a man and put there man down etc But anyway I also did tell him a lot on why I like being in my feminine energy and that even when I see my cousins they carry my bags and everything. Anyway he then later on when we were dancing offered to carry my bag because I didn’t want to hold it or leave it on a table out of my sight. So when we were all at the bar he asked me what I wanted to drink then I asked the bar staff for a mocktail and before he paid he said to me ‘I swear if this mocktail ends up being £500’ he was joking but idk about men making jokes about not paying, anyway he paid then we sat down and he asked me to dance and we danced then he kept giving me those eyes again and I was kinda getting shy because I liked him and I also know that out of respect for myself I can’t let it go anywhere without him actually investing, he asked if he can kiss me and I said I am not one of those girls that just kiss guys without actual dating etc anyway later we went out for a few mins and while we were out he said sorry about coming on to me then I said it’s fine and was trying to explain that it is just because I want to actually be dating the guy first etc and he kept trying to interrupt me calmly saying that I do not need to explain why I don’t want to kiss, then I said to him that it isn’t that I don’t find him attractive etc but yeah. Anyway we went back in and he said to me that it probs wouldn’t work with us anyway because he drinks alcohol then I said to him that that isn’t what I care about too much but (and I should not have said this because I never make the first move but I only said it because he was showing me he liked me but I still shouldn’t have) I just said ‘well if you wanted to take me out for dinner then I wouldn’t say no’ then he said he will definitely take me out for dinner. Anyway we carried on dancing while he had my bag on him then the place was closing so we were waiting outside and it was raining and I said I was tired and wanted to sit down but not on the ground then he sat on the ground so that I could sit on his knees without getting myself dirty which I found so sweet, anyway he asked if I was going to book a taxi and I said yes but told him if we are going to start dating he will be the one paying for my taxis haha, anyway this other guy who was with us was saying he might see if his taxi can drop me off but then didn’t come back so he just said ‘you know what I am just going to book you a taxi’ then while he was booking it for me he said ‘did I tell you I was broke?’ Which I found weird because I don’t like men talking about money idk if he was just saying it, anyway then I tried to say it’s fine but he insisted, taxi said there was like 15 plus mins left to wait so we got up and went into a reception area building to sit down and wait. After a bit of talking because it was empty there he told me there are two cameras, one ahead of us and one behind me (which I found interesting how he looked around for cameras?) Anyway we were sat talking and I asked him what is the worst thing and best thing someone’s done to him and when he was saying the worst thing he was beating around the bush a lot saying a girl who was his best friends girlfriend accused him of stuff and I had to prod more for him to then say she accused him of being violent and trying things on with her (basically edging around her accusing him of some sort of sexual assault) and idk if he was telling the truth or not because a few guys have said that in the past and I can’t think of many women who would lie about that idk. Then he said to me ‘you don’t have to tell me what the worst thing someone has done to you is’ which was nice to hear because it didn’t feel like he was trying to get info from me But after I got him up to try to floor him then he started getting closer and trying to come closer to kissing me, he did kiss my neck for a second then moved but I didn’t let him kiss me but idk if I was giving him signals, he then said ‘stop resisting’ while coming close for a kiss but he didn’t actually force anything and we didn’t kiss but idk about someone saying that it sounds weird idk. And he didn’t text to see if I got home okay but it was on his uber anyway. The next day it was the last event day and I saw him, he was less handsy because he didn’t drink probs, anyway I asked if he was going to walk me to the bus stop and he walked me but then didn’t even wait for the bus to come or message me to see if I got home safe Idk if I am right to not talk to him again like if I am just having a big crush that I am not listening to my standards or gut

Sorry if it sounds weird i didnt want to post it but idk what to do because i feel torn because i don’t know if I am exaggerating and was just being an idiot sending mixed signals but i did tell him that i did not want to do anything 🤦‍♀️ 

I really shouldn’t date rn I need therapy because if this isn’t a great guy then its because my unhealed self is attracting that idk 😩 I feel stupid idk :/

# 2025's Best Water Filter Replacement Kits: Reviews & Top Picks for Pure water!

Are you tired of questionable tap water clouding your glass, or worse, impacting your health? As we head into 2025, the market for water filter replacement options is booming, offering more choices than ever before. Choosing the right water filter replacement can seem daunting, but it's a critical step in ensuring you have access to clean, safe, and grate-tasting water. This comprehensive guide will explore the best water filter replacement kits available, focusing on different types of filters and catering to various needs, from homeowners and renters to property managers and buisness owners.

## Why is Regular Water Filter Replacement Essential?

before diving into specific products, let’s address why regular water filter replacement is so important. Over time, water filters become less effective as they accumulate contaminants. These contaminants can range from sediment and chlorine to more harmful substances like lead, bacteria, and pesticides. Ignoring filter replacement can lead to:

   **reduced Water Quality:** Your water may taste and smell unpleasant due to the presence of chlorine, sediment, and other impurities.
   **Health Risks:** Ineffective filters may not remove harmful contaminants, potentially exposing you and your family to health risks.
   **Appliance Damage:** Sediment and mineral buildup can damage appliances that use water, such as refrigerators, coffee makers, and dishwashers. This is particularly relevant for small business owners who rely on these appliances for their operations.
   **Reduced Water Flow:** A clogged filter can restrict water flow, reducing the efficiency of your filtration system and your overall water pressure.

Knowing how often to replace water filter cartridges is crucial for maintaining optimal water quality and preventing these issues. This frequency depends on factors like the type of filter, the amount of water used, and the quality of your incoming water supply.## Understanding Your Water Filtration Needs

choosing the right water filter replacement requires understanding your specific needs.this includes evaluating the type of filtration system you have installed, the contaminants you want to remove, and your budget.Our examination focuses on key categories:

### Refrigerator Water Filter Replacement

Refrigerators with built-in water dispensers and ice makers use water filters to improve water quality. Replacing your refrigerator water filter regularly is crucial for ensuring the water and ice you consume are free of contaminants. When selecting a refrigerator water filter replacement, make sure it is compatible with your refrigerator model. Many generic water filter replacement options are available that offer a more affordable alternative to branded filters, but always check for certifications to ensure they meet quality standards.

### Whole House Water Filter Replacement

For homeowners seeking comprehensive water filtration, whole house water filters are an excellent solution. These systems filter all the water entering your home, protecting your pipes, appliances, and ensuring clean water from every tap. When choosing a whole house water filter replacement, consider the filter's lifespan, flow rate, and the types of contaminants it removes. Some filters are designed to target specific issues like sediment, chlorine, or hard water.

### under Sink Water Filter Replacement

Under sink water filters offer a convenient and effective way to filter water at a single faucet, typically in the kitchen. These systems are ideal for renters or homeowners who want to improve the quality of their drinking water without installing a whole-house system. Several types of under sink water filter replacement options are available, including carbon filters, reverse osmosis filters, and multi-stage filters. Choosing the right one depends on your specific water quality concerns.### Pitcher Water Filter Replacement

Pitcher water filters are a simple and affordable option for improving water quality. These pitchers use filters to remove contaminants as you pour water. While not as comprehensive as other filtration systems, pitcher water filter replacement is a convenient solution for renters or individuals with limited space. Consider the filter's capacity,filtration speed,and the types of contaminants it removes when selecting a pitcher filter replacement.### Faucet Water Filter Replacement

Faucet water filters attach directly to your faucet, providing filtered water on demand. These filters are easy to install and offer a convenient way to improve water quality for drinking and cooking. Faucet water filter replacement is generally straightforward,and replacement filters are readily available.

### Reverse Osmosis Filter Replacement

Reverse osmosis (RO) systems provide the highest level of water filtration, removing a wide range of contaminants, including dissolved solids, heavy metals, and bacteria. if you have an RO system,regular reverse osmosis filter replacement is essential for maintaining its effectiveness. RO systems typically have multiple filters that need to be replaced at different intervals.

## Top Picks for Water Filter replacement Kits in 2025

While specific product recommendations evolve rapidly, here’s a general overview of what to look for in top-performing water filter replacement kits, categorized by system type:

**Refrigerator Water Filters:**

   **NSF Certification:** Look for filters certified by NSF International to ensure they meet industry standards for contaminant reduction.
   **Compatibility:** Double-check the filter’s compatibility with your specific refrigerator model. Use the model number if available to confirm.
   **Filter Life:** Consider the filter’s lifespan. Most refrigerator filters need replacing every six months.

**Whole House Water Filters:**

   **flow Rate:** Choose a filter with a flow rate that matches your household’s water usage to avoid pressure reduction.
   **Filter Size:** Select the correct filter size for your whole house filtration system.
   **sediment removal:** Prioritize filters with effective sediment removal to protect your pipes and appliances.
   **Carbon Filtration:** Opt for filters with carbon filtration to remove chlorine, taste, and odor from your water.

**under Sink Water Filters:**

   **Filtration Stage:** Consider multi-stage filters for comprehensive contaminant removal.
   **Ease of Installation:** Choose filters that are easy to install and replace, especially if you're a DIY enthusiast.
   **Space Considerations:** Select a filter that fits comfortably under your sink, accounting for plumbing and other fixtures.

**Pitcher Water Filters:**

   **Filter Life:** Check the filter's lifespan and replacement frequency.
   **Filtration Speed:** Consider how quickly the filter can purify water.
   **Pitcher Capacity:** Choose a pitcher with a capacity that meets your needs.

**Reverse Osmosis Filters:**

   **Membrane Quality**: Quality RO Membrane is the core of RO system and essential for pure water. It determines the water quality and purification ability.
   **Filter Set**: Regular replacement for Pre-Filter and Post-Filter is vital for system's purification.
   **Filter Replacement Schedule**: Replacing filters by schedule helps maintain system's performance.

## Finding Affordable Water Filter Replacement Options

The cost of water filter replacement can add up over time, especially for those with multiple filtration systems. Here are some tips for finding affordable water filter replacement options:

   **Generic Filters:** Consider generic water filter replacement cartridges, which are often more affordable than branded filters. However, ensure they are certified to meet quality standards.
   **Water Filter Subscription:** Explore water filter subscription services that offer automatic filter delivery at discounted prices. This is particularly beneficial for homeowners and businesses that require regular filter replacements. Aquasana offers services like this and is worth considering for convenience.
   **Bulk Purchases:** If you manage multiple properties or own a business, consider purchasing water filter replacements in bulk to save money.
   **Discounts and Promotions:** Keep an eye out for discounts and promotions on water filter replacements from online retailers and local stores.

## Water Filter Replacement Near Me: Local Options

While online shopping offers convenience and variety, sometimes you may need a water filter replacement near me instantly. Consider these options:

   **local Hardware Stores:** Home enhancement stores like Lowe's and Home Depot typically carry a wide selection of water filter replacements.
   **Appliance Stores:** Appliance stores that sell refrigerators and other water-using appliances often stock replacement filters.
   **Plumbing supply Stores:** Plumbing supply stores may carry specialized water filter replacements for whole-house and under-sink systems.
   **Water Treatment Specialists:** Local water treatment specialists can provide expert advice and sell high-quality water filter replacements.

## Ensuring Water quality: Certifications and Standards

When choosing a water filter replacement, look for certifications from reputable organizations like NSF international and the Water Quality Association (WQA). These certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets industry standards for contaminant reduction. NSF certification is essential for ensuring that the filter effectively removes the contaminants it claims to remove. Always prioritize certified water filter replacement options to protect your health and ensure optimal water quality.

## addressing Specific Concerns: Targeted Filtration

Different water sources contain different contaminants. Some common concerns include:

   **Lead:** Lead contamination can pose serious health risks, especially for children. Choose a filter certified to remove lead.
   **Chlorine:** Chlorine is added to water to disinfect it, but it can also affect taste and odor. Carbon filters effectively remove chlorine.
   **PFAS:** PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a growing concern in many water supplies. Look for filters certified to reduce PFAS levels.
   **Sediment:** Sediment can clog filters and damage appliances. Choose a filter with effective sediment removal capabilities.

## Considerations for Property Managers and Small Business Owners

Property managers and small business owners have unique water filtration needs. Here are some considerations:

   **Durability and Longevity:** choose durable water filter replacements that can withstand heavy use.
   **Ease of Installation:** Opt for filters that are easy to install and replace to minimize maintenance time and costs.
   **Compliance with Health Codes:** Ensure that your water filtration system meets local health code requirements.
   **Scalability:** Select a system that can accommodate the water usage needs of your property or business.   **Water filter replacement service**: consider an ongoing water filter replacement service to ensure consistent water quality and reduce employee burden.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/B0mMCWcuzz

I am thriving and so is my sibling. 9 years after my original post, 9 years of only rare text contact with my NMom and still no contact or harassment from my father. He has spent a fuckton of money scrubbing every mention of himself, professional or personal, from the internet. I recognize now the harm my childhood therapist did in reporting the abuse so late- I think the last month before my younger sibling's 18th birthday-, despite hearing enough to report a few years before that. I recognize she was complacent to the abuse, and if she reported earlier we could have had grounds for a criminal case. She said something like ""you're the one who told me your life would be in danger if I reported"" or ""at first I thought you were just dramatic and spoiled.""

Therapy (with actual good therapists) has helped me name that I survived sex trafficking- literally traded by my Nmom to my dad for safety, money, and housing, she has admitted this. I survived my mother's munchhausen's by proxy, and neglect of basic needs despite their wealth. I am a cult survivor (many of the ""snake-oil"" ""doctors"" led personality cults which my mom would eventually get bored of or kicked out of for not paying), and survivor of intrafamilial child torture.

Googling our last name now only shows my art, my sibling's writing about surviving the abuse, and our professional accomplishments. Little to nothing of our parents.

I wrote my original post in college. College was hard. I used it to leave my hometown, but I had no safe place to go between semesters and relied on internships with housing stipends, couch surfing, going to stay with Nmom but being in danger, and moving in too early with a partner who was not good to me. Sibling did something similar. I didn't realize that I was technically considered homeless/housing insecure at times until a few years ago, the instability seemed so normal and safe in comparison to what I experienced.

We used the last of family money, child support from my parents' divorce (which my mom was using for herself but then gave a part of back in a moment of guilt) to catch up on years of medical neglect and continue EMDR and other therapy modalities. I am in recovery from my eating disorder and have a healthy relationship with alcohol, a couple drinks per month or none at all. I weigh more than I ever expected, but my labs are amazing and I am active and love my curves. Even though I can't always predict my health, my symptoms are so well managed that people are surprised to learn I am disabled.

Sometimes I feel behind in my career, and with my mixed performance in college I barely slid by. But I played it safe and took stable jobs with good benefits, focusing on my health and my art and friendships. I am going through a career change into the legal field, but not criminal law because that's too close to home. I have a killer poker face, quick crisis thinking, charisma, and stubbornness to fight tooth and nail through beurocracy. I think I'll do well.

One of the last things I did before cutting in-person contact with Nmom was grab me and my sibling's documents/ID cards, a few childhood momentos, and most importantly, my cat, who she threatened to drop off at a shelter for no reason in order to get a rise out of me (the plan was I would take her after college). We adopted her as a kitten when my father was around less and less. Once, he tried to harm her, but I blacked out with rage and he fled.

I was not ready to take this cat, but I negotiated with my landlord anyway,  put the pet insurance premium on my credit card, and moved out of a crappy studio to give us more room.

9 years later I wake up in bed and I am safe. That same cat, now 14 and chubby, sits purring on my chest. She helped re-train my nervous system to feel safe falling asleep and waking up. I have a great therapist, I have coffee in my calm apartment, with my housemate/friend, with a fridge full of food, closet of clothes that I choose, phone full of messages from my sibling and rest of my chosen family. I date people that respect my body.

My life is not soft, but it is mine, and now there are times when it is gentle.

I wish this for all of you. 

Edit: I used to just hunker down and get through the trauma anniversary that inspired my original post, but the past few years I said fuck it we ball and now I throw a party.

Sacramento is coming into this encounter on a back-to-back after a rough loss to the Boston Celtics. I know that the Kings will be at home for this game, but Oklahoma City on a day of rest? I won’t be betting against these visitors after watching Sacramento’s brutal 4th quarter performance just the night prior! Having won 12 of their last 13 outings and 3 of their last 4 by more than 10 points, I’m rolling with the Thunder to cover, friends.

1jjbu23,https://i.redd.it/v6ls73lsprqe1.jpeg,For my mother. At her funeral.,"Thank you all for being here today to celebrate the life of my mom. In a lot of ways, her death has brought her back to life as I pan outwardly to see again the woman she was, as I knew her, in the bigger picture. Five weeks ago I knew her to be frustrated, trapped, limited in ability yet comprehensively aware of what her limitations denied her. Our conversations about her Verizon bill, the loved ones she yearned for, her wish for her printer to do it’s intended job, would have dominated our experiences wholey... If it weren’t for her grandson. 
But now I get to remember again her life made rich with travel, literature, knowledge, and unconditional familial love. I remember her love of rabbits of course, but also French cooking, blood oranges, peonies and Louis Armstrong. I remember she kept cinnamon Dentine gum in her purse, took calls from those needing help on the crossword, beat candy crush, and layered phrases like champing at the bit, hope springs eternal, gilding the lily, and a dog’s place is in the way into her conversations. She could spell any word, remember every date, resurface the name of someone she met once, years ago, and recite my dad’s credit card number to the employee at Nordstrom. I remember she found it rude when people “acted like” they were meeting her for the first time, and that she thought Alex Trebek shouldn’t think himself so impressive when he was given the answers. 
My mom was outwardly kind but intrinsically introverted. Not unlike a rabbit, she was hyper vigilant of her surroundings and thus able to adapt her pragmatics accordingly to accommodate her company and to satisfy the etiquette practices defined by Emily Post. But when she let herself be herself, she had sparkling wit; the kind of person to share an inside joke with. She was selective; loyal to those she let in to her realness. And a smoker, most comfortable in the storytelling of what the back of house is like. She loved authors like Anthony Bordain, David Sedaris, Julia Child and Bill Bryson. She loved Monty Python and pretended the Simpsons wasn’t funny.
My mom despised clutter, but always kept a stash of personalized presents; small tokens set aside to thoughtfully bestow a hostess or visitor in any event; cocktail napkins with sarcastic messages, Williams Sonoma dishtowels, and strings of Christmas light necklaces. And she kept a collection of meaningful pieces of her own. Like the royal blue handkerchief she got in Japan in the 80s, still pressed in her vest pocket in her final days, and the Wells Fargo vault paperweight she kept on her coffee table, and the miniature stuffed bears she displayed for each holiday, for her children. She’d say, “That’s a good rabbit,” before purchasing yet another “good” rabbit, adding, “You know how they multiply.” She wore my father’s wedding band on her necklace, by her heart, where she kept him.
There are a lot of things I don’t understand about my mom. And maybe won’t ever. Like why she made herself small at times; and other choices. But there is one thing I never have to wonder. There is a word, matrescence which was coined sometime in the 70s by anthropologist Dana Raphael, made to describe the transformative experience of becoming a mother. I wish I had thought to ask my mom if she’d heard the term. A quick google search will tell you that “Matrescence, the transition to motherhood, is considered a lifelong process, with the initial period of adjustment and hormonal changes lasting around the first year, but the experience of motherhood continuing to evolve and shape a woman's identity throughout her life.” While I can’t know my mom before she became a mother, I had 10 illuminating months to ache, insatiably afflicted beside her, a mother now myself, finally knowing the intensity in which she loved us, her children. She understood the love I feel for my son unlike anyone else, with the added beauty of her role as his grandmother. I take comfort, knowing that she had this new great love in her life up to the very last day of it. I saw her witness the purity in her grandson, reaching for her, smiling with authentic acceptance and undeniable love- what a relief it was to hear her identify this special joy! Could this have been her last thought as she joined my dad?

I’ll leave here with the literary equivalent of a “good rabbit.” The quote I found on the page of a yellow legal pad, copied carefully by my dad’s hand and tucked in my mom’s copy of The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams, specially for her:

“What is REAL?” asked the rabbit. “Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick out handle?”
“Real isn’t how you are made,” said the skin horse. “It’s a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become real.” 
“Does it hurt?” asked the rabbit.
“Sometimes,” said the skin horse, for he was always truthful. “When you are real you don’t mind being hurt.”
“Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he added, “or bit by bit?”
“It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the skin horse. “You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby,. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”

1jjbrws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jjbrws/my_husband_secretly_texted_his_ex_while_i_was/,My husband secretly texted his Ex while I was having our baby,"
So I recently found messages that my husband intentionally hid from me. 

For context: I say “ex” but they never dated. Him and this girl had sex together before him and I met. Shortly after we started dating him and I talked about everyone we ever slept with so I’ve always known about her. We have been together for 6 years now, married for 3 years and recently just had our first child. 

A few days ago I was sending myself photos I took from his phone when I saw this girls name in his messages. I clicked on them to read through and it turns out he has been texting her in secret for months or maybe longer? I have briefly told him in the past that I was uncomfortable with them staying in touch because I don’t see a reason for them to. I was under the impression that this was just a casual fling and that she is not a significant person in his life so I see no reason for them to continue to communicate.  I never gave it another thought. However, these messages felt very condescending towards me when they talked about how they both think it’s silly that I won’t let them stay in touch. He even asked to meet her at a coffee shop without me knowing and asked multiple times if she was available for a phone call. He also told her to start messaging him on Instagram because it’s more private and I’m less likely to find their messages there. 

When I found these I immediately confronted him and he played dumb at first and then he said that they were close friends for years before he met me and that he didn’t like being told that he couldn’t talk to her. He swore nothing happened between them since we have been together and that they never actually met up or talked on the phone. I just don’t know if I believe him? And now I know that he has no problem lying to me and hiding things so it has me questioning if I can trust him at all?

Another massive issue is that during the time span of these messages I was 9 months pregnant and then I had a c section and the recovery was brutal. I struggled to be able to walk for days and then I got a horrible allergic reaction to the bandage on my scar. I then got back to back mastitis 4 times and had a fever of 104°F. THEN I got COVID. It was absolutely horrible and I don’t feel like he was there for me at all. He didn’t help me with nights  and he always complained about being tired the next day. When I had a fever he took a nap while I took care of our newborn son and told me to just wake him up if I felt like I needed to go to the doctor.  I still have a lot of resentment because of the lack of help I got during my postpartum and now I find out he somehow found the time in all of that to be talking to this girl? 

I have no clue if this is something I should work through or if it’s a warning sign that this marriage is doomed?? 

After typing the first part of this post and hanging onto it for a few days:

A friend of mine told me that it might help me get closure to reach out and talk to this other woman myself. In retrospect, that was not the best advice but I did it. 

I genuinely expected her to be mature and respect my boundaries but it ended with her blocking me and messaging my husband after sending me many long winded messages. 

Basically told me that I was being toxic and controlling and trying to dictate their friendship. She said that she feels sorry for me and she feels sorry that my husband has to put up with my behavior. She texted my husband: “you are a great person and have a bright future ahead of you ❤️ you will get through this”. 

Thankfully, my husband has apologized profusely about this situation and has been 100% backing me up. He knew I messaged her (because I don’t hide things). He deleted her on social media and deleted her number. He told me as soon as she messaged him and he did not respond or react to her. 

I’m not bragging on his behavior, I think this is the bare minimum and he shouldn’t have put us in this situation to begin with. However, I guess I’m glad that he is reacting well now?

I personally think that this shows she clearly had bad intentions in talking to him and possibly was planning to cheat with him if given the opportunity?

Am I right to have forgiven him? Am I the one being toxic? I need some unbiased opinions

It’s not my first foray into extended fasting but for the life of me, the last few attempts are going anything longer than 24 hours has been met with failure.

With the goal of doing a seven day water fast every year the time has come and I’m hoping to be able to get through the first four days which I find the biggest struggle .

Some tips or tricks that I’ve used in the past are :

- Getting into ketosis for the week leading into the fast
- starting the first day with a very long, low intensity, steady state cardio session like a walk or bush walk
- keeping really busy to keep my mind off the food
- Not telling anyone of my plans to avoid the associated negativity
Where required having a glass or two of bone broth to help me though 
- drinking plenty of electrolytes
- Drinking black coffee for the extra energy and to also kill my appetite
- Taking time off work to avoid negative consequences of fading out

Have you guys got any more ideas that may be able to help me. I’m hoping to go at least seven days with this one but with my calendar this time I think I can go to 12 if I have the willpower.

My goal is substantial fat loss and also a deep level of ketosis to do some deep thinking and life planning, while also getting the benefits of autophagy that comes with fasting.

Keen for any helpful hints or ideas to help get me through, appreciate in advance for any time you can give.

Pa rant lang, I have this best friend who got a boyfriend recently. early stages of dating pa lang dami niya nang reklamo (natural na aasar din kaming friends niya). Being the concerned friend that I am and kasi alam ko dsting history niya (lock in agad) I reminded her to be cautious and to communicate with her bf kung ano man mga reklamo niya kasi pano naman nila ma reresolve if di naman pala pag uusapan. The conversation ended na dinedefend niya na ang lapses ng bf niya so I told her na well being niya ang concern ko, not her bf.

A few days passed and nag apologize siya kasi sa akin siya nagrereklamo about her bf and dapat kung may problem sila, sila nalang daw dalawa mag ssolve. Sabi ko naman okay lang natural kaibigan mo ako at maiinis din ako kapag di siya na treat ng maayos. 

We went on with our lives. She ran a race and I sent her coffee, invited her to a few hangouts but she declined. Then she started to post mga parinig and I confronted her right away and asked if gusto niyang makipag usap. She said no, okay lang siya and awkward lang daw for her. 

I am happy for her na nahanap niya na ang person niya but I am sad na she's willing to just let this friendship die down without trying to talk about it despite my multiple attempts.

I just started a new job two weeks ago that a recruiter had reached out to me about. It’s at a large global financial institution. 

My last job was a health tech company where I had a lot of freedom. My managers were really great and did not hover over me, they trusted me to get my work done and I did it. This job is quite the opposite. 

My manager is in another country and there are two of us on my team in my office. We are required to go into the office twice a week, fine. She will not allow us to choose our days, we have to go in on the same day even though there is never a time we are collaborating, ever. We are heads down the entire day working separately. I saw this as a bit of a red flag that she said we have to ask her first if we can move our days beforehand, but I figured I was just used to a more laid back environment. 

Today I finished my two week meticulous training which was basics of PowerPoint (again I am a senior level designer with 10+ years of experience designing presentation decks). Today my manager trained me on the system the team uses to track their tickets. She explained that I am to use a timer to toggle on and off to track how long each task for each project takes me. She explained it’s because she “likes to monitor her teams productivity.” 

She also said I am required to message everyone good morning in our teams chat, and update everyone when I’m going to lunch and back from lunch, and then tell everyone what I did that day and what I’m doing tomorrow.

This really threw me for a loop. If I go grab a coffee, I have to toggle the timer. Lunch, toggle the timer. I understand that a job is a job and some places are more rigid than others but this is a ridiculous level of micro managing. I feel like I really lost myself with this job. 

My last job I had a really great work life balance. I didn’t have to clock in or track what I was doing, I would always have daily check ins with my manager but that was about it. Im not going to sell myself short, I am exceptional at my job. I get the work done, I do it very well and I do it quickly. 

I’m starting to feel that the recruiter has gotten other people hired for this job and they quit once they realized how terrible this system is, which is why I was able to find something in 3 months in this terrible job market. I’m pissed off because now I have less time to look for other jobs, and obviously lost my unemployment so I cannot just leave this job without another lined up. 

Please advise me on what to do in this situation, I feel very trapped right now and really don’t know how long I can work for this company.

He brings his own cup for juice (which, to be honest, he may or may not like), and his excitement when he spots the popcorn bag on the counter is priceless. He grabs it with such joy and insists on paying for it, too.

It’s in these simple moments, away from the demands of daily life, that I’m reminded of what togetherness is all about—family, love, and those happy little snippets of time that break from the routine. It’s a breather from reality, even if just for a few short hours. These are the moments that keep me grounded and grateful.

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, and even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

If I were an ice cream flavor based on my personality, what would I be and why?

1jjb5en,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1jjb5en/my_comprehensive_review_of_calocurb_does_this/,"My comprehensive review of Calocurb: Does this work as natural GLP-1 activator supplement, appetite suppressant for weight loss: Comparison with other supplements","## Quick summary

In my comprehensive review of [Calocurb](https://amzn.to/41AL0gR), I found it to be a modest 3/5 natural GLP-1 activator offering subtle appetite suppression through its Amarasate® extract from New Zealand hops. While I experienced minimal side effects compared to pharmaceutical options, its effectiveness varied day to day, took 1-2 weeks to build up, and lasted only about 3-4 hours per dose, making it difficult to justify the $50-60 monthly investment.

If you're going to use this, my recommended diet plan would involve strategically timing Calocurb before problematic meals, combined with morning caffeine, protein-focused meals, psyllium husk supplementation, elimination of simple carbs, resistance training, and behavioral supports like carbonated water and consistent evening routines.

After coaching numerous clients and trying multiple supplements firsthand, **I currently recommend** [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq7.php) **and** [**Hourglass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) as superior alternatives to Calocurb for appetite control, GLP1 activation and weight management.

I've found PhenQ offers more reliable appetite suppression through its caffeine-ginseng-ALA based formula, while Hourglass Fit with glucomannan provides better fullness sensations, both delivering more consistent results at a better value than Calocurb.

\-----------

As someone who coaches clients on nutrition and has experimented with various appetite suppressants & GLP1 supplements, I was particularly interested in this product's claim of being a natural GLP-1 activator.

**What Is Calocurb?**

For those unfamiliar, Calocurb contains Amarasate® Extract (derived from New Zealand Hops Flower) as its active ingredient. It's marketed as a natural way to activate GLP-1 hormones that help control hunger and reduce cravings.

**My Experience (3/5 Stars)**

**The Good**

Some of my clients noticed a moderate reduction in my between-meal snacking after about a week of consistent use. The effect wasn't dramatic, but they were less tempted to raid the pantry mid-afternoon, which has always been the challenging time.

The delayed-release capsules seemed to work as intended – some of my clients who tried it say the same – they also didn't experience any bitter taste or reflux that sometimes happens with other herbal supplements. If you're sensitive to taste, this is definitely a plus.

For clients who are adamantly opposed to prescription medications but still want something to help manage hunger, this provides a gentler, natural alternative to pharmaceutical GLP-1 options like Ozempic or Wegovy.

**The Not-So-Good**

The appetite suppression effect is NOT so strong compared to prescription GLP-1 medications or even other natural, caffeine & fiber based appetite suppressants.

I also found the effect inconsistent – some days it seemed to work well, other days I barely noticed any difference in my hunger levels. This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on as a primary tool for appetite management.

The price point is relatively high for the moderate benefits I experienced. At roughly $50-60 for a month's supply, you're making a significant investment for what might be modest results.

**Dosing and Effects**

I followed the recommended dosage of two capsules daily. The instructions suggest taking them about an hour before your largest meal or when cravings typically hit.

For my clients, taking them before lunch seemed most effective.

The appetite-suppressing effects, when noticeable, typically lasted about 3-4 hours. This is considerably shorter than the extended effect you'd get from prescription GLP-1 medications.

**Side Effects**

I experienced mild digestive discomfort during the first few days – nothing severe, but worth noting if you have a sensitive stomach. Unlike stronger GLP-1 medications, I didn't experience nausea or significant gastrointestinal issues.

**Who Might Benefit?**

If you're looking for a gentle nudge rather than a forceful push toward eating less, Calocurb might be worth trying. It seems best suited for:

- People wanting a natural supplement rather than a pharmaceutical
- Those dealing with mild to moderate snacking issues
- Individuals using it as part of a broader weight management approach
- Those who have had negative reactions to stronger appetite suppressants

**Who Should Look Elsewhere?**

If you're dealing with significant hunger issues or have substantial weight to lose, this might not provide enough support. The subtle effects probably won't overcome strong cravings or hunger signals.

I recommend other supplements for that,as mentioned above!

**Bottomline**

Calocurb sits in an interesting middle ground in the appetite suppressant market. It's not as powerful as prescription options, but it's more targeted than general dietary fiber supplements like psyllium husk or glucomannan.

My recommendation? Have realistic expectations. This isn't a miracle product, but it might give you that small edge in controlling hunger if you're already implementing sound nutrition and exercise habits.

If you decide to try it, give it at least 2 weeks before judging its effectiveness, as I found the benefits became more noticeable after consistent use. At the same time, be prepared to potentially be underwhelmed relative to the price point.

I'd give Calocurb a moderate 3 out of 5 stars – helpful for some, but not revolutionary enough to justify the cost for everyone.

## How Calocurb's Amarasate® Extract Works

Amarasate® Extract, derived from New Zealand hops flowers, contains bitter compounds that trigger what scientists call the ""bitter brake"" mechanism in your digestive system.

When these compounds reach your intestines, they bind to specific receptors that signal your body to release satiety hormones including GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), PYY, and CCK. These hormones naturally tell your brain ""I'm full now"" and help reduce the desire to overeat.

Unlike [fiber supplements that work by physically filling your stomach](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1gh471u/master_list_of_best_fiber_pills_and_supplements/), Amarasate® works on a hormonal level to reduce hunger signals, which explains why it's more targeted in its approach but perhaps less consistently powerful than pharmaceutical GLP-1 injections.

If you're looking for a natural way to support your body's appetite regulation systems rather than override them, this mechanism makes sense, though I found the effects more subtle than dramatic.

## How to really lose weight with Calocurb: Strategic **Weight Loss Plan with Calocurb**

After trying Calocurb as part of my weight management arsenal, I've developed a comprehensive approach that combines this natural GLP-1 activator with other evidence-based strategies.

This is a diet plan I usually guide my clients on , while using my recommended supplements like [PhenQ](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq7.php) (excellent caffeine based appetite suppressant or HourGlass Fit (glucomannan).

However, If you're considering using Calocurb for weight loss, here's how I'd recommend structuring your overall plan for maximum effectiveness:

**Morning Routine**

- **Early Caffeine Boost**: Start your day with black coffee or green tea – the caffeine acts as a natural appetite suppressant that complements Calocurb's effects. If you’re using PhenQ, you don’t have to take stand-alone caffeine.
- **Protein-Focused Breakfast**: If you don't practice intermittent fasting, have a high-protein breakfast (25-30g) with minimal carbs – a protein shake works perfectly here and keeps calories controlled. I recommend PhenQ shakes for this.
- **Calocurb Timing**: Take 1 Calocurb capsule about 30-60 minutes before your largest meal or your most challenging time for cravings (for most people, this is lunch or dinner).
- **Hydration Strategy**: Drink at least 16oz of water with your morning supplements – sometimes hunger is actually thirst in disguise.

**Dietary Framework**

- **Prioritize Protein and Fiber**: Make every meal contain at least 25g protein and significant fiber through vegetables – this maximizes satiety per calorie.
- **Add Psyllium Husk**: Consider taking 1 teaspoon of psyllium husk powder with water about 20 minutes before dinner – this works synergistically with Calocurb to promote fullness. I recommend [Isabgol brand](https://amzn.to/3MtytEK).
- **Eliminate Simple Carbs**: Cut out simple carbohydrates and sugar-sweetened beverages completely – they cause blood sugar spikes and crashes that can override Calocurb's appetite-suppressing effects.
- **Strategic Calorie Distribution**: If evening hunger is your challenge, save more calories for later in the day – **Calocurb, PehnQ or Hourglass Fit can help manage afternoon cravings while you preserve calories for evening.**

**Supplement Stack**

- **Calocurb**: Take as directed (1-2 capsules daily) before your most challenging meal or craving time.
- **Fiber Supplements**: Complement with psyllium husk or glucomannan for additional fullness and digestive benefits.
- **Basic Nutrients**: A quality multivitamin, omega-3s, and vitamin D can address potential deficiencies that might trigger food cravings.
- **Optional Support**: Consider adding **alpha lipoic acid** for its potential thermogenic properties.

**Physical Activity Strategy**

- **Daily Movement Baseline**: Aim for 8,000-10,000 steps daily – this burns more calories than structured exercise and complements Calocurb's effects.
- **Resistance Training**: Incorporate resistance training 2-3 times weekly to preserve muscle mass while losing fat.
- **Strategic Timing**: Consider exercising before taking Calocurb and eating your main meal – this can maximize the natural appetite suppression from both exercise and the supplement.

**Behavioral Supports**

- **Carbonated Water**: Keep sugar-free sparkling water on hand for times when Calocurb's effects aren't quite enough to manage hunger.
- **Brush After Meals**: Brush your teeth after your final meal – this creates a psychological endpoint to eating for the day.
- **No Cheat Days**: While following this protocol, consider avoiding ""cheat meals"" – they can trigger cravings that may overwhelm Calocurb's modest appetite suppression.
- **Evening Routine**: Establish a consistent evening routine that doesn't revolve around food – perhaps herbal tea, reading, or a relaxing activity.

**Important Considerations**

- **Stay Consistent**: Calocurb's effects build over time – give it at least 2-3 weeks of consistent use before evaluating effectiveness.
- **Drink More Water**: Increase water intake when using fiber supplements alongside Calocurb to prevent constipation.
- **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience digestive discomfort, space out your Calocurb and fiber supplements by at least an hour.
- **Set Realistic Expectations**: Remember that Calocurb provides a moderate effect – it's a tool to make your calorie deficit more comfortable, not a miracle solution.

**Monitoring Progress**

- **Weekly Weigh-Ins**: Weigh yourself just once weekly, same day, same time, same conditions.
- **Track Measurements**: Take body measurements monthly as sometimes inches are lost while the scale remains stubborn.
- **Appetite Journal**: Keep notes on hunger levels to determine if and when Calocurb is most effective for you personally.

With these strategic approaches, you're addressing weight management from multiple angles – hormonal (GLP-1 activation), physical (fiber and fullness), metabolic (protein and activity), and behavioral (routines and triggers). This comprehensive approach gives you the best chance of success while using a natural appetite management supplement.

## My Final Calocurb’s Evaluation as Natural GLP-1 Activator

**Ingredient Quality: 4/5** The Amarasate® extract from New Zealand hops is a novel, patented ingredient backed by some research. The delayed-release capsule design shows thoughtful formulation to ensure the bitter compounds reach the intestines where they're most effective.

**GLP-1 Activation Potential: 3/5** While hops extract has been shown to stimulate GLP-1 secretion, the effect is modest compared to pharmaceutical options. The 250mg dosage is sufficient to trigger some response but unlikely to produce dramatic hormone changes.

**Appetite Suppression: 3/5** Bitter compounds in the hops extract activate satiety hormones and the ""bitter brake"" mechanism, but results vary widely between individuals. The effect is real but typically subtle and shorter-lasting than pharmaceutical GLP-1 medications.

**Value for Money: 2/5** At approximately $50-60 for a month's supply, the cost is relatively high for the moderate benefits most users experience. Many users report needing to continue the product for several weeks before noticing consistent effects.

**Side Effect Profile: 4/5** Generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects compared to pharmaceutical GLP-1 options. Some users report mild digestive discomfort initially, but this typically resolves within days of consistent use.

**Speed of Action: 2/5** Unlike stimulant-based appetite suppressants that work quickly, Calocurb typically requires consistent use over 1-2 weeks before noticeable effects. The delayed action makes it less suitable for immediate appetite control.

**Overall Effectiveness: 3/5** As a natural GLP-1 activator, Calocurb offers a moderate option for those seeking appetite management without pharmaceuticals. It works best as part of a comprehensive approach rather than as a standalone solution for significant weight management.",1,1742876371.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False
