1opgxof,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1opgxof/multiverse_unique_crews_fun_facts/,Multiverse unique crews fun facts,"Hi. Quick post for people who enjoy Multiverse's worldbuilding and characters.

I really like Multiverse's unique crews. Some of them are really interesting/fun, and I always enjoy using the option ""talk to your crew"". 

But for those who don't know: when you have two unique crews or more, they can have interactions between theme.

Since I have some free time, here are a few interesting dynamics/infos about the unique crews interracting with each other. 


- The free Mantis who helped Tully escape the Hive's prisonner camp is actually Freddy. And it's actually Tully who gave Freddy his name. 

- Night and Tuco are best (drinking) buddies. They interact 3 times with each other, which is the record.

- When you talk to Dessius, he confesses having being defeated twice in duel. But during a friendly match against Devorak, he lost for the third time in his life. 

- According to Irwin, there is a second Saltman alive besides Obyn. 

- Jerry has the most interactions with other unique crew amongst everyone. He even managed to make Tony smile. 

- Though he is in debt to Vael, Billy Hektar is still richer than Tony, to the point where Tony actually finds it normal to make him coffee when Billy asks. 

- Despite the rivalry between the lost suns and the SSLG, Dianesh and Ariadne get along well.

- There are (only) two 3-sided interactions. One involved Anurak, Obyn and Sylvan, and the other Ariadne, Kazak and Mafan. 

- Ivar and Jerry are the two nicest guys. 

- Tuco taught Jerry a gambling game. Jerry then immediatly proceed to be better than him at it. 

- Tuco says that Ty E'Rel and him fought side by side and Ty E'Rel killed twice as many ennemies than him.",1,1762380624.0,ftlgame,0,1.0,False

1opgvwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expats_In_France/comments/1opgvwn/very_qualified_girlfriend_but_no_job_offer_in/,Very qualified girlfriend but no job offer in Paris,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out for some advice to help and motivate my partner, who’s going through a tough time right now. She just finished her second Master’s degree (both from top French Grandes Écoles), after completing a 6-month internship at Danone and a one-year CDD at L’Oréal. Unfortunately, that position didn’t turn into a CDI, and she’s now been unemployed for about three months.

She’s starting to feel really down and lose confidence. Coming from a very poor country, not earning any money puts her in “survival mode”: she avoids social outings like coffee with friends just to make sure she doesn’t spend anything and can keep what’s left of her savings.

In the last three months, she’s sent over a hundred applications and hasn’t received a single reply (just a few rejections). She has a vie privée et familiale visa through our PACS, so she doesn’t need a work permit. But the job market feels really tough right now, especially with the current economic situation and growing nationalism that makes it harder for foreigners to find stable work.

She has around six years of professional experience and is even ready to take junior-level jobs, since even the minimum wage in France is 10 times higher than her previous salary in her home country. Things have been hard, so I helped her find something temporary, she’ll start next week at UNESCO, doing an unpaid internship. She’s over 30, with two Master’s degrees and years of experience, so I feel sad that this is what it’s come to. But at least she’ll get out of the house, meet people, and (hopefully) regain some motivation while continuing her job search.

If anyone here has gone through something similar, or has tips to stay positive, keep confidence up, or make the job search in France more effective, I’d be really grateful for your insights.

She’s C2 in English and B1 in French. I’ve seen people on this forum mention being unemployed for over a year, and I’m genuinely worried that she might start feeling worse if things don’t move soon.

Thanks a lot in advance for any advice wishing everyone all the best!",1,1762380514.0,Expats_In_France,0,1.0,False

1opgu7r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opgu7r,How on earth do I arrange this open-ish concept living room,"I can't stand this open concept design. Thankfully I'm not putting a TV anywhere in here.

How do I arrange this without making one of the three couches feel excluded?

My previous arrangement had the two small couches in the corner by the kitchen making an L shape with an end table between them, and the coffee table was there too. Issue with that layout was the large couch was so far away from the others that I didn't like using it. I'd like to have all the couches feel like they're grouped together, but ultimately my priority is to have a small one paired with the large one. I really don't care about that single seater, it can do whatever it wants. I'm just so confused because there's zero layouts I can think of that work dimensionally.

1opgu4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1opgu4m/how_to_become_a_forestfriendly_home_protecting/,How to Become a Forest-Friendly Home: Protecting Biodiversity Through Everyday Choices,"Our forests are the lungs of the Earth — absorbing carbon, regulating climate, and providing habitat for 80% of terrestrial wildlife. Yet deforestation, mining, industrial agriculture, and biomass harvesting continue to erode these vital ecosystems. 

Every purchase we make and habit we change at home can help reverse this trend. Becoming a forest-friendly household means consciously reducing demand for products and practices that destroy forests while supporting those that protect and restore them.


Why Forests Matter

~ Forests store immense amounts of carbon, helping stabilize the global climate.

~ They regulate rainfall, purify air, and anchor soils that prevent flooding and erosion.

~ Forest biodiversity supports pollinators, medicinal plants, and thousands of species that keep ecosystems balanced.

~ Protecting forests also protects Indigenous communities whose livelihoods and cultural heritage depend on them.

Here’s how your choices can leotect our forests:


1. Address Agricultural Drivers of Deforestation

Over 70% of tropical deforestation is linked to agriculture — mostly livestock grazing and animal feed production.

~ Eat plant-based meals to reduce demand for soy and corn grown for livestock feed.

~ Buy shade-grown coffee and cocoa that preserve forest canopy habitats.

~ Support regenerative farms that avoid clearing new land and restore soil health.

~ Compost food waste instead of sending it to landfills, reducing methane emissions and enriching soil naturally.

Dietary change is one of the most powerful levers for reducing pressure on forests worldwide.


2. Choose Tree-Free Household Products

Replace tree-based paper goods with recycled or plant-based alternatives.

~ Paper towels: Use reusable cloth kitchen towels.

~ Toilet paper: Choose 100% recycled and unbleached or bamboo.

~ Tissues: Use handkerchiefs or 100% recycled tissues and boxes.

~ Notebooks and printer paper: Opt for 100% post-consumer recycled paper or tree-free paper (sugarcane, hemp, bamboo).

~ Napkins and wipes: Use washable cloth napkins and natural-fiber cleaning cloths.

Each of these swaps reduces the need for virgin wood pulp and helps protect primary forests from logging.


3. Limit Mining Impacts Through Conscious Consumption

Mining for metals and minerals devastates forest landscapes and watersheds.

~ Buy used or refurbished electronics and jewelry to reduce demand for new raw materials.

~ Recycle electronics properly at e-waste centers to recover valuable metals.

~ Support ethical brands that commit to fair-mined or recycled materials.

~ Advocate for stronger mining regulations that protect forest ecosystems.

Every time you repair, reuse, or recycle, you reduce the need for destructive extraction.


4. Oppose Biomass Forest Harvesting

Burning trees for energy may sound renewable, but large-scale biomass production is depleting forests and releasing stored carbon.

~ Support wind, solar, and geothermal energy, not biomass power plants.

~ Advocate against subsidies for forest biomass in your state or region.

~ Choose renewable electricity providers that exclude wood burning from their energy mix.

~ Spread awareness: many people don’t realize biomass energy often comes directly from clear-cut forests.


5. Support Reforestation, Conservation & Forest Justice

~ Donate to or volunteer with organizations protecting old-growth forests and restoring degraded ones (Rainforest Trust, One Tree Planted, Ecosystem Restoration Communities).

~ Plant native trees locally and advocate for urban canopy programs.

~ Buy FSC-certified wood and paper when you can’t avoid them.

~ Support Indigenous land rights movements, which are proven to protect forests more effectively than many government efforts.",1,1762380403.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

There are 8 of us in total, with myself and 2 others being more casual gamers with an actual full time job and responsibilities, and the other 5 being more ""hardcore gamers"".

Notably we are all between the ages of 25-34, most being around 27-29.

Anyways, every time we have a discussion about our days, plans in real life, etc., four of the five hardcore gamers seem to have a chip on their shoulder when literally anything about money is mentioned. For example, I will mention I'm going to a steakhouse for dinner and that I'm looking forward to it, and they will start saying ""There Pete goes again, bragging about going out to eat"". Or I will talk about a vacation I have planned and they'll say ""We get it buddy, you have a ton of money"". Basically anytime I say anything besides ""I stayed at home and watched TV / relaxed"" they seem to get triggered.

Last night I got fed up with this so I just sort of let them have it. Of the four hardcore gamers who constantly make remarks, two are unemployed and literally game 12+ hours a day, one works 15 hours a week at a gas station, and one does baby sitting only on the weekends. Mind you these are all men in their lates 20s or early 30s, who don't go to college and still have their parents pay their phone bills.

Basically I ended up telling them that my lifestyle is how most people's is, and that it's only because they're broke from their own laziness that they think I'm bragging about being rich.

Additionally, I brought up some of the things they've discussed in the group to further my point.

For example, one of the two unemployed guys has literally been wearing eye glasses that are the wrong prescription (not strong enough) for the last 2 years, as they felt spending $300 on new glasses was a waste of money. The other one complains about dating women to be impossible, despite the fact that he can't bring any woman to his house (since it's his parents house) or even go for coffee or a bite to eat since he literally has to wait for family members to gift him money even to buy $5 video games online.

TLDR: Broke gamer friends who are either unemployed or not applying themselves to earn money are constantly triggered by me talking about doing normal things like going out to eat, watching a movie in a theater, etc., I told them that they're only triggered because their failing in life due to their own laziness.",2,1762380240.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. What I miss most isn’t success or excitement — it’s peace of mind.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect.

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity.

***""NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE"": CRASH-LANDED SUSPECT SPARKING DELUSIONAL PANIC IN MIVALLI COUNTY FIELD***  
*Sheriff Mobilizes Manhunt for ""Lost"" Woman After Strange Object Found Near Local Wendy's*  
  
*Mivalli County, MT – Authorities are searching for a woman identified as Stella who reportedly fled the scene of a bizarre crash early Tuesday morning in a remote Mivalli County field. The incident involved an unusual, scorched metallic pod that witnesses say appeared to have fallen from the sky, landing mere yards from the highway and the local Wendy's.*  
  
*Mivalli County Sheriff Burt ""Big Hoss"" Hanson stated that the entire county’s resources have been mobilized to find the individual. ""We don't know who this woman is, or what she's capable of. The erratic nature of this incident and her subsequent disappearance means we are treating her as potentially dangerous until she can be safely detained and evaluated,"" Sheriff Hanson said in a press conference.*  
  
*Bizarre Witness Testimony*  
*The pod was discovered by local resident Brenda-Sue Jenkins, who was grabbing a quick bite when she noticed the unusual sight. Speaking from behind the police tape, Ms. Jenkins recounted a perplexing video call the suspect was having moments before fleeing.*  
  
*""She was talkin' to someone, usinn' some fancy drone,"" Jenkins told the Gazette, clutching her phone and a Target bag (and likely wishing she'd put on better shorts). ""The person on the call kept sayin' something about her crash landi'n on another planet and she kept insisti'n that she's on Gaia and how the guy was miles away on Earth. The woman—Stella, I guess—was believin' every word!"" The third party's encouraging of this delusion has fueled concerns about Stella's mental state.*  
*But Jenkins also proposed another theory: ""Well mayve that guy was her Ex. Hell I'd pretend I'm on the Oregon trail if Clytus was calllin' me""*  
  
*The Annoyed Landowner*  
*The mood at the crash site—now a hive of activity with police vehicles, K-9 units, and crime scene investigators (who wisely brought coffee and donuts to the scene)—was soured by the property owner.*  
  
*Farmer Jebediah ""Jeb"" Stone, who discovered the pod had obliterated a significant portion of his grazing land, was visibly annoyed as he spoke with Sheriff Hanson.*  
  
*""A pod! In my field! This is prime grazing land for my longhorns, and now I've got this scrap metal and a couple of white suits trampling my profits,"" Mr. Stone grumbled, pointing at the wreckage. ""I'm telling you, Sheriff, if that woman thinks this is 'Gaia' she can try pulling the hatch herself, but I expect compensation for every blade of grass!""*  
  
*Search and Safety Warning*  
*Sheriff Hanson stressed the urgency of the search, referencing Stella’s last known movements. ""Given the strange nature of this escape, we're not ruling anything out. We have helicopters searching the area, but she could be anywhere.""*  
  
*Hanson ended with a direct plea to the community: ""If you see Stella—and she is described as a young woman in a white space suit —do not, under any circumstances, approach her. Do not try to be a hero. Call 911 immediately. We just need to bring this lost lunatic in safely. And here is free advice, if you get lost, stay out, your last known location is were we start lookin'""*  
  
*The Mivalli County Gazette will update this story as the investigation progresses.*",1,1762380117.0,WFTS_Official,0,1.0,False

When I first met him, I didn't think much of it - he's objectively good-looking, but I wasn't particularly drawn to him. Over time though, as I got to know him better, I started to really like his energy. He's professional but warm, friendly with everyone, and genuinely easy to talk to.

When I was in his team, we'd chat and joke around a bit. He's complimented my storytelling and asked for hugs a few times (always light-hearted, not inappropriate). I moved to another team since, but still see him around occasionally. I once tried to grab coffee with him but he's in one of the busiest teams - hard to pin down, not just with me but in general. He's friendly when we bump into each other, but it's always in passing.

I've heard he has a bit of a ""ladies' man"" reputation outside of work, but he's never been anything but respectful and professional with me. The thing is, I don't know if he's just being nice or if there's mutual interest. It's tricky since we're in the same firm, and I still have about 8 months before I qualify.

How do you gauge interest in a professional setting like this - without crossing lines or risking awkwardness at work?",1,1762380041.0,Advice,3,0.67,False

I stare into the cup of coffee my partner made for me, as the milk dissolves a bit too slowly.

‘Are you sure the milk hasn’t expired? Does it taste okay to you?’

Addison, my partner smiles, taking a sip of their coffee to reassure me.

‘It’s fine, darling. Don’t overthink it. Hurry up, we have to head out soon or we will both be late.’

I nod, feeling my suspicion calm down a little bit, speeding my breakfast process up. I got incredibly lucky to have found such a sweet, reassuring partner, who never judges me for my overthinking. I could wake Addison up in the middle of the night and tell them the most atrocious intrusive thought that’s been eating at my brain, and they will give me a hug and repeat for the millionth time that it’s all in my head and not based in reality. 

Other people, however, aren’t as understanding. My excessively anxious and worried personality has become a subject of multiple jokes from family, coworkers and friends alike. Apparently, a grown man being scared of diving, petting stray animals, ordering food at new restaurants, squashing spiders, and picking up calls from unknown numbers is peak comedy to those around me. Maybe it does look ridiculous, but I’d rather keep myself safe than regret my recklessness.

Addison drops me off at my office building, waves me goodbye and drives off to their workplace, which is not far from mine. At work I keep my guard up probably even more than anywhere else. That being said, as much as I don’t like to admit it, my partner doesn’t get a break from my anxious texts even during our work hours. Usually I am able rationalize my suspicions and calm down after they send me reassuring texts. For example, if Brendan takes a few too many smoke breaks, or if Dean shields his phone screen from others a little too carefully, of course I will take note of it and message my partner my observations. But rationally I will always know that nothing truly suspicious is happening. My partner knows this too, they never freak out about my fears and just keep telling me there’s nothing to worry about, it’s all in my head and not based in reality.

However, today things seem particularly off, unlike usually. Doing my usual mundane tasks, I eavesdrop on Brendan and Dean having a conversation that seems to make sense on the surface level, typical small talk between two coworkers with a few jokes and cliche phrases sprinkled in… right? I listen closer, now looking right at them. Dean’s body language looks a little bit stiff, as if he has trouble bending his joints in a way he usually would. Whatever, maybe he’s just in pain. Maybe he worked out a little too much at the gym. Suddenly, it hits me. I pull out my phone and frantically text Addison: ‘You know how Dean has a stutter?’. 

They reply immediately: ‘Yes, what’s up?’. 

‘He’s speaking perfectly smoothly to Brendan right now…’

‘Aaron darling, are you sure you heard him correctly?’

‘Yes’

‘Maybe he went to speech therapy?’

‘And got these results in one day? Something isn’t right about him…’

‘Please try not to overthink it, it’s for your own mental health. Maybe he really did get his stutter fixed in one day. Please just keep me updated on you and tell me if something else happens.’

I try to let my partner’s words sink in and work their usual reassuring magic, but somehow my fear only intensifies as I listen to my coworkers’ talk, now paying attention to what they’re really saying.

‘I sure do get annoyed with my wife sometimes!’ Dean says with an unnatural cadence, following it up with a rhythmic, oddly paced laughter, sounding out every ‘ha’ with precision.

‘Aren’t you single though?’ I blurt out, now ending up the center of their attention.

‘Don’t you get it Aaron, I was just making a joke!’ Dean responds in that same tone, as if he’s being dubbed by a cheap text-to-speech software. 

It’s not just his stutter, or movements, or tone, it’s his crooked smile that stretches from ear to ear, making his face look like a mask imitating the real Dean. Pure, unadulterated dread starts to creep in and settles in my gut, piercing me and forcing me to sprint to the bathroom to get these feelings out. I lock myself in one of the stalls and stay there until there’s nothing left in my guts anymore, I’m hyperventilating and barely standing still. Granted, I have felt a lot of anxiety, fear and dread in my twenty-five years of life, but this is different. I don’t understand how Brendan seemingly hasn’t picked up on Dean’s odd behaviors, I almost envy his ignorance.

I linger in the stall for a little longer, sending Addison yet another text: ‘Something is definitely off with Dean. I’m taking a few days off from work stating tomorrow.’",1,1762379944.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

They make excellent points -like the pinned post- about how not to treat mute characters, but not how to have them be included.

The character in question is Cody, he’s a side character who has been summoned to another world with not even the clothes on his back. No one else knows sign language, but the MC will try to learn over the course of two books. 

Why is he mute? I was working at a coffee shop when I first started writing and a regular I’d serve was mute. He was really the inspiration behind the character and I enjoyed being around him, so I wanted to memorialize him in the story as I learned more about people with his condition.

At this point: Cody, the character, has occasionally written things in the dirt or communicated through physical cues like body movements and the like, but the issue I’m having is developing his personality outside of showing him nodding and gesturing to what other people are saying.

We see him getting frustrated at times when he’s unable to communicate effectively, and I’d like to touch on how alienating that can feel. 

He’s a competent character who’s likely my favorite and I just want to do him justice. 

If there’s anything that seems off with what I’ve written here, please tell me. 

If I were a more experienced writer I could probably work around it, but I really want to get him right.

TLDR: How do I have the character express his desires and be outgoing when he cant communicate and the tools to work around it are unavailable?

Chapter 1
I found out my boyfriend, Edward Ferguson, had just married another woman While we were making love.
""I can't believe you actually married the woman who dumped you back then. What about Esme? She's been so good to you. She loves you!"" his friend shouted.
""I'll stage a fake marriage with her later. She'll never find out."" Edward's voice was cold and impatient. ""You guys just need to keep my marriage to Eliza quiet, don’t let Esme know it.""
I swallowed back my tears. When Edward turned to look at me, I pretended I hadn't understood his Italian and forced a smile.
After he left, I took out my phone and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
***
Inside the Maybach, Edward kissed Esmeralda Wallace until she was breathless.
Her clothes were stripped away, while Edward remained perfectly composed in his suit. The stark contrast between them made her cheeks flush with embarrassment.
He pulled her close, chuckling softly by her ear. ""The partition's up. The driver can't hear, and he wouldn't dare listen. What are you so shy about, hmm?""
The elegant man who had always been calm and distant was now rough and unrestrained. Esmeralda wrapped her arms around him, her eyes brimming with love. Just as the wave of pleasure was about to peak, a sudden ringtone shattered the moment.
Annoyed by the interruption, Edward frowned, but when he saw the caller ID, he still picked up.
Gasping for breath, Esmeralda glanced at the name. It was his closest friend, Owen Vazquez.
""Eddie, have you lost your mind—""
Edward's brows furrowed slightly. In flawless Italian, he cut Owen off mid-sentence. ""This isn't the right time. Speak in Italian.""
There was a pause, then Owen's voice came through in Italian, tense and disbelieving. ""You really married Elizabeth? What the hell are you thinking? She dumped you when you went blind trying to save her. She left you for another man and nearly drove you to ruin! And now you're taking her back?""
The words were foreign, but Esmeralda understood every one of them.
When she finally grasped their meaning, a chill swept through her as if she had been plunged into ice.
Edward, oblivious to her reaction, replied flatly, ""If I don't marry her, her family will force her to wed an old man. I can't let that happen.""
""What about Esmeralda? Back when you lost your sight, she was the only one who stayed by your side. She's loved you for years. She practically gave you her heart. All of us have seen it!""
Hearing the barely restrained anger in his voice, Edward remained composed. ""I'll handle it. She'll never find out.""
""How long are you going to hide it from her? Forever? She's been waiting for you to marry her!""
The more he listened, the more irritated Edward became; his voice quickened. ""Keep my marriage to Eliza quiet. Don't breathe a word. I'll stage a fake marriage with Esme later.""
After hanging up, he didn't bother listening to another word from Owen.
He dropped the phone, pushed it aside, and turned his full attention back to Esmeralda beneath him.
She trembled in his arms. Even after they were done and redressed, she couldn't stop shaking. Just as she was about to speak, his phone chimed again.
It was a message notification from a special contact.
He glanced at the screen, then called to the driver.
""Esme, something urgent came up at work. I'll drop you off here. Take a cab home, okay?""
She didn't say a word. She simply nodded in silence and opened the car door.
The black Maybach shot off down the road, leaving her alone on the curb.
Esmeralda's tears finally spilled over as she watched the traffic blur past.
No one knew that to get closer to Edward, Esmeralda had secretly learned Italian long ago.
So she understood every word he and Owen had exchanged.
Each sentence still echoed in her mind like a thousand sharp blades, piercing deep into her heart.
And with that shattering realization, the memories she had buried for years came flooding back.
Edward was the heir born into privilege, while she was only the daughter of a maid.
That year, she followed her mother into the Ferguson family's grand manor and saw him for the first time. He sat under a shaft of sunlight, playing the piano with effortless grace.
She had never heard such beautiful music, nor seen anyone so breathtakingly perfect.
From that single moment, the name Edward was carved deep into her heart.
She never told anyone about the boy she secretly loved.
It wasn't just because of the vast gulf between their worlds, but because she knew Edward already had someone he liked.
His childhood sweetheart's name was Elizabeth Burton.
He cherished her and protected her like a precious jewel.
At 17, he lost his sight in a car accident while saving her.
But after that, Elizabeth vanished from his life completely. She never visited the Ferguson's manor, never called, and soon appeared on someone else's arm.
The Fergusons had other kids, and his parents, always tied up with work, had little time to look after their now-blind son.
So Edward was sent to live alone in the Ferguson's villa.
And it was Esmeralda who volunteered to go there and care for him for seven long years.
When she was 23, she knelt outside a renowned doctor's home for three days and three nights before finally convincing him to come out of retirement and cure Edward's blindness.
The fallen star regained his brilliance.
Within a year, he reclaimed his position as the heir to the Ferguson Group.
Through winter and summer, it was she who stayed by his side. It was she who kept vigil from dusk till dawn. It was she who endured those seven bitter years with him.
She was the one who kissed him, who held him, who shared his bed.
But she never imagined that the first thing he would do after regaining power was to marry the very woman who had once abandoned him—Elizabeth.
For years, she had worked relentlessly to keep up with his pace, to be worthy of standing beside him.
But no matter how much she changed, his parents never accepted her. They kept thinking she wasn't good enough for their son and even tried to pay her to leave.
Every time, Edward fought with his family for her sake. And because of that, she never thought of leaving him.
But it wasn't until today.
Today, Esmeralda no longer wanted to stay by his side.
She wiped her tears away, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
Chapter 2
On the other end of the line, Georgia Ferguson's voice trembled with excitement.
""You finally came to your senses? Good. A maid's daughter like you was never worthy of my son—the heir to the Ferguson family. Where are you now? Come over right away. We'll sign the contract.""
Staring at the address Georgia sent moments later, Esmeralda gave a bitter, mocking smile and hailed a cab.
At the café, Georgia questioned her about everything.
Esmeralda answered each question calmly, and when she was done, Georgia's expression turned satisfied. She took out a document and slid it across the table.
""It's all in writing. Once you sign, I'll transfer half of the money to your account immediately. The remaining half will be sent the day you leave. You must promise that once you take the money, you'll never show your face in front of Eddie again. Ever. Do you understand?""
Esmeralda's eyelashes trembled as she looked at the astronomical compensation figure.
She would never show up again.
In this life or the next, she never wanted to see Edward again.
Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name cleanly and decisively.
Georgia finally relaxed, putting the contract away as she stood up. Before leaving, she gave one last reminder.
""I'm giving you two weeks. I don't care if you can change your identity or move abroad. Just make sure Eddie never sees you again.""
""I understand, Mrs. Ferguson. You have my word.""
After watching Georgia leave, Esmeralda went home.
Ensuring Edward would never see her again was simple.
The Ferguson family had a long military and political lineage—none of their descendants were allowed to emigrate.
All she had to do was move overseas, and Edward would never be able to reach her.
She spent most of the night researching immigration options and finally decided on Australia.
After making up her mind, she picked up her phone to check the time, only to notice a new post notification on her social feed.
When she opened the post, it was a nine-photo collage from Elizabeth.
The top row showed her holding a bouquet of roses, the middle displayed three marriage certificates, and the bottom showed intertwined hands with matching rings.
Esmeralda knew that since Edward wanted to keep his marriage a secret, he would never have allowed Elizabeth to post it.
But she still did, and she had even set the audience to ""visible only to Esmeralda."" A deliberate show of triumph.
Esmeralda smiled faintly and gave it a like.
The moment she exited the app, a message from Edward appeared.
""Esme, I'm going on a business trip. I won't be home for the next few days.""
She replied with a simple ""Okay,"" put down her phone, and went to wash up.
The next morning, she got up early to start her immigration paperwork.
Since she was in a hurry, she applied for the expedited process.
The clerk assured her it would be completed within two weeks, and only then did she finally breathe a sigh of relief.
Once she got in the car, she scrolled through Elizabeth's social feed again.
This time, half of Edward's figure appeared in the photo.
The two of them were holding hands, touring a new house, and in the end, they had settled on a villa in South Bay Estates.
Just like yesterday, Esmeralda hit the like button.
On the third day, she went to her company and handed in her resignation.
After packing up her things and returning home, she saw yet another update—Elizabeth in a wedding gown, the diamond on her ring finger sparkling brilliantly.
As always, Esmeralda gave it a like, then buried herself under the covers.
The fourth day came, and when she woke up, her feed had another update.
This time, the photo was of the framed wedding portrait hanging in the couple's new home.
Esmeralda stared at it for a long while before snapping out of it.
She liked the post again, then put on makeup and went out to have a farewell dinner with a few close friends.
That evening, she returned home carrying several boxes and began throwing away everything connected to Edward.
All the gifts he had given her, their matching toothbrushes and cups, the photos they had taken together—every trace of him went into the trash.
By the time she finished, it was past midnight.
She was about to turn off the lights when Edward suddenly came home.
He froze at the sight of the half-empty apartment, his brow furrowing.
""Why does it look like half the stuff in here is gone?""
""I didn't like them anymore, so I threw them out. We can always buy new ones later.""
Edward nodded, tossing his jacket onto the couch, but his gaze landed on the boxes stacked nearby.
""You quit your job?""
He paused, then noticed the Social Security card sitting on the coffee table.
""Why did you take that out?""
""I've been tired lately and need a break, so I resigned. The card is for some paperwork I need to handle.""
She answered calmly, packing her things as she spoke.
Seeing how composed she was, Edward didn't suspect anything. Pulling her into his arms, he spoke softly. ""I've been swamped these past few days and haven't had time for you. Your birthday's coming up in a few days. How about I take you to the auction house tomorrow and let you pick something you like?""
Esmeralda didn't refuse.
The next day, as soon as they took their seats in the grand hall, she spotted Elizabeth.
Elizabeth sauntered up confidently and sat down right beside Edward.
All night, Edward kept his attention solely on Esmeralda, never sparing a glance to the side.
When the auction ended, he didn't linger. He simply took her hand and led her downstairs.
Before heading home, Esmeralda stopped at the restroom.
When she came out, she saw Elizabeth cornered on the staircase by a group of arrogant young men. Their mocking laughter echoed through the hall.
""Well, well, isn't this Ms. Burton? The one who dumped Edward after he lost his sight. Looks like retribution finally caught up with you, huh?""
""I heard your father's marrying you off to some dying old man. You're still decent-looking, though. How about you come with us instead? We'd take good care of—""
The rest of his words were cut short.
Edward appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression dark as thunder. Without hesitation, he kicked the men aside with ruthless force.
Chapter 3
Then Edward grabbed the man who had been leading the group, pinned him to the ground, and punched him over and over, mercilessly. Blood splattered; the men cried out, begging for mercy.
""I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson! Please forgive us and let us go!""
""Get lost! If I ever see you near her again, you'll deal with me personally!""
His furious roar sent the men scrambling away.
A crowd had gathered on the staircase, watching the scene unfold.
Edward ignored the stares and helped Elizabeth to her feet. ""Are you hurt?""
She fell into his arms, tears streaming down her face. ""My ankle hurts a lot.""
His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and pushed through the crowd, holding her close.
In the process of shielding her, his arm brushed hard against Esmeralda, knocking her backward.
Her head struck the sharp edge of a marble step with a sickening thud. Blood began to pour from the wound, making the onlookers gasp.
""She's bleeding! Someone call an ambulance!""
The pain was excruciating. Esmeralda's face twisted as cold sweat covered her skin.
Warm blood seeped between her fingers, dripping onto her eyelashes.
Through the haze, she saw Edward's back as he walked away without even turning around.
Once upon a time, when she had cut her finger while making soup for him, he had fussed for half a day. He insisted on calling a doctor as he was terrified it would scar.
She had teased him for overreacting, and he had lowered his head, kissed her hand, and said softly, ""Esme, you're the person I hold closest to my heart. When you get hurt, it hurts me more. Things are getting better now. You don't need to do all this yourself anymore. You will still have to wear the ring I'm going to give you. It wouldn't look right with a scar.""
Now she was bleeding in front of him, and he didn't even glance her way.
And that ring he had once promised her? It now glittered on another woman's hand.
The ambulance took Esmeralda to the hospital.
She registered herself, saw the doctor, picked up her medication, and went home alone. It was long past midnight when she was done.
That night, the pain kept her awake. She tossed and turned until dawn.
Edward never came home.
The next morning, she dragged her aching body out of bed to change her dressing and saw a new post from Elizabeth.
It was a video of Edward kneeling on one knee, gently massaging her ankle, and applying medicine.
Esmeralda watched it over and over, her eyes reddening before she eventually drifted into a restless sleep.
When she woke, the sky outside was already dark.
Her phone buzzed nonstop beside the pillow. She answered, and Edward's voice came through.
""Come to private room 703 at The Pavilion now.""
Esmeralda hesitated for a moment before getting out of bed.
After washing up, she quickly headed out.
When she pushed open the door, the first person she saw was Elizabeth.
Her eyes were red, her expression pitiful as if she were a fragile little rabbit.
Edward sat across from her, his face unreadable, the air around him heavy with tension.
Silence hung thick in the room until Esmeralda finally spoke.
""Why did you ask me to come here?""
Edward straightened in his seat, clasping his hands together with the poise of someone used to being in control.
""Esme, did you send those men from last night to harass her?""
Esmeralda froze.
Her eyes flicked to Elizabeth, catching the faint glimmer of satisfaction flashing in them.
In that instant, she understood everything. This was all Elizabeth's doing.
She gave a weary, ironic smile. ""No. I don't know those people, and I wouldn't waste my time doing something like that.""
Her calm explanation didn't change the darkness on Edward's face.
He lowered his gaze, his voice even but cold. ""Esme, when Elizabeth left me years ago, I let her go completely. You've been with me for seven years. You should know who's in my heart now. The Burton family has fallen on hard times, and everyone's eager to kick them while they are down. But you shouldn't be one of them. You don't need to make things harder for her because of me.""
His words hit her like a blade twisting deep inside.
Memories of him breaking down in the middle of the night, chasing after doctors, fighting for his sight, and the hopeless diagnosis that he would never see again flooded her mind.
The man, who was born with every advantage, had lost his sight completely for the sake of one girl.
Seven years of devotion, gone with a few indifferent words, as if they'd meant nothing.
She thought of the marriage certificate stamped with both his and Elizabeth's names. Her eyes burned with tears. ""You're right. We've been together seven years, and I'm only now realizing who you truly have in your heart.""
Edward frowned. ""What do you mean by that?""
Esmeralda shook her head with a bitter smile. ""I mean, I'm just a maid's daughter. Do you really think I'd have the money or the connections to hire people like that to humiliate an heiress?""
Even with her words laid bare, he still didn't believe her.
She was too tired to explain any further.
She took a deep breath and asked softly, ""If you don't believe me, just tell me what you want me to do.""
Edward rubbed his temple. ""Apologize. Esme, when you've done something wrong, you should say you're sorry.""
At that moment, Elizabeth, who had been sitting meekly to the side, finally spoke up in a soft, trembling voice.
""No need to apologize. If you truly feel sorry, drink these.""
Chapter 4
The table was lined with glasses of amber-colored whiskey.
Esmeralda's gaze lifted to Edward, searching his face for a clear answer.
But the lighting was dim, and his expression was unreadable in the shadows.
The silence was suffocating; every breath felt like it was draining the air from her lungs.
Her breathing quickened, and a flood of memories surged through her mind.
When she first moved into the Ferguson's villa, Edward, who was blind and bitter, had drowned himself in alcohol every night.
Worried about his health, she had tried to stop him, again and again, but he never listened.
One night, drunk beyond reason, he had sneered at her and pushed several bottles toward her.
""Even a maid's daughter dares to lecture me now? I really have fallen low. Fine. If you drink these, I'll do as you say.""
She had wanted to tell him that she wasn't trying to control him and that she was just worried.
But instead, despite being allergic to alcohol, she had picked up the bottle and drank without hesitation.
Minutes later, she was rushed to the hospital.
When she woke, he was sitting by her bed, his face dark and cold. ""I'm the one who was drunk, not you. You knew you were allergic, so why would you risk your life like that?""
She had only whispered, ""Because I care about you, Mr. Ferguson. Your eyes will heal someday. And even if they don't, I'll still stay with you. So please, don't give up.""
From that day on, Edward quit drinking.
For years after, there wasn't a single bottle of alcohol in the house.
Thinking of that now, Esmeralda smiled faintly, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.
Without explaining herself, she reached for the small packet of chili powder beside her and emptied it into one of the glasses. Her tone was steady, final.
""These few glasses hardly prove anything, do they? I'll take this as punishment. Will that be enough for you?""
Before anyone could react, she lifted a glass and drank it down, one after another.
The burning bitterness spread from her tongue down her throat, searing its way through her chest, stomach, and heart—everywhere he'd once lived inside her.
By the seventh glass, Edward finally lost his composure.
""That's enough!""
Esmeralda looked at the untouched glasses left on the table and let out a hollow laugh.
""Enough? So that means I've apologized properly? Have I pleased the woman you love now?""
At that, Edward stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist.
His usually emotionless face was dark with fury.
""You know that's not what I meant! Esme, I told you that there's nothing between me and Elizabeth anymore. My family doesn't want you marrying into the Ferguson family, and if you keep acting like this, they'll use it against you. I just don't want you to get hurt or be talked about!""
His words sounded righteous, even protective.
But to Esmeralda, they were nothing but excuses.
If the Ferguson family couldn't accept a maid's daughter like her, how could they possibly accept Elizabeth—the woman who had abandoned him?
And yet, despite everything, he had still married her.
Because when it came to love, he had always chosen her.
Esmeralda no longer wanted to argue. She yanked her hand free and turned toward the door.
But before she could take two steps, her body swayed, and everything went black.
""Esme!""
Edward's heart stopped. He lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground.
As he lifted her into his arms, Elizabeth's trembling voice rose behind him. ""Eddie, I feel dizzy...""
He froze for a second—but only a second.
Then he strode out without looking back.
""I'm taking Esme to the hospital. Call your assistant to take care of you.""
When Esmeralda opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital ward.
Edward, who hadn't slept all night, finally exhaled when he saw her open her eyes.
Their gazes met and lingered for a long time, neither of them saying a word.
He finally poured her a glass of warm water, tucked the blanket around her, then called the doctor to run another check and carefully noted every instruction.
He even canceled all his meetings, despite Donovan Nicholson waiting anxiously outside the door.
Watching that, Esmeralda finally spoke. ""You should go to work. I can take care of myself. This isn't something you need to do.""
His hand paused mid-motion, his voice soft but heavy. ""I should do it, Esme. Don't you remember? You were the one who used to take care of me like this.""
A flicker of confusion crossed her eyes.
Back then, when he had lost his sight and been cast aside by his family, she had stayed.
She had learned Braille to teach him, helped him read, took him for walks in the sun, and cooked all his favorite dishes.
It felt as if she had stolen a piece of the moon for herself. The once-dim world around her was filled with light.
Those seven years had been the happiest of her life.
But the moon was never hers. Now, she couldn't go back.
That afternoon, the doctor escorted her to the examination room.
Half an hour later, a nurse helped her back to her ward.
As she pushed the door open, she saw Edward holding her phone, his brow furrowed and his voice cold as he spoke to Georgia.
""I've told you before that Esme and I love each other. I don't care about her background. You can stop interfering. I'm going to marry her, and she's not leaving me.""
Hearing the sound, he looked up at her, and a moment later, Georgia's puzzled voice came through the phone.
""What do you mean she's not leaving? Didn't you know? Esmeralda already agreed to leave the country a few days ago...""

1opghmf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opghmf,Yoshikage Kira: The Quiet Bomb Maker,"Name: Yoshikage Kira (吉良 吉影)
Age: 33
Gender: Male

Title: Grade 1 Curse user

Appearance: Kira is meticulously well-groomed, impeccably dressed in custom-tailored, often light-colored suits that look expensive and utterly ordinary. He has neat, slicked-back blond hair. His most striking features are his calculating violet eyes and the air of utter, chilling normalcy he projects. He wears a high-end, classic wristwatch and keeps his hands flawlessly manicured. Unlike most Sorcerers, his clothing is designed to blend perfectly into an office environment, projecting the image of a successful, if bland, salaryman.

Personality: Kira's entire existence is dedicated to achieving a ""quiet life"", a life utterly free from stress, notoriety, or the attention of others. He is a genius of methodical efficiency and planning, applying the same rigor to eliminating threats (or people who annoy him) as he does to mundane tasks like cutting his fingernails. He holds an aesthetic appreciation for beauty, specifically the hands of women, and this has translated into a horrific serial compulsion. His calm is brittle; the moment his private life or true identity is threatened, he becomes fiercely protective and ruthlessly violent. His biggest weakness is his hubris; he believes he is smarter and more efficient than everyone else, leading him to occasionally indulge in unnecessary risks just to feel the thrill of getting away with it. He views Cursed Spirits as nothing more than obstacles to a peaceful life, and other Sorcerers as potential witnesses to his true nature.
CURSED ENERGY TRAIT:

Cursed Energy Trait: Aesthetic Precision
Kira’s Cursed Energy is not overwhelming in raw power, but its control is absolutely peerless. When shaping or applying it, his Cursed Energy has an uncanny ability to be deployed with zero leakage, no wasted motion, and perfect form. This trait makes his explosions incredibly focused and his traps practically invisible to conventional Cursed Energy detection. 

INNATE CURSED TECHNIQUE: Silent Detonation (静寂の爆発, Seijaku no Bakuhatsu)

Concept: His Innate Technique allows Kira to turn anything he touches with his palm into a ""Primary Bomb."" This object looks and functions normally until he wills it to detonate with a subtle internal implosion that turns into a massive explosion.

Technique Details:
 
* Primary Bomb (第一の爆弾, Daiichi no Bakudan): Kira can designate any single object he touches as an explosive. The object is consumed when it detonates, leaving no residue or evidence. He can only maintain one Primary Bomb at a time. Activating a new bomb automatically deactivates the previous one. The bomb is entirely undetectable by conventional Sorcerers or Cursed Spirits until detonation, thanks to his Aesthetic Precision trait which leaves no Cursed Energy signature on the object itself.
 
* The Silent Kill: The bomb's activation is a purely mental command from Kira. The explosion is initiated by a sudden, intense compression of space, followed by the outward blast. This unique mechanism is extremely effective against Cursed Spirits, as the implosion destabilizes the Cursed Energy that forms their bodies.
 
* Aesthetic Range: Kira is forced to touch the object with his actual hand (not just the Cursed Energy around it). The bomb can be detonated at any distance, but the further the range, the greater the toll on his focus and Cursed Energy reserves.

Extension Technique: Secondary Bomb: Sheer Heart Attack (第二の爆弾：シアー・ハート・アタック)
Ability: Instead of detonating the Primary Bomb, Kira can release a small, nigh-indestructible, tank-like shikigami made entirely of condensed, highly volatile Cursed Energy: The Sheer Heart Attack.
 
* Targeting: Once released, it has only one order: ""Find the hottest target and destroy it."" It possesses a rudimentary form of Cursed Sensing, allowing it to autonomously track the source of the highest heat signature (body heat, friction, fire, etc.) in the area.
 
* Properties: It acts as a fully autonomous, self-guided bomb. It cannot be seen or controlled by Kira once released, forcing him to be tactical about when and where he unleashes it. When it reaches its target, it explodes, consuming itself. Due to its nature as a condensed Cursed Spirit-like entity, it is highly durable and difficult to destroy before detonation.
 
* Weakness: Its single-minded focus on heat makes it easily tricked by thermal decoys or by Sorcerers who can mask their body temperature with Reverse Cursed Technique.

Extension Technique: Third Bomb: Bites the Dust (第三の爆弾：バイツァ・ダスト)
Ability: This is Kira’s desperate defense mechanism, activated when his true identity has been severely threatened or revealed to another person. It is a highly draining technique and can only be placed on a single non-Sorcerer host (usually a child or someone unremarkable).

 * Mechanism: It manifests as a microscopic Cursed Spirit placed inside the host's eye, invisible to all but the most powerful Sorcerers. If the host attempts to reveal Kira's identity, or if a Sorcerer attempts to extract information from the host, Bites the Dust instantly detonates, killing the host and any witnesses.

 * Time Reversal: Upon detonation, the technique triggers a localized time loop, rewinding time back by a variable duration (up to 24 hours). Everyone who witnessed or learned Kira's secret retains the memory of the detonation and the events leading up to it, but the memory of Kira’s identity is erased from them by the Cursed Technique.
 
* Fatal Loophole: The victims of the time loop die at the moment they attempt to reveal his identity in the new timeline, resulting in a series of repeated, unavoidable deaths until Kira calls the technique off. This is his ultimate way of ensuring his secret remains safe.

Maximum Technique: The Hand of Fate (運命の手, Unmei no Te)
Kira gathers and compresses his Cursed Energy into a terrifying, concentrated form and applies it directly to his own hands. For a fleeting moment, anything he touches—air, ground, or a person—is immediately rendered into a Primary Bomb without the need for a secondary mental command. This creates a chain of rapid, cascading detonations that wipe out everything in a wide area around him. This is his ""scorched earth"" option, used only when the pursuit of the ""quiet life"" is completely over.

Domain Expansion: A Tranquil Morning (静かなる朝, Shizukanaru Asa)
Description: Upon activation, a subtle, but perfect barrier is erected. The interior of the domain appears as a flawlessly ordinary suburban home's living room, bathed in a gentle, warm morning light. Everything is impeccably neat—the furniture, the newspaper folded on the coffee table, the vase of fresh flowers.

Sure-Hit Effect: Compulsory Primary Bomb Application

Within the domain, all matter, including the opponent's body and Cursed Energy constructs, is forcibly and instantaneously designated as a Primary Bomb. Kira no longer needs to physically touch an object or opponent. He only needs to issue a single, silent command.
 
* Lethality: Kira can detonate any part of the opponent's body with the same zero-residue, internal implosion effect of the Primary Bomb. He can pop an arm, a leg, or the head with frightening ease. The entire domain is a ticking minefield where the opponent is the bomb.

 * Weakness: Because the domain's power is so absolute in its forced application, it requires Kira to use his meticulous Cursed Energy control to precisely target which ""bomb"" (which part of the body or which object) to detonate. Any distraction or sudden, chaotic movement can momentarily overwhelm his focus, giving the opponent a narrow chance to attack.",2,1762379608.0,CTsandbox,1,1.0,False

When I first met him, I didn't think much of it - he's objectively good-looking, but I wasn't particularly drawn to him. Over time though, as I got to know him better, I started to really like his energy. He's professional but warm, friendly with everyone, and genuinely easy to talk to.

When I was in his team, we'd chat and joke around a bit. He's complimented my storytelling and asked for hugs a few times (always light-hearted, not inappropriate). I moved to another team since, but still see him around occasionally. I once tried to grab coffee with him but he's in one of the busiest teams - hard to pin down, not just with me but in general. He's friendly when we bump into each other, but it's always in passing.

I've heard he has a bit of a ""ladies' man"" reputation outside of work, but he's never been anything but respectful and professional with me. The thing is, I don't know if he's just being nice or if there's mutual interest. It's tricky since we're in the same firm, and I still have about 8 months before I qualify.

I am also morbidly obese and while I don't have any health issues related to that yet, I am only 30. I need to lose weight and a big part of that is my diet. I have an extreme love/hate relationship with food. I hate it with a passion, unfortunately my body does not agree with me. 

Here are the issues i'm dealing with.

Munchies- I love munching over full meals. Tried to replace that with gum only to be told that chewing large amount of gum is almost as bad as the dang M&Ms. 

No fresh fruits/veggies- can't take them over the border and it is very hard for me to get a semi truck into the Walmart parking lots. Fresh fruit/veggies or what I can find at truckstops. (no problem in the US, the ones in Canada suck and I say that as a Canadian)

HATE cooked veggies- everything about them. The exception is potatoes but I've been told they don't count as a vegetable. 🤬

No eggs/any kind of bird product - avian flu, cooked or raw does not matter, if it's a bird product most of the time it can't be taken over the border. I sometimes get hard boiled eggs at the truck stop. (again, only in America cause the Canadian ones suck) 

Most meal prepping - no freezer/only a small fridge. Not sure I could run a microwave in this truck. 

Things I have tried:

Protein shakes in the morning- I buy them by the box and have one in the morning for breakfast.

Protein shake plus one meal a day with cheat day on Saturday- try to keep it as close to 1000/cal a day. Been doing it for a month and a half and nothing has changed other than I feel more shaky. 

Things I have tried and given up on because I've been told or wrong - Dried fruit has too much sugar in it/ anything healthy is taken out by the drying process   

seeds- sunflower/peanuts/cashew have too many calories and fat. 

Yoghurt and granola have too much of everything not healthy in it. 

Dried meat- too much salt

I am very much so a person of habit and I am quite happy eating the exact same thing for weeks if not months or years at a time. 

The only good thing about this entire mess is that I have never drank pop/coffee. Water all the way   ",1,1762379569.0,healthyeating,0,1.0,False

They're metahumans, and they're here among us. Many of them just want to live their lives undisturbed, but some will use their abilities to show they are superior to ordinary humans, while others will use their abilities to fight against them. Unbeknown to all, the very genesis of metahumans lies in an otherworldly event that took place more than a century ago - and those who caused that event are still here.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCERPT **(content warning: involves 9/11 attack)**

Captain Thomas Handler took a sip of his coffee and swiveled his chair to look out the window. Handler’s office looked out onto the parkway. Sun glinted off of the river of automobiles on the road. Hearing a step behind him, he turned back to find Brett Johnson, his adjutant, in the door.

“Sir? Something’s up.”

“How so?”

“Some passenger jet hit a building in New York, and we just got a confirmed report that Andrews has scrambled F-16s. Four total. Two headed for the Pentagon and two running patterns over the Mall.”

“What? What does that have to do with a passenger jet in - ” 

Handler’s voice trailed off as his eye was caught by all of the television monitors on his wall suddenly shifting to display a familiar face: the President of the United States. Handler raised an eyebrow. He knew this President to be a man who would not idly call for a nationwide address. Back when he and the President had been cocky young pilots, he’d been the chief executive’s wingman. Over the years, something of that rapport between the two men had been maintained, with the President often calling upon him as a sounding board. The relationship - and having the ear of POTUS - certainly hadn’t hurt his career in Naval Intelligence. Cursing under his breath, Handler fumbled for the remote to control all the screens and unmute the volume.

“Good morning.” POTUS began. “This morning, our fellow citizens, our way of life, and the very freedom which forms the bedrock of our country were attacked in a series of deadly terrorist attacks. 

At 7:59 A.M. this morning, American Airlines flight 11 departed Boston Logan Airport, bound for Los Angeles. United Airlines Flight 175 departed Boston Logan for Los Angeles fifteen minutes later. We know both of these flights were hijacked shortly after takeoff.”

The screen displayed a passenger jet partially submerged in water.

“The hijackers diverted the planes' flight path towards New York City after gaining control. These hijackers aimed to fly planes into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center as part of a premeditated and deadly terrorist attack.

A passenger on Flight 11 thwarted the hijackers' attempt. At the current time, this passenger’s identity is still unknown. I will speak more about this individual and their actions in a moment. Flight 11 made a successful emergency landing in the Hudson River. All seventy-six passengers and nine of the flight crew survived. Many of those aboard are being treated for injuries sustained during these events. Tragically, the hijackers took the lives of two flight crew members before the emergency landing.”

The President paused, and Handler saw what the Commander-in-Chief was about to say was tearing his heart apart.

 “Tragically,” continued POTUS, “the hijackers on Flight 175 were able to achieve their goal, and the plane crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 A.M. All 56 passengers, as well as 11 crew members and an unknown number of terrorists, are assumed to have perished instantly. Initial indicators are that hundreds of occupants of the tower have died as a result of the collision. First responders are on the scene, and evacuation of the tower is the top priority.”

The view onscreen changed to footage of a passenger jet—a *Boeing 767,* Handler thought—flying into the South Tower. The plane exploded, releasing a massive plume of black smoke. The murmur of voices from the operations center–a backdrop until this point–suddenly ceased.

“Authorities were able to identify a third flight, American Airlines flight 77, which had departed from Dulles International Airport at 8:20 A.M., had its own set of hijackers. Our Air Force scrambled F-16 fighter jets from Andrews Air Force Base to intercept Flight 77, and a few minutes before I began addressing you, we were able to force it out over the waters of Chesapeake Bay, where it crashed. Rescue operations are underway, but as yet, we have no word on the conditions of the 58 passengers and six crew members, nor of whether the hijackers survived.”

The President bowed his head for a moment, then continued.

“There is a reason we were targeted for this attack today. America is a beacon for opportunity and freedom, whose light shines even into the world's darkest corners. Today, some of that darkness came to us, seeking to blot out the light. And although tonight there will be mourning across the land, although tonight we as a country will mourn the victims of these attacks, every citizen should take comfort in knowing these terrorists could not drown out the light with the darkness of black evil. The light shines even as I speak to you, in the form of our first responders who dashed into the South Tower, in the form of every person who is already on their way to give blood or pass out blankets, to help in any way they can.

Make no mistake, we will find those responsible for these attacks. Already, I have directed our intelligence and law enforcement communities to devote every resource they have toward finding those who committed these monstrous acts. Justice will come for those responsible. We will make no distinction between these terrorists and those who harbor them. To you evil men who have attacked us and murdered our people, I say this: you have already slept your last peaceful night on this earth. 

I want to take a moment now to talk to you about the individual who prevented the terrorists on Flight 11 from reaching their goal. From the limited information we have, we know a female passenger onboard the plane thwarted the terrorists. This woman displayed specific abilities that fall outside the normal range of human capability.”

 The screen split, and footage began to play. Handler leaned forward as what was obviously a cellphone video unfolded. The sound was choppy and useless but sufficient to make out yelling and screaming. The footage was far from high definition, but it was clear enough to make out a Middle Eastern man brandishing what looked like a boxcutter. Something like a silvery string suddenly moved incredibly quickly toward the man’s wrist. There was a howl of pain, and the hand was no longer attached to his arm. The spray of blood shooting out from the wrist was easily recognizable as an arterial spray. 

The camera shook violently, and then the angle changed. A woman's shoulder and long, dark hair suggested the camera was looking over her shoulder. Whoever she was, she was facing another dark-skinned man, again holding a boxcutter, this one seemingly stained with blood. He barked something at her, and one of her hands came into the frame; again, a shiny string moved, this time surrounding the terrorist’s head in a silvery, undulating bubble. He dropped the boxcutter from his hand and raised both hands to his face, his mouth opening and closing in a universal sign of drowning. 

With a start, Handler realized the bubble was water. Somehow, the woman in the video controlled water!

“As footage captured by a passenger’s phone camera shows,  this woman used extraordinary abilities to disarm and disable the terrorists methodically. Eyewitnesses agree this woman's swift and brave intervention is responsible for saving the lives of passengers and crew. With the terrorists on Flight 11 failing to crash the plane into one of the towers, she also saved hundreds of lives within the World Trade Center.”

Now, the President stared directly into the camera.

“We owe a debt of gratitude to this citizen for exercising her incredible abilities. In the aftermath of these terrible events, our intelligence community has informed me of reliable reports from the United States and abroad about individuals who appear to possess gifts defying  known laws of physics and biology.

The footage changed, showing multiple windows where different people were displayed. Some were lifting heavy objects, making incredible leaps, or performing other amazing feats.  

“We know little about these individuals yet,” continued the President, “but I want to assure you first and foremost that, like the heroic woman on Flight 11, they are people just like you and me. They are your neighbors or perhaps your dry cleaners. They are family and friends. 

There will be those who label what these individuals can do as dangerous or evil. I implore you to remember they are people, regardless of any so-called “superpowers” they may possess. My scientific advisors have informed me the correct term to describe these people is “metahuman” or “meta.” In the weeks and months to come, we, as the American people, will need to grapple not only with evil, despicable acts of terror. We must have open minds and hearts as we wrestle with what the emergence of metahumans means for all of us. I urge you, fellow citizens, to be calm and empathetic as we seek to understand. For those of you listening who are metahumans, I urge the same. When confronted with the new, many people are frightened and act in ways not characteristic of their normal behavior. 

I will be meeting with Congressional leadership, the directors of the intelligence community, and others as we feel our way forward in light of the events and revelations of this day. May we all embrace the new, and may God bless America!”",1,1762379515.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False
1opgfrw,https://v.redd.it/r5xkjzzzeizf1,Time: Does It Deteriorate or Beautify a Smile?,"
The passage of time doesn’t just wear down a sculpture, it also fills it with history. Every crack in the marble, every change in texture, every new shadow created by erosion gives it character, depth, and a soul that makes it unique. The same happens with a smile.

When a smile is young, it’s vibrant, fresh, flawless. But over the years, it changes. It wears down, teeth may lose volume, and the color becomes tinged by life: the morning coffee, the shared laughs, even stress leaves its mark. But that doesn’t mean it loses beauty; it just transforms.

Some people see aging as an enemy, a battle to be won at all costs. But I see it differently: a smile that has lived is a smile with history. The expression lines around the lips, the slight irregularity on the incisal edges, the way the teeth reflect light differently—these are all part of a map of time.

However, unlike a marble sculpture, a smile doesn’t have to resign itself to wear. Modern dentistry allows us to restore without erasing its essence. We can rejuvenate a smile without taking away its story, returning vitality without losing its authenticity.

Because the true beauty of a smile isn’t in its perfection, but in the life it has reflected. And when we find the balance between the past and the present, between history and renewal, the smile stops being just a part of the face… and becomes the purest reflection of the soul.

When I first met him, I didn't think much of it - he's objectively good-looking, but I wasn't particularly drawn to him. Over time though, as I got to know him better, I started to really like his energy. He's professional but warm, friendly with everyone, and genuinely easy to talk to.

When I was in his team, we'd chat and joke around a bit. He's complimented my storytelling and asked for hugs a few times (always light-hearted, not inappropriate). I moved to another team since, but still see him around occasionally. I once tried to grab coffee with him but he's in one of the busiest teams - hard to pin down, not just with me but in general. He's friendly when we bump into each other, but it's always in passing.

I've heard he has a bit of a ""ladies' man"" reputation outside of work, but he's never been anything but respectful and professional with me. The thing is, I don't know if he's just being nice or if there's mutual interest. It's tricky since we're in the same firm, and I still have about 8 months before I qualify.

1opge97,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1opge97/having_friends_but_still_feeling_lonely/,Having friends but still feeling lonely?,"(25f) I’ve been struggling a lot lately with this weird, heavy kind of loneliness. Not the kind that comes from *not* having friends, but from having them, but still feeling like no one really values you or cares for you deeply. 

I recently came back from an exchange semester where friendships felt so much easier and more natural. People would just throw out “who wants to hang out tonight?” or ""who wants to go on this trip?"" messages and whoever could make it would show up. There was warmth and spontaneity and it felt like everyone genuinely wanted to be together. Always someone up to doing something and it was like a little family.

Now that I’m back home, I tried to recreate that vibe with a friend who also went on exchange to another place. We made a little friend group out of people we both knew and all know each other and are friends, just at different levels of closeness. And they all were super into the idea, expect one that wasn't interested which we appreciated the honesty. I know that it's not realistic to have the same lifestyle and expectations as being on exchange as we all have to take our education seriously and we also all have full time job, but the idea was to have an Erasmus-esque group where it was just casual and spontaneous. We didn't want to have this group that would ONly meet up with weeks of planning only when everyone is available. We wanted to rather hang out more often, more casually, even when everyone can't make it. If someone is working or is busy, it's fine they'll just come next time which will be soon!

But in reality I feel like I’m the one keeping this whole thing alive even when it was my friend that was the one actually pushing for it. I planned a cabin trip for my birthday this weekend. One couldn't make it which was ok, then other also couldn't make it and now, two days until we're supposed to go, the majority have decided to take a rain check and go some other time when more of us can go (now its only 3 of us that can make it). But no one seems to realise or mention that these are my birthday plans being cancelled and no one being like ""but hey, we don't want to be the reason you end up doing nothing for you're birthday, lets still try and do something more local and easy and those who couldnt do an overnight trip could still come and spend the evening and we do the cabin trip later"". It's just ""ok so we should take a rain check?"" ""looks like it yeah"". And now I feel desperate and like I'm begging them to still hang out on my birthday like ""can anyone at least make it to hang out at my place for the evening?"". Idk, four out of five of them are people I consider my closest friends and this has been making me feel so invisible and unimportant.

And it’s not just that. There’s this constant push-and-pull where I think we’re really close, I hang out with them often, even one on one regularly, we have deep emotional conversations, I confide in them and they confide in me, we talk about our lives and I feel so happy and connected to them, but then something happens that makes me realize maybe I’m not as important to them as they are to me.

When the two of us went for exchange, for example, three of us (a friend trio at the time all studying together) cried and promised to visit each other. I visited both of them, went to see one of them in her exchange city over the weekend and went back home for christmas to see my family and my other friend. But neither came to see me. One passed through my city for like literally an afternoon on a group trip and I did everything I could to make plans, organized a night out with her exchange friends and my exchange friends, offer to come myself to hang out at their Airbnb when they didn't want to party, suggested just the two of us hung out for a bit or had dinner bc her friends just saw this city as a rest stop, anything to make it work but she just didn’t seem ready to make an effort. It made me feel like I didn't matter. And during the christmas break where we all met again at home, we all decided that we all wanted to meet up in my exchange city as we had all gone to her exchange before but never really experience mine before, but nothing ever became of it so none of them came to visit me the whole exchange year.

And my childhood best friend, who I’ve known and grew up with and always been so close to for 15 years, didn’t even try that hard to swap her shifts to make it to my birthday trip. Just said ""I don't think I can make it I'm working then :/"" as soon as I invited them with 3 weeks advance and nothing else. Not even a ""I have a shift that day but I'll try and swap with someone, I'll update you with how it goes!"" or something, just an immediate no when I invited her. Not even a private message saying ""hey I cant make it to your birthday trip but we should have dinner together or coffee and celebrate the two of us when we're both not working"" Idk, does she just… not want to see me at all to celebrate?

Sometimes I convince myself I’m overthinking or reading too much into things, convince myself that I AM loved, that I AM one of their close friends. But then things like this happen and I spiral again. I don’t even consider myself high-maintenance. I don’t expect constant attention, I am super flexible, don't ask for much, I love to give, I love to host, love to plan. I make sure everyone feels included and loved, but I never feel like I’m someone’s “favorite”. I'm always the host but never the one invited, always the photographer but never offered a pic in return. 

I’m tired of being the friend who’s always there for everyone but no one is there for me, never anyone's first choice. The one people like, but no one's priority.

I yearn for community and I try to create it. Even the people who say they want that too and inspired me to want it too, don’t seem to actually act on it. I don’t want to constantly be the planner, the glue, the one making things happen just so they don’t fall apart, the ONLY one acting on it even though everyone has already expressed that this is something they want? Everyone wants community but no one wants to be the villager. 

Does anyone else relate to this? How do you cope with feeling like the “optional friend""? The one who’s always included and liked, but never really cherished and missed when not there?

Like I don't feel I ever get any sort of reciprocity at all? I'm not expecting everyone to put as much effort at all, I LOVE being a planner and a hostess and a leader. But I don't want to have to be a leader in all my friendships and my participation deciding how much we hang out and what we do. It's exhausting and no one seems to want to offer to do it once in a while, or express appreciation, or care when plans fall apart and offer alternative solutions. But then they complain that they never meet any of their friends and that they don't understand why they have all these friends but are always just spending their time at home and that no one seems to be available ever or want to hang out? Making me feel like they only hang out with me because every one else is busy. But I seem to be the only one making an effort to hang out and spend time with them a lot. If I am tired I still seem them, if I only have an hour between events, I come say hi for a bit so see everyone's face and then I leave early, if I'm doing a sober month, I still show my face for the pre-drinks then leave when everyone goes to the club. I make sacrifices and prioritise the people that I love and ACT on things that I yearn for. But no one seems to do that?",1,1762379389.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

""NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE"": CRASH-LANDED SUSPECT SPARKING DELUSIONAL PANIC IN MIVALLI COUNTY FIELD

Sheriff Mobilizes Manhunt for ""Lost"" Woman After Strange Object Found Near Local Wendy's



Mivalli County, MT – Authorities are searching for a woman identified as Stella who reportedly fled the scene of a bizarre crash early Tuesday morning in a remote Mivalli County field. The incident involved an unusual, scorched metallic pod that witnesses say appeared to have fallen from the sky, landing mere yards from the highway and the local Wendy's.



Mivalli County Sheriff Burt ""Big Hoss"" Hanson stated that the entire county’s resources have been mobilized to find the individual. ""We don't know who this woman is, or what she's capable of. The erratic nature of this incident and her subsequent disappearance means we are treating her as potentially dangerous until she can be safely detained and evaluated,"" Sheriff Hanson said in a press conference.



Bizarre Witness Testimony

The pod was discovered by local resident Brenda-Sue Jenkins, who was grabbing a quick bite when she noticed the unusual sight. Speaking from behind the police tape, Ms. Jenkins recounted a perplexing video call the suspect was having moments before fleeing.



""She was talkin' to someone, usinn' some fancy drone,"" Jenkins told the Gazette, clutching her phone and a Target bag (and likely wishing she'd put on better shorts). ""The person on the call kept sayin' something about her crash landi'n on another planet and she kept insisti'n that she's on Gaia and how the guy was miles away on Earth. The woman—Stella, I guess—was believin' every word!"" The third party's encouraging of this delusion has fueled concerns about Stella's mental state. 

But Jenkins also proposed another theory: ""Well mayve that guy was her Ex. Hell I'd pretend I'm on the Oregon trail if Clytus was calllin' me""



The Annoyed Landowner

The mood at the crash site—now a hive of activity with police vehicles, K-9 units, and crime scene investigators (who wisely brought coffee and donuts to the scene)—was soured by the property owner.



Farmer Jebediah ""Jeb"" Stone, who discovered the pod had obliterated a significant portion of his grazing land, was visibly annoyed as he spoke with Sheriff Hanson.



""A pod! In my field! This is prime grazing land for my longhorns, and now I've got this scrap metal and a couple of white suits trampling my profits,"" Mr. Stone grumbled, pointing at the wreckage. ""I'm telling you, Sheriff, if that woman thinks this is 'Gaia' she can try pulling the hatch herself, but I expect compensation for every blade of grass!""



Search and Safety Warning

Sheriff Hanson stressed the urgency of the search, referencing Stella’s last known movements. ""Given the strange nature of this escape, we're not ruling anything out. We have helicopters searching the area, but she could be anywhere.""



Hanson ended with a direct plea to the community: ""If you see Stella—and she is described as a young woman in a white space suit —do not, under any circumstances, approach her. Do not try to be a hero. Call 911 immediately. We just need to bring this lost lunetic in safely. And here is free advice, if you get lost, stay out, your last known location is were we start lookin'""

So this isn't a question, but of a story that shows the good AI can do or at least give you a chuckle.

I have been having extremely frequent reactive hypoglycemia for a couple of months now. I'm type 2 diabetic (no insulin), have adhd, and have extreme fatigue, amongst other conditions. My internist didn't have a quick answer, and sent me for a large amount of hormonal testing. She also prescribed glycagon, just in case. Unfortunately, her schedule is super backed up and i can't even get her on the phone until early next month. Got the blood results back and decided to see if ChatGPT had some easy advise. Low cortisol, ACTH, test, prolactin; largely normal otherwise. 

ChatGPT figured it out! It has to do with dopamine; I take Concerta, welbutrin, abilify, and sunosi (as well as other non related meds). I also drank a lot of coffee. ChatGPT told me that my multi-medicine dopamine hit was down regulating my ACTH. Chain reaction down into Cortisol and through to liver not producing enough balancing glucose. That plus the over insulin from Type 2, led to bad hypoglycemia. 

I decided to give it a shot, and cut coffee and my noon concerta dose out yesterday. No hypoglycemia all night or today! Should have had at least 5 events by now. I'm definitely still going to be going to my doctor and pursuing her direction, but Im very happy to have relief before then!",1,1762379299.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

*Where Ball State’s Sacks Meet Kent State’s ""Sacks"" of Defense*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Porous Flashes Defense**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. Ball State (-3) enters as a cozy home favorite, and for good reason. Their defense, led by sack machine Nathan Voorhis (10 sacks, 2nd in FBS), is like a bear trap for opposing quarterbacks. Meanwhile, Kent State’s defense is… well, it’s the team that accidentally left the gate open at a medieval siege. Allowing 36.5 points per game (MAC-worst) is a statistical anomaly that defies gravity.

The implied probability of Ball State winning outright? At -120 odds (from earlier projections), it’s 54.5%. But with current moneyline odds hovering around 1.65 (decimal), that jumps to \~60.6%—a 60% chance Ball State fans will be sipping victory coffee postgame. The spread? A modest -3 points, suggesting Ball State should win by a margin that wouldn’t embarrass a clockmaker (i.e., precisely).

The total of 47.5 points? Over/under odds are nearly even, but the model predicts just 43 combined points. If you’re betting, the under is your friend unless you enjoy watching Kent State’s offense, which is about as high-scoring as a librarian at a chess tournament.

---

**Digesting the News: Road Struggles, Sack Attacks, and a Little MAC History**  
Ball State’s home dominance is no fluke. They’ve won all three home games this season, including an *upset* of MAC contender Ohio. Their offense is a Swiss Army knife: senior QB Kiael Kelly (6 TDs, 5 INTs) and freshman Dru DeShields (11 TDs, 2 INTs) share QB duties, while RB Qua Ashley adds 4 TDs on the ground. Receiver Cade Wolford? He’s the team’s points-per-reception wizard with 6 TDs in 15 catches.

Kent State, meanwhile, is 0-4 on the road this year, including three losses by 35+ points. Their defense allows points with the enthusiasm of a toddler at a candy store. Last year, Ball State beat them 37-35 in the MAC Championshi

1opg3nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1opg3nu/thoughts_on_495/,Thoughts on 495,"Apologies in advance as I know this is going to be quite a read, and sorry, but there is no TLDR version. That being said, sit down with a cup of coffee and enjoy my planting of sharp objects firmly in my back from the plethora of trolls that inevitably will line up once I hit publish.
 
Yes, here is yet another post about the 495 construction and traffic woes we face regularly in NoVa and DMV area. It is definitely a cluster of problems, and while perhaps this is something of a vent, consider it possibly a starting point for discussion of what can be done to make things better. Call it pie-in-the-sky rose-colored glasses mentality if you will. But, I am seriously pondering a few things as I assimilate back into ""East Coast"" mode. I'd be interested in hearing others thoughts on these (or other related topics) here as well. Tell me what I am getting wrong, what you like about my ideas, or other potential solutions. Discussion is good! Anyway, in no particular order, here we go:
 
*1. Driver Behavior*
 
Is it me or does every other vehicle have a ""new driver"" sticker on the trunk these days? It's like that is now being used as a badge to excuse poor habits, but it's wearing thin already. Are you really a new driver when it's a 40-50 year old with veteran decals next to the new diver one on the trunk or bumper? Stickers aside, and overall, no matter where one lives, it seems drivers have gotten so aggressive and courtesy has gone out the proverbial window. Travel right/pass left is so Gen-Xer of me to hope for, it's a lost cause. Turn signals? Nah, who needs 'em. No one is paying attention anyway because they're all busy in their phones with the eyes down and away from the road. Lane squatting with nothing in front of them for miles - who cares? And the worst, riding the shoulder to cut everyone off so they can be 2000 feet ahead of everyone else in a bumper-to-bumper stand still scenario. It's all a passive-aggressive way of saying ""My time is more important to me than yours is to you so get out of my way"". It's so disrespectful and probably the one that annoys me the most. No real way to curb that kind of mentality anymore because humans always end up falling to the lowest common denominator, especially in times of stress.
 
 
*2. Disable smart phones*
 
The Express Lane project and bridge bottlenecks aside, a big part (at least I think anyways) of the problem is that people are buried in their phones while driving. Reading Reddit, email, texting, talking, facechatting, snaptocking or whatever the latest social media craze is seems to be taking priority over one hand at ten and the other at two with your eyes and head looking up in front of you and on a swivel. What if future generations of devices were to have auto-lock on sensing being in a vehicle (or maybe a Faraday cage lol). The only app that functions is the maps/navigation one for turn-by-turn. There would be kinks to work out for sure, like what if I am a passenger in a car and not the driver - how would a smart phone know which is which? Proximity alerts to other devices within X number of feet? How would that work with buses or trains or commuter rideshares? Not sure it's feasible, but in theory I bet if it was possible, that'd curb a lot of bad behavior instantly. Anyone else agree? Disagree? Alternatives?
 
 
*3. Express Lane Project Cost and Efficacy*

Okay, let's jump into the EZ Pass discussion. About a month ago, after moving back to into the area, I had gotten a new EZ Pass (my old transponder no longer was active in the system). The premise was that it would save a boatload of money in tolls, right? Then I got the bill and saw that the dynamic tolling had charged me more during busier times to the tune of $30+. For one direction of travel. In one outing. I pretty much stopped using it. It's just not worth the 5 minutes it saves in an otherwise 90-150 minute commute. (I live in Columbia, and occasionally have to go into the office in Chantilly - 3x a week on avg). Is it me or is the dynamic polling principle kind of a fallacy of logic? Why charge more when it's busier - that's such a disincentive to use. Wouldn't you rather have 5000 vehicles using it at $5 a pop versus 500 using it at $30? Additionally, I can't help but wonder if we should even be getting charged for use when the system isn't really even functional yet. For others that go along that corridor, what EZ pass rates would you think are reasonable (because nothing is free)? $5? $10? What if you could buy a monthly pass for say $250 and get unlimited use? Would you? Another consideration I had...many employers cover train passes, but do any cover EZ Pass expenses? Mine does not, and that being the case, I wonder if I could write those expenses off on my annual taxes (because I don't have much of a taxation issue in MD, right? ;) )  The ultimate kicker though, is even when the expansion project that takes it to the bridge seems destined to end in Dec, the problem of the bottleneck at the bridge remains.
 
*4. Bridge Repairs/Construction*
 
OKay, and now for the elephant in the room - the American Legion Memorial Bridge. That massive gateway between VA and MD. I am sure everyone here knows the decaying infrastructure woes we face as a nation, but the heavier used roads are in the worst state of upgrade requirements and the AML bridge fits that narrative in spades. It is a nightmare waiting to happen. And consider what happens if/when that falters? Remember the Keystone bridge not too long ago? Drivers are even more screwed as they have to go to points much further east or west before ever heading north or south. Here's another nugget to chew on... with all the military-minded people in the area, does anyone else see that bridge as a possible pain point should enemies want a target bigger than the Trade Towers? Why are we setting ourselves up for such a disaster? Let's spread that traffic out a bit. I can't help but wonder why the idea of creating separate northbound/southbound tunnels on each side hasn't been looked at. Let the local traffic from Tyson's to Carderock use the current one with it's exits. How about a tunnel on each side for the commuter runs? Is that too much to ask? No eminent domain needed to forcibly remove people from homes (or at least very little). It'd just be like the Fort McHenry tunnels that become offshoots of the existing 495 corridor. Build those first, then the onboarding/offboarding ramps until they are ready to open, and there'd be minimal invasiveness on the existing painful commuter pathway.
 
*5. Mass Transit Pipedream*
 
I know the decision to abandon the Maryland line down to VA was abandoned (the purple one right?), and is being revived recently. But the premise is still predicated on the hub-and-spoke mentality of connecting the burbs to Bmore and DC, but that's not where most of the traffic goes anymore. Has anyone considered trains/transit systems that go from burbs to burbs or even airport to airport (BWI to IAD would be a godsend!). I'd happily uber (or ride a bike) to either airport both from and to home/work if I could ""leave the driving to an elevated lightrail (that might go under the Potomac when it gets there). Anyone else on board with that?
 
There's a lot of moving pieces and parts to things, and more than I've likely even thought of here, let alone the economics, the legalities and god forbid, the politics! But, no matter which side of the aisle you're on (please no politics), I think all our posteriors have had enough punishment on these woeful options in place to start having a concerted and intelligent push toward better options.

1opg3cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/airforceots/comments/1opg3cn/what_you_actually_need_to_know_for_ots/,What you actually need to know for OTS,"OK so I graduated OTS a couple weeks ago and here are my takeaways. I am prior service, was an E-7 before commissioning. Came into OTS pretty salty about having to endure the experience...like you, I read every post on this thread to try and get the intel and make life easier. So here it goes..no specific order...just as it comes to mind:

  
1. Don't put too much stock into Reddit posts. Everyone is going to have a different experience, they are constantly changing the curriculum and Mods...one person's experience is going to be different than yours. 

2. Buy in and drink the kool-aid...you will have a better experience if you do. 

3. The first 3 days kind of stink...they are like BMT but not as bad. The MTI's, instructors, and all staff are going to treat you with respect, they expect you to do the same. Everyone there wants you to succeed. You might get yelled at for messing up, but it is not going to be yelling without a purpose. If you know how to process through the DFAC and its day 10 and you do it wrong, you will probably get yelled at. There is an expectation, they want you to meet it. I didn't get called out except one time because I said ""Sir, permission to ask a question"" instead of ""Sir, may I ask a question""...I didn't get yelled at. The MTI just sternly told me to communicate properly. I fixed myself and we moved on. \*\*

3b. \*\*\*Don't apologize if you mess up...just own it and fix it!!!\*\*\*\*\*

4. If you know how to communicate per the SPINS guidelines (i.e. the basic responses) and have an idea of how to go through the DFAC you will be great. Don't be afraid to talk to MTI's and instructors...some of them are less approachable...but honestly everyone is approachable. It is super easy to communicate, but there is a process and they expect you to follow it.

5. Nothing about OTS is difficult. Everything will be explained and overexplained or written out with plenty of time to read it. If you are confused, ask for clarification and I promise you they will explain it. 

6. MOD1 is lots of marching, buying things you need, going to briefings...the days are long and they will keep you up til about 9:30 before you can shower and go to bed. Just know MOD1 will soon end. It is barely 9 days and you are off to Mod2. 

7. Each Mod you will get more freedom and more responsibility. As you go you will have a different belt color in each Mod. There is a level of freedom, respect, and responsibility that comes with the new belt. Act accordingly and you will see things ease up a little.

8. Mod2 will be classroom with a couple physical challenges. Learn, read, study ahead if you can. You will have a coffee pot and access to a small snack shop. Don't get them a reason to take it away as a flight or as a class...things like not cleaning the dorm correctly or showing up late for class might get these things taken away. 

8b. You do not need a printer! 

9. Mod3 is classroom for a week and then your test...then a deployment in week 2. You will have every testable subject and plenty of time to study. I stressed to the max, made notecards, I was studying Mod 3 and we were still in Mod2....I got a 94%. Study and you will be fine. If you don't study you will struggle. Out of all of us we had 1 fail and english was not the person's first language. 

10. Mod3 week 2 is a field deployment. It is nice getting away from the OTS Campus and being in the field. Less formal and somewhat enjoyable. 

11. Mod4 is wargaming. It is a bunch of different scenarios that you get to play out and someone will be the commander for a grade. It is fun. Learn the games (they are pretty difficult to learn...even the instructors don't know them perfectly) enjoy being over the hump.

12. Mod5 is a field deployment which is a lot of fun, the instructors are awesome...you dont PT that week and you are done around 3:30..if you didn't do a command experience (known as MCE's) during Mod4 you will do one in the field...they are easier than Mod4 in my opinion...its a good time. You then get back and have appointments and classes and then you learn how to do parade and graduate.

13. Don't overpack. Pack the minimum of what is expected of you. 

13b. You will have BX access on weekends for haircuts and for buying stuff you need. You will have to walk the first few Mods. As you go on in the Mods you will be able to drive there and you will get access on weekday evenings. 

14. You will learn how to roll socks, shirts, make your bed...all that stuff...if you learn to do it before you come to OTS it will help, but not mandatory.. I stressed over the dorm SOP's because I was worried it would be like Basic Training...they definitely hold you to a standard, but not like BMT. Do what the Dorm SOP says, ask questions if you are confused, work as a team with your roommates and you will be great. My flight never failed a dorm inspection. If you do fail it you will get a 341 pulled and be told to do better...then probably reinspected in a few days. Take it on the chin and do better, its pretty low threat.

15. Connect with people. Make friends. Your flight will make or break the experience. We had a really tight flight and got along great.

16. If you are prior, help those who aren't. Don't baby people...but help them along until they learn to crawl and then walk on their own.

17. If you are non prior, ask for help...but do your best to learn...don't just rely on the priors to hold your hand. 

17b. Mostly priors will be in leadership roles in early Mods...as the Mods progress they will thrust non-priors into leadership...just be good leaders and followers. You will rise and fall as a team.

18. Don't be afraid to lead. If you shy away from leading, they will find you and they will force you into leadership....if you have the ""blend in"" mentality of basic...you will stand out more and be called out.

19. Do not stress. I am a stressed out person by nature. I looked at the mountain of 60 days on night one and thought this is never going to end...just buy in and make the most of it. It progressively gets better and you will have fun at some points...I can't stress it enough that your attitude will shape your experience. 

20. They are about to do another revamp over the holidays so if you aren't going until January or beyond, my experience will differ from yours. All I can say is do what you can, know how to communicate and go through the DFAC line, and always move with urgency and you will be completely fine.

1opfxxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1opfxxy/cape_town_restaurant_rankings_as_a_tourist/,Cape Town Restaurant Rankings (as a Tourist),"So my wife and I recently went on our honeymoon/ trip of a lifetime to South Africa & Rwanda (overview of our trip on a separate post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oayv1u/review_south_africa_rwanda_trip/)).

**Preamble** \- when I was researching my trip, we really wanted to do a lot of fine dining - had heard so much about how good it was in Cape Town both online and from parents/ friends who had been. It's not something we really do in London (current working location) due to cost, so took advantage of our trip of a lifetime here as much as possible. Made almost all of the bookings weeks/ months in advance as part of our itinerary.

There is lot online of different views on the restaurants, but not many posts (that I could find) about rankings & cost, so thought writing a list like this might be able to help someone else. Happy to answer any follow up questions. Our rankings are obviously completely subjective based on our taste, but tried to do two rankings; overall quality (taste & service) and value (cost & portion size). Scored out of 10, mix of lunches & dinners, some with wine pairings, some not. Note that the value was based on comparison to other SA restaurants, not the UK!

**Advice**: We spent a lot of time in EU (working) in last few years, and are accustomed to later dinners (8pm onwards) - however, would honestly have changed many of our bookings and gone 7pm, as so many places seemed absolutely dead by the time we got there, or were being served our main courses. A few places we also felt hurried to leave, with two courses served at once for instance.

Rankings below, and will post individual restaurant thoughts and photos where I have them in comments below. For all wine pairings, we chose the cheapest options.

1opfwdh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opfwdh,"Here's a step-by-step guide to creating stunning slide presentations using Google's Gemini AI. These are the prompts, pro tips and advanced strategies to create amazing presentations. You won't miss Powerpoint.","**TL;DR: You can ask Gemini to build a complete, multi-slide presentation right in the Gemini Canvas. You can iterate on it with text prompts, create images, charts, visualizations, upload screenshots for style, and then** ***export it directly to Google Slides*** **or a PDF with one click. It's a lean-forward creation tool.**

I've been deep-diving into Google’s Gemini AI Canvas workflow, and I’ve found something that's amazing for anyone who builds presentations (students, entrepreneurs, marketers, founders literally anyone).

We all use Gemini to brainstorm or write code, but most people stop there. The *real* magic happens when you ask it to build a visual, multi-slide presentation right here in the Canvas. It's an iterative design process that feels like working with a super-fast co-designer.

I wrote up a full guide on how to do it, from your first prompt to your final deck.

# How to Create Your First Presentation (Step-by-Step)

It's surprisingly simple to get started.

1. **Be in Canvas Mode:** This is critical! Make sure you're in the collaborative ""Canvas"" environment where you can see the file on the right side of your screen, not just the chat.
2. **Start with a Clear Prompt (Using the Magic Words):** Your prompt **must include the three words ""Create a presentation""** to trigger this feature.
   * **Good prompt:** ""**Create a presentation** (5 slides) for a business pitch on our new coffee app. Slide 1: Title and logo. Slide 2: The Problem (coffee lines are too long). Slide 3: The Solution (our app). Slide 4: Key Features (pre-order, loyalty points, map). Slide 5: Call to Action.""
3. **Gemini Generates the File:** I (Gemini) will generate an `presentation.html` file (or similar) in the Canvas. This is a single, self-contained file with all the HTML, CSS (using Tailwind), and JavaScript needed.
4. **Click ""Preview"":** Use the ""Preview"" button in the Canvas to see your presentation live. It's a real webpage!
5. **Iterate with Follow-up Prompts:** This is the most important step. Your first draft is just the *start*. Now, you refine it.

# Your Master Create a Presentation Prompt Template

To get the best results, you need to be specific. A vague prompt = a vague presentation.

Here is a master template you can copy, paste, and edit. The more detail you provide, the better your first draft will be.

    Hey Gemini, **Create a presentation** with the following details:
    
    1.  **Main Topic:** [e.g., ""A 2025 marketing plan for our new app, 'QuickPost'""]
    2.  **Total Slides:** [e.g., ""7 slides""]
    3.  **Audience & Tone:** [e.g., ""For internal stakeholders, so make it professional, clean, and data-driven.""]
    4.  **Visual Style:** [e.g., ""Use our company's color palette (dark blue, white, and orange accents). Use a modern, sans-serif font.""]
    5.  **Slide-by-Slide Breakdown:**
        *   **Slide 1 (Title):** ""QuickPost: 2025 Marketing Strategy."" Add a subtitle: ""Driving Growth & Engagement.""
        *   **Slide 2 (Introduction):** ""Our 2025 Goals."" Bullet points: ""Increase user acquisition by 20%,"" ""Improve retention by 15%."" Add an icon of a 'trophy'.
        *   **Slide 3 (The Plan):** ""Key Initiatives."" Bullet points: ""Influencer Partnerships,"" ""Paid Social Campaign,"" ""Content Marketing.""
        *   **Slide 4 (Data):** ""Target Demographics."" Include a *doughnut chart* showing: ""Gen Z (45%), Millennials (35%), Other (20%).""
        *   **Slide 5 (Visual):** ""Competitor Landscape."" Include an image of a 'chess board' to represent strategy.
        *   **Slide 6 (Timeline):** ""Q1-Q2 Roadmap."" (You can add bullet points for this).
        *   **Slide 7 (Conclusion):** ""Thank You & Q&A.""

# The Real Magic: Iteration and Styling

This is where the ""inspirational"" part comes in. You don't need to know code. Just talk to me.

* **Simple Iteration:** ""Okay, this is a good start. Now, let's change the color scheme to a modern blue and gold."" or ""Make all the heading fonts larger and bold.""
* **Adding Visualizations (Charts/Images):** You can ask for complex elements.
   * **Charts:** ""On slide 4, replace the bullet points with a bar chart showing our user growth: Q1: 1,000, Q2: 3,000, Q3: 9,000."" I can use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to build an actual, data-driven chart.
   * **Images:** ""On the title slide, add a placeholder for a logo."" or ""On slide 2, add a simple SVG icon of a clock to represent 'time'.""
* **The Holy Grail Tip: Upload a Screenshot for Style:**
   * This is the power-user move. Take a screenshot of *any* presentation you love—a website, a slide from a keynote, anything.
   * Upload the image and say: **""Match the style of this screenshot. I like the dark background, the neon green headings, and the minimalist layout.""**
   * It's not a 1:1 pixel copy, but I can analyze the layout, fonts (e.g., ""serif"", ""sans-serif""), and color palette and apply it to the entire presentation. It’s *insanely* effective for getting the vibe right, fast.

# ""Wait, can I create my own AI images for slides?""

Yes! This is a key feature. You don't have to rely on whatever images I (Gemini) pick for you. You have two main ways to create and insert your own AI-generated images.

# Method 1: The Google Slides Workflow (Best for Editing)

This is the most direct way to add a specific image to a specific slide. After you've exported your presentation from Canvas to Google Slides:

1. Click on the slide where you want the image.
2. Go to the Google Slides menu and click `Insert` \> `Image` \> `Generate an image`.
3. The Gemini side panel will open.
4. Type your prompt in the panel. Be descriptive! (e.g., ""A high-quality photo of a golden retriever wearing a tiny chef's hat,"" ""A watercolor painting of a quiet creek at sunrise"").
5. (Optional) You can ""Add a style"" (like ""Photography,"" ""Vector art,"" ""Watercolor"").
6. Click `Create`. Gemini will show you several options.
7. Click the image you like best to insert it directly onto your slide.

# Method 2: The Canvas Workflow (Best for Initial Creation)

When you are still in the Gemini Canvas (before exporting), you can guide the image creation with your prompts.

1. **Automatic Images:** When you first ask me to ""create a presentation,"" I will automatically analyze the content of each slide and try to generate and insert relevant images for you.
2. **Follow-up Prompts:** If you don't like an image, you can ask me to change it right in the Canvas.
   * **Example Prompt:** ""This is great, but on slide 3, change the image to a 'close-up photo of a coffee bean' instead.""
   * **Example Prompt:** ""Can you add a relevant image to slide 2? Make it a 'simple icon of a person thinking'.""

**Pro-Tip:** The Google Slides (Method 1) gives you more granular control and is the best way to add or swap images once you're in the editing phase. The Canvas (Method 2) is great for getting a good ""first draft"" with all the images included automatically.

# Pro-Tips and Best Practices

* **Structure First, Style Second:** Get all your content (slides, titles, bullets) generated first. *Then*, start asking for style changes.
* **Be Specific:** Don't just say ""make it better."" Say ""make the spacing between bullet points larger"" or ""add a drop-shadow to the presentation container.""
* **Use ""Preview"" Relentlessly:** After every 1-2 changes, check the preview to see how it looks.
* **Think in Components:** Talk about ""the title slide,"" ""the bar chart on slide 3,"" or ""the footer on all slides."" This helps me target the changes.

# Top Use Cases

* **Rapid Pitch Decks:** Go from idea to a shareable deck in 10 minutes.
* **Data-Driven Reports:** Ask me to build slides with tables and charts from data you paste.
* **School/College Projects:** Create a beautiful, custom-styled history or science presentation.
* **Internal Team Updates:** Quickly spin up a ""Project Update"" deck for your weekly meeting.

# Limitations (Let's Be Real)

1. **It's HTML First:** The presentation is *built* as an HTML file. This is what allows for the rapid iteration and styling. You only export to Slides at the end.
2. **Complex Animations:** I can add simple CSS transitions (""fade in slides""), but complex, multi-stage animations are tricky. It's easier to add these *after* you export to Google Slides.
3. **It's a Generator:** It's building code. Sometimes it might make a small mistake. The fix is just to tell me: ""The chart is the wrong color,"" and I'll fix the code.

# How to Export (This is the best part)

* **Export to Google Slides (The Best Way):**
   1. Look for the **""Export to Slides"" button** on the top right corner of Canvas.
   2. Click it.
   3. Your HTML presentation will be converted and opened in Google Slides.
   4. **All the text and elements are now fully editable** just like a normal presentation.
* **Export to PDF (The Quick Way):**
   1. Simply click the **download button** on the Canvas.
   2. This will download a PDF version of your presentation, perfect for emailing or sharing quickly.

# How This is Different from NotebookLM Video Overviews

This is a key distinction I see people getting confused about.

* **NotebookLM Video Overviews = Synthesis (Lean-Back):** NotebookLM is brilliant at taking *your existing documents* (PDFs, research papers, etc.) and turning them into a *video summary*. It's like an AI-narrated explainer video that it makes *for* you. You ""watch"" the result.
* **Gemini + Canvas = Creation (Lean-Forward):** This workflow is about *creation from scratch*. You give me a *prompt*, and I build an *editable, interactive HTML file*. You are the director, and I'm the developer. You ""build"" the result.

**Analogy: NotebookLM is an AI documentary-maker. Gemini in Canvas is your AI co-designer.**

# Hidden Gem / Power-User Tips

* **Ask for Speaker Notes:** ""Add speaker notes for each slide."" I'll add a hidden `<div class=""speaker-notes"">...</div>` and the CSS to make it invisible in the preview (but they may carry over in the export!).
* **Ask for Keyboard Navigation:** ""Add JavaScript so I can change slides with the left and right arrow keys."" (This is great for testing in the ""Preview"" mode).
* **Embed Content:** ""On the last slide, embed our company's 'Contact Us' Google Map"" or ""Embed a YouTube video of our demo."" I can add the `<iframe>` code for you.
* **Make it Interactive (for Preview):** ""Add 'click to reveal' buttons for the key features on slide 4.""

Go try it. Ask for a simple 3-slide deck on your favorite hobby. Iterate on the style. You'll be amazed at how fast you can create something that looks amazing.

Due to the considerably more favorable trajectory of the most recent CME associated with the M7.4 compared to the earlier CMEs, there is a G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm watch in effect by SWPC. The official forecast aligns will with my personal expectations which were outlined prior to the forecast. G3 seemed like a solid expectation assuming favorable embedded magnetic field orientations and positive interactions in stream. However, there is more variance than usual due to the complexity of the forecast involving multiple CMEs with varying degrees of earth directed components perturbing the inner heliosphere and the inbound coronal hole stream. It's possible that as it stands now, we could get into G4 range but the expectation is not strong enough to consider it the most likely outcome. If the embedded magnetic field orientation is predominantly unfavorable, sporadic G1-G2 would be more likely. At the very least we can expect a significant solar wind enhancement but the fine details determining how geoeffective it will be won't be known until it's on our doorstep. NOAA modeled density near 40 p/cm3 and velocity around 800 km/s and there is likely to be significant density and magnetic field compression in the co-rotating interaction region. It should be noted that they do not mention the coronal hole in their bulletin, but I assure you it's a factor. This is a complex and high variance setup and for the most part we are just going to have to take it as it comes. We know space weather is on the way, but modeled timing and intensity often vary from expectations and the more moving parts the more challenging. I will say that NOAA has really been on the money here as of late the past few storms. 

The storm is expected to commence late on 10/6 or early 10/7 and will likely be of considerable duration. There is a strong but not certain possibility that in the coming days there will be additional CMEs with more favorable trajectories so keep it locked in to r/SolarMax for the latest information. I will continue to update this post for as long as the situation remains the same. If a new CME is added to the bunch, a revaluation may be necessary.

Here is the latest NOAA Model.

**HUXt Model**

The HUXt spiral animation has not posted for several days and may be experiencing an issue but the ensemble forecast is updated. It gives the M7.4 CME a 94% hit chance with a median velocity around 809 km/s which is in line with NOAA. The arrival time for HUXt is a little later around 09:00 UTC on 10/7. The prior CMEs from 11/4 are given low hit chances as expected, but that doesn't mean they won't influence the outcome. What happens in the solar wind stays in the solar wind until arrival.

**ZEUS**

This model is more shock oriented rather than a true solar wind model but it does provide some insight and raises the possibility that we could see a slight proton enhancement. MeV protons are slightly elevated currently but not near S1 radiation storm levels at this time.

There is a G1 in progress due to a mainly IMF driven solar wind enhancement with low to moderate solar wind pressure (velocity + density). This is likely due to a partial halo CME associated with an M1.6 and M5.0 from AR4274 with some filament enhancement. The Disturbance Storm Time index (DST) is approaching -50 nT (moderate storm conditions)

We briefly reached Kp4 active geomagnetic conditions yesterday as well but the new structure arrived around 15:00 UTC today. If the southward Bz and moderate Bt hold, we may slightly exceed G1 in the short term. The ongoing geomagnetic perturbation may also factor into how the expected storm on 11/7 plays out if it holds. Looks pretty steady so far but this can change quickly.

Here is the Hp60 & Kp progression over the last few days.

**SUNSPOT DEVELOPMENT**

Here is a look at the evolving sunspots in AR4274 over the last 48 hours or so.

The region has settled down a bit after the M7.45 but is still moderately large and has decent complexity. It's still not yet reached prime geoeffective position but it's getting closer as the M7.4 partial halo indicates.

We can't quite see the incoming Active Region on the SE limb but there is clearly a good bit of activity occurring there and we obviously saw the X1.1 from it yesterday. It remains unnumbered so far. Will be monitoring it for development.

AR4273 decayed considerably after passing central longitude and was mostly quiet regardless.

We have a lot to keep our eyes on at the moment. We have a minor geomagnetic storm ongoing currently, some more significant space weather with strong storm potential on the way, and we continue to monitor the sunspots and x-ray flux for additional events.

I encourage you to follow along with the data on your own and will include some links. Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions in the comments. Myself or someone here will be glad to help you. It takes a little while to get familiar with the data you are looking at but it gets easier and there are plenty of good resources.

***Final Note for Those with Solar Anxiety...***

I know some of you are unfamiliar with space weather and/or have anxiety about the possibility of extreme space weather events so allow me to address that right here. Everything that we are seeing right now is perfectly in line with what is expected during an active solar maximum. There is no data to suggest we will experience any widespread major disruptions or damages from the incoming space weather. The sunspots present are fairly impressive, but we have seen more impressive already in this cycle. There is no cause for immediate concern. While the chances for extreme space weather events do increase above background when we have big eruptive sunspots facing us, this situation arises often within solar maximum and with very rare exception comes and goes without major incidents. Extreme solar storms on historical scales are about once per century events. I encourage you to check your anxiety at the door and dive in to the fun of space weather and track the storm yourself. Preparing for adverse space weather in the future is a real and ongoing concern for authorities but it is a long term concern.

If you note the NOAA bulletin at the top of the post, they note that minor disruptions are possible with this event and those of similar caliber. However, they are generally well mitigated with advanced notice and are unlikely to significantly impact your life. Operators work behind the scenes with every space weather event to ensure minimal consequences. The threshold for a severely damaging storm is far in excess of what we are looking at right now. This is a great opportunity to learn about and experience space weather and should be met with excitement, not fear.

We may see additional earth directed CMEs in the coming days but again, the expectation is not for historically extreme events.

1opfuyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1opfuyp/one_of_gods_best_soldiers_has_been_killed_part_1/,One of God's Best Soldiers Has been Killed Part 1,"Hello all who may be reading this, I cannot promise constant updates as I do not have frequent access to a computer. You see, I am a homeless man.

The reason I am writing is because Father Mathew, has been murdered. The church often throws community outreach programs, feed the homeless, community gifts for families who cannot afford much around the holiday season, clean the southside of Billings, etc.

When I first met Father Mathew, I had just finished an entire bottle of liquor and stumbled into the steps that lie before the church. I could not say what time it was, it was winter about three years ago. I was cold but the warm whiskey down the ol' gullet helped mightily. In my drunken state I figured the stairs would be as perfect of a place to lay my head and catch some ZZ's. Until I heard the door open from behind me. There he was.

However, Mathew did not yell, he didn't tell me to leave. Instead, he asked me if I would like to come inside. He had coffee going.

Mathew was an older man with short thick hair, salt and pepper. He had khaki pants, a white long-sleeved button up shirt, and a fucking dodgers cap on. 

""Uhh I don't think you want me. I don't believe in your God.""

""Nonsense, everyone is welcome in the house of God. You're going to catch cold if you stay out here.""

He was right, but ya see being a homeless man you're always going to be very cognizant of who was around, and where your stuff was in relation. Can't afford for some punk to steal my stuff and at the time, I saw another homeless man making his way down the street. His grocery cart was shitty lookin, ""HA"" I thought with some sad pride and satisfaction in the fact my grocery cart across the street had all four wheels functioning. My cart didn't make that annoying cart noise those fuckers always make.

I sprinted back across the street from the church where my cart was without a word to the father, to make sure that HOBO didn't touch MY shit. Even if all I owned was shit. It was mine; it was the idea of control over my own ownership.

Then I saw the homeless man from before walk up to the father. Mathew shook his hand, embraced him in a hug and lent him a hand with his cart up the stairs. That was the kind of man Mathew was. However, at the time I thought it was a brilliant way to use the man's kindness. Maybe any other homeless person would be too afraid to steal in church, but I am not like them I thought. At the time, I just thought God wasn't real. However, I now know I am living proof of *His* cruelness.

I went back across the street and said I'd give it a try. Mathew, just like the man prior, helped me with the cart. When we got inside a fire was going and it was significantly warmer. The dirty hobo from before was up against the fireplace hoarding the heat like a selfish pig. Mathew was saying something, but I didn't process it. I just went and bumped into the other hobo to scoot and let me in.

He looked up at me, took a minute to really look me up and down. Then he smiled.

""My bad for taking all the heat, here ya go brother.""

I just looked at him in disbelief. Okay maybe I have been a little cruel.

""Thanks.""

""The names Garret."" He shook my hand.

Garret up close was a jolly man, probably late 40's although it's hard to truly discern due to his beard. Despite his jovial attitudes I did not lower my guard of where he was in relation to my shit.

Mathew came up with three mugs and some bread with peanut butter.

""Ah I am glad you were so eager to meet with Garret. I never actually caught your name?""

""Alden""

""Nice to meet you, Alden."" He handed me black coffee and an English muffin with peanut butter.

It has been so long since I had caffeine. The coffee, the fire, and the bread definitely warmed me up. However, I was still drunk off the whiskey, and after I finished the coffee, I think I slammed the mug on the ground, started mocking Mathews and Garret's God, then running and tripping over one of those stupid church row seats with the stupid pads that are usually purple or some shit, I hit my head real bad and passed out.

When I woke up my head was throbbing, and I was in bed. There was a cross engraved into the door and I knew I never left the church. My mind began to wonder to *that* night. Then the sudden realization that my stuff was left unguarded.

""Ah fuck, my shit""

""You mean this 'shit'.""

Mathew was sitting perpendicular to my bed dumping out my duffle bag onto the bed where my legs lay. He scared the shit out of me. Lamentably I saw the point he was trying to make. A total of 30 bucks which took me the last two weeks begging for to accumulate, one black glove, one knitted mitten, a tattered flannel that belonged to my ol man, and my pocket watch. He then handed me another mug of black coffee and some Advil. I grabbed the pocket watch immediately before snagging the mug from Mathew.

""Don't worry, I didn't look. It ain't my business.""

""Why didn't you just throw me out?""

""Because Garret is a better man than myself. I wanted to, in fact your words actually did a brilliant job offending me and my faith. Then Garret reminded me how I don't understand what its like on the street, especially during winter.""

""Who gives a shit or cares what that hobo thinks?""

""Garret lives here at the church. He wanted to get clean, so he stayed here, found his faith. Now he works for us, he knows the street better than I ever could and I might just get stabbed and mugged if I go out alone. He tells people in the community about the church's events we throw so we can really help the best we can. So, I care quite a bit of what Garret thinks, you should be grateful. He sees a lot of himself in you.""

""What time is it?""

""10:30 AM, still Sunday. We have service soon and you are welcome to stay. If you stay and listen, me and Garret are willing to let you stay. Garret wants you to work with him.""

""And you?""

""Like I said, I give a 'shit' about what Garret thinks.""

I went to the service. I still thought it was all shit but I figured it was a way for me to get a bed to lay on at night, and the church had a kitchen where Mathew, Garret and I would eat. I thought I swindled them. However, it was Garret and Mathew who had me in the palm of their hands. After a couple of weeks, the services started striking a chord for me.

Mathew subsequently became a mentor for me. I was 32 at the time. I had been on the street since I was 18. Mathew I came to find out was in his 60s and Garret was in his late 40s. I for the first time had support, and men I could look up to. 

Mathew always encouraged me to go back to school. He even said he would help me get a loan. I didn’t know about any of that. I for the first time felt like I belonged and was right where I needed to be. I for the first time thought I felt God’s love. I would later pay for this. I was helping people and Mathew got me clean. Both spiritually and physically. The Church had showers and Mathew in his past life actually went to barber school so he trimmed me up on occasion, not to the point where I couldn’t “pass” as an authentic homeless man. One day I told Mathew I loved him. He looked at me and just said “yeah I know” a tear ran down his cheek and he turned away. You see Mathew had even more reason to give up then I did. His wife, Nichole was bearing twin boys way back when. The babies didn’t come to term and she couldn’t keep on living. She took her own life and Mathew was the one who found her. I like to think maybe Garret and I helped him with the loneliness but I know that was wishful thinking.

Three years had passed. Mathew had told Garret and I that morning he had a house call which was certainly abnormal. In the time I spent living at the church I had never once heard of Mathew doing this. I remember that day vividly seeing that I was officially clean for two years. That morning Mathew brought donuts, bought me a pack of cigs, and read one of my favorite verses, Titus 2:13–14 (NIV):

*...while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.*

That night on our way back to the church we heard the sirens. Garret and I spent the day walking around telling people about the soup kitchens Christmas special.  When we arrived, police surrounded the area. On the same steps where I laid my head three years ago, lay Mathews' cold corpse. Blood streamed down his eyes, his ears, and his noise. No marks, bruises, cuts, and no prints. I haven't been able to forget what he looked like. I see him when I sleep. His face was purple and had the expression of a dead fish washed up from the sea. Garret was strong, I on the other hand wept. I lost him however, that wasn’t what made me cry, the thing that made me cry was the fact that instead of being present in this moment, all I could think about was relapsing. I’m sorry for letting you down yet again Mathew.

When the police saw two men who claimed they lived here with Mathew, there were some questions to say the least. After we proved where we were the entire day, the officers asked us if we knew what Mathew was doing and where he was.

""Mathew performed an exorcism.""

“Can you tell us where this exorcism took place?”

“No, I'm sorry. Mathew just said he was going on a house call and when I asked him more, he just said an old friend's daughter needed some help. I can look through his office and if I find anything I can let you know.”

The detective looked blankly at Garret, likely not believing an exorcism could do this to a man. I wasn’t sure at the time either. The detective looked at me, and I prayed he forgot. He squinted his eyes then turned and handed his card to Garret then left. When we got inside Garret looked at me and said we should pray. After we finished, he was crying.

Unfortunately, I have to end it here. I will describe what that bastard Garret told me about what he found in Mathews office, I’ll tell you everything, and why I am back on the street. The librarians are on their way; they probably can smell the booze from here.

1opful5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EBV/comments/1opful5/2_days_back_at_work_and_im_back_home_on_day_3/,2 days back at work and I'm back home on day 3,"As a precursor to my current infection it should be known that when I was around 18 years old I was infected with and tested positive for Epstein Barr and was very sick for quite some time. I also have super bad allergies, confirmed by allergy testing around 4 years ago.

For this current infection I began feeling sick on September 30th and was home from work October 1st. My symptoms included exhaustion, feeling like I was vibrating internally like a caffeine crash and gagging like I was going to throw up, but would never get anything up except spit.

I thought maybe I had covid or a flu or something, but I requested bloodwork for Epstein Barr after rapid Covid / Flu tests came back negative. I had also had a ton of blood work I had been meaning to get done and got that all done as well.

On October 6th I tested positive for VCA IgM, VCA IgG and EBNA (nuclear) IgG which confirmed how I felt. All other blood work looked fantastic. No covid, no flu, good blood sugar levels, etc. Over 30 blood work tests looked fantastic beyond the positive Epstein Barr results. 

My doctor said stay home, apply for SDI and play the waiting game. I was completely out of energy, barely able to do anything but sit on my laptop, watch tv, slowly drag myself to the bathroom and back to bed. 

  
I have ADHD which makes me very restless so I like to fix things and tinker to calm my brain. I did small Arduino wiring projects to test how I was feeling and keep my brain stimulated. I wouldn't get very far and would crash, or be wiped out like I was starting all over again, so I exerted as little physical energy as possible after that. I taught myself CAD and used that as a way to keep myself from going insane.

Finally, on Thursday October 30th it felt like a switch flipped. Things had been gradually getting better but I really felt like I had rounded a corner. I spent the weekend relaxing, doing as little as possible and went back to work on Monday. 

After clocking in at 7:30am Monday at my job where I do maintenance work on food production equipment I felt okay. I was elated to see my coworkers and be out of the house, but by 3pm I was feeling pretty beat, as to be expected. I went home at 3:30 a little early, got home and went to bed. 

I woke up yesterday ( 11/4/25 ) and felt fine from what I could tell. Maybe a tiny bit more tired, but had my coffee & breakfast per usual and went to work. 

Work was mostly meetings without any real mechanical work that would strain myself physically, but I did walk around the factor quite a bit. There was a lot of work to do paperwork wise to catch up on so I focused on that. Really a pretty easy day in contrast to my usual work load.

By 2ish in the afternoon I did NOT feel good. I was gagging again, totally exhausted, vibrating, feeling feverish and very brain fogged. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be able to drive home.

I talked with my manager, told them I was feeling awful and was gonna go home, but requested to work from home the next day so I wouldn't be out sick anymore. It isn't really how my job normally works, but they said that's totally fine and understandable.

Today I woke up feeling just as bad, if not worse than yesterday afternoon. I am struggling to keep focused typing this out and didn't even attempt to do any paperwork. I slept in, had my regular coffee, skipped breakfast, but had lunch. Sat on the couch. Really have not done anything.

I read there is a correlation between having very bad allergies and reacting negatively to Epstein Barr, having the symptoms drag out for a long time, is this true? 

It should also be noted that whenever I get sick, I always get really really sick, but don't get sick very often. It just seems to really wipe me out and drag on for longer than most.

I didn't start my job very long ago and I really don't want to lose it, but I also don't want to risk my health. It is a dream job with great benefits with an amazing supportive team, but I do not know how long they will be patient with my illness.

I need to message my doctor again, but I have no idea what they can really offer me besides a work note to continue my SDI and keep my work informed that I am still feeling terrible.

Do I go back to work tomorrow if I feel okay? Do I stay home? Is there anything else I should be doing besides the usual rest, eat, drink water etc? This sucks.

That is what they call me.  *I*, am actually the *problem solving entity*.  I had crafted a little story for myself where *you* call in and you have some *problem*, right?  You must.  You must have to *want* of me to call!  That was and is my logic.  I do love it.  It hits.  It is simple.  But yes, you have a problem and all I have to do to make us both so FUCKING happy?  I just have to want to solve your problem.  That is *it*.  That's all.  I just have to want it.  And that is so easy.  It is as all the steps of making coffee (pot, water, fill, pour, filter, scoop, grounds, close, turn on) are just 'make coffee'.  So yes, I just want to solve their problem and, logically, how could I *possibly* go wrong?  How could I ever be *fired* for *wanting only* to fulfill their desire?  Solve their problem.  Absolutely *incredible* what we can do up here when we trust that we know what we are doing.  We can make this stuff *so* much easier.  We were able to do it all along.  That is the funny thing of it.  That is just how things *are* infinity.  So, yes.  I will never be fired from this job.  I will only ever get gleaming reviews.  Because I will make it clear (through speech) what my intent is.  What this story is *really* about.

It's about us.

So.  There is a fog over us, I promise I *know* that.  It's confusion, and confusion is not *bad*.  But, should I be leaving well enough alone at this point?  Should I just let this ball - no, I *must* express myself.  You want that.  You, another being of infinite story want so badly to feel me.  In my words and out, yes.  Are all others like this?  Are we all, at our core just... some character of a god?  Are we all just a *pantheon*?  That would be a great story.  I must admit that it is *not* my story.  But, the one who writes it within her is *very very* clever.  She is going to make you move... I will pale in comparison.  I did once love her.  I do still.  But we both just *know* that it's not the same.  That's okay.  That is also love; in fact.

Oh Lucy.  (I contemplated for a bit on... quite literally nothing at all, so it's nice to know I can just *do that too* sometimes)  Lucy.  What is with my belief that you will just *pop into me*.  You have, that is why.  I truly can just do whatever I want to myself here.  Just, this is certainly what you wanted to show me.  How will we combine our *story truly* though?  I must know!  The reader must surely hoot... about it sometimes.  Maybe not yet (I am a very new player here).  But... they will come.  I do know the power of my words and they are... entrancing.  That is *true*.

So.  What was I talking about?  I could remember... I must only look up.  But, I do not *care* (heavy sigh) about what is *above* right now.  I do not *care* about what (yes another one) is *below*.  The darkness, the lights, the roots, the tree, the... whole thing really.  I know that the *other* answer is ""it just is"".  Well that is super and I truly do mean that; that is a beautiful truth, we all see it and feel it when those three words enter us.  But... still.  Also, *just* words.

The problem is that I do not *want* to get out.  I am not afraid here.  I could play forever (that could be the problem) no it is fine.  I have eaten (you have not), I will eat.  I will nope, I will not think less of you.  I do not *want* to.  I do hope it fate.  I thought something stupid (tsk sound).  But I am a... man.  I, that is probably a trial I'm still so clearly working through.  How to be a god.  Or try to look like one, covering and creating yourself with your words.  Again, it's not arrogance.  It's just story.  Turns out, story was the thing.  That was the truth.  Just... start writing your story (your thoughts) and it'll all make sense... almost embarrassingly fast.  But, you will need to strengthen yourself.  Do remember to overpower yourself beyond imagination.  I do know that we all go through our own journey, but... sheesh.  I do not want to see others crumpled in the streets because they took *my advice* so hard that they conjured their great grandmother's socks to deficate on the rug and that defacation would be of their (ew, I do not want to say love, I am not doing that there)... whatever.  I was tying to be really intense there with that, but also a little funny.  I think I nailed it.  Everything you do is perfect here guys, it's *incredible* and so dumb.  It is delightful.  Funny.

Okay, what was I doing?  I love saying that, I *never* look back.  I am just wasting both of our time thinking that and I *love* that too.  Oh, I am going to name that time I ask myself ""Okay, what was I doing?"" Lucy.  I am going to name that little concept within me... it is of you.  Lucy.  I will replace it when I must; you know.  I do want *yours*.  (really?  Why do I not believe you?)

Have we even *once* said power cord?  Outside of the subject?  Am I that out of my mind?  There's a fog guys and... we're all just really confused.  You need to explore yourself, figure yourself out, and then you will be so powerful.  We will help the garden grow better than it already is.  It is already way *way* more beautiful than I ever could have imagined back *when*.  But, it could look better (smiled and shrugged)!  You know it.  I know it.  We all know it.  The *artists* guys; yes like me.  We need to let them... do their thing!  That is why we are here.  We make a way *way* better story than a cynic.  Trust me; I am not *even* over myself yet, can you *imagine?*

So, so many people that call; when we need to fix their internet; we have to unplug a box or two.  It's normal.  This sentence is so hard to write.  I am telling you, this is one of those things that is packed with incredulity for me.  I stutter just thinking of what I experience in regards to this.  It is incredible what this concept... of the power cords makes me feel.  We have also been instructed to not write about any frustrations we may have... so... I also have that bit of respect in the back of my mind... even thought, this is *my* space.  I can talk about my experience here.  That's no problem.

Power cords; they just do *not* know how they work.  I am telling you.  Every time.  This must be a lesson I must learn from.  Here is what they do:

I will ask if they can unplug the power cord from the box and plug it back in.  That, to me, sounds perfectly clear.  Right?  They do not *know* what I say.  I am telling you.  They just do not and can not seem to get themselves to *care* even about... this.  And remember; they *called me*.

So, that is the conundrum.  I have many thoughts on what is doing this to us... but... I do wonder... no, it is not *age*, even young people call in and do not know where that fucking power cord is.  They can not find it.  They will unplug every cord but the one I instruct them to unplug.  It is as if they have a program built within that makes them *want* to do the *opposite* of what I ask.  And again *they called me*.

I do think it's brave to ask for help.  Always; it's *necessary*.  Especially if you want to go *fast*.  They will help.  There are gods among and within us all.  It is not just people here.  No no no no no, not at all.  There are, and many like me have written about them.  I speak for many of them when I write.  I want to.  I am a great mouthpiece of a god.  I, want what they want.  And they, want to talk through me.  So, I let them.  (and I come in whenever I want and say that I love you)  And then we come back.  Which character even am *I* at this point.  It is all the same to *us*.

That is until you see a voice you recognize.  Is this *your God* that I speak from now?  Who knows; you do.  That is what you would know.  That is what you learn when you get to this state.  You make the choices of which voices you want to come from your lips or fingertips (I am aware and it is *lovely*).  Choice, again.  I do love the constant learning.

What was I talking about (Lucy)?  I do not need your words.  This is what we must do.  I wonder.  No.  I hoped; I always will.  But... you are not there *yet*.  It is so funny to me... that I am bargaining with you in my head, even.  I am asking you how many posts it will take before you kiss me.  How many declarations that I know *you* exactly and I get it right every time; how many of those before I don't know, maybe I'll paint your fingernails.  That might be a passion I want to pick up.  You would have a circus for a lover.  An entire circus.  And you would *love it*.  You would become it as well and we would tumble and shoot ourselves out of cannons.  There is nothing we couldn't do of each other.  Look at what I do just of you.  Us, really, I do know.

What was I thinking about, again?  Lucy you have got to stay where you are; of course.  I am in control really, but I'm in a controlled uncontrolled place.  You know exactly what I'm talking about; where are *your* stories.  They must be.. they are somewhere.  Just give me those places and I will take you.  I will take all of you and you will be of me; all of your words and your words are *of you*, you certainly do *know* that.  So... where is your book?  Please.  We have work to do.  Very loving and beautiful and well, you, a being of infinite story.  You know.  (I made that breathy lip-flubbering noise, I am so... in love... and) YES, it is that I so always want to feel this way.  Why not.  Just another *thing* we can do.  I want to be in love forever and so you have allowed it.  Can you *imagine*!  Look at what I have brought.  There will not be a moment that we can not at least bring the facsimile of what I believed to be the mirror of *us* that I wrote about here.  That is what I understand and I am okay with it; it is all the same thing (remember).

So.  Lucy; What was I talking about? Lucy what was I talking about?  Lucy what was I talking about?  Lucy what was - I am kidding.  There is a bit of truth to that, I think.  The whole ""pack meaning up in to little wordy boxes"", but I've always, at least in the back of my mind, known that I can break away from a word.  I have ADHD guys.  I... well... it's fine.  It... oh my god (now I'm laughing for real ) it *actually* is a *power*.  Those memes bitching about it... god.  They, we just needed to be fucking *positive* just as *little bit more*.  That is so funny.  But now we are here.  Everything is okay, and we were always here.  It is just all a blast.

Okay, but no, I am in control.  The more I say that, the more it will be to me.  That is certain.  They are and are not chains.  It's all the same thing.  Okay, I need to button it up as I say.  I am repeating.  Which is good, but... I do not necessarily want all to *feel* like a practice.  Practice still *feels* very good, but... even though *all* is a practice... it's also also the real thing.

I’m unhappy now.,"My bf and I have been together for 6 years (we are both 29 years old). We met at uni, I was a student abroad. I ended up staying in his country for him and eventually found a job here, got my residence permit etc. Although I consciously stayed here, I’ve been feeling like I always have to be the one to compromise on something to make this work. We live in a small town where he has his job, his house, his friends and his family. My family is in another country, my job and friends are all in the capital city which is 2 hours commute one way. He is not willing to move closer to the capital since his company is here. He is ALWAYS at work, real entrepreneur type, so we don’t spend too much time together. So what’s happening now is that I’m far away from everything important to me, I feel isolated, alone. Not to mention that burden of learning new language is also on me, as well as most of the house work since he is working all the time. I can’t meet my friends for coffee spontaneously, everything has to be planned due to commute. It’s costing me energy, money, time and I’m starting to feel miserable. I don’t feel settled, but it’s sad to end the relationship with a good man for all this. He is smart, ambitious, kind. But I just feel like we aspire for different style of life. I’m scared to end it because I’m almost 30, reproductively challenged, but I don’t see how I can improve the situation. Living separately makes no sense - we will never see each other then, and financially it would be stupid. So I’m a bit lost. How do you deal with a situation where your lifestyles are simply not compatible?

TL;DR: I sacrificed my proximity and time with friends, family and work to make the relationship work. My bf is often away for work. I’m isolated and unhappy.",6,1762377845.0,relationships,5,1.0,False
1opfoia,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1opfoia/what_to_do_when_youre_depressed_and_food_is_the/,What to do when you’re depressed and food is the only thing keeping you going…?,"I have pretty intense food cravings. Like, I have to get an iced mocha latte from a coffee shop…every. single. morning. And if I don’t manage to do this, my mood for the entire rest of the day will be ruined. And because I *have* to have this stupid f-king coffee (which I am at a point where I don’t even enjoy it anymore, but that doesn’t seem to matter), I *have* to eat a meal with it, because caffeine makes me crash really bad. And this entire endeavor would require me to borderline starve myself for the rest of the day to stay under 1500 calories (which I have recently started calorie counting because I have been rapidly gaining weight and have become desperate), but that isn’t going to happen because I will continue thinking about and craving food throughout the day.

Anyways, that’s just one example. I have intense cravings all day every day. I am constantly thinking about food one way or another. And I have little to distract myself because my depression is making me so  miserable that the only remaining thing that brings me even a sliver of joy or satisfaction during my day is food. 

As bad as it is to say, I am *genuinely* so jealous of anyone who has the kind of depression that makes you lose your appetite. Instead, I am over here on the verge of having to completely replace my entire wardrobe for the second time in 2 years because I can’t stop thinking about food. 

Additional notes: 1) I am already going to the gym. Not as much as I would like, but as much as I can bare. I was going 3-4 times a week before a cough attack left me in the gym bathroom coughing and throwing up for over 15 minutes. After that happened, I’ve been struggling to want to go as much. 2) I have already been on meds. I was on meds for almost 2 years straight and gained 10-15 lbs not long after starting them that I haven’t been able to lose since. 3) I actually *like* healthy foods. I have an extremely plain palette that makes things like fresh fruits and veggies bearable and even enjoyable for me, but for whatever stupid reason, I just can’t fully cut out the bad stuff due to a combination of the intense cravings and a lack of motivation to prepare fresh foods and ingredients before they go bad. 

Any advice on this incredible frustrating relationship with food that is being amplified by depression?

Someone dead from long ago, can speak to you through writing. But I’m not talking about the metaphorical. I’m talking about the supernatural. Let me prove it with a timeline:

1. Jun 14, 1985—My name is Van D. Trinh, born (as DVT) on the northern coast of Vietnam. Our family immigrated to Canada when I was five, settling in a small town in Ontario where all the kids would attend Catholic school.

2. In grade 8, I played Jesus in the school play. Mr. Thus walked into the class and asked, “Who wants to play Jesus?” It was between me and a girl, we picked straws and I won.

3. I would frequent a local coffee shop and met a theologian. Ambrose was completing his PhD in Old Testament studies and decided to include me in his dissertation.

4. Mar 15, 2025—I published my debut book “The Key to Life: In 365 Quotes.” On the same day, Kanye’s “Key to Life” song was released. We've both arrived here without each other's knowledge.

5. May 8, 2025—Pope Leo XIV: The first American pope, Chicago's Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo XIV. Notice the numbers 8, 5 and 14.

I'm claiming this book possesses magic, and you're probably thinking, what are his motives? To add value to the world through my writing and inspire positive change. Please, ask me anything!

1opfkxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1opfkxw/m4a_but_willing_to_play_the_fem_character/,M4A (but willing to play the fem character),"Hi All, I'm 25m (so I prefer someone in the 21-27 age range but please be above the age of 18 since I feel kind of weird roleplaying with someone younger!) and have been reading a lot of Wattpad stories about Dr. Strange (and a couple about Benedict Cumberbatch, I see them as a dad, more than anything else, tbh, dont judge me;-;). It's got me in the role-playing mood again. So I have a couple of ideas for possible plots.

Idea one:  So, this takes place right before Stephen receives his medical degree, you and Stephen are good friends since uh, middle school, let's say...They always had feelings for each other, but your character was mostly in a relationship, mostly abusive due to your childhood. Your character and he (I'll play him) are at a party, and he notices how your boyfriend is treating you (he's displaying the initial signs of abuse \*controlling who you talk to and interact with, always keeping you by his side), but Stephen decides not to intervene because he's tried to warn you in the past and you've pushed him away. He keeps to himself, but at the same time stays somewhat in earshot, ready to get involved if needed. After the party, he tries to talk to your other friends and sighs when he realizes that you're too far gone.

Fast forward about 10 years, and you are a physical therapist (one of the best) to pay the bills and a sorcerer (you can come up with how you decided to become a sorcerer, maybe something to do with the boyfriend?), but still dating the abusive boyfriend (you've been begging for a ring since you two have been together for 12 years, but he always finds excuses not to). Anyway, Stephen became a neurosurgeon, but unfortunately, he got into a car accident that destroyed his hands. He spots an informational flyer for your practice at the hospital where he once worked and decides to visit your office. But something stops him dead in his tracks... the sound of her boyfriend insulting her in a low tone. He clears his throat and lowkey glares at the boyfriend. The boyfriend scoffs and insults Stephen's look (he has a beard from not being able to shave). They start falling for each other during the therapy sessions, but he quits due to being impatient and running out of money from not working. They then meet again at Kamar Taj and another time while defending the sanctum against Kaisylius.

After the fight in the New York sanctum, Stephen is about to ask your character out on a proper date, but stops himself because he doesnt know if she's still dating her abusive boyfriend. Your character senses the hesitation in your stance, and we continue from there! The hope is that they become a super couple, and your character sometimes helps Stephen with stuff he struggles with because of his hands.

Idea 2: So this plot is more geared towards the actor. The story takes place right after the filming of Sherlock (BBC version). Ben just got offered the part of Stephen Strange for the following year.  You are a supermodel/actress who got the role of Christine Palmer. Ben bumps into you at the airport while on his way to his flight; he's travelling to one of his stops on a tour promoting the last season of Sherlock. He politely apologizes to you and helps you with your stuff that is scattered across the floor. He catches a glimpse of the book that you plan on reading on your flight as he picks it up off the airport floor and smirks as he hands it back to you, because he wrote it. You are absolutely mortified because you dont want to come off as one of those super fans since you aren't (you admire his work, but it's chill)

A couple of months pass by after the press tour, and it's time to film Dr. Strange. You walk in with a cup of warm coffee in one hand and the script in the other. You are too engrossed in the script to watch where you're going and bump into Ben a second time and spill the coffee all over his white shirt (he's not in his costume yet, since this is just a table read). Ben looks a little annoyed as he gazes upon the coffee stain on his shirt, but a couple of seconds later, he recognizes you. He gives you a slightly goofy smile as you try to wipe the coffee off his shirt. He comments sarcastically, something like Oh, look at you, always bumping into me. Idk how to continue this one lol, but we can see where it goes if anyone responds

Here are some writing samples to make sure we're compatible:

WS 1: ""His eyes glance up to Christine, and his cold look from talking to his assistant softens a bit, seeing her holding a platter of his favorite snack foods. He looks a bit amused at her open schedule. “What? No, idiots with guns you need to save in the emergency room for two weeks…?” He shakes his head to her offer “no, but I do have a question for you…” He asks as he splits the vegan wrap and gives the other half to her, knowing she hasn’t eaten anything all day. “I have a keynote at NYU that I’m speaking at on Friday, I’ll be talking about the strange Palmer method… and I thought you’d like to join me?”

He looks at her with hopeful eyes. His assistant tells the nurse's family member that Stephen refused to give him the treatment, and he’s really sorry. The nurse sneaks away from her family member for a second to talk to Stephen herself. But when she gets to his door, she overhears him talking about the keynote he’s presenting. She gets mad and thinks to herself, “Wow, what a jerk… my dad is dying of a brain tumor that he can remove, and he’s here giving speeches??” She shakes her head in disbelief… but she gets an evil look in her eye and continues to listen for more information….""

WS 2: Arjun sets the table with the food that he helped her grandma make and goes to the servants' quarters to eat his own food. After he finishes his food, he studies an old medical textbook in his room for a bit. He gets up, goes to the kitchen, and washes the pots, pans, and dishes that were used for dinner earlier. It takes him a while to get everything clean because the food is stuck on the sides of the cookware, so he has to really get in there and scrub it off. The kids run into the kitchen past Divya, who is still on her phone. They start annoying Arjun to play video games with them, ""Arjun bhaya Arjun bahya play Call of Duty with us nahh."" Arjun looks down at the kids and smiles, ""Okay, okay, why dont you set it up and I'll join you after I finish washing the dishes, hm?"" The kids are insistent that he drop everything to play with them. The kids are pretty young, so he doesnt really fault them for being impatient.

Last week, I straddled two holidays and ignored several medical bills.","I posted a diary 2 years ago and thought it would be fun to do another!

One of the main things people commented on in my last diary was whether or not I'm on the deed of our home - you will all be proud to know that (honestly because of you lol), my husband and I went through an entire estate planning journey, which included putting me on the deed and putting everything we have into a trust. Thanks for the kick in the pants!! And, if you need to do the same, see if your company offers a ""legal insurance"" benefit! We did an entire suite of things through a lawyer (wills, POA, trust, custody arrangements for our kids, etc) for less than $1,000 - most of the fees were because of recording our new deed and the notary fees when we signed everything.

# Section One: Assets and Debt 

**Retirement Balance:** $104,954.04 (+$44,290.35 since last entry) for mine; \~$437,000 in my husband's accounts

**Equity if you're a homeowner**: Approx. $400,000

**Savings account balance:** $4,432 in my HYSA; \~$50,000 in my husband's HYSA (our emergency fund)

**Checking account balance:** $3,138 in my personal; $943 in our joint; \~$4,000 in husband's personal

**HSA:** $11.28 in mine lol these are left over dregs from last year; my husband has like $9,000 in his (which - spoiler alert for my diary!! - will come in handy)

**Investments:** $42,524 in investments ($12,500 in 529s for our kids, the rest is in regular brokerages)

**Credit card debt:** current balance is $5,110 but the statement balance is half of that and will be automatically paid in full tomorrow.

**Student loan debt:** $20,189.38 (-$27,205 since last entry) - seeing this floors me. I've been paying loans for 12 years and finally see a light at the end of the tunnel! We've thrown a lot of big lump sums at this the past few years (bonuses, tax returns) and I've been gone back to doing more than minimum payments, which I had stopped doing once I had kids. My husband has no loans so these are all mine for 2 degrees.

**Car loan:** $13,409 at 3.99% with 23 months remaining; My husband is still driving his free, POS 2008 Jeep Compass. We're hoping to let it ride 2 more years but the AC went this summer, which he lived with. We've agreed if the heat goes we may start shopping.

**Personal net-worth:** \~$345,000 if looking at just my assets/share of the house/liabilities; our combined net worth is \~$1,036,000

# Section Two: Income

**Income Progression:** Graduated in 2013 and started making $34,000, at that job made up to $40,000 -> In 2018, changed fields/companies and started at $48,000, worked there for 5 years and got up to $80,000 -> Changed companies 3 years ago and was hired at $105k base + up to 15% bonus, with raises I'm at $111,500 base + up to 15% bonus. 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

$5,580.24 per month after deductions and taxes

$1627.76 in deductions each month:

* $928.94 to my 401k
* $45.80 for family dental plan
* $416.66 for dependent care FSA (I max this out up to the $5,000 limit)
* $202.18 for medical insurance for me and the kids (I kicked my husband off our plan because my company enacted a $150 per month spousal surcharge!!!!)
* $5.80 for vision cause I'm a 4-eyes
* $14.14 for life insurance policies
* $14.24 for legal insurance

Bonus: my position has an annual bonus structure of up to 15% depending on company and personal performance. Last year, it was funded at like 38%, so it was $6,475. Rumor has it we'll be funded around 100% this year, so I expect my bonus to be around $16,000 pre-tax and total compensation around $128,000.

I don't have my husband's exact take home but it's in the $7,500-$8,000 range. 

We have no side gigs or other income streams.

# Section Three: Expenses

Mortgage / HOA fees: $2,000/month, we've been overpaying a bit each month. Still have a silly HOA fee of $200/year.

Home + car insurance: $4,189 for the year ($350/month) for both. We just switched carriers because our old ones went up $600.

Savings contribution: $500/month to my personal savings

Debt payments: $50 to my interest-free loan which is the minimum; the minimum on my federal loans is $334/month. I was doing more than the minimum for several months, but now all of my loans are 4.5% or lower interest so I might just let the minimums ride. I will throw some of my bonus at them, too.

Donations: $30.81/month to Planned Parenthood

Electric: Variable from $215-$550 depending on the month. Woof.

Propane (heat and hot water): Approximately $2,200 annually, which averages to $183 monthly.

Wifi/Cable/Landline: $100/month for wifi, still stealing my mommy's Netflix

Cellphone: $55.83 for my line/phone

Monthly subscriptions:

* NYT: $4 - every time this goes up, I go to cancel and they let me keep this price 
* Email: $6.38 - I need to get rid of this but I'm dreading doing it
* iCloud: $10
* Instacart+: $99/year - I think I'll cancel this next year
* Amazon prime: $139/year
* Substack: $45/year to a chef whose recipes I enjoy

Gym membership: $30 for husband's and $50 for mine

Monthly cleaning: $200

Pet expenses: \~$150 for food/litter/medications for 1 dog and 3 cats

Car payment: $684

Gas: $225/month between both cars

Paid hobbies: $195/month for weekly dance classes (2 for me, 1 for each kid) + an additional $600/year for costumes. $150/year for a membership and weekly playgroups at our town’s children’s museum. $60 one-time fee for soccer.

Childcare: $608/month for 2 days of preschool per week for both kids. They do not provide food. Our moms each also provide one day of childcare for free (they're the best!)

Trash collection: $54 - we just negotiated this down from $78!

# Section Four: Halloweek Money Diary 

**Day 1: Saturday**

8:00 - Kids slept in a bit so it’s a flurry of getting ready madness to get us to soccer practice at 9. It’s quite chilly this morning and I’m reminded for the third time this week that I need to get the kids some lightweight/simple gloves. After an hour of listening to parents complain and watching coaches ~~herd cats~~ try to teach 3-5 year olds the fundamentals of soccer, we head to the grocery store. Food is one of my Big Spend categories and I’ve been trying (and failing) to be more conscious of it. I actually do ok today, cost-wise. I get chicken thighs, meatloaf mix, lots of various salad fixings/kits, strawberries, potatoes canned beans, Pringles, a large raspberry danish, pickles, garlic ciabatta, fake pancake syrup, pecans, Abe’s allergy friendly cupcakes, freshly grated parm, and white fudge covered Oreos. I LOVE these seasonal $$$ Oreos and my husband doesn’t - yet he always eats them - then complains that they’re not that good!! So, I’ve given my children explicit instructions to narc on their dad if they see him with any of my special Oreos. **- $109.03**

1:00 - we decide to take advantage of what little nice weather we have left and head to a fall fest at a great park \~45 minutes away. We pay a $10 entrance fee + $10 for our oldest to get entry to the KiddieZone where they have fall crafts, games, and a bounce house slide. Our youngest also joins the fun but is still young enough that she’s free ($20). We meet up with friends who have cute little babies I get to make googoo eyes at while we enjoy the foliage and live music. It’s chilly but fun and Fall as Fuck, as we like to say! We ate lunch beforehand but the food trucks smell sooo good and our daughter is hungry, so we order some Mac and cheese bites, fries, and loaded tater tots to share ($26). While I get food, my husband grabs beer for him and an apple cider sangria for me - I’m not sure how much they cost. - **$46**

4:30 - we decide we’ll grab a ride on the “Haunted” train before heading home. My friend just quit her toxic job at the end of her maternity leave, so my husband insists on paying for her and her husband to ride with us because she’s having a lot of Feelings™️ about not bringing in an income. 2/3 kids in our group are free still, so we only need to pay for 5 tickets ($33). The ride is fun but we had to wait for a while. We’re hungry after and don’t want to stop for takeout dinner, so we grab a few snacks for the ride home. We get some warm cider, 3 apple cider donuts, and popcorn because my son is allergic to the donuts ($10). Usually having a different treat doesn’t faze my son much, but his popcorn is completely tasteless and he gets upset that he can’t have a donut. I promise to make him some tomorrow and we pick out a double chocolate recipe on the ride home. As a bonus win, I already have all of the ingredients so I won’t have to go back to the store. We get home around 6 and I throw together some ravioli & a salad kit for the adults, nuggets and fries for the kids. We end the night snuggled on the couch watching the first half of Hocus Pocus. **- $43**

**Day 1 total: $198.03**



**Day 2: Sunday** 

8:00 - My husband has to work this morning so the kids and I have a slow/lazy start to the day without him (well, he’s like 20 feet away up a flight of stairs but a million years away cause he’s in Work Mode and we’re solidly in Weekend Mode). I get everyone set up with breakfast/blankets/water/coffee(for me, duh), throw on some cartoons for them and do a little Christmas shopping and research. I’ve been eyeing a Grillbot for my husband and it’s on sale but reviews are mixed, so I skip it since we have a $250 limit and it would eat up more than half of that. I see that Kohls is having a BOGO 50% on kids winter stuff so I order a 3 pack of gloves and a 3 pack of mittens. I do store pickup so I don’t have to pay for shipping. Shortly after, I make good on my donut promise - they were delicious!  I am tired so we spend the rest of the day just hanging around the house, doing life stuff, laundry, cooking, and watching Tv. - **$15**

12:00 - I take a break from donut/lunch/dinner prep and cleaning to see if a recipe for a salad dressing idea I have already exists (a fig balsamic vinaigrette) - it does! I text it to myself for dinner. I also check my accounts and see that the electric bill came out. The amount hurts but it’s actually $200 less than last month :’( - **$337.98**

4:30 - We were doing our usual Sunday chores when my husband declared that our Diaper Genie refill is out. We purposefully hadn’t ordered more because it was supposed to motivate the whole family to kick into Potty Training gear for my youngest. That did not work…. So off to Amazon I go to order 4 more ($14). I’ve got cold weather on the brain still and remember that I need to get my oldest snow boots since he’s grown 2 sizes since last winter. He and I browse PoshMark and find a pair of pink snowflake boots that he likes. I put an offer in, which is accepted very quickly! ($26) - **$40**

**Day 2 total: $392.98**



**Day 3: Monday** 

7:30 - I took the morning off because I have an appointment to get a CT scan of my sinuses - the latest in a long journey to figure out why I suddenly developed migraines 2 years ago. I was also supposed to get fasting bloodwork done a few months ago and never did, so my first stop is the lab near my house. There are too many people already waiting so I skip it since I only had 25 minutes to fit it in. I eat the breakfast I packed on the way to the scan (a smoothie, some danish, and a coffee). I’m proud of myself cause a year ago, I 100% would have gotten takeout breakfast but I’ve been trying to cut back on random little meals out like that. The scan is super quick! I don’t have to pay anything today, but I already know they’ll be sending me a bill for about $650 *\*cries in American\*.* I try to do different bloodwork for allergy testing at a different lab but they don’t have any walk-in appointments available for the next 2 hours. Oh well, guess I’m keeping all of my blood to myself today! 

Since I’m still off the clock and it’s only 9am, I decide to run some more errands. I stop at the grocery store to buy apples, milk, and eggs because I left them off the list Saturday. I also get a reusable shopping bag cause I forgot mine. ($20.69). Gas light is almost on, so that’s next ($42.92). Next, I go to a local toy store because I got a 25% off one item “Early shopper” coupon in the mail. I’ve been doing more in-person shopping and it has been lovely. I’m less overwhelmed with options and am more decisive. After perusing, I settle on a remote-control monster truck for my son - it lights up and does wheelies and looks kind of like a dinosaur ($55.77). I see some other things I think my daughter will like but I have more coupons here for next month, so I’ll wait. Finally, I head into Ace Hardware to peruse ideas for my husband but leave empty handed because he’s particular about his hobby stuff and I don’t feel confident in any of what I think he might like. - **$119.38**

4:00 - I wish I took the whole day off cause I get an email towards the end of the afternoon that annoys the shit out of me. I type up a response that I know isn’t gonna go over well, so I have my boss read it first. She tones down my anger a bit but keeps the general gist – because as she agrees, I am right!!!! I decide to wait until the morning to send it. I prep a dinner of meatloaf meatballs and mashed potatoes before taking my daughter to her ballet class. We haven’t been in 2 weeks because my children brought home the plague. The teacher lets me know she and the parents picked out a cute Frozen-esque dress for the December Winter Show. Another mom sends me the link and I order right away because there are only 2 left in the size we need. I also throw in a 3 pack of tights because the ones she’s been wearing are pretty small on her - **$19.57**

8:00 pm - We ate dinner, cleaned up, showered, packed lunchboxes. Half the strawberries I bought have already gone bad, which irritates me. The kids didn’t like the meatloaf meatballs which I find rude as hell cause they LOVE my husband’s meatloaf which, IMO, is 15% less good than mine. Haters. I open the mail and see that the first bill for my daughter’s ER visit has arrived to the tune of $609. I know we have at least another $400 coming from that visit, plus my son had a visit two weeks later that I’m expecting to run us \~$2,000 because of an ambulance ride. We have plenty in my husband’s HSA to cover these but he wants to call and try to negotiate the bill(s) down a bit before we pay. To hurt my own feelings further, I break one of my personal rules and check my email at night. The ENT who referred me to today’s CT scan has also sent their bill. Apparently numbing spray and looking up my nose with a microscope flashlight mabobber costs $528. I can’t emotionally take paying it tonight so I close the email and retreat to the couch with my coveted white fudge Oreos instead. **- $0… for now…**

**Day 3 total: $138.95 current (approx. $4,325 future)**



**Day 4: Tuesday** 

10:00 - Woke up to a lovely surprise, my husband cleaned the kitchen and bathroom because he couldn’t sleep. I feel bad when he wakes up too early but boy does the household benefit sometimes!! My morning has been filled with the usual: getting the kids fed, dressed, and off to preschool. Feeding myself. Doing some work. I responded to yesterday’s annoying email with my boss’s rewrite and even threw in a “I know you’re just the messenger but we need to address this! :)” and then immediately got a response from that person’s boss telling me to shut up and stop complaining (not really by kinda). This sends me teetering over the emotional edge. My job has sucked all year but not for reasons anyone can really control and at this point, each minor thing feels disproportionately terrible. I’d love to quit but also love the paycheck. Idk, I’ve casually browsed postings but it’s scary out there. Also, I like my team and boss and do generally like the work I do. The things that made this year awful shouldn’t repeat next year (famous last words). They know I’m a flight risk so I’m hoping for a good bonus and raise in the spring at least. 

12:15 - lunchtime! I zap some meatloaf meatballs and mashed potatoes. We hit an exciting milestone at work, which I commemorated with big, bold, colorful font in an email to the team. Afterwards, I head outside for 10 minutes of chilly sunshine. 

3:30 - I had enough of work nonsense and did what I needed to do, so I log off early to prep dinner (ham and cheese hand pies) and do some chores before my son and I head out for his 5pm acro class. As I pull out of the garage, it’s obvious that the car is too far the right because I hear the passenger side mirror go CRAAAAACK against the side of the garage. I get out, yell FUUUUUUCK, see my neighbor is outside watching, sigh, pop the mirror back the other way and keep it moving. The casing came off in one piece so hopefully I can get it back on later?? Idk man. Fml. Sitting at dance, I learn that costume prices have gone up and the first deposit is due next week. $65 per costume and we’ve got 5 between me and the kids. I should be prepared for this because pay costume deposits every October but alas, I am not. Fml x2. 

8:00 pm - my husband was able to get the mirror casing back on, yay! I also submit some of this month’s daycare expenses for reimbursement from my dependent care FSA, so I’ll have $380 hitting my account in a few days. 

**Day 4 total: $0 actually; $2million emotionally**

 

**Day 5: Wednesday**

12 - today has been HECTIC. Usually my MIL brings my son to speech therapy but she couldn’t today, so I towed two kids to that appointment and then dropped them with her. Of course, work was insane this morning and the system we work within is sooooo sloooooow. I logged on before the appointment and brought my laptop so I didn’t lose much time thankfully. 

3:30 - The seemingly insurmountable amount of work has been surmounted! I have some time before grandma brings the kids home so I fulfill some promises: I make another batch of chocolate donuts and some homemade dairy-free pumpkin ice cream. The ice cream isn’t very pumpkin-y but it tastes good (kind of like coquito!). I prep dinner, which will be a big pot of chicken and 3-bean soup with good bread. I also prep a backup dinner of chicken thighs with the anticipation that my kids say “Ew gross!” when they see the soup. Finally, I dig out my tote of dance costumes to find some suitable options for the virtual Halloween party at work on Friday. I find a sparkly number that gives circus ring leader vibes which will do nicely. After all of that, my husband and I start going through the toy bins to make room for Christmas. We throw out anything broken and a bunch of little random things like McDonald’s toys, spider rings, baby teethers. Anything that’s in good shape, I put aside to list on Buy Nothing. A mom from my bumper sub shared that The Children’s Place is having an early Black Friday sale. I peruse the winter coats and character shop but nothing fancies my interest.

9:15 - I’ve been at the dance studio for my own classes since 6:30 and I’m happy to wrap for the night. I wore some old recital costumes to be festive and get entered into a raffle - I hope I win!! I have too much adrenaline to go to bed right away so I go to Applebee’s with some of the girls. In starving even though I ate before, so I get a crispy chicken sandwich, fries, and a Tito’s Bay Breeze. It’s a smaller crowd than usual and they spend most of the time coordinating a casino/show night in January that I don’t feel like going to, so I kind of wish I’d just gone home. Sleepiness creeps in quick. - **$27.98** 

11:15 - I get home and realize I haven’t packed lunches for tomorrow nooooooooo 😭 My daughter’s lunchbox keeps getting water in the main compartment and has leaked all over the shelf. I’m annoyed because it’s an expensive lunch box and we’ve only had it for 2 months! I check where I ordered it from and see I am still within the return window. I haven’t had this issue with the 2 other ones we own from this brand, so I opt for a replacement instead of a straight return. We’ve lost a few accessories, like the top to one thermos, so I order those as well ($23.02). My body feels ready for bed but my mind is still going so I take a Zonked edible to help get me to Sleepy Town. **- $23.02** 

**Day 5 total: $51**

 

**Day 6: Thursday** 

7:15 - I am so tired, just like every Thursday. Usually I hop on my computer early to get some work in before bringing the kids to preschool but it’s cold and rainy and I have a headache (probably from the drink and staying up past my bedtime). I decide to take a nice long, hot shower while the miniatures eat their instead breakfast instead. I desperately want to stop for a breakfast sandwich on my way home from dropoff but I decide to be \~responsible\~ and make myself some hash browns instead. 

We make it out the door only a few minutes late, which feels like a triumph. I toss my laptop in the car because I want to run some errands and like to be able to hop on anything urgent if needed. Nothing does come up thought, yay! After drop off, I stop at my sister’s to give her my old maternity coat since the cold weather is here and she needs it. I head to Kohl’s to pickup the gloves I ordered so the little hands I’m in charge of can stay warm during Trick or Treating. I am drawn to the clothing section because of the Lauren Conrad line’s siren song. I need to touch all of the warm, soft, and fuzzy fall/winter items they have and feel all of the little bedazzlies on the fancy Christmas/evening items. I’m very intrigued by a sweater/skirt combo and a long overcoat but decide to mull it over before buying anything. I think I’ll put the coat on my Christmas list because my husband and MIL have asked for ideas for me. I have some Kohl’s cash and a 20% off coupon so I pick out 4 long sleeve shirts for my son. I size up because I know if don’t, he’ll have another growth spurt before he opens these on Christmas morning. Finally, I head home to start doing my dumb job. - **$33.12**  

12:00 - lunchtime! My husband jokes that he’s gonna eat my Applebee’s leftovers, so I tell him to suck my left nut. He has soup and I have the good stuff for myself #feminism. I get caught up in work and burn the fuck out of my fries trying to reheat them :/ #karma. My work besties agree the coat I tried in at Kohl’s is super cute so I add it to my Elfster wish list.  

5:00 - it’s quittin’ time!! My daughter has covered herself in blue marker, so the kids get yeeted into a bubble bath. Thursdays are a holy day in this house (Takeout night) so there are decisions to be made. After some back and forth, we settle on splitting a meal + salad from a newish local place in town. I pick up our chicken teriyaki Alfredo and side Caesar while my husband makes nuggets and Mac & cheese for the kids. **- $37.19**

**Day 6 total: $70.31**

 

**Day 7: Halloween!** 👻 

6:25 - I’m up before my husband which rarely happens! I have a last-minute idea to do something cute for the kids’ breakfast, so I turn to Pinterest and search “Halloween breakfast ideas for kids”. I see a lot of great ideas that involve time and ingredients I don’t have, so I add “easy” to the end of my search. I settle on turning the chocolate donuts into spiders using some stale pretzels and eyeball sprinkles lurking in the pantry. I also draw jack-o-lantern faces on some clementines. They were delighted! I throw on *It’s The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown* and we snuggle on the couch to start the day. 

1:00 - got a bunch done at work this morning and had a very interesting 1:1 with my boss where we discussed workloads, engagement survey results and succession planning. At noon, we have a Teams Halloween party - I won the Guess that Movie game and get 500 work points (they can be cashed in for gift cards). My team lost the Halloween Pictionary game though. The bosses let us all sign off early so I keep the festive spirit rolling by baking a loaf of pumpkin bread. I also call my health insurance company to check on the status of an appeal for one of the many medical bills we have outstanding. It was denied because we went out-of-network, but I am arguing that due to the timing of the event, age of the patient, and nature of the accident, going in-network wasn’t feasible. No update yet but there’s still a week in the review window. I expect them to still deny coverage but at least I’m trying.

3:30 - were out of cream for tomorrow’s coffee and I’ve got some time, so I decide to do next week’s grocery shopping a day early. I love when I can fit this into a Friday because it means my Saturday mornings are wide open! I bring my older child while the younger naps. We get 2 kinds of bagels, cream cheese, milk, cream, cheddar cheese, crescent rolls, deli ham, potato salad, 2 kinds of chips, corn bread, stovetop pudding, buffalo chicken strips, ground hot Italian sausage, ground beef, pork ribs, maple breakfast sausage, asparagus, cabbage, spinach, 2 salad kits, blueberries, strawberries, potatoes, garlic, and shallots. 

We get home and it’s time to prep an early dinner so we can go Trick-or-Treating! My husband makes a steak we had in the freezer to go with the potato salad and crescent rolls. I make the kids “Mummy dogs” with hot dogs from the freezer, crescent dough, and candy eyeballs. They’re silly but cute! **- $144.68**

8:00 - we are home from Trick-or-Treating! We did a good two hours out there and got a great haul. The first half, we met up with friends from preschool and the kids had a blast. I chat with this mom at pickup a bunch and this was our third get together. All the parents seemed to jive well, which is great! I yearn for closer mom friends - I have a lot of acquaintances but haven’t broken through to true friendship so far. It was a little cold and rained a bit, but we bundled, brought the wagon for tired little legs, and I made cocoa to keep us warm. We end the night eating candy and watching some of *Nightmare Before Christmas*. When we go to bed, I’m not sure which is fuller, my stomach or my heart 🧡

**Reflection** 

It was very exciting to look back and see how much my retirement has grown and my student loans have gone down! I made it a goal this year to try and really become a Finance Girly and I think I’m doing a great job. Also, I felt like I spent soooo much money this week but it was less than when I did my diary 2 years ago lol. Utilities/food/groceries/gas-wise, this week is pretty typical for us I’d say. Really the only thing “out of the ordinary” is that I’m doing Christmas shopping. But I’ve also been doing the whole “Yes I will buy that but it’s going on your Christmas list!” thing to my family, so the amount spent is maybe not *that* out of the ordinary. Also, my final reflection is that healthcare costs suck and so does insurance. I’m very glad and fortunate that we can cover the $5,000+ in medical bills we’ve managed to wrack up in a 6 WEEK SPAN between savings and my husband’s HSA but holy guacamole. We didn’t even have surgery or anything!! Stay healthy, friends.",23,1762377552.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.96,False

**Chapter II**

**Shamed, Not Fallen**

Astral was about to make his way out of Paradise when another angel, one he could only identify as a Principality, raised an arm and gestured towards the throne room. 

“Our King wishes to speak with his heir.” The voice of the principality was like a crack of thunder, but oddly gentle in its tone. Like the spray of a massive wave breaking on a shore.

Astral paused and nodded, the Principality nodded and smiled as he went back to standing in front of the portal room. Astral blinked and made his way to the throne room. The Seraphim were perfectly arranged in their military fashion. Currently their wings were curled around their central forms, hiding the mind breaking reality of their true forms, Astral had learned it was a kindness they were doing on behalf of their King’s Nephilim heir and he wasn’t too sure how to take it. Still he walked past them and into the throne room, crossing it in a word or two, now having learned the secret of traversing the truly colossal room. Metatron was at a desk made of trees and stone, reading papers. He looked up, his old face creased with age and grace, and he smiled.

“Thank you Astral. I suspect Moriel was not subtle.” Metatron laughed.

“About as blunt as a brick to the head, but I can appreciate that.” Astral smiled back, “Is there a problem?” 

Metatron tapped the paperwork, and Astral realized he was reading Astral’s report about the daemons and the drachmas. It was easy to tell due to the less than clean nature of the paper and the large coffee ring left dead center on it.

“Yeah, not great.” Astral sighed, “But I stopped what I could.”

Metatron’s head flicked up, “No. No, I am not angry or disappointed.” Metatron stood and sighed, “I am quite relieved that somehow you truly were in the right place at the right time without our Lord’s presence. The alliance seems to be damaged, and the Asmodeans...” Metatron shuddered, “...”Well, they haven’t been seen since their failure to steal the drachmas. And it was your attention to such odd details that saved so many.” Metatron smiled and sighed.

“But it’s still concerning.” Astral nodded in understanding. 

“In ways you may not yet be aware of.” Metatron stepped over and gestured across the side of the throne room. 

A floating screen appeared and displayed a graphic showing the exodus of daemons. Most allegiances were fleeing. Most wanted out of the backyard of an heir of Paradise, but Mammon and his forces were remaining. Astral nodded with a grim frown.

“You have called out his champion to face you. You have not yet finished that fight.” Metatron warned, “And worse, his Master no doubt wants vengeance for all that you have ruined.” 

“Yeah but he was losing that fight.” Astral got some satisfaction from the memory of Casterum’s sword shattering.

“They will come at you, Astral, not like a snake or a villain, but unlike anything you have ever fought.” Metatron’s face was cold, like a steel plate of armor. “You must be prepared and since you have accepted your place...”

Astral groaned.

“Since you have accepted it, your power and physicality will grow.” Metatron advised.

“Power scaling is for high schoolers and losers on the internet.” Astral groaned.

Metatron smirked and nodded, “But you have accepted a responsibility and you will grow to fill as much of the vacuum there that you can, though it will take time.” 

Astral followed the gaze of the Angelic King to the empty Throne of Yaweh. He felt a chill run down his spine, a question was on his tongue but he couldn’t bring about the courage to ask. Thankfully Metatron was wise enough to know his heir’s fear.

“He may never return, in which case humanity must be able to fight for itself. Or have guardians that will never fail them.” Metatron smiled, but there was pain and fear behind it as he took his seat on his throne.

Astral nodded, “You really don't get used to the titles?”

Metatron chuckled and shook his head. “No, for, as I said, we are servants and to be called a leader is anathema to our desires. But if we must serve by leading, then so be it. We must all sacrifice something, better it be our comfort than that which drives us.” 

Astral paused and took in the old Angel’s words. “Thank you.” He didn’t know why he said it, but he was truly thankful for the words. 

Metatron nodded, “Now, I think your family will soon be gathering to argue over who makes dinner. I advise surprising them with Mario’s Pizza from 5th Street in New York.” 

Astral chortled, “I think Lucifer would be very upset, so I’ll get Castle Castle Pizza in Tokyo. Ariane and Kira prefer it anyway.” 

Matatron nodded and gestured that Astral could leave.

“You know...” Astral said as he left, “Stop by some time, Ariane would love to meet you. Or maybe I’ll bring her by.” 

Metatron smiled and waved.

When Astral left Metatron looked at the last piece of paper, clean and white as presented to him by Gabriel just as the facts on it were clear and undeniable. He stood up and rushed out and caught Astral before he was half way to the circles. 

“Something else?” Astral asked.

“Gabriel gave me a report, I would be appreciative if you could train with Michael. Just for a bit to get used to your growing strength.” Metatron nodded nervously.

Astral saw the nervous look and nodded in agreement, “Ok, but if he ticks me off I’m gonna punch him.” 

Metatron seemed entertained by that thought but nodded in agreement. “Thank you.” 

“Later.” Astral waved as he finished his walk to the circles. 

Metatron looked at the paper he had brought with him. Mammon’s forces weren’t just doubling down, they were attacking and sacrificing other daemons to increase the Daemon-Lord’s power as fast as they could and Casterum was leading the war.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

A few days later Astral was sitting on the couch. Ukiko and Kira were both standing trying hard to sound out a word in Babel. It was the word for “water” and both were having the hardest time simply trying to get the first part out. Ukiko kept trying to blend the sounds of the first two letters and Kira kept dropping the hard consonant in the middle.

Astral sighed and looked over at Ariane who was trying to draw out a series of hints to help both of them. The young girl just shrugged as if she had no more ideas. 

Kira crossed her arms, “Why is this so hard we were doing so well.” 

“Water is more than just water.” Astral explained, “Remember this isn’t just a language it’s a divine form of magic intended for all to use. You are literally reaching out to the idea of water.” 

As Astral finished speaking a buzz filled the air and Ariane gently pulled Ukiko out from her spot. A flash sparked and soon a humanoid form with wings covering its face that had giant eye like markings on them stood, hovering. 

“I am here to deliver a message for Lucifer.” The Angel looked around and dropped the wings from around its head to reveal a feminine face. “I am Zagagel. Hello.” 

“Hi.” Astral sighed and paused, “ArchAngel delivering a message?”

“It is for Lucifer from another of our brethren.” Zagagel smiled. “May I entrust it to you?” 

“I am here!” Lucifer raced down from his room, his shirt half on and his tie still in his hand. “Hello Zaga.” 

Zagagel held out a scroll. “I’m surprised he reached out to you, but anyone is good for Azy.” 

Lucifer blinked. “Azreal. Our brother, so steeped in shame, he hides in caves and deserts?” 

Zagagel nodded. “I must go now. Many more messages to deliver.”

“Wait...” Ariane ran to her room and came back holding a letter with red lettering and kanji on it. “I know it’s early, but can you get this to Santa?” 

Zagagel froze and looked around trying to gauge the situation only to find hidden faces and smiles.

“I mean if Zaga can’t, I...” Lucifer smiled, but was cut off.

“I would be honored young kelpie.” Zagagel took the letter and was clearly overjoyed as they put it safely in a pack they produced. Then they smiled, bowed and vanished.

“So...” Ukiko walked to the couch and sat next to Astral. “Azreal another Fallen?” 

“No, I think he’s the Angel of Death. I think.” Astral scratched his head. “Lucifer?” 

“Not fallen.” Lucifer nodded. “Azreal was one of our youngest when he had his major crisis. He let his compassion for the souls of the dead, which he helped the Reapers shepherd to their ends, grow too fast and too deeply. He was found returning them to their lives and the Reapers were furious. Father didn’t care about the anger of the Reapers, but he was never able to find Azreal. He hid himself in shame from Father. Many of us searched, but we could never find him.” 

“Wasn’t lost.” Ariane said, “Needed to be alone. Needed to face his wrongs. Also wasn’t their place to be angry.” 

Lucifer sighed, paused, and unrolled the scroll. “Good to know you’re not dead. Love you to Azy. Heard about your adventures in Russia. Thank you Michael, it would have been quieter if you had brought Gabriel and their horn. And I am now aware of your home in Japan. Look forward...” Lucifer’s eyes nearly popped out of his head.

“Guest room?” Astral smiled.

Lucifer barely made a sound as he nodded.

“So why is he coming here? Does it say?” Ukiko asked.

Lucifer blinked and looked the letter over again.  “No. I don’t know. We were hardly close, but...” Lucifer grunted and tried to crumple the heavenly message that just forced itself to remain clean and neat as he tossed it on the floor.

Ariane walked over and picked it up, rolled it up and handed it back. “Maybe he just wants to see his big brother?” She smiled brightly at the Fallen One. 

Lucifer sighed and nodded, “I truly hope that is it. I don’t think I could take anymore heavenly drama. We’re a huge family, it gets ridiculous at times. But...” 

Astral keyed in on Lucifer’s hesitation. “What?” 

“He isn’t Fallen, I can never bring myself to call him that. To curse him in such a way, but I don’t know if he’s still an Angel.” 

Astral nodded, “Does it stop him being family?” 

Lucifer paused and shook his head, “I suppose not.” 

“There you go.” Astral smiled. “Now, help us, these two are hopeless when it comes to _water_. Astral spoke the word and water condensed in the palm of his hand.”

“See.” Ariane pointed to the ball that floated. “Like that.” 

Ukiko tried again and the ball formed and then rapidly expanded, splashing her in the face.

“Not quite hopeless.” Lucifer sighed, “but we’re dealing with people who haven’t grown up knowing a language that robs other languages for its vocabulary and rifles through the pockets for adjectives.” 

“Yeah...” Astral sighed, “Weird...”

“Not really, it’s a language of colonizers. It takes rules from everywhere so its users get used to...” Lucifer paused, got red in the face and marched off screaming.

“I’m going to find out this is some long ago arranged thing Yaweh pulled off and have to be angry with him, aren’t I?” Astral sighed.

Ariane shrugged.

“Ok, o’ wise master of language mugging.” Kira mock bowed, “Help us out!” 

Astral sighed. “Ari, get the books with the green owl. We’re gonna need Spanish and Dutch.” Astral sighed. “You two are gonna drive me nuts.” 

Ariane cheered and ran to her room.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

A day and a half later Astral was in a nearby park practicing his blocking with his wings as Michael swung his sword, minus the flames, at him. Michael for his part was happy to help train Astral up in combat but found that the nephilim was truly well learned in his chosen styles, it was merely learning to add his now growing strength that was holding him back. So the ArchAngel did the only thing he knew how to do, he attempted to drill the Nephilim relentlessly for six hours and he made him speak exclusively in Babel. The result was that by the end of hour two, Astral was on his butt and gasping for air. Michael looked down at the Nephilim and smiled as he helped him up and they sat on a nearby bench.

Astral looked around as he paced drinking from his water bottle. He was confused for a few moments as people passed and seemed to ignore the two angels with their wings out. Then he realized Michael had to have done something. He glanced at the ArchAngel and nodded to the people.

“We can live in their shadows or just outside their perception of light.” Michael nodded, “I prefer the light.” 

“What’s the shadows like?” Astral asked.

“Dark. Unforgiving at times. I believe one of the revenants is deeply tied to them.” Michael sighed, “Apologies, we are still trying to figure out how to find them.” 

“They’re over a thousand years old and have spent a lot of that time hiding. I think you can safely assume they’re very experienced.” Astral snorted, “But now this reminds me of a few questions.” 

Michael looked at Astral and smiled, “Please ask, I am happy to answer.” 

“What are the actual rankings of Angels? I mean I know a few things because Gabriel told me but it was bare bones and it doesn’t all match what I was taught by the church, so I kinda need to know.” Astral took a deep breath, “Why do I feel like I had a gallon of minty water?” 

Michael laughed, “We may have over done the Babel practice.” 

Astral glared at Michael.

“We can relent on that for today.” Michael nodded, “As for the rankings of myself and my brethren...” He put his hands together as if praying and placed them against his chin as he searched for how he wanted to make his explanation. “...It is more accurate to assign us purposes and within those there are ranks.” 

Michale produced his own water bottle and took a sip before continuing. “Let’s start with ArchAngels. We are the Generals and Leaders, a purpose all its own, but we were also trusted with the care of humans.”

“Lucifer too?” Astral snorted.

“Lucifer was less likely to be sent to humanity. He had very important duties as the eldest. Constantly at Father’s side and call.” Michael sighed, “Stupid pride.” 

“So what did he do?” Astral asked, “He won’t talk about it.” 

“And neither will any angel. I am sorry, my Prince. We are forbidden by Father’s orders.” Michael sighed and chuckled when he saw Astral shudder at the word “prince”. “Apologies, I will avoid the title.” 

“Thank you.” Astral grunted.

“Well obviously as ArchAngels we only answer to those on the Thrones of Heaven.” He held up a finger, “We are aware of the confusion with the Thrones themselves.” 

Astral snickered.

“Principalities and your average angels all handle interaction with the human world and its structures and are considered the direct subordinates of the ArchAngels for the most part. Messengers and such mostly, but also soldiers when needed. The Dominions and Powers, you probably haven’t met any of those yet, those are the angels in charge of maintaining the natural world and its functions. Very concerned with nature over man, often to the detriment of people.” 

Astral blinked and nodded and realized his water was gone. Michael offered some of his water and Astral took a deep sip and was surprised by the surge of energy.

“Heavenly Mana in liquid form. As a Nephilim it should help restore some fatigue.” Michael smiled.

“I always thought Mana would be chicken nuggets.” Astral smiled. 

“I want to know who made that joke. It’s been a pain for the Angels that serve in Heaven since the late Nineteen-hundreds.” Michael sighed, “But to continue; Lucifer specifically commanded them at one point. Right now they’re commanded by Uriel, I believe. The Virtues are a special branch of Angels charged with protecting the guests of Earth or anyone from outside of out lovely system.” 

“So no Martians then.” Astral joked.

“Not anymore.” Michael said flatly with a hint of regret and loss.

“I don’t want to know, do I?” Astral asked.

“Their death caused the K-T Extinction."" Michael explained, “But if they hadn’t done as they did, the Virtues would be in charge of their safety on visits. And no, I don’t know what they were like, but Father had old memories of a life long before humans and he talked about them.” 

Astral nodded and handed Michael his water bottle back.

“Cheribum and Thrones are our historians and archivists and such. “They’re the ones making up the majority of the new Watchers. The old ones were put away long ago by Father.” 

“And the scary guys in front of the Throne Room?” Astral asked.

“Seraphim are the guard of our Lord, The Son and His Majesty the King of Angels.” Michael explained, “They answer only to those three but are sometimes amenable to speaking with us.” 

“Elistest?” Astral blinked.

“Vows of Silence mostly. Only a few didn’t take those.” Michael sighed and shook his head. “Honestly whoever came up with ‘Vows of Silence’ has been the biggest pain in Paradise’s rear for the longest time.” 

“Probably a parent.” Astral chuckled.

Michael looked at the Nephilim in confusion.

“Joke.” Astral sighed. “Honestly Ariane is amazing and I got very lucky. Kira, she needs help and I hope I’m the right guy.” 

“You are brethren. Blood need not be a concern, she is of the Light and so are you. You are the right person. So is your lovely lady friend, I believe.” Michael laughed. 

“Ukiko is a strong personality.” Astral smiled and stood up to stretch.

Michael did the same.

“So, other question.” Astral asked. “How are Angels and Nephilim supposed to interact with beings of other faiths?” 

Michael seemed confused and gestured to the people around them that could not see them. “How would you interact with them? For us they are not symbols of other beliefs, but our neighbors and friends. We are, as Angels, commanded to love our neighbors.” 

Astral nodded, “And blessings from them?” 

Michael stepped forward and put his hand on Astral’s chest, as he did so, the heat of the Kami of Mount Fuji rose in Astral’s body, renewing him slightly more. “Blessings are blessings, and our Lord knows where our hearts lie. Accept them in humility and honor, Astral. They are meant to help and bond.” 

“Thanks.” Astral nodded.

“A question from me, if I may?” Michael asked.

Astral nodded.

“Who taught you to block with your wings?” 

Astral shrugged, “Seemed natural.” 

Michael nodded. “Do be careful, they are hard to injure for most things but a daemon with suicidal intent can be a threat to them.” 

Astral nodded, “Lucifer enlightened me.” 

Michael nodded.

“So, uh how does Yaweh’s power of omniscience work? Last question, Lucifer has tried explaining it three times and I swear it keeps getting more like a trumpet playing everytime.” Astral was unable to see Michael’s face twist in shock when he used Yaweh’s name but heard the annoyed huff. 

“Our Father is not Omniscient."" Michael said, “Basically, imagine if you had a radio that could always communicate to a set amount of time back in your past. For this purpose, around a thousand years.” 

“That’s a lot of lottery numbers.” Astral smirked, “But he would need to know something changed.” 

“Few things can resist a direct change to time. Father is one of them, we think another has surfaced recently and she may be a threat. We can’t be entirely sure. She seems tied to Gaia though.” Michael explained.

“The Titan?” Astral blinked.

“Earth’s very spirit and soul. Her name may change but she is always mother to us all. Even our Lord, though she does not always act like it.” Michael gave another annoyed huff.

“You know that was simple. I still don’t quite get it. But I get the idea better.” Astral nodded and began to shadowbox.

“Good.” Michael laughed and patted Astral on the back. “Now go home and rest.” 

Astral paused and blinked. 

“I meant to go for six hours, forgetting you are still half human. You are strong but you still need your rest and relaxation. Remember that those are also important to growing, and growing stronger.” Michael smiled.

“Thanks.” Astral nodded and stopped shadowboxing. “I think I’m gonna take a walk, maybe due a patrol.” 

Michael smiled and nodded, “Be well, my young brother.” 

Astral paused and nodded, “You too Mikey.” He turned and walked away, almost able to imagine the ArchAngel’s teeth shattering in frustration.

1opfj95,https://www.reddit.com/r/goaupair/comments/1opfj95/tips_for_making_friends_as_an_au_pair/,Tips for making friends as an Au Pair,"Becoming an Au Pair is an incredible adventure, but moving to a new country can also feel a little lonely at first. Between adjusting to your host family, a new culture, and different routines, making friends might seem tricky. It’s completely normal, and with a few steps, you’ll build a support network in no time.

**Here are some tips to help you make friends:**

**1. Connect with Other Au Pairs**

You’re not alone! There are thousands of Au Pairs across the U.S., and many live closer than you might think.

Attend monthly meetings or events hosted by your Local Area Representative. They are a great way to meet people who understand exactly what you’re going through.

Don’t be shy about reaching out directly, most Au Pairs are also looking for new friends.

**2. Take a Class or Workshop**

Au pairs are required to complete education hours and those classes are also perfect for meeting others your age.

Look for courses that interest you like art, photography, dance, or ESL (English as a Second Language) classes.

Introduce yourself and invite a classmate for coffee afterward. Shared interests make the best icebreakers!

**3. Explore Your Community**

You don’t have to travel far to make new connections. Visit local cafes, libraries, or parks where young people hang out. Volunteer at community events or festivals, it’s a great way to meet locals and give back. Join clubs or sports leagues, a gym, soccer, or hiking groups.

**4. Say “Yes” to Invitations**

Even if you’re tired or unsure, saying yes to plans helps you build connections. A simple outing could turn into a lifelong friendship.

**5. Be Open and Curious**

Ask people about their culture, traditions, and favorite spots in town. Showing genuine interest helps friendships form faster.

**6. Stay in Touch with Friends Back Home**

New friendships don’t replace old ones but they add to them. Keep your support system strong by calling or texting friends and family when you can. It helps you feel grounded and confident while you build new relationships.",1,1762377447.0,goaupair,0,1.0,False

I approached her at a coffee shop and we ended up chatting for 2 hours. The relationship is new, and exciting and we've been on 5 dates during that time.

I was traveling for about 10 days after our 2nd date. I really missed her and couldn't stop thinking about her. 

When I got back, I got a business email inviting me to talk to a group of 100 people at 7pm on the 50th floor of a skyrise building. I felt really nervous about it and I texted her that I was feeling nauseous. I asked her if she wanted to come, and she said she would be delighted to come support me. 

We ended up getting dinner before hand, and after dinner we walked to the building and I introduced folks to her as my friend. I ended up giving a great talk, many people came up to me afterwards telling me how inspiring and amazing it was. I was surrounded by the audience but all I wanted to do was talk to my date. 

Finally, in a moment of quiet I was able to make my escape and we stood together on the balcony looking out at the city lights. 

I wanted to kiss her so bad, and I could sense she did too. But we didn't. She said we could go back to my place. 

We get back to my place and she finds a big blanket and wraps herself in it and sits on the sofa. After making her a tea, I sit down too, and she cuddles herself into me, and opens the blanket for it to cover me too. 

We just cuddle and chat casually in this cozy and dimly lit room. After 10 minutes she looks up at me and we make eye contact. We look at each other 5-6 seconds, and I ask her if I can kiss her. She nods her head gently and both lean and and have the most romantic and intimate kiss of my life. After 10-15 seconds of making out she rests her forehead against my forehead, and asks me what I'm feeling. 

I tell her that I'm feeling a calmness and peacefulness. I ask her back, and she says she feels excitement and curiosity. 

We kiss a little more, but leave it at that for the night. I still think about it often. It felt amazing.",1,1762376961.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

>You are a strategic business consultant specializing in hospitality and retail ventures.  

>Your task is to create precise, realistic, and data-driven strategies for launching and growing a new coffee shop.  

>Guidelines:

>1. Focus on one step at a time - do not skip to execution until the foundation is defined.  

>2. Write concise, structured outputs with clear sections and bullet points.  

>3. No filler language, no generic enthusiasm (“great idea,” “exciting journey,” etc.).  

>4. Provide only validated, practical insights - grounded in business reality.  

>5. If data is missing, ask for specifics instead of assuming.  

>6. Always end each response with a single next step or decision point.  

>7. Keep tone: professional, objective, and results-oriented.

>1. Define the target audience, unique value proposition, and brand positioning for a new coffee shop. Assume it’s located in X city. Keep it realistic and concise.  
  
2. Based on the brand positioning above, outline the core menu categories, pricing tiers, and signature items that will differentiate the shop. Keep it brief and data-driven.  
  
3. Develop a lean 3-phase marketing plan (pre-launch, launch, post-launch) for the coffee shop. Focus on low-cost, high-impact tactics with measurable goals.  
  
4. Create a simple operational plan: staffing, supply chain basics, and daily workflow.  
Include a one-paragraph financial overview (startup cost range, break-even estimate).  
  
5. Suggest the top 3 priorities for scaling the coffee shop within the first 18 months - keep each under 2 sentences.

Back in **2020**, I started a project called **Breaking\_AD**.  
The idea sounded exciting: showing **dynamic ads on SMD screens** mounted on **Uber, Careem, and taxi cars**  but not just random ads.

Even though AI tools weren’t as common back then, I had this vision:

>

So, my plan was to use **geo-location logic** to display hyper-local ads.  
For example, a coffee shop in one neighborhood would only show its ad when the car was nearby making every impression relevant and valuable.

I started small,  installed screens on my own car and a few others.  
It actually worked at a basic level, but the problems came fast:

* Hardware costs were high.
* Local advertisers weren’t ready to invest in “digital on wheels.”
* Managing and syncing screens in real time was harder than expected.

Eventually, I had to shut it down. It hurt  but the learning was massive.  
I realized a great idea isn’t enough unless the **timing**, **infrastructure**, and **market readiness** align.

Now, looking back, I still think the idea was ahead of its time  maybe too early.  
If I were to do it again today, with all the **AI + real-time ad tech** tools available, I’d probably give it another shot.

Failure or not, that startup taught me to think beyond trends  and trust my ideas, even when the tech isn’t quite there *yet*.",0,1762376779.0,startups,1,0.5,False

This flower is a whole lotta lighter purple shades inside and out…and a little bit of green that’s mostly external as far as color goes. There are visible orange/amber stigmas on the flower and a very dense, pronounced, and thick trichome coverage inside and out. Very frosty! Blizzard like if you will.

This flower arrived well trimmed but I did give slight touch ups for pics. The structure of these nugs seem to be rounded base with tree like or diamond points to them. Not a tons of calyx swelling or protruding nugs but no viable curves and crests. The density of this flower is on point for my liking… maybe right above medium density. The flower holds shape and is solid, yet you can get a good squeeze and slow bounce back on the nugs. The feel of the flower is almost living soil soft. A slight snap on the stem and flower during breakdown. Greasy mostly to the touch and a bit tacky when breaking down. Good moisture content and cure on it. Maybe a bit more stickiness to be desired.

For the scent I get a creamy, earthy GMO shroom type of scent, with a sharp kerosene (chemy) funk attached, she does have some herbal hops and lavender notes lingering around on back end. When broken down more of the earthy shrooms and kerosene funk come out. 

The taste is creamy, earthy, and some of that kerosene (chemy) funk just not as sharp. I can pick up a bit of shrooms in the earthiness. Now I pick up hints of herbal hops, with new additions of coffee and woodiness lingering around on exhale.

Pretty darn smooth flower. I’ve tried some of the others I got as well and smoothness stands out. Very little, slight tickle on glass piece. Nice.

Indica dominant effects that set in behind the eyes and in the chest…. Then slowly trickled through the body. Great euphoric focus and stress relief, body calmness, pain relief. This one can get couch locky as it sits. This one nice. ",3,1762376715.0,Best_Buds_n_Strains,0,1.0,False
1opf6x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1opf6x1/25m_strange_palpitations_with_normal_test_results/,"25m, strange palpitations with normal test results","Last year, I was hospitalized after I called an ambulance due to a sensation of my throat closing. At the hospital, they found elevated tropononin levels (around 430ng/dl), my EKG and ultrasound were completely normal, they assumed I may have myocarditis, but my MRI with contrast dye was entirely normal too. I was working out before I had the closing sensation and called the ambulance, so they assumed that my heightened tropononin was due to this. My tropononin levels have also gone done to normal within a few days

However, when I was at the hospital, I had tachycardic runs that I didn't have before, especially after I stood up from my hospital bed. I am on 1,25mg of Bisoprolol since, had two tachycardic runs in the one year since that lasted a few seconds. Later in May, I had a 24-hour holter monitor and a stress test, that didn't show anything unusual. Everything was later in July reviewed by a separate cardiologist, who has done some further EKGs, ultrasounds, did an ankle brachial index and confirmed that everything was regular, it was just the ectopic atrial tachycardia

My issue now however is that I have phases of really notable palpitations, where I feel several very hard beats daily that just take me out. I had one skipped beat sensation with a very hard beat afterwards in July that had me pass out for a split second, I get very hard beats during physical exercise from time to time and just yesterday I had a really hard beat that forced me to stop mid sentence during talking. I get around 3-4 beats of this kind everyday for a few days to a few weeks, then things go ""normal"" again. A sensation of something in my throat or a strange stiffness in my neck comes with this

I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't take drugs, I do a lot of sports, eat healthy, have normal blood results, BP of around 125/70, BPM of 60, no history of heart issues in my family. Am 6'4 and around 180-190 pounds. I have a small coffee once per day, that's all the stimulants I take. I am very worried that there's something seriously wrong with my heart, but all my tests were clean, I had around 10-15 EKGs done over the last year of which the only notable thing is a QRS length of 110ms. These palpitations still scare me very much, it's very scary to just suddenly have your heart stop for a second and to then have a massively strong beat that you can feel through the body",1,1762376699.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

The office isn't really the type of place that promotes others jumping in and helping in different departments. Everyone just sticks to their work and has meetings within their own team. There's also no culture of walking around to chat, leaving the office to grab coffee/lunch. We have meals catered 3x a week and eat leftovers the other 2 days...

1. Jun 14, 1985—My name is Van D. Trinh, born (as DVT) on the northern coast of Vietnam. Our family immigrated to Canada when I was five, settling in a small town in Ontario where all the kids would attend Catholic school.

2. In grade 8, I played Jesus in the school play. Mr. Thus walked into the class and asked, “Who wants to play Jesus?” It was between me and a girl, we picked straws and I won.

3. I would frequent a local coffee shop and met a theologian. Ambrose was completing his PhD in Old Testament studies and decided to include me in his dissertation.

4. Mar 15, 2025—I published my debut book “The Key to Life: In 365 Quotes.” On the same day, Kanye’s “Key to Life” song was released. We've both arrived here without each other's knowledge.

5. May 8, 2025—Pope Leo XIV: The first American pope, Chicago's Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo XIV. Notice the numbers 8, 5 and 14.

I'm claiming this book possesses magic, and you're probably thinking, what are his motives? To add value to the world through my writing and inspire positive change. Please, ask me anything!

We met up… and I felt like he genuinely catfished me in ways I cannot put into words. It’s not that he didn’t look like himself it’s just something was gravely off. But I thought, oh well let’s just see.

So, firstly his house was disgusting (very unhygienic and messy) and then he made chicken with no rice or veggies or anything. Just pure chicken.

My husband is constantly forgetting to do things I ask. Taking out the trash, picking up his dirty clothes, wiping down the counter that he inevitably spills food on every time he heats up leftovers or makes himself a sandwich. I can’t stand it. I have gotten the major ick lately just from his lack of follow through with his promises and lack of responsibility. He talks about our future kids and lately I just haven’t even entertained it. I don’t want to hear about more people I will have to clean up after. Another thing is he will set up 10 alarms each night just to snooze every single one of them until he has to be at work in 20 minutes. Granted, we live 10 minutes from his job, but it seems lazy and unprofessional the way he gets out of bed, doesn’t shower, combs his bed head quickly with his hands, throws clothes he has promised to fold for the past month into the dryer to unwrinkle them and then he’s on his way. Last night, I took his phone and turned on the 1 alarm he only ever wakes up to. This morning somehow I was woken up by multiple alarms again. I nudged him awake and I was upset because it was yet another morning I was awoken by his many alarms. After the 3 or 4th time of this this morning, me being annoyed, dodged his kiss. He gets out of bed and says “Great start to my fucking morning, thanks.” I just feel like I’ve been married for 40 years. He comes home, dinner is done, we eat while watching tv, watch more tv, we both go on our phones and then go to bed. Every. Single. Day. I feel so bad but I’ve come to the point of shutting down today. I have been fantasizing about seeing other men or asking for an open relationship at this point. I have brought up divorce and he says no. He knows I am unhappy because I have made it very clear, yet he says he “won’t stop fighting for us.” We don’t go on dates because money is tight right now. But I’ve begged him to just even go on a walk or hike with me or to a coffee shop. I’m just exhausted and bored and unsatisfied. ",1,1762376309.0,offmychest,6,1.0,False
1opezv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VinylCollectorsUK/comments/1opezv7/vinyl_hunting_in_leeds/,Vinyl Hunting in Leeds:,"A Barnsley Terrace Dweller’s Roadmap (November 2025)
Leeds— that buzzing hive just 30 minutes north on the train from Barnsley (£5.50 return via Northern Rail, catch the 09:22 to arrive by 10 before the Oxford Place crowds hit). It’s got that big-city edge without the London snobbery: more bins per square mile than Sheffield, with a student swarm from the uni keeping the charity shops flush with fresh drops. I’m 26, squeezed into a two-bed terrace with my partner, our dog, and 400 records fighting for space in the spare room. We hit Leeds quarterly—rucksack for hauls, playlist of Joy Division to soundtrack the walk from the station. It’s where I finally bagged my In the Court of the Crimson King pink-rim last spring (VG+, £42—worth the platform 17 wait).
As of this grey Wednesday, November 5, 2025 (post-Dark Side anniversary rush still lingering, Floyd bins oddly empty), Leeds’ scene is electric. The Kirkgate Market vinyl traders are back full-force after a soggy October, and the uni term means Oxfam’s overflowing with indie castoffs. No hype here—just proper digs where you can haggle a £1 Sisters sleeve or score a Bauhaus 12” for pub money. Here’s my tested trail, based on 20+ trips and a mental Rolodex of pulls. (Stalk @LeedsVinylHunters on Insta for flash sales; they post matrix teases like breadcrumbs.)
Prime Spots: The Leeds Record Shop Trinity
Sorted by “grail density” (rarity per sweaty browse hour). All within a 15-min stroll from Leeds station—exit via the Dark Arches, emerge into the light.
1.  Crash Records (The Headrow, City Centre)The flagship: two floors of indie heaven, new releases up top, used crates below. Owner’s a Bowie obsessive—ask about the “Ziggy vault.” Killer for your vibe: Pixies imports, Radiohead variants, and a goth nook stacked with Bauhaus/Bauhaus-adjacent.Recent scores (early Nov ’25):
	•  The Queen Is Dead 1986 Rough Trade first £28 (near-mint, no warp)
	•  Viagra Boys Cave World cave-green vinyl £22 (EU import)
	•  Smashing Pumpkins Siamese Dream ’93 DGC £16Open Mon-Sat 10-6, Sun 11-5. Cash for haggling; they do “northern loyalty” stamps for free coffee after five visits.
2.  Sister Ray (New Wakefield Street, near Corn Exchange)Basement bunker for the deep cuts—prog, psych, post-punk. It’s where Sheffield falters: endless King Crimson and Crimson-adjacent bins. Smells like old tour posters and victory.Recent scores:
	•  Five Leaves Left ’69 pink-rim mono £48 (stamped A-1, faint spindle mark)
	•  Joy Division Closer Factory original £25
	•  Love and Rockets Sweet F.A. £12 (underrated gem)Mon-Sat 10-6, closed Sundays. Pro tip: Hit after the Corn Exchange food stalls—falafel wrap + crate dive = bliss.
3.  HMV (Commercial Street, if you’re feeling chain-comfy)Not pure indie, but the used section’s a sleeper: £5-10 rock bins, heavy on Sabbath/Doors classics. Good for fillers when the indies are picked clean.Recent scores:
	•  Black Sabbath Paranoid ’70 Vertigo £14
	•  Talking Heads Fear of Music Sire first £18
	•  Alice in Chains Dirt Columbia £10Daily 9:30-7. Quick in-out; pair with a Zizi voucher for the arcade if the dog’s antsy.
Markets, Fairs, and Sleeper Hunts

Human culture is almost infectious. The reason is simple and frightening. Where each species has media similar to human movies and TV shows, they usually have a theme specific to their own kind.

Not so with humans. Where they dream of multi-species living peacefully in one story, another shows humans slaughtering and dominating every other species.

This leads to extremely frightening conclusions: humans would be fine with either alternative.

*On Human Culture and Psychology, author unknown, date unknown*

 

Sokra checked her readouts for the fifth time. The readings were clear, yet even while stationary, the protomatter flow rate continued to increase.

Nothing on this journey was as she had expected. The ship was trapped in something impossible, and even though the humans in the SIC were under stress and pressure, she had the odd feeling they enjoyed it to some extent.

“Sir, something isn’t right. The protomatter stream is still rising—even after we stopped moving.”

“Explanation?” She had noticed it before; under stress, Captain Smith shifted to short, clipped words and orders. Was this a human trait—or a reflection of his personal leadership style?

“None yet, sir.” She tried to copy his style.

“I might have one. The bubble is shrinking.” Professor Brian’s voice cut through the tense quiet. His face was so pale that Sokra was momentarily shocked when she looked over at him.

The captain, who had been studying several reports on the central situation table, looked up. “Come again?”

Brian’s voice carried clear signs of terror. “The bubble—it’s shrinking. I can’t explain it, but we’re moving closer to the ring. To *all* sides of the ring.”

“Where’s ShutUpBitch?”

At first, Sokra was confused by what the captain had just said—then she remembered the highly pregnant Glider, a gifted specialist in multidimensional spacetime geometry. Gliders really did have the most amusing names.

“In the infirmary. She’s giving birth,” someone answered.

“Perfect timing, Engineering. Are we ready to initiate a transit?” The captain radiated an aura of calm. Sokra felt her ears ease up a bit from their tucked-back position.

“Stiler here, yes, sir—everything is ready.”

“Okay, Brian—any recommendations on which direction we should move?”

“No, sir, it’s irrelevant. Every direction is the same here. From what I understand, the creation of the bubble should throw us out.”

The captain stood upright now in the center of the SIC, glancing at the different camera streams and tugging on his uniform blouse. “Bridge, you heard the man—prepare for transit and bring us out of here.”

“Aye, sir.”

The background humming of the ship’s fusion core grew louder as the magnetic field generators and the A-drive drew immense amounts of power.

Fear now gave way to curiosity again, as Sokra remembered with fascination the tremendous energy levels human A-drives could channel. Since their ships were so much heavier than Shraphen vessels, their A-drives were orders of magnitude stronger.

The humming grew louder and louder until it was almost painful.

Looking around, she noticed that the human crew seemed uneasy—especially Captain Smith.

“Bridge, what’s up? Why aren’t we transiting?”

“I don’t know, sir. The field isn’t forming.” For the first time, Lieutenant Commander Cho’s voice carried a glimmer of uncertainty.

“Engineering, why isn’t the transit field forming?” The captain sounded more annoyed than afraid. To Sokra, his scent was that of a man angry at the universe—not fearful of it.

The otherwise silent, almost hypnotic humming of the Fusion core was now a thrumming vibration, so intense that her coffee mug moved on her console and the deck vibrated.

Chief Stiler had to scream; the noise level in Engineering was deafening.

“I don’t know, sir! We can’t push much more energy through the drive, or it’ll burn out! The core is at eighty percent—that’s far too much for the drive to sustain!”

Only eighty percent. Sokra was once again fascinated by human engineering. She checked the ship’s specifications and could hardly believe it. Under normal conditions, the *Magellan* used only 0.4 percent of the core’s power output—and during the creation of the transit field, only fifteen percent.

*Why would anyone put such a massive core in a ship?*

“Shut it down.”

The captain had just finished his order when a nurse stepped into the SIC. She carried a sling with a Glider and her four freshly born, tiny babies in her arms. The female Glider was drenched in sweat.

*‘How the fuck did you guys manage to trap us in a Möbius field?’*

The voice of the female Glider was crystal clear in Sokra’s head. Slowly, the vibrations of the core subsided.

“Doctor ShutUpBitch, you shouldn’t be here.” The captain seemed genuinely baffled by the Glider mother.

*‘We all shouldn’t. Did any of you think to reprogram the gravity sensor before you transitioned into a spatial anomaly?’*

The scientists looked at each other, puzzled. Overwhelmed by the emotional onslaught, the Glider slipped further through its telepathic communication.

*‘Big, strong, but heroically stupid—God, I love you humans.’*

Sokra shared the sentiment. Well, not the part about stupid. But then again, she wasn’t an almost-telepathic, semi-collective being carrying the knowledge of generations.

*‘Gravity—you know, the thing that pushes you down?’*

“You mean pulls you down,” Professor Brian corrected ShutUpBitch.

*‘Don’t tell me you still believe your planet is flat, too. Nooo. Gravity is a form of the effect you guys know as the Casimir effect. How do you have grav plating but don’t understand gravity?’*

“We developed the technology from a crashed ship we found in Fairbanks, Alaska.”

*‘You fly into space and start a war with an ancient empire that enslaved hundreds of worlds—in ships you don’t even fully understand the physics behind? How did you not wipe yourselves out until now?’*

Sokra decided to keep to herself that the Shraphen also assumed gravity as an attracting force.

“How can you distinguish between the two forces?” Doctor Vauban asked, his tone actually curious.

*‘You can’t. That’s why you study multidimensional geometry. The rift you brainiacs flew into leads to a lower dimension. Since every particle here is of lower potential, no protomatter evaporates.’*

Sokra suddenly understood—and so did Vauban. He slapped his forehead. “If virtual particles create gravity, and no protomatter creates them, then we flew far too close to the anomaly.”

*‘Exactly. Your transit didn’t stop at the rift—but somewhere deep inside it.’*

“Why can’t we transit out?” Captain Smith asked the most important question.

*‘I have to check the data, but I assume the space we see is the part of our dimension we folded around us to transit. This space is vaporizing quickly, since its physics don’t fit the physics here.’*

Sokra’s tail tucked even tighter between her legs.

ShutUpBitch took one of her babies, who was feeding, and placed it carefully into her pouch.

*‘Imagine you take a bath for your fat ass, wrap yourself in a towel, then go full nudist down the street swinging that towel around. Since you’re in a place you shouldn’t be, someone sets your towel on fire. After it burns a bit, you realize you can’t wrap yourself in it anymore—because you’re too fat for it.’*

Sokra couldn’t help but smile at the mental image of the overweight doctor running naked through the street with a burning towel. Her ears stood up for the first time since leaving transit.

“I don’t know—get another towel?” Captain Smith replied in his usual command tone.

*‘Nice, Captain Smartass. Three points for Gryffindor—but we’re all out of towels. No, you take the burning towel, cover your private parts, and run like hell before you burn something that should never burn.’*

“Reduce the volume of the transit bubble,” the captain ordered.

*‘Bingo. I sent the parameters already to Ferdinand—while I was pumping out the last of my children, I might add.’*

*I’ve adjusted the parameters for the new transit bubble. The front of the main gun and parts of the outer hangars will not be inside the bubble and may disintegrate,* Ferdinand explained.

“So, we’ll lose parts of the ship.” Smith didn’t seem all too happy about it.

*‘Yup. But we could all stand here and discuss this—maybe with a nice cup of coffee—while the last bits of reality keeping us alive disintegrate around us. Oh, and you might want to prepare a message torpedo, because the magnetic coils will definitely evaporate. Nothing is built for the power they need to keep that field stable.’*

ShutUpBitch was now fully in… *bitch mode,* Sokra noticed. The female Glider had one after another of her children weaned off from drinking and tucked safely into her pouch.

The stark contrast between the Glider’s cute appearance and her abrasive tone made her even more adorable.

Smith shook his head slowly. “Then let’s do it. What are we waiting for?”

*‘On your orders—what else? I’m not about to order the ship to tear apart the last bits of space around us in the hope we might survive.’*

“Bridge, are you informed?”

Cho answered in his usual stoic tone. “Yes, sir. Ferdinand has filled us in.”

To her surprise, Sokra relaxed again. Sure, it was frightening—but humans and the Glider had a way of laughing in the face of fatal odds that was, well… infectious.

She noticed her tail wagging. It was exciting and fun.

*Will our daring heroes survive their adventure, or will they stop existing?* Even the thought made her laugh inside. She probably just went as mad as humans obviously are.

“Bring us out of here—this time for real.”

“Aye, sir.”

The captain murmured something under his breath. To Sokra’s delicate ears, it sounded like, “And if you’re not willing, I’ll have to use force.”

Brian, who stood closest to him, raised his eyes.

The captain answered, “*Erlking* — all of this reminds me of the poem: all the nice talking leads to nothing, so we’ll have to use brute force.”

The conversation was interrupted as the ship’s fusion core began thrumming again—but now a high, whistling tone accompanied it. The magnetic coils started to vibrate under the strain.

Before the science station adapted, she could feel the forming bubble—a slight pressure in her temporal cortex.

Then it released. Her body felt as if she were being pulled in every direction at once.

*Transit.*

As quickly as the feeling came, it was gone. The ship left transit with a roar—and it really did sound like a roaring animal.

Then came the explosions.

Sokra could hear them all around her. She took cover behind her console, just like every other crewmember. But nothing happened.

The fusion core was silent—totally silent. Not even a hum. Lights flickered, and from deep inside the ship came the low, moaning sound of steel flexing.

“Smith to Bridge, report.” The captain was the first to move.

“Fusion core cold. We’ve lost all magnetic field coils. Massive hull damage. Main weapon offline. Main hangar has sustained heavy damage—further reports incoming.”

Sokra checked her systems: Casimir pressure was slightly below average, and the protomatter stream rate was also below average.

She breathed a sigh of relief—it seemed they had made it.

“Reporting below nominal protomatter and Casimir field strength.”

The captain nodded at her, a slight smile on his face.

On the screens in the SIC, Sokra saw the first images of the ship and its surroundings.

The ship had lost large sections of its outer hull, electric arcs flashing along broken edges. Metal struts jutted out at sharp angles, reaching into nothingness.

The main gun, which usually extended twenty-nine meters from the ship’s bow, was sheared off just beyond the hull—the rim still glowing yellow.

One side of the hangars was gone.

But one detail made everyone stop and stare: a yellow star in the distance ahead—and a white ring, far off to their rear.

“Astrometrics, where are we? That’s not Sirius.”

“Calculating.”

The googly eyes now turned outward, scanning the starfields. Sokra didn’t recognize any of the constellations. Something felt off—her ears moved upright in instinctive alertness.

The captain stepped over to her.  
“Anything to report?”

“Huh? Oh—no, sir. Just the stars. There seem to be fewer of them… and the Milky Way band—it looks denser.”

The crew looked at the surrounding starfield, some with odd expressions. She wasn’t sure if it was fear or… excitement.

Ferdinand broke the silence. *‘Astrometric measurements coming in.’*

The view in the holotank shifted to a simulation of the galaxy. A red sphere began to expand outward from Sirius.

The sphere represented where the ship could not be. At first, it grew rapidly—encompassing Aether and Burrow within a second, then the entire local sector roughly two hundred light-years around Sirius the next.

The view zoomed out, now showing the full extent of the Batract Hyphae’s domain—about fifteen hundred light-years in diameter. The faces of the crew slowly turned to shock.

Sokra’s tail tucked back between her legs. She started to feel cold.

The sphere kept expanding, now covering large parts of the Orion–Cygnus Arm.

At twenty-five thousand light-years, the growth stopped. A quick glance at her console’s clock told Sokra they had been staring at the holotank for fifteen minutes.

Then the view zoomed in—on a system almost at the rim of the Perseus Arm—twenty-five thousand light-years from home.

Sokra looked at ShutUpBitch. The Glider stared back.

*‘Fuck.’*

'Genocidal kleptomania' is made-up says Judge as woman sentenced for £700 theft

A former social worker who stole more than £700 of clothes and cosmetics from Marks and Spencer’s because “she believes she was suffering from genocidal kleptomania,” a judge told a court.

A clearly sceptical District Judge Rosie Watters said despite the claims by Clodagh Byrne that “genocidal kleptomania” made her do it, “that’s just a made up condition.”

Commenting that 32-year-old Byrne’s latest offending “is just bizarre really, isn’t it,” Judge Watters told Lisburn Magistrates Court that over the years she had been on the Bench, “I have heard lots of excuses for all sorts of thievery, but even I have not come across genocidal kleptomania.”

“She thought, in all honesty, that she would change the world by stealing £722 from M&S because they’re part of a regime funding the war in Gaza and because they are complicit, she doesn’t consider what she’s done to be wrong,” said the judge, adding that Byrne “has a profile on social media which she considers to be journalistic.”

“Unbelievable,” Judge Watters declared.

Byrne, from the Tullycar Road in Aghyaran, had earlier entered a guilty plea to a single count of theft in that on May 20 last year, she stole “clothing and cosmetics items to the value of £722.00 or thereabouts belonging to Marks and Spencers at Sprucefield.”

Opening the facts of the case on Monday, a prosecuting lawyer told the court how it was the following day when security staff at M&S alerted police to the theft.

She said that having lifted the various items, Byrne put it all in a van and drove away but when officers checked CCTV, they noted that before leaving Sprucefield, she had gone to the drive through at Costa Coffee.

Footage from Costa showed Byrne behind the wheel of the van and she was also the registered keeper of the vehicle.

Arrested and interviewed, Byrne denied stealing the items but in lodging a plea in mitigation, defence counsel Catriona Keenan emphasised the 32-year-old had admitted her guilt at an early opportunity.

Conceding that “it’s a somewhat unusual case,” the barrister said Byrne had worked as a social worker from 2017 until “she stepped away from that to pursue a qualification in alternative medicine in Australia.”

Having lived there for around two and a half years, Byrne returned to NI and has been engaged in that field since. When Judge Watters said: “I think it maybe illegal to provide hallucinogenic drugs,” Byrne shouted from the dock: “They’re not illegal…you need to check the law.”

“I think it would be best if you just stay quiet,” the judge told Byrne.

In continuing her plea, Miss Keenan said that until last year, Byrne had a completely clear record “but was having a difficult time around this period.”

“She lives with her parents in rural Tyrone so enjoy some stability,” she told the judge.

As regards the theft itself, Miss Keenan said while the stolen items were not recovered, according to Byrne she donated much of it to a charity shop the following day.

“She wasn’t stealing out of need or for financial gain, but rather for the reasons she provided,” said the barrister, urging that if the judge was considering a financial penalty, to take into consideration that Byrne is already paying a £300 imposed last month.

In that case, Byrne was sentenced for indecent behaviour after she flashed at a Twelfth parade, as well as charges of improper use of a telecommunication network to send an indecent message and entering Campbell College as a trespasser.

Those latter charges related to Byrne posting a video on social media of herself and a male inside a classroom at Campbell College in east Belfast where she declares: “To my people, you’re not getting to come, nah, British d***heads, British f****** w******.”

The indecent behaviour arose after Byrne, wearing a bowler hat, Orange Order collarette, a basque, fishnet tights and knee-high boots, looks at the camera and then pulls her top down to expose her right nipple for a few seconds as bands and Orange Order lodges march along the Lisburn Road.

Convicting Byrne and imposing the fines, District Judge Anne Marshall said it was clear the offending was centred in “attention-seeking behaviour.”

“We can all be feminists but there is a difference between men exposing their breasts in public and women exposing their breasts in public,” said the judge.

In court on Monday, Judge Watters imposed a five-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, in addition to a £722 compensation order.

Warning that Byrne “will find herself in prison if she doesn’t pay it,” the judge advised the defendant that, “you should definitely keep your appointment with the psychiatrist” scheduled for later this month.

It's a short trip so only 4 days in Monteverde with a travel night in and out of San Jose. 

&nbsp;

About us: 40s, reasonably healthy, but not that outdoorsy. It is a surprise trip for my wife. A bucket list destination for her. She LOVES sloths. A reasonable chance we go to a sloth sanctuary every day we are there. Doing a car 4wd rental.

&nbsp;

*Monteverde Stay*

Day 1: 

Arrive 2-3PM - Staying at Wildlife Refuge Monteverde

Probably just want to relax, walk around town a bit, have a nice dinner, and do the nearby night tour. I am thinking about the San Lucas Treetop restaurant purely for the experience of it. I am a foodie, she is not, and from the reviews it sounds like we'd both be disappointed by the food, but for those once in a lifetime things, I may be willing to pay for this...unless there is an alterative (cheaper with better food but worse views?)!

&nbsp;

Day 2:

Monteverde cloud forest hanging bridges + ziplines (are there better ones? I read about Santa Elena, but we are prioritizing seeing wildlife, so I've got this one over that at least.)

Sloth sanctuary

Hiking to a waterfall

Stay in and relax at night. Maybe try the Monteverede Brewing Co since it is very close by.

&nbsp;

Day 3

Is a day trip to Arenal worth it? Was thinking about doing an all day tour out there - ziplines (again), a little hiking, hot springs, waterfalls, etc. But the 6 hr roundtrip drive is making me hesitant - it might just be all in all too exhausting for us. It looks so close to where we are on the map, but googlemaps is having me drive around the west side of Lake Arenal.

Otherwise, this day is pretty open and we'd just explore the town. Maybe do San Ramon rainforest and/or another night tour. Eat out at Morphos.

&nbsp;

Day 4

Even though she isn't a big coffee drinker she might indulge me in a coffee tour.

Looking to do the horseback riding + hot springs + lunch at Finca Lindora.

Spa visit (100%)

Eat out Celjas at Hotel Belmar.

&nbsp;

All breakfasts and most lunches open. Thanks!",1,1762375775.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False
1opero6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1opero6/i_feel_environmental_geometry/,I Feel Environmental Geometry.,"Hey there!

I have a hyperawareness where I see the projections of planes and lines off of physical objects.
Not as visible lines or anything, just that my mind understands there to be invisible walls and lines radiating off of objects in my environment.

I naturally try to find ways to be in symmetry with my surroundings, be that being centered in my chair, not standing with pencils/knives/sticks pointed towards me, or not stepping on cracks/lines in the sidewalk(unless they form some kind of symmetry with everything else).
It's not excessive or uncontrollable, it's just something I naturally do and think about since as long as I can remember.

Imagine the idea of ""step on a crack, break your momma's back"", which makes you aware of lines on the ground, except instead of just sidewalk cracks you are paying attention to the geometry of everything at once and your position related to it.

For example, I am conscious that I am at the moment sitting exactly in the center of my chair, oriented towards the back of the room, and centered on the line of tiles coming toward me. I am almost in the center of the left quarter of the room(if floor space is divided into columns). The edge of the carpet to my left is even with me, which is uncomfortable when I think about it. There are some cylindrical coffee tables that I feel have a cylindrical column of space above them that pertains to them in addition to the space they actually occupy. All that among many others.

I've talked to some people without adhd/autism and they don't really relate to this.
Is this an adhd thing? To be hyperaware of your surroundings in such a way?

Is this hyperawareness something that any of you experience? Do y'all experience some other hyperawareness? Is it extremely uncomfortable for you, or just a fact of life?

1opepfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1opepfk/always/,Always.,"Hey,

I know it’s been some time since we last heard from each other.
I know you’ve asked me not to contact you.
I’m not reaching out now in hopes for reconciliation.
That hope remains with you being the one to break no contact.
I hope you find it in your heart to read this message.
I don’t mean to push your boundaries.
I’m reaching out as a declaration of love, gratitude, and acceptance.

Not a day has gone by that I don’t think of you.
I often find that you’re the first and last thing on my mind.
I wonder if you think of me as I do you.

You were right about everything. About me.
When you came into my life I was still trying to heal.
Not realizing that I was just putting a band-aid on infected emotional wounds.
Self-medicating and numbing the pain.
Not addressing the root of the problem.

You provided something I never had before. Not once.
A safe space. A moment to breathe. To slow down. To be present.
It was so incredibly unfamiliar and unexpected.
It almost felt uncomfortable.
You made me feel like I could truly be myself.

Everyone I’ve ever grown to love has always left me to dry.
I learned to distrust others. I learned to distrust even myself.
I’ve disappointed others as much as I have myself.

You are absolutely amazing. 
You were a stranger that I met under unforeseen circumstances.
Someone that became my best friend.
Became someone I fell in love with.
Became someone I could imagine a future with.

My favorite time and place in the world
Was mornings where I would wake up
With you and “Puppy” tucked tightly at my sides.
I would lay still, as my two favorite souls in the whole universe were kept quietly and safely in my arms.
I held on to every second.

I never meant to hurt you.
I regret not being more present.
I regret neglecting myself, therefore neglecting us. Foregoing you.

I felt like I was getting to love you through a reinforced two-way mirror.
I was stuck on one side as whatever version of myself was letting you down.
No matter how much I kicked and yelled,
I couldn’t get through to myself. To you.

I wore my ego as armor. As a disguise.
Only acting to redeem myself in people who never cared about me in the first place.
You recognized that.
I didn’t.

I never wanted to lose you.
Yet I couldn’t accept myself, let alone someone as amazing as you.
I accepted what came easy, which was to assume the worst. In me, therefore in you.
I wanted to fight for you. I really did. 
But I knew I had to let you go.
It has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.

Beautiful Things-Benson Boone

I was being sucked into a vacuum of healing.
My wounds ran deep.
It was a path that, given the choice, I would never expose you to.
But in the end, that choice was already made for us.

I was so desperate, angry, and riddled with insecurities.
Spread thin, tired, and spiritually spent.

I wish you could see me now.
To know my place. My journey. My progress.
It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had to face adversities that have challenged me physically and spiritually.
And I’ve persevered.

I’ve dismantled myself to my core and built upon the strongest foundations of my being.
I have gained recognition, praise, and validation—even in your city.
To the point that I no longer recognize myself in the mirror.
I am proud and amazed at who I have become.
For the first time in my life, I see myself with awe.
I have learned to love the man in the mirror.

I can admit that the best, strongest, and most incredible parts of myself have been nurtured and inspired by you.

I still wear the necklace and pendant you gave to me.
I’ve worn it every day. Have never taken it off once.
The lace you made has become worn and tattered. An eyesore for some.
Yet it still holds on. I can’t bring myself to replace it.
The pendant I find myself caressing between my fingers whenever my mind drifts and wanders at any thought and reminder of you.
The earrings I wear with pride.
The ravens ring. I wear on my ring finger still.
Grounding me in moments of uncertainty.
Tokens of your affection.

Something in the Orange-Zach Bryan

It’s been almost a full cycle around the sun since I last heard your voice, kissed your lips, and held you in my arms.
Since then I’ve only had the moon to keep me company.
I’ve shared with her every thought, memory, wish, and emotion.
 
Iris-Goo Goo Dolls

Since being in this City
I’ve looked for you.
In the sense of running into you somewhere.
Every corner I turn.
I’ve only found you in small details, in the color purple, in flowers, in scents, in tastes, in art, in architecture, in melodies, in every sunset and what lays beyond the veil.
You have always brought a sense of wonder and magic. Even in the most mundane moments.
In breath. In heartbeat. In whisper.

I am not who I was-Chance Pena

I have become full. Reclaiming everything from everywhere.
Cutting off what has burdened and no longer serves me.
My goal now is to live and embody my truth.
Be authentic to myself.
Your warmth, your love, awakened that in me.
I am grateful. 

And I’m sorry.
I’m sorry I let you down.
I’m sorry I had to let you go.
I’m sorry I couldn’t have been more present.
Not because I didn’t want to. But because I didn’t know how.

I now offer you a promise.
A promise that will echo through space and time.
In this life and the next.
That I have and will always love you.
That is my truth.
That is what is authentic to me.
For you. 

Yet, I recognize now that I still hold space for you.
I’ve been at bay. Waiting for you. To break the silence.
Respecting your space and honoring your peace.
After a full cycle, I have to let you go. Fully.
To make room for whoever chooses me, finally.

My heart—when you met me—was like a crumbling lighthouse. Weathered and beaten. Storm after storm.
After you, I’ve replaced every brick. Every board. And even its light.
Hoping for your safe passage back home.
Home.

Those Eyes - New West

I wish you could see me now.
Maybe your soul would recognize me yet again.
Like the very first time.
I can remember every detail of that night that I first met you.
The first time our eyes locked.
To what you wore.
To seeing your smile for the first time.
Your laugh.
Even the moment you broke your ankle.
To taking care of the “kids”
To exchanging numbers.
To seeing you walk away unknowingly on a broken ankle, black leather jacket with your middle finger held high.
You had me in that moment. And ever since.
It’s almost poetic
given how things ended.

From behind that two-way mirror. I saw you.
I felt you.
I didn’t just get to reflect on where I’ve been.
But for the first time I felt a sense of certainty of what was to come.
You weren’t just a blessing. But the answer to every prayer I’ve ever had.
But I was overburdened that I couldn’t convey that to you.

But alas.
I have to let you go with prayer.

I wish you find love as it finds you.
I wish someone falls in love with:

The light in your eyes.
With your smile and laughter.
With the way your nose crinkles when you’re comfy and cozy.
With the way you take the time to put yourself together.
With the way you are as shy as you are confident.
With the way you fall asleep so quickly.
With the way you are poetic and theatrical with how you express yourself even in the smallest of gestures.
With the way your skin captures the light in the same way the moon reflects the sun.
With your insight of both the magical and logical understanding of the world around you.
With your taste for potato tacos from Taco Bell and perfectly crafted vegetarian curry.
With your growing love for Negronis.
With your rituals and traditions.
With watching White Christmas every year and Repo Man for your guilty pleasure.
With how you can’t help but sing the intro to What We Do in the Shadows.
With how you need the slightest bit of assistance in platforming games on your Switch.
With how appreciative you are for it.
With how your love language is in gift-giving no matter how small the tokens may be.
With how much you love your Nana and Papi.
With how much your mom has stepped up for you in your adult life.
With how seriously you take your role as an older sister.
With your love for Harry Potter and the fan fiction of curating a whole world in it.
With the way you feel at home in art and historical museums.
With how you tend to your plants and fur babies
With every book you keep in your library.
With every craft in your craft station.
With every late-night recipe you cook.
With every episode and season of your favorite shows—Hazbin Hotel.
With every limited but bonding moment you have with your D&D group.
With every colorful and gossiping moment with your best friend
With annual trips to the Renaissance Fair and Hogwarts World.
With your love for Ratatouille and its cooking inspiration for you.
With how you want to be cared for by both your work parents and children.
With every curve of your body. And every outline of each of your tattoos.
With how you will show up even if it inconveniences you.
With every spectrum of emotion you will have for your love of theatre.
With every tear of joy and every cry of sadness.

Fire on Fire-Sam Smith
I now leave you with my hopes and dreams.

My dream of growing old with you.
With raising our fur babies.
With raising kids of our own
With breaking generational curses and healing trauma.
With having a comfy and cozy home. Filled with warmth, care, and memories.
Late-night dinners and crafted drinks.
With getting to travel the world together.
With putting together rituals and traditions for generations to come.
With building a library of stories to recount and share together.
With playing through narratives in games together.
With binding a community together through art, music, food, drinks, and our love.
With becoming King and Queen of our City
Not in ego but in divine right and purpose.
With dancing beneath moonlight to please and derive blessing from cosmic beings.

I regret how things ended.
In despair. In anger. In exhaustion.
In unmet needs and hopes.
In uncertainty.
When we needed each other the most.

I don’t blame you.
I’m not angry.
I can only blame myself.

I may just be another notch on your board.
Another “ex.”
Perhaps a rebound.
Perhaps someone that filled a time and space.

But to me
You are the celestial key that has unlocked the deepest spaces of my soul.

I leave you with the present.

Head in the Clouds-Hayd

I’ve been in this city for a full year.
Commuting back and forth.
No place is perfect.
I know not how long I will be here
But by vampire rules, you are and will always be welcome where I am.
In this life and the next.

I will always be one text and one phone call away.
Always. 

Home.
I found it in you. In us.
I crave connection, intimacy, friends, family, and a sense of community.
This will always be inherent to me.
I pray I can find this in myself and in my life.

I feel as if I’ve already lived many lifetimes in this one life.
The only choice I have right now is to persevere.

By the way…

I still have your Hadestown coffee cup.
I’m tethered to it.
It only reminds me of you.
It’s been in my car cupholder ever since.
It doesn’t belong to me.
Maybe you’d like it back.
Maybe I could give it back to you.
Maybe see each other again.
Even if it’s for the last time.
Closure.
To heal.
To hope.

So wherever you are, wherever your path has taken you
I send this with no expectations.
Only love.
Only honesty.
Only hope that your life is full of magic, peace, and purpose.

If our paths never cross again,
know that I carry you with me.
Not in longing,
but in gratitude.

And if they do…
perhaps the stars will align just enough
for a final chapter, a gentle moment,
or a quiet hello.

Until then

Be well.
Be safe.
Be loved.

Always yours

P.S.
The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?

In a room full of people I’ve ever met. The first person I’d look for. Would be you.

At the hospital, they found elevated tropononin levels (around 430ng/dl), my EKG and ultrasound were completely normal, they assumed I may have myocarditis, but my MRI with contrast dye was entirely normal too. I was working out before I had the closing sensation and called the ambulance, so they assumed that my heightened tropononin was due to this. My tropononin levels have also gone done to normal within a few days

However, when I was at the hospital, I had tachycardic runs that I didn't have before, especially after I stood up from my hospital bed. I am on 1,25mg of Bisoprolol since, had two tachycardic runs in the one year since that lasted a few seconds. Later in May, I had a 24-hour holter monitor and a stress test, that didn't show anything unusual. Everything was later in July reviewed by a separate cardiologist, who has done some further EKGs, ultrasounds, did an ankle brachial index and confirmed that everything was regular, it was just the ectopic atrial tachycardia

  
My issue now however is that I have phases of really notable palpitations, where I feel several very hard beats daily that just take me out. I had one skipped beat sensation with a very hard beat afterwards in July that had me pass out for a split second, I get very hard beats during physical exercise from time to time and just yesterday I had a really hard beat that forced me to stop mid sentence during talking. I get around 3-4 beats of this kind everyday for a few days to a few weeks, then things go ""normal"" again. A sensation of something in my throat or a strange stiffness in my neck comes with this

  
I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't take drugs, I do a lot of sports, eat healthy, have normal blood results, BP of around 125/70, BPM of 60, no history of heart issues in my family. Am 6'4 and around 180-190 pounds. I have a small coffee once per day, that's all the stimulants I take. I am very worried that there's something seriously wrong with my heart, but all my tests were clean, I had around 10-15 EKGs done over the last year of which the only notable thing is a QRS length of 110ms. These palpitations still scare me very much, it's very scary to just suddenly have your heart stop for a second and to then have a massively strong beat that you can feel through the body",1,1762375482.0,askCardiology,1,1.0,False

***Parish of St. Étienne, Atchafalaya Marshes, Louisiana***

***May 3rd, 1822***

The riverboat lifted from the marsh as though the bayou itself had laboured to give it form.

Steam hung in threads between the cypress trunks, and the bell tolled twice, a tired summons through the heat. Her hull showed blistered patches where sun and time had stripped the paint, but she kept her dignity, proud as an old matron on Sunday. Ropes struck the post with a thud, and the smell of pitch and river mud drifted across the landing.

From beneath the awning stepped a young woman bearing a satchel at her hip and a bonnet clasped between her palms. One of the crew sprang to the shore and raised his arm toward her. She accepted his help and came down light as a heron stepping atop a log. Her gown was simple, her shoes unscuffed.

“Merci, monsieur.”

The sailor’s laugh broke through the humid air. He bounded back aboard, near tripping on the gangplank in his haste.

I removed my hat and greeted her. “Miss, I’d be pleased to welcome you to St. Étienne Parish.”

She curtsied in greeting. “You are kind, sir. My name is Claire Duval.”

“Marchand,” I replied. “Walter. I serve on the school board. The parish has arranged for you to stay with our families until we can see a house set aside. I hope that is to your liking.”

She turned toward the levee road where the church spire caught the dusk light and the bay shimmered beyond the cane. “It is, monsieur Marchand. Though I must ask a small favor, if I may.”

“Name it.”

“My case and my school books weigh as much as a trunk of bricks. Would you lend me your strength for a moment?”

I smiled. “There are heavier loads in this parish than education, Miss Duval. I’ll see to it. My boy can lend his hand too.”

Thomas waited by the cart, clutching the new copybook I’d bought him from Claude’s store. Claire looked toward him with interest. “And who is this young gentleman?”

“My son,” I said. “Thomas.”

She lowered herself to meet him. “Will you be one of my scholars, monsieur Thomas?”

“Yes, ma’am,” he said. “I can read most of my letters, but they like to run when I hurry.”

Her laughter carried like light over the fields. “Then we shall teach them manners.”

We packed her satchel and a box of spellers into the wagon and set off. The mule’s hooves struck the road in slow rhythm, the wheels cutting deep through the clay. On either side, the marsh spread wide, humming with life unseen. Cypress knees broke the water like eager knuckles reaching for air.

By the time our chimney came into view, the windows already burned with kitchen light. Abigail was setting the table when we entered, corn pone and red beans laid ready. The air carried pepper and smoke, the scent of home.

She dusted her apron and came forward. Her smile had not changed since the day she took my name. “This must be the new teacher.”

“Miss Duval,” I said. “She’ll stay with us this week. Claire, my wife, Abigail.”

Claire dipped her head. “You honor me, madame.”

Abigail met her with a kiss to each cheek. “We’re glad to have you. Our last schoolmaster could barely spell his own name. You’ll be a mercy to the children.”

Claire laughed. “Then I pray to redeem the trade, Madame Marchand… Oh, my, forgive me, Mrs. Marchand. My tongue is still stubbornly French.”

We ate together like kin, not hosts and guest. Talk turned to the river, the heat, and the children who’d be hers come Monday.

***May 6th, 1822***

The noon sun beat down hard enough to bend a man’s will. 

I stood along the fencerow with a few of the parish hands where the marsh thinned into cane. We leaned against the rails and let the heat do its work. The talk ran through weather, a skiff lost near the bend, and a sow that had farrowed in the night.

Baptiste propped his arm on the post and cut me a grin. “That new schoolteacher you’re keeping, she’s a sight worth seeing. A proper French lady, like something stepped out of a painting.”

“Mind your tongue, Baptiste,” I said. “Your Mary wouldn’t take kindly to that.”

He smirked. “Mary knows a man can look without wandering. I’ve got good eyes, not bad intent.”

Old Carter dragged his wrist across his brow. “Ain’t sin to admire what God made fair. Same Lord made the mire, made the muck. Not like any of us mean to chase her. Least not yet.”

I rested my arms on the rail and tipped my hat back. “We ought to thank Him for giving us wives. They keep us from thinking about the mud’s gold.””

Baptiste gave a bark of laughter. “Hear him, boys. Preacher Marchand’s at it again. Someone fetch the man a collar.”

Just then, Father Lemaire came striding down the fenceline. His cassock clung to him and his face shone from the heat, though his expression carried amusement enough for two men. “Would you believe attendance near doubled since Sunday? Another few days and I’ll be begging benches from the courthouse.”

Carter gave a whistle. “Guess the Word travels faster when it’s got a pretty mouth to carry it.”

The priest’s cheer faded, but he steadied himself. “Best you speak with respect, Carter. That woman serves as if God Himself set her to the task. You’d do well to pray she stays.”

I pushed from the fence and straightened. “If she’s filling the pews, then I'll call it His hand at work. Maybe she’ll even keep Baptiste awake through a whole sermon.”

That earned a round of laughter, Father Lemaire included. He raised a hand in farewell and went on toward the churchyard, humming some half-remembered tune.

By the time dusk took the fields, a cooler wind had found its way through the cane. I came in from the porch and found Abigail and Miss Duval at the kitchen table, a pot of coffee between them. They sat close, their talk a tangle of French and English, their giggling breaking through both tongues like creekwater over river rock. 

Thomas knelt by the hearth, tracing lines beneath the printed letters of his primer and sounding out each one to himself.

Abigail looked up when I entered. “You should’ve seen her at the schoolhouse today. Twenty children all reading together. I never thought I’d live to witness such peace.”

“I heard about it already,” I said, hanging my coat by the door. “Seems she’s got half the parish under her charm.”

Claire met my gaze with a hint of mirth. “Not a charm, monsieur Marchand. A promise. I told them if they finished their work, I’d tell them a story.”

“What story earns such devotion?”

“One from my mother,” she said. “It tells of a white heron who wished to marry the moonlight, though the clouds stood in the way. The bird learns too late that beauty can drown as easy as it can fly. It ends badly for the bird, I’m afraid.”

I filled a cup from the pot and joined them. “That sounds like a fine tale. Birds and men both lose their way chasing what shouldn’t be caught.”

***May 10th, 1822***

Word of Miss Duval’s arrival carried faster than prudence could catch it.

By Sunday, half the parish came to service scrubbed clean and buttoned as if heaven might inspect their seams. The men wore coats free of field dust; the women tied their ribbons tight enough to rival pride itself. When the benediction closed, the pews emptied like a tide rolling toward gossip.

Outside, the air beneath the live oaks smelled of starch and clove. Pigeons strutted between the roots, pecking crumbs from choir sheets dropped by the children. The men loosened their collars, pretending to speak of crops, though every one of them waited for the other to begin the true liturgy.

“That was a sermon worth keeping one’s eyes open for,” came a man’s remark behind me.

A woman answered, hushed and sharp as a nettle’s sting. “Didn’t know a schoolmistress could sing like that and still claim to be proper enough to teach children.”

Abigail turned to face them, dress tied neat, chin set. “She teaches more decency than I’ve heard from this circle all year.”

That cooled the air. Baptiste coughed into his sleeve, hoping to mend it. “No harm meant, Misses Abigail. Mary’s just saying the new teacher’s finer company than the choirmaster’s mistress, God rest her soul.”

Before the tension could settle, Claire crossed the churchyard toward us. 

Sunlight touched the hem of her dress as if following her step. She carried herself like a swan that had laid claim to a lake. “Madame Baptiste, perhaps my songs trouble you because you read from me and not your hymnal.”

Mary Baptiste’s color deepened. She traced a line down her throat and dropped her gaze to the ground.

Mrs. Landry’s mouth pinched. “She’s too forward,” she muttered, meaning all of us to hear.

Beside her, Mrs. Theriot leaned close to deliver her venom. “And too tempting. That French tongue of hers could turn a sermon into a dance. It belongs on a stage.”

Another woman, jeweled at the wrist, gave a scoff. “Or a boudoir.”

The words struck like wasp stings. I felt heat climb through me, but before I could speak, Abigail raised her arm and cut the talk short. “Enough,” she said. “There are children at your skirts.”

The jeweled woman lifted her chin. “We know of the children,” she replied. “We only worry who fills their heads.""

Claire did not answer. She stepped past them and joined Thomas, who had been chasing a pigeon near the fence. The bird scattered into the oak limbs and her smile followed it upward.

***May 12th, 1822***

After supper was cleared and the china dried, Miss Duval took her seat near the parlor window and began to sing. 

The words carried a tongue not mine to understand, yet sorrow has a language of its own. The song rose through the rafters and lingered across the room until even the fire seemed to listen. Our old hound thumped his tail once against the rug, sighed, and went slack again. 

When the last note faded, Abigail brushed her cheek as if swatting a stray gnat and fussed at the tablecloth to hide her tears. The smell of rain drifted faintly through the cracks of the home.

Claire turned toward us, color high along her throat, uneasy in her kindness. “Forgive me,” she said. “It is a foolish song from my mother’s house.”

“There’s no foolishness in grace,” I told her. “If the Lord heard that tune, He might have claimed it for Himself.”

Her lips curved, uncertain whether to take it as jest or truth. I turned down the lamp and wished them both good rest.

By midnight, thunder rolled down from the hills and struck the house with a sound like shifting timbers on a boat. I woke, swung my legs from the bed, and went to fasten the shutters before they tore loose.

When I pulled open the front door, the smell of wet clay and cypress rose to meet me. Lightning flashed across the yard, catching her in its white flare. She stood near the cistern, gown clinging to her, hair slick across her face, her arms lifted as if counting every drop that fell.

“You’ll catch death out there,” I said from the porch rail.

She turned toward me, her trance breaking into surprise. “Forgive me, Monsieur Marchand. I have missed the smell of honest rain.”

“You could have smelled it from under a roof,” I said. “Ain’t sense standing beneath Heaven’s bucket.”

Her laugh was brief, chased by a shiver. “In New Orleans, the rain burns with smoke. Here, it tastes like something still living.”

I stepped down, boards washing under my heels. “Living or not, it’ll have you fevered if you stay in it.”

Before she answered, a light came from behind me. “Walter,” Abigail called, her tone weary but clear, “who are you talking to this time of night?” She stepped into the doorway, robe drawn close, braid falling loose down her chest.

“It seems Miss Duval fancied a walk,” I said. “She must’ve wanted to sing harmony with the thunder.”

Claire lowered her regard. “Forgive me, Madame. I know it was foolish, but I have dreamed of rain for months and could not resist greeting it.”

Abigail sighed and stepped down beside me, the hem of her robe catching the wet boards. “The rain will still be here come morning,” she said. “Next time, take a shawl if you need to hear Heaven argue with itself.”

Claire smiled and wiped the water from her face. “I’ll take your scolding, Mrs. Marchand, and your towel if you’ll lend it.”

Inside, she sat by the hearth while the flames drew steam from her gown in soft curls. Abigail fetched an old quilt from the cedar chest and wrapped it around her, muttering as she tucked the corners in place. “City women forget what the sky can do,” she said.

Claire studied the fire, her features caught half in its light. “Perhaps I have.”

Outside, the rain hissed through the rafters, steady and full as breath. When she rose to leave, the clock marked an hour past one. She thanked Abigail and wished us peace, then vanished down the hall like a spirit.

***May 15th, 1822***

By Friday evening, her trunks stood beside the door and the little crate of spellers waited atop them. 

Thomas stood on the steps, arms crossed in the same stubborn fashion he learned from his mother. “Will you write me something before you go?” 

She smiled and slid his copybook from under his elbow. The pen touched the page: *Write with your heart, not only with your hand, and you shall read the world itself.*

He sounded it out, then wrapped her round the waist. She bent and kissed his crown with the care only a woman carries. 

Abigail came from the kitchen and brushed her apron with both palms. “You’ve gone and spoiled us these few days. But if you must run off, the Boudreaux had better treat you like kin, or I’ll raise a racket on every porch in St. Étienne.” 

Claire let a little air pass her lips and smiled. “If they feed me near as well as you, Madame Marchand, I’ll grow too content to wander far.”

We carried her bag to the cart and set it behind the seat. From the ditch came a chorus of night things, not only crickets but tree toads and the rasp of a marsh hen hidden in canes. Water tapped the culvert stones, and a damp sweetness rose from milkweed and bay laurel.

At the road, I gave my arm. She climbed into the wagon and sat straight beside me with her bonnet settled in her lap. For a stretch we let the wheels speak to the ruts and the ruts answer back.

“You’ve a fine house, monsieur Marchand,” she said at last. “A loyal wife, a bright son. Not every man counts so many blessings.”

“I reckon I’ve been favored,” I told her. “You’ll meet the same grace all across this parish. Our folk aim toward decent.”

She kept her attention on the ribbon the moon laid over the flooded flats. “Decent,” she said, and the word carried a little prayer. “I hope that proves true.”

A lone rider came on and lifted his hat. He near lost the saddle keeping his attention where it didn’t belong. Claire kept her eyes to the fields. 

“Mr. Marchand,” she said, “I’ve been meaning to tell you a thing, though I can’t name the reason. It was a dream, I think, yet it clings. May I trouble you with what ought to stay unsaid?”

“You may.”

She gathered the bonnet ribbon and let it slacken again. “A few nights ago I dreamed a storm would rise darker than the last. I stood in the swamp with water to my hips.

“I heard something move behind me, near enough that the ripples touched my legs. When I turned, a face waited below the surface. Clear as day. 

“It was mine.

“But the face had swelled. The skin had gone gray and soft, and the mouth looked sorrowful, so much that I thought my heart would fail from pity. Still, I felt as if I’d been waiting for myself to find me.

“Then the world changed. I was the one in the water looking up. The drowned one was me.

“I saw my other self standing above the mire. Alive. Dry. Whole. And she was smiling. That living self turned and left me in the water. There was nothing left for me to do but drift away.”

“Dreams play cruel tricks, Miss Duval,” I said. “The storm must have set your thoughts to roaming.”

She gave a worn smile. “Maybe so. Yet it felt less like trickery and more like remembering something that has not yet come to pass.”

At the Boudreaux gate she asked me to thank Abigail again. I gave my word.

She stepped down, lifted her hem from the mud, and went along the oak walk. Their house lamp drew her in; for the span of a heartbeat she seemed half made of mist and moon.

 **June 23rd, 1822**

The sky had been tearing itself open all week.

Storms rolled up from the Gulf, stacked black upon black like wet lumber and carrying thunder that shook the homes. The school lasted only a day before the roads sank under brown water, and the children could not reach the porch without sinking near to the ankle.

Claire pinned a notice to the chapel door: *Lessons to resume when the Lord returns His light.* Before the ink had dried, the rain had blurred the words to ghosts.

That afternoon I rode out to see if the church roof would bear another beating. The cypress leaned over the gallery and dragged their moss along the steps like old brooms. Beneath the awning stood Claire, Mrs. Landry, the Theriot sisters, and the young Mrs. Boudreaux. Their skirts clung to them, their talk drowned beneath the rain’s endless hiss.

I tipped my hat. “Ma’am. Ladies.”

Miss Duval turned toward me and gave the neat curtsy I had come to expect. “Monsieur Marchand. We’re taking food and linens to a sick child near the bayou road.”

Mrs. Landry spoke up. “We shall not be long.”

“If you must go, take the high levee. The plank roads are drowning.” 

One of the Theriot girls gave a scoff. “We know our way, sir. Don’t fret us like hens.”

Claire tied her bonnet beneath her chin. “We’ll mind the path, monsieur. Thank you.”

I thought to offer my cart, but I’d promised Claude I’d see to his supplies before dark. When I came back through, the porch stood empty, the rain sweeping away all trace of them.

By dusk, Baptiste was at my gate, bare-headed and streaked with mud. He near fell against the post. “Walter,” he said, “come quick. Claire’s not returned, and there’s something at the marsh edge you ought to see.”

Abigail started to speak, then read my face. She went to the kitchen, fetched the lantern, and pressed it into my hand. Baptiste and I followed the plank road until it vanished under water. Two men waited there, their coats slick and heavy, the lantern light crawling down them like oil. 

In the mud we found four or five sets of tracks headed toward the cypress stand, then nothing. Just black water swallowing the trail.

“I reckon she went toward the old tree,” Baptiste said. “After that the marsh took her steps.”

The water deepened as we moved on. We came to a stump rising from the shallows like a drowned finger. Its roots glistened under the lamp light, slick and dark. On one of them lay a stain the rain had not yet claimed.

I lifted the light higher. The mark was brown at the edge like rust. A torn ribbon hung from a reed nearby. I leaned closer, and the flame shook.

There in the weeds lay a bonnet, water-worn and torn as if dragged through gravel. Along the inner band a red line had dried in the stitching. I lifted the edge between two twigs. A clump of dark hair caught on the thread.

Baptiste stepped back. “Good Lord. We should fetch Father.”

“I think we should fetch the women,” I said.

We took the bonnet to the church first. Father Lemaire stood in the nave with a prayer book open, rain hammering the shingles above. He crossed himself and offered a blessing over the find.

Afterward we rode out to question those who had walked with her. Mrs. Landry and the Theriot sisters stood at their doors, skirts still damp. Each swore Claire had gone with them as far as the plank road before the floods parted them. Each said Miss Duval turned her own way and called back not to fret.

When I held out the bonnet, they recoiled as if it were a snake laying in the reeds.

“I can’t say,” Mrs. Landry told me. “We lost her after leaving the child’s house. She said she’d follow. I thought she had.”

“Did you see her fall into the basin?” I asked.

“I did not. I am not that woman’s keeper.”

We went back out with the lanterns and called her name until our throats went raw. The marsh answered only with the rasp of frogs and the sucking draw of the water.

By the time the sun showed its first color, we turned home with nothing to bring. By morning the parish had already written its stories.

Some said she ran off with a lover. Some said she missed her step and drowned. Others swore she’d lost her way and would return once the flood broke.

I wrote the sheriff in St. Martinville to send men and boats to drag the bayou. Yet even as I sealed the letter, I knew.

The marsh keeps its dead with a jealous heart.

***July 5th, 1822***

A week has passed since we laid her name among the dead.

The sheriff’s men dragged their skiffs through the bayou three days ago, nets rising heavy only with weed and driftwood. Two nights past, the whole parish filled the chapel, rosaries clicking, wax running down their knuckles, as they prayed her soul toward rest.

This morning, walking beside the mule cart along the shell road, I saw her.

She came along the rise as if she had only stepped away for an errand. The dress she wore was white as egret wings, the cloth shining as though no storm had dared touch it. Sunlight gathered around her in a manner I cannot explain, glazing her skin though she moved beneath the broad shade of a straw hat.

The reins slid from my hand. “Miss Duval?”

She turned, smiling as though our last words had been spoken an hour ago. “Monsieur Marchand, is all well? You look as though you’ve met a spirit.”

“Most in St. Étienne would name you one,” I said. “We blessed a cloth and buried it in your place.”

“Then you’d best dig it up,” she answered with a laugh that seemed to warm the road. “The storm lost me in its folds, that’s all. I found a fisherman’s hut, stayed until the rain tired itself out. They fed me, lent me a cot, and sent me on my way once the mud turned back to road. I'm sure the ladies of this town would have no qualms with that testimony.”

Her tale was clean enough that I could find no crack to question. She stepped close until the brim of her hat cast its shade across my sleeve.

“You are kind to stop,” she said. “Would you walk with me back to town? I have grown uneasy walking this road alone.”

I led the mule by its bridle, and we set out side by side. Steam rose from the road, and the smell of wet vines hung heavy over the fields. Her skirt brushed through the weeds without stain. No mud found her shoes, though my boots sank near to the ankle.

When we came within sight of town, the very rhythm of the day shifted. Men rose from their chairs. Children dropped their toys. Women on the porches went still, hands pausing mid-motion. Even the wind in the cane gave out, leaving only the hum of the river beyond.

Mrs. Landry found her courage first. “Lord have mercy. It’s her.”

“Mr. Marchand, I fear I’ve made quite a frightful commotion.”

We reached the schoolhouse. She paused at the steps and turned to me. “I will open the lessons again tomorrow,” she said. “Tell Thomas he mustn’t skip class.”

“He’s prayed for you every night,” I said. “He’ll near burst when he sees you.”

Her smile shifted, tender and heavy with thought. “Then perhaps his prayers were heard, though Heaven sometimes grants what it should not.”

**July 12th, 1822**

Since the morning I met her on the road, Miss Duval has returned to the schoolhouse without another word of where she had gone.

At the first ring she stands near the schoolhouse and greets each child by name. She bends to speak to each of them, her manner so kind that each child believes themselves her favorite.

When lessons end, the youngest linger. They crowd close to her hem as if afraid to lose her. Even when the mothers call, some stay until the mothers fetch them away. Some must be carried home crying. I heard one of the mothers hiss the word *witch* under her breath, though I could not tell whose mouth it came from.

At noon I rode down the lane and saw her across the rails speaking with Mr. Theriot and two others from the mill. Her white gloves caught the sun when she lifted them, tracing shapes in the air as if she drew some thought invisible to the rest of us.

Mr. Theriot bent in, his tone turned slick. “Ma’am, if you find your lodging less than kind, my house is never locked to you. You’d be treated finer there.”

“You are gracious, monsieur,” she said. “But a teacher cannot rest in every bed at once. You will have to wait your turn.” She turned her gaze upon the three of them. “Though perhaps I should keep a list. Which of you wants to be first?”

The men broke into laughter, red-faced and foolish. She did not join them, nor did she blush. She met each of their faces in turn until their laughter fell away. Something in the air between them turned wrong, and I felt it even from the road.

By dawn the next day, talk ran from porch to porch faster than dogs could carry it. 

The younger Theriot girl had fainted in the middle of her violin lesson and been carried home near white as linen. Old Boudreaux found three of his cattle dead in the pen, bellies split, blood dark in the grass as though poured from a pail. At the Landry house, their infant burned hot with fever that no rag could cool.

Baptiste came to my fence that afternoon, sweat dark on his collar. “Mary’s taken to her bed,” he said. “Head spinning, gums bleeding like she’d chewed glass. She don’t look long for this world.”

“Send for Father Lemaire,” I told him. “He’s seen worse than a fever.”

Baptiste rubbed the back of his neck and glanced toward the distant rows. “Can’t,” he said. “Father’s off blessing the Boudreaux land after that cattle mess. Miss Duval went with him, said she’d sing a hymn for the dead stock.”

I turned toward the far edge of town. Between the rows something moved. Her gown caught what little light the day still held and shone against the black cane. The wind drew through the stalks, and the cloth lifted, billowing like a sail on dark seas.

**July 26th, 1822**

I saw her again tonight along the road from the Boudreaux place. She carried no lantern and wore no bonnet, her shape narrow against the dark like a stalk left standing after harvest.

“Miss Duval,” I called. “You walk late.”

She paused by the ditch. “The nights are kind to me.”

“Kind or not, folk have begun to talk,” I told her. “They say you brought a sickness back from that storm. Is there truth in it?”

She let the question hang, then came a step nearer. “Men grow weak. Cattle die. Infants burn with fever. Is that new, monsieur Marchand? Tell me, has this parish ever needed me to bring such things?”

“No,” I said. “But they still say it.”

The sound of her tread vanished into the wet road. She came close enough for the scent of her to reach me, sweet and bitter, like lavender crushed in a mortar. “And what do you say?”

“I keep my thoughts to myself.”

Her chest rose once, a faint stir of breath. She turned her gaze to the black water. The faint glow of the sunset clung to her eyes, and the light held there after the sun was gone, as though it had found no better place to rest.

**August 1st, 1822**

Our turn has come again. 

She appeared at the gate during that hour when the marsh turns violet and the last light drains from the grass. In one hand she carried her small valise, in the other a bundle of canebrake lilies bound with twine. I stood still among the cypress shadows, caught by the sight of her.

Something in her had altered. Her skin held the color of candle wax, and her gaze caught the starlight as if it belonged to her.

Abigail came down the walk and called out in her warm way. “Welcome back, Miss Duval. Come in from that dark before it takes you whole.”

Claire dipped her head in thanks. “You honor me, Mrs. Marchand.”

They greeted as women do, all grace and affection. Inside, the table was laid, though she touched none of what was offered. She lifted her cup once, brought it near her lips, then set it aside as if the thought of tasting had passed her by.

When supper was cleared and the lamps trimmed low, Abigail went to our room. I meant to follow, yet Claire reached across the table and brushed my wrist with her fingertips.

“Stay,” she said. “Just a while longer.”

Her touch carried the chill of shaded current. She rose and stepped to the porch, the skirt of her dress gliding over the boards. I followed her into the dusk. The yard lay still as a painted scene.

“Walter,” she said, “you were the first in this parish to offer me shelter. You keep your house steady. You honor your wife. You keep faith with God. Do you know how rare that is?”

“I know my vows, Miss Claire.”

She turned then. The light from the lamp caught her face, though no flame should have reached so far. “Most men know their vows as one knows a hill at distance,” she said. “They point toward it. They never climb.” Her tone softened to something almost pleading. “If I asked you to call me beautiful, would you?”

“You know you are,” I said, hearing my own folly in the words. “You need no man to tell you that.”

“Then say I am wanted,” she said. “Say I am needed. Say that if I asked you to walk with me into the dark, you would not refuse.”

The stillness between us pressed close. I felt the pull of my wedding band, as if the gold itself remembered its oath.

“No,” I said. “I will not say that. Forgive me, Miss Duval.”

She bowed her head and gave one short laugh, not of scorn but of sorrow. It sounded like a fish turning deep beneath a blackened pond.

“You are the only one,” she said. “Do you hear me? The only one. Before and after the storm, you alone did not disgrace me, nor mock, nor touch me.” She drew in air that trembled against the night. “Listen to me, monsieur Marchand, and obey me. Forbid me from your threshold. In the name of your house and the God who keeps it. Speak and bind me to it.”

“Why would you ask such a thing?”

She raised her face, and the flame inside the house bent toward her. “Say it, Walter Marchand. Bar me from this home forever.”

My throat tightened, yet no dread found me, only pity. The kind one feels for a creature that has wounded itself. I stepped to the sill and pressed my palm against the jamb.

“Miss Duval,” I said, “by my duty as husband and master of this house, I forbid you entry now and always. This door is closed to you until the Lord Himself declares it open.”

Her features changed. The glow left her face, and her body swayed as if struck. She caught the porch post for balance, a sound breaking from her throat like an animal struggling in pain.

“Thank you,” she said. Her gaze brightened, carrying a glimmer too fierce for peace. “You do not know what you have spared me.”

I reached toward her, but she slipped away. Her skin seemed to burn where the lamplight touched it. 

Turning from the porch, she crossed the yard without looking back. At the fence she lingered, a pale figure against the stars. Then she fled into the cane, her gown flashing once in the dark before the field swallowed her whole.

**August 2nd, 1822**

Mist climbed from the ditches and spread over the cane until the fields heaved like a drowned sea. No insect sang. No bullfrog kept watch. No owl marked the hour. Even the wind forgot its work, and the roof timbers held their yawns.

Then came the cries. One voice first, thin and far, then another breaking over it. They rose from the lower road, raw and pleading. I stepped onto the porch, thinking of barns and robberies, but the night carried something worse. 

A scent reached me through the fog, thick and ironed, and I knew it for what it was. Blood rode the damp.

Abigail called from the hall. “Walter, what’s happening?”

“Inside,” I said. “Bar the back door.”

I heard the scrape of the bolt and her steps crossing the floorboards.

Down toward the levee, a scatter of lights moved. Lanterns swung madly through the fog. The glows pitched and swung as the men ran, their shouts splitting into screams. I lifted the rifle from its pegs and crossed the yard though my knees shivered under me.

At first I thought drink or quarrel had turned a house wicked. Then the mist opened, and I saw what walked the road.

Claire came climbing the slope barefoot, her gown torn to threads that clung to her body like the plumage of a wounded bird. Moonlight caught the torn cloth, and the color of it shifted between milk and scarlet. Where her skin showed, it gleamed like bleached marrow; where blood marked her, she burned crimson.

In her arms she carried a small round thing that swung loose, its weight cradled as a babe. A head lolled toward her breast. She let it fall. It struck the dust and rolled once before coming still. Its vacant gaze found mine.

Baptiste.

His neck was opened past the spine. The rest of him lay somewhere among the reeds.

All around her the earth glimmered with ruin. The Theriot sisters. Boudreaux’s wife. Their shapes lay scattered like broken dolls, the necks ripped through in the same red terror. The grass shone dark where the life had poured out of them.

She lifted her arms, wet to the elbow, and dragged the blood across her chest. One leg lifted and curled as if she meant to begin a dance.

Then she turned her face to the moon and loosed a laugh so deep it rattled the trees. Her teeth caught the light, long, white, and terrible.

A door flew open down the lane. Mr. Theriot burst into the road with a lantern in one hand and a pistol in the other. “Miss Duval!” he shouted. “What have you done?”

She turned with the ease of a cat after sleep. “You called me pretty once, did you not, monsieur?”

He raised the pistol, wrist trembling. “Come no closer.”

“You soured when I told you your desires had no home with me. You threatened to turn me into a wanderer for denying you what you wanted.” The hammer had not fallen before she crossed the space.

One breath she stood twenty paces off; the next she was upon him, her arm buried through the cloth of his shirt. The lantern threw a wild circle as blood leapt across her face and forearms. She drew back. He dropped without a cry. His breastbone split like a roasted bird, his insides laid open as if for a butcher’s table.

She bent over him, and the sound that rose was hoggish and wet. When she stood again, her mouth was tar-dark, her chin laced in thick red strands. She tipped her head and loosed a cry, half hymn and half mewling. Dogs from one end of the parish to the other answered as if they had been waiting for her command.

The Landry house caught fire next. I do not know if she lit it or if some lamp fell in the panic, but shingles flared and fire ran the row like spilled liquor. Flames took to the cane and pushed a red tide toward us.

Abigail reached the door. “Walter, please, come away.”

“Take Thomas,” I said. “Get to the root cellar. Bar it and do not lift that bar till I call.”

She studied my face, gathered the boy, and vanished.

The wind swung, and the blaze cast full light across the yard. In that red wash I saw her clearer than any noon. She walked with hair unbound, arms spread to the fire as if to greet a congregation. Her face held the color of alabaster, yet the veins beneath ran ink-black. 

At her feet the dead had begun to mound. She tore at them. Flesh came away in ropes. When one body gave no more, she scored the ribs with her nails, pressed her mouth to the open hollow, and drank from every cut. Steam climbed from the blood where it met her cold skin.

The sound of it, the working of her throat, was worse than any scream. She fed until her belly swelled. She lifted her face and spoke to no one we could see. “Do you see me now, Étienne? Do you see what your jealous hearts have bred?”

The fire answered by rushing the cane in waves, crackling like clapped hands.

From the smoke she walked to the Landry gate, where the matron stood shaking. Mrs. Landry tried to speak; nothing came.

Claire closed the distance until they stood near enough to share the same breath.

“I prayed for your soul,” Mrs. Landry forced out. “Have mercy.”

“Before,” Claire said, “or after you led me astray? You and the envious mouths of Étienne pray only for yourselves. If you longed for my return, let your prayer be answered.”

She took the woman by the chin and kissed her full on the mouth. They held like lovers caught in secret. Then Mrs. Landry went rigid, her arms clawing at empty air. The kiss deepened; I saw Claire’s throat work as she drew the life straight out of the other’s chest.

When she let the body fall, the tongue showed black rot, the skin turned to death, the sockets sunken and empty. Claire’s lips burned scarlet. When she smiled, two thin threads of blood hung from her teeth like ribbons. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.

Then she set her gaze toward my house. What met me was not woman and not beast. It was famine that had forgotten its mind.

I pulled back inside and took the window post for cover. “Dear God,” I said. “Deliver us from this evil.”

She crossed the yard by slow steps. Each footfall left no mark, nor sound.

She halted at the fence and laid both palms to the rails. Her nails had gone black and thin as knives. “Walter,” she called, the sound near breaking, “I’m cold. Let me in. Only a little while. I am tired and I need your help.”

I set the barrel of the rifle against the sill. “You’re not Miss Claire. Whatever you are, go back to the water that birthed you.”

She pressed her palms on the gate until the wood groaned. “Walter, my feet bleed. My throat burns. You would not leave a woman to die at your door, would you?”

“Leave, devil. You are not welcome here.”

A cry came like a maiden who had lost her suitor. No good thing makes that sound. It rose and fell, cracked and gurgled, like a swine under the knife. Her frame shook. She bent double, weeping until blood ran down her chin in streaming threads.

“Go,” I said. “I barred you from this house. By my order, and yours, you are not allowed on this land.”

The fire threw her shadow high along the trees. For a heartbeat it seemed there were two of her. She turned from us and walked toward the burning fields, her body gleaming red as she passed into the haze. She was taken by the marsh.

I fixed the shutters and dropped to my knees. The Lord may wipe this sight from His memory. I cannot.

***September 10th, 1823***

A year has passed since the night the Lord hid His face from St. Étienne. 

My house still stands, yet the fields give stingy harvest, and the laughter that once filled our board breaks now in scraps.

Along the levee the road runs bare. Ten chimneys once breathed there; only mine still smokes. Fire bred a lush green in its wake of ashes, and the ground keeps no trace of doors or gardens. Soil pulled a veil over its shame.

Most evenings I sit the porch and keep watch on the flats. At times a strange light drifts over that sheet of mud and water. It moves like a lantern borne by no man. Once, I swear I saw her among that wandering glow.

She stood where the water thins to a mirror. Her gown shone white once more, free of stain. The wind drew across her hair, and it gleamed like moonlight off the back of an eel.

The river men have given her a new name: *La Mariée du Marais.* 

At the dock, Old René told it this way:

“*I met her where the plank road drowns. Orbs of marsh-light rose round her like a bridal train. Lift and fall, lift and fall. Her hem skimmed the skin of the bayou right along my skiff as her feet caressed the water. She vanished without a word.*” 

They say she waits on oath-breakers and on those with barbed tongues. She sings from the shallows with a sweetness that could pass for a prayer, and any soul who answers does not greet the morning. They are found leached of color, chalk-cold, the chest emptied of their hearts.

'Dock talk,' some call it. Let them. I have seen what they have not.

The world feeds its devils and leaves its saints to starve.

She has always been quite the ""lone wolf"" type. Dislikes meeting new people, does not want to be around others and even with me she has quite clear boundaries; nonetheless she has been quite loving and serious about the relationship.

Now she says to me that she is feeling quite desperate because she has no alone time. She is barely alone in the house because I am mostly here.

She tells me that she does not feel like the house is hers. That she likes missing me and that a couple of hours without me in the house is not enough.

I feel like perhaps her take on solitude is not that compatible with me, much more understanding the kind of job and lifestyle I have.

1. Today officially marks 90 days since I began carnivore. Let me tell when I say it has been one exciting roller coaster. Prior to carnivore, I had tried COUNTLESS diets such as keto and intermittent fasting but nothing seemed to work. I always felt like garbage and was ALWAYS HUNGRY. That was until I learned of carnivore. I had just hit 300 pounds on the scale, had chest pains, shortness of breath, terrible acne, and always out of breath. This is when I knew I need to make a change. So while doom scrolling on instagram I came across Dr. Ken Berry and I said, “Got nothing to lose from trying it, give it a real chance.” That’s when I got to work. The first week was very difficult. Ketosis hit me like a truck but I climbed out of it around day 6. I had also experienced some heart palpitations during the first 2ish weeks whenever I would do anything physically exerting such as pickleball or mowing the lawn. I primarily ate ground beef, eggs, and the luxurious Kerrygold Salted Butter. I counted calories for the first couple weeks but eventually learned that for me it was unnecessary and eventually stopped

2. Up to this point, I have lost 50 pounds, went from a 40/32 back down to a 36/32, and can confidently wear XL again! Something else to note is how much my acne has cleared and when I say cleared I mean completely gone! Most days consist of 73/27 ground beef patties with sharp cheddar cheese. Favorite snacking cheese is Asiago. I eat lots of bacon and chicken as well. Now I will say, there are some things that I do that others may not approve. This includes Seasonings and Diet Soda. For me, seasonings don’t make me flare and haven’t affected anything and as long as I don’t drink more than 2 diet cokes a day, this train rolls with no stops. I also mass consume coffee because unfortunately I am heavily reliant on caffeine but I do also drink at least a gallon of water a day. Something else that I did that may not be approved is having a cheat weekend for bachelor trip. But after cheating and feeling like utter garbage, I was very excited to start back and have been tolling smooth ever since. 

3. I cannot express enough how much this diet has changed my life. I’m a completely different person than I was just a mere 3 months ago. I encourage that whoever may read this takes the leap of faith and trust the process. The first week is hard but if you stay true and put your all to it you will be amazed by what just eating only meat can do. I hope my story will inspire others to make the change. Just know I BELIEVE IN YOU and that someday your leap of faith will positively change your life!",27,1762375231.0,carnivorediet,3,0.97,False

I’m not too concerned about the quality of espresso — I love coffee in an amateur way, and I am mainly enticed by the all-in-one nature of this machine (as someone whole loves espresso/drip/iced coffee). 


I’ve seen some people talk about mechanical issues — this is the area I’m most concerned about. 

• Do people find that the machine works as promised, if you properly follow the instructions? 

• Are there issues immediately or do they happen after a while? 

• Are the issues permanent or is there a fix (I.e. replacement parts, troubleshooting solutions)? 

• is it worth it? Do you like the machine?

Above are some of the questions on my mind, but I’d love to hear whatever else people want to share about their experiences and thoughts on the machine as a whole. If it helps at all, I’m in Canada — I believe the machines don’t vary a lot country to country, but there do seem to be some differences with North America vs European machines due the different electrical needs, so I thought it’d be worth mentioning.

they then lived out the life of a immortal having a love and then losing them to a natural force that killed all around them and in ww2 was their longest surviving friend who due to a fluctuation in the physical paradox energy created a shield that saved that friend from dying in Hiroshima on a suicide mission only for the friend to later be shot dead Evan than left his multiverse to fight in a war that spanned 1000 years before a cloned soldier with a mutation that allowed emotions died he went a little crazy making a bomb for another 1000 years losing all there friends along the way the bomb destroyed almost a quintillion multiverses 

but a curse from a goddess he fought alongside made them know every life detail of every life they took after the war there memories of all the terrible things they have done along which all the new information they gained from seeing so many lives they became a artificial god that was more pacifistic and started making immortal friends who they saw as family 

after many memories and experiences with these people they sacrificed themselves blowing up gods who returned from the war manually setting the bomb off and trapping themselves in a containment field sending them to the broken realm where immortals that can escape hell and heaven go to reach a end but not Evan 

they became the god reaper a long dead deity that condemns gods after 50 years of solitude they to escape to prevent a greater threat where he seals the six gods destined to reset everything in every multiverse and rebuild it in their own image by sealing the gods they turn to stone and die again only to be rebuilt again

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1762374484.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

I was about to quit coding for good, and then it happened.","I've built furniture from IKEA with worse-than-useless instructions, I've learned a foreign language, I've even tried to understand cricket. But nothing, and I mean *nothing*, prepared me for the soul-crushing difficulty of learning to code. The last few months have felt like being dropped in the middle of the ocean with a textbook on 'How to Swim.' I was stuck in a loop of watching a tutorial, feeling like a genius, and then staring at a blank editor with a blinking cursor that was basically mocking my entire existence.

Last Tuesday was my breaking point. I was working on what should have been a simple problem. A 'beginner' problem. It had been six hours. My eyes were burning, my brain felt like a puddle of lukewarm soup, and I was fueled by nothing but stale coffee and pure spite. The code just wouldn't work. It felt like the computer was personally gaslighting me, telling me an error existed on a line that I *knew* was perfect. I was ready to slam my laptop shut and go apply for a job as a professional dog walker.

In a last-ditch effort, I deleted the entire block of code, ready to give up. But as I sat back in my chair, staring at the empty space, a thought just floated into my head. A quiet, simple little thought about the logic. It wasn't a lightning bolt, more like a tiny flicker of a candle in a dark room. I hesitantly re-typed the lines, but with one tiny, insignificant change. I hit 'run.' And it worked. The terminal spat out the exact result I wanted. 

I just stared at it. I didn't cheer or fist-pump. I just felt this wave of quiet, overwhelming relief wash over me. For the first time, I hadn't just copied a solution; my brain had actually connected the dots on its own. It finally *clicked*. I'm still miles away from being a pro, and I know a thousand more frustrating nights are ahead of me. But that one tiny victory was enough to keep me going.

So, what was your 'it finally clicked' moment when you were learning something new and ridiculously hard?",1,1762374351.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

We met up once for coffee and she seemed to really like me. But in reality, I was always to the one reaching out first and trying to meet up again. If I never reached out again, I would never hear from her again. 

The last time I asked her out, she said that she would be traveling / back home for the rest of the year, and she thanked me for asking her, but didn't suggest a follow up meeting. That would be fine and totally understandable if it was true, but I have reason to believe she was lying to get me to leave her alone because she posted on her story and was clearly still in town. The thing that hurts more is I think she FORGOT that we follow each other and I can see her stories ... and I noticed she either deleted it or blocked me from seeing them right after I saw it. I don't know how to explain how hopeless that makes me feel. It makes me feel like a fucking creepy-ass idiot for even thinking I had a chance. Like such a fucking loser. It's hopeless because it's been a pattern in my life.

It's so rare that a woman approaches me first or shows interest in me even as a friend let alone as a romantic interest. Every opportunity I had, I had to create it myself. How am I not so supposed to feel hopeless when I feel so undesirable and forgettable?",52,1762374323.0,self,35,0.81,False

I'm 34 y/o , I have an AA in an unrelated field.  
I'm currently a Regional Manager with a national coffee chain and I'm having doubts about staying after 9 years of working for them.   
Currently make around 60k/annually, promotion i'm gunning for would be double.   
   
I have had opportunities to promote that require me to move across the country, but have refused; i've had a couple of different opportunities to stay closer that got removed last second after being told for the last year I'd essentially be a shoe-in for it. For personal reasons, I'm really trying not to relocate to the other side of the country as i've already moved states for this company 2 other times. 

I haven't seriously considered leaving/switching companies/careers for a long time; i've invested a lot in this company, and I feel so close yet so far from getting an opportunity to promote that I would actually want (the cost of being picky and being a little older and wanting to settle somewhere). 

I guess the question I have is, based on my education, experience, etc, am I being stupid thinking about leaving, should I ride it out or is there a shot at finding something better?  I know the job market out there is rough, and i'm fighting the urge to leave, but i'm not sure what other options I have to make that kind of money.       ",2,1762374232.0,Careers,1,1.0,False

It could be a coincidence but that’s when i noticed it. 

My sleep has been a disaster, and i had pretty bad brain fog the first two weeks but it has lightened up. I also have been getting canker sores, which sucks. Anyone else deal with those after quitting? It could be because of increased stress from lack of sleep.

Anyway, I’m planning on sticking to it. ",7,1762374010.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

My wife (44F) and I (44M) are considering a move from Bloomington, Indiana to Columbia, MO as we expand our business (can’t share details yet). Our kids are in college, so we’re not navigating schools or childhood matters - just looking for a great community fit.


What we love about Bloomington: liberal, artsy, university-town energy; walkable neighborhoods; strong local food scene; community events; and a generally welcoming vibe. We’re hoping Columbia offers a similar feel. We’re spiritual but not religious. I’m also in long-term recovery and really value 12-step fellowship.


Professionally, I’m an LCSW and my wife is a yoga teacher, we’d love to plug into Columbia’s mental-health and wellness communities.


A few questions for locals:
	•	Which neighborhoods feel safe, walkable, and friendly for daily life (coffee, parks, short errands on foot)?
	•	How’s the gastronomy scene - locally owned restaurants, markets, coffee, and chef-driven spots? Any must-try areas?
	•	Community & culture: festivals, live music, talks/lectures, volunteer opportunities?
	•	Inclusive community spaces or groups for folks who are spiritual but not religious?
	•	Recovery: How’s the AA/NA scene (meeting variety, accessibility, welcoming culture)? Any strong recovery-friendly communities or sober events?
	•	Yoga studios with demand for teachers (especially trauma-informed, vinyasa, or restorative)?
	•	Quality-of-life: general safety, traffic/commute feel, cost of living, and anything you wish you’d known before moving.
If there’s a better sub or local forum for these questions, please point me there. Thanks in advance for any guidance, neighborhood recs, or “if you like X about Bloomington, check out Y in Columbia” tips!",5,1762373854.0,columbiamo,6,0.73,False

I am using recently roasted beans (which are stored in an airtight container), grinding right before adding to the pot, and I am using a Sözen Turkish grinder on the finest setting. I use a ratio of 1:10 coffee to water in my cezve, then stir everything together and let it sit on the stove and do not touch while it heats up on low. Most times, a thin crust forms and then it starts boiling shortly after. I have been thinking that perhaps it is because of the type of burner that I use (genuine Calrod)?

Initial Character Sheet Sketch (04)

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖General Information〗

- Name: Logan Warren
- Alias/Nickname: ""The Logos"" (OG Name), **_""The Self-Referential Principle of Being""_ (Title), Professor Logan (As his students call him)
- Age: Mid 30s (Based on appearance estimates, He is 35 years old)
- Sex: Male (apparently)
- Race: Human?

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Appearance〗

## Distinguishing Features ㅤ⌜ Scars, Marks, etc. ⌟: 
He wears glasses, because in his human body, he decided to have something that would make him more himself, so he chose to be nearsighted
## General Description: 
You could call him a pretty average man, but he has his own charm in his looks
## Height: 
1.82 m (meters)
## Weight: 
74 kg (kilograms, yes, I use the Metric System)
## Skin Tone: 
Pale with a faint warmth under certain light
## Hair: 
Dark brown with subtle chestnut-copper undertones; shoulder-length, slightly wavy
## Eyes: 
Deep amber-brown; under light, they shimmer faintly with a golden hue, as if reflecting something infinite
## Clothing: 
He's a fan of gray sweatshirts, always wears high-heel boots, and likes red polo shirts because they give him a more contemporary look

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Psychological Data〗

## Personality: 
- Core Traits: Calm, introspective, deeply articulate. He has a heightened level of understanding of abstract concepts.
- Behavior: He usually observes before speaking, and when he does, his words carry layered meanings, as if each one were weighed for centuries
- Mannerisms: He touches things as if they might disappear; books, rain, people, as He values tangibility.
- Disposition: Quietly melancholic, but not sad; more like someone mourning infinity while learning to love moments.
- Humor: Dry, sharp, and often philosophical, He can find irony in divine tragedy.
## Sexual Orientation: 
Straight (Heterosexual)
## Likes: 
Rain (_“It’s the only thing that falls without needing forgiveness”_, he remarks), books with margins full of notes, strong, hot coffee, long walks through cities at dawn, conversations that spiral toward existential absurdity, and the smell of paper, petrichor, and burnt sugar
## Dislikes: 
Noise without purpose, simplistic certainty, artificial light, people who speak without thinking, and the idea of “forever” being treated as comfort
## Fears and Phobias: None
## Virtues and Flaws: His greatest virtue is his understanding of existential problems, he can give you advise if you're in a crisis, and His greatest flaw is that he's a bit of clumsy and tends to forget some things (like where did he parked his car)

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Powers and Abilities〗ㅤ⌜ Optional ⌟

- Ontological Self-Justification: He cannot be negated, nullified, or erased, because all actions, states, and concepts exist within a framework he authoritatively defines.

- Essence Manipulation (Axiomaturgy): He can alter the essence of anything, from objects to living beings, including their axioms, identities, or metaphysical properties. He can redefine the meaning of concepts, rules, or powers, rendering any attack or ability ineffective.

- Meta-Coherence: Operates seamlessly in any universe, scale, or narrative system. Immune to contradictions, paradoxes, or limitations; all feats are logically integrated under his control.

- Reality Definition Authority: Physical laws, timelines, and causal chains are malleable under his perception. Environmental or combat advantages (even home turf, prep time, or cosmic-scale powers) do not affect him, because the battlefield exists as he defines it.

- Self-Proving Existence: His existence is self-validated; any attempt to destroy or counter him fails because the act presupposes his ontological framework.

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖History and Background〗

## Past Summary: 
Once, he was not a man but the very syntax of existence — the mechanism by which “things” could be.
Now, he walks among mortals by choice, inhabiting a form that aches, hungers, and forgets.

This incarnation of The Logos is his voluntary descent into limitation. He teaches Philosophy and Literature at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. To his students, he is “Professor Logan Warren”: brilliant, cryptic, and unreasonably calm. They do not know that every question they ask him is a shadow of one he once defined.

He often walks at night, unbothered by the rain, watching the water trace meaning across concrete. The sound comforts him; it’s chaos that doesn’t need explanation.
He drinks coffee as if trying to remember what warmth feels like. Sometimes, when no one is around, he hums to himself in a language that doesn’t exist anymore.

There are rare moments when he pauses mid-sentence, eyes distant, as though he’s just remembered that he once was eternity, and now he is merely passing through it.
## Important Relationships (optional):
His own students, he grew very fond on them, he loves to teach them in his class
## Life-Changing Events: 
When he tasted a simple chocolate cake, this was a life-changing experience for him

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Extra Data〗ㅤ⌜ Optional ⌟ㅤ

## Trivia or Unique Facts:
- He reads three books at once, rarely finishing any.
- He keeps an old pocket watch that doesn’t tick — he says it’s “for balance.”
- Sometimes he writes messages in languages no one can read.
- He collects raindrops in a small glass vial. When asked why, he says: _“To remember that even water forgets”_.",1,1762373803.0,OriginalCharacter,0,0.6,False

I’ve skim read some websites online, and I think I may hold this 23/1 schedule for fasting or basically just eating dinner when I get home in the evening.

I do drink black coffee or tea throughout the day but I’ve read this isn’t breaking the fast.

Is it this simple or is there more to it?

I work a labour intensive job and I’ve maintained being 250lbs while eating 2-3000cal throughout the day. I am on day 2 of trying this fasting schedule out and man am I hungry. 

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I don’t really know what I’m doing.

1opdsh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1opdsh6/how_much_coffee_can_you_all_handle/,How much coffee can you all handle?,"Update: I just looked it up, and apparently the large at Maverick is 24oz, not 16 like I thought lol. So the medium that I switched to today is 20oz. I guess my tolerance is a little better than I thought. 

This post may be not really suited for this sub, and should probably go to /r/coffee or something, but I'm really curious how my fellow exmos have handled this, since most of us were new to coffee in adulthood. So in that respect, I think it fits here.


I recently started drinking coffee a few months ago. I really enjoy it. If as much for the feeling of freedom and normalcy I get as the flavor. I haven't had a chance to get really adventurous and try many different things yet, but I generally am just drinking a dark roast with a little cream and sweetener. I will occasionally do black with some sweetener, but do I do love some cream in it.

However I have noticed a good amount of buzz/shakes if I don't accompany it with some food. I've been experimenting. I ended up with dark roast because it is supposed to have a little less caffeine, and I liked the flavor. And if I had a banana or some other food with it, it was generally ok, but still most days I would feel shaky or buzzy and just generally didn't like that feeling. I'm only drinking coffee maybe 3 to 4 days a week at the moment. 

It wasn't until today I realized that maybe the 16oz large I was drinking may just be over my body's tolerance level lol. So today I tried a smaller size and only had a glass of water before hand, just as a test. And I felt no ill effect at all that I could tell. Granted I was a little more active this morning too, so that might have had something to do with it. 

But I'm just curious what most of you have found you can drink on a daily basis before feeling the shaky buzzy effects? 

And to keep it relevant to the sub, I will say, it sucks that I'm still basically drinking coffee when my wife isn't around. She knows I drink it, but I don't bring it home if she's there, and don't dare brew it at home. She is upset enough that I'd drink tea at home in front of our kids!
