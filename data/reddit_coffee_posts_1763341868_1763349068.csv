1oz5ch1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1oz5ch1/does_anyone_have_good_lower_calorie_breakfast/,Does Anyone Have Good Lower Calorie Breakfast Ideas(?),"I have come to realize I have gained a little weight… and I’m not happy about it. I know it’s from eating out for breakfast when I go to work (we have a Starbucks) & honestly just eating not that great at work in general- which because I’m so active you think I would loose weight! 

I have a very difficult time eating early in the morning before work (makes me feel sick), so I have an apple. A few hours later is when I hit up our Starbucks for an expresso drink & a ham & cheese croissant. 

I am already tweaking my lunches to be healthier, I am just at a loss on what to make myself for breakfast. Does anyone have good breakfast ideas that would give me a little protein that is lower in calorie? It would need to be something I can just bring in and nibble on as I run around. 

Bonus points on something that gives me a “kick” like my caffeine drink does- because my coworkers can testify it really is my “happy juice” when I’m at work lol. And I do not like regular coffee- I like the creamy texture the expresso drink have.

1oz5aly,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1oz5aly/im_worried_about_my_dad/,I’m worried about my dad,"I’m so worried about my dad. My dad is 61 and has been a heavy drinker my whole life (I’m 21). He has a great job and is very successful and is a great dad and funny guy but he has a serious alcoholic problem. He drinks everyday without fail and it’s always more than one drink. If he’s working from home (he travels often for work) or it’s a weekend he often starts drinking at around midday. Often he also has a small glass of wine before leaving the house even if he’s driving or it’s the day. We have a restaurant a minute walk/drive from our house that we go to pretty frequently and he goes there several times a week and drinks. 

He also lies about his drinking all the time. There have been several times where my mom or I have seen his car in the parking lot and he lies about it. And he always pays with cash so my mom can’t track when he’s been there. He even lies when we have literally seen him drinking at home earlier in the evening. He lies right to our faces and says “I’m stone cold sober”

He also takes ambien to sleep a few times a week. 

Besides the multitude of issues this has caused in our family (my parents have a horrible relationship now and go to therapy for it), his anger issues, and the annoyance of having to deal with him, I’m extremely worried about his health. 

A few months ago he fell down the stairs because he was drunk and probably on ambien and broke four ribs. He didn’t even feel the pain till the next morning…

He loses things all the time. Like, every single day he can’t find his keys, phone, wallet, whatever. That’s not normal and I think it’s gotten worse lately. He always forgets where he puts stuff. He also is rlly shaky in his hands sometimes. That could be from the amount of coffee he drinks I’m not sure. 

I don’t know when he last went to the doctor, but whenever it was, he said that they said he’s totally healthy. I don’t know if I believe that. 

With the amount of alcohol he drinks each week I feel there is no way his liver is ok. 

My family has talked to him about his drinking a million times before and in past years he has stopped drinking for a month or so but not lately. I’ve cried to him about this countless times and he always says he’s going to be sober but never is. He had a very difficult childhood and young adult life and now he is under a lot of stress with his job and other things so I think he drinks to cope. He is a good man, and a good dad and I want him to be happy and healthy as long as possible. He never missed one school play or soccer game, always supports me and puts me and my siblings first, works so hard at his job and at home, and is funny and kind.  

As much as I feel annoyed by him and want to just move out and get away from him, I love him so so much and I don’t want him to be sick or die prematurely. I’m very worried about him.

Hello! Quick update lang.
Nag-post ako dati looking for a solid dental clinic around Cavite. and after finally trying Cavite Smile Station, masasabi ko: tama nga yung mga Google reviews nila and yung recommendations dito sa reddit.

My dentist explained everything clearly, walang judgment kahit medyo maraming kailangan ayusin sa ngipin ko. Staff were friendly (kudos, Ms Janette!) , maaliwalas yung place, and hindi ako na-pressure or na-intimidate! And more importantly, i didn’t feel judged!

Bonus pa: may free snacks and coffee (kahit sweets pa, pero natawa ako when they joked na may free toothbrush naman sila). 🤣

If you’re still clinic-hunting around the area, honestly worth checking out.

1oz58j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1oz58j1/how_do_i_stop_feeling_so_left_out/,How do I stop feeling so left out?,"I (20F) am a college student with a good group of friends. That is not up for debate or doubt. They have helped me through hard times and when they do include me it is the most fun time of my life. They are all very kind and I know none of the behavior I will be discussing is malicious... but that almost makes it hurt me more.

For some background, I had friends both in highschool and my freshman year of college who would get mad at me and then exclude me from activities with the rest of our friends. Both of them are out of my life now but I remain very sensitive to feeling excluded. I am also graduating a year early, so I am well aware that very soon in the future I will naturally feel so excluded due to being in a different stage in life, and am probably hyper-aware of whenever I can't be making the most of this final year of college.

That being said, I've felt more left out recently and it fills me with despair and frustration to the point of driving me to tears. I know this is not healthy. Some recent examples include:

\- My college hosted a Halloween dance. A huge group of my friends showed up (we're talking like 20 people, including my 3 closest friends) wearing a group costume, and came over to ask me to take pictures. I felt sick the whole time and left right after. I had no idea about this and felt so left out. My closest friends explained that it had grown unexpectedly and that they had all been brought in seperately, so it wasn't a coordinated choice to leave me out. Literally the night before we had gone to a halloween party together, so I had been included not too long prior.

\- 2 of my closest friends are clearly best friends. They have the same major, spend basically all day every day together. No big deal. But this often results in them going on spontaneous adventures together or talking late into the night on some corner on campus. If I ask to join them they always say yes, but they very rarely go out of their way to invite me. I fear if I don't ask, I'd never be included in these escapades.

\- One of our other friends had a birthday yesterday. We did a little party at a coffee shop and I was invited. Today a group got together very last minute and those two closest friends were invited, but I wasn't. They weren't the ones who set it up so they couldn't just invite me to come with. This get together consisted of entirely people who were my friends.

I just feel like I need to ask to be included more often than not, but I also have examples of times when I was included. How do I stop feeling so terrible about this? I promise you all they are good kind friends and I know they love me, and I am also not entitled to need to go along to every single event that my friends happen to be at. I just want to stop feeling so torn up about it. I don't want it to become an issue that I need to bring up to them because I already brought it up and don't want to be the crisis friend.

Edit: I know I said I had three closest friends. The two best friends are also F while the third is M. Most of the things I feel left out are usually just little girlie adventures which is why he is not there.",1,1763348472.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1oz5873,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oz5873/im_tired_of_onesided_conversations/,I’m tired of one-sided conversations,"UGH, why do people not know how to have actual conversations anymore? I genuinely love talking and listening. I want to hear about your life, your feelings, your stories, and I also want to share mine. I want real connection, not surface-level talking.

Even my best friend makes everything about himself. He never asks about me, and if I try to talk about my life, he somehow turns it back to him. The “talking stages” I’ve experienced feel so scripted — either they overshare everything with zero curiosity, or they say nothing at all.

Some people seem intimidated by normal conversation. Like please, let’s just go get coffee and actually talk like humans. But it feels like almost nobody knows how to have a good, balanced, meaningful conversation anymore. Even some of my closest girl friends can be so dry sometimes, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m the only one who notices this. Basic conversation etiquette is disappearing. And don’t even get me started on eye contact — that’s a whole separate problem.

1oz56u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1oz56u8/29_m4f_runninghiking_dates_tapos_yung_serious/,29 [M4F] Running/Hiking Dates tapos yung serious relationship talaga ang hanap ha,"I wouldn’t say my standards are unreasonable. I’m just economical with the back-and-forth and would rather meet in person if there’s genuine potential. Anyway, here’s my situation.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit**

Note: I’m reposting this since I haven’t found the right person yet. This will be my very last attempt - if it doesn’t work out, maybe online dating just isn’t for me. Still, I’ve met some good people along the way: some weren’t ready for anything serious, and with others, the connection just didn’t click. I’d like to reiterate that I’m looking for someone who’s physically active, confident, not obese, and who doesn’t do drugs or have tattoos.

I’ve shared with her all my strategies for how I’ve got to have the job at the place I work at, and how she can do the same. I’ve done this because she also wants to get a better job and get paid more. I’ll be retiring in five more years at 58, with a great pension. Unfortunately, her current employer doesn’t offer any pension benefits and she’s probably going to have to work till 70, or maybe she’s not going to be able to retire even then.

I don’t think that this friendship has a future. I feel guilty about that. I like her as a person, I like many of her personal traits but I dislike what she’s been doing with her life and her life choices she’s made for the last 20 years.

1oz531a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oz531a/seeking_advice_similar_experiences_unraveling/,"Seeking advice, similar experiences: Unraveling after getting off coffee and now trying Adderall","I am seeking advice and similar experiences to those that self medicated through large amounts of caffeine into adulthood prior to their ADHD diagnosis and then switched to Adderall or a similar medication. What was your experience?

Caffeine, upwards of 500 mg per day from coffee, has gotten me through undergrad and graduate school, but as I've moved into the professional world, I've sought balance and to solve what has seemed like anxiety. School counselors diagnosed me with serious anxiety during a particularly hard phase of my Ph.D.; however, everyone was anxious. After completing graduate school and getting job, I still felt off so I sought therapy again. That person said I had anxiety too, but we never really seemed to get anywhere. I moved to a different town and tried again. Now, this therapist is confident I have ADHD and referred me to a psychiatrist that put me on 10 mg of Adderall IR 2x/day while I've been off coffee.

Since starting Adderall, and stopping coffee, I've found my remote job (that I'm trying to leave) even more insufferable and rediscovered old hobbies and interests from high school, which was before I started drinking a lot of coffee. Reconnecting has been nice as I feel like I'm healing from a brutal graduate school experience, but I also feel like I'm ""off the mark"" with where I am now. I don't feel like I'm at risk of being fired before I can get a new job, but I can confidently say I'm not as productive now as I was when I was downing nearly 500 mg of caffeine via coffee.

By me! Except I never wanna do this again… if somebody is willing to help me draw stuff for concepts please PLEAAASE let me know. This was torture. And also, OC means original character. This isn’t like… my persona or smth it’s legit just a character I made just for this X3 please enjoy!

(Note: picture 1 is base ember picture 2 is MIV ember.)

It’s been a good second since I’ve posted and I have decided to try and make an OC concept this time! (This is not related to the 666 update I swear I started this before it was announced I swear I swear—). Also I decided I’d try doing this weekly because why not…

Custom effects:
Witherblade: depending on the stack of this effect, the duration of any given stun will increase by 50%. Capping at witherblade VI (400%)

Ember

$888

Sentinel

45 hp.

Regular speed: 12

Sprinting speed: 26

Max stamina: 100

Stamina loss per second: 10

Stamina gain per second: 20

Purchase quote:
“I am what survives the end.”

Description:
“A being forged from fire and erasure, he wields the Oblivion Blade to survive a world that no longer exists. Every strike risks everything, yet keeps him alive.”

Passives:

(Cleansing flame):
“LET THE MARTYRS BURN!!!”

any burning effect on ember heals him instead of dealing damage. The amount healed is equal to the amount he’d take if he’s hit by the burning. If ember is actively getting inflicted with burn this amount increases by 1 damage per dmg (so if he’s hit with 0.35 from burn, if he’s actively getting burned he heals 1.35 instead). Coolkid hard counter XD

(Dispel): 
“With this body of my creator, their chains cannot touch me…”

Ember cannot be inflicted with bleeding, corrupted, or poison. However, each one of these effects is swapped for weakness instead with the stack increasing from the severity of the effect.

(Last stand): 
“I give myself… to survive the end…”

if Ember is the LMS, all his damage dealing abilities instantly begin to deal 2x damage and inflict deletion IV (3% hp decrease per second) for 3 seconds. However, his witherblade is locked at II for the rest of the game. He also gains 50 hp

Abilities:
(Severance/erasure): 
“Just a spark… but it can cut through anything…” (severance)

“Feed the flame… and it will give you life.’… I must endure it, whatever it takes.” (Erasure)

cooldown: 10s 
Description: for each (this means after using the move which causes it to switch, the player must wait 10s before using the other variant)
Description: Severance causes ember to take out his dagger and do a 0.15s  windup before jabbing forwards. The jab has 0.2s of endlag. The jab gives ember 2s of speed II if it lands and 1.5s of slow III if it misses (if the distance from killer is > 40 studs changes to 4s). If the stab hits the killer it also knocks the killer back and inflicts slow IV for 2*(1+0.1*witherblade stack) seconds while stunning for 0.3s. It also grants 1 charge of immolation while dealing 25 dmg. If the stab misses ember’s aura is highlighted to the killer for 4s. After using severance the ability switches to erasure. If erasure is used, Ember forcibly erases a part of himself, severing flame from flesh. He gains 40 temporary HP (like max ho and it can stack). This move takes 3 seconds to use. If there are any negative debuffs on ember at this time they are also cleansed. It also creates a small burning area on the ground dealing 0.35 dmg per second to anybody (including the killer and survivors) standing inside it that lasts 3 seconds. This area heals ember instead inflicting burn. The move switches back to severance after. If ember is interrupted while using the ability, it fails but still switches back to severance.

(oblivion blade): 
“Now… witness the end of what should not have survived.”

cooldown: 45 seconds

Description: after 1.2s of windup, ember does a massive leap backwards while doing a spin before rushing forwards with their blade out, launching themselves forwards (similar to two times stab but going farther). Ember while moving can curve, sort of gliding but they can’t move too accurately and he slows down a bit if he’s turning. Ember may also not curve for the first 0.8s of the move however afterwards he could curve freely and even travel backwards like in a U-turn. After traveling for 5s, ember automatically smashes their sword into the ground causing a massive explosion that deals 20 damage to him and causes an aoe blast that if the killer is close enough to, deals 50 damage and stuns for 3 seconds. Unlike two time’s stab though, this slam will not auto activate when hitting the killer. Instead, if the ability is used again early, the slam will activate mid rush. The radius is pretty small so it’s really hard to get this to work. If the slam directly hits though, killers are inflicted with burn II for 4 seconds and blindness III for 8 seconds along with being knocked away and taking 75 damage. The killer also gets stunned for 5 seconds instead along with having their aura revealed to all survivors for 2 second. The radius for this stun is EVEN smaller though. It takes insane precision and prediction to even hope to land this version. If the player misses completely and slams the ground with the killer not even being in the blast radius, they take 30 damage and are forced to sit through a 3 second long animation of ember pulling their blade out the floor. If the slam lands it’s reduced to 1s (so they land the slam and only take 1s to take their blade out). Their aura is also revealed to the killer for 8 seconds if they mess up. The slam does create a small area that inflicts burn II and slow I for anybody standing inside the area like in immolation. This area lingers for 3 seconds. Oh and for balancing purposes if the killer is stunned for more than 10 seconds by an oblivion blade, their stun immunity duration is increased by like 2x increasing by another 1x for every extra 5s. For every additional ember in the match stun time decreases by 0.5s. Move cannot be canceled midway through by the killer by moves except nova, entanglement, gashing wound, and the rush move from guest 666.

(Immolation): 

“If I am to live, the flame must consume me… and I will rise from it.”

cooldown: 10 seconds. Requires a charge for use.

Description: after 0.5s of windup, ember stabs himself causing a massive explosion that deals 40 damage to him and inflicts him with burning I for 4 seconds. If a killer is close enough to ember while he uses this ability, they will be knocked away and stunned for 1.5s seconds, taking 30 damage in the process. Ember also gains speed I for 5 second after use but also weakness V for 8 seconds. In the location Ember used this ability, a small area of fire will linger for 8 seconds inflicting burning I and slowness I on anything that enters (yes even survivors). After the use of this move, ember also gains 1 stack of witherblade.

Intended playstyle: he’s a snowball survivor. The main inspiration behind this survivor is that when the slasher update rolled around two time was literally completely gutted. His so called “hitbox fixes” made trickstabbing pretty much impossible. He was in my opinion the most skilled survivor so I drafted up a concept for what I think is the most rewarding but skill based survivor. His goal is simply to just run up to the killer and help survivors via landing severance. Then he runs off to escape and use erasure before using immolation. He repeats this process surviving the killer each time since literally 2 hits kill him unless he has high erasure. Once he has high witherblade, the killer suffers as a skilled ember can stun them for like 20s.

Lore: so, I always feel like Taph could have so much more potential with his lore, so with this, I hope to give him an expansion on this. I have another killer concept that ties these two together hopefully coming soon :3 Long ago, Ember existed inside a now-lost Roblox game. An old adventure world built in that charming, nostalgic style only early Roblox could capture. He wasn’t a hero or a chosen one; he was simply an NPC within a small cult devoted to “the Flame,” the sacred heart of their world.

But everything changed the day the game’s creator deleted his account. With the owner gone, the world could no longer stay online. Builderman had recently begun relying on a creature unintentionally created by Taph — a living demolition engine called The Core to help erase old games quickly and efficiently. The Core was sent to dismantle Ember’s dying world, burning everything it touched with a dissolving, erasure-like flame.

When Ember came into contact with those flames, something impossible happened. The fire didn’t destroy him. It made him aware. The erasure flame ate through his body, stripping away the boundaries of what he was supposed to be, but Ember refused to let himself be forgotten. Through sheer willpower, he survived the destruction, merging with the very fire meant to eliminate him. His body twisted into white-blue flames and unstable essence, a being held together only by stubborn, agonizing determination.

Before his world fully vanished, Ember seized the “Hero’s Weapon” from his game’s scripted questline, desperately attempting to strike back at The Core. When the blade touched the entity, the weapon was corrupted and reborn as the Oblivion Blade, inheriting the same erasure power that devoured the world. Ember alone could wield it, because he was already fused with the flame that created it.

One strike from the Oblivion Blade was all it took. The Core glitched, buckled, and collapsed into bugs, forced to return to Builderman, malfunctioning and unable to continue its work. (The consequences… well, that’s a story for when The Core gets revealed. Next weeks killer…?)

Now, Ember stood alone in the ruins of his game, the last surviving fragment. Only his small altar and the strange erasure-flames remained. In his loneliness, he began to believe these flames were his cult’s sacred fire, surviving as he had.

With no physical body left, Ember spent uncounted time training himself to endure the torment of the flames that made him. He learned to heal, reshape, and sustain himself through rituals remembered from his cult, feeding what little “flesh” he had to the fire in order to remain whole. Over time he mastered his new abilities, infusing both the Oblivion Blade and his dagger with the same consuming energy.

Frailty became strength. Pain became power.
And all that remained of his world became his purpose.

Eventually, Ember cast himself into the edge of existence, leaving the wreckage of his forgotten home behind in search of the core again, killing himself. Now, in the Forsaken realm, he hunts for the truth of the flame, seeking the creature he calls “the beast who stole our sacred fire.”

He wanders not for revenge alone, but to protect others from the same fate his own world suffered choosing to strike down the killers.

Achievements: 
milestone I-IV: same as usual.
Oncoming traffic: stun the killer with oblivion blade starting from 50 or more studs away.

Skins: 
Cultist ($200): gives ember his old cultist outfit. So he has a full robe and hood and his dagger gets switched to an old one. Oblivion blade has no effect and is just a broadsword. 

Skeleflame ($400): has a skeleton within the flame which has turned black and purple

Dullahan: ($600): his head turns into a pumpkin with a flame in it. All explosion also play a cackling sound when used. His sword is replaced with a staff with a pumpkin on it.

underground ($600): it’s ember but with Grillby’s outfit and has his glasses.
Fine ($900): turns into the “this is fine” dog. Immolation is just drinking coffee
Angel of flame ($1000): Ember wears an angelic white robe instead of his regular outfit. His blade is now white instead and he has 2 wings made of fire. All fire is now white also.

Ogre ($1300): just turns him straight up into shrek. All the flame effects are replaced with green swamp effects. His oblivion blade is now a wooden stick while his dagger is a smaller stick. Immolation becomes a literal fart and so does erasure =-= when he goes to use oblivion blade all stars begins to play.

Wishbearer ($1500): okay a little backstory on this. I have a concepted story for this original world and in it are these different wishes that are basically powers if I had to explain it in the simplest way. One guy has an ability born from his wish called “hot ice” which I decided to use as the base of this skin.  Ember’s entire body switches to a guy wearing crystalline armor with shards jutting out. His face is covered by a bandanna and he gains hair which looks light blue and white with a few streaks of orange. Instead of the oblivion blade he has an ice spear and his dagger is also now white. With every step he leaves a path of small ice which after 3 seconds turns to steam. All of the explosions and fire pools he makes are reskinned to be ice instead with ice spikes jutting out the ground . With severance instead of just jabbing forwards he summons a wild mass of jutting ice crystals to stab forwards before they all eventually turn to steam. Mmmm

The anomaly ($1800): changes the skin to that of glitchtale chara with flames surrounding them. Severance is replaced with a slash that if it hits the killer, causes a 99999 dmg hit effect to come up. If it’s a miss it’ll say miss. Regardless it’ll do the animation undertake uses for slashing. Erasure causes chara to open her menu to find items, eating a random one. Oblivion blade does the same animation for ember but has the flowey “that’s a wonderful idea!” Sound play. Also the knife is replaced. All the fire is also now red and black glitch particles and the path that is traveled leaves a black and red version of basically the annihilation John Doe skin trail. Immolation is the player opening the reset option and slamming onto it. Custom LMS vs. Disbelief

Milestone I: Ember’s outfit is slightly charred now with black spots and maybe even some burned parts. Oblivion blade gains a few orange cracks on it that glow slightly. Also ember smokes a little now. Like there’s a black foggy effect around him slightly. Also the dagger has an orange tip on it now. Animation for immolation now also leaves small embers in that area for a short period of time. 

Milestone II: ember’s body grows brighter. He gains a cape that’s still burned like his clothes. The oblivion blade gains some glitchy red particles around it with a little more detail on the blade itself too. Also the cracks on the blade get brighter. The dagger is now on fire with an orange flame. His adventuring outfit becomes slightly more intricate starting to look more like a cultists uniform.

Milestone III: Ember gains shoulder plates that are made of black stone and have the orange cracks on them. The rest of his body is covered in his outfit that has even more intricate designs. His body is now made of white flames while his cape gains red streaks all over it. The dagger now has blue flames around it. The rest of ember’s body is glitching too. Also he gains a cultist hood over his head while his head seems to begin to manifest with no features.

Milestone IV: Ember’s cape is now jagged at the ends and his clothes are glowing and burning. Each one of his steps leaves a small flame for 2 seconds turns to smoke. The rest of his body is mostly covered in armor but he still has his cultist like outfit underneath. His entire body turns into a combination of white and blue fire. His face has manifested on his head but it has no eyes or mouth. The mouth is covered by a bandana. The hood gains strange glowing orange symbols. Black and orange crystals protrude from around his outfit too. There’s even some glowing flowers growing. The oblivion blade is decorated in crystals and now glows with the cracks and is surrounded by glitchy particles. Dagger is the same. All explosion animations also cause crystals to burst out of the ground and flowers made of fire to bloom there for a couple seconds. The dagger also has small rocks orbiting around it.  Using oblivion blade also chases ember to seem to flicker in and out. 

Driving in my caaaar (oncoming traffic achievement): turns into asgore lmao. When oblivion blade is used he gets into a car instead and starts speeding forwards. Pressing the move again causes the car to explode. All hit boxes are the same. Severance instead causes a small car to appear infront of the player and ram forwards. Erasure is just drinking a beer. Immolation is a car that falls onto the skin and explodes. 

Borrowed time (withered hearts achievement): this skin takes HEAVY inspiration from the lore of two time and Heathcliff from limbus company. This character and the associated Eternity skin for core are both from the same wish world as hot ice. So there once were these two people, one named Caelum and the other named Ashen. The story takes place after a massive star-like planet fell into earth giving wish-based abilities to the people on earth. That’s the basic summary there’s a lot more about these wishes but the most you gotta know is that. Ashen and Caelum were two kids that lost their parents during the impact and were taken in by a scientist like group. They bonded together while the adults pretty much just committed multiple human rights violations trying to figure out and understand the wishes. Now I’m not gonna bore you with all the details but the two got close and eventually were put into an experiment where the lab people would attempt to finally create their own wish. Through this time Caelum had been manipulated by the scientists to seek the “greater good” with these wishes as almost a god like entity (this is funny because it’s like the flipped version of ember’s lore where this time ember’s skin isn’t the cultist). For the “greater good” Caelum is forced to sacrifice the thing he loves most which they think will create a wish. Knowing that it’s Ashen, Caelum goes through with it at this point thinking the wish is worth it. Ashen hears about this plan and decides not to intervene. She was already dying from some weird allergy to the original stars sort of “wish” aura thing which nobody knew about and decides that seeing Caelum’s determination, that she wants her last moment to be giving herself to him. Caelum stabs Ashen in the back with a crude dagger killing her as she smiles in his arms. After the act, Ember in a sort of moment of clarity realizes what he had done. No wish was also made so it was pointless. With his pure rage and anguish he does manifest a wish. “Don’t fade—don’t fade, don’t fade, DON’T FADE! If the world takes you, then I’ll MAKE it remember you! I wish you’d never stop burning in it!”(“I wish she would stay, burning in the world until nothing else remained.”) and so his he gains the ability to conjure flames that last forever and can set any object on fire, adopting the name Eternal flame and burning the facility to the ground. (Full description of his ability is: (The user may conjure projectiles of fire that after hitting an enemy, permanently set them on fire. This effect cannot be canceled and lasts until the wish disappears (basically never). This flame does not produce sparks and only spreads through direct contact. User may also appear in any flame they had set previously.) with the world never doing anything for him he vows to set everything ablaze, going on a hunt to kill every other wish bearer or person that crosses his path. Years and years later another wish user dies and has their wish bottle dropped near the initial lab place where the one thing that remained was the untouched corpse of Ashen. From the wish Ashen is awoken and gains the ability to live for just 1 hour. With Eternal Flame also there, Ashen sees what he has become and confronts him only for Calleum, now totally gone, to attack Ashen. Ashen’s hope for Caelum to change grants her a blade able to pierce Caelum. With pure determination (and from not even being technically human anymore as they’re a memory), the two battle to the death with Caelum especially now wanting Ashen dead. Okay that’s the very short summary of it but onto the actual skin description. Ashen’s body is replaced with a more darkish charcoal looking body. Parts of her body are cracked and emanate black and white sparks along with glowing purple and orange while pulsing. Her entire body is also covered in white and black flames. The blade is replaced with a massive magma coated orange broadsword that drips and leaves a small and short lasting magma trail. There are some black cracks on it though. Her hair is long and her face looks calm. The outfit is replaced with black stone plated armor with a robe under it with many golden sigils all across it. Parts of the robe flicker in and out with glitchy particles. Her body is also slightly transparent. Half of embers face is her glowing skull while the other is her regular face. Both her eyes glow faintly though. Above her head is a shattered halo made of glasslike particles. She also has wings made of ash on her. She also has a cape that’s heavily burnt and charred. The hourglass has been replaced with a destroyed version that emanates orange light. Wrapped around her arms are golden chains. A silver hourglass charm also dangles around her neck. Dagger is replaced with a black curved version that looks slightly more like a sickle. It’s black and looks like it’s made of ash while glowing a little orange. Upon using immolation for the first time, the Ashen’s wings grow and spread, before changing into a glowing white more crystal-like one. they also gain a crown made of crystals. Severance switches to a fire slash instead of a stab. It does a wide swing and leaves a fiery effect. If it hits something then it will cause a miniature explosion. Erasure makes Ember create a circle on the floor with his dagger and cutting himself to bleed onto the ground. Then, he stomps causing the circle to glow orange and be set ablaze before eventually fading out. Oblivion blade is given extra effects as the glide causes sparks to burst from the ground. Immolation is the same though. The player for oblivion blade has her do two flips backwards instead of the jump before she jumps forwards with the ground under hear when she jumps and glides being given a fiery explosion effect. The auto ending has her jump and do a front flip to smash the blade into the ground.

You may recall a bit back where this sub was sharing its living spaces, showing off their collections, shelves and so on.

That inspired me in part to de-clutter and improve on my own living space by comparison. Sadly, I'm still not a complete homeowner, so I have to make do with my limited space, but figuring out what was feasible or not did keep me entertained throughout the year.

A lot of it also came down to a series of Domino Effects I experienced throughout the year. Case in point: when I verbally lamented how I hated having my meager collection of books housed inside a cabinet when they showed be openly displayed, my mother suggested I get a bookshelf. I thought there was no way I could fit one, but with some precise measuring it turned out there was a cheap, easy-to-install shelf from Amazon that I was able to try out (spoilers: nearly every damn thing you're about to see came from Amazon. I certainly put my Prime membership and return policies to exhaustive use, while Wario undoubtedly got their cut as I continue to have their Bluesky page open even as I type this).

[I was quite happy with the results](https://ibb.co/r2g5pvD0), but being terminally OCD, I had debated on whether the book shelf looked better on one corner of the room vs the other. While testing this out, I ended up knocking out one of my fan blades. The fan was already an ancient, squeaking relic, and to skip ahead over a month of trial-and-error, I settled on a DREO Smart Fan. This is also when I discovered the joys of smart home devices, which led to me getting an Alexa along with some other stuff I'm going to list below.

Eventually, thanks to Woot, [I ended up with a second and even cheaper bookshelf](https://ibb.co/svLh4j00). This also led to me [moving my coffee station](https://ibb.co/gFDdzF16) right next to my desk, which works out a lot better since I work at home and this spares me the hasty walk to-and-from the Keurig between calls. Everything else shown here, from the jug of water to the food lids to the cat poster and the reading light once again came from Amazon as I continued to improve my living space with as much convenience as possible.

Speaking of reading, I ended up doing a 180 on my previous conceit of insisting how it was better to have a tablet to collect comics, books and manga, considering how much space they would take up and how a single Kindle could hold three libraries worth of material. My sister was always insistent that physical books were better (""You can't replace how they feel in your hands""). Again, the Domino Effect hit me, and before I knew it I was hastily filling up my new bookshelf space with [the results of my Wario-following, FOMO-addled impulses](https://ibb.co/VcCxcbHn)....it was bad enough Amazon had a B2G1 on several hefty artbooks and manga collections, but to go and have another one the next month after....[this is from last night, and it STILL isn't everything](https://ibb.co/PvT40L3F)!

(the Goku funko was a gift btw, don't judge)

But wait, there's more: while attending a baby shower, my sister invited me to check out Five Below, which I never went to before. Sure enough, she was right in that there was some legitimately good deals to be found, including [this sweet Godzilla poster](https://ibb.co/hxP1MZ7g) that I was inspired to get in order to fill an empty space in my wall. Originally it was going to face my bookshelf, but being a classic film I felt it worked better sitting above my 4K/DVD/Blu shelf, which I also ended up moving (and subsequently started getting more 4K movies as a result....Wall-E is still a 10/10 movie, I have no problem calling it the best Pixar movie).

The problem though is that while the poster was a mere $5, poster frames were much harder to come by at a reasonable price. Ultimately I had to settle on a 3 pack from Walmart for $30, which meant I had two more posters to fill up. I went to another Five Below in the hopes I could snag an awesome Luffy wanted poster that was sold out in the first one. I tried to get them to sell me the display poster but they wouldn't budge. The people in the second Five Below, however, had no problem with that, [which made me very happy](https://ibb.co/9H3207DM). That just left one poster left and the space in front of my bookshelf still wanting. Being how the majority of my books were horror-based, [this felt the most appropriate](https://ibb.co/spvXw4wr).

But I still had one space left in my wall that I wanted to fill. After buying some acrylic stands (yes, again, Amazon), I ended up creating what I call the [Nintendo Bleachers](https://ibb.co/dsrMBJby). Yeah, I like Amiibos, even had to talk myself out of getting the Samus w/Viola bike Amiibo that I saw at Best Buy today (waiting to see if it'll go on sale like those SF6 and Zelda ones...you can spot two of them in that last photo).

I spent hours looking for a Nintendo-themed poster I could hang above them, but just wasn't satisfied with the available results. That's when I looked into creating my own custom poster, which turned out was something Wal-Mart did. I inquired in a Photoshop sub on how to save the best quality image for the desired dimensions, only to get chewed out by someone saying that Wal-Mart wouldn't accept my photo because of copyright, and how I'm setting a bad example with my ""bootleg poster"".

I couldn't possibly be the only person to have Wal-Mart print out a poster from...I dunno, the MCU, Demon Slayer, whatever's trending. But yeah, my request went through and [the finished product exceeded my expectations](https://ibb.co/27B4ncYR). Legitimately excellent art from an excellent series.

Oh, and the photo frames you're seeing throughout? Once more a Domino Effect: in that same baby shower I went to, there was a nearby library that had an open box of donated books. In them was a 4x6 frame with a Peter Rabbit image. I thought that would look nice on my bookshelf so I took it. During one random late night, while walking out of my room, the picture frame somehow fell behind me, breaking poor Peter Rabbit's frame. Coincidentally, this was also when Wario posted a Walgreens special of 20 free 4x6 poster cards. You guessed it, more Amazon binging, but once more [I'm pleased with the results](https://ibb.co/r21JF04D).

There's still even more that I did, such as [arranging figures in my shelves while also adding motion lights above them](https://ibb.co/cc1tyZtg). And speaking of lights, being 6'4 in a medium-lit room casts a big shadow over my books and movies, and after a lot more research and trial-and-error, [I gave Govee light strips a try](https://ibb.co/6c2z1gTY), and they did exactly what I wanted, and can be controlled with Alexa. Yep, more smart home shit.

There's still a lot of things I want to work on, some empty drawers that I need to figure out what to do with. Two drawers are spoken for with [my box of Model Kits](https://ibb.co/WWT6GDw6). Still currently working on Optimus Prime, [with this bad buy following right after](https://ibb.co/1tMfw8Sm). Once I get them done, however, I'm going to have to do another round to decide [where some figurines should go](https://ibb.co/xtGJ1Q0r) and which should be donated (I used to have a lot more crap not shown here, like 8 bags of stuff donated...a lot of it came from Loot Crate, which [occasionally had something worth keeping](https://ibb.co/1t1FBLdY) but was mostly junk. And as you can see, my OCD nature means I've been attempting to keep each shelf ""themed"", such as stuff that's only Marvel, a Batman and Friends shelf, Dragon Ball, etc).

And yeah, [my Final Fantasy shrine](https://ibb.co/cc1tyZtg) remains mostly untouched, but also rearranged with new stands and positions to look better, along with some extra posters I found from old magazines (the two posters from the far right were actually included from an eBay purchase of AC Cloud with Fenrir, which I got to replace my original AC Cloud which fell and broke its leg....again, Domino Effect all year).

In conclusion, while it's not the most ideal or prettiest looking space, especially my closet which filled with stored boxes of stuff I'm slowly selling on eBay (and a watchful guardian making sure no pesky cats steal my stuff), I still feel proud over all the DIY and home-making efforts I made this year.

I have 10 days off. I usually do a few 3-4 day fasts each year. This year I plan on pushing out to a 7-10 day fast.  Part of this is for the autophagy and health and a part is to get leaner prior to the holiday feasting. 


Coffee
Water
Salt
Potassium
Magnesium

Undecided on essential amino acids. Was considering maybe taking 15 grams daily after day 3 to help decrease muscle loss.  Want at least 3 days with zero calories. 

*cjc/ipamorelin 
*tesa
*aod9604

Growth hormone should spike during fasting, but wanted to augment that effect and also want to avoid losing muscle mass, I realize some loss is inevitable. 

*reta 

I've done a few cycles of Reta, not sure how much effect it would have on a fast versus just doing it without and GLP meds. 

Urolithin A - augment the autophagy during fasting.

**About me:**

* 28 years old, 5’7"" (tall enough to get things sa top shelf, short enough to still need a stool minsan)
* Working hybrid in Taguig, taga-Manila pero pwede makipag-Makati rendezvous
* *Chill kuya energy* built for long talks, pasyal, and foodtrips (tuyo to ramen to samgyupsal, game)
* Gamer (Mobile + PC), pero di ako toxic, medyo competitive lang lol
* Semi-fit, medyo tumataba, pero may puso (literally and figuratively)
* Night owl, but willing to switch to “good morning mahal” hours if needed
* No vices except buying coffee at 11PM
* Love language: quality time + a bit of spoil-you energy (yes, I’ll bring you snacks and listen to you rant)

**Looking for:**

* Someone kind, funny, a little bit curious about everything
* Kaya makipag-witty banter pero marunong din mag-seryoso
* Bonus if mahilig ka sa food adventures, street food, or night walks
* Someone emotionally mature (yung di bigla mag-vanish like Thanos snapped)
* Cute laugh (pero okay din kung snort ka, cute yun)
* Single and ready to *try* not rush, not force just vibe muna tayo

**What I offer:**

* Conversations from “kumain ka na?” to “ano gusto mo sa future?”
* Genuine care I love listening, supporting, and spoiling when the energy is mutual
* Spot sa passenger seat pag foodtrip tayo
* A place to be yourself and be appreciated for it

Sorry we're all a part of this subreddit.

​I've been dealing with what I strongly suspect is Interstitial Cystitis for my entire teenage and adult life. I've only recently learned that IC existed so I thought that I've just been dealing with on and off UTIs every few months that cure themselves with D-Mannose which I take religiously.

My symptoms usually manageable and pretty much nonexistent for the most part, but the last two weeks have been the absolute worst of my life. Intense, constant burning in my urethra and bladder. ​Persistent urgency, even after just going. Suspected UTI, went on antibiotics, no fix and culture came back negative.

I was desperate. I read all the advice and decided to go full elimination diet: I immediately stopped all caffeine, thinking that was the obvious culprit. No coffee, no energy drinks, nothing acidic. I stuck with it, but guess what? Zero improvement. The pain persisted. I got so fed up, I basically said ""Fuck it."" Why am I giving up coffee if I'm still feeling awful?

This morning I woke up feeling great. I intentionally drank my usual coffee and ate and drank all the supposed ""no-nos"" that the IC diet says to avoid. And suddenly, today, for the first time in weeks, I feel 100% normal. It didn't flare up later on in the day like it usually does. No pain, no burning, no urgency. It's completely fine.
​

I truly don't believe anyone really knows what triggers this condition. It feels like it's all trial and error, a random guessing game, and it absolutely sucks. It makes me question everything I've ever read about IC triggers. ​This stupid ailment is so frustrating, unpredictable, and anxiety-inducing.",4,1763346796.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

We’ve gone through a hot water every 6-8 months. Just one day the machines will not get above 50C instead of 100C. We do turn it off daily, is this a factor to the problem? It’s running off of city water which is hard water and could be rusting the anode. But we’ve had other issues with water getting into parts it shouldn’t be like the electronic board.

1oz4fod,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oz4fod/aita_for_throwing_away_trash_in_my_neighborhood/,AITA for throwing away trash in my neighborhood?,"I (M32) live in Seattle, in the actual city, not one of the outskirt neighborhoods that call themselves Seattle. I live in the Cap hill/central district area, iykyk. Seattle obviously has a homelessness issue, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic place to live. I'm not a NIMBY who doesn't understand homelessness or inherently hates homeless people. Times are tough and many of these people are sick and cannot get help, I am sympathetic to that. 

There's this guy that is homeless in my neighborhood, let's call him Jeff. Jeff is a drug-addicted homeless man (maybe 40-50) with a buying/hoarding mental issue and probably some other conditions. He's been in the neighborhood a while and is not dangerous. He often comes into shops and etc for free food and will wave to you on the sidewalk or even chat with you for a minute-- no problems there. 

Thing is, Jeff likes to find a shopping cart and either go to goodwill or find a juicy dumpster and fill that cart to the brim with just garbage-- mostly broken TVs, speakers, electronics and things that he perceives as valuable. If they once worked, they certainly don't after sitting in the rain for a week. Every now and then you'll see an abandoned card full of early 2000's electronics and think ""oh that's Jeff's"". 

Recently, Jeff's been hoarding HARD. There were 5 shopping carts worth of junk lined up outside the neighborhood coffee shop. He did this same thing last year, and it caught fire somehow, threatening to burn down the building and causing damage to the nearby nail salon. As such, a group of concerned neighbors were gathered around the carts discussing what to do about them (the city doesn't do anything) and they elected to push the carts to the building's dumpster and throw all Jeff's shit away. I agreed, went home to get some gloves, and helped in the effort. 

A group of younger adults (gender ambiguous) came up and were kind of non-confrontationally not okay with what we were doing-- ""That's Jeff's stuff, he's a good guy!"" etc etc. They thought we were doing something shady by tossing his stuff when he wasn't there. Side note-- we separated out anything that could even potentially be of any value to Jeff; food scraps, clothes, etc, and only threw away the 5 or so carts filled with bricked electronics. 

The younger kids were clearly upset with us for doing this and it seemed like they had arranged a deal with Jeff in where he was able to ""safely"" leave his stuff there, even temporarily. So long story short, AITA for pitching this dude's literal garbage in a garbage can? 

I want to help these people and not make their hard lives any harder, I truly mean that. But I'm tired of dodging garbage in my neighborhood. I'm tired of my dog stepping in broken glass. I'm tired of wondering if one of the homeless folks is going to light something on fire. ",1,1763346222.0,AmItheAsshole,16,0.6,False

Extra! 11/16 💐💐, Jess Craven's Weekly Good News","Hi, all, and happy Sunday!

It’s true! Even after a week that contained colossal legislative disappointments, new ICE attacks in Charlotte, and more deeply disturbing Epstein stories, we still have a chock-full list of wins to celebrate. Let’s make sure we take time to savor each one, because if we only focus on the dark stuff we’re going to lose our minds!

Thank you for all of the hard work you’re doing to ensure that week after week, these Sunday posts continue to be replete with positive news. I know that as long as you’re in the mix the victories will keep coming.

So let’s get to the good things that happened this week! Enjoy!

Celebrate This! 

It’s official! Democrat Pulkit Desai, a U.S. Marine combat veteran, has been elected mayor of Parsippany, NJ. He defeated Republican incumbent James Barberio by 77 votes.

Tesla (TSLA) has fallen 18% since November 3, erasing more than $280,000,000,000 in market value, and is on track for its worst month since February.

Georgia’s State Election Board agreed to stop conducting its work behind closed doors after settling a lawsuit that revealed members had been using private emails and messaging apps to discuss election rules.

A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot fine the University of California or summarily cut the school system’s federal funding over claims it allows antisemitism or other forms of discrimination.

Democratic Socialist Katie Wilson has been declared the winner of the election for mayor of Seattle!

President Obama surprised dozens of veterans after their plane arrived in Washington for Veterans Day.

For the first time in decades, the Los Angeles city council overhauled its rent control rules, sharply lowering the annual rent increases facing tenants in one of the country’s most expensive cities.

A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay a little more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023 that sparked an outcry over press freedom. (I’m pretty sure we called about this!)

South Park is basically devoting their whole season to trolling Trump, and their ratings are way up as a result.

America’s Roman Catholic bishops issued a rare statement on Wednesday in support of immigrants, their most forceful collective action yet that rebukes the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign.

A Baltimore police officer who was seen chasing a person in his police cruiser has been charged with attempted murder.

In a win for Wisconsin voters, a state judge vacated a ruling that would have forced election officials to conduct mass citizenship checks — a move voting rights advocates warned could have wrongly purged some citizens from the rolls.

The 200 federalized California National Guard members sent to Portland, Oregon, and another 200 federalized Texas National Guard members sent to Chicago will return to their home states. The federalized Guard troops arrived in those cities in early October but never deployed operationally because of legal challenges that continue playing out in the courts.

Trump signed an executive order to get rid of tariffs on a broad swath of commodities, including beef, coffee and tropical fruits.

As ICE attacks their city, protestors are marching peacefully through Charlotte to say HELL NO. Solidarity, NC!

E biked there, and usually I would too, but right as I was about to leave my dad said could use the car. At this point E had already left and so I didn't offer her a ride bc she wouldn't have seen it while she was biking. 

So we arrive and are having a good time, when at like 4:30 she said she needed to leave soon because she wanted to get back before it got dark. This makes sence, but the plan had bee to at least stay till 6. I offered E a ride but because she took her bike she couldn't because the bike wouldn't fit in the car. I said she. I suggested E bike home then I pick her up and we can go back, (it would've only taken like 10 min tops) but she said no. 

At this point I was upset but didn't want to make a scene at the coffee shop so u let it go. Today I went saw E and we had an argument where she said that I was being ridiculous for being upset, but I said she should have tried harder to make it work. so AITA?",3,1763345951.0,AITAH,5,0.8,False

I (15 months, the best little man) am a man of science. I have been closely examining cause and effect. It's so exciting when I push a button and something happens!

One of my favourite things to explore is the toilet. I pull the shiny lever, and the water swirls away! Of course, for the sake of the reliability of my data, I must repeat this experiment often. 

In the spirit of inquiry, I wondered what would happen if I threw things in the toilet and then flushed. Would they, too, swirl away? I hypothesized that they would, and began my experiment. 

Readers, my hypothesis failed. Mommy's (old, F, always muttering about more coffee) hair brush did not flush away. Mommy looked up from brushing my sister's (3yo, practically a grown up) teeth and said my name really loudly, sighed, and took the hairbrush out and threw it away. I think sabotaging a scientists experiment is rude, but I digress.

I’m graduating soon, and I’ve been putting so much into finding a full-time role. I've been actively applying, reaching out on LinkedIn, sending cold emails, setting up coffee chats, attending industry events, doing online assessments, and following up whenever I can. It feels like I’m doing everything I’m supposed to do.

But even with all that, things just aren’t moving forward. Some places don’t respond at all, others take weeks, and sometimes I make real progress before everything stops suddenly. I even had a situation recently where things were going really well with a firm, genuine conversations with the partners, positive signs and then it fell apart simply because of my visa status.

What’s making everything harder is the timing. December is coming up, which means a lot of companies will slow down and hiring usually restarts in January. Meanwhile, my visa situation means I’m under time pressure, and it makes me feel like the clock is ticking faster than I can keep up.

I’ve had moments where I wonder if I should just go back home… but another part of me still wants to hold onto this dream of starting my career here. It feels like I’m caught between wanting to stay and feeling like time is running out.

I’m not giving up, but I’m struggling.

For anyone who’s been through something similar especially other international students:

• How did you cope with the stress and uncertainty?  
• Did things eventually work out for you?  
• What would you do in my position?

Any advice or reassurance would really mean a lot.",0,1763345464.0,AusVisa,13,0.5,False
1oz45o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oz45o6/what_smart_plugs_for_vacation_homes/,What smart plugs for vacation homes?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been managing my vacation home remotely for about two years now, and honestly, smart plugs have been absolute game-changers for me. I wanted to share what I've learned because I see this question pop up all the time.

**Why Smart Plugs Matter for Vacation Properties**

When you're not physically at your second home, things can go wrong. Pipes can freeze, it can look obviously empty to burglars, or you might just want to prep the place before guests arrive. Smart plugs let you control basically anything that plugs into an outlet from your phone, no matter where you are.

**What I Actually Use Them For**

I've got mine connected to lamps on timers so the place looks lived-in. I also control a space heater in the basement during winter to prevent freezing, and I can turn on fans before I arrive so it's not stuffy. Some people even use them for coffee makers or slow cookers to have dinner ready when they show up.

The wifi-enabled ones are obviously the most convenient because you can control them from anywhere. The scheduling features are clutch too - you can set routines so lights turn on and off at different times automatically.

**What Actually Works**

After trying a bunch of different options, I found that you really want plugs that work with Alexa or Google Home, have good app reviews, and don't randomly disconnect from wifi. The cheaper ones sometimes lose connection and it defeats the whole purpose.

If you're looking to grab some for your place, I'd recommend checking out [this collection of smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) that covers most of the reliable brands. They've got different options depending on whether you need indoor, outdoor, or energy monitoring features.

**Installation Tips**

Setup is usually pretty straightforward - download the app, plug it in, connect to your wifi network. Just make sure your vacation home has stable internet. I upgraded to a mesh wifi system because my router wasn't reaching the whole house.

Also, label everything in the app. Trust me, ""living room lamp 1"" and ""living room lamp 2"" makes way more sense than ""device_847239.""

**Power Monitoring Is Underrated**

One feature I didn't think I'd care about but actually love is energy monitoring. You can see which devices are using power and catch problems. Like when my fridge started drawing way more electricity than normal, I knew something was up before everything spoiled.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs aren't expensive and they give you serious peace of mind when you're away from your vacation property. Being able to check in and control things remotely is worth every penny.

If you want to compare different models and see what fits your needs, [here's where I'd start looking](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). Just make sure whatever you get has solid reviews and works with your existing smart home setup if you have one.

Fast forward ngayon, he’s suddenly messaging again like nothing happened. T-gang pa rin, zero respect, same entitled attitude. Like, hello? Boundaries much? It’s wild how some people think they can just ignore everything they did and assume you’re fine with it.

1oz3z6i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz3z6i,Wakayama day 4 of 7. Kick back and take a break.,"This morning marks the first hours of the middle of my trip. As I try to pack light but not too light to where I stink, I have to do laundry every 4th day, and thats fine because my whole body is sore at this point. You realize 52 years of wild living really catch up quick when everything starts becoming painful. So today is a down day. Still a little riding, probably to the beach for a stroll, maybe go eat some Dolphin in Taiji because when in Rome or whatever. Also a good day to explore the village and the river. When riding I try to snap a couple pics just to share with folks, but I almost never want to stop except for gas, coffee and a piss anymore. I used to take 5x the snaps but only get half as far. So yesterday's ride was estimated to take 5 hours 50 something minutes, but ended up taking 8, not so much because of stopping, but mostly because some of the rindos were actually pretty sketchy dirt and gravel tracks with huge drop offs, so I had to keep the speed low and controlled in those parts, but it was only prob about 35kms of the entire trip, but I watched the arrival time grow steadily. But man, the rest of the roads. TOP TIER. some mentions 168, Ryujin Skyline, 311 and many more I cant remember off hand. A mix of giant elevations and views, super long and fast high triple digit sweepers that went on forever and fast tight twisty rollercoaster technical excitement. Lots of really nice bikes out as well, and I rode with a couple riders for a bit that eventually left me in the dust. Absolute madman on ""street legal"" race machines. But as fun as it was, it was one hell of a workout, especially having already been on the road 3 days. Welp, here's a couple pics from yesterday and a couple from today around the house with tons of these giant furry puppy moths that dont mind hanging out. Until tomorrow, cheers.

1oz3ylw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1oz3ylw/the_ultimate_guide_to_looking_expensive_thinking/,The ultimate guide to looking expensive & thinking sharper (without going broke or burning out),"It’s wild how many people seem put together from the outside but secretly feel like they’re scrambling inside, mentally foggy, overwhelmed, financially stuck, and unsure how to “level up.” Everywhere you scroll, it’s some TikTok “hot girl routine” or a guy selling you a $300 skincare serum. And don’t get me started on the hustle bros yelling at you to read 52 books a year and wake up at 5 AM.

But here’s the truth most of those influencers won't say: *Looking expensive and thinking clearly is not about money or genetics.* It's about small, consistently smart choices. These things *can* be learned, trained, and improved. The goal of this post is to share what actually works, from trusted books, cognitive science, and long-form podcasts that have done the real work. And yeah, you don’t need to drain your wallet or turn into a robot to do it.

Here's the compiled masterlist (based on real sources & expert strategies) to help you glow up your look *and* your brain.

---

* **Upgrade your “look expensive” baseline: it's not designer, it's *coherence***
  * *Fashion psychologist Dr. Dawnn Karen* explains in her book *“Dress Your Best Life”* that “enclothed cognition” is real—what you wear affects your confidence and cognitive state. Consistency in style beats flashy trends. 
    * Stick to a basic color palette (black, white, camel, navy, olive). You’ll look intentional, not loud.
    * Invest in tailoring over trends. A $40 blazer that fits well beats a $400 one that doesn’t.
    * Prioritize texture and fit: linen, wool, satin, structured cotton signal “polished” more than prints or logos.
  * Avoid over-accessorizing. Subtle accents (a clean watch, one piece of jewelry) give “quiet luxury” vibes without trying too hard.
  * Hair and skin matter more than anything you wear. Not because of beauty standards, but because they signal health and self-respect. A 2022 paper in *Frontiers in Psychology* linked perceived skin health to higher trustworthiness and attractiveness.

---

* **Sharpen your thinking by doing *less* of the wrong things**
  * You don’t need to read 50 books a year. You need to *understand and apply* a few key ones.
    * Start with *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, which proves from cognitive science that shallow tasks (scrolling, multitasking) are killing our brainpower.
    * Practice “time blocking” like Newport recommends. Just 90 minutes of truly focused work a day boosts your output more than 8 hours of hopping between Slack and tabs.
  * Ditch the mental junk food. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks it down: TikTok and fast-cut video weaken your dopamine system. This makes real focus feel boring and frustrating.
    * Instead, add *high-friction content* to your daily diet: long articles, audiobooks, or interviews where someone speaks in full, complex thoughts.
    * Huberman recommends daily “walk and listen” sessions, go outside with a podcast like *The Knowledge Project* or *Lex Fridman*. This recruits your visual and prefrontal cortex while calming the limbic system.

---

* **Build expensive *energy* that people can feel when you walk in**
  * Amelia Nagoski, co-author of *Burnout*, explains that how we *complete* Stress cycles matters more than how much stress we have. Unfinished stress dulls your glow, mentally and physically.
    * Move your body every day, not for weight loss, but for emotional hygiene. A 20-min walk, dance break, or light lifting counts.
    * Breathwork is not woo-woo. Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Judson Brewer explains how *long exhales* deactivate panic signals in the brain. Try his “4-7-8” or “box breathing” to reset between tasks.
  * Hydration, light, and blood sugar crashes are behind much of our low energy. Stanford’s Dr. Stacy Sims found in her research that just 1% dehydration can cut cognitive performance by 12%.
    * Start the day with salty lemon water (not coffee), get sunlight outside before 10am, and eat *protein first* each meal.

---

* **Curate your information diet like you're curating your outfit**
  * Read what *makes you sharper*, not what’s popular. The team behind Farnam Street (a mental models site) says most people consume “low signal” info, hey scroll things that have no long-term value.
    * Try these:  
      * *The Art of Thinking Clearly* by Rolf Dobelli  
      * *Atomic Habits* by James Clear  
      * *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel  
    * Just 20 pages per day = 30+ books per year passively.
  * Use Perplexity or ChatGPT to summarize deep academic insights so you don’t drown in PDFs. These tools are your cheat codes for complex learning.

---

* **Silence is a luxury now. Use it.**
  * Naval Ravikant said, “The ability to stay calm under stress is what separates the ‘expensive mind’ from the cheap one.”  
  * Build silent doses into your routine. Mute your phone for an hour. Drive without music. Sit with your thoughts. This isn’t meditation. It’s mental weightlifting.
  * Think in questions. “What would this look like if it were easy?” or “What am I assuming here?” Powerful thinkers aren’t smarter, they’re *better at stopping to ask*.

---

* **Bonus: the invisible “luxury” mindset habits people actually notice**
  * Speak slowly, pause often. Fast talking signals insecurity. Calm speech signals power.
  * Ask better questions than anyone else. “What’s something you learned recently that blew your mind?” is a stronger social signal than any outfit.
  * Keep posture tall but relaxed. Biomechanics expert Dr. Joan Vernikos (NASA) found posture influences brain activity as much as mood. Shoulders back = thoughts sharper.

---

None of this is magic. Looking expensive and thinking sharper isn’t about making money or going viral. It’s about subtle effort, done over and over till it becomes your baseline. Ignore the 12-step skincare threads. Skip the $400 courses. Real value comes from how you think, move, speak, and spend your energy when no one is watching.",2,1763344878.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

I was a lawyer who specializes in handling cases about cheating and dissolving mate bonds. Never had I imagined I’d be the one being “challenged” by the mistress.

Just moments ago, I received a mind link from my Alpha mate, Nathan Foster, “Babe, how’s your day going?”

The next moment, his “fiancée” walked into my law firm.

She was breathless with excitement, feigning coyness as she said, “I’d like to hire you to help me terminate my fiancé’s mate bond. He says his mate is a complete shrew, so we’d better show her some respect.”

I glanced at the intake form.

Client name: Nathan Foster.

There was a photo attached to the file, the same face I’d seen every morning for the past nine years.

But now? He felt like a stranger to me.

Oh, how ironic. I’ve been a lawyer in this regard for five years, helping to break up countless mate bonds.

And today, the tables have turned.

Congratulations, Nathan. You’ve just handed the one lawyer in New York who will make you regret everything over to your mistress.

… I closed the file and looked up at the shewolf sitting across from me.

She wasn’t stunning, maybe just pretty. She had a petite frame, the kind only a shewolf who’s never had pups could have, delicate and slender.

She spoke with grace, clearly well-mannered, but there was a certain naïve purity to her, suggesting she had lived a sheltered life.

When she mentioned her “promotion,” I caught a flicker of smugness in her eyes, but also a hint of nervousness.

“Ms. Brooks, so… what do you think we should do?”

“My fiancé wants his partner to quietly step aside. You know, to avoid ruining the old relationship. He doesn’t want to cause trouble,” she said softly, her lips curling into a shy smile.

If I didn’t know for sure that she had no idea who I was, I’d think she was mocking me.

I forced a professional smile. “Ms. Ross, how long have you two been together?”

She blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

I slowed my pace, speaking deliberately.

“Before I can offer you legal advice, I need to understand every detail of your relationship.”

“Oh! Okay.” She nodded, her voice becoming soft and dreamy.

But with each word she spoke, my smile grew colder.

“We’ve been together for two years. We met at a charity gala.”

“His family had just learned that someone had been diagnosed with a serious illness. He was really down, standing alone on the terrace. I just happened to pass by, and we… talked for a while…”

Her cheeks flushed lightly.

“We hit it off right away. Less than a month later, we started officially dating.”

Listening to her sweet little love story, my chest tightened, like someone had gripped it in a fist.

“Did you see him two years ago, on this day?”

“Wait, how do you know that?” Her eyes widened in surprise.

I gave a slight smile, my eyelashes hiding the frost in my gaze.

Of course I knew. Since two years ago today, my father suffered a severe heart attack. He passed in the emergency room at NYE (New York Elders) Pack Hospital.

At the same time they “met,” I had been kneeling outside the emergency room, broken. I screamed and cried until my throat was raw.

Old wounds tore open again, the pain cutting deep, again and again.

I took a deep breath and moved on to the next question.

“Did you know he has a four-year-old son? He just started kindergarten.”

“Oh, yes,” she said, her shy demeanor instantly replaced with utter confidence.

“He promised me that after we bonded, I would be Marcus’s mother. Anyway, little pups don’t remember anything. The werewolves who love them are their real parents,” she said, looking at me, seeking my approval.

“Don’t you agree, Ms. Brooks?”

I clenched my hands so hard knuckles turned white, but I kept my expression calm.

“Of course. You’re absolutely right.”

Too bad you’d never get the chance.

She completely relaxed, letting her guard down. She continued, speaking almost cheerfully.

“He even showed me pictures of his mate. She had a C-section scar on her belly, looking deep and ugly. He says every time he sees it, he feels disgusted.”

She chuckled lightly. “Ms. Brooks, don’t you think that shewolf is pathetic? Why is she so obsessed? How desperate must she be?”

I smiled too, my gaze stiff.

“Have you considered the possibility that his mate has no idea he’s been cheating?”

Chapter 2

“Impossible!” Amelia’s voice was sharp and absolute.

“Nathan can’t even stand to touch her. Unless she’s out of her mind, she couldn’t miss it. With me? He’s passionate, desperate. But with that ordinary shewolf at home? He says he feels suffocated.”

“Ms. Brooks, seriously, wouldn’t you find it strange that you haven’t had sex in two years?”

“I would,” I blurted out, but my gaze was fixed on the Cartier mate bond ring on my finger.

Nathan and I came from different packs, but at 18, we met at the same Lycan training camp. The moment we met, our wolves recognized each other.

We trained together, fought side by side, and when we won first place in the Lycan Training Competition, he confessed his love, and I said yes without hesitation.

We’ve been lovers, then bonded mates for nine years.

When I had pneumonia, he drove three hundred miles through a snowstorm in the middle of the night just to bring me medicine.

When I was upset, he would scour all of Manhattan just to find my favorite bakery.

When I was pregnant and gave birth, he never missed a single checkup.

Every time he came home, he would hug both Marcus and me and tell us we were the best parts of his life.

Even when we stopped sleeping in the same bed two years ago, he explained it gently.

“Baby, giving birth to Marcus wrecked your body. I can’t let you go through that again.”

I thought that once the passion faded, the mate bond would settle into gentle, stable love.

I never thought he’d seek gratification elsewhere.

A chill rushed through me, straight to my chest. I forced out the last question.

“So, you just want her to propose the dissolution of the mate bond? Just like that?”

“No,” she shook her head forcefully.

“The most important thing is, his mate can’t find out he’s been cheating. Yes, she helped Nathan achieve once, but his current success is all his own. If she finds out, she’ll ruin him!”

“Ms. Brooks, you’re New York’s best at dissolving mate bonds. Our future is in your hands.”

I smiled and nodded. “Don’t worry.”

As soon as she left, I called my partner, Owen Grant.

“Owen, I need our top private investigator and forensic accountant. Right now! I want Nathan’s financial transactions and travel records from the last two years.”

“Oh, and tell my uncle, the fund Nathan manages? It’s time to pull out our investments.”

“I wanna see if he can survive without me.”

Owen was my golden partner for one simple reason—his efficiency was unmatched.

A few hours later, a 256GB encrypted hard drive was on my desk.

“Everything you wanted is in there.”

I plugged it in and clicked open.

The first video: On a private yacht, Nathan, wearing a white linen shirt, gentlemanly put a Graff diamond necklace around Amelia’s neck.

On my birthday last month, Nathan said he had an urgent meeting at work. When he came home, he only brought me a wilting carnation he bought from the street.

The second video: At a department store, Nathan had his arm around Amelia’s waist, and they were casually strolling through a luxury boutique.

Clothes, handbags, shoes—shopping bags piled up around Amelia’s feet. Their intimacy was almost palpable through the screen.

At checkout, the clerk gave them a music box as a free gift. He handed it to Marcus later, telling him, “This is something Daddy picked out for you.”

I closed the folder without expression and opened the next one.

Nathan’s offshore accounts showed several large transfers, all labeled as “investment consulting fees”. All funds ultimately went into an account ending in 3308.

Account holder: Amelia Ross.

Such a clumsy attempt to hide assets. Did he really think I’d never find out?

The final file made my blood run cold, which was a chat record from Marcus’s kindergarten teacher.

Amelia had been posing as “Marcus’s aunt,” constantly inquiring about his daily routine. She had even replied to the invitation for the parent-teacher meeting next week!

My hand tightened around the mouse.

I couldn’t accept this. Nathan’s betrayal had already quietly seeped into our son’s life.

When Marcus was born, Nathan awkwardly cradled the tiny life in his arms, vowing to cherish him forever.

Just moments ago, when Amelia said she wanted custody of the pup, I still held onto a sliver of hope, believing that at least Nathan loved our son, that even if we dissolved the mate bond, at least he wouldn’t hurt him.

I was wrong.

Chapter 3

My chest felt like it had been carved open with a silver knife, a vast gash letting frigid winds howl through.

My wolf whimpered in pain. I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed my phone, preparing to warn Nathan to stay away from my son.

But my phone buzzed first—it was a message from Amelia.

She sent me a photo of herself, asking for my opinion.

[Ms. Brooks, what do you think of this outfit? Nathan is taking me and Marcus to meet his parents tonight. I’m so nervous.]

Almost at the same time, Nathan’s message came through:

[Baby, Mom and Dad miss Marcus. I’m taking him to the Blackveil estate tonight. You’ve been working so hard lately, so I’ve booked you a spa treatment at the Hopston Hotel. Go relax a bit.]

Looking at the innocent face of my son in the photo, I smiled faintly.

A spa? That was nothing compared to this family dinner show.

Since it was meeting the parents, of course the real mate should be there to oversee. I hung up the phone and immediately drove straight to Blackveil Pack.

Along the way, Nathan’s messages kept popping up. [Baby, have you arrived yet? The main road’s blocked. Is everything okay?] He was tracking my location.

I calmly searched for a random photo of a spa center online and sent it to him.

[Just arrived. It’s a nice place.] My reply was short, but he seemed satisfied.

[Enjoy yourself. Love you.] Same old sweet talk. It made me sick now.

I put my phone in my pocket, ignoring the rest of his messages.

When I got there, I parked the car, put on my sunglasses, and slipped in through the side door. Dinner hadn’t started yet, but most of the relatives from Blackveil Pack had arrived.

Nathan’s mother, Stephanie, was bustling between the kitchen and the living room, her smile never fading. That warm, caring vibe was just like how she’d shown me years ago.

Back then, when I was exhausted weekly, she’d bring me warm soup at my office. When I was cold, she’d knit me scarves and slippers, taking better care of me than her own son. She even remembered my father’s back pain and arranged for a masseur to help relieve that.

My father, who was discerning, once told me, “Nathan’s parents seem great. I’m not worrying about you marrying into Blackveil Pack now.”

Now, when Amelia and Nathan walked in, she was the first to greet them.

“You must be Amelia! So pretty! I bet you’ll bring more lovely pups to our family.”

“Nathan, if you dare mistreat this girl…”

Nathan’s father, Edward, who was usually reserved, set down his coffee and patted Nathan’s shoulder contently.

“Nathan, you’ve got great taste. We could finally have more boys in this family.”

Suddenly, it hit me, so they were mad at me just because I had only given them one pup. How ironic, it was Nathan who refused to have more pups.

Amelia straightened proudly, her voice sweet as honey. “Don’t worry, Edward, Stephanie. Nathan took me to get checked. The healer says I’ll probably have a boy.”

“That’s wonderful! Truly wonderful!” His parents beamed, while my son stood alone in the corner, forgotten.

Relatives gathered around, showering her with praise.

My cousin, who I loaned $150,000? “Nathan, you’re a legend!”

The aunt whose son I got into a study abroad program? In tears. “Amelia’s such a sweetheart!”

The cousin I saved from his failed business venture? Raising a glass. “To this happy couple!”

Each one of them had benefitted from my help. Now, not one of them remembered my name.

My aunt wiped away her tears, then excitedly grabbed my four-year-old son and pushed him toward Amelia. “Go on, call her mom!”

Stephanie chimed in at once, pulling Marcus’s hand into Amelia’s. “Marcus. Call her mom!”

Marcus staggered back in fear. “No! She’s not my mom! My mom is Natalie!”

Stephanie’s face twisted with anger as she pinched his arm hard. “Stop saying that! This is your new mom!”

Edward glared at him coldly. “Nathan, is this how you raise your son? No manners whatsoever!”

Amelia pouted, snuggling closer to Nathan. “Nathan… does Marcus hate me?”

Nathan tightened his hold on her, his voice soothing and gentle.

“Of course not. He’s just a pup. He doesn’t know better. Once we’ve bonded, all the discipline is up to you. I won’t interfere.”

I stood outside the room, watching this absurd scene unfold. Finally, I couldn’t stand it any longer.

So I pushed the door open. Everyone’s expression froze as I smiled blandly, “Family dinner? Funny. How come no one told me?”",2,1763344764.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

First in rained and then the cold turned it to sleet that felt like a sharp slap to the face. I only went out once to put some sunflower seeds on the porch steps for a squirrel. He and the birds are enjoying the feeder immensely. A of the wonderful winter birds have finally graced us with their presence; the chickadees, the juncos, the warblers, and this adorable cardinal couple we see all year long. They are the sweetest things. The squirrel is also a lovely sight but he does have a bad habit of knocking the feeder crocked and with all the wind and snow, I did not want to go out there several times a day to fix it. I left a few piles of seed on the ground for it but I can't say for sure weather the squirrel got a nibble before the snow covered it.

Anyway, both mother and I woke up feeling less than great. Not sick, but certainly uncomfortable. Alas, the chores don't disappear just because your health does. The laundry still needed to be done and the basement still needed to be cleaned up. The clean up was easier than I expected at least; Father helped too. He has been more active in the house upkeep now that he doesn't work.

Good news, I wrote last night. Not a large amount but I did my best. I wrote 431 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. How I wanted to present certain elements was a struggle to me; if I had a clearer idea of how I wanted to do things, I think I could have managed at least 500. Oh well, 431 is always better than 0. I want to write tonight but I also don't want to do anything. I am still feeling a little off. But, on the other hand, I have finally figured out how I want to write the next part of the scene and I'd like to get it written. I'm not sure which impulse will win out in the end.

A warm coffee and a cookie will surely help me decide. Here's hoping I make good choices.

If you would like to participate in climbing the corporate ladder, check out our [previous Reddit post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1olvbdm/satisfactory_community_we_are_live_for_everyone/)

**Some cool facts about this event:**

\- The entire tower was built in one month. 

\- This event and the tower itself are both completely community made. Regular players like you answered a Reddit post 6 weeks ago and thought this sounded like a fun idea.

\- Over 100 people contributed to this project in at least some small way, and the team of folks who actively worked on this tower is made up of about 50 Satisfactory players. 

\- The tower has over 18,000 signs (which is why performance is a bit choppy for first two minutes while they all load in). 

\- The entire tower is made up of vanilla buildables. Some level creators used infinite nudge and infinite zoop for convenience, though most did not. The least vanilla thing about the tower is the event mod we use to track scores, provide carts, and prevent cheating. 

\- Over 10,000 falls have happened from the tower... so far. More to come. 

\- The current team needs a break and Coffee *cup* Studios is looking for some fresh blood to do the Ficsmas project we have planned. The first part of the Ficsmas project aims to include and to benefit console players. The second part will be a downhill sledding mountain for PC only. ",58,1763344570.0,SatisfactoryGame,0,1.0,False

Repeating his printed words over and over again to make sense of it all. ""The best dad in the world"" with a big red heart at the end, a gift from my daughter. It always reminds me of those simpler times in quotes when I didn't have to deal with her bullying in the principal's office regularly, when she was still little and didn't know she was a little different from the others. Unfortunately, time is relentless and puts a person to various tests, whether we like it or not. For a while I was still stuck in my longing for the past, looking at the reflection in the surface of my stimulant drink. I was pulled out of it only by a gentle tap on my shoulder.

I turned around and saw the face of a person to whom I have been dedicating my precious time for several years, and also a fake smile, just to feed my family.

\- Hi, sorry to bother you at the end of my shift, but I have a small request, could you work overtime today? We need to have this page programmed as soon as possible, specifically within a week. Let's call it a turnaround week, what do you say? -

\- Overtime? But I've worked overtime several times this month. Do you really not have any replacement today? I'm working on it as best I can. -

\- Unfortunately not, you're the only available candidate, the colleague next door already has something. -

\- Like, does he have something? Do you know what I have? Picking up my disabled daughter from school because my wife can't today. Plus, you haven't even paid me for the past overtime yet. -

\- You know, I'm not the one who needs a place here, and there would definitely be someone interested. -

All the anger I had felt for this scoundrel over the years began to accumulate in me and this time he spoke out forcefully. 

\- That's enough, I've been your slave here long enough to deserve better treatment, I'm not some piece of rag that you can throw away and exchange for another. -

He smiled at me and said.

\- Well, unfortunately, you're stupid, and so are everyone who doesn't try hard enough for their superior, this is how corporations work, and corporations won't change just because you have a disabled daughter. -

At that moment, I wanted to punch him in the eyes, but in the end I told myself that I didn't want to sink to the same level of hyenism as this dickhead and so I just grabbed my mug, car keys, wallet and got up, leaving my office corner. along with the remnants of my dignity. On the way, I still managed to spill my coffee on the carpet, which provoked my boss.

\- Hey! Where do you think you're going?! You haven't even finished your contract. - Which I just dismissed with a sentence.

""I'll send you an email, I hope another idiot who works for you checks it for you.""

I got in the car, and I was wondering if I had just screwed up when my phone vibrated in my pocket. My daughter texted me.

\- Hey, are you on your way yet? -

\- Yeah, I should be there in about 10 minutes. Just wait by the driveway. -

\- Okay. -

 

Damn, I thought to myself as I worked out how I was going to explain this to her and my wife. I'm a person who probably values my time too much, how could I not when it's so limited. I was approaching the school and saw her drooping head, slowly lifting up to the nose of my car. I helped her put her crutches in the trunk. She got in without saying hello, and I sensed that she probably wasn't bringing good news, so I turned on the radio to ease the tension a bit.

\- So how was school? Did something happen? -

\- Nothing happened at all, I think that's the problem here. -

\- What do you mean nothing happened? -

\- I mean I'm still the same disabled idiot I am every day. -

\- Did you get bullied again today? -

\- Have you forgotten why I want to take you home every day by car and not by bus? Just so I don't have to see their crooked faces every time I sit there. -

\- Look, I know this new school is hard for you, but mom and I have our worries too, we have to try. -

 

I said, but she just left me in awkward silence. We finally got home, I waited for her to go inside to get my work stuff out of the trunk. I dodged my wife who was humming something in the kitchen and then I heard my daughter slam the door loudly in a fit of emotion.

\- Dinner! -

My wife called as I shoved the box into my cupboard and walked so carefully to the dining table.

\- Why didn't you even say hello to me? I didn't even see you coming. -

\- We see each other almost every day, we don't have to say hello all the time. -

\- Yeah, sure...- She replied, offended, but her words were somehow strangely slurred. I looked at her and saw an expression that explained everything. She was drunk and today for a change she wasn't trying to hide it.

\- She said I didn't have to get you anything on the black market anymore, that you could do it without anything, including the fucking alcohol! - I wanted to continue, but I saw my daughter coming to the table, so I had to be more discreet.""

\- Are you drunk again? I thought you'd had enough of the constant complaining from the neighbors. -

\- You've had enough of their bullshit. -

\- Hey, I called about your rehab and the price seems fine to me, you could leave on Monday. -

\- I don't care about money, I just don't feel like it. -

\- Of course you don't care about money when I'm taking all this money from my salary while I lie to everyone so they don't think of you as a lazy bum who fills his empty schedule with alcohol. -

\- So what? You keep going out into the woods shooting with your stupid rifle like some idiot. -

\- That's called a hobby, and I have permission to do it. - 

\- I have permission to buy a bottle, why else would they sell it in the store? -

\- Can you guys stop arguing?! -

\- Be quiet and eat before it gets cold. -

\- I don't think I'm hungry for this food anymore. -

\- Is she that stubborn after you or what? -

\- Why me? We're both tired, so calm down. -

\- Well, maybe she's disabled because of me, but she's definitely not stubborn and stupid. -

My pupils dilated and remained still as her last sentence echoed into the already rotten atmosphere and I realized that this wasn't going to look good, my daughter's confused and flustered expression convinced me as I glanced at her for a second and then quickly looked away.

\- What did you say? -

\- Can't you hear that or what? I said you're disabled because of me. I should have told you a long time ago but I guess the right time never came... well, now it's here. -

\- Please, mom doesn't know what she's saying, she's just drunk, look at her. - I laughed nervously, trying desperately to save the situation.

\- Go on! - She screamed until I flinched and dropped my cutlery. Then I kicked my wife lightly with my foot to signal her to end it while she still could, but the alcohol had already taken its toll.

\- Before you were born, I was addicted to hard drugs... and I took them for 9 months because I couldn't stop. Dad didn't know about it until it was too late... and then we found out. At first, there were no complications with your body until you were 5 years old, when you were diagnosed with Parkinson's, as you know. I told my dad and we almost got divorced. The only thing that kept us together was you, and we agreed to keep it a secret for your sake. I think you're old enough to know the truth...-

I explored the wooden texture of the table, digging my nails into the gaps to release the accumulated stress. I thought my daughter would cry loudly or something, but instead she just sat there, expressionless, eyes closed, fists clenched, but one tear finally gave up and started rolling down her soft red face. Then she stood up abruptly from her chair, spilling her glass of water on the tablecloth, grabbed her crutches, and headed for the room.

\- Honey, we're so sorry, but it was because of... - I didn't even get to finish my sentence before my daughter interrupted me.

\- I wish you a lifetime of suffering from head to toe, just like you wished for me. - She said through clenched teeth.

I rubbed my sweaty hands together and tried to blame anything but myself. My daughter's puberty, the alcohol my wife drank today, or her own lie that I finally agreed to, but the guilt still fell on me.

\- Why do you have that mug here? I thought you were using it at work. - My wife snapped me out of my deep trance. Damn, I'm an idiot, I accidentally took it out of the box when she called me for dinner. But I was so down that I just went out with the truth.

\- I left...I didn't have the nerve to do it anymore so...I'm currently unemployed. -

She stood up and slowly walked to the fridge where she took out a half-drunk bottle of wine, which she took to the bedroom, looking at the label. Somewhere around 11 hours after my self-pity session, I decided to go to bed. I leaned over my wife to hug her, but she instantly pushed me back coldly. I knew she wasn't sleepwalking, she was wide awake, just her eyes closed. I turned on my back and stared at the ceiling, I heard soft footsteps in the hallway, my daughter must have gone to brush her teeth, I smiled...I ignored it and watched the high beams shining through the curtains and then decided...that I was going to kill myself today. I couldn't live like this anymore, I hated this dysfunctional family. She was going to leave me anyway, I know she's been cheating on me for a while from her phone that she once left unlocked, her lover is seeing my daughter, she's moving in with him and I'm going to stay in this house that I have written to myself, until I run out of money for expenses, all by myself. No, I will never let that happen, I don't want to watch this ungrateful junkie get the upper hand, the junkie who made my daughter disabled, who made me have to buy drugs online so she wouldn't have withdrawals, I don't care about her promises, that she's strong enough this time. I got up, slowly put on my night slippers, and quietly walked to my office, while my wife was already fast asleep. My legs were shaking with terror as I kept reminding myself of what I was about to do, at the same time I felt sorry for her...well at least I'll spare her the panic and do it in the woods, far from the house. I took the key from my drawer and unlocked my safe to reach for my hunting shotgun...but I couldn't feel anything, it wasn't there. Suddenly I heard a scream.

\- Dad! Mom! - It came from her room.

I quickly ran down the hall, grabbed the handle, and opened her door. Then I was met with perhaps the worst sight I could ever see. My daughter, holding my sawed-off hunting shotgun in both hands, finger on the trigger, barrel stuck in her mouth. Her eyes locked intensely on mine, slightly glistening with tears that she couldn't hold back, just like me.

\- Honey...please...you don't have to do this...-

\- Put it down, okay? -

She just nodded her head slightly, made a soft sound, and then pulled the trigger, releasing a deafening thud that, along with my scream, resonated throughout the room. After that mere second when I finally opened my eyes, absolute terror set in. Her childhood stuffed animals, duvets and carpet were completely soaked with fresh blood, the light bulb burst from the shock wave, the sound of flowing fluid and its source that was forever etched in my memory. She sat there, fallen from the bed, holding the place where her jaw should be, but instead there was only a large hole. I was so shocked that it took me a while to react, but her deep sigh forced me to act. I caught her as she fell to the ground and held her tightly, stroking her hair and strangling her wound with a pillow so that she wouldn't bleed. At that moment, my wife came running, stopped in the doorway and started screaming. I told her to shut up and call an ambulance, which she finally did despite her hysteria. It felt like an eternity before they arrived and I could finally hand over my misfortune and burden to someone else. Of course, the police also arrived, who suspected us of murder, but in the end, our innocence was proven.

A week has passed since then. My wife left, I don't know exactly where she is right now, but I probably know who she's with. I couldn't even pay my daughter's hospital bills, so I had to think, think about what to do next. I kept asking myself...why her? Why couldn't it have been me? Why didn't I hide the key longer? Did she know it was there? Did she want me to see her shoot herself on purpose, and that's why she screamed? Did she really hate me that much? It was a rush of questions, but I had no answers. The only thing I could do now was do what I could. I sat down in my office at my computer, holding her mug in my hand.

\- Life is so fragile...life is so beautiful...so sad...but never predictable. -

\- Everyone should get another chance, to prevent mistakes like hers. -

Repeating his printed words over and over again to make sense of it all. ""The best dad in the world"" with a big red heart at the end, a gift from my daughter. It always reminds me of those simpler times in quotes when I didn't have to deal with her bullying in the principal's office regularly, when she was still little and didn't know she was a little different from the others. Unfortunately, time is relentless and puts a person to various tests, whether we like it or not. For a while I was still stuck in my longing for the past, looking at the reflection in the surface of my stimulant drink. I was pulled out of it only by a gentle tap on my shoulder.

I turned around and saw the face of a person to whom I have been dedicating my precious time for several years, and also a fake smile, just to feed my family.

\- Hi, sorry to bother you at the end of my shift, but I have a small request, could you work overtime today? We need to have this page programmed as soon as possible, specifically within a week. Let's call it a turnaround week, what do you say? -

\- Overtime? But I've worked overtime several times this month. Do you really not have any replacement today? I'm working on it as best I can. -

\- Unfortunately not, you're the only available candidate, the colleague next door already has something. -

\- Like, does he have something? Do you know what I have? Picking up my disabled daughter from school because my wife can't today. Plus, you haven't even paid me for the past overtime yet. -

\- You know, I'm not the one who needs a place here, and there would definitely be someone interested. -

All the anger I had felt for this scoundrel over the years began to accumulate in me and this time he spoke out forcefully. 

\- That's enough, I've been your slave here long enough to deserve better treatment, I'm not some piece of rag that you can throw away and exchange for another. -

He smiled at me and said.

\- Well, unfortunately, you're stupid, and so are everyone who doesn't try hard enough for their superior, this is how corporations work, and corporations won't change just because you have a disabled daughter. -

At that moment, I wanted to punch him in the eyes, but in the end I told myself that I didn't want to sink to the same level of hyenism as this dickhead and so I just grabbed my mug, car keys, wallet and got up, leaving my office corner. along with the remnants of my dignity. On the way, I still managed to spill my coffee on the carpet, which provoked my boss.

\- Hey! Where do you think you're going?! You haven't even finished your contract. - Which I just dismissed with a sentence.

""I'll send you an email, I hope another idiot who works for you checks it for you.""

I got in the car, and I was wondering if I had just screwed up when my phone vibrated in my pocket. My daughter texted me.

\- Hey, are you on your way yet? -

\- Yeah, I should be there in about 10 minutes. Just wait by the driveway. -

\- Okay. -

 

Damn, I thought to myself as I worked out how I was going to explain this to her and my wife. I'm a person who probably values my time too much, how could I not when it's so limited. I was approaching the school and saw her drooping head, slowly lifting up to the nose of my car. I helped her put her crutches in the trunk. She got in without saying hello, and I sensed that she probably wasn't bringing good news, so I turned on the radio to ease the tension a bit.

\- So how was school? Did something happen? -

\- Nothing happened at all, I think that's the problem here. -

\- What do you mean nothing happened? -

\- I mean I'm still the same disabled idiot I am every day. -

\- Did you get bullied again today? -

\- Have you forgotten why I want to take you home every day by car and not by bus? Just so I don't have to see their crooked faces every time I sit there. -

\- Look, I know this new school is hard for you, but mom and I have our worries too, we have to try. -

 

I said, but she just left me in awkward silence. We finally got home, I waited for her to go inside to get my work stuff out of the trunk. I dodged my wife who was humming something in the kitchen and then I heard my daughter slam the door loudly in a fit of emotion.

\- Dinner! -

My wife called as I shoved the box into my cupboard and walked so carefully to the dining table.

\- Why didn't you even say hello to me? I didn't even see you coming. -

This is a poem I feel in my bones. ""Feeling her head pick up her body,"" might be my favorite opening line since Luise Gluck's ""At the end of my suffering / there was a door."" And the way that it uses repetition is amazing: the rephrasing without saying the same thing reminds me a bit of Elizabeth Bishop's ""One Art"" in a way.

The first couple lines of the last stanza also strangely reminds me of Ezra Pound's ""The Lake Isle"" in that they are expressing similar sentiments, but from completely different perspectives. Pound comes from a place of privilege, while Taylor does not: she seems trapped.

This poem also reminds me a bit of William Bronk's ""Home Address"" (I've actually printed both and hung them next to each other on the wall - maybe I'll post that one next) but the connection is probably more in my head than it is on the page, still I feel like they talk to each other somehow.",2,1763343981.0,Poetry,2,1.0,False

I wanted to talk to him and I wanted to reach out to him so badly but I couldn’t in the beginning. I just couldn’t talk to him without feeling so upset. and he reached out to me and i’d reply back but it would hurt so much to talk to him. and then I eventually moved for a job and we started calling again and I felt a little bit better. I didn’t feel as hurt speaking to him so I thought I was OK and I was also actively speaking to another guy who I liked, but it ended up not working out and I’m not sure how to feel about everything. I’m still very upset but last night my ex FaceTime me and we were talking and he was severely drunk. I never saw him so drunk before and I was very concerned and so I just stayed on call and it seemed like he was going through some thing, and there was something on his mind, but he wasn’t saying what it was and eventually he asked, did you wanna hook up and I had suggested and said that we go up for coffee initially in the beginning, but I wasn’t opposed to it, but I think I was still very hesitant and then he asked me how many people have I been with since we broke up and I was honest I told him I’ve been with two people both didn’t work out and he kept on trying to dig for answers, but I just was telling him very vaguely it didn’t work out for their own respective reasons and then he said that he’s been with one girl and he’s still talking to her but not as much anymore and I said OK and then then at the end of the FaceTime, he said that he fucked the shit out of her and I was so disgusted and I hung up and I think that comment alone maybe go into a little bit of spiral I don’t know why I shouldn’t talk to him anymore and I haven’t texted or called him and he hasn’t done the same either since and I think it’s gonna stay that way but I’m not sure how to completely move on. I think maybe it was just a bad idea to start texting and calling him in the first place and so I’m hoping that with a few weeks and or maybe a couple of months, I will feel better but right now I don’t and I have a lot of friends and I hang out with my friends and I journal and I work out and I’m just not sure how to continue on and move past it when I still feel upset when I’m not even sure if he is upset either I feel stupid for feeling sad.",1,1763343807.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1oz3i4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/1oz3i4l/to_the_very_precious_person_who_handed_out_roses/,to the very precious person who handed out roses in uptown today ❤️,"thank you so much. for real. this absolutely made my day (and week, month, and season). 

I was sitting outside Maggie Miley's with my doggo when this kind human approached me and asked if I would like a rose. I said yes (after a surprised, ""oh my God, you're adorable"") and then you walked to the next table and gave the couple sitting there a rose as well. I followed you down the street as you continued to pass out single roses to folks. we chatted briefly and I asked if I could take a picture, to which you said yes. 

I asked you why you were handing out roses, and you said it was simply to spread some kindness. Thank you so much. ❤️  

To everyone else, we never know what people are going through, and the kindness I have found here in B-N is something I am deeply grateful for. 

(The backstory (that none of y'all asked for, oops) is that I moved here with my partner and all of our animals at the end of February. My partner died in a motorcycle accident in early June, and I have been really struggling mentally and emotionally. In addition to losing him, there are lots of issues with the house we bought, I hit a deer and totaled my car two weeks ago, and I have several personal/family things going on that have made life feel *really* tough recently... One of the things I did in late summer/early fall was to make flower arrangements from our gardens and give them away to folks in uptown (mostly restaurant/coffee shop staff)). 

Anyways, thank you so very much. Hope you have a lovely week. 

tldr: 
life is hard and kindness is a life-saver. all we have is each other - we're all we've got. be kind. ❤️

Always been that way. I was inspired to try IF, so I jumped right into an 18:6 window. Judge me if you wish, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're crazy like me, but in my case, it worked out. (For those concerned, I'm 27, no big health conditions, weigh about 180lbs, and I work out).

  
Day one sucked. I'm a night-time eater, normally I would eat a meal at midnight, snack until 3am. So, first night, only water, it was brutal. Following morning I was beyond starving. My hours are 2pm to 8pm for eating, so the MINUTE it hit 8pm, I feasted lol

  
Day two was slightly easier. Nighttime cravings were there, but not as severe. In the morning, I was hungry, but again, slightly easier. My feasting at 2pm was slightly less intense.

  
Day three (beginning that night) my cravings practically never happen. Minimal at most. In the morning, I wasn't hungry. It wasn't until 1:30ish that I got any cravings. However...

  
When I ate that day, I had some healthier yogurt, and a boost shake, and I was full. Like, completely full. Almost stomach ache level. No feasting, no sugar cravings at all. An hour or two later I had some apples slices, and I was full again. That night, no cravings at all.

  
Meanwhile:

On day 3, without even thinking about it (placebo) something felt off in my body. I quickly realized my knees were not aching like typical, especially in the morning. I work 12 hours shifts in an ER, and I did 18,000 steps that day, and my feet hurt only half as bad as typical, and my legs weren't even tired. Not only that, but my energy was WEIRDLY good all shift. I had 1/3rd the coffee I normally have in a 12 hour shift. I also didn't sleep the best leading into this shift. It was a little hard to believe but it was real lol.

  
I've never been so surprised by a health decision in my life. I've done multiple diets, fitness plans, etc. and this has been very eye-opening. I'm about to lock into this for the long-run now!

  
TLDR: In 3 days my cravings went away, my appetite shrunk, my sugar cravings dropped, my knee aches went away, my legs/feet hurt half as bad after 18,000 steps, and my energy increased.",2,1763343516.0,intermittentfasting,2,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

One of the search results came with the following, 

In medical language, “anorexia” means not wanting to eat. Adding “nervosa” to anorexia makes it a mental health condition.

It got me thinking. Frasier and Nile's favorite coffee shop is Cafe Nervosa. Both doctor's are psychiatrists who help people deal with mental conditions. 

It's kind of a weird connect between the coffee shop name and the medical condition.

My mom pairs us up, we send her our wishlists, and she forwards them to whoever got our name. Easy, right?

Except apparently not.

I’m not even claiming to be an amazing gift giver, but if someone says “I want this specific thing,” I will literally just… buy it. Because that’s the whole point of a wishlist?
The last two years I’ve given a super simple, very cheap list, everything under $25. And both years I’ve gotten nothing from it.
 
Instead it’s like my Santa just panic-stops at Dollar Tree and grabs whatever five random items are in arm’s reach. Zero thought. Zero effort.

Meanwhile I show up with actual gifts that match what people asked for. Last year I gave my person a cute mug, her favorite coffee, and a $50 Barnes & Noble gift card with a note saying we could go together. 
Maybe I went overboard, whatever. But then I open my gift and it’s:– a tacky gnome thing– a cheap dirty oven mitt– another random wooden “Live Laugh Love reject” decor piece

All stuff straight from the dollar store. And again, none of it was even close to anything on my list. They maybe spent $5 max.

So this year my husband (his first year in this chaos) and I decided we’re not doing it. We’re tapping out. We’re tired of feeling disappointed and pretending it’s fine.

I know people say “it’s the thought that counts,” but like… there actually has to BE some thought. 

Last year I did complain to my mom. And she told me to just be grateful. When she reached out this year to ask who was interested, I messaged her separately to see if we could do a minimum and a maximum amount (like min $25, max $50) She promptly said no, that people should be able to do what they can.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

I've never seen a setup like this. Essentially Tinman is a community coffee roaster, I believe people can pay to use their equipment and facilities. It's in an industrial area.  
  
**What sets Tinman apart is the fact that** ***they are not a cafe*****. You can't buy cups of coffee (something about council regs) and that's** ***amazing*****.**  
  
Instead, Ben, the awesome, as he shall now be known, will makes you anything you want and talk coffee for as long as you're there. We tried new roasts, we tried some from their freezer that were 3 years old. We talked pour-over techniques and equipment and generally geeked out. Someone wanted to try an espresso, he made one and poured a sample for everyone. He tried different pour-over gear.. it was the best coffee experience I've ever had. I bought beans and he even gave me a mystery tube from the freezer. :)

They have a great range of filter coffees and they were delicious.

I can't rant enough, if you're in Melbourne go give it a shot, I'd say Saturdays 9-12 are where its at as I'm not sure you'd get that much time if they were roasting!

I’m a secret rebel currently masquerading as a VP in tech aka corpo drone, constantly trying to get back at Bob Loblaws while figuring out how to get around this city with construction galore. Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, child free (obv), physically active partner who wants to live our DINKY life, have company for her dog walks and I dunno… nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Currently busy growing a mini jungle at home, adding to my Spotify playlist each week, already excited like a kid again with hockey season (damn you leafs 😭), playing random rec sports (floor hockey, beach volleyball etc) each week to stay active and sneaking in standup comedy/concerts (join me!) as much as possible. Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica plus a bunch of US spots for work so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

Two years ago, I (38m) got married to ‘Priscilla’ (46f), who I thought was the love of my life. Priscilla had been married before to ‘Darrell’ (46m) for over 20 years. Together they had 3 children, ‘Ruby’ (30f), ‘Jack’ (25m), and ‘Ilych ‘Lenin’ Ulyanov’ (15m) Lenin is a teen and has the most common name out of all of them, so I figured he’ll be the hardest to figure out this post is about him. 

Priscilla divorced Darrell due to repeated infidelity, gambling, alcoholism, and the fact that he’s a professional cock fighter. She then moved from Boston to Kentucky, where we met and now live. When we first met, it was like sparks flew, and I almost immediately asked her out. A month after we started dating, she and her kids moved in (she’s very close to her children, so they still live together). However, due to the fact that Lenin is still a teen, she constantly goes back to Boston for supervised visits. 

I’m actually quite jovial and a pretty good football player (could have gone pro but didn’t) so me and Lenin got very close. Because of that, one of the days we were at the park, Lenin informed me that his mom was actually dropping him off at his grandma’s, and using that time to instead go on dates with Darell. 

My heart immediately shattered. I had made so many sacrifices for Kate, and that’s how she repayed me?! Either way, I knew I couldn’t immediately ask for a divorce, and instead decided to hire a P.I. In order to take her down. 

I had never hired a p.i before, so I was unsure on what to expect. I got in contact with this lady, ‘Melody’ (30f) who mentioned living in my area. We went to meet at the local coffee shop (I told my wife I was going to go fishing) and, to my surprise, Melody ended up being Ruby. 

I was immediately taken aback. I didn’t know if I should run away or explain the situation to Ruby, but she gently held my hand and told me that she knew what had happened between her mother and me. Ruby looks quite a lot like her mother, except much younger and prettier. 

We then decided to continue with my plan, and I officially hired her as a p.i. Unfortunately, due to the fact that we had constantly hung out together, and my inability to find Kate attractive, I accidentally began an affair with Sophie.  

It’s now been six months since we began dating, and although we have not collected much information on the p.i side, I was still feeling much better. That was until last night, when Kate came back from the trip to Boston earlier, and found me and Sophie passionately making out in the couch.

I tried to calmly explain the situation to her, and she immediately started freaking out, as well as breaking everything around her. She even broke my prized fishing reel (an electric fishing reel, priced at around 3000 dollars. It was a gift from my great aunt.) Sophie tried to calm her mother, but Kate wouldn’t listen to her, and almost slapped her in the face, yelling about how she “destroyed her life”. I had never seen her like this before. 

This entire situation woke up Jack, who had not known about his mother or my affair. Thankfully, after we explained it to him, Stephen seemed to pick my side and Sophie’s over Kate. 

It turns out none of them like Darrell very much, and Stephen even chastised his mom after hearing the whole thing. He called her “a dumb hag” and said that “he couldn’t believe she was letting go of someone like me for a pos like Travis”. Safe to say, he and his mother are now not on speaking terms. 

It’s been a week since the entire situation, and Kate has been pressuring me to resolve this situation by 1. Kicking out Sophie, and 2. Doing couples’ therapy. She has also enlisted her whole family, and they have been blowing up my phone, calling me an asshole and all sort of names and telling me to “kick the witch out”. Stephen and Lenin have told me that they will support me either way.

do you support the new coffee place or stick with the old do you think people who pick the first option are justified in their choice morally and ethically  
(edit) so the old coffee shop has the questionable views and this is also a metaphor for piracy or fan content ",1,1763342285.0,teenagers,6,1.0,False
1oz31ol,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz31ol,"Vendor Recommendations & Recap: San Francisco, November 1, 2025","Hi fellow San Francisco wedding folks!! We recently had our wedding at the beginning of this month, and really loved our vendors and how the day came together. Almost all of them were from SF/Bay Area, with the exception of two (very wonderful) vendors. It was really important to us to hire vendors in our community because we live here and wanted our vendors to help us show off and celebrate the beauty of San Francisco.

We had an Indian-Filipino-American fusion wedding with about 150 guests! I felt strongly about having an autumn wedding, but before bar exam results were released (ha). We had the most stunning weekend. Sunny, not too hot, no fog (I love the fog but for the views, no fog was better).

My dresses were both from Monique Lhuillier - the welcome party dress (w/ cape) I bought at Bridal Galleria in SF, my main dress I bought at the ML flagship in New York.

  
**Planning:** Events by GS. We love Luciana & Masumi. They really were our rocks day-of and we were all emotional. Everything we wanted, they handled, and protected us from the small mishaps day-of. Glad to call them our friends now. 

**Photo:** Allison Stoddard (+ second shooter, Cammy Marie). Gosh Allison is so freaking talented and KIND. She actually zipped me into my dress because the zipper was being stubborn. We will treasure the art she created forever. I interviewed countless people (read: 20+ photographers in the Bay Area and beyond) but I felt at ease with Allison the minute I met her.

**Video**: McKenna Elsner. One of our vendors who came up from Los Angeles. Just adored her energy and I clicked with her better than anyone else I had spoken to up in the Bay.

**Content:** Molly Alison. Our other vendor who came up from Los Angeles. She has spent a lot of time in SF and came highly recommended to us, and she went above and beyond. Content was SO worth it. Being able to scroll through videos the next day was so special.

**Invitations & Day-of Paper:** Leah at CoffeeNCream Press in the Sunset. I cannot cannot cannot overstate how patient, creative, and fun Leah is. We had such a blast. Spent a lot of money, and it was all worth it. She even made me fake vintage-Muni-transfer-ticket-inspired save the dates for our flatlays because our actual save the dates were just not the vibe.

**Florist:** Amanda Vidmar Design (she also owns The Sidewalk Flowers in Cole Valley). So much love to Amanda and her team, who executed flawlessly, and also delivered me a bouquet and small gift a week later when they found out I passed the bar exam. GOOD PEOPLE! They are the epitome of community.

**Beauty + Hair:** Paula Maia Beauty. Paula and her team were really sweet, punctual, easy-going, flexible...it was a good morning.

**Custom Tuxedo (for my husband):** Tailors' Keep!!!!! We love the team there and the tuxedo came out gorgeous. So fun making the fabric and design choices with them and seeing their passion for suiting. 

**DJ:** DJ Ash! My husband felt strongly about hiring an Indian DJ and Ash was so flexible, attentive, and received many compliments from our guests! 

**Hotel:** Hotel Drisco on Pacific Avenue. Exceptional service and I am happy we stayed at a hotel even though we live in the City.

**Ceremony Venue:** SF City Hall. No notes, really stunning, we negotiated an extra ceremony-only hour with them which helped a ton.

**Reception Venue:** Fort Mason Gallery 308. We had a gloriously clear day - full views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Our guests loved it. Even with Renegade going on the same day and the general foot traffic, it felt private inside. 

**Welcome Party Venue + Bartending:** Pagan Idol. Team was really easy to work with and it allowed us to share the history of tiki bars in SF!

**Welcome Party Caterer:** The Sarap Shop Wonderful human beings making delicious Filipino fusion food. So many compliments from my Filipino relatives and non-Filipino guests alike.

**Favors/Wedding Day Dessert:** Miette. For candy and macarons! Working with their team for ordering and pickup was very smooth and they're really nice. 

**Wedding Cake:** Butter&. Such great gluten free cake!!! and they send you a photo preview the night before which was just so cute. 

**Wedding Caterer:** KT Productions/Chef Ken Tsang. Food was Asian-Fusion (Filipino x Indian x more) and we got a ton of compliments. Event manager Jen is a powerhouse and ran the show day-of.

**Bartending:** Twist of Lime. Day-of I have no complaints! The model is that they do the bartending/bring the equipment/etc., but you supply the alcohol. Theoretically this saves money, but I think in the end it didn't for us and we should have just gone with a bartending service that would have handled it for us. But that has nothing to do with the quality of ATOL day-of :) 

**Chai:** Kasa! All of my husband's family loved it, and they're pretty discerning about chai, so I was pleased. 

**Rentals:** BBJ La Tavola (linens), Theoni (linens), Standard Event Rentals (everything else). No complaints, and I definitely am happy we went with upgraded linens from BBJ La Tavola and Theoni!

**Saree Drapist:** Chhavi Bansal of Perfect Saree Draping! She draped my saree and my husband's dupatta on-site which was such a helpful service to have. 

**Transportation:** Epic Limo. Drivers were all really nice and handled the chaos of Fort Mason really well.

  
Other: 

**Custom Toile Artist:** Mayca.Illustrations on Instagram. She is based in the Philippines!

**Filipino Cord:** Sinta Co. on Etsy

**Custom Velvet Vow Books:** Abbey Ratcliff on Etsy

**Indian outfits:** bought in Mumbai!

**Powell St. Cable Car Cufflinks:** Etsy, my favorite find for my husband!",24,1763342265.0,SanFranciscoWeddings,10,1.0,False

Male preferred but totally not essential. I only prefer male because I learned Chinese from a girl and my pronunciation, I found out too late, was markedly 'cute'. Would rather sound masculine :) 

Ready to pay. I'm an artsy male, 26, looking to meet at a coffee shop/library/university/your preferred local to practice Romanian conversation. No need for credentials of any sort, just looking for conversation, your best tips/tricks, and aggressive pronunciation correction. 

Thanks!

their drink was finished so i put it up on our hand out bar. they had wondered off but came back, so i pointed it out and said “here’s your oat latte”. they didn’t react so i reached for the coffee to hand it to them and say “this one’s yours”

they very loudly said “honey im partially deaf you need to speak up”, obviously said sorry and that i didnt know. again loudly exclaiming said with attitude “that’s the thing… you never know and you cant tell”. i apologised again and they left

i genuinely thought nothing of the interaction and they didn’t do anything to make me think they were hard of hearing 😭 it was just a normal interaction until they got mad… i’m sorry i didn’t know to specifically speak louder just for you 

why do people take a perfectly fine interaction and turn it into something that it’s not 😭",8,1763342039.0,barista,9,0.83,False
