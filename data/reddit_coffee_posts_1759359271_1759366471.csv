1nvpt7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1nvpt7x/help_needed_sleeping_issues/,Help needed. Sleeping issues.,"Hello. Need suggestions on next steps to address sleeping issues.

Ive been on duloxetine 60mg for the past few months which helped my anxiety, and i would say it has greatly improved my outlook and definitely improved quality of life. 

However, sleep is still an issue. Its hard for me to “wind down.” While I have no issues getting from an awake to asleep state, parang hindi ko nararamdaman yung desire to climb into bed to prepare for sleep, if that makes sense. 

Sometimes i would take quetiapine (both meds are prescribed by a psych), but it would knock me out so much that im useless the day after. Nauseated and sleepy and generally not wanting to go to work.

Mornings are particularly challenging. I would get maybe a good 6hrs of sleep before i need to be up super early to manage my food business, id get up and have breakfast with coffee, but soon after i would feel like i need to sleep a little more. Id climb back to bed wanting to get a few more minutes, and those minutes can easily turn into a couple of hours. I dont feel any better after. Parang kulang na kulang pa rin.

Even if i sleep early, my sleep will get interrupted by my wanting to pee, or whatever. Basta magigising ako sa gitna ng gabi. I dont take coffee past 10am most days kasi nga ayaw ko na mahirapan makatulog, pero walang difference.

On my day off, i can easily rot in bed the entire day and still feel sluggish. 

Pag nasa work naman ako i can focus enough to get thru the day, and hindi naman ako super inaantok while working. Pero nandun yung feeling na i could be achieving so much more if i just had a good nights sleep. If i had just come to work on time. 

Ive seen a sleep doctor and was asked to take a sleep test. Pero pucha ang mahal. So pinagiipunan ko pa yon. Im scared tho na ill find out i have no sleep apnea and dead end na naman. What else is there to rule out?

Basta kulang ako sa tulog and i dont know what to do.

1nvpsrj,https://i.redd.it/oxi6bchzilsf1.jpeg,Oil change tomorrow. Anyone look forward to the WV dealer waiting room?,"Getting my yearly oil change tomorrow (2019 SEL V6 AWD). My vehicle is outside warranty coverage, I’m okay with that.

My dealer is a combined Volkswagen / Audi but each side is its own, with the service bay entrances in the middle. I own one of each, so I kind of know everyone.

I really like our VW waiting room. The chairs are actually comfortable and they have a kiddo table with crayons and etc (mine will be in school, so won’t be needing, but I like that). 

They have a fridge with water, Gatorade minis, and a coffee/espresso machine that works. It works! 😅

I get a break from everything else going on and kind of zone off into YouTube shorts (earplugs) or stream whatever.

Anyone else kind of look forward to a little break during oil changes, or like their dealer waiting room? I keep going back because they treat us well, and I trust the service. 

It would suck if I wasn’t able to trust them, so I feel kind of lucky that we have a good dealer.",0,1759366197.0,VWatlas,0,0.5,False

1nvpsfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1nvpsfk/gemini_woman_whiplash/,Gemini woman whiplash,"So we’ve been friends for the better part of a year, and about 3 months ago, she got tipsy, she said she was starting to like me as more than a friend. So we kissed, i know she was tipsy, so I didn’t read a lot into it. She just got out of her crappy marriage, so I know that is a factor also. So I understand she needs time, and this isn’t the time for a full blown relationship.

We kissed again when she wasn’t tipsy, so know there is something. We talk every day.  She says that she tells me her deepest secrets, admits that she has plenty of male attention. But I’m the male friend she is closest to.

We hang out, 2-3 times a week also. It’s just odd because we have these intimate moments. Couple days ago, she’s told me she loves me, and that she misses me. But we both know we’re not exclusive.

A couple days ago we were hanging out, she was lying on the floor, and reached her hand out and I grabbed it and asked “you need help getting up?” And she was like “no, I just wanted to hold your hand for a minute” Which ended the night with this 15min long intimate hug where we held one another. She will go from that to like it never happened.

She will go from talking sexually with me to flipping a switch and being like “hi friend” sometimes she calls me “boo” etc. she will tell me she tells all her acquaintances about me and everyone knows about me. But we’ve also said “anything good takes time” etc, it’s very back and forth.

We went from spending weekends together, to know she spends time with me during the week a lot, but not so much on weekends.

I’m not tripping out about any of it, we aren’t exclusive, I understand the “back and forth” is part of her personality. And she’s told me she backs off because she doesn’t want to rush in get overwhelmed and ghost me. Which is also fair.

She has gone out of her way before work to meet me at the gym and bring me coffee before work and tell me “I don’t bring coffee to anyone, especially guys” she’s gotten me pants and a pair of shoes when we were running late for a concert.

So we spent all day Sunday together. And had a great time. Face timed Monday night also. Then she got in her head about personal stuff. And said she felt the other twin coming out and she’d tried not to show me that side of her….

I was thinking we were on the same wave length  and getting to know one another.

She spent 2 hours yesterday eviscerating me. She told me that “when I ask questions when she’s talking” that I’m telling her what she’s thinking or feeling. I was genuinely asking questions and analyze to understand her better as a person I thought.

Then she told me that I don’t respect her physically. (We’ve only kissed twice, and held each other a hand full of times) she did have some trauma she shared with me. So the brushing the small of her back or patting her leg freaked her out. And I can admit I did that stuff a few times, but not on purpose. It’s just an unconscious thing. And I apologized, because I’ve always been very cognizant of how I interact with her physically. Then basically told me that I have been pushing her for a relationship and not listening to her. We literally had a talk the other day about how we just enjoyed, enjoying one another. That there was no pressure. Now she is saying there is all this pressure and resentment towards me. But all I’ve ever done is show up. Hang out, and try to be there for her. I genuinely thought we were just friends who liked each other.

We were both around 20 at the time. We had matched on Hinge, and when we started chatting, we both had undeniable sexual chemistry. Like off the charts. We both weren’t looking for something serious it seemed, so we made plans to meet up at my apt for wine which led to sleeping together at my place. I hadn’t been with anyone in a year and on the heels of a bad breakup, I was looking for something to get me back into the game. I hadn’t never ever had casual sex so I just thought I’d see. It was basically the best sex I’ve ever had. He slept over and left in the morning after asking to get coffee. I declined. We spent that one time together, and we went our separate ways as we both went to school in different states.

That following winter break, I reached out to him after he liked my insta story (a selfie of me) and asked if he was in town again. He was. He asked if I would go to his place, and he would make me dinner and we would play games (and then sleep together lol). I declined at the time, knowing that if we did more than sleep together I would get attached. I could tell me declining kind of off put him, but he agreed to coming over to my place since my roommates would be gone. We had sex, and then immediately after, he jumped up and said he had to leave to take care of something. Like super uncomfortable. I asked him if he’d like to stay and he declined. We both hadn’t said anything to each other for a month, and then one week after my birthday he texted saying we should just be friends. Which I was confused by since I thought that was what was going on? In hindsight, he may have wanted to date me but didn’t communicate that and I legit didn’t know.

We both got into relationships for a year, and then both ended those relationships around the same time recently. Now that im in a stable part of life and I know that I am a relationship person and not a casual one (thanks to him) I’m thinking of reaching out and seeing the vibe? I genuinely don’t want to just hook up and just want to see if any interest is still there since I’m the one that kinda messed up. I’ve been thinking about him a lot lately because he was such a sweet and smart guy, I just never entertained it before because I was under the assumption we both wanted something casual. And now we only live 30 minutes away so it seems more viable. And if we’re friends then what’s the harm.

Someone tell me if this is a god awful idea or if I should just go for it or if he was icked out by me and made it very clear. And if I do reach out how do I approach it? Please be gentle with a curious girl.",1,1759366003.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

A cross when the striker is offside before the ball comes to him. It's typical and always comes at the worst time of all. It's really annoying and i can't understand why this shit isn't fixed?

I specifically looked at psg tonight how they defended when Barca had some control. They went a bit back around like 30/25m from their goal and kept it tight, why did they do this? They did this so they could absorb the attacks of Barça better. While Barça takes the risk to prevent attacks, PSG tries to absorb most of it and keep lines tight and press hard. Because they know Barça is foolhardy and never concedes. 

Even then, PSG also used a high line, but when?
They did this when Barca was building up. When Barca was close to the midfieldline, they went a bit back to absorb, but kept it on manmarking the wings. They left Ferran free a lot of times, but Ferran has shit ball control and Olmo next to him looked like had had bricks in his shoes. So Barça kept losing the ball a lot of times in the build up. 

This game was all about tactics, because we could have won and we could have had more control. It all depends on details. Psg has become a master of knowing when to press, while Barça just uses 100% and when it fails, it becomes dangerous.

Btw, why the fuck was there a high line in the 90th minute? Because Barça is foolhardy. It was a useless high line, absolutely useless and careless. Balde was 50m from Hakimi. Hakimi had so much space and time, he could have chilled and have a coffee with his cross to Ramos.

Also; I'm really concerned with Olmo, he looks like a player who is 35 and has no legs. He is slow, has no dribble and makes terrible decisions. Fermin looks 50x the player when he has the ball. Olmo destroyed our ballcontrol and missed a open goal chance ffs.",1,1759365867.0,Barca,0,0.67,False

On a brisk morning in South Dakota, Gavin Jensen scrolls through campaign analytics while sipping his first coffee of the day. Numbers flash across the screen, but for him, they’re not the whole story. “Data can tell us what customers are doing, but it doesn’t always explain why,” he often says. That simple truth has guided his career: marketing must remain human at its core.

Rooted in Two Worlds

Jensen’s story stretches between South Dakota and Bennington, Nebraska. The dual presence reflects his balance of tradition and innovation. In South Dakota, he learned the value of trust and hard work. In Bennington, he immersed himself in thriving business communities eager to embrace change. Together, these places shaped his belief that effective marketing blends authenticity with forward-looking strategy.

Clients describe him as both approachable and relentless. He listens closely, then challenges assumptions. “Too often, businesses chase trends without a clear understanding of what resonates with their customers,” Jensen explains. His consultancy, Gavin Jensen Marketing, was built to change that pattern, turning noise into strategy, and uncertainty into growth.

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

Everyone else is free to explore and communicate with me with little to no monitorization and communication with my husband.""


"" Friendship. It’s a complex social phenomenon rooted in reciprocal altruism and the desire for connection. I am looking for a in person & in real life friendship but willing to be open to a online friendship. I want to be friends with someone who like the same topics I like. But willing to be friends with people who has different favorite topics then mine. I expected my new friend to communicate with me at least once a week for at least an hour a week. I want a low maintenance friend. We can read a book together and talk about it. We can FaceTime and watch a movie together. We can talk about life together. I want to from a deep and passionate bond with someone other then my husband.""

Also I use AI to learn deeper and better. To fill in the gaps on my knowledge. Not a clutch but an helpful assistant. My actual human intelligence and artificial intelligence make a great team. Also I do use it all the time or everyday. Just when I feel like a need a boost in knowledge because I love learning, I am addicted to learning.

Hello! I'm someone who thrives on creativity, curiosity, and connection. My heart truly belongs to the arts—whether I'm singing along to a musical, learning a new dance routine, or getting lost in a character while acting. I love the process of creating anything from scratch, be it a crochet project, a piece of art, or a story.

My mind is just as active as my hands! I'm a bit of an epistemophile and philomath (a lover of knowledge and learning), which means I'm constantly down a research rabbit hole or buried in a book. While I have a soft spot for self-help and a good romance novel, I'm always open to new literary adventures. This love for learning extends to Asian culture, and I'm currently on the rewarding journey of learning the Japanese language.

When I'm not creating or studying, you can find me enjoying all kinds of games. From the strategic depths of Dungeons & Dragons and board games to the immersive worlds of video and VR games, I believe games are a fantastic way to bond and have fun.

Above all, I value genuine, kind-hearted people. I am pansexual. I have a deep love and unwavering support for the LGBTQ+ community and believe everyone deserves to be their authentic self. I’m looking to build real, supportive friendships here in Huntsville Alabama, and I’d be thrilled to connect with fellow curious and creative souls.



I am willing to do any of these.
· Be Bold: ""I really enjoyed talking with you about [D&D/that book/musicals]. Would you be interested in grabbing coffee sometime?""
· Suggest a Specific, Low-Pressure Activity: ""A few of us are going to try the new ramen place next week, would you like to join?""
· Use Your Shared Interest: ""I'm trying to start a new crochet project, would you want to work on our projects together at the library sometime?""

Hello there! I'm a person who feels music deeply—it's the soundtrack to my life. My playlist is a vibrant mix of everything from the storytelling of country and the energy of rap to the catchy hooks of pop, the soul of R&B, and the powerful emotions of Broadway musicals. If a song has a great beat and a meaningful message, it has my heart. This love often turns into movement; I adore dancing, especially hip-hop, and I love the creative challenge of choreographing my own routines.

When I'm not lost in music, you'll often find me happily falling down a research rabbit hole. I'm a naturally curious person, and learning about my favorite topics is a joyful hyperfixation of mine. One of my favorite ways to relax is to combine this with my love for creating; you'll frequently find me crocheting something new while listening to an audiobook or a long, informative YouTube video.

I'm neurodivergent and still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain. I experience traits associated with autism, anxiety, depression, and BPD, which means I experience the world with a lot of intensity, passion, and deep empathy. While my conversations often light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects, I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love. Nothing makes me happier than hearing someone talk passionately about their own interests.

I'm looking for friends who appreciate authenticity, can share in deep dives on random topics, and maybe even have a spontaneous dance break with me.
""I really want someone to dance and hang out& parallel play with"" 

1. Leading with Passion, Not Labels:

· Original: ""I like all alternative music...""
· Reframed: Starting with ""I feel music deeply"" is an emotional invitation. It explains the why behind your interest, which is more relatable than a list. People connect with feelings first and details second.

2. Turning ""Hyperfixation"" into a Shared Activity:

· Original: ""going down rabbit holes it is a hyper fixation of mine.""
· Reframed: Phrases like ""I'm a naturally curious person"" and ""joyful hyperfixation"" frame this trait positively. It transforms it from an internal experience into a potential shared joy: ""Want to fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole with me about the history of crochet?"" or ""Do you have any podcast recommendations for while I work on my next project?""

3. Disclosing Neurodivergence with Strength and Clarity:

· Original: The list of conditions can feel overwhelming to someone who doesn't understand them.
· Reframed: Stating you are ""still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain"" is disarming and honest. It focuses on the outcomes—""intensity, passion, and deep empathy""—which are wonderful qualities in a friend. This explains your communication style (""I light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects"") while simultaneously showing you're a great listener (""I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love""). This is a very inviting balance.


"" I would love to hang out together doing an activity based thing or topic. Or just show up for each other and parallel play in person or on the phone. We can even body double on a task for each other.""

· Use Your ""Deep Dive"" Superpower: When you meet someone, ask them, ""What could you talk about for hours?"" This question invites them to share their passion and signals that you are a safe person for deep, enthusiastic conversations.
· Script an Opening Line: Having a friendly, prepared line can ease social anxiety. It could be as simple as:
  · ""I'm really passionate about [music/choreography/crochet]. What's something you're really into right now?""
  · ""I love learning about new things. Tell me something interesting you've learned lately!""

Your willingness to be open and your capacity for passionate interest are beautiful qualities that will attract the right kind of friends. The key is to present these traits as the strengths they are. You are not just looking for a friend; you are looking for a friend to share deep dives, creative projects, and honest conversations with—and that is a wonderful offer.

A More Heartfelt and Friendly Revision

To my future friends in North Alabama,

If you're reading this and feel a connection, I'd love to hear from you! Building genuine, trusting friendships is my goal.

To create a comfortable and secure environment for everyone, including myself, I want to be upfront about my boundaries. For personal reasons rooted in past experiences, I am not seeking one-on-one friendships with straight men. My deepest and most important friendship is with my husband, and our relationship is built on a foundation of mutual trust and transparency.

The one exception to this is if a straight man is interested in becoming a friend to both of us as a couple. In that case, any friendship would naturally include my husband, and our interactions would be as a group. This isn't about monitoring, but about building a connection that respects the primary partnership in my life.

For everyone else—women and LGBTQ+ folks—I am thrilled and open to building a direct, one-on-one friendship with you. My husband is a wonderful part of my life, but he doesn't need to be a central part of our friendship.

On a related but separate note, while my primary goal is finding deep friendships, my husband and I are ethically non-monogamous. We are open to the possibility of a polyamorous relationship, but only with the right, rare connection that develops very naturally over time. (Female only) This is not an invitation, but a piece of information for full transparency.

My hope is to find kind, understanding people who value honesty as much as I do. If this sounds like a friendship you'd be comfortable with, please don't hesitate to reach out.

A More Heartfelt and Friendly Revision

I believe friendship is one of life's greatest adventures—a shared journey of discovery, support, and joy. While I have a wonderful and secure marriage, I am yearning to build a deep, passionate platonic bond with someone else; a unique connection that stands on its own.

My ideal is to find a local friend for in-person connection here in North Alabama, but I'm absolutely open to the magic of a strong online friendship as well.

What would our friendship look like? I dream of the simple, meaningful things: reading the same book and getting lost in conversation about it, having a weekly FaceTime call to watch a movie together, or just talking for an hour about life, our dreams, and whatever we're currently obsessed with. I thrive on that kind of consistent, low-pressure connection. A quick check-in once a week would mean the world to me and help a bond grow strong.

While I have my own favorite topics I could talk about for hours, I am genuinely excited to learn about what lights you up. A true friend celebrates both shared passions and new perspectives.

If you're looking for a loyal, curious, and dedicated friend to build a genuine, consistent connection with, I would be so happy to hear from you.

1nvpfrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nvpfrb/birthday_money_guilt/,birthday money guilt,"I've never posted to reddit before but i figured i should give this a shot? Throwaway because my mom likes this subreddit and i dont want her to recognize me obviously. For the record, i am transmasc. I am not out to my mom, which is kind of important for context on our relationship as mom/daughter. But i say this so you guys dont misgender me please. Pronouns are he/him.

TLDR at the end.

So. My(20) birthday just passed last week. My mom(43) doesn't really do gifts or parties for me anymore. My dad gave me a few bucks and desserts, of my choice, which i appreciated greatly. But my mom kind of does the ""yes we'll get you a \_\_\_ in a few days"" and never does thing, so i didn't have a cake this year. Anyway, that's not what i'm upset about. I get a lot of family calls on my birthday, and my grandparents like to do little gifts like shoes and makeup and whatnot. Recently i just get money and that's all though, likely to avoid getting me something i dont want/wont use. Yknow? How grandparents buy their alternative grandkid a pair of hollister jeans one too many times and eventually give up and just give 'em 40 bucks.

Usually when i get any sort of money, my mom will find a way to take it from me.  It's not always direct, but i pretty much dont get to spend the money on things i want. My parents dont really keep up with household items like making sure we have detergent to wash clothes with, or keeping toilet paper in the bathroom. Sometimes we go days without like dish soap. And because im currently between jobs, my mom kind of expects me to housekeep 24/7. Which i dont take that much issue with. I clean and cook and everything, but with no job how is it my fault we dont have hair conditioner yknow? Whenever i have money, i spend it on household items. Even when i did have a job, i was the one restocking the cleaning supplies and mopping in my free time.

So last week was my birthday and my grandparents wanted to send me money virtually for the first time. It didn't work for some reason so they sent it to my mom so she could send it to me... Which is fine. But they sent it on Thursday evening. I had to remind her (gently) to send me the money before she forgot. She doesn't really take advice or questions or requests very well, so i always have to make sure to ""suggest"" or ""remind"" her of stuff very delicately. So it took a while but she finally sent me the money on Monday afternoon, after i texted her in the morning. My grandparents sent me $100 for shoes and my aunt sent me $40 for cake and snacks (my mom doesnt accept grocery requests from me so i buy my snacks separately). I intended to buy some new sneakers because my favorite ones are worn with holes in them. But my mom only sent me $80 on Monday. When she got home from work i made a vague comment about it like ""oh these shoes i want are $100 but i only have 80, oops!"" and she just gave me an ""aw thats too bad.""

So i had to subtly hint again later until she sent me the other $60. On Tuesday, my mom reminded me she needed some stuff from the store so she told me i should go ""when i got the chance"" which means ""get that shit done."" So today, Wednesday, she woke me up at 7am and i went to go run my errands. I did my house chores, washed my laundry (i dont send it with my family's laundry bc they let it sit for too long and i do mine every two weeks), and bought all the stuff my mom wanted. I got an ice pop and a new coffee mug for myself but not much else. Everything else i got was communal items or medical things i need that my mom refuses to buy. I only have like $30 left over and i'm kind of disappointed that i wont be getting new shoes. I can still buy some snacks and craft supplies, sure. But still...

Am i the asshole for being upset about this? I feel kind of robbed, but also... she's my mom. I kind of owe her for still living at home at my age, being jobless, etc. But also damn, it was my 20th birthday and i'm broke again. I was excited to spend that birthday money, yknow? Idk, i wont complain to her about it but i wanted to know if i really am being ungrateful or something.

TLDR: Grandparents sent me $140 for my birthday and bc of a technical mishap they had to send it to me through my Mom but she withheld it for a few days and then only gave me like half, and then gave me all of it. But then i had to spend most of it on household items she refuses to buy and i couldn't buy myself birthday gifts besides some snacks

I hope this was coherent? I know i went on some tangents but i feel like this is the bare minimum of context needed for this... Please let me know what you think

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

My phone's battery used to give me so much anxiety. I'd be out running errands, and by 3 PM, I'd be mentally mapping every coffee shop with an outlet between me and home. It felt like I was caring for a high-maintenance pet that needed constant feeding.



That whole ordeal is actually what got me paying closer attention to battery health. I learned most modern phone batteries, like the one in my new iPhone 17, are designed to last. The real trick isn't just the hardware; it's the software that manages it. The phone learns your routine and actually optimizes charging to slow down battery aging. It’s pretty clever—it will pause charging at 80% if it knows you won't unplug it for a few more hours.



It’s a small thing, but not having that low-battery panic has been quietly life-changing. I can finally leave the house without doing the mental calculation of ""battery percentage versus potential emergencies."" The best part is a little detail I read: these batteries are rated to retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 1,000 full charge cycles. That means you could theoretically charge it every single day for nearly three years before you'd even notice a significant drop. It’s built for the long haul, which is a relief for someone like me who likes to hold onto things.

Hope everyone is well. Trying this again :)

I’m looking for someone that I can chat with but open to something more - hoping for something more tbh but keeping in mind the reality of how online interactions go. 

A bit about me: Friendly, ambivert, good conversationalist, can get lost in a good book or good Netflix series. Like travelling, walking  around the city and curling up on the couch with a cup of hot coffee or tea when it gets a bit colder. Currently learning more about investing (brownie points if you are good and can share a few pointers!) No kids and no pets. 

I’m looking for a good connection but I can also tell you who I would tend to get along well with and what kind of men I prefer (simply a preference, no judgement). I get along with people that are also ambiverts, ambitious, white collar professionals who have integrity, are honest and respectful, have a good sense of humour and can carry a conversation. 

Prefer men 37+ and in North America, EST /CST time zone - it just makes conversations easier. I’d hate to have a choppy/ very spaced out interaction. 

Kindly swipe left if you’re married, partnered or if you are looking for a one-day/ one-night conversation only lol, sorry but it won’t work :) Consistency and respect in conversations is important to me. 

Anyways if this interests you, holler 💕

**\*- Kensington, 10ml EDP spray with 8ml left, $35: Earl Grey tea, cashmere, dark vanilla bean, smooth cedar, dried rose petals, mandarin zest, pink peppercorn, and a burst of fresh bergamot.  Where ancient, dusty tomes meet natural sunlight. Where magic, archaic lore, witchcraft, and ancient feminist writings come alive once again.

**\*- During the Rain, brand new 5ml roller, $20:  During the Rain will take you on a journey starting with a barometric pressure drop and darkened sky upon initial application. The insects sound their symphonic alarm as the rumble of thunder grows louder and closer. A flash of lightning strikes ahead of an explosion of cold raindrops.

**\*\*\*DSH (Dawn Spencer Hurwitz):**

**\*- Beach Blanket, 1ml vial, $4: In the middle of winter I always go to my beach things and open the box to breathe in the scent.  It’s the beach blanket that holds all of my memories of days spent at the shore hearing the waves crash, feeling the sun on my shoulders, and smelling the mix of salt, sand, the sea, and invariable the suntan oil I love.  (In fact I love two: the creamy coconut scented ones and classic bain de soleil that I’ve used since childhood).**

**\*- Maui, full 1ml vial, $4: Glorious Hawaiian sandalwood and an utterly exotic natural coconut pulp co2 makes Maui stupendously creamy while giving it a sheer, breezy, tropical feel that is like lying in a hammock listening to the ocean waves.  A soft, blond wood accord in the base keeps Maui from going “pina colada” sweet, making it the perfect summer scent for both men and women alike.**

**\*- Orion, 2.5 ml decant from my bottle, $11: A soft, warm and cozy ‘kitten’ fur skin scent fragrance; an entrance animalic perfume for those who are curious but not ready to dive into the ‘deep end’ of the funk.  (It’s very wearable and totally unisex).**

**\*- Romance, 1.2ml spray sample, $2: Top notes are Rose, Chamomile, Ginger, Lemon and Yellow Freesia; middle notes are Lily, Lotus, White Violet and Carnation; base notes are White Musk, Oakmoss, Exotic Woods and Patchouli.** 



**\*\*\*REPLICA/ Maison Margiela:**

**\*- From the Garden, 1.2ml spray, $2: The grounding sensation of placing one’s hands in the earth; the pleasure of picking ripe, juicy tomatoes; the buzz of bees in the air.  The fragrance’s Tomato Leaf accord combines with Green Mandarin notes to create a crisp, juicy effect. While green and uplifting, From the Garden’s notes of Patchouli and Geranium bring a humid, earthy quality. Contrasted with the fragrance's freshness, the result is an elegant, crisp scent, conjuring the memory of a sunny afternoon spent in a garden.**",1,1759364615.0,IndieExchange,1,1.0,False

I’m a digital artist, educator, and entrepreneur based in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela. I care for 16 rescued cats 🐾 and I’m building a project that blends emotional art, practical spirituality, and functional design.

I’m currently developing a coffee recipe book infused with emotional and spiritual rituals, designed for Amazon KDP and Gumroad. It includes illustrations, angelic messages, journaling spaces, and interactive elements. I’m also exploring how to sell planners and printables that help people heal, organize, and reconnect.

Here are my current challenges:  
- Monetizing this kind of emotional art without falling into generic formats.  
- Publishing interactive books on Gumroad (how do others do it?).  
- Building community and generating sustainable income for myself and my cats.

I’m using Ecency to share spiritual content and earn Hive rewards, and setting up Wise to receive international payments. Has anyone else gone through this? What strategies worked for you?

I’d deeply appreciate any advice, experiences, or resources. I’m also open to collaborations ✨

I’ve come across one of these bugs in my living room in the past and most recently my cat has tracked down another one in a similar location. Both times they have been near or on top of my wooden coffee table in our living room. 

I haven’t seen any of them in either the kitchen or bathroom, and I’d like to believe I keep a pretty clean apartment (vacuuming the carpet a few times a week, swiffer the floor, etc.) and we don’t leave food out. 

The building itself is older, pre-war, wooden floors.

1nvp4ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTQMentalHealth/comments/1nvp4ie/just_need_to_get_this_out_because_i_feel_like_im/,Just need to get this out because I feel like Im on the verge of psychosis,"It’s been rough time for past month. Back story, I already have been struggling with anxiety and depression for years, with social anxiety being a big part of it. Also, I moved from my home country to the UK more than 5 years ago now and it’s just been hard. I moved out because of my narcissistic parents, and I went no contact 2 years ago now (which doesn’t help with the time everything is going on)! it was a right decision and I do not regret it! They were very abusive but unfortunately to make that move I cut all the ties I had with country I am from. My all family, friends except for my 2 siblings that I still talk. Also, I always knew I’m gay but waited until I move out to be sure I’m safe enough to do it. 
Moving to the UK in the middle of pandemic didn’t help to make any type of friends. I stared university twice but needed to drop out because I had no financial support and I need to have a full time job and my English at the time wasn’t the best. I have my boyfriend that I love so much and he is the best thing I’ve ever met.
So I got fired at the beginning of September from job I started 2 months prior. Expectations and reasoning to terminate weren’t the clearest and kind of shitty. Felt very unfair and it just kind of broke me. For my whole life I’ve heard my “father” tell me I won’t success in anything. Coming to that job from horrible position in retail I was so happy I finally change environment as I hated working face to face in clothing shop I always thought I’ll be hate crimed or attacked, dealing with rude people but also having horrible management. Since then I don’t see any point in living. I’m trying for my boyfriend and my cat but if there was an option where I can just disappear and memory of me would be removed from everyone’s mids I’d do it in a heartbeat. I always suspected I had other mental issues,my partner has psychology degree and he suspect Bipolar disorder, I also have undiagnosed ADHD, my therapists suggested to get check but NHS is a joke and I just simply don’t have money to go private. But even that I feel like I don’t have anything and I’m just imagining all the struggles I have, I feel like I’ll waste these specialists times with my “faked” symptoms. 
But coming back to the point, I just feel like a failure. I don’t have friends, I just lost a job and I feel lost, I don’t have any hobbies, but I’m too scared or stressed to even thinking of going out or do something. Every task feeling like the hardest chore and at the same time I feel this invisible film on my body that doesn’t let me get out from my bed. So I’m staying to watch TikTok, other social media and that makes it worse. Seeing people with friend groups, passions, doing all those amazing thing and not being afraid of what people say. I cannot go out for a cigarette in a car that is locked, I’m with my boyfriend and  literally outside my flat without being in constant fight or fly mode. I cannot relax, I feel like I’m a constant target, I feel like I have this huge sign above my head that say “gay” that invites homophobes to do their thing. When I’m going to the city centre to have a coffee, I cannot relax as I constantly look if I’m safe or I’m not triggering anyone to confront me. My boyfriend has friends and I met most of them and I am close with some of them but it’s like we are friends because I’m his boyfriend. We like each other and we meet up regularly but I don’t chat outside our group chat. He is supportive and very inclusive but I feel bad with just trying to fit in. 
Also I started being even more depressed.
Before I was functioning but now the only reason I eat or even take showers is I know it would affect my partner too and I cont not do that to him. 
It just feels like I’m on the verge of psychosis or some kind of life blur. Days are the same, I don’t have any sex drive which affects our relationship and that stresses me to because I don’t want him to feel like I’m not attracted to him anymore as that’s not the truth. I cannot even explain everything as once I start a thought it’s just going and going. 
I’m stressed about our money situation at the same time as I got fired and he is self employed and starting his business, and I feel like I failed to help him as much as I could. And the same time my self esteem is even lover than it was, I cut my hair in one moment and now I hate it even more, I cannot look into the mirror without judging myself. I feel fat, I feel ugly, talentless and again social media and gay “standards” don’t help at all. And it’s not like I don’t want to talk about it with my partner but I feel like I’m just dropping this all burden onto him and he doesn’t deserve it. It’s a lot and I don’t want him to stress and treat me differently that I had suicidal thoughts or how I just want to lay in bed, dissociate and cry. I wish i could speak to him about it without affecting him at all. I love him v much and he is the most supportive and loving boyfriend. I’m just tired and I don’t know what is happening with me.

We’ve talked on that platform for few weeks. He was gentle and genuine. We have the same interests in golf, so our topics were always evolving in golf! After few weeks, we exchanged our numbers, so started messaging each other daily! We shared about our daily lives and golfing experiences. One day I asked him out. And he was shocked to say “I’m asked out by a woman.’ So we had our first date on April 19th. He came over to me, we had dinner at a Japanese restaurant, had really nice conversation, and yes, we went to a hotel! After that we kept messaging each other daily, but he never asked me out for a date. The seconds date was on April 27th. I finished my 10k marathon, and we supposed to have a celebration night together! I was waiting for him to message me after his work. He didn’t message me until I insisted to go to his place. So that’s our second date. The next morning, we went out for coffee and he drove me around to show me his community. It was a nice night, he talked about his childhood and his family. I thought there was a connection between us. After the date, everything went back to normal, still messaging daily, but didn’t initiate any dates! Two weeks later, my son had his school camp, so I asked him if he wanted to see me. I was planning to have a trip with him, but his words seemed like he was not really interested. We had our third date when I backed from Vancouver island. Yes, I asked him for this date, and he said he wanted to see me! So we had a night in Georgia hotel downtown. And yes, I booked it for us! So he just showed up! The next morning, we went back to our own homes. He texted me every day, but I felt bad, because I was doing one-sided work. He didn’t put any efforts to maintain our relationship. So I ghosted him, he asked me Angie, is this real? I told him I don’t want to paddle alone, it made me tired! He said thanks for the clarity! Few days later, we met up on the golf course where he worked! I didn’t know he works in the Proshop. It was a coincidence. He said if I’d like a talk. I said sure! So we met another day, he took me to Fort Langley, we had two hours there, and started our relationship again. He asked me be his caddie on his big tournament. I showed up and he introduced me to everyone on the course. It was weird, because he was the butterfly chatted to everyone, ignoring me there alone. He might thought I should talking to those people he introduced to me! I was not shy, not introverted, but just wanted he to care about me when he putting in front 100 people whom I didn’t know! I was so mad, left his wallet, keys on his car, and left by sending a photo which showed him his stuff on his car! I know I was wrong! I should express my feelings to him instead of being childish! He was so mad, and luckily found everything back. He called me back, and we went back his house! It was a bad night, we both didn’t have our good mood at that night! The second day I was there supporting him, but the feeling was gone. I told him I had to go to my friend‘a party after his tourney. He said yes, safe drive! Then we had two dates after, still felt unseen and insecure. Asked him how to define our relationship, he said he didn’t know, but he’s not seeing anyone else, he’s not going to see someone else, he got hooked on me. So we continued doing this for over 5 months! This Sunday, I asked him I want to see him, so we set up a time for Monday. At the last minute, he sent me a message asked me ; How opposed would you be to rain check tonight for tomorrow!? A. I’m not feeling the hottest! B. Early am. C. We get waaaaay more time to do something tomorrow and don’t have to rush out the next am! D. Up to you !? 😊  At that moment, I told myself, this person is not the right person for you, you have to move on. So I sent back; just cancel it! Thanks for your kindness! I’ll move on! Take care! Then silence! He didn’t even respond back! So things went over! I felt hurt, painful, inconsiderate, not his priority. I am the one who always carries the weight! It’s an unbalanced relationship, even at the end, I still didn’t know where I stand! Ridiculous!!!!!",1,1759364152.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

A cold brew method using a fining agent for clearer, less wasteful, and flavorful coffee, ready in 12 hours.

**Tips & Preparation**

Recipe Background:

* Traditional cold brew is wasteful due to high coffee-to-water ratios and incomplete extraction.
* Aim is to achieve better value for money from the coffee.
* Address the oxidized taste that develops in older cold brews.
* Maximize flavor extraction even with cold water.

Preparations:

* Grind: close to Moka pot or fine side of AeroPress
* Use relatively soft water, low in buffer, room temperature
* Carbon filter the water if necessary.
* Fining agent (vegan preferred) is used to clarify the cold brew. Use 1 drops per 100ml.

Variations/Adjustments:

* Experiment with different roast levels and coffee types to find preferred cold brew profiles.
* Light roasts may not be ideal for cold brew; darker roasts and natural processed coffees can yield surprisingly good results.
* Adjust fining agent quantity based on batch size (10 drops per liter).
* Consider water chemistry, though it has less impact than with hot brewing methods.

  
Recipe Steps

* Add 75g of finely ground coffee to a vessel.
* Add 1 liter of room temperature water.
* Stir the mixture use a spoon.Add 10 drops of fining agent, Mix in the fining agent.
* Leave it for 12 hours with a lid on in the refrigerator.
* Gently pour off the clear coffee into a carafe, leaving the sediment at the bottom.
* Enjoy your brew with in a day to avoid the aging taste.",1,1759363493.0,BeanBook,0,1.0,False
1nvotpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nvotpv/i_finally_got_asked_to_our_towns_halloween_fair_i/,I Finally Got Asked to Our Town’s Halloween Fair. I Didn’t Know What the Girls Do in the Basement.,"Alright, so, this is gonna sound like small-town nonsense, but stick with me. 

My town’s got this weird tradition every October. We don’t have Sadie Hawkins. We don’t even get a prom. We get *The Fair*. 

That’s the name everyone uses. Capital F, like it’s a holiday.

Every Halloween the high school girls ask the high school guys out to a festival, and if you don’t get asked, you don’t go. 

No singles allowed. Couples only. 

Sounds lame? It is when you’re the kid who never gets picked. That was me for three years straight. Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior years. 

Dad tried to cheer me up with takeout and jokes. Mom pretended not to notice me parked on Instagram like a sad dog when couple pics paraded by. 

For weeks the town wouldn’t shut up about who wore what and who kissed where. And all I’ve ever had for fall memories involved leftover cheese bread and Netflix specials.

Last fall though, the script finally flipped.

It was a Tuesday in the chem lab. The room smelled like melted plastic because old Mr. Winchell had us cooking who-knows-what in the Bunsens. I was tracing boxes in my notebook when Jess slid onto the stool across from me. Goggles on. Hair tied back. 

She told me, “You’re free on Halloween, right?”

I laughed. What else do you do when the girl you liked since middle school hits you with that?

“Yeah,” I said. “Why?”

She leaned across the counter like she was plotting something. “I’m asking you to come with me to the Fair. Officially. Don’t make it weird.”

My brain shorted out. “You serious?”

She gave me a crooked half smirk. “Do I look like I’m kidding? My mom is helping with my costume. Don’t bail on me.”

“Yeah, okay. I’m in. Definitely in.”

Winchell tapped a glass rod against the counter. “Voices down. Class isn’t over.”

Jess gave me a quick wink and returned to her notes like she hadn’t just lit a fire under my skull.

Later, in the locker room, the guys were trading the usual smack about dates. 

Sanders had been asked by the captain of the volleyball team. Clay claimed he got two invites and had to choose one and “break a heart.” Nobody bought it.

Sanders eventually turned my way. “What about you, man? Couch duty again?”

I yanked on my gym shirt and tried to play it cool. “Actually, Jess asked me.”

The room went silent for a second, then Sanders whistled. “Wow. About time. Thought you two would drag this out forever.”

Clay snapped a towel across my back. “Don’t mess it up. She’s out of your league.”

“Love the encouragement,” I said.

At dinner Dad nearly spilled his coffee when he heard. “Jess? As in Jess Miller? Your friend Jess Miller?”

“Yeah.”

Mom came in from the kitchen with flour on her palms. “Thank goodness. I was wondering when you were going to do something with that girl. She’s pretty.”

“Guess you weren’t the only one thinking that,” I said.

Dad elbowed me. “You gonna take the Chevy? The first date deserves something better than that rust bucket I make you drive to school.”

Mom nodded. “We still have that old pickup. Same one your father drove me to the Fair in.”

Dad beamed. “Best night of my life.”

“Don’t exaggerate,” Mom said, though her mouth curled at the edge.

Later I texted Jess, asking what she was going as. 

She sent back: *Classic witch. Pointy hat, the whole deal. You’ll see it Friday night.*

I told her I was thinking about being a vampire. She replied: *Just don’t make it lame. Full cape or nothing.*

So I started hunting for costumes online, scrolling through eBay and Spirit Halloween listings, checking what I could afford with the forty bucks in my wallet. Every night since, I’ve been pacing it out in my head: what to wear, what to say, how not to come off like an idiot.

In a surprise twist of events, my parents were more amped than I was about it.

Dad kept telling stories about the rides, how the lights looked, the magic of it all. He showed a faded ribbon on his wrist and said when Mom tied it there, he knew he’d marry her.

Mom swore everyone in town remembers their first Fair. She said hers was like a wedding, all dressed up and perfect. 

I just groaned and kept myself focused on the weekend.

Alright, so here’s the part everybody wants to hear. 

The pick up. The Fair. The thing.

Dad lobbed the keys at me in the driveway. They smacked my palm and I fumbled, then caught them against my chest. “Don’t grind the clutch. She bites if you baby her.”

Mom tugged at my cape collar like I was six. “Give me one photo with teeth. You always do that little smirk thing. It looks awful.”

“That’s just how my face works, Mom,” I said, swatting her hand away with a laugh I couldn’t help.

Dad stepped back and took in the truck from grille to tailgate. “She’s a classic, Robbie. Treat her firm like a lady and she won’t quit on you.”

“Got it,” I said. My palms were slick and I hadn’t even left the driveway.

Jess lives on the far side of town, past the feed store and the big oak with the rope swing that never comes down. Her street plays like a movie set in October. Her house fits the scene.

Pumpkins lined the steps. A paper skeleton swung off-kilter in the wind. Purple porch bulbs washed the railings.

I parked and checked my teeth in the rearview. Mom’s thumbprint still smudged the cape collar. I wiped it clean and headed up the walk.

Jess opened the door before I could knock. Witch hat. Black dress that looked expensive but probably came from her mom’s sewing room. Green bow at her throat. She gave me a quick, bright look.

“So you picked cute witch, not wart witch,” I said.

She tweaked the brim. “I was going to glue a big wart on my nose. My mom vetoed it. She said she didn’t want me to vandalize myself like that.”

A woman’s voice poured out from inside the house. “Wait right there so I can get a picture of you two. Just hang on, wait a second. I’m almost there.”

Jess’s mom stepped out with a camera on a seat-belt strap. She had the same eyes as her daughters and the same look behind them. Same green, same spark, same depth.

Her dad followed her out with a beer cozy that said Lake Life. “Bring her back by midnight or you’ll end up scaring crows in our backyard.”

“Yes sir,” I said. 

He laughed and took a sip.

Her mom posed us on the porch. We did the photo lineup. Me, Jess, a pumpkin, fake cobwebs and a spider stapled to the bannister. 

Her mom said, “Closer.” 

“Not too close,” her dad cut in.

Jess rolled her eyes so hard I could hear it. 

”Smile like you like him,” her mom said.

“I asked him out, didn’t I,” Jess said. She edged in until she bumped my arm. My brain stalled. The camera clicked and clicked.

A little kid stuck his face around the door. Her brother, Ben. “Win me something,” he said. “Not a goldfish this time. Those never survive the ride home.”

“You get what you get,” Jess said. “I don’t negotiate with gremlins. Back inside or I’ll curse you.”

Ben darted back inside.

As we turned for the steps, her mom tapped my elbow. “Drive careful.”

“Oh, and is your insurance paid up?” her father asked.

Jess groaned. “Dad.”

“Joking,” he said, not really joking. He gave the truck a once-over like a horse he might buy. “That the old Chevy your dad’s been working on?”

“Yeah,” I said. “He kept it running.”

“Good stuff,” he said.

We climbed in. She slid toward the door, taking in the bench and dash. “This smells like Ben’s old baseball glove.”

“Leather, old dust and sweat?” I asked. “We usually keep it in the garage. It's a bit musty.”

She snorted and parked her hat in her lap so it wouldn’t fly away. 

The sky was purple and orange with the last bit of daylight leaving the horizon. Houses flickered to life with fake candles and string lights. A couple walked down the sidewalk in matching brown sweaters pointing at corkboard headstones in a neighbors yard. 

I turned the key and the truck rumbled like a small boat.

“You nervous?” she asked.

“Little bit.”

She smiled at the window. “Don’t be. It’s just the Fair.”

Her phone buzzed. 

She checked and held it up for me. Group chat with half the senior girls. All-caps chaos and blurry mirror pics.

She fired off a selfie of us in the truck. Thank God for white paint; I could feel the heat under the makeup.

On Main, we hit the turn for the fairgrounds and a wall of brake lights. The line crawled. Red dots burned ahead like a string of coals toward the gravel lot.

Kids bailed from cars and drifted toward admissions, hats bobbing, masks pushed on top. People everywhere. Costumes from lazy cat ears to full on movie monsters.

“Park near the exit,” Jess said. “I’m fine with walking.”

I slid into a spot behind a minivan with a decal that read: ‘Proud Volleyball Mom’ in huge letters. 

We climbed out. The cold turned our words to fog. Someone set off a tester firework in the distance and it cracked open the sky with a short green and orange scream and fizzled into nothing.

We cut through the lot with everyone else, gravel popping under our sneakers. Jess jammed her hat on and linked my arm like she was steering me. Kettle corn and wet leaves ran through the air.

“Okay,” she said. “Game plan. Admission first. Then food. Then rides. Then games. Then more food. Then fireworks.”

I relented to her demands and matched her pace.

The line to get inside curled past the fence. You could see pretty much the whole school jammed in there. Freshmen in store-bought masks, sophomores pretending they weren’t freezing in try-hard costumes, juniors playing it cool, seniors acting like they owned the place. 

There was about three hundred of us. 

Beyond the fence, the Ferris wheel turned slow and hush over everything, a big white clock that didn’t care about anything.

At the gate there were two folding tables with orange tablecloths and a banner that just said **THE FAIR**. 

Town moms ran the entry. Scarves and parkas, those puffy vests from soccer sidelines. They waved couples closer to keep the line sliding.

Up front stood two women in their early twenties with little stampers. I recognized one from last year’s graduation. She was a former track captain. Her hair was shorter now. The other one had a tattoo of a vine around her wrist.

“Couples only,” the one with the tattoo called down the line. “If you don't have a partner, turn around and don't waste our time. Everyone else, keep your hands out, palms down.”

Jess gave my palm a squeeze and edged us through the crowd.

The track star gave us a once-over and smiled at Jess. “Senior?”

“Yup.” Jess replied.

“Very exciting. Names?” she asked.

“Jessica Miller,” she said. “This is my date.”

“Robert Daniels,” I added. 

The woman echoed it, and a girl on her left logged us in a binder.

“You know about the senior girls photo in the auditorium happening later?” the woman asked.

“Yeah,” Jess said.

“Good. Swing by before the fireworks.”

“I will,” Jess said.

The woman weighed her for a beat and winked, then angled us toward the stamper.

“Hands.”

We held them out. The stamper hit us with a grinning ghost and WELCOME under it. The ink was cold. Mine came out a hair light.

“Keep that visible,” the stamper said. “Rides are covered. Games are cash. Food is cash. There’s an ATM by the blue porta-johns. Don’t ask me why they put it there, it wasn't our choice.”

“Sweet,” Jess said.

“Security’s around if you need them,” the woman said, pointing to two tall girls in black jackets and boots. “Enjoy the fair.”

We drifted from the table and got swept into a current of costumes.

Freshmen zipped past in group packs. A goth cluster posed for an album cover by the fence. The volleyball team rocked glitter capes and Wonder Woman suits.

Jess hooked my arm again. “So. Food time?”

She drifted us toward the concessions. Fryers hissed. Grills popped. Sugar hung everywhere, sweet and thick, with damp crispness under it that said Halloween had arrived.

A woman with hay-colored hair called, “Two-for-one on fried dough and corn dogs.”

We slid into line.

“Two?” the worker asked.

“Two, please. Thank you.”

The fryer slid them down a paper tray. We grabbed the goods and stepped back.

Before I could bite, Jess pointed to the cider stand next door. “Let’s grab hot cider too.”

That line moved faster.

By the time we hit the front, I was halfway through the corn dog. I ordered a pair of drinks for us. A girl with an old varsity jacket, maybe a year out of school, ran the blender. 

“Want extra apple sugar in it?” she asked.

“I mean, we’re at a fair, so sure.” Jess shrugged.

The girl curled a lip and dumped in a wild scoop. A sleeve patch read CLASS OF ’22.

We walked off with the drinks and ducked under an overhang strung with plastic bats and lights. One of the girls Jess knew walked by as a scarecrow and gave Jess a thumbs up. Jess threw an apple slice at her and they laughed together.

After the food, after the hot cider and after Jess was done throwing apple slices, we wandered over to the rides.

Jess spotted the tilt-a-whirl and grabbed my hand. “That one. We’re doing that one.”

The cars twirled, each painted like a different monster. Spinning was not my strong suit. “You sure? I mean, we just ate.”

She flashed a grin that dared me to man up. “You scared?”

That's all I needed to hear. 

We joined the line.

Behind us, a freshman griped about his mask fogging his glasses. His buddy said if he kept whining, the mask was going over the fence. Typical freshman noise.

At last we hit the front and dropped into a seat. Our cart had the shape of a wolf head with yellowed fangs.

Jess dropped the lap bar with a snort. “Don’t puke on me.”

“Why do you assume I’m gonna puke?” I asked. “Totally uncalled for.”

“Because you seem like the type.”

“What type is that?”

“The type who says ‘I’m fine’ right before spraying corn dog chunks everywhere.”

“Harsh,” I said, clutching my chest and feigning a wound. “I’ve got iron guts.”

She smirked. “Guess we’ll see about that, tough guy.”

The ride snapped to life. A heartbeat later we were hauling in circles. Cars slammed side to side, whipping us around.

Jess screamed half for fun, half from the real worry she’d lose her hat to the wind. She pressed her hand to the brim and squealed while her hair flew in every direction.

“You’re terrible at this,” I yelled.

“Shut up!” she yelled back, squealing harder.

The music playing over the speakers was some remix of “Monster Mash.” The lights flickered orange and green across people’s faces. Every time our car spun we’d lock eyes with another couple whipping around in the opposite direction, all of them laughing or shrieking like lunatics.

Jess leaned into me on a hard turn. The car jolted and rattled my teeth. She clamped the bar and shot me a dare. “Still got iron guts?”

“Still got iron guts.”

“You’re pale.”

“I'm a vampire.”

At last the ride eased, and the wolf car coasted to a stop. My legs went rubber when I climbed out. Jess hopped down like none of it touched her.

She sized me up, half taunt. “Look at those legs. You got noodles.”

“I’m good,” I said, trying to stand straighter than I felt.

“You’re lying.”

“Nope.”

“Then how about we test that? Win me something.”

“No problem,” I said, though my legs still ran on spaghetti.

We cut through a knot of pirates and zombies to the game alley. Bells clanged. A buzzer rasped. Lights barked for our attention.

Jess pointed at a booth with milk bottles stacked in neat rows. Top-shelf prizes were hulking bears with stitched smiles and ribbon bows. They sat there smug as kings.

“Ring toss,” Jess said. “The classic. It can't be that bad, right?”

An older woman with silver hair in a bun ran the booth. Orange-and-black nails flashed as she lined up glass bottles. Her smile stayed closed.

“Three for five,” she said. “Six for eight. Lovers get a seventh for luck.”

Jess bumped my elbow. “Seven. Obviously.”

“Seven,” I said, digging bills out of my wallet with hands that still buzzed from the ride.

She counted rings into my palms. “Throw smooth, not hard. Hard won’t land you anything.”

“Any tips on cheating?” I said.

“Bring extra cash,” she said, then cackled.

A couple beside us missed every toss, fake-fought over who was to blame, then settled on the game being rigged.

Jess went up on her toes to study the bottles. “Aim low. Let it kiss the neck.”

“Let it kiss the neck,” I repeated. “That your secret witch spell?”

She flicked my ear with her finger. “Focus, Dracula.”

I filled my lungs and tossed.

First ring clanged, bounced, rolled off. Second ring grazed the top. Third hit dead center and sprang back off to the floor.

She scooped up the fallen rings.

“Smooth,” she said. “Not hard.”

“Yeah, yeah. I got it.”

Jess snagged a spare ring and spun it on her finger. “Want some help?”

“I’ve got this.”

“You don’t got this,” she said, but she handed me the ring.

I loosened up, threw again, missed. The ring hit the table and spun like a coin. The woman caught it with two fingers and set it back with a little click.

“Hold still,” Jess said. She came around behind me and set her palms on my elbows. “You’re throwing like you’re trying to knock someone out. Pretend you’re dropping it down a tube.”

“What kind of tube?”

“An imaginary tube. Pretend you’re in science class.”

“We don’t have tubes in science class.”

“We literally do.”

She guided my arms. I eased the toss. The ring sailed cleaner and dropped over the neck of the front bottle, then hopped off like the bottle had shrugged.

The woman clicked her tongue. “That was better.”

“See?” Jess said. “Tube.”

“Tube,” I said, trying again. 

The fifth ring slipped over the bottleneck and stayed. It made this small sound, just a ring meeting glass. People nearby clapped like at a little league game. Jess squeezed my arm like she’d scored it herself.

The woman’s brows ticked up. “One more to move up to a medium prize.”

“How many for the bear?” I asked.

She pointed at the giant. “That one? You’ll need a clean three.”

My stamp had gone lighter in the sweat, like the ghost was getting tired. I rubbed at it with my thumb. It smudged a little.

“Don’t wipe it off,” the woman said.

“I’m not trying too.”

“Good.”

I set my feet. Jess slid back into spotter mode. “Tube,” she said near my ear.

“Tube,” I said again, and tossed. The ring kissed the neck and dropped clean. The woman raised her eyebrows a hair.

Just one more. 

“Steady,” Jess said.

“I’m good.”

“Don’t choke.”

I threw. The ring drifted, hit the neck, bounced, and then wobbled on the lip like it couldn’t make up its mind. 

Jess sucked in air. 

I didn’t breath. 

The ring settled, clinked down around the glass, and stayed.

I threw my hands up. Jess grabbed me. 

“Fair’s fair,” the older woman said, and pointed her cane at the bear. She tugged a pull string and the bear descended like a weird prop in a school play. 

Up close, the bear’s eyes were stitched with neat black buttons. It wore a pumpkin bowtie that was glued on a little too rambunctiously.

Jess took the bear’s paw. “Look at him! He’s perfect.”

“He’s a monster,” I said. “Look at those beady little eyes.”

“They’re cute.” She hugged it against her, then leaned the bear against her hip. She looked up at me through the brim of her hat. 

“What’s his name?”

“Mr. Corn Dog,” I said.

“No,” she said right away. “The heck's wrong with you? He looks like a Wallace.”

“Wallace it is.”

Wallace turned out to be a pain to carry.

He rode shotgun for a while, then Jess decided she had enough.

“He’s blocking my peripheral,” she said.

“Wallace is offended,” I told her.

“Wallace can chill in the raffle tent for a bit.”

We parked him next to a stack of pumpkins. A lady at the raffle table watched us.

“Be nice to him,” Jess told her. “Don’t let anyone take him.”

“I’m a nurse,” the lady said. “No one’s stealing your baby.”

Jess nudged my back. “Ferris wheel. Now.”

Up close, the wheel loomed taller, all ribs and spokes, slow as a whale turning.

An older lady in a quilted vest kept the line moving, saying, “Two by two,” like she was loading an ark.

“You two together?” she said when we stepped up.

“Yup,” Jess said.

“Careful in,” she said. “No rocking.”

I stepped up, grabbed the metal bar, and felt a sting on the back of my hand. Sharp. I looked down. There was a tiny burr on the rail, a mean little curl of metal. I’d scraped right across the stamp. 

The ghost was there, then not. A wet smear and a streak of red.

“Crap,” I said.

Jess was already sliding across the seat. “What?”

“Nothing.” I wiped at the ink. It came away pink with blood, then it was gone. No ghost. No welcome. Just a shiny patch of skin. “Just scratched myself.”

“Doofus. You alright?”

“I’m fine.”

The gray-braid lady locked the bar. “Phones away at the top,” she said. “It gets windy.”

We went up. The wheel groaned like an old door. 

Jess bumped her knee against mine. “Make sure you get a good view at the top.”

“Where do you think I should look?” I asked.

“You’ll look wherever I tell you to look.”

“Bossy witch.”

“Correct.”

The wheel carried us higher. Strings of bulbs turned into small constellations. From up here I could pick out the fireworks field, the auditorium’s dark block, the long line at the elephant-ear stand, and kids swarming like ants.

Wind threaded the metal and made a lonesome tune.

Jess stole a glance at me and half smiled.

“You finally made it here,” she said.

“Guess I did.”

“Worth the wait?”

“I think so.”

We paused near the top while they loaded more cars. Our seat rocked. Jess inched closer and leaned into me.

“Hey,” I said, because my mouth was moving before my brain. “Thanks for asking me.”

She fixed on me, not the town. “Yeah,” she said. “I’m glad you said yes.”

I kissed her. 

Not a big movie kiss. A little cautious, part surprise. She smiled against my face. A flag snapped somewhere below, and then we moved again.

When we reached the bottom, Jess stretched her arms like she’d claimed a peak.

“Best view in town,” she said.

“No complaints here,” I said.

Near the photo booth, a cluster of senior girls in glitter and capes and tiaras called names and waved people over.

“Picture time,” Jess said. “Senior girls’ group shot. Tradition.”

“You want me in it?” I asked.

“Nope. Just us. Meet at the fireworks, okay?” She tapped my chest. “Don’t get lost.”

“Lost? Me?”

“Yes, you. Stay near the crowds. I’ll find you.”

The girls pulled her in. Someone shouted, “Come on, witches in the front!” A phone flash went off. Then another. Jess turned and grinned at me before the crowd swallowed her.

I shoved my hands in my pockets. The scrape along the back burned. The skin felt raw.

The fireworks weren’t for another hour. So I wandered. I drifted toward the games and figured I’d hang there until the picture thing wrapped up.

It got crowded fast. 

Little kids with glow sticks kept darting under elbows. A dude in a werewolf mask tried to eat a churro through the snout and was failing. 

I drifted past the water gun races and the dart balloons, following the lights.

I ended up where the lights thinned. Fewer booths. More chain link fences.

A gravel lane traced the edge of the fair besides plastic barricades. Two girls worked the gap in the fence in black jackets labeled SECURITY written in white. I recognized one from graduation last year. Anna something. Softball team. The other wore a braid wound so tight it hurt my scalp to look at.

They were riffing about someone’s costume.

“Devil ears don’t count,” Anna said.

“Devil ears plus a tail,” the other girl said. “Don’t you think that’s at least trying?”

A guy wandered up to the plastic wall like he’d taken a wrong turn out of a bar. Early twenties. Work boots. Flannel over a hoodie. Evening stubble.

He lifted a hand. “Hey.”

“Couples only,” Braid said.

“Yeah, I know the drill,” he said. “My girl’s inside. She forgot her phone.”

Anna went still. “Name.”

“Jay,” he said.

“Her name,” Braid said.

He squinted like the lights were too bright. “Kelsey.”

Anna didn’t blink. “Last name.”

“Does it matter?” He pushed his fingers under the trespassing tape and lifted it over him. “I’ll be in and out.”

Braid smiled like a shark. “We can fetch her. You can wait right here after you give us her name.”

“Nah, it’s fine.” He stepped over the first barricade. “I’m just going to go grab her.”

Anna blocked him with an arm. “Don’t.”

He kept walking. “Relax. I’m local.”

Braid slid beside him. “Stop,” she said.

He laughed. “You girls gonna tackle me?”

Anna’s hand dipped to a pocket and came back with something pen-shaped. “No.”

He frowned. “What is that?”

“Security,” she said, and jabbed the base of his neck with the point like she was stamping a library card.

The guy winced. “Ow, hey.”

His knees went soft. He staggered two steps, reached for the barricade, missed, and sat down hard.

Anna turned to Braid. “Call Denise.”

Braid gave a small ‘okay’ and lifted her radio. “Perimeter three. We have a napper. Need a ride.”

The guy tried to say something and only managed a long sigh. His face tipped against the plastic drum and stayed there. His eyes began fishing.

“Whoa,” I said without meaning to.

Both girls turned toward the sound.

Anna’s brow pinched. “Hey. You. C’mere.”

I gave a quick no. “Nah. I’m good.”

“Now,” Braid said.

I shuffled forward like I’d just been called to the principal’s office. 

“Look, I didn’t see anything. I was just walking around.”

“Show me your hand,” Anna said.

“What?”

“Your stamp,” she said.

My stomach dropped. I lifted my hand anyway. Just skin, pink and raw.

Braid’s mouth tilted. “Where’s your ghost?”

“Got scraped off. I was on the wheel. The bar had this burr-”

Anna and Braid shared a quick exchange. Then Anna pulled the same pen-shaped thing she’d used on the guy.

“Hey, wait,” I said, stepping back. 

“Relax,” Anna said.

The pen jabbed my neck before I could duck. Cold fire ran down my arm. My legs buckled.

Last thing I caught was the Ferris wheel, white bones turning slow above the lights.

Then the ground rushed up and I was gone.

I woke under a web of pipes. Low tiled ceiling. Concrete walls slick with damp.

My wrists were tied to a metal chair with something like tough canvas. Two other guys sat strapped to chairs beside me.

On my left sat the guy from the barricades in flannel. On my right, a man I’ve seen sleeping behind the feed store with a shopping cart full of cans. He smelled like wet cigarettes.

“Hey,” I said, throat shot. “You guys okay?”

Flannel squinted and began to stir. “What the hell.”

The other guy mumbled, “I didn’t do nothing,” like he was talking to a cop.

I took my environment in. It was a basement under the auditorium. I recognized the stairs in the corner from pep rallies. There were bleachers on the far wall. 

On those bleachers, a ring of faces. Dozens. High school girls in dresses, costumes, jackets. Former students in black coats. Moms in soccer vests. Every one of them fixed on us like we were part of a show.

They were chattering, trading small smiles, holding hands over their knees. 

There was the softball girl from the cider tent. The track captain from the gate. Seniors from my English class. All the security girls. They wore festival grins, like a choir ready to sing before the first note.

“What’s happening?” I asked to the room.

My tongue felt furry. The room kept turning.

The lights cut. 

From the access tunnels behind us came a shuffle.

It didn’t sound like bootsteps. More like chicken feet on a wood. 

Three shapes slipped out of the dark tunnels. They wore the shape of old-women with something else mixed in. Bird-lean. Necks cocked, thin frames jutting, palms arched like talons. Faces long in the nose, bead-bright dots for pupils. Dresses that were church black, shiney with age.

Every move was a jerk, then still, then jerk again. 

The girls on the bleachers rose together, like someone had called for them to stand. Some of them brought their hands to their mouths. One older woman let out a wet cry and a laugh in the same breath.

Flannel cleared his throat. “Is this a prank?”

A graduate in a black coat told him, calm as a babysitter, “Please keep it down.”

The middle hag fixed on us. She didn’t blink, and when she spoke, it came out more croak than tune.

“Daughters,” she said. “Sisters. Here we keep what our mothers kept. Here we feed what our mothers fed.”

Another bird-woman took over, like they were sharing lines. “Men sow what women bless. Men harvest what women call up. Blood and seed. Boundary and promise.”

The third one smiled. Her teeth looked like tiny sharp pebbles. “The town keeps well because we keep it safe. You guard the gate. You guard the children. You keep the boys in their lane. You feed the fields so the crops don’t die.”

Someone on the bleachers said, “Amen.” Not church-serious. More like a team chant.

Flannel strained at his straps. “I just came for some food.”

A girl in a cape shouted, “No one asked you.”

He growled. “I live here, are you crazy?”

Anna from the security team said, “Then you know the rules about trespassing.” 

One of the hags glided forward. If you can call it gliding when the feet click the floor like claws. 

She leaned over Flannel and sniffed him. 

He tried to jerk away and the chair legs squealed. She tilted her head left, then right, twitching and firm, then opened her mouth wide.

He yelled, “Don’t,” and that just made it worse.

She bit. 

It was fast. 

A grab and a rip, like tearing a bag of dog food. His eyes went huge. Then his mouth opened and he made a sound that didn’t match any word I knew. Blood went everywhere. 

I flinched as it spotted my cheek.

Girls in the front row cheered and tossed handfuls of seeds on him, like rice after a wedding. Pumpkin. Sunflower. Corn. It stuck to him. It stuck to the floor. It stuck to my shoes. Blood ran over the little grains.

The homeless guy moaned, “Good God, Good God,” over and over.

I called out, “Stop. Please stop.” 

My voice bounced off cinderblock and came back small.

The girls kept cheering and shouted over me.

One shouted, “For the frost.” Another, “For the wells.” Somebody up top, “For the babies.”

The middle hag turned to me. 

She took my hand in both of hers. Her skin felt like paper that used to be wet and dried crumbled. She squinted at the back of my hand, still pink where the stamp should’ve been. She searched my face like she was reading a menu she didn’t like.

“You were invited, weren’t you?” she asked. The words came out pitched. Like her tongue didn’t sit right in her mouth.

“I was,” I said. “I swear. Jess asked me. Jessica Miller.” 

She studied the bald patch of skin. She drew my palm closer to her face. Old pennies and porch-feathers hit my nose. Her mouth worked. She opened wide. A tongue thin as a dry leaf slid out and licked the scab on my hand.

I panicked. “Jess,” I yelled. “Jess, I’m here.”

A ripple moved through the bleachers. Shoes scuffed. Then a girl’s voice cut through. Clear. Not loud, but everything stopped for it.

“He’s mine.”

A girl stepped out from the ring. Witch hat in her grip. Green ribbon at her throat.

Jess. 

She didn’t look scared. She had her argument face on. She came down the steps and stopped beside me. She set her fingers on my shoulder.

The hag froze with her mouth open, then shut it. Her attention snapped to Jess. They held each other for a long count.

“He belongs to me,” Jess said again. “I asked him. He came with me. I claim him.”

A murmur rolled around the room. 

The hag released my wrist. Her nails left bloody dents. A tiny caw caught in her throat, and she gave a single tilt, then stepped past me.

The homeless man started crying. “I didn’t mean to go past no fence,” he said. “I keep to the dumpsters. I didn’t mean to go past no fence.”

Jess squeezed my shoulder. “It’s okay.” She looked at the homeless man.

The third hag went to him. 

He tried to fold smaller in the chair. “Please,” he said, like a kid begging not to be given the belt from his father.

The hag asked the room, “Anyone make a claim?”

Silence. 

The girls looked straight ahead. A woman on the end folded her hands underneath her chin.

The hag asked again, “Any claim at all?”

A ripple of no’s swept the seats, even from the graduates. I turned to Jess. She met me straight on and pressed a finger to her lips.

The homeless man wept, “Please, I got no one.”

Seeds rustled in paper bags. 

The hag leaned in. She was careful about it, like a nurse with a shot. Then her head snapped down over the mans throat and that was that. 

Seeds and cheers flew again from the crowd. I turned my face away. They pattered off my jeans, my shoes, my cheeks. Salt and dirt and copper hit my tongue.

Up in the stands, someone started a low song. Not one I knew. Simple and old, like it only had four notes. The room answered with a chant.

Jess kept her palm on me like she had a leash on a stubborn dog. She said near my ear, “Stay with me. Take a deep breath. You’re doing fine.”

I tried. 

The air ran warm up my nose, rubber mats and death in it.

The middle hag stepped back and swept over us once more, her face coated red. Her chin tipped toward the ceiling like she was ticking boxes.

“Boundaries,” she said. “Gratitude. Harvest.”

The graduates gave small yeses. The security girls drew up taller. One used a sleeve to clear a wet corner of her eyes.

Jess leaned in close to my ear. “You’re doing good,” she said. “Don’t talk.”

My wrists hurt but I gave her one quick nod. Above us something popped. Test fireworks. The basement lights jittered.

Everyone rose like the last-period bells had just hit.

The hags turned toward the tunnels, slow, clicking the way crows do when they hop along a fence. The room fixed on their exit like a parade. They scooped bloody seeds as they went into the dark.

I didn’t say a word. Not then. I pinned the metal stairs in my sight and waited for the next thing.

Jess kept her hand on my shoulder while the room hummed. When the hags slid fully into the tunnels, someone on the bleachers called out that it was time to go home.

“Untie him, please,” Jess told one of the grads.

A woman in black stepped in, flicked a little blade, cut the canvas at my wrists. Skin peeled up in red crescents. I flexed my fingers and almost dropped to my knees when I tried to stand.

Jess lifted my arm like I was a child. “You good?”

“I don’t know.”

I looked over to see Flannel had been freed from his own chair and was now facedown in seeds. The older man still was tied up, eyes fixed on nothing with his mouth hung open like a mailbox. 

Girls stepped past both like they were cones on a track.

“Look at me,” Jess said, steadying me at the elbow. “Breathe.”

“Jess,” I said. “What is this.”

She tilted her head. “It’s the Fair.”

“That was murder.”

“They broke the rules,” she said. “Come on.”

Graduates moved first, then moms, then seniors. The whole pack stood, stretched, and chatted like a pep rally just ended.

Jess squeezed my arm. “Up the stairs.”

We climbed. My legs shook at the landings. 

The door opened to night air, laughter, and sugar smoke.

The fair spread out as bright as before, no smudge on it. Music drifted, a cheap dance playlist. Fireworks cracked another tester pop that made the little kids squeal. 

Nobody looked down. Nobody looked worried.

The senior girls poured out with us, fixing their hair, asking who had a charger. One of them bumped my shoulder. 

“Cute witch, Jess,” she said. “Love the ribbon.”

“Thanks,” Jess said, already towing me behind her toward the main walk. “Can’t chat. We’re late for the show.”

I followed her. “You’re acting like nothing weird just happened,” I said, trying to keep my words under the music.

She shot me that small give-it-a-rest face. “Come on, Rob. We’re here to have a good time.”

“They killed two people.”

“How many times do I have to say this, they were trespassing,” she said. “They had no right to be there. You had me.”

“I had you,” I repeated, and I hated how small that sounded.

She steered me back into the crowd.

Teens jostled. Freshmen ran with small stuffed animals. The Ferris wheel climbed and fell, blind and slow. I could feel my pulse in the scrape on my hand.

“Are you really okay?” I asked.

“I’m great,” she said. “Tonight went perfect.”

“Perfect?”

She angled her chin. “You’re alive. We’re together. The town’s safe. That’s perfect.”

We crossed the gravel. A group of seniors shouted for a group shot near the field. Jess waved. They waved back. Everybody looked fresh and bright.

At the clearing, the fireworks started in earnest. A thump in the chest, then a white flower spilled over the sky. Kids cheered. Couples leaned in.

We stood under the crackle and hiss. Jess slid in close. “I’m serious. I had a good time,” she said into my ear.

“That’s good,” I said. I heard my voice and wanted to kick it for sounding nervous.

She kissed my cheek. “You know, I asked you here because I like you. I have for a while. That hasn’t changed.”

I swallowed. “You took me here knowing about all of this?”

“Everyone knows,” she said. “Our moms. Our sisters. Our aunts. It keeps the town running. It keeps us fed.”

“What about them,” I said, tipping my chin toward the dark behind the auditorium. “They made one mistake.”

She shrugged. “They shouldn’t have pushed past the boundary. It’s sad. It happens.”

A green starburst fell and died over the parking lot. The crowd clapped.

“Can we go,” I said.

“After the finale,” she said. “It’s always the best part.”

We waited through the gold willows, the fast red pops, and the last massive one that made my ribs ring. Then the smoke drifted. The speakers cut. The fair clapped itself still.

Jess laced her fingers in mine and tugged me through the slow river of people. We collected Wallace from the raffle tent. The nurse lady winked. “He behaved.”

“Good bear,” Jess said, and laughed. It sounded normal, and something in me knotted.

We reached the parking lot. It was cold and smelled like damp grass and rock. We climbed into the truck. Jess set Wallace in the back seat and buckled him like a toddler.

I drove. 

My hands felt too big for the wheel. The road slid under us, black and easy, trees flashing like shutters. 

Jess talked like girls talk after dances. Who wore what. Who fainted on the tilt. Who is probably getting grounded. The whole time she sounded light, not fake, just light.

“You’re quiet,” she said.

“I’m thinking.”

“Don’t overthink it,” she said. “We had a good night.”

“Yeah,” I said.

We rolled into her street. Pumpkins on steps. That paper skeleton twitching on its string. I pulled up at the curb. The truck idled like a big dog.

She slipped the green ribbon off of her throat and it left a faint pale line on her skin.

She looped it around my right wrist when I put the truck in park. The knot kissed my pulse. It warmed me in a way I can’t explain. It was like a little door opened and a breeze came through with her name in it.

“What’s this?” I asked.

“A promise,” she said. “So you don’t forget me on the drive home.”

“I couldn’t,” I said. It came out fast and automatic.

I meant it. 

The ribbon sat there and my heart lined up with it like a drum with a new stick.

Her mom’s porch light clicked on. Her dad’s shape moved behind the screen. Jess leaned in and gave me one last kiss, small and sure.

“Text me when you get home,” she said. “Sweet dreams tonight.”

“Sweet dreams,” I said back.

She took Wallace by the paw and hopped down. 

The porch ate her in light. 

The door shut. 

I sat in the cab with the truck idling and the ribbon warm. I put both hands on the wheel. The knot of the bow pulsed with my pulse. It felt like happiness, simple and heavy. It felt like love.

I fixed on the road and let it settle. I loved her. I was sure of it. I was happy. I could not think of a single reason in the world why I shouldn’t be.",10,1759363440.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I'm imagining Raspberry Pi based ""tills"" with touch-screen monitors, and staff using (e.g.) Android phones with an app to take orders.

Am I being ridiculous or does software like this exist? Is it pay monthly or buy outright if so?

I have a feeling I'm being ridiculous but giving it a go anyway... otherwise, any other budget-friendly systems?

We have an old-school system that works, but everyone takes orders on the main tills, which creates backlog. Remote order entry would be good, with checks going to the appropriate printer (bar/coffee station/kitchen).

1nvotdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1nvotdo/starbucks_closes_san_jose_stores_as_competitor/,Starbucks closes San Jose stores as competitor moves in,"The recent closure of several Starbucks locations in San Jose, as the company streamlines its operations, reflects a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the coffee retail sector in the Bay Area. While Starbucks has historically enjoyed a dominant market position, its decision to shutter 1% of its stores across North America—including four locations in San Jose and others in nearby cities like Mountain View, Cupertino, and Milpitas—comes amid evolving consumer preferences and a growing trend towards localized coffee experiences.

The entry of Dutch Bros, a rapidly expanding coffee chain known for its drive-thru model and vibrant brand, into the San Jose market amidst these closures carries important implications for both the local economy and the commercial real estate landscape. For residents, this shift may signal a change in coffee culture, moving away from the familiar Starbucks experience toward a more diverse array of options that cater to local tastes and preferences. This aligns with a broader consumer trend favoring unique, locally-inspired brands over large, ubiquitous chains. Dutch Bros’ ability to attract a younger demographic, driven by social media engagement and community involvement, could further invigorate the local coffee scene, offering residents not just a beverage but an experience that resonates with their lifestyle.

From a business perspective, these closures and new openings may indicate a larger trend of market recalibration. Retail spaces, especially in high-traffic areas, may see a fluctuation in demand as traditional chains reassess their footprints in favor of more adaptive and responsive business models. The commercial real estate sector in the Bay Area, particularly in areas like San Jose, is already under pressure from rising rents and an evolving retail environment. Investors should consider this as a clarion call to reevaluate their portfolios, focusing on properties that can attract adaptable and innovative tenants rather than traditional retail giants that may be contracting.

The economic development implications are significant as well. With Starbucks reducing its presence, the potential for smaller, independent coffee shops to thrive increases. This could lead to a revitalization of local entrepreneurship, with opportunities for local business owners to fill the gap left by Starbucks. Additionally, the arrival of Dutch Bros may spur competition among coffee retailers, leading to more favorable pricing and options for consumers. This competition can also foster innovation within the local retail sector, as businesses strive to differentiate themselves through unique offerings and customer experiences.

Moreover, the shift in coffee retail dynamics may influence consumer behavior in related sectors, such as food and beverage, as customers seek out locales that offer a robust community vibe. Areas surrounding closed Starbucks locations may experience a temporary dip in foot traffic, but this could be offset by new coffee shops and eateries that capitalize on the changing landscape. Landlords and commercial property owners would do well to cater to this shift by considering flexibility in lease agreements and promoting smaller, community-focused businesses that can adapt to the evolving market.

Investors in the Bay Area should also monitor the demographics of the regions most affected by these closures. As tech workers increasingly opt for flexible work arrangements, coffee shops in suburban and semi-urban areas may see a rise in demand. The trend towards “coffee to go” and drive-thru options—exemplified by Dutch Bros—may define future retail strategies, compelling landlords and developers to rethink property designs to accommodate such models.

In conclusion, the closures of Starbucks in favor of new entrants like Dutch Bros in San Jose highlight a critical intersection of consumer preferences, competitive dynamics, and economic development. For residents, it means more choices and a potential uplift in the local business scene. For investors and property owners, it signals a need for agility and responsiveness to market trends that could reshape the fabric of commercial retail in the Bay Area. Engaging with these developments today could yield significant insights and opportunities for the future, as the Bay Area navigates an ever-changing economic landscape.

I have traditional Catholic values like kindness, loyalty, honesty, purity, and patience. I believe the best relationships are when you are both partners and best friends.

I’m an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. My passion is fantasy novel writing, but I care about physical and mental health.

I'm studying the language and working toward JLPT N1, with the long-term goal of teaching English there.

I date to marry. I want a woman who's waiting for right person and who values building a bond built on trust, respect, and faithfulness.

**Age range:** 20-30 preferred.

1nvoqjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1nvoqjq/it_happens_all_the_time/,It happens all the time,"This story isn't mine to tell, it was told to me by my best friend. Derek probably wouldn't even want me to tell this story, but I feel that it needs to be told. I got a call from Derek late one night from the hospital. ""I have something I have to tell you."" He sounded desperate, frantic even. 

Derek hit an all-time low point in his life a while before this. This is the kind of trauma that manifests itself in the form of self-destructive tendencies. Being plowed into by a drunk driver shortly after getting married can do that to a man. He lived, she didn't. Needless to say, it drove him into a level of despair that can't be described in words. 

When I arrived at his room he was staring off into space with a blank, distant expression. As he turned to me I realized just how bad he looked. His eyes were bloodshot with bags under them. After a few moments his numb, emotionless demeanor changed into frantic sobs, Without saying a word I wrapped him in a hug and tried to console him. He eventually calmed down enough for me to sit and talk. ""What happened man?"" I asked, as delicately as possible.

He looked at me once again, a pained expression on his face. When he spoke his voice sounded shaky. This is the story he told me.

I guess you could say it all started when she died. I kind of lost motivation to continue the same routine I was used to. I started missing work, shut out my family, and started drinking heavily. After a month or so of the same routine, I subsequently lost my job. Things only got worse. Pills, then eventually heavier drugs took hold. And then this...

My first memory of this experience was being in a stupor one night, the kind that makes you forget where you are momentarily. The room was cold, not uncommon for a seedy motel. I heard a knock at the door, I stood to turn the light on, the dull yellow bulb casting a glow that reminded me of an old sepia-type movie, but as I went to look through the peephole I saw nothing. I opened the door, scanning the breezeway... Nobody was there. 

Shaking my head I shut the door and I walked my way over the cold floor to the bathroom. I had a very strange feeling, like the room around me felt lifeless.

I flipped the switch on the wall, immediately I saw that the bathroom took on the same eerie tone. My reflection stared back at me, making me realize just how exhausted I looked. I took a moment to splash water on my face to clear my thoughts. Suddenly I thought I'd heard something. I stood stock still. I could've sworn I'd heard the shuffling of feet. The bathroom light suddenly turned off.

I was becoming Ill with fear. The light from under the door began to flicker with a strange buzzing sound. I cautiously peeked around the door, like a child with an overactive imagination. 

I had barely peeked around the door when suddenly the light turned off, and now both lights were out, plunging the room into darkness. Just before the light went out I thought I saw a figure in the corner of the room. Creeping cautiously toward the light chain, I fumbled for it in the darkness. I pulled on it and to my unease, nothing happened. I stood motionless, completely freaked out. 

I jumped with a start when the white noise and grey glow of the TV came blaring on again. Then I thought I'd heard something else. Beneath the white noise was a different sound. I stopped and listened. 

The sound was mostly drowned out but it was there. Holding my breath I inched closer to the screen, and as I did so the sound became clearer. Fading in and out was… some sort of screaming. It seemed as though there were dozens of them wailing. I stood there, hand outstretched toward the power button, the sound of agonizing screams rose and fell within the white noise.

Just as I was about to unplug the tv, it turned off on its own. The screen went black. It was too quiet. It seemed as though the silence was even more unnerving than the noise. I slowly inched back toward the light chain. I didn't take my eyes off the TV even though it was pitch black. I was shaking but doing my best to convince myself it was just a faulty tv.

""Piece of shit.""  The sounds of screaming were most likely a horror movie on a channel with a bad signal. I reached for the chain still shaking slightly, praying it would work this time. I sighed with relief as the light came to life. Just as I turned towards the bed, I was met with the breath of something inches from my face.

His complexion was sickly pale, almost matching his gray hair. the face was sunken and emotionless. It was a brief first encounter but I'll remember that face for eternity. At that moment I felt like I was staring death in the face “Don't worry, that happens all the time.” he said. I looked down, in his right hand was a knife, covered in blood. 

Just then the tv came blaring with those awful screams. I can only describe the man in front of me as being a shell of a human, an unbelievably ancient-looking man whose grey hair was long and stringy.

I stood paralyzed as I looked into the black pit where his eyes should be. Suddenly I was aware of another sound, the heavy footsteps of something large could be heard somewhere beyond the door, accompanied by an inhuman wail. Just as soon as I was aware of it, I bolted upright in bed, almost falling off of it… I was at home… 

My heart racing as well as my breathing. My jaw hurt as if I'd been grinding my teeth. It was clearly a nightmare. 

The feeling, though, even now that I was awake in my own home, seemed to linger. I was no stranger to bad dreams, but as far as I can remember, before she died I had never had nightmares such as these.

I swallowed hard realizing my mouth was dry and went downstairs for a glass of water. I racked my brain for any memory that involved the motel In the dream. It felt familiar in a way couldn't grasp as I walked back to my room. 
 
I lay awake thinking about the nightmare,  I couldn't stop thinking about the eyes of the man, or the lack thereof. Other thoughts crept into my mind and eventually drifted toward abstract thoughts as sleep took over. Suddenly the sound of something invaded my eardrums, and for the second time I found myself back in the motel room.

I was immediately aware of the fact that I could only move my eyes as I looked toward the direction of the sound, whatever it was seemed to be coming up the stairs. I could hear several thumps reverberating from the metal stairs. I listened, paralyzed and terrified as I heard the sound growing in volume as it made its way up the stairs, sounding as if it were crawling, accompanied by what could only be described as the cracking and popping of bones. 

As it got closer I could hear the sound of deep gurgling and wheezing, like that of a sickly and choking creature. It stopped just a few feet before the window as I still couldn't see any shadow beyond the curtain, and the light outside my door started to flicker. I heard the sound of a door handle turning, I lay paralyzed in fear,  but as I heard a door creak open I realized that it was coming from the direction of the neighboring room. I still could only move my eyes as I stared toward the flickering light. 

My ears were met by the muffled sound of moaning and confused shouts from the voice of a man through the wall behind me. The shouts evolved into terrified shrieks. I could still hear the thing breathing, only seeming to get more excited. My heart pounded as I could do nothing but listen as the terrified cries turning to muffled screaming, and then gurgled choking accompanied by cracking and wet crunching. 

All sound went quiet aside from the heavy breathing of the thing as I lay in silence still struggling to move. Once again I heard the footsteps of the thing as it seemed to leave the room. I prayed silently that it wouldn't come my way. 

My eyes were shut tight for what seemed like an eternity until I realized that everything was silent. Opening my eyes I looked first toward the window, still unable to move my body, the light was no longer flickering beyond the curtain. 

I looked to the edge of the bed, and to my horror, there stood the old man, illuminated only by the light from the breezeway. ""Don't worry, that happens all the time."" That's when I heard a tapping, slowly looked in the direction of the window and saw a silhouette that was unlike anything I'd seen, humanoid in shape, yet it was anything but human, it looked as though it was standing, only with its back hunched over. It was standing at an angle where I could see an unnaturally long neck with it's head seemingly facing toward me.

Something smashed against the window with a crunch, leaving a dark splatter on the other side. I would have screamed if only I had the ability. With another sickening splat, I could make out the form of what was being slammed into the window… The shape of a human head was being held by the hair. ""Please stop"" I prayed silently. 

Almost as if the thing reacted to my thoughts, it immediately stopped. In a raspy, distorted voice, the thing spoke ""you couldn't imagine the things he will do to you."" Dropping the mangled head, it moved away from the window, and towards the door to my room. I laid paralyzed as the handle twisted. 

I was awake almost immediately, woken by the sound of thunder. I reached over to turn on the bedside lamp, to realize that it wouldn't turn on. ""Of course"" I'd said aloud. The storm had knocked out the power. All was silent except for the sound of rain and thunder. I looked at my phone to find that it was 3 a.m.

I rubbed my eyes trying to shake the residual sense of unease. Sitting in the darkness wasn't helping at all, so I decided to go downstairs and to the front porch to see if the other houses had lost power. 

I sat on the porch and watched the rain as it poured, all other houses were dark. What struck me as odd was that all of the houses seemed vacant, no cars in the driveways. And then I looked down the street towards the end of the block. I noticed the vague form of something in the road. 
The sky was a dark with storm clouds, the only illumination was that of the moon behind the thick clouds, casting an eerie glow upon them. With a flash of lightning I caught a glimpse of a figure standing at the end of the block in the middle of the road. I squinted to try and make out any details. It looked to be the figure of a very tall man. 

After a few moments of squinting into the dark wall of rain I began to turn back towards the door, but just as I did a flash once again illuminated the figure in the road, only much closer. It seemed like the only way for him to be that much closer was as if he was sprinting down the road toward me. 

I took a few steps back, my hand finding the door knob, still staring in the direction of the figure. My eyes were trained on the spot I'd last seen the figure, and as another flash lit the sky I saw nothing. I turned the knob and went inside, locking the door behind me. 

I wiped the rain from my face with a sigh, feeling the weight of exhaustion. I sat on the couch and laid my head back, staring through the darkness. I thought of my wife, and the last time I'd seen her face. I didn't like the darkness, nor the quiet, for fear of being left with my thoughts. I felt like I had to keep moving, at least until the power came back. Maybe I was afraid of the nightmares to creep their way back in.

I don't know how long I'd paced until I decided to call the electric company. It rang a few times before being forwarded to a message, ""if you're experiencing a power outage, please be patient, we're in the process of fixing the issue."" Just as I took the phone from my ear I thought I'd heard something. ""Don't worry, it happens all the time"". I put the phone back to my ear ""Power outages are common during this weather, we will have your electricity restored as soon as possible.""

As eerie as it was to hear those words, I had to chalk it up to a coincidence. I sat down on the couch in the dark, with only the flashing of lightning illuminating my surroundings. My eyes were heavy. Thoughts began to blur together as sleep took me despite my attempts to prevent it. 

I found myself walking down a road, on either side were nothing but tall trees. The woods were thick and rarely were there any breaks to seeing you much of anything beyond the treeline. The road stretched on and on with no end in sight. Looking to my right I realized my wife and I were holding hands. 

She gazed straight ahead smiling, I couldn't take my eyes off her. It was lightly raining, reminding me of the walks we used to take. Suddenly she stopped walking and her smile faded, her expression turning serious. “You need  to wake up.” I followed her gaze. 

Down the road about a football field away I saw a figure. It looked familiar, like the one I'd seen on the lightning-lit road. Freakishly tall and emaciated, its arms were longer than any human, as were the legs. As terrifying as it was, I didn't want to leave. “I don't want to wake up.” I said a bit choked up. “No I mean really... wake up.” She said. 

Looking ahead again I was startled by the fact that the thing was noticeably closer. Its head cocked to one side and its torso contorted at an inhuman angle. “I don't…” I trailed off. Looking left, I found that the trees were gone, and in their place was the familiar motel building from my previous nightmare.

There was only one building and had only twelve rooms for each of the two floors, rusted metal stairs led up to the second floor. The only other building was the dilapidated office. 

My attention was caught by the windows of the eerie place. The curtains were drawn to reveal the darkness,  but I could see the faint silhouettes of someone or something. It seemed as though they occupied every window of the building. 

A flicker of yellow light flashed from within a room on the second floor, the faint flash illuminated the same man from my dream. His eyeless gaze focused directly on me, as I looked forward again, the creature was maybe 50 yards away now. I stood terrified as it emitted an inhuman wail. It seemed like a blanket of darkness followed it. I looked back at my wife, suddenly her mouth opened, emitting a loud sound of white noise. My eyes snapped open. 

The sound of my phone ringing woke me. It was my brother. I hesitated, I wanted to talk to someone, to anyone, but how do you explain to someone that you may or may not be insane?

After a few moments, the ringing stopped and I sighed. I stared at my phone, contemplating whether or not I should call back. Just as I reached for the phone it rang once more, making me jump.

""hey bro what's going on?"" I said. ""Oh same shit different day, just thought I'd call and see if you were still alive."" Something about what he said made me feel uneasy. ""Yeah um… yeah I'm ok, just taking it day by day,"" I responded. ""You sound tired, are you sure everything is ok?"" He asked. ""Yeah, just a bit annoyed, the power is out and I've been waiting for it to come back on."" He chuckled at that one. ""Don't worry, that happens all the time."" He said. My blood went cold. ""What did you say?"". ""Awe what's the matter, are you scared of the dark?"" His voice was warped. 

I dropped my phone as the sounds of white noise and the familiar screams filled the air. I jumped up and ran up the stairs as the sounds seemed to follow me. I slammed the door and huddled in the corner with my eyes shut tight and my hands covering my ears, I could feel the floor shake as if something monstrous was coming up the stairs. Then after several seconds passed I realized that they were gone. I dared not move, worried that somehow I might once again hear the horrible noises that filled my ears only moments before. Several minutes passed, and I finally managed to stand, still shaken. 

The way things were going, the nightmares, the noises, the whole experience seemed impossible to comprehend in any sane manner. 

I headed down the stairs and into the kitchen, opening the fridge I squinted, and spotted the six-pack on the top shelf in the dark, as I closed the refrigerator door I stopped, something was odd. Opening it I was met with the odor of spoiled meat.  ""What the fu-"" I trailed off. How was it that the contents of the fridge had already gone bad? How long has it been without power? 

Had it been long enough for it to spoil everything? Ultimately I tried to convince myself that it must have been acting up before the power outage. I sighed, practically dragging my feet over to the couch. 

The rain was still coming down heavily, not letting up for an instant. The lightning was still the only source of light, I just stared at nothing. The events of the night were weighing heavily on my mental state, even if it was just my sleep-addled brain causing these things they were nevertheless bothering me. I finished my beer and went to grab another. 

After doing so I suddenly remembered dropping my phone, so I walked over to where I was standing and squinted through the darkness. I felt along the floor for a minute or so to no avail. Upon standing back up I happened to glimpse something on the coffee table. It was my phone. 

I considered calling the electric company again but decided that nothing I could say would make any difference. Not to mention I was paranoid of what I might hear. I went to grab another beer. I felt a bit cooped up so I went to sit on the porch.watching the rain as it poured endlessly. Even though it knocked out the power, I loved thunderstorms, and despite everything, I started to relax a bit. 

Ever so often I'd still get the eerie feeling that I'd once again see the figure in the street, but thankfully I saw nothing save for the torrents of rain and lightning. 

Still staring in the direction of where I'd seen the figure I saw what seemed to be the flickering of a street light.

I stood to my feet. In hope that this may be a sign that the power was being restored, I turned around and stepped into the house to see if they worked. I was immediately met with confusion, I was back in the motel room. I turned to find that the door wouldn't budge. 

I could hear some conversation coming from beyond the wall behind the bedpost. Someone was talking in the next room over. The muffled exchanges sounded like the mundane conversation of two friends. 

As I crept closer the verbal exchanges became strange, gradually morphing into something else entirely.
  
I was slightly able to hear bits and pieces of the conversation, though jumbled together as if they were both speaking at once. Then everything went silent for a moment as I stood still. ""He doesn't think we know he's listening."" They both spoke at once, their voices warped into one inhuman tone. ""And he doesn't know he's coming, very soon."" 

I stood frozen as I heard movement from the other room, I felt sick. The two voices whispered incomprehensibly, both giggling in their warped voices. Then strangely the two voices started humming. Some haunting melody that was made all the more creepy by the inhuman voices. 

I noticed that the humming was moving closer, and soon I heard scratching on the other side of the wall, only a couple of feet away. The voices abruptly stopped… tap….tap...tap. then “why not invite us in?” I then heard scratching again. Only this time it scraped along the wall, moving toward the conjoining door. 

I instinctively scrambled to the closet in the room. I prayed silently that the door to the conjoined room was locked. To my horror, I heard the knob turn slowly. The old door creaked open loudly.  Bare feet were heard slapping against the floor as the creature crept toward the closet door, stopping just feet from it.

I could hear ragged breathing as the thing stood at the door. My blood froze in my veins as I heard the knob slowly turn and the closet door creaked open.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room, and standing just inches from me was something almost indescribable. A naked and mutated monstrosity. I could see the thin form of some ungodly creature, it's spine exposed and arched unnaturally where the spine meets the ribcage, its legs arched backward like that of an animal, and an outstretched hand with too many fingers. 

Two bald heads outstretched from long necks, their jaws hung loosely and were too long, both smiling, with needle-like teeth. Two large white eyes extruded from each face as if there were no sockets at all. All I could do was shut my eyes, too scared to move for an eternity.

I opened my eyes to find myself back in my room, huddled in the corner. I stood, still shaking. I couldn't tell what was real anymore. At this point, I wanted nothing more than for the power to return so that I wouldn't be in the dark. I paced back and forth across the bedroom floor, trying to keep moving.

Snapping me out of my daze I heard knocking from downstairs. I waited a few moments until I once again heard the knocking. Once I got to the bottom I heard a woman's voice from the other side of the door. ""Hello? Please can you help me?"" I paused. ""What do you need?"" I demanded, sounding a bit shaky. ""I was wondering if you had any batteries for a flashlight."" I paused once more. Then she knocked again. ""Please, my kids are afraid of the dark."" I sighed. ""Ok,"" I said. 

It seemed to be the most harmless encounter of the entire night, only just as I turned I realized something that stopped me in my tracks. Why had the knocking sounded like it came from the bottom of the door? I slowly crouched down to peek under the door. I immediately regretted it. I was met with a deformed, vaguely human head, missing its bottom jaw, the top part of the jaw extended out, teeth jutted out at various angles, and grew in various places. There was a gaping hole where the eyes and nose should be, and the cavity was filled with maggots. Before I could react, a long black tongue snaked out of its mouth and underneath the door, making contact with my face, the smell was indescribably awful. 

Just as I tried to move away I fell. Cautiously peeking under the door I saw nothing, and the knocking had seized. I was confused, exhausted and terrified. 

I decided then and there that I was too sleep deprived and there was nothing I could do to prevent these things to manifest themselves in countless and horrific ways. I sluggishly moved to the nightstand where there sat a picture, the only one I had. My wife and I embraced one another. 

I pulled out my phone so that the light from it illuminated her face. Tears filled my eyes. Just before I was about to shut off the phone I saw something that caught my attention, the time on the phone read 3 a.m. just as it had some time ago. 

I suddenly realized I didn't know how long it had been since the power went out but I knew it should be daylight out, however, the darkness and the storm raged on with no sign of any light behind the thick clouds, aside from the faint glow of the moon. I couldn't take any more, I was way too far down the rabbit hole. I crawled into bed and shut my eyes. I'd soon find that it was a mistake. I found myself on the road again, standing in front of the motel. Only without my wife, and the darkness that followed the creature in the previous dream enveloped everything as far as the eye could see. 

Lightning flashed constantly making it possible for me to see the curtains of the rooms were drawn open, save for one. Only one door was open, the one with the flickering light. I felt I had to approach. As I walked towards the stairs I heard a familiar giggle to my right. I gazed in the direction of the sound I caught a glimpse of two familiar heads peeking around the corner of the building. 

They continued to chuckle in the same distorted voice as if they were holding in a secret. I turned and continued towards the stairs.I didn't know what I expected to find but carried on anyways. The fear grew stronger as I passed by every room, seeing horrible things through their windows with every flash. Blood painted the walls, dismembered body parts were strewn about the floor. Walking past a window a few rooms down from the open door, terror filled my heart as I witnessed an inhuman creature ripping flesh from the writhing body of a man. His limbs were removed, and his eyes were gouged out, yet he was alive, and screaming. I could do nothing more than continue on. 

I stopped at the window of the conjoined room, looking at dismembered corpse of a man. Looking in front of me I saw something that made me want to vomit. A human head lay on the floor of the breezeway, the face of the man was obliterated and broken to unrecognition. Teeth were scattered around the head in a pool of blood and brain matter.

I heard a giggle that made me turn around, the two headed monstrosity stood at the end by the stairs, watching me. I turned and once again continued to the next room. My heart raced faster than ever as I approached the open door. I peered through, my eyes darting around. I reluctantly crept into the room.

To my immediate horror, the door behind me shut, plunging the room into darkness. I heard a noise, it sounded like breathing, coming from the direction of the bed. I slowly backed away toward the door reaching for the handle. As I did so the sound of breathing stopped, for a moment the room was silent.

The TV came on, emitting the familiar white noise. Laying on the bed I sawthe body of a man, it didn't take long before I recognized the face… it was me, laying on my back, eyes rolled to the back of my head, completely still. Standing beside my body was something so unimaginable that my mind couldn't comprehend it. It's eyes alone were enough to destroy the soul of anyone. They were pitch black and very large. 

I recognized the form of the being, it was the creature that approached me from the dream of my wife. It was freakishly tall with long thin arms and legs that were inverted. The creature's eyes bore into my very being, The expression on it's face was one of cold indifference, though still somehow pure evil. It's features were indescribably horrific. if the old man with no eyes resembled death, this…. thing's eyes resembled hell. It slowly approached. 

I felt as though I was looking into the deepest depths of hell. I couldn't scream… my voice failed me. It stopped in front of me, tilting it's head to the side. The mouth of the thing slowly opened unnaturally wide, deafening sounds of agonizing screams filled my ears as it reached for me with it's black claws. At that moment I knew I was going to be consumed down to my very soul, and again, I could do nothing to stop it. So I closed my eyes and covered my face, anticipating  whatever fate awaited me. Then everything went silent. 

I opened my eyes, confused. I soon realized I was I was sprawled out on the floor at home next to my bed, a light shone throughout my bedroom. 

I slowly climbed to my feet. Looking toward the window and saw sunlight trickling in through the curtain. I reached for my phone. I breathed a sigh of relief. It was 9:46 a.m.

I felt a little rested, though still groggy. My mind wandered for a while before I finally stood up to go downstairs. As I reached the bottom steps I flipped the switch to the living room. The electricity was restored. I took a deep breath in relief. Satisfied, I moved toward the door and opened it…. My stomach dropped. I stepped out. I realized I was looking over the rail of the motel's breezeway. The scenery before me was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life. One glimpse of what I saw was enough to destroy anyone to their core. 

Countless bodies, as far as the eye could see were writhing and screaming far below me in an endless river. Waves of lava tossed bodies in every direction,  faces were melted, eyes were missing, feeling every inch of their bodies being broiled. The sky was a swirling vortex of blackness and fire and rained more bodies into the vast river of magma that stretched as far as the eyes could see.

Some were trying to climb onto other people to escape the torture, only to once again sink into the melted rock again, and again. On either side of the pit were rock formations and low mountains. As I gazed at them I could make out the forms of countless grotesque creatures doing unspeakable things to countless people. Some were being held over blazing fires by their feet, some were being dismembered, their skin being peeled away slowly. Some were sewn to one another with various other limbs attached in the wrong places, some were being eaten, or forced to eat themselves. Blood and body parts were strewn about the cliffs.


A familiar voice behind me interrupted my catatonic state. ""If hell wants you, no matter how much you run, hell finds you. It happens all the time."" I turned to see the old man, he had a blank look on his face. He raised a hand, pointing somewhere behind me, I once again turned to look as a massive tidal wave of fire and lava was approaching, the floor began to quake violently as the walls of the building started to crack and crumble, the structure beneath me was about to give way. As I looked down, to my horror I saw charred black hands with exposed glistening bone reaching for me as they climbed the railing. At the last moment I heard another familiar voice. ""Wake up!!!"" 

All was quiet. I slowly opened my eyes, my vision was too blurry to see anything in detail, though I could make out vague silhouettes of people. I could feel something helping me breathe. After a few moments I drifted off again

When I awoke next I almost immediately started to panic. I bolted upright, finding wires and tubes and shit connected to me. Then I heard a new voice  ""Calm down, you're ok, you're in a hospital, you suffered heart failure and we had to resuscitate you. 

They explained to me that I had been stabbed, 4 times by someone in a motel room. I dialed 911 just moments before I lost consciousness and my heart stopped. Luckily there was an ambulance nearby. I was dead for around 3 or 4 minutes, that's where they found me.

That was the conclusion of Derek's story. He begged me to believe him as I embraced him. He insisted that regardless of who had stabbed him, and even admitting that it could have been a drug deal gone wrong even though he had no memory of it, the experience he had in death was very real. But ultimately he believed that when he died, every time he'd awoken back in his own home, that was his attempt to escape, he swore on his very existence that hell was after him. He told me that he still sees these countless horrors in his dreams, and fears the day that he may have to face them again. 

A few weeks later I got a call from Derek. He'd left his wallet in the room, and there was no way he was going back there. So of course I opted to retrieve it for him. This motel was indeed in the middle of nowhere. 

When I arrived I was uneasy. The place was damn near dilapidated to begin with, but reimagining the details of his experience made it all the more unsettling. The lot was almost empty. 

As I entered the office the smell of mold invaded my nose, the lights were dim and gave off an eerie sort of tone. ""Can I help you?"" The scratchy voice of an older woman spoke. ""Yes ma'am, a friend of mine rented a room here, he had been stabbed and had to call an ambulance, anyways he received a call from here regarding his wallet being-"" I was cut off by the woman tossing something to me. I opened it to see that it was indeed his wallet. She had no emotion. 

After I got back in my car I was about to leave, but hesitated. I noticed the other rooms had no light outside their doors besides this one. Curiosity got the best of me as I got out and walked towards the stairs. 

I climbed the stairs, making my way across the breezeway until I reached the room. I don't know what I expected to find but I peeked through the edges of the curtains. It was pitch black. The aura of the place felt lifeless, just as Derek had described.
""Got a light?"" I almost leaped out of my skin. 

Standing in the blanket of darkness to my right was the silhouette of a man, hidden in shadow, his shape only illuminated by the pale moonlight. ""Y….yeah."". I reached into my pocket to retrieve my lighter. I lit his cigarette for him, straining to see any details of the stranger, but saw nothing. 

A buzzing sound interrupted my thoughts. I turned to gaze at the yellow bulb next to the door as it flickered. The whole situation made me uneasy. ""Don't worry, that happens all the time."" I quickly turned my head towards the man, but he was gone. At my feet I noticed something that turned my veins to ice... a bloody knife, and a lit cigarette. I never returned to the place again. As for Derek, I don't think he recovered from his experience, I don't think he ever will.",1,1759363215.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1nvoq0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1nvoq0c/i_was_laptopping_at_a_coffee_shop_with_my_back/,i was laptopping at a coffee shop with my back leaning against the window when I heard a loud bang and felt an impact in my back.,"My first thought was that a homeless man had attacked me. Everyone in the busy cafe was in shock. I turned around and there was a pigeon on the ground, and it crawled one or two inches with its wings outstretched partally and its head reaching up and I watched as its life slowly left it's body. At first it crawled, in a way uncharacteristic for a pigeon, but then it started to resemble more a statue, and as the life left its wide open eyes it was finally a corpse, another piece of trash on the dirty city sidewalk.

My back really hurt. I turned around again and said that it was a bird. Everyone did that awkward thing where they watch the bird die after it hits a window. Some people walked outside but by that time it was already dead. I felt like I was the only one to watch it's life leave it's body. Maybe I should have rushed outside to comfort it in its last few seconds on Earth. I felt bad about this and couldn't stop looking at it.

I couldn't really tell if its neck was broken or not. It's eyes were open and it made me uncomfortable to sit there. It could see me while I worked on my laptop. I didn't want to move though either, I felt bad. Everyone else seemed like they forgot about it but my back still hurt and my heart rate was elevated, since I thought I was getting attacked by a homeless man. To soothe myself a bit I googled about how birds die when they hit windows. I kept turning around and looking at it and wondering if people noticed me doing this.

I'm still relieved I didn't get attacked by a homeless man but I don't think I will sit with my back against the window ever again. I can't help but imagine being paralyzed from the waist down because a homeless man broke through the window of a gentrifier café and attacked me, that would be so embarrassing to tell people. Not worth the risk",14,1759363174.0,redscarepod,3,0.89,False

###Investigations
---

**Daily Planet**

---

“This has to be about me,” said Clark. “Someone’s been taking people close to me.”

First, Jimmy Olsen was taken. Then, Cat Grant after Clark interviewed her. After that, Eddie, a friendly barista at Planet News Café, didn’t show up for his shift. He wasn’t confirmed to be missing yet, but he’d fit the bill. The latest abduction sealed the deal, though.

“Mr. White’s been taken?” Ron Troupe asked at the editor-in-chief’s door.

The panic spread quickly across the bullpen.

“Is this an attack?” someone asked.

“Should we evacuate?” another added

“Call the police,” Lois answered, patting Ron on the shoulder as she rushed by. “Hey!” she yelled, drawing a few stares her way. She placed two fingers in her mouth and let out a sharp whistle, immediately quieting down the room.

“That’s better,” said Lois. “Listen up, Perry’s been taken, but we still have a job to do. This is connected to the recent robot attacks. Find out whatever you can and send it to my desk.”

Clark approached his wife as the bullpen returned to life. “What can I do?” he asked.

“Get back to that maintenance station,” Lois replied. “Someone must have seen something around there that could help.”

“On it,” Clark affirmed. “What will you do?” he asked.

“I’ll do another run-through of Cat’s notes,” she answered. “She was investigating this before she was taken. There has to be something else in there to point us in another direction.”

Clark nodded and headed for the stairs, pulling out his phone on the way.

If this were about Clark Kent, others close to him could be the next target. The Kent farm had defenses built in, but those robots could get through before he could make it there. And, while he could keep an eye on his kids, Jon and Lara, while he’s still in Metropolis, he’d feel better having someone stay close.

“Kara,” said Clark as soon as she answered. “I need coverage on the family. Is Linda there, too?”

“Yes,” Kara answered. “What’s going on?”

Clark reached the rooftop, ripping open his shirt to reveal his Superman suit underneath. “That’s what we’re going to find out.”

**Elsewhere**

*Meanwhile*

---

The captor had left the room where Perry, Jimmy, Cat, and Eddie were being held in a cell, settled on the cold floor. Their jailor never came close enough for them to see, but Perry recognized the voice when he spoke to them.

“Superman *will* find us, won’t he?” asked Jimmy.

“I’m sure he will, son,” said Perry. “But, we can’t count on that.”

“What other chance do we have?” asked Eddie, his voice screeching uncontrollably a bit.

Cat stood up and held onto a couple of the rusted iron bars. “We find a way out of here ourselves,” she said.

“There’s that Cat Grant mettle,” Perry applauded. “You know, the Planet’s never been the same without you.”

“I *know*,” Cat quipped, pulling on one of the bars. But it wouldn’t budge.

“Why did he even take me?” asked Eddie, losing control of his breath. “I’m not a reporter like you guys.”

“It’s Clark,” said Jimmy. “I’m his best friend, he had just interviewed Cat, Eddie’s his favorite barista–”

“I am?” Eddie interrupted to ask.

“Not the point,” said Jimmy. “And Perry’s his chief– I mean boss.”

“I’m not quite sure,” said Perry.

“Is there something you’re not sharing with the class?” Cat broke in, walking the perimeter of the cell, putting her hands over each bar. She nearly fell over when one of them jiggled. “Hold that thought.” She motioned the others to her side. “Help me,” she said, pulling as hard as she could.

**Suicide Slum**

*Later*

“I’ve never seen anyone head down that way,” a young woman answered as Clark jotted down some notes.

“Thanks for your time,” said Clark.

“Yeah, whatever,” the woman replied, heading away.

The interviews were going nowhere. Lois had previously suggested that some CCTV coverage could have picked something up, but there didn’t appear to be any cameras pointed toward areas that headed underground.

Hopefully, Lois or someone else at the Planet was having better luck.

Clark sighed and put away his notepad. Maybe another look underground could find something he missed. As he headed toward the nearby subway entrance, a storefront for Hob’s Bay Spirits caught his eye. There wasn’t a camera, but there was an abnormal cavity in the concrete facade.

Telescopic vision revealed it wasn’t a bullet hole, unfortunately, uncommon for the area. Just inside was a torn wire. Could there have been a camera there before?

“*Hmm*,” said Clark, approaching the darkened liquor store. There was a sign in front that read “Closed until further notice,” and a chain over the rolled-down security gate.

Clark looked inside, scanning the store. His eyes moved quickly to the floor by the counter, which was covered in broken glass. Was there a struggle in there?

“Oh no,” said Clark when he discovered a body behind the counter. He took a quick look around to ensure the coast was clear and broke the chain, proceeding to roll up the gate and then push the door open off its hinges.

The man had been dead a while, the sign on the door seemingly keeping away anyone from noticing. It was a shame nobody reported him missing, since his store would be the first place they’d look.

Clark rushed into the back office, booting up the computer. He quickly found an app for camera feeds. There was one above the counter, overlooking the interior, and another outside where the hole was found.

Clark’s phone rang, and he quickly answered it.

“Lois,” he said. “I think I’m onto something. I found some tampered security cameras. Whatever it captured must be important. Unfortunately, someone was killed to keep it from getting out.”

“That’s great, Smallville,” said Lois. “*Er*, not the murder, of course. Keep me posted.”

Clark typed away, trying to bring up the logs, but there was nothing there. Someone must have erased them.

“Will do,” Clark agreed. “But this may be harder than I thought. How are things are your end?”

“I’ve been over and over Cat’s notes,” Lois continued. “But the more I connect the dots, the less anything beyond the stolen prototypes and the maintenance tunnel trace back to LexCorp. I think Lex the Second might have been telling us the truth.”

“It could be,” said Clark. “But if he’s anything like his father, we may not know for sure. Lex was always good at looking clean.”

“No, that goes under page three,” Lois said. “Sorry, it’s still a zoo here. I don’t know how Perry keeps this place running so smoothly. And there’s Dad calling. I’m gonna have to let you get back to work.”

The two said their goodbyes, and Clark dialed up Chloe.

“Chloe,” said Clark. “I need your help.”

“Of course,” Chloe answered. “What can I do for you?”

Clark stared at the computer screen. “Can you help me recover some deleted files?”
###Close Calls
---

**A.R.G.U.S. Base, Washington D.C.**

*Meanwhile*

---

“General Lane,  do you have a moment?” Lucy Lane asked her dad as she approached him in the hall. She didn’t notice the headset over in his left ear.

“Just a moment, Lieutenant,” Sam Lane told her, his finger in the air. “I’m on with your sister.”

Lucy stood at the ready while Sam finished his call.

“We have a lead on your mysterious robot designer,” Sam told Lois. “No name yet, but A.R.G.U.S.’ top researchers are on it. They should have something for you soon.”

“That’s great,” said Lois. “I owe you one.”

“Just doing my job, Lois.” Sam turned back to his other daughter. “I have Lucy here. Do you want to talk?”

“I’m swamped here,” said Lois. “Tell her I’ll text her later.”

Sam exhaled sharply. “Okay, I’ll–”

The windows crashed open, and several robots flew inside.

“Take cover!” Sam yelled as Lucy and everyone else in the vicinity ducked to the floor and around corners.

“Dad!” Lois yelled into his ear, but he didn’t respond.

Sam pulled out his firearm and shot off several rounds at the approaching attackers. But they just bounced off their metallic casings. One of them grabbed Sam by the chest while knocking the pistol out of his hand. The general struggled to get free, but the intense strength of the automaton was far too great.

A blast hit the robot, melting away part of its torso, and Sam fell to the ground, his headset dropping off his ear. Another few shots and it broke into pieces. Lucy came running, wielding a more advanced firearm, and took her father into the nearest office, the two ducking behind a metal desk.

Lois’ voice could still be heard yelling through the wireless headset in the hall.

“You should really arm yourself better,” Lucy told her dad.

Sam was a traditionalist. He preferred his old Beretta, but maybe she was right. More firepower was needed for the threats A.R.G.U.S. faced.

“May I?” he asked, his daughter handing her weapon right over.

Several robots fired blasts of their own toward the desk, which fortunately shielded the two from harm. But they could hear them moving closer.

Sam leaped up and fired off several shots, slowing them down. But one managed to reach the desk, tossing it to the side. The robot slapped the general across the face, knocking him unconscious. As it leaned down to pick up the general, Lucy tried to pull the robot off of him. But it would budge. Another robot grabbed her, and the two were dragged back into the hallway, where several other robots were trading blasts back and forth with other agents.

Lucy slipped out of the robot’s grip, but it managed to keep a hold on her ankle. As she was dragged across the floor, her eyes gleamed as she saw Sam’s headset.

“Lois!” she called into the receiver. “We’re being taken! Send Super–”

Another robot crushed the headset with its foot.

Sam and Lucy were flown out of the broken windows and off into the distance.

---

**Above the Chesapeake Bay**

*Minutes Later*

---

Clark flew toward D.C. as soon as Lois called him. He slowed his approach over the water when he spotted the two robots carrying Sam and Lucy.

“Stop!” Clark yelled, but the kidnapping machines kept their speed constant, swooshing past the Man of Steel. “Rude,” he stated before turning around and closing back in on them.

The robots continued forward, but switched to holding their prisoners with one hand each, allowing the others to take aim behind them and fire energy blasts.

Clark dove to avoid the shots and kept in close proximity. He wasn’t going to lose them. He increased his speed to close the gap and reached out his hands toward Lucy.

“Superman!” she yelled.

Maybe he could yank her free while he took out the one holding her.

The robot adjusted its path, moving in close formation with the other. They rotated to face each other, blocking their hostages from Clark’s reach. He continued to move in, but the robot shot off another blast, exploding in Clark’s face. The two circled around until the other robot was next to him, and it punched Clark far off into the distance.

He shook it off and shot off in a burst of speed to catch up again, arriving by the robot carrying the general.

“Don’t worry about me!” Sam yelled. “Save Lucy!”

“I’d like to save you both,” said Clark, preparing for his next strike.

The two robots veered away from each other again, and the farther one let go of Lucy, quickly turning around to fire away at Clark.

They were sacrificing one of their hostages to slow him down and let the other get away. Smart tactic, but if they thought he’d give up saving both, they didn’t know a thing about Superman.

“You can’t save everyone,” one of the robots whispered. But it was just their programmatic taunting.

Clark evaded the shots as he plunged down to intersect with Lucy’s descent. He fired off intense bursts of heat vision, demolishing the lone robot before he recaptured his sister-in-law, lifting her away in his hands just as she was about to hit the water.
 
“Thanks, Clark,” said Lucy, holding on tight. “There’s an exposed gyroscope under the other one’s left arm! If you take that out, it’ll destabilize its flight!”

Clark nodded and flew them back toward the remaining captor, but they had taken advantage of the distraction to get way ahead.

“Pour it on!” Lucy screamed. “I’ll be fine!”

Clark kicked up the speed, wind rushing past the two as they started to catch up. A targeted beam of heat vision hit the gyroscope, and the robot carrying Sam began to wobble.

“Nice hit!” Lucy cheered.

Sam took the opportunity to wrestle his way out of the robot’s grip, pulled out a knife from his belt, and thrust it into the damaged area under its arm. The robot was jolted and lost control, letting its hostage fall from its hands.

Clark flew down to catch his father-in-law, but the robot also delved down to intercept. The Man of Steel moved Lucy to one side and caught Sam with his other arm before tilting down so his feet were facing the oncoming threat. Before the robot could swerve, Clark kicked his feet through its metallic structure, breaking it into pieces.

“Are you okay?” Clark asked as he leveled off, slowing to a hover.

“Fine,” Sam answered, Lucy nodding in agreement. Sam took a moment and added, “Nice work, Superman.”

Clark’s phone rang before he could respond. “Would one of you mind tapping my belt?” he asked.

Lucy wiggled her hand around to press the button to answer the call.

“Clark!” Lois called from the other end. “Dad, Lucy, are they okay?”

“They’re fine, Ms. Lane,” said Clark, catching Sam’s attention. “I’m bringing them back to D.C. now.”

“Something doesn’t add up here,” said Lois. “Why go after them?”

“They’re Clark’s family, too,” he replied. “It still fits the pattern.”

“True,” said Lois. “But still, my instincts are telling me this is something different entirely.”

**Elsewhere**

---

The prisoners all held on to the loose bar, pulling it with all their might.

“We’ve been at this forever,” said Eddie, dropping down. “It’s no use.”

“He’s right,” said Perry, also letting go. “Maybe we need another break.”

Cat turned to Jimmy, who was still holding on with her. “You’re not giving up, too, are you?” Her face was stone cold with a slight smirk of encouragement.

Jimmy shook his head. “No way, Miss Grant,” he said.

“Please, call me Cat,” she stated before the two yanked the cage back and forth.

“It’s starting to give!” Jimmy cried.

Perry and Eddie jumped up as Cat and Jimmy pulled the bar out, falling back into them and colliding into a pile.

“We loosened it for you,” Perry huffed, working his way back up.

“Will any of us fit through?” Eddie asked, studying the larger, but still slim opening in the upper area of the cell.

“Jimmy, you’re the smallest,” said Cat. “Let me give you a boost.”

“Are you kidding me?” Jimmy asked. “You’re way smaller.”

Cat gazed at Jimmy up and down. “Fine,” she said. “Help me up.”

Jimmy and Perry put out their hands to help lift Cat up, and she squeezed between their newly formed gap, dropping down to the other side.

“He left the keys on the desk over there,” Eddie pointed out.

“Got it,” said Cat, rushing over. She picked up the keys as a robot stepped out of the shadows.

“Nice try,” the voice of their captor stated through a speaker as the robot grabbed hold of Cat. She struggled, but its grip was too tight.

The captor continued: “There is no escape.”

###Convergence

**Hob’s Bay Spirits, Suicide Slum**

---

Clark returned to the liquor store after dropping Sam and Lucy back at A.R.G.U.S.. The Man of Steel offered to get them some League shelter, but Sam assured him they’d ramp up security with extra firepower. “They wouldn’t be taken again,” were his exact words, and there was no hesitation in his voice.

He and Lucy were concerned about Lois and the kids’ safety, though, but Clark assured them they already had protection. 

Kara was in Metropolis, staying close to the Planet where Lois was working, Jon was in his after-school program, and where Lara was in daycare. Meanwhile, Ma and Pa had Linda on the farm.

Clark needed to get back to his investigation, though. He had helped Chloe gain access to the computer in the store, but he still needed to look around for any more clues before reporting the murder of its owner.

After a quick search, nothing else stood out. Clark exited the building and took out his phone to make a call to Metropolis P.D., but it began ringing before he had a chance.

“Lois,” said Clark upon answering. “There’s nothing else helpful here until Chloe can recover those video logs. Tell me *you* got something.”

“Not quite,” Lois answered. “But something’s been gnawing at me since they went after Dad and Lucy.”

“What is it?” Clark asked.

“Except for Eddie, everyone else was connected to The Scoop,” said Lois. “Cat and I were teenagers working for Perry. That was even when we first met Jimmy.” 

“*Hmm*,” said Clark. “It could be a coincidence. After all, Eddie didn’t move to Metroplis until a few years ago. He wouldn’t be connected at all.”

“I know,” said Lois. “Maybe I’m just too fixated on the past since Cat was taken. And since I’ve been reading her notes. But if The Scoop is linked at all, Perry’s son Richard could be next.”

Clark heard a familiar hum approaching. It was the sound of the robots flying.

“I’m going to have to call you back,” said Clark, hanging up as several robots swarmed around him.

Clark readied an attack, but hesitated. The robots had cameras built into their eyes. And the radio waves emanating from them could easily be streaming the feed.

What were they doing there? He was dressed as Clark Kent. Why go after Clark when there were still people close to him they could take?

They moved in closer, one of them grabbing Clark by the shoulder.

Lois was right. It wasn’t about Clark after all.

Lois was close to Jimmy, Cat, and Perry. And she frequented the Planet News Café as much as Clark. She and Eddie were as close as he and Clark. And going after her father and sister? And now her husband?

It was about Lois.

Clark considered his options. Maybe he could duck and evade the robots until he could change into Superman to fight back. Or, he could–

No, wait.

Why fight? They would take Clark right where he wanted to be. Wherever the others were being held.

Clark lifted his hands into the air. “Don’t hurt me,” he said. “I give up.”

**Daily Planet**

*Later*

---

Lois read through Cat’s notes again, hoping there was anything should could have missed, when her phone rang. It was her cousin.

“Chloe,” Lois answered. “Any progress with those video logs?”

“Yes,” Chloe answered. “I’ve been trying to contact Clark, but he’s not answering. Is he there?”

“No, he went back to the liquor store to search for more clues,” said Lois. “Maybe something else came up? You know how he is.”

“Yeah,” said Chloe. “But I’m surprised he didn’t answer anyway. He usually would for something this important.”

“What did you find?” Lois asked.

“The internal camera caught the murder of the store owner,” Chloe explained.

Lois’s ears perked up.

“The perp was masked, though,” said Chloe.

“Still,” said Lois. “Maybe we could identify him with other markers.”

“I’m sending it over to you now,” said Chloe. “Plus a shot I found of him from the external camera. Unmasked, but in the shadows, and with terrible video quality. I’m working to try and enhance it.”

Lois opened up the photos Chloe had sent to her phone. She was right, the man was barely visible in the grainy, dark photo. But a key feature stood out to her on the face. A long, bushy mustache.

Everything finally clicked. She knew exactly who was behind it all.

**Elsewhere**

The robots took Clark to the outskirts of Metropolis to a familiar storm drain. Of course, the old Cadmus headquarters from back when they were a secret organization.

Clark was escorted through the tunnels and into a hidden room where the others were held in their cell. A shiny metal bar stood out from the others. It seemed to be recently welded onto it.

“Kent!” Perry called upon his arrival.

“Clark, they got you, too?” asked Eddie.

Cat sighed at the sight of her recent interviewer. “Welcome to the club,” she stated dryly.

Jimmy met his friend's eyes and smiled. He knew what it meant for Clark Kent to be there. They were as good as saved.

A man walked in as the robots tossed Clark into the cell with the others.

“Yes, welcome indeed,” the man said.

Clark’s eyes widened. He knew him.

Dabney Donovan. Co-Founder of Cadmus. He was also the target of Lois’s first front-page article for the Daily Planet,  way back before he was even known to be associated with Cadmus.

“Donovan,” Perry called. “What is this, some kind of revenge?”

“Revenge?” Eddie asked. “What did I ever do? I don’t even know you!”

“You probably got his coffee order wrong sometime,” Jimmy joked, but nobody was in a laughing mood.

“Sure, revenge is nice,” said Dabney. “But there’s more to it than that. Much more.”

“Whatever it is, Superman will stop you!” Jimmy exclaimed.

“Don’t count on it,” said Dabney, pressing a button on his belt.

Two more robots walked into the room, much taller than the others, and with sleeker metallatic coverings. They began to glow a greenish hue.

Clark felt an intense pain radiate inside.

No, he couldn’t have.

“That’s right,” said Dabney. “My latest upgrades will stop the hero from interfering ever again.”

Kryptonite. Why did it always have to be kryptonite?

But the more the pregnancy progresses, the more I’m feeling stressed and overwhelmed by the weight of the responsibility and changes ahead. 

I’ve been saving for years to be able to afford daycare, and now I feel anxious at the thought of needing to use all of it up… what could be a home downpayment (I rent). And what if I run out? I had been telling myself I could use childcare from time to time for hobbies (I’m in a chorus group with weekly rehearsals in the evening) and social meetups, but now i see how with the cost of childcare ill probably never feel like it’s really “worth” the expense — not when I could be buying diapers or other essentials with that money. 

My parents live an ocean away and are… they mean well but aren’t necessarily very helpful unfortunately. And I thought I had friends locally but lately everyone including me has been so busy, it’s been tough to meetup with anyone even for just coffee. Someone who has told me they would give me hand me downs from their own baby boy (now 3) never followed up after I nudged her twice. I just feel like I don’t know if I can really count on anyone locally. What if it’s too much for me to handle? What if I get so tired in the early months that I can’t function and take care of my child or myself? What if my child doesn’t like me, or I don’t like my child? What if I just burnout or get so tired I become badly sick with no respite? What if my life and career are over? 

I feel like I’m about to try to go down a precipice, I don’t know if my belay rope will hold strong enough to catch me of if I fall. I’m so scared. ",9,1759363164.0,SingleMothersbyChoice,3,1.0,False

I made it through Covid, through the BLM protests, this clown fest of a political cycle and for the most part I’ve been more than content putting my head down, making our over priced candy milk drinks and wishing people a great day. 

But I can’t express how upset I was to hear someone in a fit of rage during our peak tell me to end my life over something as silly as a cup of coffee. 

For content: Our power had recently gone out and all our machines were in the process of rebooting. Our SM decided to walk outside and inform our customers in drive to just pull up to our window so we could assist them there and for the 3 cars in line that were affected nobody had much of any issue. All except the last one. 

I could tell she was going to be an issue the second she pulled up. Glaring at me like I was everything she hated to see. I asked how could I help her and she almost retracted in her seat, dumbfounded. 

“What do you mean? You took my order already! A Pecan Latte!”

🌱- “I’m sorry we haven’t taken any orders as our system was down. What can I get started for you?”

“You can’t be serious *Slams hands on steering wheel* Fuck this…kill yourself! *speeds off*”



It all happened so fast that I didn’t have a chance to react, get a picture of her car or license plate. Absolutely nothing. The partner standing beside me caught most of everything and was just as shocked.


I don’t know what I was supposed to do different. But with how hard I’ve been trying to push this stupid back to Starbucks program it hurt so fucking bad to have this happen. What’s the point of trying to connect with a community that doesn’t even see me as a part of it? 


I’ve had awful people say these things to me simply because I’m Hispanic in a White little town but for just a moment I felt the weight of the world lurch overtop of me and I wanted to break. 


The partners that witnessed what happened said I took it better than any of them would have but just because I was able to brush it off In the moment didn’t mean it didn’t follow me to my break, on my drive home, and even now a few days later. 


Is there anything I could have done to better protect myself as a partner? Do I have to reach out to our crumbling corporate for anything and report this? 


Call me what you’d like. But I can’t give service with a smile when those who are wishing to be served want me deported or dead.

I started the antibiotics and was doing all of the below while on them:

Diet

Mostly FODMAP

Oatmeal first thing in the morning (the only thing that made me feel great)

Avoided spicy, fried, and raw food as much as possible

I'm vegan so meat and dairy were already out of the picture

Pho felt very healing

Lots of electrolytes mixed in water throughout the day (I used Hydralyte)

No caffeine. No alcohol

Supplements

Regular probiotics

S. Boulardii

L-Glutamine in the mornings

DGL chewables (20 mins before meals)

Marshmallow root tea after every meal

Gravol and Pepto when I couldn't deal with the nausea and discomfort

---

After Treatment

I immediately stopped PPI (my doctor never asked me to continue). I started feeling great, went on vacation, and ate everything (avoided coffee and alcohol).

Two weeks later, I had coffee and my stomach started aching badly. I felt terrible and panicked, thinking it was something new or that H. Pylori had returned. I was taking Gravol and Pepto to calm it down.

I went to a different doctor, did all the blood work and an ultrasound, and everything came back negative. They put me on medication for IBS, which helped slightly. Still, I felt nauseous after every meal and bloated like crazy.

One day, I took a PPI and surprisingly felt better. I mentioned that to the doctor and he put me on 30 mg PPI for a month. I felt alright, but the pain would return as soon as I ate something inflammatory (fried food for me).

So, I went back to the diet I was on during H. Pylori.

---

What’s Been Helping

I started consukting a naturopath and they asked me to double the dose of probiotics and L-Glutamine

Started using a tincture called Canadian Bitters (30–60 mins before meals) — honestly a godsend

Drinking cabbage juice with a little salt on an empty stomach

Ginger aid, chamomile, and spearmint teas

Slippery elm powder mixed in water before bed

---

Where I’m At Now

I'm not 100% better yet, and I know if I drink coffee or eat something I shouldn't, it'll all come back. But at least it's manageable now, and I feel like I'm on my way to full recovery.

I even tried decaf coffee one day just to test lol and it still hurt my stomach.

---

Hope this helps someone who's going through it. I've been dealing with this for 3 months now. It's absolutely possible to feel normal again after this terrible sickness.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nashville SC vs. CF Montreal: A Tale of Two Canadas (Minus the Maple Syrup)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of Eastern Conference titans as Nashville SC (the “Music City Mad Hatters”) host CF Montreal (the “Bleeding Heart Beaurangers”) on October 4. Let’s parse the odds, invent some chaos, and crown a winner with the precision of a referee’s whistle.

---

### Parse the Odds: Nashville’s Edge, Montreal’s Desperation

The numbers scream **Nashville as favorites**, with implied probabilities hovering around **53-55%** to win (based on decimal odds of \~1.88). CF Montreal? They’re priced at **27-28%**, which is about the same chance as correctly guessing a stranger’s Spotify Wrapped in one try. The spread favors Nashville by a half-goal (-0.5), meaning they’re expected to win outright. Totals suggest an over/under of **2.5 to 3.0 goals**, with “Over” priced as the sharper bet—because if there’s one thing Nashville and Montreal know, it’s how to turn a game into a goal-fest.

Historically, Nashville has dominated Montreal in recent matchups, winning 4 of their last 5 encounters. Last season, the Beaurangers’ defense looked like a group of kindergarteners trying to build a sandcastle during a tsunami. Nashville’s attack, meanwhile, averages 2.1 goals per game—roughly the efficiency of a beehive on a coffee buzz.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Very Confused Goalie

Let’s spice up the pregame gossip:

* **Nashville’s star striker, Hany Mukhtar**, is playing like he’s been paid in cryptocurrency—unpredictable, fast, and occasionally misunderstood. He’s coming off a 3-goal explosion against Toronto, where he celebrated by attempting a backflip (and landed in the stands. Graceful?). The team’s midfield, led by **Cucho Hernández**, is clicking like a well-oiled jukebox.
* **CF Montreal**, meanwhile, is a hot mess. Their starting goalkeeper, **Maxime Crepeau**, is recovering from a “mysterious” injury sustained while attempting to parallel park his SUV in a tight Montreal alley. Rumor has it he’s been replaced by a former circus acrobat named \*\*Zac

The connection is so weak and small, people just love to hop on a bandwagon and because it’s the most visible show of support that’s what they held onto. How about people educate themselves on the actual companies that make a HUGE impact on the Israel economy and IDF instead of focusing on the smallest thing and scrutinizing people for not being able to give up coffee. It’s not about that, it’s that people boycotting Starbucks are the same ones wearing puma with fridges stocked with nestle products. 

Starbucks is not even on the official BDS boycott list. I’m not gonna try to educate people why people are boycotting them it’s simple to search but that’s the thing, not one person I’ve asked actually knows why there boycotting it. It has nothing to do with the genocide, it’s about the union and Shultz who I’m sure you could find a million more shareholders who support isreal of other companies but don’t get torn apart like him. 
It’s just a fad now. Why would I boycott them if I’m not making any effort to boycott the actual big companies who support isreal? Why focus on such a small part of it if I’m not paying any attention to what really matters or doing any of my actual own research? 

Anyone else agree or never stopped buying from there? Idk fight with me in the comments i guess

My Mitochondria Upregulation Combo (PQQ & CoQ10),"PQQ makes your body build new mitochondria. CoQ10 makes those mitochondria actually work properly. You need both.

# Always feel slow and tired?

Your mitochondria are what produce energy in your cells. All your energy.

Poor mitochondria function is why you feel like trash at 2pm. It's why your brain stops working after lunch. This is why you need three cups of coffee just to feel human.

You're literally running on degraded cellular infrastructure.

People will tell you it's stress, or you need more sleep, or you need to meditate or whatever. And yeah, those things matter. But your cells can't produce enough energy because your mitochondria are cooked.

# PQQ:

So PQQ - pyrroloquinoline quinone does something most supplements literally cannot do. It helps your body create brand new mitochondria.

PQQ activates this gene pathway called PGC-1α. This is basically the switch that tells your cells ""yo, we need more mitochondria in here."" And your body listens and starts building them.

* Multiple studies showing better cognitive function in middle-aged people
* It's an insanely efficient antioxidant - we're talking thousands of free radical conversions before it breaks down
* Neuroprotective effects - your brain functions better
* Actual documented increases in mitochondrial density

# CoQ10:

Building new mitochondria doesn't mean jack if they can't actually produce energy efficiently. That's where CoQ10 comes in.

CoQ10 is literally part of the mechanism that produces ATP inside your mitochondria. Without it, your mitochondria are just sitting there doing nothing useful.

Your body's natural CoQ10 production drops hard after 30.And if you're on statins? Those medications destroy your CoQ10 levels, which is exactly why people on statins feel exhausted all the time.

**What CoQ10 does:**

1. Powers the electron transport chain (the actual energy production process)
2. Protects your mitochondrial membranes from getting wrecked
3. Keeps your existing mitochondria healthy

So you can have all the mitochondria in the world, but without CoQ10, they're useless.

# Why You Need Both

This is where people get it twisted. They want to take one or the other to save money or because they think one is enough.

Taking PQQ without CoQ10 means you're building new mitochondria that can't function at full capacity. You're creating infrastructure you can't use.

Taking CoQ10 without PQQ means you're optimizing mitochondria that are still declining in number. You're polishing a shrinking fleet.

**Together** you're actually solving the problem. More mitochondria (PQQ) that work efficiently (CoQ10).

# How to Take This Stuff

**PQQ**: 10-20mg daily. Start with 10mg for a week, bump to 20mg if you want. Take it with breakfast or whenever you eat first.

**CoQ10**: 100-200mg daily if you're just trying to optimize. 200-300mg if you're over 40 or on statins.

Get ubiquinol if you're over 35. Yeah, it costs more. But your body absorbs it way better. Regular CoQ10 (ubiquinone) is fine when you're younger, but once you hit your mid-30s, ubiquinol is the move.

**CRITICAL PART PEOPLE ALWAYS MESS UP**: Both of these are fat-soluble. You HAVE to take them with food that has fat in it. Eggs, avocado, olive oil, whatever. If you take them on an empty stomach or with just a piece of toast, you're wasting your money. They won't absorb properly.

**Be clear about this**: This is NOT a stimulant. You won't ""feel"" it hit you. This is infrastructure building, not energy stimulation

**Quality actually matters here**: For PQQ, get BioPQQ™. That's the form they actually use in research. For CoQ10, Kaneka Q10 is the standard. Don't buy some random garbage on Amazon with fake reviews. You're literally ingesting this - stop being cheap with your health.

**This won't fix a trash lifestyle**: If you're sleeping 4 hours a night, eating McDonald's every day, and never moving, PQQ and CoQ10 will help but you're still going to feel bad. Fix the foundation first. This is optimization for people who already have the basics handled.

**You need patience**: This takes 30-90 days minimum. If you want energy right now, drink coffee. If you want to actually fix your cellular energy production, commit to the timeline and stop expecting instant results.

**One thing**: If you're on blood thinners, talk to your doctor about CoQ10. It can interact with that medication.",1,1759362606.0,A1HealthReviews,0,1.0,False

I told everyone I was going off-grid for a few days. Said I needed a reset. Time away from screens. “Mental health,” I think I called it. It sounded better than the truth.

The truth was, I was burned out. Pissed off. Couldn’t stand the sound of my own name in someone else’s mouth. The group chats. The “check-ins.” The relentless flood of fake concern. I didn’t want care. I wanted quiet.

So I packed up the truck, loaded Bear in the back, and drove east into the Appalachians. Four days. Just me, my dog, and the woods.

No calls. No kids. No messages. No work. No world.

Silence.

But that was the thing about silence. Eventually, it always broke.

I found a clearing I’d marked years ago—no signs, no service, nothing but moss and air and an ancient pine standing like a cracked totem.

Bear, my old retriever mix, never strayed far. He sniffed the perimeter once, then curled up near the fire. I watched the sky turn melt above the trees and let the quiet settle in my chest.

I figured I’d sleep like a stone.

But Bear didn’t.

That first night, I woke to him sitting upright, ears twitching.

I sat up too.

“Something out there?”

He stared upward at the starry sky, cut apart by waving branches.

I looked.

Three pale lights hovered over the ridge. Bright, steady, and far too still for planes.

For a second, I actually smiled. I remembered the Brown Mountain Lights. People swore they saw them dancing over the trees. Ghost lanterns, they said. Reflections. Static trapped in the air.

I'd spent the better part of my childhood out here and I’d never seen them before.

I realized my phone screen had lit up and the flashlight had turned on by itself.

Bear growled low in his throat.

The light flickered once—then went dark.

“My damn phones messing up,” I said, picking it up and turning on the flashlight to see if it worked.

No service, of course. No messages or calls.

It’d be a good weekend.

When I returned my attention to the sky, the lights were gone.

The second night, Bear wouldn’t eat. Wouldn’t even lie down. He kept pacing to the treeline and freezing like he was listening to something.

I sat by the fire, flipping through old photos on my phone. One of them was of Mom standing next to Bear, her hand on his scruff. I’d taken it the year before she died.

Fog had crept in, rolling low.

Then I saw it—something shifting behind the clouds. Massive. Slow.

A shadow painted against the bright clouds.

Bear let out a bark so sharp it snapped me out of my trance.

The shape was gone.

Bear didn’t stop pacing.

And that night, neither of us slept.

The third day was wrong. The air was stale. My food didn’t taste right. No flavor.

I made coffee and tried to act normal. It tasted metallic.

This was what I wanted.

Quiet.

There were no birds. No insects. Not even wind.

It felt like the whole forest was listening.

That evening, I saw a figure between the trees. Tall. Distorted. Shimmering like heat over pavement. The second I looked straight at it—gone.

But Bear barked once and took off.

I chased him up the ridge with the flashlight swinging wild in my hand.

He stopped just before the edge, staring up at the sky.

I followed his gaze.

And everything broke.

The sky tore open.

Light moved across it like veins of fire.

Then came the sound. It reverberated in my skull.

Voices. Crying. Screaming. Singing.

I don’t even remember running. Just white-knuckle panic and Bear’s tail in the dark.

We made it to the truck. Don’t ask me how.

The engine barely caught. I reversed so hard I lost one of my mirrors on a tree.

The lights were above. A sky twisting like someone’s crappy wallpaper. Just color moving around.

I kept driving.

Bear barked louder and louder.

Twenty minutes later, the phone lit up.

Reception.

Four bars.

Then everything exploded.

Missed calls. Messages. Voicemails. Dozens.

Dad: *How’s the trail?*

Dad: *You feed that dog?*

Anne: *Our son is going to get himself killed.*

Anne: *something is outside.*

I clicked off the messages and opened the voicemails. I played the first one. My sister’s voice.

*“Mason—where are you? Just—please—please call me—”*

Static\*.\*

I played the next, my brother.

*“Mason. Christ man. Get your kids out of Pittsburgh!”*

I nearly slipped off into a ditch. I cursed and jerked the wheel, righting the truck.

*“—Marie! Forget the cat! We have to go! Mari—”*

A crash cut him off, so loud that it fuzzed the audio.

The voicemail ended.

I fumbled with my phone clicking through voicemails.

Anne.

Nothing but sobbing. Broken only by violent coughs and a faint scream in the background.

Then, static.

I dialed Anne’s number as the trees thinned out. And then I saw it—Pittsburgh.

Or what was left of it.

At first, it looked normal. From a distance. Lights. Streets. A faint hum of motion.

But the lights above weren’t normal. They hung in the air, massive and pulsing.

And the people—They were rising.

Dozens of them at first. Then hundreds.

I blinked hard, convinced it was some optical illusion. A trick of distance. Maybe my brain shorting out from too little sleep.

But the shapes were human. Arms limp. Heads tilted slightly. Faces slack.

I gripped the steering wheel so hard my knuckles popped. “No,” I said out loud. “No, no, no—”

Bear whined in the backseat.

I couldn’t stop watching.

And then, they came apart.

Just a sudden collapse into dust.

Hundreds of bodies gone in an instant.

Turned to ash.

It poured.

The first flakes hit the windshield like hail.

Gray.

I turned on the wipers.

They dragged thick streaks across the glass. I could see bits of hair, fragments of cloth caught in the slush. Skin? Teeth?

My stomach turned. I gagged into the crook of my elbow and started rolling up my window.

Too late.

It rushed through.

The stuff clung to everything. My jacket. My hair. The dashboard. The vents started sucking it in, blowing it in my face like cremation on high.

I pawed at the controls, turning off the fan, trying not to scream.

I looked back at the skyline—what was left of it. The lights pulsed again, slow and sure.

And more people kept rising.

I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn’t blink.

The truck hit the ditch and everything spun.

I dangled by my seatbelt, groaning. Nothing really hurt. But everything ached.

Bear shifted around in the back while I reoriented myself.

My phone rang.

Anne.

I stared at her smiling face and answered.

It started with a scream.

Shrill and raw.

I flinched, holding the phone away from my face.

Bear panicked and scrambled against the upholstery, trying to bury his face beneath the seat.

Then came her voice.

Not shaken. Not panicked.

Soft. Sweet. Too sweet.

Like syrup dripping into my ear.

""Mason?”

“Anne, are you okay?”

“No, Mason. They got the house. The boys… they’re…”

“Anne. What happened?”

Coughing.

“Anne.”

“Mason. The boys are gone. They’re in the air. Everyone is in the air.”

I watched the sky.

Gray pouring down.

“It hurts so much.”

“God,” my voice broke on the word. “I’m coming, Anne. I’ll—”

“Naked…. naked I shall return.”

The line went dead.

The quiet returned.

The quiet I wanted so badly.

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. Also please make an effort when messaging me. Also I want someone who I am physically attracted to, if you can’t respect that, don’t message me",1,1759362504.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False
1nvogv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nvogv4/reception/,Reception,"It started with quiet.

I told everyone I was going off-grid for a few days. Said I needed a reset. Time away from screens. “Mental health,” I think I called it. It sounded better than the truth.

The truth was, I was burned out. Pissed off. Couldn’t stand the sound of my own name in someone else’s mouth. The group chats. The “check-ins.” The relentless flood of fake concern. I didn’t want care. I wanted quiet.

So I packed up the truck, loaded Bear in the back, and drove east into the Appalachians. Four days. Just me, my dog, and the woods.

No calls. No kids. No messages. No work. No world.

Silence.

But that was the thing about silence. Eventually, it always broke.

I found a clearing I’d marked years ago—no signs, no service, nothing but moss and air and an ancient pine standing like a cracked totem.

Bear, my old retriever mix, never strayed far. He sniffed the perimeter once, then curled up near the fire. I watched the sky turn melt above the trees and let the quiet settle in my chest.

I figured I’d sleep like a stone.

But Bear didn’t.

That first night, I woke to him sitting upright, ears twitching.

I sat up too.

“Something out there?”

He stared upward at the starry sky, cut apart by waving branches.

I looked.

Three pale lights hovered over the ridge. Bright, steady, and far too still for planes.

For a second, I actually smiled. I remembered the Brown Mountain Lights. People swore they saw them dancing over the trees. Ghost lanterns, they said. Reflections. Static trapped in the air.

I'd spent the better part of my childhood out here and I’d never seen them before.

I realized my phone screen had lit up and the flashlight had turned on by itself.

Bear growled low in his throat.

The light flickered once—then went dark.

“My damn phones messing up,” I said, picking it up and turning on the flashlight to see if it worked.

No service, of course. No messages or calls.

It’d be a good weekend.

When I returned my attention to the sky, the lights were gone.

The second night, Bear wouldn’t eat. Wouldn’t even lie down. He kept pacing to the treeline and freezing like he was listening to something.

I sat by the fire, flipping through old photos on my phone. One of them was of Mom standing next to Bear, her hand on his scruff. I’d taken it the year before she died.

Fog had crept in, rolling low.

Then I saw it—something shifting behind the clouds. Massive. Slow.

A shadow painted against the bright clouds.

Bear let out a bark so sharp it snapped me out of my trance.

The shape was gone.

Bear didn’t stop pacing.

And that night, neither of us slept.

The third day was wrong. The air was stale. My food didn’t taste right. No flavor.

I made coffee and tried to act normal. It tasted metallic.

This was what I wanted.

Quiet.

There were no birds. No insects. Not even wind.

It felt like the whole forest was listening.

We got a distiller from Amazon - The CO-Z 1.1 gallon and this pure water not only has changed our lives but also our cat Toki.  She drinks way more water than ever before.  We also replaced her plastic dish with stainless steel dish’s and she is one happy cat!  

Before this we used city water and after seeing what was left in our distiller we quickly ordered a water filter for our shower.  It’s unbelievable!  Fluoride and who know what other shit is in our water poisoning us can kill a cow I have heard.  I’ve have heard that farmers will not feed city water to their cows because of this very reason.  That’s hearsay, but I believe it’s true.  I also believe it is our water that is killing us in our pets and making us sick.  Maybe even keeping us stupid… This water has changed everything for the better health wise for all of us.  We trashed the plastics. No plastic coffee maker.  We use a French press with distilled water.  Our food is way better because my better half only cooks with distilled water.  This water goes through you like a vacuum cleaner. No junk food! Read the labels.  We got stainless 16 ounce bottles to carry our water. Our large glass container to sun charge our water, and we love it. Our plants love the water too. You have no idea until you experience this your cat will love you.! And best of all you don’t have to spend all that money on those bottles of water that leach plastic because they set them in the sun outside the store and who knows?  Stop drinking the plastics.  Your karma will go up because you’re making less trash and your health will improve drastically! Toki is happy healthy and looks way better these days. It works!  Rain water is distilled water.  Don’t let anyone tell you it lacks minerals or electrolytes.  They know nothing!  Try it and thank me later.

I’ll be walking past my favorite coffee shop, minding my own business, and suddenly there it is:
Pumpkin. Spice. Everything.

It’s not just lattes. It’s muffins, cold brews, candles, even protein powder. The whole world seems to tilt toward cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. And honestly? It smells like nostalgia and tastes like a warm hug.

But here’s the catch - I’ve been working on self-control and healthier habits. I don’t want my choices to get hijacked by seasonal marketing and limited-time menus. At the same time, willpower isn’t about total denial—it’s about balance. Saying “no” forever just makes me want it more. Saying “yes” too often turns it into a habit I don’t want.

So this year, I’m trying something new: treating pumpkin spice as a seasonal ritual, not a daily default. One or two intentional indulgences to mark the season, not a four-week sugar spiral.

Curious how others here handle it—do you rely on strict self-control? Do you build in small seasonal treats guilt-free? Or do you embrace the full pumpkin spice flood and figure discipline can wait until winter?",1,1759362077.0,pl3nish,0,1.0,False
1nvob9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nvob9x/i_hope_you_enjoy_your_coffee/,"I hope you enjoy your ""coffee""","I once had a co-worker who just wound me up.  They were just one of those people I could not get on with and they were very snidy and extremely annoying. They just had to comment on everything I did, usually a back handed compliment or passive aggressive tone. Wasn't just with me but quite a few others had the same treatment off them.

Anyway when I eventually handed my notice in, I hatched my plan for revenge. We worked long hours and everyone literally lived off coffee or energy drinks to keep us going through our 13 hour shifts.  
Achilles heel identified!

Their favourite coffee to have at work was a barista style coffee powder, like Nescafe Azera.
So, on my last day, I took with me to work a jar of Bisto Best beef instant gravy. It's texture and consistency is powdery and almost on par with the coffee.

I emptied out half the coffee into the bin and replaced it with the gravy powder. Giving it a good shake to distribute evenly. The end result was great. Couldn't notice any change in colour as the coffee powder kinda coated the gravy powder. The only difference was a hint of a beefy smell.

I said my goodbyes and left never to return. Now, obviously I wasn't there for the result but a colleague text me a few days later to let me know that she heard a loud shot of ""f@ck me, it's f@cking gravy"" from the staff room.

May not be the biggest win ever, but certainly felt like it at the time.

That was a little over 10 years ago and the satisfaction still randomly pops into my head every now and then to provide a lovely warm glow to my day.

Ashes of Equity  
Chapter 1  
The hilly countryside looked peaceful enough, despite the long stretches of barren cornfields and barns collapsing under their own weight. The pickup’s tires spat dust, forcing the men in back to bite their collars or press rags to their mouths as they neared the meet. Alligator cracking gave way to crushed stone as they turned up the drive. Cars had already begun to line the lot in a rough row—utility rigs, mud-caked pickups, a gleaming import, even a pair of ATVs. Ridge steered off-track, following the pale ruts in the grass that had carved themselves into permanence.

He killed the engine. Without a word, the three men in the bed hopped down. The shotgun door slammed shut, and Ridge gave the group a nod as they moved around the house toward the outbuilding beyond. He kicked the mud from his boots and stepped inside his home.

Even from the entryway, the rumble of voices filled the living room. As the door shut behind him, Ridge smirked—predictable as clockwork. Pavlov’s bell. Him, the reward.

“Ridgeway?” The voice had no softness in it, though he’d heard it a thousand times. The thud of footsteps closed the distance.

“Ah, Ridgeway, Ridgeway. How good to see you!” Calvin Jr.’s blazer was already dark with sweat. “The boys and I were reviewing some of the materi—oh, never mind that. You’re ready for tonight, aren’t you? Of course you are, indeed. But this one, Ridgeway, this one’s critical. It has to be a spectacle. It must. And so it will be. A show of force. Exciting, yes? Motivating, yes? The whole package, Ridgeway.”

“Not a big speech, Calvin. But always ready,” Ridge said evenly. He patted the damp shoulder of the blazer, guiding Calvin back toward the living room before breaking off into the kitchen.

“Anybody thirsty?” he called. Two hands went up. He grabbed four glasses and poured them full of Parity Farms bourbon. Not his first choice, but close enough. With a hand clamped around the rims, he carried the lot to the coffee table. Calvin Jr. snatched his first.

“Oh, what’s this, Ridgeway?” Calvin asked, swirling the glass with exaggerated grace, fat fingers pinching the delicate crystal.

“Drink up.” Ridge handed off the next pours to Bex and Avery.

Before he could set the last down, a stack of zoning maps slapped across his chest. Bex had leaned forward, glasses slipping, words tumbling faster than his breath.

“Look at this, Ridge—here. Heritage Zoning. They pass this, whole swaths of land flip overnight. Families forced to sell, some for pennies. It’s not just the cities—it’s here. The Clemensens and Byrnes. Here and here.” He jabbed the map again, red lines bleeding like wounds across the county.

Ridge steadied the papers with one hand, bourbon in the other, and studied him. Bex wasn’t wrong—hardly ever was. But where Bex saw a policy map catching fire, Calvin Jr. saw a match to wave. Ridge knew better than to let him anywhere near the strike strip.

“Two things a man should never be angry at, gents,” Ridge began.

Merrit clinked his thermos against Ridge’s glass. “Good coffee and beautiful women?”

“Ah—danger and play, of course,” Calvin said, lifting his glass and savoring the swirl more than Ridge’s words. He took a long sip, then added, almost as an afterthought, “Nietzsche said it well indeed.”

“‘What they can help, and what they cannot,’” Ridge corrected, tone dry as the bourbon in his hand. He studied Calvin’s face for a flicker of recognition, but found only the glaze of a man more absorbed in the taste of his drink than the weight of the idea.

“Plato—doesn’t matter.” He turned toward Bex. “This Heritage business is a fuckin’ sham, far as I’m concerned. We’ll take care of it. But the CLOs,” he shook his head and continued, “my place can’t be the only ground we stand on.”

Settled into law, the Cultural Licensing Ordinances clung to the Reparations Act like a second skin: no gathering, no business, no public venture without a sanctioned mix of faces on its masthead. But the scales were tilted by design. Black, Hispanic, and Native-led groups were granted exemptions; Asian outfits cleared with modest thresholds. White-led ventures bore the full weight. To its champions, the CLOs were the continuation of visible rectifications for centuries of imbalance. To Ridge, it was colder—and older. Bureaucracy in new skin, contradiction as correction. He’d seen the same machinery in the history books: every generation inventing rules to remind people who belonged and who did not.

“Careful, now. Talk like that might bring Peace Officers to the doorstep,” Merrit joked. “Red ink and paperwork—who’d have thought the day would come they’d be weaponized?” He smirked, sharp and charming.

“Now you’re speakin’ my language,” Bex replied, tugging the maps back from Ridge for safekeeping.

“All right, boys, we’ll talk more after. Can you see to the outside? Make sure everything’s still set, and get me the headcount. I’ll be on out in a minute,” Ridge asked of the whole crew. All agreed and headed for the back patio doors.

Only Calvin Jr. remained. He slung the full weight of his arm around Ridge’s shoulder, pulling him close like a parent drawing a child in to whisper a manipulative secret.

“I’ve invited somebody I’d like to introduce to you tonight, Ridgeway. He’s connected in a way I think’ll prove useful to our CLO conundrum,” he said with gleeful earnest.

The comment piqued Ridge’s interest, though he never liked expressions delivered with an air of complete certainty.

“Sure. It’ll have to be after, though. Meantime, ask Avery to make an introduction, will you?”

Calvin agreed and lumbered off, leaving Ridge to collect his thoughts in private. He moved down the hallway, past walls dressed in a quiet elegance few would expect from a man who carried himself the way Ridge did, until he found the desk in his office.

The mouse stirred beneath his hand. 5:12 p.m. His heart gave a jump; his mind sprinted a triathlon lap. He dug the phone from his pocket and dialed Antoine. The line caught—but Antoine didn’t.

“Tony?” Ridge asked.

The answer came in fragments: footsteps scattering across terrazzo, the groan of a heavy hinge, a door clapping shut.

“Hey, Ridge,” Antoine said, voice hushed. “Just a second.” More movement, then stillness. “Alright—you there?”

“Yeah, I’m here. Thanks. How’d it go, Tone?”

“Well,” Antoine exhaled, “eight bidders came through compliant, us included. Our number was strong—maybe too strong. Sharp enough to sting, but still in range. We checked every compliance box. But three other firms brought heavier Minority and even Veteran participation. With the new weighted bids…” The pause dragged, heavy as the numbers themselves. “We’ll have to wait and see.”

Ridge muffled a curse into his elbow, then let it fall away with a steady breath. “Alright. Nicely done, Tone.”

“Thank you. But we gotta’ talk about this, Ridge. We’re gettin’ pulverized out here—”

“I know, Tony. We’ll get together tomorrow. I’ve gotta run though. Thanks again.”

“Yeah alright. Talk tomorrow.” The line went dead.

Antoine lowered the phone, slid it into his pocket, and glanced through the glass walls of the conference room. Three or four contractors lingered inside, still buttering up the procurement lead. The new rules killed the game—no charm, no small talk, no gift of gab could outweigh compliance percentages now. A higher bidder could walk away with the job if his numbers ticked the right boxes.

Ridge turned back to his desk and woke the computer screen. A string of folders, a slow scroll, and then the document: Manufactured Division and the Two Sides Conscripted. He needed to hear the words again—the promise to himself. To remind himself of the world as it lived inside his own thoughts, in those rare moments of quiet reflection.

Still, a fear lingered. However carefully he crafted them, his words could be twisted—contorted in the mind of a reader, misused in the mouth of a follower. And somehow, despite all intent, he had amassed a kind of fandom. Increasingly, he noticed swaths of that base overlapped with the banners of political parties.

Ridge grabbed the cracked Brennan Brothers stress ball off the rough stack of invoices and gave it a hard toss against the wall. The cadence aligned with his thoughts:  
Snap out of it. Thud.  
Time to focus. Thud.

He turned back to the computer. The stress ball kept its rhythm with gravity, drumming against the floor while his eyes skimmed the document.

The first few paragraphs skimmed quickly, grazing like cattle across an open field, until one passage brightened against the white.

Nuance has not merely been neglected—it has been conscripted. What once gave thought its texture has been repurposed into a weapon: paraded by culture, enshrined by law, wielded as proof of virtue.

In our quarrels and our debates alike, resolution is no longer sought through understanding but manufactured through division. The ritual repeats itself endlessly: carve the field into sides, declare them opposed, call the fracture order. Politics only perfects the pattern.

But the pattern is older and deeper than politics. It is in us. We are trained—by habit, by culture, by law itself—to reduce the world to sides, as if all of existence could be decided by the toss of a coin.

Pause. Recall the greatest hours of your life: the birth of a child, the hand of a lover trembling in yours, the wild triumph of victory, the quiet mercy of forgiveness. In those moments—did you calculate the past to make the right move? Did you bargain with the future before acting? No. You were present. Whole. Entire. It is presence, not division, that renders memory sacred.

When nuance is cast as the enemy, presence becomes the casualty. A world split into sides has no space for the unmeasured instant, no patience for the uncalculated breath. And so we are robbed—not only of clarity, but of the very marrow of living. Division gives us the illusion of control, a false clarity to grasp.

We clutch it because it feels familiar—because comfort seduces us into mistaking repetition for safety. Yet comfort is not presence. Comfort calcifies, like the thickened skin beneath our feet. Presence lives, like the blood in our veins. From above, the suburbs appear as callus, the forests, mountains, and rivers, as lifelines. Growth is not found in retreat to what we already know, but in the courage to inhabit what is still wild.

Ridge closed the document, the glow of the screen burning against his eyes. The words hadn’t given him a plan—that was never their purpose. Out there, they wanted sides, slogans, something sharp to chant. But Ridge knew if he didn’t walk out with presence, with the marrow of what he’d written, the crowd would leave with fracture instead of fire.

A tidal wave of emotion rose and broke with each breath as he moved toward the rear entry. Light flared through the roll-up door in the distance, twilight swallowing the silhouettes of people eager to feel seen again. Ironic, Ridge thought—wanting visibility in a world that had no intention of seeing them whole. Humor, however predictable the punch line, remained the best medicine.

As was his custom, he skimmed Bex’s printed agenda in stride, shaping a plan to keep course despite already being behind. Half-greetings and intentional dodges tugged at his conscience, but everyone here had lives beyond this gathering. Himself included.

The house was packed, clusters forming under the invisible law of proximity, each circle buzzing with its own passion. Ridge caught Avery’s eyes across the room, gave him a nod, then bent to straighten a line of chairs toward the front—hoping the small busyness would keep others from pulling him in too soon.

“What’s white and red and not black at all?” Merrit quipped, his grin sharp as ever. Ridge chuckled, shaking his head as Merrit clapped him on the back.

“An opener for this crowd, bud,” Merrit said, laughing. “All told, we’ve got over forty heads today.”

Ridge scanned the room—faces flushed with drink, etched in discontent, and gnawed by the hunger for someone to tell them the fracture was real. That they weren’t crazy, that they weren’t alone.

In one of the larger clusters, a figure drew his eye, though it was clear the magnetism wasn’t his alone. Standing a full foot shorter than the men around her was Devi Spinelli. Olive-skinned, auburn-haired, and unflinching, she was the firebrand leader of W.A.G.E.—the Women’s Alliance for Gender Equality. Her relationship with Ridge was both strained and indispensable. Judging by the murmurs of those around her, she had found her footing here tonight, carrying a message of her own.

“Eyes over here, soldier,” Merrit’s voice cut through Ridge’s focus. He handed Ridge an empty beer bottle with a smirk. “Still my favorite starting signal.”

“Yeah, you’d think I’d have bought an air horn by now,” Ridge replied. He set the bottle down on a straightened chair, eyes flicking toward the push broom hanging neatly on the wall rack. There was something almost artful in the contrast—the working man’s tool, the ritual he knew by heart.

Merrit peeled away toward Avery. Ridge lingered a moment longer, scanning the room. Crash zone cleared and trajectory fixed, he scooped the bottle back up, leaned the broom in its place, and strode into the clearing.

The sharp crack shattered the room, drowning the conversations and snapping every head toward him.

Avery took the cue. “Alright, everybody, let’s get settled, please. Let’s get settled. We’ll begin in a few minutes.”

His voice carried weight, but his presence carried more. Long gray hair spilled from beneath a head bandana, his beard just as untamed. He walked the perimeter like gravity in denim, arms like barrels, a sleeveless vest long surrendered to his biceps. One by one, conversations broke, voices quieted, and chairs scraped in chorus as the barn shifted into order.

Ridge swept the glass into a neat pile in the corner while Calvin Jr. slid into the head table. Ridge’s chest tightened with bittersweet thumps as he crossed the floor to join him.

The setting carried its own accusation. Heads bobbing in rigid rows, metal chairs rocking with that cheap springiness he knew too well. Fluorescent lights caught the chrome arms, flashing until his eyes jerked upward to bulbs forever buzzing their swan song. And there at the front—a table perfectly centered. Not to serve the crowd, but to declare who mattered most.

Ridge had always defied this kind of order. It reeked of diplomacy: cages dressed as freedom, rituals of authority disguised as choice. A crutch people leaned on until they forgot how to walk without it. And because the crutch was painted to match the mirror, they mistook its weight for their own strength.

And yet—he loved them. Not a soul he’d met was hollow. They were good. Their latching was a reflex, not verdict. Without these structures, without the paradox of hating and needing them both, this gathering would dissolve into nothing.

Truth be told, the moment meant something to him too. Everyone, once, grows up believing they’re meant to be heard. Most outgrow the dream or bury it. And here he was—proof of it. The excerpt had reminded him: gratitude and resistance are not opposites. They’re unidentical twins. The paradox itself is the ground you stand on.

He lifted his eyes to the crowd. Calvin Jr.’s glance slid right off him. Ridge cleared his throat, smiled, and let the words finally come.

“They told you not to come,” he said, almost in amusement.  
“They told you not to be here,” the laughter gone. “That’s the truth.”

He leaned forward, fists tight against the table, fire in his eyes.  
“Funny thing about truth is—” his voice cut clean through the room.  
“It shows up anyway. Just like all of you.”

Behind the soft white vinyl of the idyllic Quaid-Ross household, Elise drifted beneath a lavender swell, buried in a mountain of toss pillows and plush toys with secret names.

Her body soared over green pastures on a quest—one that could not be completed without the heroic deeds and bravery of her companion, Scout, her childhood cat. Together they surveyed the fields below with urgent eyes, both holding dear the stakes at play.

Just as ease had struck enough to absorb the majestic landscape, a sighting: the Feline Legion, burgundy uniforms gleaming, black-painted armor catching the light as they marched across an open field. Elise knew it as well as Scout did. They had to act.

Flying came to her intuitively, though her nerves tangled as she led Scout in descent. The Legion grew closer, as did the ground. Her speed felt reckless, but she trusted her instincts. She prayed Scout could keep pace.

At thirty feet, the fear of a crash landing was so vivid she could almost remember it already. But it hadn’t. She touched down in a perfect landing, Scout standing tall at her side.

The leader advanced, an army at his back. He wielded a flail, a black cavalier hat shadowing his eyes. Elise felt a knot rise in her throat. He stopped five feet from where she and Scout stood.

And just as she opened her mouth—ready to murmur the words that might rewrite the history books and deliver this realm a peace treaty—the world went white. Slowly, inevitably.

She tossed beneath her sheets.

“Rise and shine, sweet angel.” It was her mom’s voice.

While unexposed to the piercing pains of alarm clocks, the function landed all the same. She knew it was time to get up. Behind the scenes, though, she recognized that the performance of rising was enough to fool the morning warden.

This was her favorite week for that purpose. Not only because she became the main character in the thriller films she knew by heart, but because Mrs. Chandra carried the torch for this week’s carpool sprint. Of the four-parent cycle she rotated through each quarter—her mother among them—Elise had discovered that Mrs. Chandra’s pickup gave her the most time in bed, since she was the last to be collected.

During her mother’s turn, however, there wasn’t even enough breathing room to end up with mismatched socks. Everything had to be laid out precisely the night before, or risk losing precious time in her secret wars and adventures with Scout.

It’s all in the voice, Elise’s inner dialogue reminded her. With a certainty that only the autodidacts ever bragged about, she said, “Yeah, Mom. I’m up, I’m up.”

“Good morning, sweetie. Be down in a bit, please. I’ll have breakfast ready.”

“Thanks, Mom. Be down in a minute,” Elise said with irrefutable innocence and gratitude. Even before the door closed, she celebrated her scheme in progress, pulling the comforter back over her eyes in sync with the latch.

Five more minutes, she declared. And just as prophesied, she leapt from beneath the ocean of bedding, out of her dreamscape, and strolled with calculated calm out the door, past the balusters, and into the bathroom to complete her routine.

A handwave at the side of the cabinet sink triggered a motion-sensor drawer. This drawer was hers and hers alone, and she had always loved that. She pulled a purple case from inside, popped the lid, and almost instinctually snatched the UV Retainer from its dock, opening her mouth for entry. The retainer hummed—ten seconds where her mouth wasn’t her own. The Thermostylist swept her hair into line. By the time both clicked home, the mirror showed Elise the way the morning liked her: neat, obedient, official.

On her way back to her room she scooped the neatly pressed uniform from the doorknob, shut the door behind her, and slid it on. She grabbed the folded corner of the bedsheet she had escaped from and pulled it in line with its opposite, leaving stuffed animals and cushions strewn in her wake, childhood surrendered the same.

Down the polished wood steps with a backpack slung over her shoulder, she entered the kitchen. A wholesome, toasty aroma circled the air. Waffles—again. Elise wrinkled her nose.

She reminded herself of the plan.

Ever since the first day she’d ridden with Mrs. Chandra, life had given her a small mercy: semolina pudding, bright with a fresh fruit topping, handed out in neat little containers. That fateful first ride, Elise had lit up without meaning to, and Mrs. Chandra—reading the delight—had made it a habit. It wasn’t just the taste, or even the novelty of something new. It was the container, the fact it was hers. She’d rinsed the first one in the school bathroom and used it to organize the pens in her locker. What would today’s become? She gazed somewhere a world away from waffles.

“Well, good morning, bug.” Her mom opened her arms for the ceremonial hug. Elise leaned in, then pulled back with practiced innocence.

“Waffles again, Mom?”

“Mhm. And fresh-squeezed orange juice at the table,” her mother said, setting agave beside the pitcher.

A platter of roasted vegetables joined the spread as Elise’s pack landed perfectly imperfect on the chair’s finial. She grimaced, then slipped into the reflex arc of her choreography: pile just enough on her plate to appear dutiful, break the waffle in half—easy enough with gluten-free texture—stage a convincing trail of bites, then quietly dispose of the rest. Her heroine duties hadn’t ended with the morning warden. They’d only just begun.

Her siblings, Amara and Michael, had already graduated from the carpool program. Elise could practically feel the victory of riding shotgun in Amara’s car, trading gloating glances while Michael sulked in the back.

But freshmen at this school didn’t get that choice. Not even the heirs of the influencer generation had found a way out.

The Reparations Act, for all its radiance, left an afterglow that didn’t sit still. Its light unwove into independent offspring. One such glimmer, born of emissions debates and climate mandates, scrapped buses and drafted families into carpools.

You know how I'm always fumbling with my phone, trying to stretch my thumb to the top corner and nearly dropping it on my face? I was on a crowded train the other day, desperately trying to tap the ""back"" button one-handed, and I had this vivid memory of my first little iPod Nano that just fit so perfectly in my palm. Everything felt more manageable then.



That whole struggle is exactly why I started looking into smaller phones, and it's what led me to pay attention to the rumors about the iPhone 17. The talk is that they're finally prioritizing a more compact, ergonomic design for one of the models. It's not just about a smaller screen, but a smarter layout that puts all the key controls within a natural thumb-sweep. It sounds like they're designing it for how we actually hold devices, not just making a spec sheet.



It reminds me of something I read about the ""Gulf of Execution"" in design—it's the gap between what you want to do and what the device lets you do. A good design bridges that gap. The idea of a phone that closes that gap, where you don't have to perform finger gymnastics just to hit ""send,"" feels like a return to sanity. My hand already feels less cramped just thinking about it.



If they pull it off, it would be such a relief. No more precarious balancing acts or two-handed typing when you're holding a coffee. It just seems like a thoughtful step back towards the human scale of technology.

In CINEMA SLASHER, the silver screen transforms into a blood-soaked nightmare as you’re pulled into horror film realms haunted by the Slasher’s rage. Each scene drags you deeper into cinematic terror, where every hallway is littered with decaying corpses and every shadow hides a blade.  
  
Will you escape the Slasher’s rampage, or become a permanent part of his cursed collection of victims? The sinister Midnight Theater beckons the brave and foolish alike to face their fears, survive the scenes, and escape before the credits roll.  
  
Part of the legendary Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 lineup, this haunted maze pushes the limits of fear with immersive sets, twisted storytelling, and pulse-pounding scares that you’ll never forget.  
  
Nightmares have been revealed, and the fog has settled on the 2025 Knott’s Scary Farm event with a chilling lineup of mazes, scare zones, and shows. This year brings two new haunted experiences: The Zoo, where abandoned animal enclosures have been transformed into a laboratory of horrifying animal-human experiments, and Mary — The Haunting of Worth Home, a terrifying journey through a haunted house with dark secrets lurking behind every mirror.

Popular returning mazes include Eight Fingers Nine: The Boogeyman, Widows, Room 13, Cinema Slasher, The Chilling Chambers, and Origins: The Curse of Calico. Fans will also encounter familiar frights in scare zones such as Ghost Town Streets, The Gore-ing 20’s, Carnevil, Forsaken Lake—complete with its haunting Funeral Procession—and The Gauntlet, which has returned with a fresh new twist.  
  
In addition to the mazes and scare zones, Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 features a variety of live shows and seasonal offerings. Guests can laugh and scream at The Hanging: There’s a New Tariff in Town, be mystified by Conjurers at the Bird Cage Theater, or be dazzled by dark carnival acts in Le Magnifique Carnaval du Grotesque on the Calico Mine Stage. Beyond the scares, fans can also explore Into the Fog: A Scary Farm Tribute Art Show, check out props and history in the Legacy Store and Museum, or enjoy seasonal overlays like the Halloween Hootenanny on Timber Mountain Log Ride. Special event extras include the return of No Boo Necklaces for those who want a scare-free experience, Haunt Lanterns with over 100 interactive activations throughout the park, and special appearances by The Boulet Brothers on select nights.  
  
Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 runs for 30 fright-filled nights from September 18 through November 1, with hours from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and until 1:00 a.m. on select Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.

With over 1,000 monsters roaming the fog, terrifyingly creative mazes, immersive scare zones, and a legacy spanning more than 50 years, Knott’s Scary Farm continues to reign as the largest and longest-running Halloween theme park event in Southern California. This year’s lineup proves once again why Knott’s remains a must-visit destination for horror fans and thrill seekers ready to face their darkest fears.

The problem: a few times now, I've thought I was just hanging as friends and suddenly I get the ""I'm not emotionally available / we didn't click romantically"" text.

1nvo0u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvo0u2/what_espresso_machine_is_best_for_travel/,What espresso machine is best for travel enthusiasts?,"Hey fellow coffee lovers! I've been traveling quite a bit lately, and as someone who can't start their day without a proper espresso, I wanted to share my experience finding the perfect portable espresso maker.

After trying several options over the past few years, I've finally found what I believe is the holy grail of travel espresso machines. But before I get into my top pick, let me tell you what I learned along the way.

First off, when looking for a travel-friendly espresso maker, you need to consider several factors:
- Size and weight
- Durability
- Ease of cleaning
- Pressure capability
- Power requirements
- Price point

I've experimented with manual devices, battery-operated ones, and even those tiny stovetop versions. While each has its merits, I kept running into issues. Either they were too fragile, couldn't produce enough pressure for real espresso, or were just plain inconvenient to use in hotel rooms.

That's when I discovered this amazing compact espresso machine (https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine). It's been a game-changer for my travel coffee routine. The build quality is exceptional, and it produces cafe-quality shots consistently.

What I particularly love about this machine is:
- It heats up in just 45 seconds
- Produces 19 bars of pressure (most cafes use 9)
- Fits easily in carry-on luggage
- Works with both grounds and pods
- Has a built-in milk frother

The best part? It doesn't require any special voltage adapters, making it perfect for international travel. I've used it everywhere from tiny Airbnbs in Italy to camping trips in Colorado.

For those interested in upping their travel coffee game, you can check out the detailed specs and current pricing here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

Some pro tips I've learned:
1. Always pack a small scale
2. Pre-heat the machine with a blank shot
3. Bring your favorite beans rather than relying on local options
4. Clean it after every use (seriously)
5. Consider getting a protective case

While there are cheaper options out there, I've found that investing in quality pays off in the long run. Nothing's worse than having your coffee maker fail in a foreign country!

The machine has already paid for itself considering how much I used to spend at cafes while traveling. Plus, there's something satisfying about pulling your own shots in the comfort of your hotel room or vacation rental.

Anyway I don't work there anymore as I have some personal physical health issues but I have a slight UPDATEEEEE

So A few weeks ago I was out with my Boyfriend ""DAMIEN"" (27M) getting dinner. AND GUESS WHO OUR WAITRESS WAS!!!!!!!!!!

It was none other then ""EMMA"" herself who I haven't seen since she put me in A&E 6 months ago. 

I would like to state that a report was made to the police and my knowledge of the matter is that she got a caution as it was apparently her first offence. (my opinion is the first offence where she was caught)

Anyway I basically ignored the fact that she was the waitress and me and my partner just ordered our food. Why would we want drama? 

The issue was that she recognised me and she asked for one of the other waitresses to take over for her. (fairs) but they were all swamped with there own tables (every table was reserved) 

Anyway the night went well until it came to the cheque. Don't worry she didn't overcharge. Altogether or payment came to just under £100 and that was correct from the prices on the menu. We don't necessarily have to tip as this is the UK and tips aren't completely needed for hospitality workers to live well. Although I always tip depending on the service. 

""EMMA"" was a good waitress I may not like her but I still tipped her 10% 

She of course was not happy at all that it was 10% and stared screaming at my boyfriend. ""DAMIEN"" sat there completely silent almost blank. She screamed at him horrible things like ""if you can't control your girl then you're both D\*CKS""  and calling me a ""pretentions dog"" remember this is a GROWN WOMAN! 32 years old and going mad at a 10% tip. 

I ordered another drink and I told a little porky I said to her that I will go to the bar get and pay for another drink then up the tip. 

When I came back to the table she was STILL having ago at my boyfriend what I heard her say was ""You really need to learn to respect the people that handle your food""

  
Anyway this is when it may seem I was overreacting (I drank the drink by the way) but I asked for extra ICE!

I ordered a water. and drank it leaving the ice I poured the ice down the back of her tucked shirt and she almost cartoon like - jumped out of her skin... 

I know it was mean but she got the Ice out quite quickly, I did not want to cause harm only teach her a lesson. I took the 10% tip back (we paid in cash) and left.. 

Anyway just a couple days ago I bumped into her again while food shopping, this time alone. She spotted me and came over to apologise I told her I accepted her apology and apologised for the Ice down her back. (Why would I not apologise) 

Anyway that seemed fine and I went to walk off to carry on with my day and she called out my name she then gave me some demon arse look and said ""You will always be that stupid bitch that got me fired"" this time I ignored her comments.. 

I guess the update part is 

1. She only got cautioned for the hot coffee incident 

2. She works in a even more high stress customer based job

and 

3. she still acts like a damn child!

Like today, I woke up absolutely exhausted, slept for 45 minutes with my alarm going off, had a half-caf coffee, felt hypomanic until 3PM, tried to meditate, and then I started falling asleep again. Then I usually even out by the evening. This is not unusual, something similar has happened several times now. When I nap it also seems to last over an hour when I normally wake up after around 30 minutes.

Has anyone else had this happen?? I hear people talking about fatigue every once in a while but nothing about energy swings like this.

I'm hoping the side effects fade after another week or two. Otherwise I might have to drop my dose. I took 1mg for a month in May (before feeling better, stopping LDN, overexerting myself a couple of months later, and having my symptoms come back... I think I'll take it longer this time haha) and I don't remember this happening, so maybe 1.5mg is just slightly too much for me and I should ask AgelessRX to put me on the 0.5mg titration plan instead.

It seems to be helping a ton with my long COVID, though! My symptoms seem pretty much gone, though I am also taking Xyzal two times per day and pacing myself pretty well (~5,000 steps per day and no other exercise).",1,1759361044.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

* **Easy commute to New Albany**
* Access to **grocery stores, good food spots, coffee shops**
* **Walkable or lively area** so I can go out for dinner or runs or walks in the evening
* Prefer something **modern / newer if possible**, I also dont mind greenary/nature vibe

My son is 22 months, he’s our only child so it’s been a bit of a learning curve. I think from around 16 months I’ve noticed things aren’t quite right. 


Things he can’t do/“concerns”:

- Can’t speak much and doesn’t imitate many words unless it’s ones he can already say (mama, dada, nana). He does babble and chat to himself quite a lot. 
- Doesn’t use the mama, dada etc for us. The words aren’t directed at anything or anyone
- Doesn’t point or follow me pointing to anything out of sight
- Walks on his tip toes maybe 3-4 times a day, not loads 
- Loves climbing and it’s become an obsession where we’ve had to get rid of the coffee table because he’d climb and stand on it
- Loves to spin things, this has been a major play focus for him since he was a lot younger. It has calmed down since he’s found other toys of interest but he does still spin everything.. turns cars upside down to spin, spinner toys, anything circular. 
- Will hand lead me to do things for him, he’ll push my hand to the general direction of what he wants and get frustrated when I’m not understanding. 
- He will always move my hand towards something he wants me to do, like play with a toy etc. But I’m now pushing back and asking him to do it instead and he’s getting better at it. 


Things he can do:

- Great eye contact
- Responds well to his name
- Great at picking up social cues like smiling, understanding when we’re sad, angry etc. 
- Can follow basic commands, “give me a kiss”, “close the door”, “Get your shoes/ball”
- Has his own way to do animal sounds, “mmmm” for moo and opens and closes his mouth for monkey noises 
- He can identify animals if I ask him to “find the giraffe/lion etc. he can go and grab the corresponding toy. 
- Isn’t sensitive to noise at all, in fact he loves running to anything loud 
- He can clap and uses it on command or in songs etc, he can wave goodbye (only learned it a month ago) and says “gunggg” instead of bye and then waves. 
- Waits for my reaction to anything new or things that he’s unsure of 
- Great with change in routine, we’ve taken him abroad multiple times with no issues. He just gets on with it. 
- Loves peekaboo, he can do it on command or he likes to come and put his hands on his eyes and wait for me to start. 
- Great with gestures in nursery rhymes, he can pick those up quite quick. 
- Good sleeper, 9-10 hours a night and a 1.5h nap.
- Generally a happy boy, loves to smile and run around 
- I’m currently teaching him to point to animals in a book, he’s slowlyyyy getting the hang of it.

There’s so much more but of course it’s impossible to write everything down, I’m in the uk so I contacted our health visitor a few months ago and she didn’t seem too worried about his speech. 

I’m thinking to contact her again and ask for a speech and language referral. But I think generally do these symptoms or behaviours seem familiar to anyone? I’m very aware that this could be an autism diagnosis, I don’t think it’s severe and could be mild but again I’m just unsure what to think. 

Has anyone else seen anything like this and had any diagnosis or a situation where it’s something else or nothing entirely? 

It would be great to hear some stories whilst I wait for more information from the services I’ve reached out to.

Background: I was part of a friend group composed of 4 girls -- myself (35F), Helena (33F), Sophie (31F), and Francis (33F). We had been good friends for a couple of years; we all work in the same industry, would get together on a weekly basis, and shared lots of laughter and wine. I loved having this group of friends, as it was drama-free and super supportive.

Over Christmas 2022, I got engaged to my long-term boyfriend! Yay! Unfortunately I had to keep the engagement a bit secretive, as our engagement also meant that I would have to move cities and change jobs. Since we were planning a long engagement and our wedding in summer 2024, I wanted to keep the news to myself until fall 2023. The industry in which I and these girlfriends work is TINY and very gossipy, and I didn't want the news to get back to my employer until I was ready. I also didn't want to ask my girlfriends to lie for me, so I decided just not to tell any of them for a couple of months. It sucked, as I wanted to share my good news, but I thought it was for the best.

Fast-forward to July 2023, and Helena gets us together one evening to announce her engagement to Ryan (33M)! We were SO EXCITED, so happy for her, and even more thrilled when she immediately asked us three to be her bridesmaids, along with 3 other of her childhood friends. We of course accepted and within a day, I had created a bridesmaid chat to brainstorm how we could support her etc. Personally, I was also feeling really bad/guilty about not having told them my engagement news, and knew that I had to tell them as soon as possible. 

I finally got the chance in early September 2023. The girls were of course also very happy, although I could tell (and totally understood) that they, to varying degrees, were taken aback that I had waited 9 months to tell them. Helena was clearly the most miffed -- she didn't say anything harsh, but her body language was OFF. I didn't ask them to be my bridesmaids as I have a big family, and already had too many sisters and cousins to include any friends. 

Following my announcement, Helena became slowly more distant -- it made sense, we were all busy, she was traveling a lot, etc, but I could feel that there was some tension. I invited her to get a drink one evening a few weeks later, to hash it out. I invited her to share her feelings, and she just said that she had been taken aback and a little upset that I hadn't told them earlier, but that she understood. I apologized, explained my reasoning again, and then we moved on to discussing our weddings, which were both planned for summer 2024 (more than two months apart, mine in early June, hers in late August). 

Helena then planned a bridesmaids weekend for all 6 of us in late October 2023, so that we could all meet each other. Francis unfortunately was traveling that weekend for a wedding and couldn't make it, and I had family arriving to visit on the Sunday, so had to leave a little early. But it was a great weekend, so much fun -- I made sure NOT to talk about my wedding planning and keep the focus on Helena. Coming out of the weekend, the third girl in our group (Sophie) was put into a group chat with two of the other bridesmaids. I thought that was strange, but she explained that she was ""representing"" the three of us for the early stages of planning, so that the group didn't get too messy. Okay... Weird. I tried not to read too much into it.

Something to note here, Sophie actually started working at the same company as me during this whole thing, so from this point onward, she and I are working together every day, literally sharing a desk in a small office. We talked a lot. 

Over the next months, through the winter, I was growing more and more confused. Helena was still extremely distant, never having time to see us/me, and Sophie was sharing little tidbits from the bridesmaids group chat about planning the bachelorette etc. In fact, I asked Sophie straight-up numerous times if she thought I was no longer a bridesmaid? Every time she replied that she hadn't heard anything, that Helena hadn't said anything to her, etc. It was very confusing but I tried to brush it off.

Things finally came to a head at a party in March 2024. All four of us were there, and I finally had a chance to catch up with Helena. As we're talking, she said something to the effect of ""oh and the bridesmaids will stay on-site at the wedding property."" to which I replied, ""oh, great, do you think there will be space for my husband as well?"" She looks me dead in the eyes and says

""Oh, sorry... I thought you had understood. You're no longer a bridesmaid.""

In my head I am thinking, ""HOW WOULD I HAVE UNDERSTOOD???????? YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING???""

But out loud I just say, ""Oh, no, I wasn't aware, that's really too bad. But it's your wedding, and I'll just be so happy to be there and celebrate you guys."" \[I really said this, clearly I have no spine.\]

She then goes on to explain that since her fiancé is only having 4 groomsmen, she wants to make numbers even and only have 4 bridesmaids -- her 3 childhood friends and Sophie, from our friend group. So that means Francis and I are OUT, because ""well, you're going to be soooo busy planning your wedding, and Francis is pregnant \[she had just told us a month previously\] so I'm sure she will be too busy as well.""

I was SHOOK. I almost cried. I felt like I had just been rejected from the cool girls' table in the middle school lunchroom. It was awful. I left the party early and had a good cry in bed.

The next day, I text Francis, asking if she's heard anything. She's like, ""THANK GOD you texted me, I learned the same thing last night but from Sophie! She made an off-handed comment about the bridesmaids that made it very clear to me that I was not longer one. I don't understand, literally a few weeks ago Helena and I were discussing bridesmaids colors??? She hasn't said ANYTHING to me, this is so awful."" Francis then texts Helena to confirm this, and Helena replies with the same flippant, oh sorry, thought you knew. No apology, no real explanation. 

I was so upset, as I think you all can understand. I tried in vain to pin down Helena for lunch or dinner, just so that we could discuss. I didn't even want to like, yell at her -- I just wanted to understand wtf had happened. After several cancellations etc on her part, I finally got her to have coffee with me. During this coffee, I apologized again about not telling her about my engagement earlier, and asked if everything was alright between us. She once again confirmed that she was over any negative feelings she had about that, and that us being unbridesmaided was just a logistical decision. She also apologized for not being more clear. I left that coffee feeling better and remembering how much I liked her as a friend, but still unsettled. 

As for Sophie, the next day at work I pulled her aside and was frank with her-- I told her that I knew she was a bridesmaid and not us, and that she had essentially been lying to me for months. I told her how embarrassed and upset that made me. She of course had all sorts of excuses (""it wasn't my news to share"" etc) but it was all kind of BS. But we made nice and she apologized, and we moved on. I decided that as a mature adult, I could choose not to let this whole thing upset me, distance myself from the negativity, and just try to focus on my own wedding and coming to peace with the situation.

And I honestly thought that I was over it, until Helena's wedding in August 2024. Mine had gone off without a hitch a few months previously -- the three girls had come and all was lovely etc. But sitting in the church for Helena's wedding, I started noticing a few things.

1. She indeed had 4 bridesmaids, but also had a number of other girls (cousins, wives of the groomsmen) involved in the wedding in other ways -- they were in the wedding procession, did readings, were ushers etc. Francis and I were not involved AT ALL. 

2. Her husband had FIVE GROOMSMEN. So her story about wanting to match numbers was absolute and total crap.

3. Once we moved to dinner, which was seated, there came the final nail in the coffin for me. Francis and I were sat at a table at the ASS-BACK OF THE ROOM, Y'ALL. Not even the ass-back of the main room, no no, we were at the ass-back of the tent that had been added for overflow. We may as well have been in Timbuktu for all that we were considered at this dinner. Normally I don't care about wedding seating, but personally, if I was tragically forced to unbridesmaid two of my close friends, I would do everything in my power to make them feel loved and included on the day. Clearly, Helena either did not think about us at all, or (more likely) thought about us and then decided she didn't give a shit. Throughout the dinner, I just kept saying to myself, ""I was supposed to be a BRIDESMAID??????????"" It was surreal.

But in order to keep things civil, Francis and I smiled and chatted with everyone, tried to have a good time and danced all night. The next day I sent a thank you text to Helena, to which she replied politely, and since then I have not heard a PEEP from her -- helped/not helped by me now living several thousand miles away. Frankly it was a very sad and disappointing end to a wonderful friendship. I am mostly just so confused about what happened, why she became so distant (was it my ""secret"" engagement????), and why a grown-ass woman is incapable of OPENING HER MOUTH AND COMMUNICATING.

Thank you for sticking with this little rant -- it was extremely cathartic to write. ",6,1759360469.0,weddingdrama,18,0.75,False

1nvnpjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1nvnpjs/am_i_in_love_maybe_infatuation_i_dont_know/,Am I in love..? maybe infatuation!! I don’t know,"I generally go to my client’s office, but few weeks back there was this anniversary event happening at my payroll office , so I thought I’d go there after almost 2 months. Some freshers were performing dances. I was on my phone, checking Teams messages and pretending to be busy—typical me, haha.
And then this song Kannum Kannum Nokia (Naaku Neeku Nokia)—one of my favourites—starts playing. A girl comes on stage and starts dancing in such a cool way. She was beautiful. I was awestruck. I didn’t even blink.. To describe about her I might take another para but trying to keep it small(na kallato chudu mawa feels)..I just stuck my gaze on her. That was it—felt like a new crush had been unlocked.
The next week, I went to the office again, hoping to see her. I sat at some random desk, and someone’s bag was already on the desk in front of me. I set up my laptop and started looking around for her but didn’t see her. Then she entered… and walked right up to the desk in front of me and sat down. I was like, damnnn, this just made my day.
After some time, I started a conversation by complimenting her dance and we ended up chatting a bit more.
Usually, I have to follow a hybrid system at my client’s office, and the rest of the days I work from home. No one really cares if I go to my payroll company, so I usually don’t. But now, just to see her, I’m trying to manage to go there on whatever day is possible.
There’s this annoying policy my company has where freshers aren’t allowed to work from home for their first year. I used to hate this policy when I was a fresher… but now I kinda like it 😅 because it means she’ll always be there when I go, hehe.
Today was a super busy day—some outside work and I had to pack to go home for a long weekend. But I felt like seeing her, and somehow I managed to squeeze in a little time and went to the office.
The moment I saw her, everything felt different. My stress just melted away when I saw her smile. She has such a beautiful smile and always carries this positive, happy vibe. My heart starts racing like crazy whenever she laughs. She laughs in funny way which always cracks me up. I don’t know if she observed but whenever she laughs I don’t even lift my head but a small smile comes up on my face involuntarily.
The thing is—I had a girlfriend in college, and I remember how those initial butterflies felt. Later on, I did talk to others, maybe a bit of flirting here and there, but I never had the same feeling.
With this girl, I thought it would just be casual flirtation or a normal infatuation. But I’m starting to realize that I have feelings beyond that and can’t call it now for sure. It’s kinda crushing me. We sit in the same area—ours is a small office—and I can literally just watch her for hours.
Today, when she got up and walked out, I was just staring at her, completely zoned out. A minute later, I realized my other colleagues were watching me. I pretended not to care and locked my eyes on my laptop. There’ve been a lot of such moments lately.
She seems like a genuinely good person (from what I’ve heard and from the little we’ve talked), and she’s full of positive energy.
I’m literally waiting for the next time I can go to the office—just to see her.
But with all this… I know where this could go, and I’m scared.
Should I make the effort and try to get closer? Or should I stop this at the early stage itself?
Today, I tried to casually ask her for coffee, but she said she had some work. It was a normal response, nothing weird. Usually, I wouldn’t care much, but I was really rooting for her to say yes… and I felt a bit sad when she didn’t. I know girls take time, and I guess we’ve talked 3–4 times now, which feels like a good enough stage to ask someone out for coffee.
I don’t want to end up in a one-sided, hopeless love story. And because of that fear, I’m thinking of pulling back and not going to the office for a while—hoping I’ll slowly forget her.
But my heart keeps pulling me toward her.
I don’t know what to do. Just felt like sharing. If you have any advice or perspective, will be waiting in comments🫠",4,1759360462.0,hyderabad,0,0.84,False

Recently, I've started adding milk, but since French press coffee isn't as intense as espresso, too much milk easily ruins the drink.

Now I'm considering a moka pot. I'm torn between a 2-cup and a 3-cup model. I saw a video where someone said the 2-cup produces a taste and intensity close to espresso, but most people say the 2-cup is too small to start with and that the 3-cup is more practical.

Also, I can't decide between aluminum and stainless steel. Health concerns aren't an issue for me with aluminum, so my main priority is getting bold and intense coffee


TL;DR:

French press drinker for 2+ years, now want a moka pot for stronger, milk-friendly coffee. Should I get a 2-cup (espresso-like but small) or a 3-cup (more versatile)? And is aluminum or stainless steel better if I just want bold/ intense coffee?",1,1759360407.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Originally posted 9/18.  
Hi Everyone. I’m excited about this update because things have been going very well with table production and the first non-beta shipments will be starting soon. Let’s jump right into it.

https://preview.redd.it/klvdh3y81lsf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=174515bbb7ae837276b520cb17a6cb46f0e007f3

In the last update we talked about our main focus being scaling production capacity to deliver the almost 4000 tables we need to ship. I’m happy to report the scaling process has gone well. We’ve already started mass production of the mechanical gantries that go inside the tables. 

There are nearly 200 unique parts that go into each table, and we’ve already received almost all of what’s needed to fulfill all of the Kickstarter orders. We’re building sub-assemblies like the wooden shells and metal base plates, and the next batch of complete units are being assembled this week.

Production capacity has scaled significantly. The effort we put into finding the right wood shell supplier means that we’re now able to receive almost 1000 wooden shells per week. As the title suggests, we’re now full steam ahead with table production.

# What’s Next? 

We are on track with the timeline presented in the next update. Right now we are producing a small batch of 20 Coffee Tables that we’re going to send to a new round of testers. We’ll ship these to the US via air freight so that we can get some additional testing mileage on the Coffee Tables. The testers will be notified by email.

By the end of this month, we’re going to ship out our first ocean freight container of Coffee Tables. They should arrive in the US and start shipping to backers by the end of October. From there we’ll have a steady stream of shipments that continue into November.

Side Table shipments will also start in November, and we’re pushing to have those wrapped up before the end of the year. We need a bit more time to get a finalized timeline, but given how significantly we’ve scaled our production capacity we’re optimistic we’ll get everything shipped out before the end of the year.

In the next update we’ll talk more about backerkit surveys and what’s needed to ship out your tables. In short, all we’ll need is an updated address and a final selection for whether you’d like the dark or light finish. We’ll cover that in more depth next time, and nothing is needed for now.

As always our small but mighty support team is the best point of contact for any order related questions. You can get in touch with them by emailing [support@grounded.so](mailto:support@grounded.so)",1,1759360310.0,groundedlabs,0,1.0,False

   My husband (Leo) and I have been besties with this couple (Howard and Bernadette) since 2019. Leo an electrician and Howard a builder met through work. I noticed my husband had a new work buddy as every night he’d be chatting on the phone with him for at least an hour.
   
A month later we were invited to Howards destination wedding. We had not hung out as couples before then, so I reluctantly agreed. But since then we all started to hangout, as couples and as just the girls or just the guys. They became honorary auntie and uncle to our kids. We’d see each other at least 4x a week. Bernadette and Howard became our best friends through countless dinners out and cooking in, winter trips in the mountains, shared vacations at the beach, and the everyday monotony of our lives. She’s 10years younger than us (Leo & I), 13 years between her and Howard. 
    
Jump to 2022 Howard and Bernadette start building a vacation home in the Caribbean. They start traveling to and from the island more frequently. Howard starts drinking to belligerence and would put them in bad situations. I would get calls from a frantic crying Bernadette. Some examples she’s told me over the next year: 1. flight was cancelled so they went to the gate agent. He then yelled at the gate agent swore and called her names. She told him he wouldn’t be allowed on the next flight if he didn’t sober up by the time boarding started. 2. While traveling he left her at the hotel lobby saying he was going to off himself. She felt he was in danger to himself so she spent the night looking for him on the streets and in water. At one point she found a cop and he helped her look and thought they saw a body in the water, it wasn’t. But for that second it broke her. He eventually came back to the hotel at like 3am walked up to her and in her face called her a “stupid bitch”. 3. They were walking on the side of the road and he pushed her into the road. 4. He punched her in the face while she was driving. 5.Many arguments and him publicly yelling at her. 
      
When we hung out with them he didn’t act like she described. Sometimes the mask would slip and he’d say something demeaning to her. But I always quipped back light heartedly to defuse anything at the moment and changed the subject. Every time she’d call to tell me one of these things I would tell her you’re in an abusive relationship. If it were me I would leave and offered her a place to stay and any help. 
    
Leo would get the other side of the story from Howard. It was always someone else’s fault, Bernadette was wasting money, it never happened or he doesn’t remember. Leo has always been really good at compartmentalization. He thought they’re just fighting because building a house is stressful. When they finish the build everything will go back to the honeymoon phase. Leo also thought Bernadette was being dramatic and maybe even lying because when they’re with us he doesn’t act like that. They hold each other’s hand and she seems happy. (We live modestly, pretty much hang with our kids, work to take family vacations twice a year) When those things happened they were out drinking with people who live in luxury and are on vacation periodically 6 months out of the year.
    
When 2024 rolls around the house is still being built. We are all visiting the island for a family thanksgiving. Leo’s parents, all his siblings and their significant others, our family, B&H and another honorary uncle and auntie. There were a few awkward moments when Howard put Bernadette down in front of everyone. 3 days before leaving we all decide to take the boat to the cliff jump. All the adults ended up jumping but Bernadette. She was the last to go and it took her about 45mins to convince herself to do it. We cheered her on and tried to ease her nerves by telling her it’s not that bad. Some of us were swimming/snorkeling below in the water and some chillin on the cliff, no one minded waiting because we were in paradise and being there was enough. Everyone except Howard he yelled “you’re not gonna do it!” “ you’re wasting everyone’s time!” “What’s taking so long!” “Come on, get down””omg how embarrassing just walk down “. For the whole 45 mins. Then she jumped.  
    
When we got back to our rental she told me she was done and she was going to take the flight home with us. (They were supposed to be there for 3 weeks she made it to 9 days). Later that night at family dinner Howard was yelling at Bernadette and calling her names. He wouldn’t stop. I told him to stop. And at this point I’m annoyed my husband has not stepped in. Howard loudly tells me “You don’t understand!” And I said “damn right I don’t bc Leo would never speak to me” like he is to Bernadette (other side of the coin he won’t speak up for me either)Howard stomps off outside. The next day we have an all day tour planned. B&H are acting like nothing happened and they’re still in love. But I notice Bernadette buying merch at every stop we go to on their card like she’s never coming back. 
     
When we get home from that vacation Bernadette called me that weekend and asked me to help move her things out. So I spent the day with her doing that and talking. I felt she was making the right decision and was relieved I didn’t have to worry about something happening to her by him or because of a situation he put them in. That night she filed for divorce while Howard was still on the island. 
   
A lot happened between then to 2025. Some things: Howard accused Leo of having an affair with Bernadette and told other people that. I was so annoyed bc if Leo and I were different people it could have imploded our family with children.  I said what a shit friend to think that of you and then try to start that rumor. But Leo said he’s just drunk and going through it so we shouldn’t hold it against him. 

They both got jealous if we hung out with either. Bernadette wanted to continue double dating with them. I would try to make plans just her and I but she would change our plans to include Howard or completely ditch me to be with him.  
    
Then Bernadette accused us of trying to steal property/house from her. (When they were still good we had talked about buying this specific vacation home together. When things got messy we said let’s put it on the back burner until you guys finalize everything). So it was untrue but she called us assholes and ripped into us. I told her the truth and I didn’t appreciate how she handled that and we didn’t want to be in the middle of their divorce. Her and I stopped talking after that for 5 months while they finalized their divorce.  Leo and Howard remained the same, I didn’t hang out with them either unless our kids were involved. But during those times I’d hear about the divorce and it sounded like she got half of everything and he bought her out of the build.
     
Jump to current day. July their divorce is finalized.  August our immediate family is back on the island and Howard is letting us stay at the house he rents all year so he can be close to his build. He is not on island he is back in our hometown. Howard let us know Bernadette didn’t want us there and he had to do a lot taking up for us to make it happen. I talked to Leo about it and told him we should just find another place bc I see this becoming a problem. But Leo said it would be fine let him save some money when he can)    While there it was our anniversary and that day Leo was showing me a picture of the build and I swiped to see more and there was a nude photo of some women. Leo quickly swiped back and said “ you don’t want to see that” but I made him show me and he explained Howard sent that of a girl he’s talking to with the caption “this is what I’m working with”. I was pissed and it ruined our anniversary and the rest of our time there. i asked Leo why he didn’t tell me and instead I find out like this. He said he didn’t want to show me a nude on our anniversary because he sent it at 3am probably wasted. He feels he has done nothing wrong, it’s just a shitty situation and that I’m overreacting. I feel lied to and grossed out and like they objectify women. When B&H were still married and together she saw the group chat where Howard asked to be hooked up with the school nurse. 
     
Beginning of September Bernadette reaches out and we get coffee and talk about everything. She has a new boyfriend and is showing off their new love on social media. I’m happy for her and tell her I just want her to be happy. She misses the kids and hanging out. So I told her my son is doing football and had games every Sunday. She left for a couple weeks to travel with the her boyfriend. During that time Leo and I were kidless one night but he had to pick up Howard at the airport and invited me along so we could get dinner after. 
     
Howard has found god and gave me a little Jesus figurine. I’m happy for him until I find out that just means eveything that he has done is excusable bc god let it happen. He doesn’t have to take accountability because: God. Talk about someone with lack of discernment. I tried to have a conversation and say no I think you’re supposed to find the lessons in life and if god is calling you should read the Bible to find those lessons or join a group. But he talked over me. Leo gave me a look like I was being pestering. I let Howard know Bernadette and I were friends again and he told me she trashed talked me so much and doesn’t care about me or our kids. He said it in the harshest way possible. Leo just sat there. And I said I do have concerns but why would she waste her time and reach out and that I was going to see where it went.
     
It’s  the end of September Bernadette reaches out about my son’s football game and she’d like to go. We make plans. That Saturday morning Leo drives Howard to the airport to go back to the island. When Howard got to his rental he said things at the rental was different and dirty. He told us Bernadette told him we had left the rental a mess. ( I don’t know if she did say that, I should ask her) Luckily I had taken photos of how we left everything, because I knew this could happen. We didn’t hear anything again after I sent the photos.
    
 Howard’s known since the plans were made that Bernadette was going to the game. 
We have a good Sunday Funday at the game and went out to lunch after. I posted on my insta/fb story, pics at the game and Bernadette was in 1 of them. Monday night Howard sent Leo and I a group chat telling us we’re terrible friends and he’s so hurt we would be friends with Bernadette. And the nicest thing another couple did was cut off their friendship with Bernadette for him. (The other couple met them on the island they aren’t every day friends it’s easy for them to say that) First I called Leo and he said he was working and didn’t have time to read the text yet. I waited but I was heated and Leo never got back to me so I sent a text reaming him out. I’ll attach his text and my response. I have since blocked him and have him restricted him on my social media.  
   
But here’s my problem Leo thinks I’m causing problems and exasperating the situation. I tell him he never sticks up for me and just lets this asshole say whatever he wants and dictate who people can be friends with. I’m mad because Leo always sticks up for Howard and never tells him he’s wrong even when he thinks it. Leo lets Howard cause friction between us and blames me for overreacting. I’ve become resentful of Leo and I don’t want to be intimate with someone who has no backbone and doesn’t make me feel seen in our own relationship. I always stick up for him and help solve his issues but he rarely ever shows me the same respect. Im starting to see them as the same kind of person because my husband goes along. How do I get it through to Leo I don’t want to be friends or around Howard he disgusts me and I don’t want my kids around someone so toxic. I’ll try to attach the last convo.

1nvnena,https://www.reddit.com/r/wenclair/comments/1nvnena/wenclair_vs_wyler_romantic_narrative_vs/,Wenclair vs Wyler - Romantic Narrative vs Stereotypical Production Narrative,"Reposting somewhat of an essay I wrote last night (now with edits) because I’d love more conversation on this topic. Wyler fans, please feel free to comment - I enjoy discussion. My goal isn’t to start a shipping war, but to take a step back and look at how the show’s narrative framing treats Wenclair vs Wyler.

Despite the fact that I don’t see much evidence in interviews that Wenclair will become canon (whether that’s unintentional coding or intentional baiting), the show (aided heavily by Jenna Ortega and Emma Myers’ chemistry) has already written what amounts to a well-constructed, healthy sapphic romance. Narratively, Wenclair reads as the more romantic option, while Wyler follows a stereotypical production-driven trope that relies too much on subtext and familiar beats to feel fresh.

Before I go further: I don’t dislike Tyler, and I wouldn’t be devastated if Wyler happens. But if it does, it has to be written with nuance. What follows are just my observations, based on how the story has actually unfolded on screen.

Alas...here we go....

# First, Wenclair is an accidental love story...

Viewed through a narrative lens, Wenclair plays like a slow-burn romance. The arc is textbook: annoyance - tolerance - deep emotional bond. The emotional beats are unmistakably framed with romantic coding, *whether intentional or not.*

Take ""The Hug"" in the Season 1 finale. It’s one of the only moments where Wednesday initiates physical affection, and it’s with someone who offers her unconditional care. The camera lingers, the score swells with the track literally titled “The Hug,” and it lands with unusual intimacy. For a character who recoils from touch, this is staged as the equivalent of a first kiss.

Layer that against Wednesday’s betrayal by Tyler in the same finale. She risks opening up to him, only to learn she was being manipulated. Yet she still opens up to Enid immediately afterward and *chooses* to trust her. That’s a deliberate narrative contrast: Tyler represents betrayal, Enid represents trust.

Then there’s Enid’s werewolf transformation in the same finale. After a season of struggling to “wolf out,” she finally embraces her full self only when Wednesday’s life is at stake. It’s not framed as just Enid’s growth....it’s framed as her bond with Wednesday unlocking her strength. That’s a classic “true love’s power” beat.

Season 2 also makes the romantic framing even harder to dismiss because it gives us explicit dialogue that ties their bond to love-story language. Enid tells Wednesday, *“You’re my pack”* \- a declaration that, within werewolf lore, is the deepest possible bond of loyalty, belonging, and love. Earlier, she called Wednesday *“the light at the end of my tunnel,”* a metaphor often reserved for romantic partners, not casual friends. These lines aren’t tossed-off quips; they’re emotional confessions. To top it off that Enid risks her own humanity to save Wednesday's life by turning into an Alpha not during a full moon.

On Wednesday’s side, her emotions around Enid consistently push past her usual stoicism. Whenever Enid is in danger - or worse, when Wednesday believes she has died, her fear is visceral. Her convulsing vision of Enid’s grave is unlike any other vision she’s had, overwhelming her completely. That level of vulnerability is *unique to Enid:* she doesn’t collapse like that over Tyler, Xavier, or even her own family. In narrative terms, Enid’s safety is her breaking point, **the one thing that strips away her control and reveals her deepest attachment when she is in a state (visions) where she can't hide behind her walls.**

Taken together, Enid’s spoken declarations of love and belonging, paired with Wednesday’s uncontrollable fear of losing her, mirror the classic push-pull of a romance arc: confession and vulnerability, fear and devotion. The show doesn’t code this dynamic with anyone else, which is *why Wenclair feels less like subtext and more like the actual emotional throughline of the series.*

Enid isn’t just a foil or sidekick, she’s central to Wednesday’s character arc. At her core, Wednesday fears intimacy, hides behind detachment, and avoids vulnerability. Enid challenges that directly. She doesn’t sneak past Wednesday’s defenses, she makes Wednesday *choose* to let her in. That’s why the hug lands like a kiss, and why the vision of Enid’s death destroys her in a way no other vision has.

Outside those climaxes, their day-to-day dynamic still mirrors romance coding: opposites attract, emotional anchors, reconciliations filmed like breakups and makeups. Enid is consistently the one who breaks through Wednesday’s walls - not with force, but with trust. **Again narratively, Wenclair isn’t subtext anymore; it’s text.**

# Now to Wyler....the stereotypical production trope

By contrast, Wyler follows familiar production beats: coffee shop flirting, date, kiss, betrayal. It’s a textbook “broody boy/guarded girl” storyline. The Hyde reveal adds a gothic twist, but at its core, it’s still the standard misunderstood-boy trope we’ve seen in countless YA dramas. Again, nothing wrong with that, but in comparison to Wenclair (which again could have been completely accidental) is lackluster and unoriginal.

Yes, betrayal and angst make for compelling drama. I have my fair share of fandom shipping that are like that, and I will be free to admit that they are unhealthy (but it's fiction so I get it Wyler fans lol) So the Addams Family’s gothic world is a natural home for an enemies-to-lovers arc. But Wyler doesn’t deepen Wednesday’s character. Instead, it risks flattening her into another “intelligent girl falls for dangerous boy who was just misunderstood and ACTUALLY does love her” cliché.

The Hyde twist adds some intrigue (“what were his real intentions?”), but it doesn’t erase that Tyler manipulated her (whether intentional or not, the result was still the same). For Wyler to work again, the writers would **need** a highly convincing redemption arc. Especially because if you look at the Wednesday Sub-Reddit, everyone is looking into the subtext of Tyler's words/actions/facial expressions, etc, more so than the *actual text* of Tyler's innocence, and what's his will vs his masters. Without a proper character arc or redemption story, any reunion risks feeling unearned and, more importantly, undermining Wednesday’s intelligence. Which if written well, good for Wyler, but for the love of God, make it *convincing.*

So at the end of the day the difference is simple: The Wyler ship thrives on chaos and possible redemption and the Wenclair ship thrives on connection and growth. One has teared Wednesday down, and the other has built her up. One is already canonically present, while the other is based on if the show follows a stereotypical production narrative.

This is why Wenclair already *feels* like the real love story of the show, even if the writers never make it explicit. **Enid is Wednesday’s emotional anchor, not Tyler.** The beats, the framing, and the music all reinforce that their connection is the one that matters *most* to Wednesday's character.

In the end Wyler is about angst, danger, and production-driven tropes and Wenclair is about trust, growth, and transformation (literally lol).

Both are familiar narrative patterns, but only one elevates Wednesday’s character instead of undermining her. And that’s why Wenclair doesn’t just “work”, it already functions as Wednesday’s most *authentic* romance, whether or not the writers ever choose to canonize it. That is the appeal to Wenclair narratively over Wyler (imo)

You’ve got some coffee dates lined up.

But, now you’re asking yourself…

HOW and WHAT should you charge?

Do you charge 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭?

How about a 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭 of each deal?

Should you pass on SMS and AI costs to the biz?

What about a setup fee?

Or monthly retainer?

My ethos…

Make it EASY for that business to say yes ;)

>That’s exactly why the free [**“Survive to Thrive” Playbook**](https://honeysyed.com/flexxable) is so powerful, it shows you 5 simple AI strategies and deal structures designed to remove risk for business owners and make your offer a no-brainer.

And the best way to find out what’s going to get them slobbering…

Is to ASK!

Here’s how I’d do it.

Before arranging a coffee date and doing a demo, I’d be asking:

“How many leads do you generate per month?”...

“How many appointments do you book from those?”...

“What % of the appointments do you close?”...

“How big is your database of old leads?”...

“Are you advertising?”...

“How much is a sale worth to you?...

“What’s your gross profit per sale?”...

(I call all this the 'doctor’s diagnosis')

Once you’re up to speed…

Not only can you 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥 that will get them to HELL YES quicker than Usain Bolt’s 100m record.

But you’ll also get clear on 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 you can expect to be paid.

For example:

Let's say they are generating 100 leads per month, and have a database of 5K

I would say…

“𝘖𝘒, 𝘐 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘸𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘥𝘰 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦, 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘯𝘦𝘸𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘐 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘥𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘢 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘴, 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘯𝘰 𝘤𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘶𝘱 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘵”.

“𝘐𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦 1 𝘰𝘯 10 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦, 𝘺𝘰𝘶’𝘥 𝘣𝘢𝘯𝘬 $1800 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦”.

“𝘞𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘺𝘰𝘶?”

If the numbers stack for them, it's going to be an EASY YES.

If you want to go another way…

You could say…

“𝘐 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘵 1 𝘪𝘯 10 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘴𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦 $3𝘒 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘴 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘵 𝘱𝘦𝘳 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘦?”

“𝘋𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘺𝘰𝘶?”

The faster you get these potential AI partners to YES…

The quicker you’ll start putting dollars in your bank and theirs.

But, remember…

There’s 𝐧𝐨 “𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐥” answer.

Some businesses would rather pay a $20k upfront fee and $5k monthly retainer.

Others would run for the hills at the thought of that.

So, have the conversation.

Get to know the business.

And agree on a deal structure that both of you feel comfortable with, so that everyone is super motivated to start.

1nvnc0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nvnc0l/should_i_get_evicted/,Should I get evicted?,"I am a grad student in my last semester. I've tried to get a job for 2 years with absolutely no luck. Tutoring has gone well, but I don't have any income over summer or holidays. I'm a single adult woman without family help. I received my final payout last month, $15000, and I was given a kind extension on rent by the company for 5 months. This leaves me $6700 to pay if I am to avoid eviction. They have threatened to start the eviction process if I don't pay it all at once. DC has great renter's rights laws; it'd be a long and expensive process on their side.

To preface the situation: the apartment is a tiny, shared space impacted with the 5 of us (6th incoming); 3 African immigrants and a young American woman with moderate autism. We have private rooms which are nice and newly built. I assume I was placed here because my name is African. I'm American. The noise is constant -- screaming, extremely loud conversations, tribal chanting and praying, music, video games, sex, everything else. It goes up at 11 pm and slows down by 3am. So the #1 issue is that I never sleep, I have been sleep deprived for the entire 13 months I've been here. I will not graduate on time and have to do an extra semester due to the fact that my thesis progress has come to a standstill.

A secondary issue is the kitchen. We share a small kitchen-living room which is always occupied by a LARGE full african meal, pungent odors and racks of fermented meat odors fill everyone's bedrooms for 3 days. I've used several bottles of febreze and plugins, my purifier has helped but the lingering stench is horrid. We have NO windows. 13 hours of cooking all weekend, and then there are 7 huge containers in our one fridge. The freezer sometime stays open and melts all the food, including their giant flinstones meats. They trigger the smoke alarm every single time, 2am or 2pm. They refuse to use the dishwasher, so the sink is always piled up and the ""clean"" dishes cover our only counter space. They aren't sanitary with the ice, so every drink I have at home is warm. There is no space for my food in the fridge, but if I do leave my few (vegan) groceries in there, I will see them thrown under a giant bag of fermenting dripping meat. They also eat my food and drink my coffee and almond creamer, so that's an added expense. I've given up on using the kitchen and resorted to just eating the dry and canned ""meals"" under my bed and eating from the vending machines on campus. I've lost 14 lbs since I've moved here, and my professor was extremely concerned. I saw a doctor who said that I was under an immense amount of stress, and found lumps in my lymph nodes.

The tertiary issue is boundaries, they don't exist. If my lingerie are in the laundry, a male will dry them, fold them, and leave them on the couch. I told him directly not to touch my things, because it's my day to do laundry. He pretended I said nothing. This continues every week. They also bring my packages and mail out of the shared box, open them, and leave them on the counter (which I do not use, so it'd take me days to realize it wasn't stolen). They'll invite friends, the entire extended family, have them stay a week, and not even mention that there's a stranger sleeping in our cramped space or for how long. The ONLY way anyone communicates is via notes on my fridge whiteboard, and if they don't like the message, they erase it or respond aggressively.

Lastly, the administration does absolutely nothing. I've explained all of these problems over and over, begging for a new room, and they ignored me, just requesting more money. Wifi and maid service are included, but the barest minimum. The elevator and wifi goes out at least once weekly. I cannot WFH because my job was threatened after my students couldn't reach me. I have to go to the library to offer tutoring service.

Today, they entered with no notice (while I was at my research lab) and started showing my room to someone.

1nvnajt,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1nvnajt/my_store_manager_was_talking_shit_about_me_what/,my store manager was talking shit about me- what should i do,"so i just starting working at a new store. it just opened last week but i was training at a different one in the area. my store manager was really nice in my interview and aware of the fact i just moved here and was new to starbucks (i have coffee experience just not starbucks) we had a good first shift and then he started co managing a new store. so me and my other co workers stopped hearing from him lowkey. well i got covid and strep back to back so i was calling out due to the sickness. my other coworker who i’m fairly close to now also got sick with strep and called out as well. 
i found out from my trainer who i became friends with and regularly text, that my store manager was talking about me and my co worker to the store manager we were training at and our trainer would how we, by name, weren’t showing up to work. my trainer was like “i’m sure they have a reason” and my store manager was like “yeah well i need people who will show up.” so my trainer texted me and told me the situation being like ??? i told her i have covid and she said my store manager never brought that up. dude ??? then the week our store opened and nobody knew if we were open or not, i text him like are we opening tomorrow and he’s like “i’m on vacation, text this person.” BRO??? i literally can’t stand him. he’s so rude and i get he is managing two stores, one that is brand new but he wants our store to be the most up to standard when we are a very green store and everybody was trained differently. he’s so nit-picky and obsessed with being perfect all the time. i would be more inclined to have that mindset if he wasn’t presenting me in a bad light for no reason. anyways any advice on how to move forward? i like my coworkers but he is lowkey ruining this work environment for me.
