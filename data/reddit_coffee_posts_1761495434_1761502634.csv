I’ve seen people describe both positive and negative side effects of mixing caffeine with this medication but nothing about stomach cramps. For reference i was on this medication for about a year and tapered off because i felt more stable but now im back on it (first week in)and i forgot how sensitive my stomach gets when i have coffee on bupropion. I don’t have any of the common side effects ive heard people talk about like shaking, anxiety, headaches, irritability, etc when drinking coffee but i’ve noticed as soon as i have my morning coffee i start getting moderate stomach pains that are very period cramp like. I usually only have one cup a day, 5 days a week (when i’m working) and rarely ever have coffee on my days off, i use to drink way more so i’m not a light weight when it comes to caffeine or anything like that, i’ve just limited my intake over the years. This happened the first time i was on it as well but eventually faded im just curious to know if anyone else experiences this? ",1,1761502502.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

She said she wanted her favorite perfume. So I got that for her. So now that she has THAT, I literally don’t know what else to get her when it comes to Christmas time.

Background: My mom doesn’t use candles, they cause her anxiety of possible fires. She’s hot natured, so I can’t gift her blankets. She’s doesn’t drink coffee. Doesn’t drink teas. She doesn’t cook, she doesn’t bake. She doesn’t wear jewelry. She’s a nurse so she’s in her scrubs weekly and doesn’t really wear much else (I’ve been thinking about getting her some nice jeans or a good shirt that she’d like but she’s very picky). She’s very picky. She hates flowers. She’s trying to lose weight so I’m trying to refrain from getting her a bunch of candy or something. She has two cats and I was honestly thinking about getting her one of those self cleaning litter boxes but they’re soooo expensive and I’m literally a teenager. She doesn’t reallly do self care, like she doesn’t care for much other than body wash, deodorant, tooth paste/toothbrush, conditioner/shampoo… the basic hygiene routine. She doesn’t really have many hobbies.. she likes to read but she hasn’t been reading in the past few years. She has headaches all the time. She’s been very insecure about her wrinkles and discolored skin (kinda yellow ish). Please don’t say one of those electric picture frames cause my mom’s not a very sentimental person. What should I get her? Just kinda throwing ideas out there. I’m scared to spend a lot on her because people have bought stuff in the past for her and she’s just given it away because she didn’t like it or felt it didn’t suit her, for example, my sister bought her a set of perfumes from some store and my mom hasn’t used any and it’s been like a year or two. Sister noticed my mom had been wearing a specific shoe brand a lot so she bought her a new pair of shoes in that brand and my mom literally gave them away to me (I literally live so far away from them, only see them on Christmas/summer). The only thing my mom asks for during the holidays is her favorite perfume. But I’d like to think outside the box and get her more things that aren’t just the obvious, so help ya girl out please!!",1,1761502443.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

Have you ever felt so mentally sick and frustrated that your eyes get all red and bloodshot? That happened to me last night... I came to the realization this has to STOP!





I've been sitting in my room ALL DAY LONG. Listening to my Step Dad bitch and complain. I'm going insane. I should be out of the house like most 31-year-olds.





They say no friends is as deadly as smoking. That sums things up. I need a friend, and eventually a partner. It's amazing how friendship can improve our mood.





I don't want to isolate. But I feel like I wear the crazy scarlet letter. Everyone can tell that I'm mentally ill. And the bullying messed up my social skills. I have difficulty making friends.





I have massive headaches from the frustration. I listen to music loudly with headphones all day long. I'm sexually frustrated and repressed. I'm on a mega regimen of medication.





My mom doesn't cook anymore. So I eat a lot of unhealthy foods - fried foods, chicken wings, Halal lamb over rice, pizza hut, etc. I eat a lot of sweets like chocolate. I drink A LOT of coffee, sweet drinks, like Gatorade, and vitamin water. My diet is AWFUL.





If this had been going on a few days, or months, I wouldn't complain. But it's years now. I'm afraid of brain damage or cancer.





I beg people on social media, ""Can someone please rescue me soon? Because I don't see myself saving myself any time soon. Someone help me!"" But no one replies.





I like to imagine Billy Joel is my biological father, that I have a long-lost sibling who is going to save me, that Taylor Swift knows who I am. The reality is, I have to save myself.





I looked into theater/acting at Nassau Community College. I thought about starting in the winter, and I'm really excited about it. It might take a few semesters to complete, and I'll be a decade older than everyone. But what else am I doing? I'm passionate about this. The lady even complimented me on my announcer-like voice. I'm very theatrical.





My dad is telling me to get a part-time job. I don't think working for a big corporation is too smart at this point in my recovery. I think something understanding like a recovery group or a college class is like dipping my feet into the water.





How do you think I should climb out of this hell? Basically, getting out of the house and not sitting in my room is key. I'm waiting for someone to push me, I need to push myself.

Painful as it is to contemplate, you must build your own recover, step by step, rather than count on someone rescuing you in one grand moment. You can do it. I am away until after Thanksgiving, but will still be looking at emails.

Thank you very much.





I will be going into the fountain house today.





I'm going to switch from communications unit to education, and focus on getting back into college for theatre / acting. Hopefully, FH can help!

1ogrh9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/finch/comments/1ogrh9l/effective_goal_ideas/,Effective goal ideas…,"Hi! I’ve found that the “effectiveness” of finch is really dependent on the goals I pick- and that it helps when they are super specific! I wanted to share a couple that have worked well for me and I would love to hear what has made a difference for you! 
Preface with: I’m ADHD and a very “out of sight out of mind” person. But finch is somehow charming enough that I remember to check it every morning- it’s hugely effective for just putting my goals in front of my face regularly! Some things I just don’t want to do, but most things I genuinely forget. 
1) “look at calendar in morning” (with a reminder/push notification) Soooo many times I have missed appointments or not brought what I needed for the day because I just didn’t check my calendar before leaving the house. This is such an easy AM win, and it has saved my butt many times. It’s usually as easy as picking up something and tossing it in my bag, and it improves my whole day (I was wasting lots of gas driving home to get things, missing therapy appointments, etc.)
2) this is a pair- “run dishwasher at night” and “empty dishwasher in morning” honestly number one life changer for home cleanliness. I can’t overstate how much this has helped me. I can unload it in the time it takes my coffee to brew, and when it’s able to receive dishes all day they don’t pile up in the sink. This is a tip from “a slob comes clean” and I am a BELIEVER. (If you feel guilty about running it half empty, it’ll force you to go look around your house for more stuff… and if you’re like me you will find tea and coffee cups everywhere lol) for me I can’t do “every other day” habits well, I either need a daily habit stack or it just won’t stick. Also dishes come cleaner when they don’t sit as long, I have room for pots and pans, etc.
3.) skip that drink tonight- I make this two goals because to me it’s worth an extra little reward.

If you know how to make the laundry process make sense I would love to know that’s one thing I can’t seem to hack!!!!!!",2,1761502028.0,finch,0,1.0,False
1ogrgxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banned_on_reddit/comments/1ogrgxv/1227_catch/,[1227] Catch,"I gotta get a little free-wheeling. The last 2 days my energy levels have been off or confusing, but now I’m on the brink of sliding back into a more productive and active place. This is causing some messy thoughts to coalesce marginally more coherently.

I was trying to land on a word to describe what I “fear.” Fear isn’t the right word though. It’s the vague approximate way to couch what I feel, but I’m not actually afraid. There’s a lot of words that fit under the vague fear umbrella that, when combined, would start to get at what I feel.

I’m “exhausted,” in a way that’s akin to the Nietzschean use of the term. I’m “confused,” less about the mechanics of why or how things play out, but that they should do so in a demanding and persistent way. I’m “curious” for an unknown-unknown black-swan kind of surprise or solution to what feel like intractable problems.

I wouldn’t have to search for a list of 100 things that are “wrong” or “unjust” or “unfair” or “ridiculous” or “backwards” or “horrifying” regarding our political environment, “leaders,” and the consequences of their behavior. It seems like every waking moment of my life is an invitation to suffer and react with as base a hatred and dread for what’s happening as exists. Every single moment of every single day I’m reminded of something that’s trying to kill me or something I care about. Every single day I’m clued into a threat to my future, what I care about, and the world I’d wish to leave.

What prevents real “fear” from kicking in is thinking at scale. I know we’re infinitely small. I know time rages on. I know, fundamentally, all feeling and indulgent selfish complaints are choices. I can make that same choice as any given fascist, or I can do this. I can continue to advocate for my values, patience, and imagined future no matter how hot the fire they’re burning me with gets. It’s taken years to recognize that in order for that to qualify as a decision, it can’t be made in spite. The fascists are spiteful. They are at the mercy of that spite.

I think in probabilities. My feelings tend to align with how more or less probable I think something is. I think we are a fantastic force for creative good. I think we’re considerably more likely to let the insatiable bad overwhelm until we hit a kind of default restart state. I think apocalyptic narratives are popular for this reason. We all kind of assume that we’ll get tribal. We all bet that the richest will continue to get rich and exploit and there will be a permanent underclass. The best we get to do is imagine ourselves in the boardroom or bunker contemplating what’s happening “out there.”

When I think about things long-term or at scale, it prompts me to consider myself in a hyper-local way. I’m not making the decisions to starve children across the globe or knee-cap mRNA vaccines. I’m not setting arbitrary tariffs or dumping forever chemicals into water supplies. I’m not trying to incorporate the evil, waste, and stupidity of anything I’m a part of to justify the consequences. I mean, sure, as a normal human I exist in a state that has to do that in an existentially default sort of way, but it’s not my compulsion. It’s not my cope. I make reference to what I build, and why I built it, regularly for this reason. I need a standing refutation to the arbitrary, greedy, vindictive death that surrounds me.

I do think those of us on more or less the same reasonable page do ourselves a huge disservice by the language we use. I’m angry when someone says “misinformation” instead of “lies.” People are just lying, and have been, for decades. It’s not abstract. It’s not polite. There will never be enough people who die in service to it to trigger some kind of moral awakening. You have to call it a lie and you have to speak the truth, every single time, every single day. If you can’t tell it’s a lie or if you can’t make yourself face and identify it, the game is over.

I’m sympathetic to the idea that it’s incredibly hard to articulate. This is the 1,227<sup>th</sup> time I’ve tried to find the words for what I’m feeling. This is the forever-process I’ve identified that seeks to land on one most-true statement after the next, sentence by sentence, eagerly searching for the novelty or insight that makes the next moment go down smoother. I’m a solutions-oriented thinker. You want to vent? You better make that clear, or I’m going to reflexively start offering “fixes” like this.

In a hyper-local way, I can and do continue to build my own little environments. I get presented with the exact same kinds of choices as those shaking up the world, and I can choose to hold myself accountable to the standards they forgo. I can also see where the conflicts and contradictions can turn into excuses. I’m using recycled materials for a fence I’m building. I also burn trash. I’m concerned about the environment, but obviously more concerned about the cost and inconvenience of disposing of waste in other ways. I also don’t know that it’s not going to get burned anyway given what I’ve read about global waste systems. I’m likely just saving time.

If I felt guilt or less comprehensive in my reading and behavior, ignoring that guilt would be the dangerous sin and precarious place that allows for unending excuse-ridden catastrophe. If you can show me we have a real recycling process or show me we’re holding the corporations accountable for implementing production processes, I’ll go out of my way to ask for paper instead of plastic to bag my groceries. Most days, it’s one of a million things that’s going to give me a micro-dose of stress I can’t really do anything about.

I don’t think it’s hard to figure out what you can do locally. I think it’s hard to stay mindful about the nature of your locality. We’re, seemingly, infinitely distracted, not just by the horrors, but by the placations. We’ve got hundreds and thousands of hours invested in our entertainment. We’ve got incredibly stressful and often-meaningless jobs. We’ve got our health issues. We’ve got our kids and pets. We’ve got the dictums and pain points and policy of evening the most well-meaning and fulfilling spaces we may have found. The accumulation of small pleasantries, acts of defiance, or utilitious indulgence can often feel futile or resonate as a form of mockery.

I arrange my space to be useful to me. I don’t have to knock down historic monuments in raging metaphorical ways in order to feel at home. I try to eat and drink that which fills me with joy or comfort. I try to allow myself outlets for when inspiration hits. I don’t use my tools and instruments every day. Every single moment I do speaks overwhelmingly to a need that can’t be met another way. I need to create. I need to build. I need to see manifest in the world what I’m feeling in a way the last thing I wrote doesn’t meet.

The things that have chronically plagued me become merely useful foundational information for the next choices I wish to make. My personality isn’t one for addiction, but I empathize with being chronically unable to resolve problems that feel infinite. I can’t “fix fascism,” right? I can’t convince the brain worms to protect our collective health. I can’t talk a billionaire off the anti-Christ cliffs. I can’t line up the pedophiles and let the victims take their revenge.

I can talk about them. I can tell the truth. I can go back outside and keep building my fence. I can ensure the 8 people living in my first sober-living house feel like their needs are being met in a timely way. I can enjoy my coffee. I’m going to keep going to my concerts, comedy shows, theater productions, beer fest, and honking enthusiastically at anyone on a corner holding a sign protesting the unnecessary death of us all.

I think the practical, tangible work of survival is a messy congregation of all the memes, protests, “EVISCERATION” moments in punditry and debate, but needs to be undergirded by the same kind of persistent survival network at exists in fascist forms. I’m encouraged by all of the extremely-local efforts to get school-board people elected. I’m encouraged by the run-for-something crowds building infrastructure in areas long abandoned. I like the hard numbers showing what you can do for 1 million dollars when we’re seeing how to routinely waste billions. Someday, in a bigger way than merely alluding to those efforts at the end of a personal coping strategy, I hope to be part of telling those stories and connecting as many people as possible to the large plurality that already \*gets it.\* I’ve heard the term “reality-based community” a few times recently, already poised to get pitted against The Truest Truth-Tellers or Perfect-Faithers, I’m sure.

I say often enough how easy things are to understand when you consider children. You don’t debate a child about how much sugar they get to eat, bed time, bathing, or school. You do if you’re a moron or liberal caricature, but not if you, even only intuitively, understand what a child is. Not if you grasp that the infinite ignorance and precarity of youth can get you killed instantly. Not if you feel curious and excited about what that child can be with the right kind of direction and vision. We are forever children. We betray that child by pretending we’re equally as helpless to fix or change something as they are. We’ve been riding excuses for decades. We’ve been pretending there aren’t concerted efforts designed to kill and control us by weaponizing and systematizing our vulnerabilities.

Three days. The silence was a living entity in my apartment. The gallery was a refuge, a space I could control, but at night, the quiet pressed in. I didn't hear from Aiden. The cease-and-desist letter had done its job. The news continued its grim litany of Kingsley Global's collapse. I watched it all from a distance, a spectator to a tragedy I had narrowly escaped.



My phone buzzed, a welcome intrusion. It was Nella.



*""Sophie, you need to see this. An email just came to the gallery's general inbox.""*



I opened my laptop. The email was from an anonymous encrypted server.



***Subject: An Invitation***



***Ms. Rhodes,***



***You don't know me, but we share a common problem. Her. I have information. The kind that can end this. Meet me tonight. 10 PM. The old waterfront warehouse, pier 7. Come alone. Tell no one, especially not your brother. If you involve the police, the information disappears forever.***



***- A Friend***



My blood ran cold. It was a trap. It had to be. But the phrase *""the kind that can end this""* echoed in my mind. What if it wasn't? What if this was the break I needed?



Lucas would lock me in my apartment if he knew. The police would scare the source away. This was a decision I had to make alone.



I typed a quick, timed email to Lucas and my lawyer, *Martin Croft*, set to send at midnight. If you're reading this, I'm at pier 7. Investigate.



Then I grabbed my keys and a heavy steel flashlight from the closet. I wasn't going to be a victim. I was going as a hunter.



***POV: Aiden***



The world had shrunk to the four walls of my study. Empty coffee cups and legal briefs littered every surface. My company was in freefall. The board had turned into a den of snakes, each one trying to save their own skin. Chip was in the wind, his betrayal a festering wound.



My phone buzzed. Not a number, but a location alert. A tracking app I’d installed on Sophie’s phone during a better time, a paranoid security measure for a wife I’d often left alone. I’d never disabled it. I’d forgotten it existed.



The alert showed her location moving toward the industrial waterfront. A desolate, dangerous area at night.



A cold dread, sharper than any corporate fear, seized me. This wasn't a gallery event. This was something else.

 *Alessia.*



The cease-and-desist letter burned in my mind. Any further contact... will result in immediate legal action.



But this wasn't contact. This was… a warning. An instinct. If I was wrong, I’d face her legal wrath. If I was right…



I grabbed my jacket and car keys, moving on an impulse deeper than reason. The law could damn me later. Tonight, I wouldn't let history repeat itself.



***POV: Alessia***



The warehouse was perfect. Decaying, isolated, the air thick with the smell of salt and rust. I stood in the shadows of the second-floor gantry, watching the single door.



She came, just as I knew she would. So predictably brave. *Sophie Rhodes,* the avenging artist, clutching a pathetic flashlight like a sword.



She stepped into the pool of dim light from a single hanging bulb. *""Hello?""* Her voice was steady, but I could hear the tension in it. *""I'm here.""*



I pressed a button on a remote. The heavy warehouse door slammed shut behind her, the boom echoing through the vast space.



She spun around, a flashlight beam cutting wildly through the darkness.



*""Hello, Sophie.""* My voice, amplified by a small speaker, echoed around her. She couldn't see me.



*""What is this? What information do you have?""*



*""I have the truth,""* I said, my voice dripping with false sympathy. *""The truth about Aiden. He knew about the corporate espionage plot weeks ago. He let it happen. He needed a scapegoat for his failing company, and he chose you. The* ***'joint statement'?*** *A calculated move to make his story more believable. He's been playing you from the start.""*



I could see her body tense, a silhouette of doubt and anger. The lie was perfect because it fed the narrative she was already primed to believe—that he was capable of any cruelty.

*""Because he needs to pay,""* I hissed, letting real venom into my voice. *""And you're going to help me. You're going to testify that he conspired with you to fabricate the scandal, to manipulate the stock price. You'll be the star witness in his destruction.""*



She was silent, processing the monstrous proposal.



This was the gambit. Turn her. Use her justified anger to become the instrument of his ruin. It was the most elegant form of revenge.



***POV: Sophie***



His voice echoed around me, a bodiless serpent hissing lies. **He knew. He chose you.** The words found every crack in my armor, every lingering doubt.



But then I saw it. A flicker of movement on the metal gantry above. A shadow detaching itself from the deeper shadows.



***Alessia.***



And in that moment, the entire house of cards collapsed. This wasn't a source. This was a puppet master, trying to pull my strings.



*""You're lying,""* I said, my voice louder, clearer now. *""You always lie. This isn't about me testifying against him. This is about you wanting to own what's left of him. You can't stand that even broken, he'll never be yours.""*



The silence from the speaker was deafening. I had struck a nerve.



Then, a new sound. A scrape at the door. Before I could react, a side door I hadn't seen flew open.



Aiden stood there, silhouetted against the night sky, his chest heaving.



*""Alessia!""* he roared, his voice raw with a fury that shook the very foundations of the warehouse.



It was a trap. But he had walked into it too.



***POV: Alessia***



Perfect. This was better than I could have planned.



He came. The noble fool. He couldn't help himself.



Now they were both here. In my arena.



I clicked off the speaker and drew the small, sleek pistol from my coat pocket. It wasn't about killing. It was about theater. About forcing a final, irreversible choice.



I stepped into the light of the gantry, looking down at them both.



*""How romantic,""* I said, my voice no longer amplified, but cutting through the silence. *""The traitor and the fool. Together again.""*



I raised the gun, not at him, but at her.



*""Time to choose, Aiden. One last time. Your company, or her life?""*

Kind Stranger - the coffee and matcha selection are extensive and delicious. The man who works there is also really sweet and I always feel so welcomed - even when I’m pushing a grizzly baby in a pram. Food is ok, drinks are 10/10

Ano-Ne - a beautiful little Japanese bakery/cafe. Their sandwiches and cakes are delicious and they do great matcha. It’s a very quiet and calm atmosphere so perfect when baby is sleeping

Coffee Penn - Food and drinks are both 10/10 and I love being able to sit outside 

Small Mercies - great matcha (I ask for it to be unsweetened) and obviously incredible food. Owners are super nice and it’s a good spot to sit outside and people watch.

I am looking for a game I used to play 13-15 years ago. I will share what I remember from the game.

**Platform**: PC: browser game, Flash-based most likely

**Genre**: Fashion / Shopping / Casual Life Simulation

**Estimated year of release**: I was playing it around 2010–2012 (approximately 13-15 years ago), I am quite unsure about year of release but I assume around these years.

**Graphics/art style**: 2D side view or semi-2D perspective.

**What I remember from the game**: The main character was realistically designed and well-drawn. I might be wrong on this but I assume that game had ""world"", ""walking"" in the game title. Shops were aligned along a street view, not in menus. (I have checked this server for similiar games, but those games weren't what I was looking for)

**Notable characters**: Main character was a fashionable woman walking automatically along the street.

**Notable gameplay mechanics**: You could walk forward or backward along a shopping street (in the middle of the screen we see mc walking basically forward or backward) . Shops were on both sides (left and right). When you entered a shop, the screen changed to an interior view with clothes or accessories to purchase. You could collect or earn resources to buy outfits, shoes, bags. There was an energy system where you could refill energy with coffee or something similar. Locked shops ahead that became accessible after progress (possibly based on your level).

**Other details**: It was free, browser-based (no download). Not on Facebook or mobile, it was likely on Flash portal sites around 2010.

1ogrc3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1ogrc3w/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_i_slept_with/,AITA for not telling my husband I slept with someone during our 'thinking period' 15 years ago?,"We met in college. Things were casual at first. We hooked up, went on dates, but neither of us said we were serious. After about three months, he sat me down at this coffee shop and said he wanted us to be exclusive. He looked nervous. His hands were shaking when he reached across the table.

""I want this to be real,"" he said. ""Just you and me.""

I panicked. I told him I needed time to think about it. He seemed hurt but he said okay. He gave me space.

That weekend, I went to a party with my roommate. I got drunk. There was this guy from my economics class. We ended up sleeping together. I woke up the next morning feeling sick about it. Not because I regretted the guy, but because I realized I did want to be with my husband. Or boyfriend, whatever he was at that point.

I called him that Sunday. Told him yes, I wanted to be exclusive. He was so happy. We moved forward like nothing happened.

I never told him. I convinced myself it didn't count because we weren't officially together yet. Technically, I wasn't cheating. That's what I told myself for fifteen years.

We got married two years later. Had two kids. Built a whole life together. He's been the perfect husband. Supportive, loving, present. I buried that night so deep I almost forgot about it.

Then my sister found out last month.

She was visiting and we got wine drunk one night after the kids went to bed. I don't even know how it came up. We were talking about college and stupid things we did. It just slipped out. I laughed about it like it was some funny story from the past.

Her face changed immediately.

""Does he know?"" she asked.

""No, and he doesn't need to,"" I said. ""It was before we were official.""

""You're kidding yourself,"" she said. ""He asked you to be exclusive. You slept with someone else that same week. That's cheating.""

We argued. I told her to drop it. She wouldn't.

She kept texting me over the next few days. Saying I needed to tell him. That he deserved to know. That our entire marriage was built on a lie. I blocked her number.

Then she showed up at our house last week when my husband was home.

She told him everything. Right there in our living room. I watched his face crumble.

""Is this true?"" he asked me.

I tried to explain. I said it was complicated. That we weren't really together yet. That I was confused back then. That it didn't mean anything.

""I asked you to be with me,"" he said quietly. ""And you went and slept with someone else. Then you lied to me for fifteen years.""

""I didn't lie,"" I said. ""You never asked.""

""Because I trusted you,"" he said. His voice broke. ""I thought we started clean.""

My sister stood there watching. She looked almost satisfied. Like she'd done some noble thing.

My husband asked her to leave. Then he asked me to leave too.

I've been staying at a hotel for five days now. He won't answer my calls. His mom came and picked up the kids yesterday. She wouldn't even look at me. My mother in law, who I've known for thirteen years, treated me like garbage on the sidewalk.

My own mother says I should have told him years ago. That my sister did the right thing. That I'm the villain here.

But I don't get it. We weren't exclusive when it happened. He gave me time to think. I used that time. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have slept with someone else, but I was twenty years old and scared of commitment. Is that really worth destroying our family over?

My sister won't stop texting our family group chat about how she ""couldn't let him live a lie anymore."" She's acting like some hero. Meanwhile, my kids are asking why I'm not home. My husband is talking to a lawyer.

Fifteen years. Two kids. A mortgage. All of it gone because of something that happened before we were even really together.

**So tell me, am I actually the problem here?**

# 🏁 What's New and Why You Should Care

1. **The updaterd Film Details Section:** The film pages got a serious upgrade! Now you can see **box office details** and constantly updating ratings from all the big sites—**IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and The Movie Database**—right next to the Death Race Tracking average. It's your one-stop shop for film stats!
2. **📝 Notes Inclusion (Thank You,** u/YellowPudding**!):** Seriously, thank you for the suggestion! You can now add personal, private **notes** to your tracked films.
3. **✉️ The Letterboxd Importer (The Big New Feature!):** This is the **most requested** quality-of-life feature, and it's exclusively for **subscribers and donors** (atleast for now!). Log in, enter your Letterboxd username, and the importer tool at [https://beta.deathracetracking.com/import](https://beta.deathracetracking.com/import) will pull your **50-60 most recently logged films and ratings** directly into Death Race Tracking.

# 🤝 Help Me Keep the Engine Running (And Add More Races!)

Death Race Tracking is a passion project, but running the servers and services costs money. To keep the lights on and the updates flowing, I've added a way for the community to support the site:

* **Subscribe & Get the Importer:** A subscription is just **£12 per year** (using Stripe internally). That's less than a couple of coffees, and it **grants you access to the Letterboxd Importer** and other future premium features (including automatic Radarr lists for those of you who like automation).
* **More Subscribers = More Races!** As a huge thank you, for **every 5 new subscribers**, I'll add a **new race** to the tracker! You can see my current suggestions and make your own here on the roadmap: [https://beta.deathracetracking.com/roadmap](https://beta.deathracetracking.com/roadmap)

Right now I roast by sight/smell on an air roaster and get acceptable results - although I don't really know yet how changes in what I do affect the end result beyond end roast levels.  I don't have tools yet to accuratly measure temps, but after watching a few videos I'm wondering if I should even bother because I know I'll never be as accurate as these instructional videos depict with their roasting profiles.

  
For an example video:  I watched Virtual Coffee Lab's video on[ Creating a Followign a coffee roasting profile](https://youtu.be/ISh4OMHt--M).

  
It seemed like it has good information, but he seems to be accurate down to the 5 second range.  It seems like he creates a roasting profiile based on past experience and knows what times different events will happen.  Then as he's going through, he seems disappointed when events are off by a few seconds.  For example, he makes a big deal multiple times that [dry end was at 4:40 instead of 4:30](https://youtu.be/ISh4OMHt--M?t=828).

  
What? For one, how can you say that ""drying wasn't done 10 seconds ago, but it is done now""?  Can you know that down the the 5-10 second range since it's mostly about color changes? I bet if I recorded one of my roasts and replayed it 10 times and wrote down the dry end time, I'd probably have 10 different times all grouped around a 30 second time frame.

Then later in the video, he says first crack should occur at 8:00 and sure enough it occurs exactly at 8:00 **down to the second**.  

Again - What?!  How can you be so accurate that you'll know when first crack will occur down to the second (and that it'll be a nice round number and not like 7:57)?  Is this possible with home gear?  Should I except to be able to get this good?

  
For me, I'm still learning so I can guess when events may happen down to +/- 1 minute and total roast times +/- 2 minutes.  I expect with some practice and consistency (same beans and same steps) I'd be able to get down to +/- 30 seconds, but I don't expect I'll get more accurate than that - and not sure I'd want to put in the effort/resources to get that accurate either.  



Am I better off just ignoring profiles and temp graphs and stick to sight/smell?  Or is there value in the data?  ",2,1761501571.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

1ogr3g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ogr3g6/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son’s Halloween candy. Someone’s been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I… don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just…you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.* ""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my *Maxwell House* coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again. *Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.* *You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

My mind struggled to process what I was seeing. There was no way an intruder could have entered the house and taken a picture with an officer standing right there.

I flipped to the next one.

This one was of me in my bedroom, tucking my son into bed. And the way it was shot looked like something only possible in a dream. It was captured from a bird's-eye view, directly above our heads. A blade from the ceiling fan even cut into the edge of the frame. Because it was taken so close to the light, the shot was overexposed, which put a hazy kind of filter over it. This defied all logic.

To get that picture, whoever or \_what\_ever took it would have to have been suspended from the ceiling. They would have to have manipulated themselves into an impossible angle. All without me or Max knowing.

My hands were trembling now. The room was beginning to spin. Terrified now, I flipped to the final picture.

It was of me, my back facing the camera, standing in my kitchen. I was looking down. Studying something in my hands. Just like I was now, at this very moment. The shot was taken so close behind me, whatever had taken it could have reached out and touched me.

I needed to get Max out of the house. Right now.

*Click.*

Something snapped, directly behind my head. Then the room was quiet again. My mind took a moment to register what it even was. But slowly, a sick realization slithered up from the pit of my stomach.

What I had just heard was the shutter of a Polaroid camera.

The camera's inner mechanisms hummed as it worked to print out the picture. I froze. I stopped breathing. In a desperate attempt, I tried reasoning with the intruder.

""What do you want from me?"" I cried. I listened for a response, still holding the pictures in my trembling fingers. There was no reply.

The picture finished printing, and whatever was behind me stood perfectly still. Several seconds ticked by. Was it waiting for *me* to turn around?

Across the counter, against the back wall was a block of kitchen knives. I wished they were closer. But they were way out of reach. Depending on what happened next, maybe I could get to them. But for now, I would have to turn and face whatever was behind me, head on.

One slow inch at a time, I turned my head, my heart pounding inside my chest. I expected to be stabbed or choked or grabbed at any second. I turned a little bit further, then shot a glance back.

The kitchen was empty.

I exhaled-but a new fear, much greater than before, exploded inside me. *It's going to get Max.*

I dropped the pictures and shot around the counter and ripped out the biggest knife from the block. Then I dug out my phone and hit ""call"" on Officer Dan's contact.

*Call failed.*

I tapped the screen several more times.

*Call failed. Call failed. Call failed.* I slammed it on the counter in a fit of anger. Of all the times for my phone to not work, of course it would be now. I had no other option. I'd have to run upstairs and get Max by myself.

I moved through the downstairs with the knife aimed in front of me. I checked around every corner and every piece of furniture I passed. I sprinted up the stairs, then through the upstairs hallway, toward my bedroom.

I pushed the bedroom door open slowly, horrified that it had already beaten me there. Thankfully, Max was still under the covers, safe and sound. I peeled the blanket off him and scooped him up in my arms.

""Mommy?"" he said, rubbing his eyes.

""Shhh. We have to go. Stay quiet."" He wrapped his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder.

I crept over to the door and peeked into the hallway. Empty.

I carried Max down the hall, toward the stairs. If we could just make it out the front door, I'd run straight to the neighbors and call the cops from there. Just a short trip down the stairs and through the living room. We could do it.

When we neared the steps, I heard the worst noise imaginable. Footsteps pounding up the stairs.

My mind entered into fight or flight mode. Should I attack? Give Max a chance to run? No-I can't leave him. He'd never get away.

I backed up. To my right was my son's bedroom. I ducked inside and rushed to the closet. I inched open the door as quietly as I could, but still, it squealed on its hinges. We slid inside. There was barely enough space for both of us. I clicked the door shut and stood in front of Max, using my body as a shield.

""Mommy, what are we doing?""

I turned and cupped a hand over his mouth. ""Not. Another. Word.""

We listened. With each passing second, the footsteps grew closer, until they arrived at the bedroom door. Then they slowed to a nice and easy stroll and entered the room. Floorboards creaked under a shifting weight. Something paced across the room, from left to right, like it was searching for us. Once it reached the right wall, it stopped. Then turned. And moved toward the closet.

I tightened my grip on the knife. A stream of adrenaline coursed through my veins, making my skin tingle. I fought hard to keep my mind clear and focused. If the door opened, I would take them by surprise. Hammer the blade down in one, quick motion. It was all I had.

It came right up to the door. And stopped. The sound of our own breathing filled the closet. A floorboard creaked.

Every nerve inside my body screamed. *What is it doing? Why is it just standing there?* Then, a camera clicked. Through the gap under the door, a light flashed. Against all logic, all reason, it had taken a picture of the closet door.

A deep, yet childlike laughter vibrated into the closet. The camera clicked again. It knew exactly where we were, and it was playing games. It was toying with us. Max's body trembled behind me, and a soft whimper escaped from his lips.

I prepared myself. The door would open any moment. And it was up to me to save our lives.

I raised the knife so I could swing it down right as the door opened. I held my breath. I listened as the handle jiggled and began to turn. The door swung open.

I hacked the knife blindly in front of me. Officer Dan staggered backwards just in time.

""Whoa! Whoa!""

I darted my eyes around the room. Looking for it. Looking for blood. I was frantic.

""It's just me! It's just me. No one is here. I've got you. You're safe.""

""No we're not. It was just here. I heard-""

""We have multiple officers searching your home. No one is here.""

I scanned the room again. There was no camera. No creature. No obvious threat. The stress of what had just occurred began weighing down on me. I lost my sense of balance and stumbled. Officer Dan caught me by the arm. He guided me toward Max's bed. As I sat down, Max darted out from the closet and jumped onto the bed and clung onto me.

""You called me. Remember?"" Officer Dan said. ""But you didn't say anything, so we were afraid something had happened. We forced open the front door, then I heard you guys in here. Did you think he broke in?""

""I know he did. There were footsteps. And there's more pictures. Just look on the counter-""

""There are no signs of forced entry, Jenny."" Officer Dan paused and glanced over at the closet door. He ran his palms together, then approached the bed. He took a seat beside us. ""You know, sometimes, in high stress situations, our minds produce things-sounds, images, things like that-that aren't really there. It's *perfectly* normal. Given your…situation, it's possible that that's all that happened.""

""Don't talk to me like that, Dan. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I heard. You're a cop, not a therapist. Get off the bed.""

Once I'd snapped on him, Officer Dan had no more psychotherapeutic explanations for me. He stood and left us alone in the room. He left the house, in fact, but some of the other officers were kind enough to stay with us until morning. For the rest of the night, there were no more signs of the intruder.

\*\*\*

The next day, I applied for a credit card and checked us into a hotel. I also put that house on the market. A week later, someone bought it. I took the money and bought a new house in a completely different state. Even though the old one sold well under its value, I didn't care. As long as we left behind whatever was in there, we had all we needed.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,* I told myself. *Calm down, breathe. That's it.* *Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",3,1761501130.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Hello everyone,

I have been gifted an original 9 cup Bialetti Moka Express and started regularly brewing with it.

Thus I realized that an aluminum funnel is used to hold the coffee grounds, I know that coffee contains some organic acids and aluminum is very sensitive to all types of acids and alkaline solutions. As I intend to use the moka express longterm I have been desperatly searching for stainless steel funnels but haven´t found any which would be compatible with the model.

I have to assume that even the manufacturers funnels are not safe long term to use due to aluminum ions getting released with daily use. I don´t wish to return the gift but modify it.

Are there any stainless steel funnels out there which would be compatible ? Even from other brands or models ?

Thanks in advance!",2,1761501009.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

"" ABOUT ALO
What is ALO, A.KA. Animal Liberation Orchestra?
ALO is a lot of things. Put simply, it’s a rock band, a family, an artistic outlet, a community, a business. But that only scratches the surface of this 3O-year musical vision-quest. ALO is an adventure, it’s a Spring break road trip to Colorado, it’s an all-night drive from Salt Lake City to San Jose. It’s the comfort of hanging out with life-long friends, of relaxing on a couch and finding treasures hidden in its cushions. It’s a coffee table full of amazing books on art, philosophy and music. It feels old and new, fresh and classic. It holds tension and dreams and possibility in its folds. It hopes to unveil something magical, something unheard of, something the world needs. It smells of super burritos and vans full of lemons, old bongs and epic hikes. It’s a sound of growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area. It’s a sound of northern California, with sprinkles of Santa Barbara and Augusta, Georgia. It was born of childhood friendships, of shared destinies, of inside jokes and of a desire to make people happy. It’s not for everyone, although it tries to be. It wants you to love and share in its vision. It’s long and meandering, then suddenly sharp, abrupt!  It’s feral and clever, and it means you no harm. It’s love and freedom, collected and catalogued, then released back into the wilds from whence it came, over and over again. It’s an orchestrated liberation of our animal soul. ""

1ogqzvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1ogqzvw/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son’s Halloween candy. Someone’s been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I… don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just…you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.* ""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my *Maxwell House* coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again. *Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.* *You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

My mind struggled to process what I was seeing. There was no way an intruder could have entered the house and taken a picture with an officer standing right there.

I flipped to the next one.

This one was of me in my bedroom, tucking my son into bed. And the way it was shot looked like something only possible in a dream. It was captured from a bird's-eye view, directly above our heads. A blade from the ceiling fan even cut into the edge of the frame. Because it was taken so close to the light, the shot was overexposed, which put a hazy kind of filter over it. This defied all logic.

To get that picture, whoever or \_what\_ever took it would have to have been suspended from the ceiling. They would have to have manipulated themselves into an impossible angle. All without me or Max knowing.

My hands were trembling now. The room was beginning to spin. Terrified now, I flipped to the final picture.

It was of me, my back facing the camera, standing in my kitchen. I was looking down. Studying something in my hands. Just like I was now, at this very moment. The shot was taken so close behind me, whatever had taken it could have reached out and touched me.

I needed to get Max out of the house. Right now.

*Click.*

Something snapped, directly behind my head. Then the room was quiet again. My mind took a moment to register what it even was. But slowly, a sick realization slithered up from the pit of my stomach.

What I had just heard was the shutter of a Polaroid camera.

The camera's inner mechanisms hummed as it worked to print out the picture. I froze. I stopped breathing. In a desperate attempt, I tried reasoning with the intruder.

""What do you want from me?"" I cried. I listened for a response, still holding the pictures in my trembling fingers. There was no reply.

The picture finished printing, and whatever was behind me stood perfectly still. Several seconds ticked by. Was it waiting for *me* to turn around?

Across the counter, against the back wall was a block of kitchen knives. I wished they were closer. But they were way out of reach. Depending on what happened next, maybe I could get to them. But for now, I would have to turn and face whatever was behind me, head on.

One slow inch at a time, I turned my head, my heart pounding inside my chest. I expected to be stabbed or choked or grabbed at any second. I turned a little bit further, then shot a glance back.

The kitchen was empty.

I exhaled-but a new fear, much greater than before, exploded inside me. *It's going to get Max.*

I dropped the pictures and shot around the counter and ripped out the biggest knife from the block. Then I dug out my phone and hit ""call"" on Officer Dan's contact.

*Call failed.*

I tapped the screen several more times.

*Call failed. Call failed. Call failed.* I slammed it on the counter in a fit of anger. Of all the times for my phone to not work, of course it would be now. I had no other option. I'd have to run upstairs and get Max by myself.

I moved through the downstairs with the knife aimed in front of me. I checked around every corner and every piece of furniture I passed. I sprinted up the stairs, then through the upstairs hallway, toward my bedroom.

I pushed the bedroom door open slowly, horrified that it had already beaten me there. Thankfully, Max was still under the covers, safe and sound. I peeled the blanket off him and scooped him up in my arms.

""Mommy?"" he said, rubbing his eyes.

""Shhh. We have to go. Stay quiet."" He wrapped his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder.

I crept over to the door and peeked into the hallway. Empty.

I carried Max down the hall, toward the stairs. If we could just make it out the front door, I'd run straight to the neighbors and call the cops from there. Just a short trip down the stairs and through the living room. We could do it.

When we neared the steps, I heard the worst noise imaginable. Footsteps pounding up the stairs.

My mind entered into fight or flight mode. Should I attack? Give Max a chance to run? No-I can't leave him. He'd never get away.

I backed up. To my right was my son's bedroom. I ducked inside and rushed to the closet. I inched open the door as quietly as I could, but still, it squealed on its hinges. We slid inside. There was barely enough space for both of us. I clicked the door shut and stood in front of Max, using my body as a shield.

""Mommy, what are we doing?""

I turned and cupped a hand over his mouth. ""Not. Another. Word.""

We listened. With each passing second, the footsteps grew closer, until they arrived at the bedroom door. Then they slowed to a nice and easy stroll and entered the room. Floorboards creaked under a shifting weight. Something paced across the room, from left to right, like it was searching for us. Once it reached the right wall, it stopped. Then turned. And moved toward the closet.

I tightened my grip on the knife. A stream of adrenaline coursed through my veins, making my skin tingle. I fought hard to keep my mind clear and focused. If the door opened, I would take them by surprise. Hammer the blade down in one, quick motion. It was all I had.

It came right up to the door. And stopped. The sound of our own breathing filled the closet. A floorboard creaked.

Every nerve inside my body screamed. *What is it doing? Why is it just standing there?* Then, a camera clicked. Through the gap under the door, a light flashed. Against all logic, all reason, it had taken a picture of the closet door.

A deep, yet childlike laughter vibrated into the closet. The camera clicked again. It knew exactly where we were, and it was playing games. It was toying with us. Max's body trembled behind me, and a soft whimper escaped from his lips.

I prepared myself. The door would open any moment. And it was up to me to save our lives.

I raised the knife so I could swing it down right as the door opened. I held my breath. I listened as the handle jiggled and began to turn. The door swung open.

I hacked the knife blindly in front of me. Officer Dan staggered backwards just in time.

""Whoa! Whoa!""

I darted my eyes around the room. Looking for it. Looking for blood. I was frantic.

""It's just me! It's just me. No one is here. I've got you. You're safe.""

""No we're not. It was just here. I heard-""

""We have multiple officers searching your home. No one is here.""

I scanned the room again. There was no camera. No creature. No obvious threat. The stress of what had just occurred began weighing down on me. I lost my sense of balance and stumbled. Officer Dan caught me by the arm. He guided me toward Max's bed. As I sat down, Max darted out from the closet and jumped onto the bed and clung onto me.

""You called me. Remember?"" Officer Dan said. ""But you didn't say anything, so we were afraid something had happened. We forced open the front door, then I heard you guys in here. Did you think he broke in?""

""I know he did. There were footsteps. And there's more pictures. Just look on the counter-""

""There are no signs of forced entry, Jenny."" Officer Dan paused and glanced over at the closet door. He ran his palms together, then approached the bed. He took a seat beside us. ""You know, sometimes, in high stress situations, our minds produce things-sounds, images, things like that-that aren't really there. It's *perfectly* normal. Given your…situation, it's possible that that's all that happened.""

""Don't talk to me like that, Dan. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I heard. You're a cop, not a therapist. Get off the bed.""

Once I'd snapped on him, Officer Dan had no more psychotherapeutic explanations for me. He stood and left us alone in the room. He left the house, in fact, but some of the other officers were kind enough to stay with us until morning. For the rest of the night, there were no more signs of the intruder.

\*\*\*

The next day, I applied for a credit card and checked us into a hotel. I also put that house on the market. A week later, someone bought it. I took the money and bought a new house in a completely different state. Even though the old one sold well under its value, I didn't care. As long as we left behind whatever was in there, we had all we needed.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,* I told myself. *Calm down, breathe. That's it.* *Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",1,1761500904.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Three days. The silence was a living entity in my apartment. The gallery was a refuge, a space I could control, but at night, the quiet pressed in. I didn't hear from Aiden. The cease-and-desist letter had done its job. The news continued its grim litany of Kingsley Global's collapse. I watched it all from a distance, a spectator to a tragedy I had narrowly escaped.



My phone buzzed, a welcome intrusion. It was Nella.



*""Sophie, you need to see this. An email just came to the gallery's general inbox.""*



I opened my laptop. The email was from an anonymous encrypted server.



***Subject: An Invitation***



***Ms. Rhodes,***



***You don't know me, but we share a common problem. Her. I have information. The kind that can end this. Meet me tonight. 10 PM. The old waterfront warehouse, pier 7. Come alone. Tell no one, especially not your brother. If you involve the police, the information disappears forever.***



***- A Friend***



My blood ran cold. It was a trap. It had to be. But the phrase *""the kind that can end this""* echoed in my mind. What if it wasn't? What if this was the break I needed?



Lucas would lock me in my apartment if he knew. The police would scare the source away. This was a decision I had to make alone.



I typed a quick, timed email to Lucas and my lawyer, *Martin Croft*, set to send at midnight. If you're reading this, I'm at pier 7. Investigate.



Then I grabbed my keys and a heavy steel flashlight from the closet. I wasn't going to be a victim. I was going as a hunter.



***POV: Aiden***



The world had shrunk to the four walls of my study. Empty coffee cups and legal briefs littered every surface. My company was in freefall. The board had turned into a den of snakes, each one trying to save their own skin. Chip was in the wind, his betrayal a festering wound.



My phone buzzed. Not a number, but a location alert. A tracking app I’d installed on Sophie’s phone during a better time, a paranoid security measure for a wife I’d often left alone. I’d never disabled it. I’d forgotten it existed.



The alert showed her location moving toward the industrial waterfront. A desolate, dangerous area at night.



A cold dread, sharper than any corporate fear, seized me. This wasn't a gallery event. This was something else.

 *Alessia.*



The cease-and-desist letter burned in my mind. Any further contact... will result in immediate legal action.



But this wasn't contact. This was… a warning. An instinct. If I was wrong, I’d face her legal wrath. If I was right…



I grabbed my jacket and car keys, moving on an impulse deeper than reason. The law could damn me later. Tonight, I wouldn't let history repeat itself.



***POV: Alessia***



The warehouse was perfect. Decaying, isolated, the air thick with the smell of salt and rust. I stood in the shadows of the second-floor gantry, watching the single door.



She came, just as I knew she would. So predictably brave. *Sophie Rhodes,* the avenging artist, clutching a pathetic flashlight like a sword.



She stepped into the pool of dim light from a single hanging bulb. *""Hello?""* Her voice was steady, but I could hear the tension in it. *""I'm here.""*



I pressed a button on a remote. The heavy warehouse door slammed shut behind her, the boom echoing through the vast space.



She spun around, a flashlight beam cutting wildly through the darkness.



*""Hello, Sophie.""* My voice, amplified by a small speaker, echoed around her. She couldn't see me.



*""What is this? What information do you have?""*



*""I have the truth,""* I said, my voice dripping with false sympathy. *""The truth about Aiden. He knew about the corporate espionage plot weeks ago. He let it happen. He needed a scapegoat for his failing company, and he chose you. The* ***'joint statement'?*** *A calculated move to make his story more believable. He's been playing you from the start.""*



I could see her body tense, a silhouette of doubt and anger. The lie was perfect because it fed the narrative she was already primed to believe—that he was capable of any cruelty.



*""Why are you telling me this?""* she called out.



*""Because he needs to pay,""* I hissed, letting real venom into my voice. *""And you're going to help me. You're going to testify that he conspired with you to fabricate the scandal, to manipulate the stock price. You'll be the star witness in his destruction.""*



She was silent, processing the monstrous proposal.



This was the gambit. Turn her. Use her justified anger to become the instrument of his ruin. It was the most elegant form of revenge.



***POV: Sophie***



His voice echoed around me, a bodiless serpent hissing lies. **He knew. He chose you.** The words found every crack in my armor, every lingering doubt.



But then I saw it. A flicker of movement on the metal gantry above. A shadow detaching itself from the deeper shadows.



***Alessia.***



And in that moment, the entire house of cards collapsed. This wasn't a source. This was a puppet master, trying to pull my strings.



*""You're lying,""* I said, my voice louder, clearer now. *""You always lie. This isn't about me testifying against him. This is about you wanting to own what's left of him. You can't stand that even broken, he'll never be yours.""*



The silence from the speaker was deafening. I had struck a nerve.



Then, a new sound. A scrape at the door. Before I could react, a side door I hadn't seen flew open.



Aiden stood there, silhouetted against the night sky, his chest heaving.



*""Alessia!""* he roared, his voice raw with a fury that shook the very foundations of the warehouse.



It was a trap. But he had walked into it too.



***POV: Alessia***



Perfect. This was better than I could have planned.



He came. The noble fool. He couldn't help himself.



Now they were both here. In my arena.



I clicked off the speaker and drew the small, sleek pistol from my coat pocket. It wasn't about killing. It was about theater. About forcing a final, irreversible choice.



I stepped into the light of the gantry, looking down at them both.



*""How romantic,""* I said, my voice no longer amplified, but cutting through the silence. *""The traitor and the fool. Together again.""*



I raised the gun, not at him, but at her.



*""Time to choose, Aiden. One last time. Your company, or her life?""*

  Hey everyone! 👋

  I just released **v2.0.0** of Skill Seekers - a major update that adds GitHub repository scraping and multi-source integration!

  ## 🚀 What's New in v2.0.0

  ### GitHub Repository Scraping
  You can now generate AI skills directly from GitHub repositories:
  - **AST code analysis** for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go
  - **Extracts complete API reference** - functions, classes, methods with full signatures
  - **Repository metadata** - README, file tree, language stats, stars/forks
  - **Issues & PRs tracking** - Automatically includes open/closed issues with labels

  ### Multi-Source Integration (This is the game-changer!)
  Combine **documentation + GitHub repo + PDFs** into a single unified skill:

  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""react_complete"",
    ""sources"": [
      {""type"": ""documentation"", ""base_url"": ""https://react.dev/""},
      {""type"": ""github"", ""repo"": ""facebook/react""}
    ]
  }
  ```

  Conflict Detection 🔍

  Here's where it gets interesting - the tool compares documentation against actual code:

  - ""Docs say X, but code does Y"" - Finds mismatches between documentation and implementation
  - Missing APIs - Functions documented but not in code
  - Undocumented APIs - Functions in code but not in docs
  - Parameter mismatches - Different signatures between docs and code

  Plus, it uses GitHub metadata to provide context:
  - ""Documentation says function takes 2 parameters, but code has 3""
  - ""This API is marked deprecated in code comments but docs don't mention it""
  - ""There are 5 open issues about this function behaving differently than documented""

  Example Output:

  ⚠️ Conflict detected in useEffect():
  - Docs: ""Takes 2 parameters (effect, dependencies)""
  - Code: Actually takes 2-3 parameters (effect, dependencies, debugValue?)
  - Related: Issue #1234 ""useEffect debug parameter undocumented""

  Previous Major Updates (Now Combined!)

  All these features work together:

  ⚡ v1.3.0 - Performance

  - 3x faster scraping with async support
  - Parallel requests for massive docs
  - No page limits - scrape 10K-40K+ pages

  📄 v1.2.0 - PDF Support

  - Extract text + code from PDFs
  - Image extraction with OCR
  - Multi-column detection

  Now you can combine all three: Scrape official docs + GitHub repo + PDF tutorials into one comprehensive AI skill!

1ogqz7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1ogqz7x/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son’s Halloween candy. Someone’s been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I… don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just…you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.* ""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my *Maxwell House* coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again. *Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.* *You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

My mind struggled to process what I was seeing. There was no way an intruder could have entered the house and taken a picture with an officer standing right there.

I flipped to the next one.

This one was of me in my bedroom, tucking my son into bed. And the way it was shot looked like something only possible in a dream. It was captured from a bird's-eye view, directly above our heads. A blade from the ceiling fan even cut into the edge of the frame. Because it was taken so close to the light, the shot was overexposed, which put a hazy kind of filter over it. This defied all logic.

To get that picture, whoever or \_what\_ever took it would have to have been suspended from the ceiling. They would have to have manipulated themselves into an impossible angle. All without me or Max knowing.

My hands were trembling now. The room was beginning to spin. Terrified now, I flipped to the final picture.

It was of me, my back facing the camera, standing in my kitchen. I was looking down. Studying something in my hands. Just like I was now, at this very moment. The shot was taken so close behind me, whatever had taken it could have reached out and touched me.

I needed to get Max out of the house. Right now.

*Click.*

Something snapped, directly behind my head. Then the room was quiet again. My mind took a moment to register what it even was. But slowly, a sick realization slithered up from the pit of my stomach.

What I had just heard was the shutter of a Polaroid camera.

The camera's inner mechanisms hummed as it worked to print out the picture. I froze. I stopped breathing. In a desperate attempt, I tried reasoning with the intruder.

""What do you want from me?"" I cried. I listened for a response, still holding the pictures in my trembling fingers. There was no reply.

The picture finished printing, and whatever was behind me stood perfectly still. Several seconds ticked by. Was it waiting for *me* to turn around?

Across the counter, against the back wall was a block of kitchen knives. I wished they were closer. But they were way out of reach. Depending on what happened next, maybe I could get to them. But for now, I would have to turn and face whatever was behind me, head on.

One slow inch at a time, I turned my head, my heart pounding inside my chest. I expected to be stabbed or choked or grabbed at any second. I turned a little bit further, then shot a glance back.

The kitchen was empty.

I exhaled-but a new fear, much greater than before, exploded inside me. *It's going to get Max.*

I dropped the pictures and shot around the counter and ripped out the biggest knife from the block. Then I dug out my phone and hit ""call"" on Officer Dan's contact.

*Call failed.*

I tapped the screen several more times.

*Call failed. Call failed. Call failed.* I slammed it on the counter in a fit of anger. Of all the times for my phone to not work, of course it would be now. I had no other option. I'd have to run upstairs and get Max by myself.

I moved through the downstairs with the knife aimed in front of me. I checked around every corner and every piece of furniture I passed. I sprinted up the stairs, then through the upstairs hallway, toward my bedroom.

I pushed the bedroom door open slowly, horrified that it had already beaten me there. Thankfully, Max was still under the covers, safe and sound. I peeled the blanket off him and scooped him up in my arms.

""Mommy?"" he said, rubbing his eyes.

""Shhh. We have to go. Stay quiet."" He wrapped his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder.

I crept over to the door and peeked into the hallway. Empty.

I carried Max down the hall, toward the stairs. If we could just make it out the front door, I'd run straight to the neighbors and call the cops from there. Just a short trip down the stairs and through the living room. We could do it.

When we neared the steps, I heard the worst noise imaginable. Footsteps pounding up the stairs.

My mind entered into fight or flight mode. Should I attack? Give Max a chance to run? No-I can't leave him. He'd never get away.

I backed up. To my right was my son's bedroom. I ducked inside and rushed to the closet. I inched open the door as quietly as I could, but still, it squealed on its hinges. We slid inside. There was barely enough space for both of us. I clicked the door shut and stood in front of Max, using my body as a shield.

""Mommy, what are we doing?""

I turned and cupped a hand over his mouth. ""Not. Another. Word.""

We listened. With each passing second, the footsteps grew closer, until they arrived at the bedroom door. Then they slowed to a nice and easy stroll and entered the room. Floorboards creaked under a shifting weight. Something paced across the room, from left to right, like it was searching for us. Once it reached the right wall, it stopped. Then turned. And moved toward the closet.

I tightened my grip on the knife. A stream of adrenaline coursed through my veins, making my skin tingle. I fought hard to keep my mind clear and focused. If the door opened, I would take them by surprise. Hammer the blade down in one, quick motion. It was all I had.

It came right up to the door. And stopped. The sound of our own breathing filled the closet. A floorboard creaked.

Every nerve inside my body screamed. *What is it doing? Why is it just standing there?* Then, a camera clicked. Through the gap under the door, a light flashed. Against all logic, all reason, it had taken a picture of the closet door.

A deep, yet childlike laughter vibrated into the closet. The camera clicked again. It knew exactly where we were, and it was playing games. It was toying with us. Max's body trembled behind me, and a soft whimper escaped from his lips.

I prepared myself. The door would open any moment. And it was up to me to save our lives.

I raised the knife so I could swing it down right as the door opened. I held my breath. I listened as the handle jiggled and began to turn. The door swung open.

I hacked the knife blindly in front of me. Officer Dan staggered backwards just in time.

""Whoa! Whoa!""

I darted my eyes around the room. Looking for it. Looking for blood. I was frantic.

""It's just me! It's just me. No one is here. I've got you. You're safe.""

""No we're not. It was just here. I heard-""

""We have multiple officers searching your home. No one is here.""

I scanned the room again. There was no camera. No creature. No obvious threat. The stress of what had just occurred began weighing down on me. I lost my sense of balance and stumbled. Officer Dan caught me by the arm. He guided me toward Max's bed. As I sat down, Max darted out from the closet and jumped onto the bed and clung onto me.

""You called me. Remember?"" Officer Dan said. ""But you didn't say anything, so we were afraid something had happened. We forced open the front door, then I heard you guys in here. Did you think he broke in?""

""I know he did. There were footsteps. And there's more pictures. Just look on the counter-""

""There are no signs of forced entry, Jenny."" Officer Dan paused and glanced over at the closet door. He ran his palms together, then approached the bed. He took a seat beside us. ""You know, sometimes, in high stress situations, our minds produce things-sounds, images, things like that-that aren't really there. It's *perfectly* normal. Given your…situation, it's possible that that's all that happened.""

""Don't talk to me like that, Dan. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I heard. You're a cop, not a therapist. Get off the bed.""

Once I'd snapped on him, Officer Dan had no more psychotherapeutic explanations for me. He stood and left us alone in the room. He left the house, in fact, but some of the other officers were kind enough to stay with us until morning. For the rest of the night, there were no more signs of the intruder.

\*\*\*

The next day, I applied for a credit card and checked us into a hotel. I also put that house on the market. A week later, someone bought it. I took the money and bought a new house in a completely different state. Even though the old one sold well under its value, I didn't care. As long as we left behind whatever was in there, we had all we needed.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,* I told myself. *Calm down, breathe. That's it.* *Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",1,1761500860.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False

1ogqyj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1ogqyj3/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son’s Halloween candy. Someone’s been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I… don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just…you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.* ""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my *Maxwell House* coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again. *Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.* *You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,* I told myself. *Calm down, breathe. That's it.* *Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",2,1761500816.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

1. Meditation (morning & evening meditation from Joe Dispenza, sometimes I'll throw in some more advanced ones, e.g. abundance meditation)
2. 6-time book practice, basically every day for 6 times regularly you jot down 3 things:
- an action where you helped others with money (e.g. treating friends coffee, donating, paying for a meal, tip, etc.)
- an action where you did not so well (e.g. got frustrated, being rude to someone, etc.)
- a future action that you plan to act in the next few hours that could plant a good seed (e.g. compliment someone)
I do this 6 time book every 2 to 3 hours every day 

Results:
150% growth in my business revenue within 4 months of time

My main challenge is actually keeping my habits, as I make more money I get busier and I sometimes slipped with the habits. But during the last 4 years, almost every time I pick up these ""manifestation"" method, my biz would make a good turn again.

Started September 22nd very mildly as spots. Progressed until I recognized it as “hives”. I went on a light steroid from urgent care and got an allergist referral from my primary (first appointment I could get was November 10 😥). Meanwhile, I seemed to have some success minimizing them by way paring down what I was eating. I thought dairy was on my okay list since I’d been drinking coffee with creamer, but when I ate cheese I had an explosive reaction. What had become a few spots within 45 minutes was huge hives and these swollen hives that felt like someone had put balls under my skin! I stopped all dairy (as of Friday night). I ended up at urgent care Saturday tho bc I woke up with my lips swollen. They prescribed me another go of steroids, this time straight prednisone for ten days. Things seemed to be cooling down and I woke up with almost no hives - but throughout today they have kept popping up. They’re small extremely itchy spots this time, some flat some a but swollen. All over my body, when it seemed to be a random part of my body up until now (like torso, or lower legs,). I haven’t eaten any dairy, but I did eat other foods that were not what I’d been eating.  

If it was the dairy could I still be seeing a reaction from that one exposure? 

I know it may not be food at all, I’m just trying anything I can. I’ve also been taking Allegra and Zyrtec everyday ",1,1761500682.0,urticaria,1,1.0,False
1ogqw2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ElliotPryce/comments/1ogqw2t/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son’s Halloween candy. Someone’s been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I… don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just…you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.* ""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my *Maxwell House* coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again. *Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.* *You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

My mind struggled to process what I was seeing. There was no way an intruder could have entered the house and taken a picture with an officer standing right there.

I flipped to the next one.

This one was of me in my bedroom, tucking my son into bed. And the way it was shot looked like something only possible in a dream. It was captured from a bird's-eye view, directly above our heads. A blade from the ceiling fan even cut into the edge of the frame. Because it was taken so close to the light, the shot was overexposed, which put a hazy kind of filter over it. This defied all logic.

To get that picture, whoever or \_what\_ever took it would have to have been suspended from the ceiling. They would have to have manipulated themselves into an impossible angle. All without me or Max knowing.

My hands were trembling now. The room was beginning to spin. Terrified now, I flipped to the final picture.

It was of me, my back facing the camera, standing in my kitchen. I was looking down. Studying something in my hands. Just like I was now, at this very moment. The shot was taken so close behind me, whatever had taken it could have reached out and touched me.

I needed to get Max out of the house. Right now.

*Click.*

Something snapped, directly behind my head. Then the room was quiet again. My mind took a moment to register what it even was. But slowly, a sick realization slithered up from the pit of my stomach.

What I had just heard was the shutter of a Polaroid camera.

The camera's inner mechanisms hummed as it worked to print out the picture. I froze. I stopped breathing. In a desperate attempt, I tried reasoning with the intruder.

""What do you want from me?"" I cried. I listened for a response, still holding the pictures in my trembling fingers. There was no reply.

The picture finished printing, and whatever was behind me stood perfectly still. Several seconds ticked by. Was it waiting for *me* to turn around?

Across the counter, against the back wall was a block of kitchen knives. I wished they were closer. But they were way out of reach. Depending on what happened next, maybe I could get to them. But for now, I would have to turn and face whatever was behind me, head on.

One slow inch at a time, I turned my head, my heart pounding inside my chest. I expected to be stabbed or choked or grabbed at any second. I turned a little bit further, then shot a glance back.

The kitchen was empty.

I exhaled-but a new fear, much greater than before, exploded inside me. *It's going to get Max.*

I dropped the pictures and shot around the counter and ripped out the biggest knife from the block. Then I dug out my phone and hit ""call"" on Officer Dan's contact.

*Call failed.*

I tapped the screen several more times.

*Call failed. Call failed. Call failed.* I slammed it on the counter in a fit of anger. Of all the times for my phone to not work, of course it would be now. I had no other option. I'd have to run upstairs and get Max by myself.

I moved through the downstairs with the knife aimed in front of me. I checked around every corner and every piece of furniture I passed. I sprinted up the stairs, then through the upstairs hallway, toward my bedroom.

I pushed the bedroom door open slowly, horrified that it had already beaten me there. Thankfully, Max was still under the covers, safe and sound. I peeled the blanket off him and scooped him up in my arms.

""Mommy?"" he said, rubbing his eyes.

""Shhh. We have to go. Stay quiet."" He wrapped his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder.

I crept over to the door and peeked into the hallway. Empty.

I carried Max down the hall, toward the stairs. If we could just make it out the front door, I'd run straight to the neighbors and call the cops from there. Just a short trip down the stairs and through the living room. We could do it.

When we neared the steps, I heard the worst noise imaginable. Footsteps pounding up the stairs.

My mind entered into fight or flight mode. Should I attack? Give Max a chance to run? No-I can't leave him. He'd never get away.

I backed up. To my right was my son's bedroom. I ducked inside and rushed to the closet. I inched open the door as quietly as I could, but still, it squealed on its hinges. We slid inside. There was barely enough space for both of us. I clicked the door shut and stood in front of Max, using my body as a shield.

""Mommy, what are we doing?""

I turned and cupped a hand over his mouth. ""Not. Another. Word.""

We listened. With each passing second, the footsteps grew closer, until they arrived at the bedroom door. Then they slowed to a nice and easy stroll and entered the room. Floorboards creaked under a shifting weight. Something paced across the room, from left to right, like it was searching for us. Once it reached the right wall, it stopped. Then turned. And moved toward the closet.

I tightened my grip on the knife. A stream of adrenaline coursed through my veins, making my skin tingle. I fought hard to keep my mind clear and focused. If the door opened, I would take them by surprise. Hammer the blade down in one, quick motion. It was all I had.

It came right up to the door. And stopped. The sound of our own breathing filled the closet. A floorboard creaked.

Every nerve inside my body screamed. *What is it doing? Why is it just standing there?* Then, a camera clicked. Through the gap under the door, a light flashed. Against all logic, all reason, it had taken a picture of the closet door.

A deep, yet childlike laughter vibrated into the closet. The camera clicked again. It knew exactly where we were, and it was playing games. It was toying with us. Max's body trembled behind me, and a soft whimper escaped from his lips.

I prepared myself. The door would open any moment. And it was up to me to save our lives.

I raised the knife so I could swing it down right as the door opened. I held my breath. I listened as the handle jiggled and began to turn. The door swung open.

I hacked the knife blindly in front of me. Officer Dan staggered backwards just in time.

""Whoa! Whoa!""

I darted my eyes around the room. Looking for it. Looking for blood. I was frantic.

""It's just me! It's just me. No one is here. I've got you. You're safe.""

""No we're not. It was just here. I heard-""

""We have multiple officers searching your home. No one is here.""

I scanned the room again. There was no camera. No creature. No obvious threat. The stress of what had just occurred began weighing down on me. I lost my sense of balance and stumbled. Officer Dan caught me by the arm. He guided me toward Max's bed. As I sat down, Max darted out from the closet and jumped onto the bed and clung onto me.

""You called me. Remember?"" Officer Dan said. ""But you didn't say anything, so we were afraid something had happened. We forced open the front door, then I heard you guys in here. Did you think he broke in?""

""I know he did. There were footsteps. And there's more pictures. Just look on the counter-""

""There are no signs of forced entry, Jenny."" Officer Dan paused and glanced over at the closet door. He ran his palms together, then approached the bed. He took a seat beside us. ""You know, sometimes, in high stress situations, our minds produce things-sounds, images, things like that-that aren't really there. It's *perfectly* normal. Given your…situation, it's possible that that's all that happened.""

""Don't talk to me like that, Dan. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I heard. You're a cop, not a therapist. Get off the bed.""

Once I'd snapped on him, Officer Dan had no more psychotherapeutic explanations for me. He stood and left us alone in the room. He left the house, in fact, but some of the other officers were kind enough to stay with us until morning. For the rest of the night, there were no more signs of the intruder.

\*\*\*

The next day, I applied for a credit card and checked us into a hotel. I also put that house on the market. A week later, someone bought it. I took the money and bought a new house in a completely different state. Even though the old one sold well under its value, I didn't care. As long as we left behind whatever was in there, we had all we needed.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,* I told myself. *Calm down, breathe. That's it.* *Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",2,1761500658.0,u_ElliotPryce,0,1.0,False

I was eight years old the first time Mama scraped the last bit of grease from the coffee can.
It sat on the stove like a holy relic — dented, blackened, and precious as gold. Every meal we had worth remembering came from that can. Bacon grease on biscuits, a spoonful to fry up a potato, a dab to stretch beans past their worth. We guarded it like a secret, but shared it all the same.

Our farm lay on the red clay outside Watonga, Oklahoma where the wind never quite stopped. The Great Depression didn’t hit us so much as settle in beside us, like an unwelcome guest who never left. But life went on. We had our chores, our stories, our grease, and our grit.

Mama always said, “You don’t measure wealth by what you keep, but by what you give when you’ve got nothing left.”

That old coffee can was proof of that.
We’d have folks wander up the road — worn men with their hats in hand, women with babies swaddled in flour sacks. They’d ask if we had a corner of the barn to sleep in or a biscuit to spare. And somehow, no matter how lean things got, Mama found enough to fry.

She’d take a pinch of cornmeal, a bit of flour, maybe an onion if the garden was kind that week. Then came the grease — that shimmering bit of mercy — and suddenly it smelled like heaven had stopped by for supper. We’d eat together, strangers and kin alike, around a rickety table that wobbled like the world itself.

Sometimes, one of the men would fix a hinge or mend a fence before heading on his way. Others left quietly before dawn, leaving a “thank you” carved into a fencepost or a wildflower tucked in the screen door.

I didn’t understand it then — the weight of generosity in hard times. But now, a hundred years gone by and my hands as thin as the dust we once breathed, I see that coffee can for what it was: the heart of it all.

It wasn’t the grease itself, but what it represented — the stubborn joy of flavor, the kindness that kept us human. In those leanest years, when the sky cracked and the fields turned to powder, we learned that love wasn’t something grand or spoken loud. It was something you saved, drop by drop, and shared when someone else needed a taste of hope.

So if I leave anything behind, let it be this:
Find your own coffee can. Fill it with whatever small grace life gives you.
And when someone knocks on your door — hungry, lost, or lonely — open it wide.
Because sometimes, all the world needs to get by is a spoonful of grease and a little bit of heart.

And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post (from my other account I cannot access)

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.",1,1761500147.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Okay, look... I struggle. Lmao , we all know what brains we have.With ADHD in the mix, even basic routines can feel like climbing mount everest in sandals. Buying stuff doesn’t fix that, obviously, but I’ve learned that a few intentional splurges can make my life a little easier.

For me, the magic areas are hygiene, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Those are the chaos zones where a small upgrade actually makes a long-term difference.

So, picture this: one day, I decided to splurge on a fancy lotion and body oil duo. I’d seen it everywhere online and was hoping it could help my eczema. It cost like five times what I’d normally spend.

For about a week, I was on it. Lotion every day, like clockwork. Then… ADHD happened. Out of sight, out of mind, you know the drill. Fast-forward three days after forgetting, and I glance down expecting to see my usual flaky situation but low and fucking behold… I wasn’t that ashy.

The combo actually worked. Normally, I’m dry within eight hours of moisturizing, but this time? Three days later and my skin just looked a little thirsty, not full-on desert mode. That tiny success gave me a dopamine hit so strong I swear I heard level-up music.

I went on a little self-care spree after that, nicer shower gels, better-smelling stuff, anything that made hygiene feel like something to look forward to instead of another task I’ll definitely forget halfway through.

And look, I still don’t lotion every day. But I do it more often, and that’s huge for me. Because now, every time I reach for that lotion and oil combo, I know it’s worth the effort. It’ll keep me soft for days, which means missing a day (or two or three) doesn’t feel like starting from scratch. That tiny bit of forgiveness built into the routine? Life-changing.

Then I started applying that same principle to my space. I bought a carpet I love lookong at so now I actually keep my floor clear (ish). I styled my shelves so they look pretty enough, which somehow helps me not pile stuff on them. I even turned my giant mirror into a vanity, and now I want to sit there and do my makeup. It’s not pristine, but it’s functional and cozy — my kind of “organized.”

And the tea corner. Oh, the tea corner. I got a cute stand, filled it with bougie loose-leaf tea, and added a pretty kettle. It’s my little ADHD-friendly ritual. simple, rewarding, and visually satisfying enough to make me actually maintain it. “Neat” might be a stretch, but it’s neat enough.

My latest upgrade? An automatic milk frother. I used to waste milk constantly, because remembering to use it before it expired? Not happening. But this thing changed the game. I’ve gone through two whole gallons since buying. That, for me, is basically a world record. It’s tied into my coffee-and-tea habit, so it gets used (and, shockingly, cleaned) almost every day.

Now, I’ve turned sale-hunting into a dopamine sport. I’ll stalk a product online for weeks until it drops in price, then pounce. It scratches the impulsive itch without blowing my budget. I still spend more than I should.  But at least now it’s on things that make my daily chaos slightly more manageable, instead of Doordash and joints.

And honestly, I can feel the shift. When I get the urge to impulse-buy, I pause. Like, yeah, I could Doordash McDonald’s right now… but what I really want is that electric scrubber thing so I can clean my tub while my conditioner sets. Or that cute doormat I found online because apparently, I care about keeping my carpet clean now. Who even am I?

When I’m out shopping, I’ve started price-checking online before buying. Baby steps toward being financially literate, right? It’s progress, slow, uneven, sometimes messy progress, but real nonetheless.

So no, buying stuff doesn’t magically fix ADHD. But sometimes, the right little luxury takes a routine that feels impossible and turns it into something just manageable enough to keep going. And in my world, that’s a pretty big win.",3,1761499983.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

It wasn’t the grease itself, but what it represented — the stubborn joy of flavor, the kindness that kept us human. In those leanest years, when the sky cracked and the fields turned to powder, we learned that love wasn’t something grand or spoken loud. It was something you saved, drop by drop, and shared when someone else needed a taste of hope.

So if I leave anything behind, let it be this:
Find your own coffee can. Fill it with whatever small grace life gives you.
And when someone knocks on your door — hungry, lost, or lonely — open it wide.
Because sometimes, all the world needs to get by is a spoonful of grease and a little bit of heart.",1,1761499767.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I’m Bree 🌿 I’ve worked in the coffee industry for about 10 years. When I’m not working, I’m usually hiking, writing, car camping in my Subaru <3, or planning my next adventure. I love collecting rocks, listening to music (Chappell Roan, Ethel Cain, Jeff Buckley, etc.), and expanding my meme collection. I also speak Spanish!

I live with bipolar disorder so I feel things very deeply. I’m a passionate person which often turns into impulsive new hobbies like calligraphy, drawing, impromptu trips, or planning spontaneous international trips LOL. These past months I’ve stepped back from a lot of people to focus on my mental health but I realllly miss connecting and sharing with others.

A few interests are psychology, astrology, spirituality, cooking, and learning new things! I’m not religious, but I love learning about different belief systems and how people find meaning in them.

More recently, I ordered an Odyssey Argos, which should be shipping soon.

After using a Barista Pro and with this new machine coming in, I'm worried that I've been moving towards fancier machines and better coffee instead of my goal of simplifying workflow. My Robot is not fun to pull back to back shots with, I have to manage my water, and I have to measure every basket because my grinder is not timed. Additionally, when switching beans, it's a huge pain in the ass to have to redo a shot or two mid morning with my setup.

I'm looking for suggestions about machines, grinders, or some combination that will achieve the same footprint (I'm willing to place a machine on a towel and slide it under cabinets) and similar quality coffee, ideally with only light maintenance, other than the occasional descale. Budget is $5000.

I love my Sculptor's footprint and retention, but I find it annoying that it's not timed and can't load a hopper because it's ""supposed"" to be loaded hot. I also find static to be a problem if using any cup that isn't the one that comes with it, which means I have to have an extra cup, if I want to measure two batches of beans at the same time.

I love the Robot's quality of coffee and super easy maintenance, but I dislike the attention of using a lever. I'm hoping the Odyssey Argos will resolve this with the spring lever, but I'm also worried that water management and scale buildup in the machine will be obnoxious. I'm not planning to buy a new machine until I've tried the Argos for a month, but I have a feeling I'm going to be selling it.

What upgrades should I aim for over the next couple of years that would give me great espresso with a faster and simpler workflow, with similar footprint to the current setup?",1,1761499693.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I don't have a car so I walked nearly 2 miles to the coffee shop. He said he'd be there within 15 minutes and he was texting me right up until I got 2 blocks away from the shop.

1ogqd9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ogqd9w/how_do_i_talk_to_my_mom_about_it_being_a_racist/,How do I talk to my mom about it being a racist when she doesn’t believe she is one?,"I (26F) am married to my husband (almost 27m). We are in an interracial relationship, and have been together for almost 10 years, 3 married this next February. He is amazing and a great human being. My parents say they like him, it seems fine. 

Both of my parents have always been very racist, although my dad is more quiet about it. He would say things like “avoid people who are x race” or “people who are y race are terrible because (insert something probably about their religion.” He has toned down a lot and showed growth over the years, and has never said anything to anyone outside of our family or made a scene. He is a textbook narcissist and I honestly don’t have it in me to fight that battle. 

My mom is a whole other issue, and really a bigger issue because it impacts more people directly. She says she loves other people, and talks like she is not a racist, but then does the most out of pocket bat shit crazy things I have ever seen. For example, once we were getting coffee in a drive through and she heard two people speaking a different language and (mind you, while her window was still down) starts mocking their language by going “bleher bleher bleher”. I don’t know how to describe it. She makes a face when she does it like she thinks she is being funny, turning to the nearest person (this time me) for validation. I immediately told her that her behavior was egregious and extremely offensive (and also where we live that’s the kind of thing you get SHOT for to make it hit home), and she goes “I just think the language is so beautiful. It’s a compliment.” LADY WHAT. 

My husband is Hispanic, and many family members only speak Spanish. I am learning, but still have some work to do. But my mom - She has always inserted herself of faked speaking Spanish, like above. Sometimes she will just speak louder and in a childish way to those who can’t understand her thick southern accent. She has told me she thinks my mother in law is “immature” because of the way she speaks, which is completely untrue as she is incredibly smart and kind. She just thinks she is dumb because she doesn’t speak English, which is something I have recently learned happens too often. 

Regardless, I have apologized for this behavior many times and have told her to stop. They just ignore it and continue to talk over her. It is like she tries to be the center of attention during their conversation. I do not choose to invite her to these events, they are just the kind of people that love no matter what. 

Pivot to last night, to celebrate my husband’s birthday. She is doing her annoying behaviors. My dad looks visibly embarrassed. The usual. Then, they play this Mexican version of the happy birthday song. They were all signing it and my father in law was talking about some of the history behind it and the clown that sings it, all very interesting. They love to share their culture and I love to learn it. All fine and dandy until it gets to a portion of the song where they are doing the gritos. For those who are not aware, a grito is a shout to express a strong emotion, usually during an instrumental part of the song. SHE STARTS MOCKING THAT. I wanted to melt into the floor. My dad visibly shifting in his seat. Side eye from family and friends. She continued for far too long. She stops, everyone moves on. 

I am humiliated that she did that. I have told her what she does makes everyone uncomfortable. I have told her to stop, not just related to my husband’s side of the family but in general. To me, it appears to be attention seeking behavior. Age is not an excuse, upbringing is not an excuse! Especially because I was brought up and told to think certain ways about different races from me, and all it took was to sit back and truly form my own opinion. People are fully capable of opening their eyes and learning and they choose not to. 

I talked to my husband about it, he said it was fine and they were honestly just making fun of her. They might be fine with it, but I am not. I am pissed.

He reluctantly got up and opened the curtains — life outside was ringing and bursting with light, while inside his not-so-humble apartment the day was only beginning.

In the kitchen, he overheard a loud quarrel: apparently, the neighbor’s son didn’t want to go to school today and threw a tantrum.
“Loud, nasty children,” the broker thought. “And their parents are no better. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”

Gathering his things, the broker set off on his usual Thursday marathon: park, café, pier, the city’s main avenue — and then home.

Entering the café, the smell of freshly brewed coffee hit his nose.
Approaching the counter, he gave the pretty barista his usual order:
“Flat white on oat milk, no sugar. A doppio. And a chocolate fondant — without ice cream,” he said coldly.

With a trace of fear and distrust, she took the order.

His favorite table overlooking French Avenue was occupied by a couple in love. On their table sat the cheapest coffee — and a single slice of cheesecake to share.
“Pathetic poor fools, why even come here?” he muttered irritably.

“Excuse me?” said the barista cautiously. “Here’s your order.”

The broker took his tray — a task beneath him — and sat near the counter.
The weather forecast on the radio was replaced by jazz, interrupting his meal (his villainy?).
“How awful this jazz is!” he burst out.

With milk on his upper lip like a child, he looked at the barista, whose face clearly showed a suppressed smile.
She switched the station to classical music, thinking, “People like him usually prefer men in powdered wigs.”

Having calmed down and ready to enjoy his breakfast, the broker suddenly felt someone’s eyes on him.
Looking around, he saw it was the same couple who’d taken his “royal” seat.
“That’s it! I’ll hit them! They’ll be licking dust off the floor!” he fumed.

But everyone was just looking at him, their smiles filled with pity rather than mockery.

Leaving his doppio unfinished, and without even opening his laptop to check the market, he walked out.

The broker headed for the pier, planning to spend the rest of the day there.
He admired the incoming waves for a long time — but work never waits.
Opening his laptop, he began reading the latest news — and suddenly froze.

The market had crashed while he was in the café, after a statement about 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.
“How much have I lost?!” he cried, heart tearing with pain.
Indeed, his fortune had dropped drastically.

He needed a walk. The neighborhood was safe — nothing ever got stolen here.
And if it did, he’d simply buy a new one.

As he walked, his mind filled with thoughts of resentment, hatred for everything that was, is, and will be.
“Everyone — kings and beggars, saints and sinners — all of them are guilty before me. Their worthless lives shaped today, and no one can convince me otherwise!”

Then, a familiar face appeared a few meters ahead.

“Oh, Julien! Long time no see!” an old friend exclaimed.
“Hey, buddy,” said our pessimist.
“How are you?”
“Fine. You?”
“Good. How’s work?”
“…Fine… Yours?”
“Great! My wife and I are going on vacation soon — finally making it happen.”
“That’s wonderful,” the broker said with quiet envy but sincere pride. “Have fun. All the best.”
“Thanks, you too, Jul.”

Crossing the street, broker Julien added to his self-centered thoughts:
“Not all of them… not all are guilty. Most of them really are… good?”

I'm a huge sucker for checking out anything cute or aesthetically pleasing

I like getting to know folks and just chatting over coffee ☕

1ogq36e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ogq36e/battle_of_the_sub100_gooseneck_kettles/,Battle of the sub-$100 gooseneck kettles,"My kettle recently went to the great coffee shop in the sky, so it was time to find a new kettle. I tend to look for value over the best of everything, so I read a few posts on different kettles in r/pourover and r/coffee, then read Amazon reviews, then purchased a kettle. It wasn't great, so I tried the next recommendation. Then I repeated that one more time.

Since guidance in these subs varies from ""Just buy the Fellow Stagg EKG"" to ""Don't bother spending any money on a kettle, invest it in a grinder"", I figured I'd share my findings, in case it helps the next person looking.

Here were my criteria, roughly in order of importance (I bold the shorthand terms to be used later):

* Only metal or glass in contact with water/**No plastic**
* **Stability**/Perceived safety
* **Volume** (>=1L to handle French Press in addition to pour overs)
* **Aesthetics**, as this will sit on my counter and I will constantly see it
* **Pourability**, or the ease in pouring water in a controlled manner at desired speed
* Ease of getting to desired **temperature**
* User experience (**UX**)
* **Cost**

I scored each on a scale of 1-5, with explanations to allow you to recalibrate for your personal preference.

Given that, here are the 3 sub-$100 gooseneck kettles purchased, per the recommendations of Reddit:

* Cocinare FLOW B9
* Cuisinart GK-1
* Greater Goods Gooseneck

Here's the breakdown:

**Cocinare FLOW B9**

* **No plastic**: 4 - only looked like metal inside, although cap was plastic.
* **Stability**: 1 - Kettle rocked on base, with or without water.
* **Volume**: 4 - 0.9L
* **Aesthetics**: 3 - Cheap plastic base, which also takes up a lot of room; Felt cheap, but at least was all black
* **Pourability**: 1 - Water comes flying out of this kettle. Very hard to control speed. My non-gooseneck kettle was easier to control water flow.
* **Temperature:** 3 - Temp starts at 194 every time. Getting to temp wasn't noticeably fast or slow.
* **UX**: 3 - While you can have 1 degree precision, it can be a little onerous to get to the temp you want with +/- buttons.
* **Cost:** 4 - One color seems to always be on sale for \~$60, otherwise \~$80.

Overall: 3 - It would work, but it feels cheap and is a bit frustrating to use.

**Cuisinart GK-1**

* **No plastic**: 2 - only looked like metal inside, although cap was plastic; *smelled of burning plastic every time water came to temp*
* **Stability**: 5 - Kettle sat firm.
* **Volume**: 5 - 1L
* **Aesthetics**: 4 - Looked fine, although took up a lot of room
* **Pourability**: 5 - GREAT control. Can pour fast or slow very easily.
* **Temperature:** 3 - Temp starts at 205. Only +/- 5 degree buttons. Getting to temp wasn't noticeably fast or slow.
* **UX**: 1 - The beeping could drive me to the insane asylum. Cuisinart and Redditors have said there is a way to turn it off. The methods they gave did not work on my unit.
* **Cost: 3** \- \~$80, down from $120.

Overall: 2 - I was hopeful when opening the box, then burning plastic & incessant loud beeping damned this one of out contention.

**Greater Goods Gooseneck**

* **No plastic**: 4 - only looked like metal inside, although cap was plastic
* **Stability**: 4 - Kettle sits firm with water, otherwise there is wobble on base.
* **Volume**: 5 - 1L
* **Aesthetics**: 5 - Simple, metal, and quite attractive. Took up the least space of all 3 units and only had one knob.
* **Pourability**: 3.5 - Consistently slow. Allows for good control for a pour over, but a bit annoying for filling a french press. Gave half a point for a handle with a thumb rest that makes pouring pretty pleasant.
* **Temperature:** 4 - Temp starts at 212. Knob makes it super quick to get to desired number. Heats faster than others, despite same wattage as Cuisinart and lower wattage than B9. The only thing that would make this a 5 is if the unit remembered my last temp, even if unplugged.
* **UX**: 4.5 - There's a little bit of a learning curve to figure out how to turn on hold (only 10 or 60 min options) and turn off beeping, but it's possible! LCD on knob is a little old school looking, but I feel they made the right tradeoffs for keeping this usable and simple.
* **Cost: 3** \- \~$65

Overall: 4.5 - This unit looked small and too simple, so I expected to be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised. The only real gripes I have are that I wish I could pour faster for french press and that the unit remembered my last temperature even after turned off. Everything else is pretty minor.

At this point I found my kettle. Here are the others I considered, but ultimately didn't review:

* Ruled out because ugly (not a fan of the stainless steel look)
   * Bonavita
   * Hario Electric Gooseneck Kettle
   * OXO (also seems to be discontinued?)
* Ruled out because expensive
   * Brewista Artisan - Redditors claim it can be found for under $100, but I can't find that price ... save the ""Candy Edition"" which gets ruled out for aesthetics
   * Fellow Stagg EKG (only Quince seems to give a discount in the form of a gift card)
* Ruled out for other reasons
   * Govee - Smart kettle, in price range, only has preset temps, only 0.8L
   * Cocinare FLOW M9 - Looks like they tried to improve on the B9 temp control with a knob, although other issues seem to remain. Originally was \~$110, recently marked down to \~$90, but ""Import duties and customs fees are not included.""

Hope this helps someone else looking!

hello, i just wanted to share something about my own break-up. so me\[f19\] and my former partner\[m24\] been together for one year but 2 weeks ago we ended our relationship and i feel almost nothing today, like as i've moved on too fast that it feels very weird... 

but like 2 months ago we had a talk about 'what if we break up'. in this conversation he brought up that we would want to incorporate other people, he doesn't like labels, so he disliked that i called his idea 'an open relationship'. these type of talks were, actually, very frequent.  he brought up some potential people that the he would like to 'date'/'try' (idk??) and i didn't because i haven't even thought about other people.

so after multiple times that we talked about these 'hypotheticals' i think i processed the shit out of this relationship. like i feared what would it be living without him, living no more with my closest person. now i just feel numb, like i processed this thing while being with him? he also said that september might have been just an ending chapter for us, that it's been heading there since september.

on the day of the break up i cried so hard that i couldn't sleep for like 2 hours after trying to get into bed. from what he said, he didn't really cry, but it hurts him. i'm his first real love. we had very underlying problems, but we could say that it was the healthiest relationship for us both. 

we still have contact, we call every night to say goodnight, and we even cuddle, hold hands together. he wanted us to do all these things after we've broken up. he has hope that we eventually get back together, he wanted to keep us as best friends, i don't really know what i want from him anymore. but now that time has passed, i think it's a bit unhealthy - we behave like a couple while not really being one. yes, our relationship now feels far more freeing and good than before, but i think that it's like this just because of the lack of responsibility.  

so now i just sit and wonder did i move on too fast? did i ever love him? please help me shed some light on my situation...",1,1761498766.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1ogq00x,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1ogq00x/eggs_and_oranges_and_greek_yogurt/,Eggs and Oranges. And Greek Yogurt.,"Hi all. In light of recent events with the government shut down and food. I just wanted to spill some knowledge I have about nutrition. It might help people. With all the holiday stress going on, people are more likely to drink and smoke a way to cope with the government absurdity and lack of funds. That will lower your immune system. Cause gut health issues which then manifest into full blown auto immune diseases. 

Not that everyone who's on here drinks or has an alcohol problem. However. Take it from someone who ate ramen for years and drank on the weekends, just to make my healthier food stretch: Y'all cannot afford to do that long term. When you come down with severe auto immune disease, mystery illnesses that won't be diagnosed until years later with actual specialists. You will go into debt from the unknown symptoms that put you in the hospital. Just trying to unravel the medical mystery while in diagnosis limbo. 

With that being said. You can get most of the  daily nutrients you need from eggs and a cup of orange juice. Or an orange. Eggs have iron, vitamin d, b12. Oranges make it easier for your body to absorb iron. I see so many people on here talking about stocking up on ramen. Ramen will keep you warm sure. But the excess sodium, lack of fiber and processed noodles will cause a myraid of health issues down the line. A bag of potatoes is about the same price as a box of ramen but has a lot more nutritional benefits. Plus potatoes are gluten free. 

This post is not meant to be insensitive. As there are a lot of poor and homeless people who depend on processed foods. Mainly because they have nowhere to store stables like potatoes or bananas. Or they have no stove. This is not to exclude those people in a particularly hard place of poverty. This post is too bring awareness. To try and minimize damage as we select what staples were going to try and prioritize as we do try to stock up. 

Processed meats are another issue. Again. Not to be insensitive as sometimes that's the only protein you can afford when you're sick of beans and eggs. However processed meat does accelerate cancer. And all the preservatives and sodium will give you severe health issues if eaten in excess. We gotta be smart. The government is trying to make us more sick and desperate. They are in bed with big pharma. 

Eggs, potatoes, canned or bagged beans, rice, potatoes, canned vegetables are what you want to stock up on. Try and freeze some left overs if you have some from a meal you're sick of. I also was without power for a whole month. There were McDonalds sandwiches and pizza left out for about two days. That didn't make me sick when I ate it. I would not recommend taking that chance but if worst comes to worst...

The hardest thing about being in poverty and having snap benefits cut is getting sufficient nutrients. Especially when you're already immunocompromised and have to be gluten free. Panties give us mainly inflammatory processed foods. Gut health issues are literally caused by a lack of nutrients. So if you're gorging yourself on Pringles like I did for two meals a day, trying to stretch your healthier meals, you will end up in the hospital at some point. Because again, imbalances in the gut microbiom causes leaky gut. Which causes toxins to slip through and infiltrate. I've been to several naturopaths that took Medicaid and they all said the same thing. As soon as I went on a low FODMAP diet for sibo, a lot of my thyroid issues cleared up. I'm still not in remission but it was a life saver. This was after my endocrinologist told me they could do nothing for me. 

For everyone else in this sub who can't afford to eat anything but processed foods for one reason or another: I'm so sorry. Again the whole point of this post was to try and minimize chronic illness due to a food shortage. Beans, microwaved rice, some cheap corn tortillas and a little bit of cheese can be better than a box of ramen for your health long term. Fiber and nutrients are what we are trying to prioritize. 

Also. You do not always need to have a complete protein. I know some people might be panicking. Asking...how am I supposed to afford a bag of tomatoes, rice and beans at the same time? Sometimes you can't. If worst comes to worst just have the can of beans. When you're in an extreme food shortage just implement whole foods as much as you can. Even if it means canned beans with a cup of microwaved Mac and cheese. Or just one can of beans per day. You need at least one whole food per day whether that's veggies or beans or some sort of calcium like almond milk or a cheese stick. Greek yogurt is choc full of protein. I ate that as a college student when I couldn't afford meat. 

So as much as you can, please go for whole foods. Plant based sources make it harder to absorb iron and B12. Eggs and meat are more easily absorbed when it comes to iron. Both dairy and polyphenols make it really hard for your body to absorb iron. So if you're having a coffee or cheese, wait two hours before or after to eat foods with iron. Spinach is also amazing for magnesium. 

God speed everyone. I know times are hard and everything is beyond stressful. Please be mindful of smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. As those both deplete your nutrients a ten fold. That doesn't mean you have to quit. Just be selective and ration if you nervous system or the stress allows you to. I sincerely hope things get better for all of us. On a last note, chicken broth, bone broth or hot soups are amazing for gut health. Please don't give up. Things won't always be so dire.

Currently I use a dry rag to wipe coffee grounds into the trash, then a wet rag to wipe down the counter. But it’s hard to clean around the base of the machine and grinder, and annoying to move them to clean because they’re heavy. My local barista uses a little handheld vacuum to pick up grounds, which I might copy. I’d love your cleaning tips. ",2,1761498452.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

Now she when university started had conversation with me in coffee shop. I told her bout my mistakes and i wanna give her time if she dont feel good. She said she dont feels it and she cares but just as friend. Four days After on saturday (yesterday) she started following her ex that she didnt like that much and “cheated” on him ? Even he had girlfriend like four months ago but now i dont know. I cant heal and i see people heal so long. Her family liked me and she said she need time to find herself and she is burnt out. If that was so true why do u start following each other on Instagram? Why U wanna be friends ? When u follow your ex again? Its impossible to forget our memories time with her family and our trips everywhere i go is a memory. I had my problems and i was telling her a lot bout them. But if she cared why she didnt say something. All I had was her. Like Why U contact him ? When they broke up she had me. She is sensitive person and dont believe much people :( Why just not talk it out. She was saying us forever. I was her safe place. Then this ? I feel like i cant make it.

The good is that I have the want, the knowledge of the product, friends that can help here and there, and drive to make it happen. I'm 27 and this has been a dream of mine for nearly 10 years now.

I could not afford to go to college, but have learned what I could here and there in my free time over the last decade. I managed a big name coffee shop for 2 years with minimal help (hiring, ordering, training, etc) and have 5 or 6 years working for various restaurants and cafes, along with having been manager ServSafe certified. Right now Im working in the apartment maintenance field, but really want to go back to the drink business.

I've always been obsessed with coffee and my dream has always been to open a Cafe Tavern. A medieval themed coffee shop with big wooden chairs, big wooden and horn mugs, and themed drinks and costumes. I'm a highly rated barista with the skills to pull off the front of house, with enough knowledge to manage the back of house, maybe with a little help.

As Ive gotten a little older, I realized an actual Tavern with a full bar would be much more profitable, likely hit a wider market, and be a little more fun to work in.

We have the culture nearby, the biggest Ren Fair in my state isnt awfully far and people travel from other states to come because of how large it is. I'd be willing to move closer to a better market, but its not far, its there without a doubt.

I don't know how to get started though. I dont have the capital to outright start anything, and my credit isnt great because I had issues 3 years ago with a bad divorce.

Is there a type of consultant I can hire that will help do some of the legwork? A website with a guide to get started? Any advice and tips? This has been a dream for 10 years and I know the economy isnt doing great, but seeing the turn out  at the ren fair yesterday really inspired me to make this post and at least try to get help.

TIA for anything. Im ready to put in the work, I just need a starting point.",3,1761498369.0,smallbusiness,7,1.0,False

I’m pretty new to Doha and, honestly, I’ve been looking for ways to meet people and make connections outside of work. It’s not always easy to find people to hang out with or do things together, so I thought why not just start something myself?

I'm starting a small WhatsApp community called Doha Wanderers. It's basically for anyone who wants to explore the city, meet new people, and just do fun stuff in their free time. Things like going for walks, checking out museums, grabbing a coffee, beach days, picnics...

The idea is to plan a few activities each month, and everyone can vote on what they want to do. As long as at least three or four  people are in, we make it happen. Nothing fancy,  just a simple way to make friends and enjoy Doha a bit more together.

If you’re like me and you’d love to have people to hang out or explore the city with, let me know and I’ll send you the WhatsApp link",2,1761498202.0,qatar,4,1.0,False
1ogpucx,https://i.redd.it/oskdte1hmhxf1.jpeg,My journey - 120 hours fasting,"My previous fasting included 18/6, which progressed to water (black coffee and tea included) fasting 24, 36, 60 then why not, 120 hours.  I started Sunday night and finished Friday night.

Here are some observations:

1) Work early, waking up @ 4am and sleeping anywhere from 5 pm to 10pm.  Working away from the family for the week so helps with the abnormal sleep schedules.

2) Plenty of breaks throughout the work days for walks to exercise the mind and body.

3) Filtered water for the first 4 days, then added a one with pinch of salt and tiny dose of lime.

4) Challenge

      a) 0-24 hours - slight hunger and a little dizziness but all dissipated after a 10 hours sleep.

      b) 25-48 hours - probably the toughest stretch (doesn’t help walking around food court and watching eating on Instagram).  Felt really hungry around 36 hours and slept early and annoyed.  Positive was the improved mental clarity.

       c) 49-72 hours - still felt hunger  throughout the day but less than before.  Slept later but still managed 7 hours.

      d) 73-96 hours - my initial goal was for 72 hours but felt amazing in the AM.  No hunger and extremely focused.  Really had no trouble.  Also another 7+ hours of sleep.

      e) 97-120 hours - was for the hardest.  Started off bored and feeling a little mentally fatigued but not hungry.  Probably due to drinking regular water with not much electrolytes.  Decided to go with a zero calorie carbonated water with a pinch of lime.  Then started adding a little salt to my regular water.  What I did not expect was that my stomach was not used to it, so some mild discomfort.  Didn’t help I had to fly back home with the time difference.
    
        f) Refeeding - the reason for my journey to 120 hours was to maximize the health benefits through autophagy and hematology.  What I did realized is the Stem Cells created in the bone marrow required careful refeeding to initialize a proper release.  Eating too fast and introducing the wrong type of foods negates all the work and benefits.  So I started with bone broth, then added steamed zucchini a couple of hours later, then slept and woke up to soft boiled egg with avocado.  Next I had fish with zucchini and kale followed by beef broth rice porridge.  I plan to keep the meals simple from 36-72 hours after my fast.  Then slowly introduce my regular diet thereafter.

What I learned is that it was one of the toughest and challenging mental experiences I have ever embarked on.  There is a spiritual component that is quite real which I really don’t understand but absolutely welcome.  The mental clarity is unbelievable and just feeling better overall psychically.

I hope you can experience this but do consult with a physician prior to doing a longer than 3 days fast.  Looking forward to how the body respond.

    Be present in what you’re doing, 
    Even if all you’re doing Is simply brewing a coffee
    And staring silently out of the window.
    
    Because staring out of the window 
    Is better than staring at your phone 
    And its alluring endless doom.       
    
    And once the coffee’s brewed, 
    Don’t take it to your desk. 
    Allow yourself 5 minutes to enjoy it.
       
    Hold the mug to your chin 
    And let the steam settle 
    On your cheeks, your brow. 
    Softening the tension  
    The day has insidiously drawn across your skin, 
    Without you noticing.   
    
    Relish the warmth  
    Flowing into your hands 
    Sending soft waves surfing to your shoulders 
    Before breaking gently down your back.   
    
    Breathe deeply, 
    But don’t focus on your breath. 
    Pay attention to those familiar, comforting scents. 
    What notes do you hear them playing inside? 
    The bright and fruity rhythms Of Southern America? 
    Or the floral beats Of equatorial Africa?       
    
    With each sip, As the coffee slowly cools 
    Notice how it changes, 
    Evolves. 
    Each time tasting new. 
    The bitterness will fade 
    As the sweetness pushes through.   
    
    Then try to feel the change in you.

**What I did:**

* **Paid**: Ran 2 Google Ads campaigns + 1 LinkedIn ad. Total spend: around $250.
   * I iterated the Google ads every few hours: tightened keywords, tweaked headlines, paused losers. Keywords were everything.
* **Organic**: Posted in a few relevant Facebook groups and got solid engagement.
* Name domain played a good role here
* This not just improved the views on the map but everyone who put their startup on the map now will get the same views. 

**What is happening now:**

I expect the traffic to drop to 7-8k in the next couple of days which is normal, and lots of new accounts and drafts created; expecting more listings to go live over the next few days.

The good thing is that because of me, startups that are on the map receive views as well which makes me happy.

**Next:**

I am planning to keep the registration open for the next month until I release new features. I am focusing on SEO and writing lots of blogs and more tests with ads.

**Lessons so far:**

**-** Don't overthink - after build this directory, I came up with lots of ideas which will work next.

\- Just build something as your first step and share it with people on reddit/x/linkedin. People will love it or hate it but you take it as an achievement.

1ogpswc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1ogpswc/aita_for_being_upset_my_husband_divorced_me/,AITA for being upset my husband divorced me without trying to work things out after I told him I settled for him?,"My ex and I dated for six years. We broke up three years ago because he wouldn't marry me. I was 29 and wanted commitment. He said he wasn't ready. So I left.

I met my husband eight months later. He was kind. Stable. Had a good job. He was crazy about me from day one. We got engaged after a year and married six months after that. I thought I was making the smart choice.

But I never stopped thinking about my ex.

My husband knew about my past relationship. I told him it was over and that I'd moved on. He believed me because I wanted to believe it too.

Things were fine for the first year of marriage. Then my ex reached out last March. Just a casual message asking how I was doing. We started texting. Then coffee. Then lunch. My husband didn't know.

By June I was meeting my ex twice a week. We'd talk about old times. He'd touch my hand across the table. I felt alive again in a way I hadn't felt since we broke up.

One night in August my husband asked me if I was happy. We were doing dishes after dinner. He just turned to me and asked.

I don't know what came over me. Maybe I wanted to be honest. Maybe I wanted to hurt him. I said, ""I married you because my ex wouldn't commit. I settled for safe.""

His face went blank. He put down the dish he was holding and walked out of the kitchen. He slept in the guest room that night.

The next morning he acted normal. Made coffee. Asked if I needed anything from the store. I thought maybe he was processing it. That we'd talk about it later.

We didn't talk about it. He just kept being normal. Polite even. It creeped me out a little but I figured he was choosing to ignore what I said.

Two weeks later my ex texted me. Said he'd been thinking about us. Asked if I wanted to come over.

I went. I told myself I needed closure. That I needed to know if what we had was real or just nostalgia.

We slept together. Afterwards I told him I'd left my husband for him. That I was ready to start over.

He looked uncomfortable. He said, ""I didn't ask you to leave your husband. This was just, you know, catching up.""

I felt like I'd been punched. I asked him what he meant. He said he was seeing someone. That this was just a one time thing. For old times' sake.

I drove home at 2am shaking. I was going to tell my husband everything. Beg him to forgive me. Tell him I made a mistake.

The house was dark when I got there. I went inside and turned on the lights.

Everything was gone. His clothes. His books. The photos of us. Even the coffee maker he bought last year.

There was an envelope on the kitchen counter with my name on it. Inside were divorce papers. Already filed. Dated two weeks earlier.

The day after I told him I settled for him.

There was a note too. It said, ""I knew you were seeing your ex. I hired a private investigator in July. I've been planning this exit for weeks. By the time you read this the papers will already be filed and I'll be moved into my new place. My lawyer will contact you. Don't try to reach me.""

I called him 47 times that night. He blocked me.

I told my mom what happened. She said my husband was cruel for abandoning me like that. That he should have tried to work it out. My dad agreed. They said real love means fighting for your marriage.

My brother called my husband and screamed at him for an hour before my husband hung up.

But my best friend said I got what I deserved. That my husband was smart to leave before I destroyed him completely. We haven't spoken since.

It's been six weeks. The divorce is moving fast because we had a prenup. He's asking for nothing. Just wants out.

I tried to apologize through his lawyer. She said he doesn't want contact.

My family keeps telling me to fight this. That I can fix it. But I don't even know what I'd be fighting for anymore.

I settled for him and then cheated on him after telling him he was my backup plan. He knew I was cheating before I even did it and planned his escape down to the day.

**So am I actually wrong here or is everyone right that he should have at least tried to work things out?**

He sent me a few resources and I went down the rabbit hole, getting a gooseneck kettle, Chemex, and the works. I dabbled just enough to get decent gear and learn basic techniques, falling in love with the morning ritual and what I thought was improved coffee. Over time, I somehow became convinced I liked medium/dark roasts, as I tend to like smoky/earthy/whatever flavor profiles in other things. I even signed up for Trade Coffee’s subscription service and was getting those types of coffees delivered. 

Fast forward to the last few months, where something prompted me to look deeper into coffee. I found this sub, James Hoffman, etc. Through this, I realized lighter roasts with natural or aerobic processing would be way more up my alley, as someone who likes sour beers (lambics), natural wines, etc. I got a bonus at work and decided to overhaul my setup, going full Fellow - Ode 2, Tally Pro, and Stagg EKG - while also moving from the Chemex to a V60. I switched my Trade subscription to match my new targets and even ordered some specific coffees. 

When I started receiving those first coffees and making some cups, my mind was blown and I got so excited every morning to make coffee. I was tasting flavors I loved and never expected to get out of coffee, from lighter washeds to naturals to anaerobics. I was experimenting with different recipes for the different coffees and finding what I liked best. However, after a few weeks, something happened. Every coffee started to taste really bland and lifeless, just like your average cup of coffee anywhere, no matter what I did. It didn’t matter the processing or brand, and I’ve tried quite a few.

I’ve attempt to resolve this and tweak as many things as possible - temperature (85, 90, 95, 100C), grind size (3-7), recipes, and nothing seems to matter. I even went back to the first coffee I had with the new setup, which was a washed light roast, following my exact process that got me some great cups - 100C, using Hoffman’s V60 recipe - which gave me notes of cherry and a very strong earl gray taste. Nothing. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind and I’m super bummed, because those first few weeks were exhilarating. Please help. 😵‍💫

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1ogpjhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1ogpjhr/26m_and_im_looking_for_new_friends/,26M and I'm looking for new friends,"Hey! I'm a big fan of *Lord of the Rings* and fantasy in general, and I also love sci-fi. I work in IT. I’d say I’m kind and hopefully interesting — guess we’ll see.

I’m an introvert at first, but once I feel comfortable around people, I open up pretty quickly. Then I’m relaxed, funny, a bit loud, and can talk for hours.

I live in Poland right now (not a local) and maybe one day I’ll move to Germany. I speak Ukrainian and English. I love traveling, collecting vinyl, listening to music, drinking coffee, watching movies and TV shows. I’m also into trying new things. Next on my list is golfing, but honestly I’m open to anything that comes along the way.

I’m a dog parent to two amazing pups, an Italian Greyhound and a mixed-breed rescue. They mean the world to me.

I really believe in friendship, platonic love, and all kinds of meaningful connections. Lately I’ve been feeling a bit stuck socially since remote work and post-COVID life made it harder to meet new people. I’d love to find some friends to chat with, hang out, or maybe go to concerts, festivals, or cozy jazz clubs together. Anything with live music and good vibes — the kind of nights that make your heart race and leave you smiling all the way home.",1,1761497467.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Luckily I had an old blanket lining the trunk,so it absorbed most of it. Some of it soaked through though. 

I've wiped off as much as I could, used water wipes, tissues etc but I can still smell a faint whiff of caramel (fortunately for me due to my digestive system...... it wasn't dairy lol).

Any tips on getting rid of the smell? Can only smell it if i stick my nose onto the carpet but I'm worried when the weather gets warmer. ",1,1761497427.0,TeslaLounge,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

Nothing special today, just a lazy day. I made some coffee, put on some music, and now I’m just chilling. Feels nice to slow down a bit and do nothing for once.

Sometimes I feel like life is always go go go, so it’s good to just breathe and relax.

It’s just to help you get to know me before you message.

I’m Max and as the title states, I’m looking for a ride or die. Maybe that’s just through being friends, maybe that’s through something deeper? I’m open to that and everything between.
I’m posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I’ve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I’ve lost contact with a lot of folk so I’m trying to build my connections up again.

I’m a pretty 50/50 split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I’m not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I’m almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I’ve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I’m just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I’m also into creative writing and poetry if there’s anyone else who’s interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I’m 6’0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that’s in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don’t ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we’ll click, don’t sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I’m happy to chat through Reddit or move to another platform if and when you’re comfortable and I’ve got no issue with sharing pictures. I’m also a pretty open book so if there’s anything that’s caught your eye here that you want to ask about, please do!

Hope everyone who reads this has a great day and I look forward to meeting people soon! :)",1,1761497202.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

It's weird. Hard to explain:)

Anyways, I'm essentially an active/adventurous lifestyle and warrior mindset practitioner.

Just got back from my 7th Global Solo trip in just over a year to Sweden/Norway on Friday. Just got over jet lag today after a great workout...Open to connecting with someone who is into adventure, solo travel, living with purpose, intention, energy exchange over social status, genuine connections, self growth as opposed to just...eating/drinking/watching/shopping/casual hookups.....and most of all open to connecting with someone who feels they might benefit from my life/streets/world/human dynamics smarts as I love to help others or share what I've learned with others to help them navigate this crazy world.

A few other things about me.

I'm a solo trauma survivor

I'm a content creator and also travel to film content for my Youtube channel  
I'm a industrial music creator(started to work on some tracks already) in my home based studio-think NIN, Skinny Puppy, Filter, Ministry

Work a day job on Bay St in phone sales, which I love  
Into the Martial Arts philosophy as a way of life, trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for many years  
Live shows  
Global Solo travel about 3 X a  year, next trip is Tokyo in February, My 2nd time there in about a year  
I don't drink except the occasional beer or glass of wine. I prefer a mean dark roast coffee

Anyways if what I've shared has made you even slightly curious then get back and let's chat and meet.

I'm actually more into just stepping out of my place and starting conversations with people in the real world in casual passing as I feel it's more real, helps you to upgrade your own ability to express yourself in an attractive, witty and effective way, on the spot, where it matters, and forces you and the other person to display who you really are. This is a bit fake as people can say, be whoever they want to be. So a bit hesitant but hey I thought why not, give it a shot. No love lost, if nothing works out.

The water flowed in a thin stream, the smell of fresh detergent mixed with the aroma of freshly brewed tea. Makar went to a friend's to prepare for exams, and in the apartment there was that rare, warm silence that Irina had become accustomed to for many years of loneliness. She wiped her hands on a towel, mechanically straightened a strand of hair and went to the door.

The knock was repeated - not hasty, but persistent. A man in a courier uniform was standing outside the door, with a thick envelope in his hands.

- Irina Vladimirovna Sokolova?

- Yes, it's me.

- Please sign here.

She signed, took the envelope and closed the door. The paper was thick, the address was printed in official font. Everything inside her was compressed. She felt something was wrong, without opening it yet. In recent years, life seemed to have gone down, without shocks. Irina sat down on the sofa, tore the edge of the envelope and laid out the papers on her knees.

The first words struck like a slap in the face: Statement of claim. On the division of jointly acquired property. The plaintiff is Dmitry Anatolyevich Sokolov.

She reread it three times, not believing it. The words trembled, the lines blurred. Dmitry. Her ex-husband. A man who once swore in love, and then left, leaving her alone with the child. Seven years of silence, and now - a lawsuit. Court. Division.

Irina leaned back on the sofa. The heart was pounding deafly somewhere under the ribs. She tried to figure out what exactly he wanted - the apartment she bought before marriage? A car that he once gave her? Everything seemed ridiculous, like an evil prank.

She got up and went to the window. It was an April night outside. An empty children's swing was swinging under the lantern, on which once, fifteen years ago, little Makar sat, screaming with delight, while his father threw him in the air. Everything was different then. They were a family then.

She remembered that day to the smallest detail: blue sky, the smell of blooming lilac, laughter. Dima is young, full of energy, promising that they will ""have time for everything"". Irina believed then. I believed that love can survive fatigue, life, even betrayal - if suddenly. But it turned out that no. Neither love nor memories could withstand betrayal.

When Dima left, it happened without loud scenes. Just one evening she asked:

- Do you have someone?

He was silent for a long time, then nodded.

- Yes.

- How long has it been?

- A year, I guess.

- Is she pregnant?

He looked up, amazed at how calmly she said these words.

- Yes. Where are you from...

- I feel it.

They sat next to each other, not looking at each other. Then he said:

- I'm sorry.

She answered quietly:

- Don't. Just go.

He packed his things in the morning when Makar was at school. I left the keys on the dresser. He didn't slam the door, he just left.

Then there were weeks of emptiness. Makar asked where dad was, Irina replied that dad had left. To the question ""will he come back?"" - I didn't know what to say. My son didn't sleep for a long time at night, waiting for a call. And then I stopped waiting.


At first, Dima really helped. He brought money, came to see his son. Makar was happy, Irina tried to keep her face. She didn't want to turn her ex-husband into an enemy. She didn't apply for alimony, didn't demand anything. It seemed to her that if we didn't destroy it completely, everything would calm down.

Gradually, he appeared less and less often. First once a month, then once every three. Irina stopped waiting. I understood: life goes on without him.

When he gave her the car, he said:

- I don't need it. You'll need it.

She refused for a long time, but he insisted.

- It's at least something good that I can do.

And she agreed. The car has become useful - to drive Makar, to go to the country house.


Five years later, he just disappeared. The phone was silent, there were no messages. Mutual acquaintances spread their hands: ""We haven't seen him for a long time."" Irina stopped looking. I removed everything that reminded me of him. Photos, letters, even an old mug that he loved. Only Makar remained - with the same eyes, the same stubbornness.

When my son graduated from school, new worries began: exams, preparatory courses. There wasn't enough money. Irina worked as an accountant in a small company, but almost all the salary went away.

One morning, at breakfast, she said:

- I think we need to sell the car.

Makar put down the spoon.

- Mom, don't. I'll work part-time.

- No, sunshine. It's important to get ready now. And the car is standing idle. The money will come in handy.

She sold the car a week later. No bargaining, to be honest. I put the money in the account - for my son. And I felt relieved.

And then the envelope came.


Sveta, Irina's friend, arrived in the evening. The same Sveta, with whom they have been friends since their student time. From the threshold she said:

- Well, show me.

She took out the papers and put them on the table. Sveta read for a long time, frowning more and more.

- What an abomination, - she finally said. - He demands compensation for the car and part of the apartment.

- But the car... he gave it to me himself!

- Yes, but legally it was considered jointly acquired. And if there is no written agreement, he can demand half.

- Seven years have passed!

- He will write that he found out only now that you sold.

Irina clenched her fingers.

- Why does he do this?

Sveta shrugged her shoulders.

- Maybe he doesn't have any money. Or a new woman is beating up. Or he just wants to remind about himself.


The first meeting. The courtroom smelled of paper and coffee. Irina was sitting next to the lawyer. My heart was beating in my chest like a bird in a cage. When Dima came in, the air seemed to become thicker.

He has aged. The face is swollen, the skin is earthy. There's gray hair on the temples, my eyes have dimmed. But the clothes are expensive, neat. A woman came with him - young, well-groomed, with a bright lipstick and a cold look. She held on confidently, as if all this concerned her personally.

The judge read the statement. Irina listened without believing. Compensation for the sold car, a quarter of the apartment - taking into account ""investments in repairs carried out for joint funds"".

Her lawyer got up, confidently objected:

- The apartment was purchased before marriage, repairs - for the money received by the defendant by inheritance. The car was transferred orally by mutual agreement, the plaintiff knew about it, did not make any claims.

The judge nodded and moved the meeting.

When everyone was leaving, Dima caught up with Irina in the corridor.

- Ira, wait.

She turned around.

- What do you need?

- I need money.

- And I need a conscience.

He looked away.

- I had problems.

- Seven years of problems?

- Lena is gone. The child turned out not to be mine. I lost everything.

- And decided to take it away from your son?

He looked up:

- He doesn't have it. You have it.

- Everything I have belongs to him.

They stood opposite each other like strangers. During these years, there was nothing left of the man she loved. Someone else stood in front of her - exhausted, down, but still capable of meanness.

She left without turning around.


The evenings have become longer. She couldn't sleep, tossed and turned, scrolled through scenes from the past in her head. How they bought curtains together, argued about the wallpaper. How he was fixing the iron, and she laughed. Everything seemed alien now.

Makar noticed that something was wrong with his mother.

- Mom, are you all right?

- That's it, son. I'm just tired.

But one day he saw a summons.

- What's that? Court?

She sighed.

- Dad filed for the division of property.

He fell silent, then said quietly:…………👉👉

We live in the same apartment building and work at the same company, so we’re super close and share a lot. She’s a great person, but she’s a single mom with a young kid and a busy schedule, which I totally get.
Lately, though, she’s been making plans with me, like coffee dates or group hangouts with other friends, and then canceling at the last minute or just not showing up. For example, one time she said she’d drop her kid off at a friend’s birthday party after school and then meet me for coffee at our favorite café. I went, waited two hours, and got no texts or calls. When I reached out, she didn’t answer. Later, she called and said she “forgot” to tell me she couldn’t make it. This has happened multiple times, including group plans where she bails last minute because her kid needs to eat or go to bed, which I understand but find frustrating.
Last week, after another last-minute cancellation, I got fed up and told her she shouldn’t make plans if she’s not sure she can follow through. I said it’s annoying because I plan my day around her, and the constant cancellations make me feel disrespected. My tone was sharp, and she got really upset, saying she didn’t know I felt this way and thought I’d understand her situation as a mom. She even cried a bit.
I feel bad for making her upset, but I’m so frustrated by the pattern. Am I overreacting by snapping at her like that?",1,1761496761.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

  Hey everyone! 👋

  I just released **v2.0.0** of Skill Seekers - a major update that adds GitHub repository scraping and multi-source integration!

  ## 🚀 What's New in v2.0.0

  ### GitHub Repository Scraping
  You can now generate AI skills directly from GitHub repositories:
  - **AST code analysis** for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go
  - **Extracts complete API reference** - functions, classes, methods with full signatures
  - **Repository metadata** - README, file tree, language stats, stars/forks
  - **Issues & PRs tracking** - Automatically includes open/closed issues with labels

  ### Multi-Source Integration (This is the game-changer!)
  Combine **documentation + GitHub repo + PDFs** into a single unified skill:

  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""react_complete"",
    ""sources"": [
      {""type"": ""documentation"", ""base_url"": ""https://react.dev/""},
      {""type"": ""github"", ""repo"": ""facebook/react""}
    ]
  }
  ```

  Conflict Detection 🔍

  Here's where it gets interesting - the tool compares documentation against actual code:

  - ""Docs say X, but code does Y"" - Finds mismatches between documentation and implementation
  - Missing APIs - Functions documented but not in code
  - Undocumented APIs - Functions in code but not in docs
  - Parameter mismatches - Different signatures between docs and code

  Plus, it uses GitHub metadata to provide context:
  - ""Documentation says function takes 2 parameters, but code has 3""
  - ""This API is marked deprecated in code comments but docs don't mention it""
  - ""There are 5 open issues about this function behaving differently than documented""

  Example Output:

  ⚠️ Conflict detected in useEffect():
  - Docs: ""Takes 2 parameters (effect, dependencies)""
  - Code: Actually takes 2-3 parameters (effect, dependencies, debugValue?)
  - Related: Issue #1234 ""useEffect debug parameter undocumented""

  Previous Major Updates (Now Combined!)

  All these features work together:

  ⚡ v1.3.0 - Performance

  - 3x faster scraping with async support
  - Parallel requests for massive docs
  - No page limits - scrape 10K-40K+ pages

  Hey everyone! 👋

  I just released **v2.0.0** of Skill Seekers - a major update that adds GitHub repository scraping and multi-source integration!

  ## 🚀 What's New in v2.0.0

  ### GitHub Repository Scraping
  You can now generate AI skills directly from GitHub repositories:
  - **AST code analysis** for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go
  - **Extracts complete API reference** - functions, classes, methods with full signatures
  - **Repository metadata** - README, file tree, language stats, stars/forks
  - **Issues & PRs tracking** - Automatically includes open/closed issues with labels

  ### Multi-Source Integration (This is the game-changer!)
  Combine **documentation + GitHub repo + PDFs** into a single unified skill:

  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""react_complete"",
    ""sources"": [
      {""type"": ""documentation"", ""base_url"": ""https://react.dev/""},
      {""type"": ""github"", ""repo"": ""facebook/react""}
    ]
  }
  ```

  Conflict Detection 🔍

  Here's where it gets interesting - the tool compares documentation against actual code:

  - ""Docs say X, but code does Y"" - Finds mismatches between documentation and implementation
  - Missing APIs - Functions documented but not in code
  - Undocumented APIs - Functions in code but not in docs
  - Parameter mismatches - Different signatures between docs and code

  Plus, it uses GitHub metadata to provide context:
  - ""Documentation says function takes 2 parameters, but code has 3""
  - ""This API is marked deprecated in code comments but docs don't mention it""
  - ""There are 5 open issues about this function behaving differently than documented""

  Example Output:

  ⚠️ Conflict detected in useEffect():
  - Docs: ""Takes 2 parameters (effect, dependencies)""
  - Code: Actually takes 2-3 parameters (effect, dependencies, debugValue?)
  - Related: Issue #1234 ""useEffect debug parameter undocumented""

  Previous Major Updates (Now Combined!)

  All these features work together:

  ⚡ v1.3.0 - Performance

  - 3x faster scraping with async support
  - Parallel requests for massive docs
  - No page limits - scrape 10K-40K+ pages

  📄 v1.2.0 - PDF Support

  - Extract text + code from PDFs
  - Image extraction with OCR
  - Multi-column detection

  Now you can combine all three: Scrape official docs + GitHub repo + PDF tutorials into one comprehensive AI skill!

We live in the same apartment building and work at the same company, so we’re very close and share a lot. She’s a kind person, and I value our friendship deeply, but something’s been bothering me lately.
She’s a single mom to a young kid and has a busy life, which I totally understand. However, she often makes plans with me, coffee dates, group hangouts with other friends, etc. but then cancels at the last minute or just doesn’t show up. For example, once she said she’d pick up her kid from school, drop them at a friend’s birthday party, and then meet me for coffee at our favorite café. I went, waited, and after two hours of no texts or calls, I reached out. She didn’t answer. Later, she called to say she “forgot” to let me know she couldn’t make it. This has happened multiple times, including group plans where she bails last minute citing her kid’s needs (e.g., feeding them, bedtime), which I get, but it’s getting frustrating.
Last week, after another cancellation, I snapped. I told her she shouldn’t make plans if she’s not sure she can follow through, because I rearrange my day for her, and the constant last-minute cancellations make me feel annoyed and disrespected. She got upset, said she didn’t realize how I felt, and even cried, saying she thought I’d always understand her situation as a mom.
I feel bad for upsetting her, but I’m frustrated about the pattern. AITAH for how I handled this?",5,1761496627.0,AITAH,21,0.86,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761496536.0,AnarchismOnline,0,0.67,False

(**Note**: The reason behind my staring was because, I had  
seen her somewhere but couldn’t remember so unknowingly I had done that- “Which  
the girl had no clue about”) 

Thanks in Advance!!!!

‍

**Why This Pick?**

This might sound crazy, but I think this has the potential to be one of the highest scoring games of the day. The Dolphins have cashed the Over in their last 6 straight outings, have allowed at least 25 points in their last 3 games, and have lost to all but one of their opponents so far this season. In short: Miami is a mess, friends. QB Tua Tagovailoa threw 3 (THREE!) interceptions last week – I expect the Falcons to have little to no issue putting points on the board here at home. That said, it’s looking like Kirk Cousins may get the start for Atlanta as Michael Penix Jr. is sidelined with a knee injury. Between Tua fighting to keep his job at this point and the Falcons offense being wildly capable at home (they’ve covered the spread in both of their last home games…) I expect this total to land somewhere in the 50s. Take the Over to cash.

1ogoys7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ogoys7/what_would_one_last_chance_or_one_last_warning/,"What would ""one last chance"" or ""one last warning"" look like?","I was raised by a very toxic, abusive, mentally ill, narcissistic mother and cut off contact with her when I was in my 20s.  Every 3 years or so I'd try to give it another chance and every single time I did she'd prove she hadn't changed.  She'd start drama between me and my siblings, try to turn me against my dad, and was abusive.  She only wanted a relationship with someone if she could use them. She met every possible definition of abuse and narcissism, and damaged me horribly.

So - I KNOW what it's like and I 100% empathize with every person in this position.

Being raised in such an abusive situation didn't teach me any good relationship skills.  I have cPTSD and recently (in my 50s) I was diagnosed with ADHD.  I also have a lot of signs of autism.

I loved my son with all of my heart.  I swore I'd never put him through what my mom put me through, and I didn't.  I did the opposite of what she did and showed him every day how much I loved him.  Or - at least I thought I did.  Then, when he grew up, he met a woman so much like my mom that it gave me constant flashbacks.  I was absolutely terrified of what she'd do to him.  Many times I begged him not to marry her.  Can you all guess how he felt? What I looked like to him?  He didn't see my cPTSD.  He wasn't there to witness all the abuse I'd gone through.  All he knew was that I wanted to come between him and the woman he loved.  He told her what I said about her and then he went no contact with me.  He never tried to put down a boundary.  He never said ""Mom, if you don't stop saying these things about Marie I'm going to have to go No Contact.  Here are my rules and boundaries.....""  He went no contact 8 years ago and never gave me a chance to change.

I just want to see if it's possible to come up with some sort of ""last warning"" or ""one last chance"" sort of letter people could send their moms.  There truly are a lot of narcissistic abusive people with evil hearts out here.  There are also a lot of us who aren't narcissistic or evil but were raised by narcissists and have PTSD and other issues because of it, who would do the work to change if we got some necessary and painful feedback.

I wish my son would have written me a letter about 3 months after he went no contact, stating his boundaries and giving me time to think about them.   He could have said something like ""Mom, I want to think that you meant well and you only had my best interests at heart when you tried to come between me and Marie.  You have irreparably damaged the relationship you and I once had and it would be so easy to just cut you off forever and never talk to you again.  I want to give you one more chance, in case you're really not the person you seem to have shown yourself to be.  I want to see if there's a way we can have some sort of low level of contact and set some boundaries.  I'm an adult now and I'd like to see if things can change and we can relate at all.  I'm going to tell you what it would take for me to be able to allow you back in my life and give you some time to think about this and internalize it.  Then, if you want, we can try to talk.  Here are my boundaries, and if you don't respect them then you're making the choice to permanently end our relationship.""  Then he could have listed his boundaries and said ""I'm going to give you a month to think about this.  On X date, if you want, you can message me to say if you agree to the terms.  You can say your boundaries and I can think about if I agree to them.  If we're in agreement, we can have coffee.  I can tell you what's new with me and you can tell me what's new with you.  We can visit for an hour, and then think about things and go from there.  Things won't ever be like they used to be.  Maybe we can have a different type of relationship.""

Am I being ridiculously optimistic to think that something like this might possibly rescue some relationships with parents who aren't evil but damaged?

  
Edited to add:  A last chance letter such a this would also be a good way to tell if a parent was truly narcissistic, or not.  A true narcissist becomes angry when presented with boundaries, and then refuses to follow them.  The rest of us may feel a little insulted at first, and maybe try to explain ourselves, but a repetition of ""these are my boundaries and they're nonnegotiable"" will soon be accepted by a parent who loves their child and truly want to remain in their life.",7,1761496087.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

**What I did:**

* **Paid**: Ran 2 Google Ads campaigns + 1 LinkedIn ad. Total spend: around $250.
   * I iterated the Google ads every few hours: tightened keywords, tweaked headlines, paused losers. Keywords were everything.
* **Organic**: Posted in a few relevant Facebook groups and got solid engagement.
* Name domain played a good role here
* This not just improved the views on the map but everyone who put their startup on the map now will get the same views. 

**What is happening now:**

I expect the traffic to drop to 7-8k in the next couple of days which is normal, and lots of new accounts and drafts created; expecting more listings to go live over the next few days.

The good thing is that because of me, startups that are on the map receive views as well which makes me happy.

  
**Next:**

I am planning to keep the registration open for the next month until I release new features. I am focusing on SEO and writing lots of blogs and more tests with ads.

**Lessons so far:**

**-** Don't overthink - after build this directory, I came up with lots of ideas which will work next.

\- Just build something as your first step and share it with people on reddit/x/linkedin. People will love it or have it but you take it as an achivement.

1ogov5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ogov5f/day_2_realizing_alcohol_was_never_the_problem_it/,"Day 2: Realizing alcohol was never the problem, it was everything behind it","I’ve realized something big these past couple of days: it’s not really about the alcohol. Picking up a drink almost always comes from something else — stress, money problems, career stuff, relationships, that feeling of having no control.

It’s not about fixing the alcohol. It’s about *fixing* the shit that makes me reach for it in the first place.

Looking back, my cravings were always lowest when I was genuinely happy and grounded — especially in jobs that gave me purpose. Every time I’ve switched to something that triggers anxiety or makes me feel unstable or feel uncertain, my mental health takes a hit and I start drinking again. When I’m in a good place, the urge just isn’t there.

I don’t think I ever truly enjoyed drinking. I just didn’t know what else to do with the emptiness. The past two days, I’ve been focusing on simple things that actually make me feel good — real food, small treats, stuff that doesn’t destroy me. Tonight I made fresh popcorn with a little sugar and salt, and it honestly hit the spot. It gave me that little dopamine kick without the poison.

It’s crazy how fast alcohol hits your body — faster than coffee — and how much damage it does. I think I tricked myself into believing I liked it. But wine never gave me pleasure; it numbed it. It literally blocks the brain’s ability to feel joy.

Popcorn though? I can taste it, savor it, feel good about it. Alcohol was never about pleasure — it was about masking pain.

I’ve also realized how much of a trigger it was to think of alcohol as a complement to things I enjoyed. That idea of “a nice glass of red with dinner” or “a cold beer with fries — good for digestion” was part of the problem. I tied alcohol to pleasure, food, and comfort. Now, if I’m having something like a burger with pickles and cheese, I’ll pair it with a soda instead. It’s bubbly too, and it gives me that same sense of satisfaction — without the consequences. And for a nice dinner? Instead of reaching for wine, why not have a really good dessert? That’s real pleasure. If I associate wine with something I reach for at my lowest *not* highest, it's a game-changer. 

When I’m stable and at peace, I don’t want to drink. If I’m happy, I’ll have chocolate or popcorn instead. If I’m feeling down, I’ll naturally go for something that actually makes me happy — a coffee, a sweet treat, something that feels like a real pick-me-up. I’d rather have the real source of goodness that I know makes me feel alive, not the illusion alcohol used to give me.

It’s only been two sober days, but the clarity that’s already coming back is wild. I feel like I’m finally seeing things for what they are.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
