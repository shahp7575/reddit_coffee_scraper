Some also cause diarrhoea, rosacea flares, mouth burning and sores, you get the idea. Everything I put in my mouth causes pain. Except espresso.

Pourover coffee often can, but the same bean ground finer and prepared as a shot of espresso doesn’t. This has been consistent for the weeks I’ve been trying to eliminate triggers.

I have dysautonomia, so I always let coffee cool enough to avoid triggering a heat reaction. So, it isn’t that.

How on earth is this possible?

1lu1hu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lu1hu6/need_help/,Need help.,"Hello everyone I hope everything is going well on everyone side.

I usually don’t make any posts when it relates to issues of my personal life. But I feel that I need to vent this out.

To introduce myself, I am a 18 male, I recently graduated.

For some background of why I am here.

I gave up on love since the last partner I had. (We were together for 2 years, and broke up on mutual terms. This is also my first ever relationship everything felt serious) she was my world and everything I would have wished from a person and all I wanted was to be around her presence. 

I come from a really sorrow-ish past, where before she came to my life, I was healing from a 4 year toxic relationship 

(which in those 4 years I was being cheated on) that + childhood traumas and alot of emotional weight been put on by my family.

and so to clarify this point here, I met her 10 months after this happened, I made sure to focus on myself before opening to someone ever again. And what's so funny is that I wasn't even looking for a relationship. It just happened.

I have to say that in that relationship. In those 2 years I learned a lot about myself and how to communicate properly. We had language barriers (I am a Dominican Young male and she was a young Caucasian female). grew so attached to her that I couldn't envisioned a future without her.

It hurt so much to see our last goodbyes, I fell into a deep depression.

Not only because I lost my world but on the same week I lost an important family member and academically speaking I lost a big chance to break a generational curse (which I'm trying hard to not lose that chance again) I thought about suicide 3 times for the past 2 weeks, didn't sleep at all in those 2 weeks, been up only on coffee and tea's. I lost total drive to keep doing anything or work towards anything.

Every day just felt like I was forced to wake up. It has been almost 9 weeks since then. I've healed in some capacity, I'm not having suicidal thoughts anymore longer. And I'm attending to a therapist.

I still have a blurry vision of ever falling in love with someone else ever again. It frightens me to even think about all I went through.

And I'm scared of it happening again, but worse.

This generation is fucked, and there is very few people who really believe in working things out and not playing games.

The real reason why I am here is not because ''I can’t move on from my ex.'' I already did, it has been 9 weeks since then and I already took my learnings and kept walking.

But The why I’m here is because I can’t feel happiness, I can’t express my feelings how I used to do and I feel like I’m putting up an act every time I do. I feel so numb, I feel like I can’t socialize. There was this girl that came up to me hoping to connect and start a friendship and I was frightened to even talk to her. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I know every person is a new adventure but I don’t know how to open the sails of my boat to embark on a new one. And if I ever will.

Thank you for those who took their time reading this. 

(this is a draft i wrote -5 weeks ago. for anyones wonder, im doing better, i got prescribed some anti-depressants which ill be letting them go off in 2 days, and some other pills that helps quite down my thoughts and let me sleep.) ",1,1751911891.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I figured I should probably stop being lazy about my own online security, especially since I work a lot from random coffee shops too.

I downloaded ProtonVPN’s free version after reading about it on free VPN Reddit threads. At first, I didn’t really get what a VPN even does, but once I saw it change my IP and encrypt everything I was doing online, it kinda clicked. It basically hides your real location and makes your traffic unreadable to anyone snooping, especially useful if you’re using sketchy or open Wi-Fi spots.

I also noticed it let me access some websites that were blocked on my school’s Wi-Fi. Stuff like Reddit and even some YouTube videos just loaded fine through a different country’s server. I guess I didn’t realize how much control networks have over what you can and can’t see.

Just wondering, do most of you keep your VPN on all the time or just when you’re on public Wi-Fi? And for those who use paid ones, do you think it’s really better than sticking with the best free VPN options mentioned here?",1,1751911862.0,ComputerHardware,0,1.0,False

Im not here to sell anything, upset anyone or influence anyone's decisions. Im just trying to get perspective, so please dont downvote...

I acknowledge that I sell a drug, which is why I am a member/constant lurker here. I want to be well informed and aware of the ramifications of what I sell, because I actually do care and drugs are a major part of my story.

I was raised in a broken household with drug dealers in and out of my life. It impacted my career choices from Law Enforcement, to cyber security in the military to owning my own coffee roasting operation.

While coffee is just one product we offer, with many more to come, it remains the main staple of one of my brands. So, caffeine is something I take serious. From reading up on the latest literature, consuming countless studies and discussions on podcasts, to reading discussions here, to doing my own testing (on myself).

From a tolerance standpoint, im constantly telling people to go on caffeine cleanses to get back to a baseline. Im constantly teaching people about proper consumption and sleep quality regardless of how sensitive you are to caffeine. The people that can sleep after having a cup of coffee (me), usually dont understand that it certainly has an impact on sleep, which causes this perpetual cycle of increased caffeine.

Recently, I had a family member that began having thyroid issues. Before I recommended that they go to a functional medicine doctor that actually did the testing he needed, the doctor mentioned caffeine and to stop drinking it. After doing more research on thyroid issues, I began to worry that not only was my coffee to blame, but perhaps there was more wrong with it than I realized (heavy metals, mold and mycotoxins, etc.) and perhaps I am hurting my customers.

So, I got the coffee tested. Luckily since we only source the freshest beans possible, specialty grade and from a traceable source (unlike commodity coffee), the coffee came back with nearly perfect results. My family member got some things tested and the functional medicine doctor was able to find the culprit. A win all around!

The reason I am posting this is that I am curious how many of you;

A.) Drink bad quality coffee (likely with too much mold, mycotoxins, heavy metals, etc.) and if you've ever tried a more premium cup. Perhaps a specialty roaster that is more local to you.

B.) Have ever gotten a full blood and urine panel to see if there are other things at play. While it could be caffeine, its also possible it was the actual coffee/manufacturer, something else going on in your body that the caffeine/coffee doesnt play well with. Etc.

I've been able to get ahead in life and a portion of that has been through caffeine supplementation (energy in the gym, focus while working or late night grinds, or meeting people over a cup of coffee). I get that caffeine doesn’t work for everyone. If you’re thriving caffeine-free, hell yeah—keep at it. But I’d love to hear your experiences, even if they challenge my own!",1,1751911620.0,decaf,0,0.67,False

1lu1ba2,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lu1ba2/best_esim_app_what_weve_learned/,Best eSIM App:  What We've Learned,"After a year of using *eSIM apps* while traveling and working abroad, here’s the honest truth: **they’ve been super helpful but also kind of a pain.**

Yeah, on paper eSIMs sound amazing. No SIM card swaps, no kiosks, no waiting in lines, no freaking out when you misplace that tiny piece of plastic. Just download, install, and boom you’re connected.

Well… not always.

A lot of these apps are buggy, slow, or crash when you need them most. Half the time you’re guessing your way through the setup. We had a few moments where the app just wouldn’t work on mobile, so we had to break out the laptop. There’s rarely live support, instructions are vague, and sometimes the install fails for no clear reason.

**Still, even with all that, we’d pick eSIMs over traditional SIM cards any day.**

When my wife and I first started out as digital nomads, we were working from the same café every day. It didn’t take long before it started to feel like a regular 9-to-5 just with better coffee. These days, we bounce around between different spots some with Wi-Fi, some without just to mix things up. That’s where eSIMs really come in clutch. We grab a bit of data, tether our laptops, check maps or emails, and save the heavier work for later when we’re somewhere with a solid connection.

We’ve tested a bunch of eSIM providers, and while some were solid, others drove us up the walll so we made a [quick breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JeG7jukkLRq0aJlykDzn45UKu6hr77xXrDqp5kYRC7w/edit?gid=0#gid=0) of our experience.

# Stuff we learned along the way:

Even if the provider is legit, make sure to:

* Check which local carriers they’re using
* Look up average speeds where you're going
* Test their support (if you can even get ahold of them)

We tried big names like **Airalo**, **Holafly**, **Saily**, **Nomad**, and a few others. Some were totally fine once you got them working but if the app is a mess, the whole thing kind of falls apart.

# Here’s what we actually cared about:

* How easy it was to set up
* How much it cost
* If the app actually worked
* Whether it crashed every five minutes
* If someone replied when we needed help

If you’ve used an eSIM app that *just works*, let me know! We haven’t tested everything.

Hope this helps someone avoid the same headaches.

O Café Jacu é invenção da fazenda Camocin localizada aqui na cidade de Domingos Martins - ES. Qualquer outro café feito dessa forma, é uma COPIA. Eles estão no processo de patente do café e a comercialização desse café será PROIBIDA por qualquer outra fazenda ou marca.

Fiz uma visita um tempo atrás na fazenda, voce paga 90 reais e tem uma verdadeira aula de café especial, plantio, cuidado, colheita, e preparação, por toda a propriedade. Além disso, a fazenda possui uma cafeteria para provar todos os produtos locais.

Todo mundo ja deve conhecer, mas um resumo rapido:  
A ave Jacu, seleciona os melhores grãos do café para comer. Na digestão, o grão passa por uma fermentação, que dá o sabor especial ao café. Os grãos são expelidos nas fezes da ave, recolhidos a mão e postos em secagem natural, conforme foto 1.

Os grãos **NÃO SÃO LAVADOS**. Se os grãos forem lavados, eles estragam. O unico processo antes da torra é a separação dos grãos. Após a torra, está pronto para o consumo.

O Café Jacu tambem não é algo 100% original, o dono da fazenda conheceu o café Kopi Luwak em uma viagem a Indonesia, e encontrou uma solução para o problema da infestação de aves Jacu da sua fazenda, que comiam boa parte da lavoura de café. Ele foi tão bem sucedido nisso, que além de ter resolvido o ""problema"" da lavoura de café, sem matar as aves, ele também se tornou o produtor do café hoje mais caro do Brasil.

Hangin by the beach,  
Asked to take my picture,  
Like the universe needed a reason,  
For us to collide.  

One month.  
That’s all it took,  
For you to crawl under my skin,  
And make a home of my every heartbeat.  
We were inseparable,  
Sunrise to long past midnight,  
Each moment stitched together,  
With laughter,  
With wanting,  
With that dizzy,  
Early kind of love.  

And then,  
Just like that,  
You vanished.  
Switched it all off,  
Like I was a light you no longer needed.  
No anger, no explosion,  
Just absence.  
Like we were strangers,  
Who had only passed,  
On a street neither of us could find again.  

You went far.  
Three years of oceans,  
Mountains,  
Time zones,  
And I stayed.  
Not in place,  
But in hope.  
Always waiting for the day,  
I could hold you again.  
Not knowing,  
If you even remembered my name.

And then,  
You did.  
We talked.  
We laughed.  
We healed the silence with soft words,  
And slow visits.  
Then one day,  
Your toothbrush sat next to mine.  
And love came back in full color.  
You said “YES!”,  
With a ring on your finger,  
And I thought…  
Maybe we’re done being strangers.  

But love is fragile,  
And I made mistakes.  
Too much work.  
Too little presence.  
And you…  
You started slipping away again,  
Quietly,  
At first.  
Then I cast a final blow,  
And you ended us.  

That feeling again,  
Silence,  
While making coffee,  
While folding laundry,  
While hiding your eyes.  
And I felt it,  
That old cruel distance,  
Returning like a storm I couldn’t stop.  
Even your body forgot me.  
You covered yourself,  
Like I hadn’t kissed every inch,  
A thousand times.  

And now,  
we are what we’ve always been.  
Strangers.  
Strangers who once danced barefoot  
in the kitchen,  
and whispered about forever.  
Strangers who swore,  
we’d never be.  

But I see it now.  
We were always strangers,  
because no matter how close we pressed,  
no matter how deep the love,  
life is lived alone.  
You can’t crawl into someone’s mind,  
and stay.  
You can only visit,  
and hope they leave the door unlocked.  

Still,  
if the world spins us together again,  
as it has before,  
I will love you as a stranger,  
without asking you to be anything else.  
Because maybe,  
that’s the only way,  
love ever really lasts.  ",1,1751911394.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

Last week he sent me a long email apologising, saying therapy opened his eyes, he quit drinking, he loves me, and he only wants one coffee to prove he has changed. Reading it lifted and crushed me at the same time. Part of me is relieved he admits what he did. Another part feels the familiar tightness in my stomach whenever his name pops up on my screen.

Since then I have saved every message, replied that I need space, spoken to my therapist, and reached out to a domestic-violence helpline. My family is split, some believe people can grow, others tell me to keep running. I have rebuilt so much of my self-worth and I’m scared that opening the door, even a crack, could unravel months of work. Yet the good memories still tug at me and make me question my judgment.

Have any of you given an abusive partner a second chance? Did it truly work? What signs convinced you they had changed, or warned you that you were stepping back into danger? If you kept firm no-contact, how did you protect those boundaries when curiosity crept in?

1lu166f,https://i.redd.it/mtd8v1qdrhbf1.jpeg,First Impressions,"Not in any particular order, but I got around to testing some decants today. Bought them from Darsh shout out to him for very fast delivery & prompt responses.


I’ve tried and owned quite a few already (Supremacy CE, 9PM, 9PM Rebel, SNOI, SIO, Turathi Brown, Vintage Radio, Hawas Black, Duex II Expression, Royal Blend, CDNIM), but today’s lineup is different. Here’s a quick rundown:


1. Armaf Urban Man Elixir : 
Honestly? This one slaps. Super masculine, bold, and sexy. It gave me instant Sauvage EDP vibes. Definitely all-year-round and office-safe if you go light on the trigger.

2. Afnan Rare Reef : 
Fresh, citrusy, a little sweet, and very clean. It’s got that slightly soapy vibe, which might not be for everyone, but I found it super wearable in high heat. Great summer daily driver.

3. Hawas Ice : 
Feels like OG Hawas. Bubblegum sweetness is toned way down, and replaced with fresh citrus, mint, and a soft powdery-musky drydown. Cleaner, youthful more refined in a way.

4. Afnan Historic Sahara : 
Imagine Liquid Brun without the orange blossom and somehow better. Doesn’t smell synthetic at all, very smooth and well-blended. I actually prefer this over Brun. 

5. Khamrah Qahwa : 
The coffee addition here does wonders. Keeps the OG Khamrah DNA but adds a rich, roasted coffee layer that makes it feel darker and more masculine. I’d take this over the original any day

6. Lattafa The Kingdom : 
Vanilla-lavender-mint combo easier to wear. No prominent tobacco note here, and way less sweeter than Le Male can be. A good option for those who want cheap Le Male Vibes.

Has anyone tried any of these let me know your thoughts as well. Open to recommendations too.",1,1751911176.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

\*! The guide will be continuously updated with any new information\*



\*\*\*\*\*

\### 💠 BASIC INFORMATION

\*\*\*\*\*



1. \*\*ABILITY MASTERY\*\* \[outside of a playthrough\]

Each playthrough grants you certain rewards outside of it. One of those are Mastery points. You can use them to upgrade your Mastery trees. There are 3 kinds of Mastery: \*\*Battle, Explore and Observe\*. \*\*Battle Mastery\*\* grants you permanent buffs combat-wise. \*\*Explore Mastery\*\* makes the exploration and in Locations easier by granting bonuses regarding nodes, Boss fights and Action points. \*\*Observe Mastery\*\* improves your Influence points gain, as well as grants other improvements whenever you visit different nodes.



\*! RECOMMENDATION | Upgrade your Explore Mastery to the max level first. Its last upgrade lets you see \*\*hidden nodes\*\*, specifically - \*\*Encounters where you can obtain Keepsake Items to unlock Secret Endings\*\*\*

\*! RECOMMENDATION | If you're planning to complete Challenge difficulty, upgrade your Battle Mastery to the max level before attempting. 



2. \*\*INFLUENCE SYSTEM\*\*



In this game mode, you can collect influence for next factions:

\* Tanakahli \[green\]

\* Academy \[blue\]

\* Rangers \[orange\]

! Influence gives you access to \*\*Faction Assist, specific locations and specific endings.\*\*



3. \*\*FACTION ASSIST\*\* \[or MASTERY in the playthrough

Faction Assist is a skill that appears on your screen in combat. It has a smaller button, highlighted with yellow. You are able to use it in battles after its cooldown ends. There are 3 Masteries in total, each corresponds to one faction. \*\*Mastery has 3 levels, which activate when your Influence with a specific faction reaches 20, 80 and 150.\*\*



4. \*\*NODES\*\*



There are multicolored, single-colored and white-colored nodes.



\*\*Multicolored:\*\*

\* \*\*Battle\*\* - fight and earn points of a random Faction.

\* \*\*Crisis\*\* - redirects you to one of either factionless or Faction-specific Crises, or a Crisis where you can earn Influence for multiple Factions.

\* \*\*Encounter\*\* - redirects you to one of either factionless or Faction-specific Encounters.

\* \*\*Recreation\*\* - redirects you to one of Faction-specific mini-games.



\*\*Single-colored\*\*:

\* \*\*Battle\*\* - fight and earn points of a specific Faction.

\* \*\*Crisis\*\* - one of Faction-specific Crises. Mostly triggers combat, sometimes only an interaction.

\* \*\*Encounter\*\* - one of Faction-specific Encounters. Triggers a certain interaction.

\* \*\*Recreation\*\* - one of Faction specific mini-games. Grants you gear, coins or items as a reward.



\*\*White-colored\*\*:

\* \*\*Lucky\*\* - gives you free items or gear, or lets you play ""Kahli's Scratch"" - coins bingo.

\* \*\*Shop\*\* - lets you buy items. Gear is refreshable, items aren't.

\* \*\*ONE specific Encounter\*\* - gives you a universal Keepsake \[more about it in KEEPSAKES\].



\*! RECOMMENDATION | For the sake of efficiency, I'd suggest that the best priority is Multicolored > Single-colored, and Encounter > Crisis > Battle. Encounters have the biggest variety. Some Crises only get triggered after specific Encounters, and Multicolored are always worth trying out. Lucky is only worth using if you still haven't obtained the Achievement for ""Kahli's Scratch"" game, then can be abandoned.\*



\*\*\*\*\*

\### 🗂 ROUTES AND ENDINGS

\*\*\*\*\*



Generically, the game mode has one structure.



\* 1. Echo of Kahli 1 | Story

\* 2. Bustling City | factionless Location

\* 3. Echo of Kahli 2 | Story

\* 4. A list of Locations to choose from:

	\* Residential District | Tanakahli favored nodes

	\* Research Grounds | Academy favored nodes

	\* Ranger's Camp | Rangers favored nodes

\* 5. A list of Locations to choose from:

	\* Town Center | Tanakahli favored nodes -> leads to Tanakahli Epilogue

	\* Provisional Lab | Academy favored nodes -> leads to Academy Epilogue

	\* Rangers Tavern | Rangers favored nodes -> leads to Rangers Epilogue

	\* Central Rainforest | factionless -> leads to Echo of Kahli



\*In Story chapters, certain choices can increase your Influence with certain Factions\*

\*\*! If the location is Faction-favored, then it will have more nodes of that faction.\*\*

\*\*! Only the LAST choice of location impacts what kind of Epilogue chapter you get.\*\*



Every Love Interest has 4 routes:

\* Tanakahli \[Faction\]

\* Academy \[Faction\]

\* Rangers \[Faction\]

\* Kahli \[secret route\]



Each route has 1 standard and 1 special ending. Every Special Ending for Faction routes \*\*require\*\* you to have to reach 150 Influence for the corresponding Faction. If you don't have enough Influence, you'll only be able to access the Standard Ending dialogue options. Each Special Ending can lead you to a Secret Ending if you own a \*\*Keepsake Item\*\* of your LI.



Kahli route is \*\*special\*\*.

A proper final chapter is \*\*inaccessible\*\*, \*unless\* you \*\*reach all Special Endings in all Faction routes (3 in total)\*\*. Until then, you will be disruptively redirected onto the Ending ""Vanished Island"".

Only \*after\* completing all other routes, you can get to the \*\*Chapter ""Echo of Kahli""\*\*. There, depending on your chosen dialogue option, you can access either of: 

\* Special Ending ""Echo of Kahli""

	\+ with a Keepsake ""Kahli Flower Seed"", turns into a \*\*Secret Ending ""Divine Gift""\*\*

\* Standard Ending ""Vanished Island""

\### ⚖️ ACHIEVEMENTS

\*\*\*\*\*



Majority of Achievements are very easily obtainable as you're on your way to complete this game mode. But there are a few that require extra effort.



\* \*\*Scratch Oracle\*\* | In Lucky node you can get an Encounter where you are offered scratch tickets. Always buy more! If you get 9 of the same symbol on it, you'll get an achievement.



\* \*\*Restock Please!\*\* | To get achievement, you must buy 9 items in 1(!) single Shop. But usually the Shop owns 7 items. For it to be 9, you must obtain Item \*\*""Trial Scales""\*\*. It gives you a 50% chance that there will be extra items in the shop when you open it. The item is obtained randomly through Encounter/Lucky nodes. And make sure you have enough Coins to buy items in Shop!



\* \*\*Triple Effect!\*\* | To get this achievement, you must:

1. Get \*\*Encounter ""Keep the Camera Rolling"" \[factionless\]\*\* and invest in any of the Factions.

*****
### 💠 BASIC INFORMATION
*****

1. **ABILITY MASTERY** [outside of a playthrough]

Each playthrough grants you certain rewards outside of it. One of those are Mastery points. You can use them to upgrade your Mastery trees. There are 3 kinds of Mastery: **Battle, Explore and Observe*. **Battle Mastery** grants you permanent buffs combat-wise. **Explore Mastery** makes the exploration and in Locations easier by granting bonuses regarding nodes, Boss fights and Action points. **Observe Mastery** improves your Influence points gain, as well as grants other improvements whenever you visit different nodes.

*! RECOMMENDATION | Upgrade your Explore Mastery to the max level first. Its last upgrade lets you see **hidden nodes**, specifically - **Encounters where you can obtain Keepsake Items to unlock Secret Endings***
*! RECOMMENDATION | If you're planning to complete Challenge difficulty, upgrade your Battle Mastery to the max level before attempting. 

2. **INFLUENCE SYSTEM**

In this game mode, you can collect influence for next factions:
* Tanakahli [green]
* Academy [blue]
* Rangers [orange]

! Influence gives you access to **Faction Assist, specific locations and specific endings.**


3. **FACTION ASSIST** [or MASTERY in the playthrough]

Faction Assist is a skill that appears on your screen in combat. It has a smaller button, highlighted with yellow. You are able to use it in battles after its cooldown ends. There are 3 Masteries in total, each corresponds to one faction. **Mastery has 3 levels, which activate when your Influence with a specific faction reaches 20, 80 and 150.**

4. **NODES**

There are multicolored, single-colored and white-colored nodes.

**Multicolored:**
* **Battle** - fight and earn points of a random Faction.
* **Crisis** - redirects you to one of either factionless or Faction-specific Crises, or a Crisis where you can earn Influence for multiple Factions.
* **Encounter** - redirects you to one of either factionless or Faction-specific Encounters.
* **Recreation** - redirects you to one of Faction-specific mini-games.

**Single-colored**:
* **Battle** - fight and earn points of a specific Faction.
* **Crisis** - one of Faction-specific Crises. Mostly triggers combat, sometimes only an interaction.
* **Encounter** - one of Faction-specific Encounters. Triggers a certain interaction.
* **Recreation** - one of Faction specific mini-games. Grants you gear, coins or items as a reward.

**White-colored**:
* **Lucky** - gives you free items or gear, or lets you play ""Kahli's Scratch"" - coins bingo.
* **Shop** - lets you buy items. Gear is refreshable, items aren't.
* **ONE specific Encounter** - gives you a universal Keepsake [more about it in KEEPSAKES].

*! RECOMMENDATION | For the sake of efficiency, I'd suggest that the best priority is Multicolored > Single-colored, and Encounter > Crisis > Battle. Encounters have the biggest variety. Some Crises only get triggered after specific Encounters, and Multicolored are always worth trying out. Lucky is only worth using if you still haven't obtained the Achievement for ""Kahli's Scratch"" game, then can be abandoned.*

*****
### 🗂 ROUTES AND ENDINGS
*****

Generically, the game mode has one structure.

* 1. Echo of Kahli 1 | Story
* 2. Bustling City | factionless Location
* 3. Echo of Kahli 2 | Story
* 4. A list of Locations to choose from:
	* Residential District | Tanakahli favored nodes
	* Research Grounds | Academy favored nodes
	* Ranger's Camp | Rangers favored nodes
* 5. A list of Locations to choose from:
	* Town Center | Tanakahli favored nodes -> leads to Tanakahli Epilogue
	* Provisional Lab | Academy favored nodes -> leads to Academy Epilogue
	* Rangers Tavern | Rangers favored nodes -> leads to Rangers Epilogue
	* Central Rainforest | factionless -> leads to Echo of Kahli

*In Story chapters, certain choices can increase your Influence with certain Factions*
**! If the location is Faction-favored, then it will have more nodes of that faction.**
**! Only the LAST choice of location impacts what kind of Epilogue chapter you get.**

Every Love Interest has 4 routes:
* Tanakahli [Faction]
* Academy [Faction]
* Rangers [Faction]
* Kahli [secret route]

Each route has 1 standard and 1 special ending. Every Special Ending for Faction routes **require** you to have to reach 150 Influence for the corresponding Faction. If you don't have enough Influence, you'll only be able to access the Standard Ending dialogue options. Each Special Ending can lead you to a Secret Ending if you own a **Keepsake Item** of your LI.

Kahli route is **special**.
A proper final chapter is **inaccessible**, *unless* you **reach all Special Endings in all Faction routes (3 in total)**. Until then, you will be disruptively redirected onto the Ending ""Vanished Island"".
Only *after* completing all other routes, you can get to the **Chapter ""Echo of Kahli""**. There, depending on your chosen dialogue option, you can access either of: 
* Special Ending ""Echo of Kahli""
	+ with a Keepsake ""Kahli Flower Seed"", turns into a **Secret Ending ""Divine Gift""**
* Standard Ending ""Vanished Island""

1lu12xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1lu12xc/horrifyingly_lonely_in_dubai/,Horrifyingly lonely in Dubai,"I don’t even know if I’m posting this for advice or just to feel heard… but here it goes.

I’m 25 half French half Pakistani and I moved to Dubai recently thinking I was starting the next chapter of my life. I had built a solid online business over the past few years making consistent profit around €30–35k/month (roughly 120k–135k AED)

I had invested over €750k (~3 million AED) in stocks. I wasn’t rich rich but I was definitely in a quite comfortable spot for my age

So obviously when I thought about where to live next Dubai seemed like the perfect fit.

It looked like the city made for me.

I’ve always felt kinda culturally in between. Grew up in Paris but barely had any real connection with the Pakistani community.

I’ve always felt like I missed out on that part of my identity.

Dubai looked like the dream: a place where I could finally meet people like me other Pakistanis, successful people from my culture but also international minded expats I could relate to.

A hybrid world, the best of both. I thought I’d finally find my tribe.

I was hyped i imagined making friends who just get it.

Maybe even find a life partner. Maybe build long term business relationships.

I felt like this was finally my time to build a new chapter around connection not just income.

And I was confident: I’ve got a decent sense of style, I take care of my body, I’m sociable and my ego kept telling me “bro you’re gonna thrive here. you’re literally the ideal Dubai candidate!”

So I took the leap. I signed a one year lease in a premium tower in Dubai Marina with a beautiful view

I was getting dopamine hits from everything. The view, the weather. The idea of finally living a cool life, my mother being proud

I’d wake up grab coffee in a cool coffee shop downstairs open the laptop and keep an eye on my business and investments with a super cool environment around me, I felt like I was exactly where I was meant to be

But then boom came the slap.

Reality hit me in a way I’ve never experienced before.

I was trying so hard to meet people. I went to paid business events. Networking stuff and all

But everything felt empty.

I’d talk to people and it was like everyone was scanning you for something. Is this person useful to me? Does he have status?

Nothing felt genuine.

I even tried connecting with my own community. I thought “okay maybe business with another pakistani will feel more natural”

So I met this guy young Pakistani creative agency founder. He seemed a super nice guy at first and super human

I paid him 6,000 AED to make videos for my business. He ghosted and didn’t deliver a single thing.

Bro I didn’t even care that much about the money I just thought maybe we’d actually build something together. Maybe a good working relationship and a friendship

But nah another mask, another letdown.
and I started feeling it real loneliness.

Like soul level loneliness not just “I’m bored”

I had zero real friends here. No one to call up and say “yo let’s chill”

No one to have deep convos with. No one to even laugh with

One of my old friends from high school (from Paris) came to Dubai for a week. He’s in finance doing really well for himself and I met him for a dinner

what struck me was how real it felt to be with him. We were just two humans hanging out and I realized: that’s what I’ve been missing from Paris this whole time! just human connections warmth and trust

I tried adapting, I really did.
I changed how I talked, tried different circles, went to new events. Smiled more and stayed open.. but still nothing.

Even dating was brutal.

I was open to meeting someone serious. But nothing ever clicked.

And again I’m not delusional I’m confident, I look alright, I take care of myself, I’m not out here acting like I’m owed anything  but I was genuinely trying and nothing landed.

I felt stuck and exhausted, felt like I’m failing at life in the most fundamental way.

I keep asking myself:
Why? Why didn’t this work? everything seemed like a green light.

But the more I tried the more invisible I felt.

And I know some people thrive here. I’m not denying that. Maybe they cracked the code or maybe they came in with a different energy.

But for me it’s been one of the most emotionally isolating experiences of my life.

I thought I was coming to build my dream life.
Instead I’m lying in bed every night in my apartment wondering how I ended up so lonely

so I decided to quit Dubai. It was exhausting me emotionally day after day. No real connections no warmth just this heavy silence I couldn’t shake off

I packed my bags, canceled the lease, and gave away all my furniture to a family who needed it and came back to Paris back to my family home.

And honestly? It feels brutal

My mom was disappointed I could feel it in her eyes even if she didn’t say much. She had been so proud telling her friends and family “my son is doing business in Dubai” and now I’m back in the same room I grew up in wondering how it all fell apart so fast

If you’ve been through this or found a way out I’d genuinely love to hear how you handled it. I’m sure there’s still something I need to learn from someone wiser.

Maybe I missed something or maybe Dubai just wasn’t meant for me

This is based on a previous post- the OP was feeling not so great physically with their wfh set up- they actually felt like they were falling apart! :-(

A friendly reminder that WFH allows us to exercise, stretch and have healthy meals. We literally have food at home! 

1) Meal prep: make enough for say, 2-3 days! Clean and chop veggies for salads (or even buy those salad kits, even easier) grill or pan fry chicken/beef/tofu; drain a can of beans, make a pot of brown rice or quinoa. Buy some nuts. If not using salad kits, make jars of salad dressing for your salads: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUewR4C0I\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUewR4C0I_Y)

It's summer, so I make big assed salads for lunch with plenty of protein on top. The prep takes maybe 1 hour on a Sunday, and I will have fixings for lunch for about 3 days. Then I will repeat the prep on Wednesday night, after signing off. 

2) If you can, go out for coffee/tea  breaks- and walk while doing so.

3) Depending on your start time, just do exercise for 1 hour beforehand- walking is top tier - a stress reliever and a mind focuser. Do stretching to wake up and stretch out your back: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itJE4neqDJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itJE4neqDJw)

Most internationals stick with their own crowd, but I’m hoping to vibe with 1 or 2 actual locals who get dry humour, deep convos, and that weird peace in shared silences.

Not into clubbing or chasing Insta moments. More into:
- Late-night cinema  
- Spontaneous walks  
- Music that makes you zone out  
- And yeah, a Marlboro in hand while questioning the universe a bit too often 😅

If you’re someone who doesn’t need noise to enjoy company, I’d love to connect — coffee’s on me when I land (rupee exchange makes me generous ☕).

Kettle's on :)","It's a slightly breezy and chilly one here on the northwest coast, and i've been inside keeping cosy. Suddenly feeling the urge to converse though, so here i am. 

A little bit about me then: i'm 37, 5'6, brown hair, blue eyes, in good shape, INFJ-A. I guess i'm just your typical ex record store employee millennial who used to party, but now likes cardigans, coffee and travel vlogs. 

Not putting any kind of limitations on the people i talk to here, other than maybe overly religious or political people. Just putting that out there, it's really not my thing. So best not to reach out if you are. 

As mentioned, i'm watching an awful lot of food & travel stuff recently. So if you have any plans or recommendations then i'd love to hear about them. Doubles up as the perfect ice breaker also. But if that's not your thing then don't be put off, i've been through so many phases, so try me!

Out of curiosity I added her back to see what she wanted (zero intentions of anything) I told her I have a girlfriend and she shouldn’t contact me. I told my girlfriend the honest truth (what I said above). I thought if I told her she would say to unadd her which I did after with no problem. A few days later she breaks up with me cuz she didn’t know what I was talking about with this other girl. I told her nothing happened and that I told her I had a girlfriend and she shouldn’t contact me. That was on June 25th. The following Wednesday, I was able to meet her at a coffee shop where I poured my heart out to her and cried to her about how much she means to me. My Gf(25) when she broke up with me in the car she said she thought she was going to marry me & how deeply in love she is with me and she didn’t wanna break up with me (5 months into the relationship btw). I thought she was the one for me too but I wasn’t going to say that 5 months into a relationship. Once we walked out of the coffee shop together after a very very good talk. One that resulted in her saying we can get back together. But she wanted to do it slowly, texting and talking again and then on July 17th we’d be able to go out to dinner (I had an air bnb booked for us for a little getaway that date prior to this all happening) she said in the talk that she has to put her foot down to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again. It was stupid on my part to do that. I learned it in a week. But since everything happened that day. She hasn’t returned any of my texts and is icing me out and ignoring me like I mean absolutely nothing to her after how great I’ve treated her. Her icing me out like this is taking such a mental toll on me. The 17th which is next Thursday seems like a year away. I can’t do this anymore. She wants to say I put up a “brick wall” when I get angry but in reality I think it isn’t fair to take my frustrations out on her. I just need to cool off then I’m good. But this… what she’s going to me right now and putting me thru is the ultimate “wall” this is so unfair to treat a person especially after everything we’ve talked about and how I’ve treated her. I deleted her number so I wouldn’t text her anymore. She has to be the one to reach out if she even still feels the same way about me anymore. She’s punishing me? This isn’t healthy at all. As the days progress I start to see myself slowly stop believing she’ll ever text me again cuz that’s what it seems. It’s been 3 weeks and the only reason why we met at the coffee shop is cuz I texted her at 11:11 AM asking “did you really mean what u said when u said you thought u were going to marry me” she said yes. This i feel is so wrong to treat a person especially when i have made it so vocal that communication is very important to me along w honesty which I haven’t given her a reason to not trust me up until that point i guess. I’m loosing it mentally and I don’t know what to do. I feel like im spiraling out of control because of what she is putting me thru. This might be a coincidence but every time I repost on my instagram story she also posts something a few minutes later. It’s like she’s playing mind games with me. I want to text her that this isn’t right to me but at the same time I’ve voiced my thoughts/feelings enough and I think it’s time for her to “start missing me” so I’ve decided to not text her anymore.

I’m Robert — flying into London this September from India for my MSc in Finance at Brunel.

I know most internationals stick with their own groups, but I’m kinda hoping to avoid becoming part of a “brown boy starter pack” if you get what I mean. I’d rather vibe with 1 or 2 local Brits who appreciate silence, sarcasm, and a bit of existential panic on a weekday afternoon.

I’m not really the “let’s get wasted and scream at a club” type — more like:
- deep convos  
- late night cinema  
- low-volume music  
- spontaneous walks  
- and yes, probably a Marlboro in hand while overthinking life decisions.

I’m okay with awkward silences — in fact, I kind of enjoy them. So if you're someone who doesn’t get freaked out by someone being quiet for a sec without needing to say “lol sooo...,” we might just get along.

If you’re open-minded, chill, and a little weird in the good way — I’d love to connect, even just to grab a coffee once I land (it’s on me, don’t worry — I’m still in rupee mode, so it feels like a bargain right now ☕).

1lu0stv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MazesandHorrors/comments/1lu0stv/the_follower/,The Follower,"I’d awakened that morning with a damp chill.  A coffee and a fine Turkish cigarette lightened my condition vaguely, but the strange feeling persisted throughout the day.

The mild walk across the island enlivened my nerves to a degree sufficient for relaxation, and when I’d reached the cliffside, I unmounted my pack and spread a blanket on the rocks, lying on my side in the usual way and opening my notebook to write.

Something about the slow churn of the ocean’s tide, and the cool, breezy mist wafting off of it, dampened my nerves just enough to retain the inner tension necessary to concentrate and to induce the relaxed, almost hypnotic flow always present when I write my best prose.

And so I’d begun, scribbling eagerly in my notebook, when a pale, thin boy sauntered into view, skipping playfully among the rocks and leering ever so cautiously in my direction.

*Leering*.

It was not a natural expression for a child to have.

Entranced as I was by what I was doing, I easily suppressed the vague unease arising in my stomach and continued writing upon the page.

The boy, jumping up suddenly, then began leaping around rather more ferociously, flexing his meager muscles and making faces befitting of a wild beast intent upon his prey.

I again ignored him, his wild gestures but a fleeting disturbance amid the ocean’s vast calm, but he persisted, his movements becoming more aggressive and erratic as each moment passed.

I glanced up at him as he came closer, his gait now a calm and measured motion along a straight line toward me, and he stopped abruptly and stood utterly still, staring down at me with an unwavering intensity.

It was then that I became slightly nervous, as he stood there, unmoving, for minutes, my thoughts drifting gradually and without my immediate knowledge away from my writings and toward this pale, eerie boy — paler now than before, almost ghastly pale.

He stepped again closer, his eyes shadowed black, though I could find no source from which such shade could be cast, as the ocean’s shifting reflections imparted upon his skin an almost ethereal quality, compounding his ghostly menace.

I then stood, stumbling somewhat under the weight of my fear, my heart undeniably arrhythmic, and asked him what he might want, when he, breaking suddenly his trance-like rigidity, sprinted toward me with strides inhumanly stiff, and, jumping onto my back, wrapped his arms around my throat, clawing at my eyes with his forearms bent upward, choking me with his elbows.

On instinct, I fell backward, slamming his back against the uneven surface of the rock, and he groaned and struggled violently before loosening his grip, still hanging tight to my neck.

With a few swift movements I managed to wrench free of his cold and rigid forearms, and leapt quickly to my feet, staring down at him with fearful bewilderment, and he lay there but for a moment, that same ghastly stillness on his face, before leaping up himself and attempting one more strike against my neck.

Evading him with drop and roll, I grabbed a rock as I rotated dizzily upon cliff’s surface and, as he charged me one last time, I smashed it into the side of his skull and he stumbled back, only briefly affected before coming at me again with the same relentless vacancy.

Again I hit him, harder than before, pressing my full weight against him and knocking him to the ground, and leapt upon him, beating his head with the rock until his unnatural rigidity went naturally limp, his pale body sprawled out at my feet.

I gathered my belongings as fast as I could, stuffing them into my pack, and strode with unusual alacrity away from the cliff, the miles-long walk home seeming seconds, my thoughts all the while immersed in the bizarre event which had just occurred.

My wife greeted me with a wistful grin, asked me how I was, and presented to me a sweater she’d knitted for the snowy winter which would soon descend.

I accepted with a weakened smile — the exhaustion from the altercation now setting in and the nervous excitement wearing off — thanked her, and collapsed upon the couch.

I caught up on a few deep breaths, gazing placidly at the calm, blue hue of winter’s hush, the ocean’s mist softening outlines in a mild haze, and my wife sat down beside me, offering me a mug of sweetened coffee just freshly brewed.

We sat silently for some time, enjoying the warm caress of the coffee upon our windpipes and the serene, misty haze of the air beyond the panes.

“How do you feel today”, she asked when the silence had worn, and I replied I was fine, nothing unusual on such a beautiful autumn day.

“Your face looks… that way again.”

I shot her a look, somewhere between surprise and irritation, and assured her my nerves were fine, that nothing had happened and I was simply enjoying the moment’s calm.

“I didn’t ask if something happened.”

I froze but a moment, then nodded to evade any suspicion she may have developed from my unfortunate slip of words.

“Did something happen?”

I shook my head, asking why should something have happened, and I could see the worry upon her face deepening with each question she asked and each response I gave.

As I placed my hand upon her shoulder and gazed intently into her eyes, I assured her I was fine, and promised her things would not be as they’d been before.

She nodded in doubtful assent, smiling meekly and with the utmost care for my spirit, and I rose from the couch and, with one more kiss upon the head, bid her goodnight and walked quietly to bed.

I’m grateful she hadn’t checked my pills, or questioned if I’d taken them, because then I would have to admit that I had endangered both myself and anyone I may have encountered going out into the open today, prone to delusions and odd hallucinations as I am, and, sighing deeply, prayed I hadn’t actually seen a boy today, that it had all been but a dream.",1,1751910354.0,u_MazesandHorrors,0,1.0,False

[Please make these into actual AutoMod responses please, this toom way too long and way too much effort]

__________________

Evolution Firecracker:
Oh my Goonercell!! I absolutely ADORE the Evolution Firecracker! Her beautiful purple eyes, pink hair and skin tight outfit makes my dick explode just like her fireworks. I have never been able to keep my cool whenever I play her in the hit game, Royale Clash. I usually lose 69 liters of baby gravy after I simply deploy her, I have a need to jerk to her of course in a circle. I want to imagine her bouncing on that thang, maybe even a hawk tuah, spit on that thang. I need her to shoot me with her rocket and knock me out so she can give me the most manic and crazy pounding of my life, using of course that petite (Slightly muscular) body she has. 

I have done so many sticky white liquid tributes to her, to the point where that picture of her cannot be cleaned with traditional means. I have been pleading Goonercell to buff Evolution Firecracker so my mommy can be an amazing Evolution! I want her to sit on my lap as we go smoochy smoochy 24/7. I cant believe she was one of the first Evolutions to ever be released, I love that they chose her and made her 10x more, I have sent thousands of dollars just to thank the people who decided to make Evolution Firecracker very mother. I want to be the Minion Horde or her rocket launcher 

I can't believe the troops WILLINGLY try to take out the Evolution Firecracker, instead they should drop everything they are doing and start pounding her, especially Evolution Bomber and Evolution Dart Goblin. If I were them, I would let her ride me like how the Hog Rider rides her Hog.

Evolution Archers:
I FUCKING LOVE EVOLUTION ARCHERS!! I love those 2 twins with my life. Their braided ponytails, pink/purple eyes, petite body and of course their amazing BOBA's (the tea), Clash Royale did NOT hold back when designing the two ladies (Unlike Clash of Mid), they gave them such beautiful ""assets"" to the point where I have had some of the best summits I have ever had. I have sold my soul to Goonercell so I can just unlock the two and use them in my deck. Although that might not be a great idea because I can never control myself when I see them from the back or even the front. I always imagine getting both Evolution Archers into my arena (The bedroom arena) and getting absolutely dominated by them, I would be powerless againts their coordination.

Every day, I search up ""evolution_archer_(clash_royale)"" on a very specific website. To see those two beautiful women again, I can't look away, even in public, I look at them and when other people see them, they even want to jerk in a circle to them (""Say that again?""). Since they are also related and definitely close to the Archer Queen, I would love to have a nice four people happy fun times with them with Archer Queen using her MASSIVE (""Say that again?"") backside to destroy my skull and the two Evolution Archers taking turns on my Hog.

Every time I play Clash Royale and I see them on the enemy team, my heart gets shattered into a six pieces (Evolution shard reference). I can't bare to look at them bring played by another man or woman. I need to be the one they adore and the one they shoot. I am the Skeleton Army to their Arrows.

Evolution Musketeer:
MOMMY EVOLUTION MUSKETEER!! I want mommy, I want milk, I want to be held, I want to be comforted, and if you do not do all these things immediately, I’ll fucking die. I need Mommy Evolution Musketeer to be with me right now, I need her to cradle me and give me her delicious breast milk, that delicious white liquid running down my throat. I can't believe Goonercell managed to make one of the BEST mommies in the game in a long time. Her beautiful eyes, beautiful hair, amazing bod, it makes me go cummy cummy in milliseconds. She is so beautiful that I bought 10 body pillows of her and always have the happy fun times with her (sleeping). 

I love to play her in the hit game Royalty Clash and every time she snipes a beta male troop I have an intense orgasm and pass out (3 times). Because of this, my meatballs are soft, just like her nice, big... uhh... hands. Yeah. I have her reveal trailer in all my devices (Smart fridge included) and I can never focus while using any of my devices. Whenever I play her, I can NEVER control the Tesla in me. 

They didn't even TRY to hide her amazing assets, there's definitely gooners in the name that shall never be said. Anyways, I'm going to go goon to her. Mommy? Sorry mommy... Mommy? Sorry mommy... Mommy? Sorry mommy... Mommy? Sorry mommy... Mommy? Sorry mommy... Mommy? Sorry mommy... 

Evolution Witch:
If goth mommy beauty can be personified into a single troop, it would definitely be Mommy Evolution Witch. She is so beautiful, I love her hood, her beautiful glowing purple eyes, soft lips with dark lipstick and that chestplate (would sniff). I can't believe not everyone keeps posting about Mommy Evolution Witch, there should be a rule to only post about Mommy Evolution Witch (and every other Mommy Evolution). I love that she adopted Skeletons to be her children and yet has never had the happy fun times with anyone (yet). Her MILF energy is off the charts, one time, I was playing againts an Evolution Witch player and I just couldn't hold it in, I creamed all over my room and lost the match all due to Mommy Evolution Witch's MILF aura (50 million power in Rise of Kingdoms). I only hope that she will suck my penar just like how she sucks the life force of her fallen Skeletons.

I need her breast milk to be in my morning coffee, if it were, the energy I would feel would be UNMATCHED, all thanks to her delicious mommy milk. I want her to shove a Skeleton up my ass just so I can get a taste of her armpits. She is just so hot. I cant go ANYWHERE without having to jerk off to her. My friends have been concerned over my situation. Send help.

I have YEARNED for a lady to dress up as the Evolution Witch just so I can fuck her and get a smell of her delicious armpits, but it just would not be the same. She isn't THE Evolution Witch, and that truly breaks my heart. I can't believe those Skeletons are always around her, I want to just make them die (again) just so I can be around her more.

Evolution PEKKA:
Oh Evolution PEKKA, where do I even BEGIN?! Every day, I wake up and get a daily dose of jerking off my weener to Evolution PEKKA's big breasts. Her chubby figure is hypnotizing. I love to empty my Elixir bar to her as I imagine sucking on her delicate and artificial nipples, her breast milk must taste divine, like a nice delicious heal spell. Another part of her I can't fucking handle is her size, she is so big and powerful, I just wish she can crush my skull that way I would die a happy man. I have sent all my money to Jom Henson's Creature Shop just so she can be a real robot I can touch, feel, and love. Her giant souls sucking sword is so sexy too, I want her to shove that sword up my mouth and I wouldn't complain in the slightest. I can't believe no man in the Royale universe just gets massive elections whenever Evolution PEKKA walks by, her harness isn't covering any of her amazing assets.

I have made so many videos of her, taking about how sexy and amazing of a wife she would be. One of the videos is even called ""Why I Did 100 Cum Tributes to Evolution PEKKA (And Why You Should To)"", sadly it got taken down by the soft and weak people over at YouTube headquarters, truly hate when they remove and demonetize the gospel because it's ""NSFW"" and ""Breaks the terms and service"". Blasphemy!!

I will always appreciate how #TeamPEKKA won againts #TeamMega that is one of the biggest wins in mankind. I am surprised how both teams didn't start jerking in a circle to Evolution PEKKA whenever they were playing. A Evolution PEKKA buff idea is to make any men who see her fall on their knees and kiss her boots, they don't deserve anything else from her amazing body. #TeamPEKKA for LIFE!!

Evolution Bats:
""After the 18 months I spent staring into the Evolution Bats beautiful eyes, I have found something INSANE!! You know what the other Evo's have that Evo Bats don't? The other Evo's all have the ""Evolved Gem"", somewhere in their design. While in Evo Bats, theres no gem. In conclusion: The Evo Bats have their Evolved Gem shoved up their JUICY ass."" 

I love Evolution Bats, I keep imagining all 5 of them sucking on my dick back to back until I pass out, then I wake up with all my cum gone. They are so fucking hot, every time I hear their little symphony whenever they get deployed, I lose control and cum all over the screen. It was so smart of them to do that since they knew men would fall to their knees just for them. I can't believe people willingly zap, arrows, fireball or use any troop to take out the Evolution Bats. I would much rather let them take my towers and win my enemy the game, they are too beautiful to kill. If I were in the arena and the Evolution Bats needed more health, I would gladly give up my own blood for them to suck, just so they can heal. I keep imagining my blood and cum in them, the 5 Evolved Bats healing because of it.

Do you think when Evolution Bats give you head and you ejaculate, they heal their bodies? How would their asses smell like, always equipped with a Evolved gem buttplug, it teases me to this very day. ",6,1751910185.0,ClashRoyaleCirclejerk,5,1.0,False

I know most internationals stick with their own groups, but I’m kinda hoping to avoid becoming part of a “brown boy starter pack” if you get what I mean. I’d rather vibe with 1 or 2 local Brits who appreciate silence, sarcasm, and a bit of existential panic on a weekday afternoon.

I’m not really the “let’s get wasted and scream at a club” type — more like:
- deep convos  
- late night cinema  
- low-volume music  
- spontaneous walks  
- and yes, probably a Marlboro in hand while overthinking life decisions.

I’m okay with awkward silences — in fact, I kind of enjoy them. So if you're someone who doesn’t get freaked out by someone being quiet for a sec without needing to say “lol sooo...,” we might just get along.

If you’re open-minded, chill, and a little weird in the good way — I’d love to connect, even just to grab a coffee once I land (it’s on me, don’t worry — I’m still in rupee mode, so it feels like a bargain right now ☕).

Could it be something else?","(long post - see tl;dr at bottom)

 

Hi AskPsychiatry Reddit!

 

I am a 35F, approx. 5'9 and 136lbs. I have a long history of being sensitive (since childhood) and easily led to tears. I experience mood swings regularly, sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes, I cry for long periods of time without being able to stop. I usually try to attribute my tears to something going on in my life, but have found it sometimes happens for no particular reason.

* No history of addiction or substance abuse. Don't drink coffee or alcohol, don't smoke, don't do drugs and am not interested. I tried weed in high school but that's it.
* No known history of bipolar disorder or other disorder in my family, but mental health is rarely addressed in my culture. There's a chance there are issues that were never diagnosed or talked about. I also don't talk to one side of the family (dad left, doesn't speak to us), so no idea what their mental health is.
* When I read about manic episodes, I don't relate. The impulsivity, tendency to do dangerous things, hypersexuality, etc. doesn't resonate with me. I don't get aggressive and am usually pretty disciplined. I follow a budget diligently. I have a high sex drive, but it hasn't led to any impulsive decisions (no one night stands etc.). The part that impacts my relationships is mostly my sensitivity and how easily I feel hurt or cry about things, and my fear of not being loved/accepted/fear of being abandoned/feelings of shame and unworthiness.
* I sometimes focus more than others on cleanliness, placing things in a particular order, etc., but it doesn't disrupt my day-to-day life.
* The depressive episodes are what I feel the most. I'm still high functioning (I'm able to get out of bed and work, work out, etc.) but I cry a lot, experience spiraling thoughts, and unexplained sadness. It's exhausting sometimes. I'm still able to maintain a good corporate career, maintain relationships and do things I love (hobbies, travel, try new things, etc.)
* Symptoms feel worse when I'm on my period (every. single. time.)
* No other health issues. I usually sleep fine unless I'm anxious (other than waking up multiple times a night to pee!!). My blood pressure is on the low end of the normal range. My heart sometimes races without explanation (or due to stress) but I haven't been diagnosed with anything in that regard.
* An average day may feel like: wake up happy, dancing, do yoga. Start work. A few hours later, may feel sad for something minor (a beautiful song, a poem, something I hear in a podcast, a thought or memory) or no particular reason. Cry on-off for a few minutes or an hour. About 1x/month, will cry uncontrollably and cannot stop. If I can, I'll work out or go on a very long walk until I stop crying. Then feel fine in the evening.

 

I've been in therapy for many years. I just started seeing a psychiatrist about a month ago after I broke down (loss of sleep, racing thoughts of work, heightened stress, lots of tears) and took time off work. My psychiatrist is leaning towards cyclothymia. When I read about cyclothymia, I see people experiencing both the manic state and the depressed state. I don't relate to the manic state so much.

I also tried Lexapro for 2 weeks (no effects on me so my psychiatrist told me to stop) and I'm currently on Wellbutrin (for about 10 days) with no effects so far.

 

Are you aware of patients who have cyclothymia but don't have strong manic states?

Are there other potential explanations for this? Seems like some sort of emotional dysregulation but I'm not sure what the diagnosis would be.

 

Tldr: I have lots of mood swings (multiple times a day), have been considered ""sensitive"" and a crier my whole life, but don't really have manic states. Lexapro and Wellbutrin did not help. My psychiatrist thinks it could be cyclothymia. Could it be anything else?",1,1751910170.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I'm at the stage where I have the basic planes (jack, smoother, block, etc). 

I have a small shop, and tend to make small to medium items (boxes up to coffee tables/adirondack chairs). I'm trying to get better at my joinery work.

I DO have a powered router, but the mess and noise can be a hassle. Doing grooves/dados(no stack) on my table saw is fine, but finicky. I'd like to get a hand tool to do those things.

The Tool Gods willing, I'm hoping to pick up something at the Veritas seconds sale. I've been debating between their router plane (probably the large one) or the box maker's plow plane.

The router plane is obviously much more expensive, but feels more versatile, especially with cleaning up grooves/dados if I hand chisel them. People seem to love it. But in a pinch, I DO have a powered router.

The plow plane is cheaper, and probably does 70% of what I'd need, and is obviously purpose built for the smaller projects/boxes I'm thinking of doing next. But it wouldn't be helpful for cuts that don't run parallel to an edge (or within 3ish inches) or have the same versatility as the router plane.

Thoughts? Anything I'm missing re: considerations? Is there a third option? Let's assume I don't want to spend MORE than the cost of the router plane, but...you know.",2,1751910147.0,handtools,4,1.0,False

He was grinding against my round fleshly ass cheeks with that pulsing fat dick fully embedded in my creamy pussy. I pushed up on my hands and told I was good for now.

Kenny pulled out and fell back in a sitting position. I flopped back next to him gripping his thigh, smiled and gave him a wet kiss.

“You took my breath away as usual. You are such a naughty neighbor. I didn’t feel you cum though, why not?” I asked.

“You know how it is, Dotty, after I’ve cum this many times already today. The urge, feeling to do so subsides.” Kenny reminded me.

“Yeah, I know honey. That’s one thing that’s amazing about you. You just enjoy wrecking my old ass, I know.” I jokingly said and kissed him again.

“Stop referring to yourself as old, Dotty. You’re not that old, and you’re very sexy.” Kenny responded.

I smiled and got up, ticking my large titties back into the lacy bra. I walked over to the bar by Diane and Kim. 

“Hi you two. Forgot you were here for a long moment.” I smilingly said as I slid up on a bar stool next to Diane.

“Well, he’s over there waiting ladies. He’s in that rhythm where he can just go on and on.” I said with a chuckle.

Diane looked dumbfounded and asked what I meant. Kim laughed and tapped Diane on the shoulder.

“I know exactly what Dotty is talking about. Kenny has cum enough already where he can just keep fucking. He’s done that with me many times, and it sounds like Dotty’s experienced that with him, too. A good thing there are three of us or one of us would be wore out eventually” Kim said, a sly grin on her pretty face.

Diane glanced over young Kenny, sitting there with his legs wide open. His hard, thick cock throbbing up to his flat tummy. 

“Why not take him a cold beer, Diane. Have your way with him. You know you’re thinking about it.” I told her.

Diane glanced at me, biting her bottom lip than sipping her drink. Thinking about what I said.

Kim then says, “Yeah, go ahead hon. You know Kenny won’t mind. Dotty and I know he won’t. It’s your time to act on those naughty, lewd little thoughts you’ve most likely have had, but are too structured in what others may think of you if they knew. We’re all safe and no one knows but us. Go ahead, honey.”

“Oh my. This is very lewd and naughty. The way I’m dressed is naughty.” Diane said, taking a large gulp of her drink.
 
Diane grinned at us, her pretty face a flushed rosy red. She swiveled around on the bar stool and slipped from it. She walked behind the bar and retrieved a cold beer for our young man. 

Diane wobbled a bit in the heels I borrowed her and glided over to the sofa. Her round titties jiggled pointedly in the shelf corset. She handed Kenny the beer after saying hi then curled her shapely, nylon legs on the sofa, sitting next to him.

Diane resisted her right arm on the back of the sofa, her slender, painted fingers fidgeting his blonde hair. Kenny reached over and ran his open hand over Diane’s exposed breasts. 

“My nipples are so hard. Just like this.” Diane said, a heated gleam in her eyes.

Her left hand rubbed over Kenny’s hard length, giving his balls a cupping squeeze. She slowly stroked his hard cock, watching her soft hand feeling the thick length.

“Just relax, sweetie. I love doing this, and want to very much.” Diane said with whispery tone.

She scooted down a bit then lowered her pink lips to the bulbous head of his cock. She worked her mouth and hand of his length showing young Kenny that she exactly how to suck cock. Being 45 years old, one would think that she knows how, right.

Diane had young Kenny sighing and saying how good it felt. She eventually sat up looked at Kenny. She stood up and started removing the black panties all the while keeping her sultry gaze on the youngster.

Diane dropped the panties on the coffee table then knelt over Kenny’s lap. She reached behind between her legs pointed his hard length to her tight pussy. The bulbous cock head popped inside of her.

Kenny went to grip her round bubble butt and Diane told him, “Just relax. Let me do it.”

So Kenny gripped and fondled her titties instead. Diane slowly worked her pussy up and down on his hard length til her bare ass was squirming on his lap. 

Kim and I grinned at each other while Diane got her rocks off with my young neighbor, Kim’s step nephew.

The locals you pass look frustrated, maybe even hostile. Welcome to tourism rage—and it's happening everywhere from [Barcelona to Bali](https://www.llivo.com/p/llivo-benefits).

But here's the thing: as hosts, we're not just bystanders in this story. We're actually the ones who can change the narrative entirely.

https://preview.redd.it/kjdrw62fnhbf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3622fa640d0de7b7f2410383d8311dec672786e4

# The Real Story Behind Those Angry Locals

Before we dive into solutions, let's get real about why tourism rage exists. It's not because locals hate visitors—it's because they're watching their neighborhoods transform into theme parks.

I've talked to locals in overtouristed cities, and their stories are heartbreaking. Maria, a shop owner in Barcelona, told me she can barely afford rent in the neighborhood where her family has lived for generations. ""Every building becomes an Airbnb,"" she said. ""Where do we live?""

Then there's Marco from Venice, who described trying to get groceries while fighting through crowds of tourists every single day. ""It's like living in a museum where you can't touch anything—including your own life.""

The frustration isn't really about the tourists themselves. It's about:

*Overcrowding that makes daily life impossible.* Try getting to work when your street is packed with tour groups taking photos.

*Local businesses being pushed out.* When a corner café that's been family-owned for 50 years can't compete with tourist-focused restaurants, something's broken.

*Culture becoming a commodity.* When your traditions become Instagram content, it changes how you relate to your own heritage.

*Environmental destruction.* More people means more waste, more pollution, and more strain on resources that locals depend on.

# The Host's Secret Weapon: Authentic Connection

Here's where it gets interesting. While big tour companies and cruise lines dump thousands of people into cities without much thought, hosts have something different to offer: genuine human connection.

Think about the last time you stayed somewhere and the host really cared about your experience. They didn't just hand you keys—they shared their favorite local spot, warned you about tourist traps, maybe even invited you to join them for coffee. That's the kind of tourism that actually works for everyone.

# Seven Ways to Be the Host Your City Needs

# 1. Make It Personal (Like, Actually Personal)

Stop treating guests like walking wallets. When someone books with you, take five minutes to ask what they're really looking for. Are they here for their anniversary? First time visiting? Trying to escape corporate life for a weekend?

At Llivo, we've seen how something as simple as a personalized [airport pickup service](https://www.llivo.com/p/airport-pickup-services) can completely change someone's trip. Instead of fighting with taxi apps or getting lost on public transport, they're talking to a local from minute one.

# 2. Spread the Love (And the Crowds)

You know those hidden gems you've been keeping secret? Time to share them. When everyone goes to the same five attractions, those places get destroyed and everywhere else gets ignored.

Suggest that little family restaurant three blocks away instead of the famous one with the two-hour wait. Recommend the neighborhood market instead of the tourist shopping district. Your guests will have better experiences, and you'll help distribute tourism's benefits more fairly.

# 3. Be a Local Business Ambassador

This is where you can make a real difference. Every recommendation you make is a vote for the kind of tourism you want to see.

Recommend the bookstore run by the poet who gives readings on Thursday nights. Send people to the ceramic artist whose family has been making pottery for four generations. These aren't just businesses—they're the soul of your community.

# 4. Become a Cultural Bridge

Most tourism rage comes from misunderstandings. Tourists don't know they're being rude when they block narrow streets for photos. They don't realize that loud conversations at 11 PM echo through old buildings with thin walls.

Create a simple ""local customs"" guide for your guests. Not a list of rules, but a friendly explanation of how to blend in. ""People here tend to speak quietly in restaurants—it's part of the charm"" sounds so much better than ""DON'T BE LOUD.""

# 5. Get Your Hands Dirty (In a Good Way)

The hosts who really make a difference don't just manage properties—they're part of their communities. Join the neighborhood association. Volunteer at local events. Support community initiatives.

When locals see you actively contributing to their community instead of just extracting profit from it, everything changes. You're not just another short-term rental—you're a neighbor.

# 6. Channel Your Inner Anthony Bourdain

Bourdain understood something crucial: the best travel experiences happen when you approach places with genuine curiosity and respect. He didn't just eat local food—he sat with people, listened to their stories, and shared their struggles.

Encourage your guests to do the same. Maybe arrange for them to cook with a local family. Or connect them with community events where they can meet people naturally. These interactions create the kind of memories that last forever—and the kind of tourism that actually helps communities.

# 7. Use Your Voice

You have influence with your guests that tour companies don't. Use it responsibly.

Talk to them about the environmental impact of their choices. Suggest they buy local products instead of mass-produced souvenirs. Encourage them to travel during off-peak times when possible. Small conversations can lead to big changes in behavior.

# The Numbers Don't Lie

We recently surveyed host communities in the Llivo network, and the results were encouraging:

* *40% reduction in overcrowding* in areas where hosts actively promoted alternative attractions
* *65% increase in local business revenue* when hosts consistently recommended local establishments
* *70% improvement in cultural awareness* among guests who received cultural orientation from hosts

But beyond the statistics, what matters is the stories. Like the guest who ended up becoming a regular volunteer at a local animal shelter after her host introduced her to the organization. Or the family who learned traditional cooking techniques from their host's grandmother and now teaches those recipes to their own kids.

# Why This Matters More Than Ever

Tourism rage isn't going away. If anything, it's getting worse as travel becomes more accessible and social media drives even more people to the same ""must-see"" destinations.

But here's the opportunity: while big tourism companies are still figuring out how to address these problems, hosts can act now. Every guest interaction is a chance to model responsible tourism. Every recommendation is a vote for the kind of community you want to live in.

# Ready to Be Part of the Solution?

The truth is, we need tourism. It brings economic opportunities, cultural exchange, and global understanding. But we need the right kind of tourism—the kind that respects places and people, that contributes more than it takes.

As hosts, we're uniquely positioned to create that kind of tourism. We can't control cruise ship schedules or tour bus routes, but we can control how we welcome people into our communities.

The question isn't whether tourism will continue growing—it will. The question is whether we'll be part of the problem or part of the solution.

If you're ready to host responsibly and make a real difference in your community, consider joining the Llivo platform. We're building a network of hosts who believe that great hospitality goes beyond clean sheets and good WiFi—it's about creating connections that benefit everyone.

This is the first draft of a first chapter for a Southern mystery I'm working on. It’s more of an experimental piece — my attempt to see if I have the chops to write something serious, long-form, and tonally consistent.

I’m **not** looking for hand-holding. Tear it up. I want to improve — especially on things like pacing, tone, character voice, and clarity of world-building. If something doesn’t land, I want to know.

Would love feedback on:

* Is the mood coming through?
* Does it feel cinematic?
* Is the dialogue natural?
* Are you interested enough to turn the page?

Thanks in advance to anyone who gives it a read.





“She just walked in.”

 

Jamen Tensen was a man of the land, the back of his neck darker than the soil he tilled. He reached for his grease-stained red handkerchief in the top pocket of his overalls.

 

“She just—walked in?”

 

“That’s what I’m telling you, Earl. She slipped off her shoes and—”

 

His shoulders shrugged as he raised his handkerchief in the direction of where the body was being dragged up.

 

“Nobody was with her—no guy in the bushes with a gun pointed at her?”

 

“She was across the bank, Earl. I’m not a goddamn telescope. I’m telling you; she just slipped her shoes off and...”

 

“Sank to the bottom.”

 

Earl Timsway cocked his head and stabbed his pencil into his police report.

He adjusted his hat, sliding the sweat ring lower down.

Summer in Mississippi was closer to an all-day sauna than a season.

 

“Well... Jamen... I appreciate it. Thank you.”

 

Earl looked to the opposite side of the riverbank. A photographer snapped photos of the neatly placed shoes, standing in as a headstone.

 

“If you think of anything else, call me at the station or at home. I won’t mind...”

 

Jamen dabbed at the back of his neck.

 

“I’ve heard of men who blew their heads off in a cornfield. Hell, one fella back in ’68 let his combine run him over after the bank squeezed his balls like oranges. But this...”

 

Jamen stared at the bank, replaying what he saw.

 

“I’m telling you, Earl... she wanted to die.”

 

“No one wants to die, Jamen.”

 

“She did, Earl... she did...”

 

Earl turned and kicked the hard-packed dirt of the road just neighbor to the river.

 

“Let me know if you remember anything.”

 

He slammed the door on his cruiser. The leather inside was molten cowhide. The smell of cigarettes leaking from the plastic of the dash.

 

“Another one couldn’t hurt,” Earl muttered.

 

Lighting a cigarette and the engine, he put it in reverse and pulled away, heading to join the others across the river.

 

No I.D. No tattoos. No fingerprints—she scraped those right off. “Plain Jane,” he started calling her.

 

Maybe not in looks—she was beautiful, really—so all the more reason then:

If you're young, beautiful, and have your whole life ahead of you...

What makes you kill yourself?

 

Gravel crunched as the cruiser rolled to a halt. Earl ratcheted the shifter into park and sat for a moment.

 

Cottonwood leaves threw shadows that danced inside of his pig-roaster.

 

Jeremiah melted out from behind his camera, sweat looking like a crown of stars on his ebony forehead, and drifted toward Earl’s window.

 

Earl sighed, letting what little cool air the busted A/C had managed to conjure spill back into the wild.

 

“Well... anything?”

 

“One set of footprints—hers. Turner’s got the rest of the boys combing the woods nearby for anything.”

 

Earl crushed his cigarette out on the bodies of its brothers in the mass grave he called an ashtray and exited the car.

Cicadas all screaming, giving testimony to what happened as the river drifted in its passive indifference.

 

“Any markings? Needle holes, scabs? Anything at all—in her pockets, the shoes?”

 

Earl and Jeremiah made their way to the black body bag being loaded into the coroner’s vehicle.

 

“No pockets on the dress. Shoes empty. No obvious signs of drug abuse.”

 

Hector, the town coroner, was more wrinkled than the body itself and whiter than the paint job on his hearse.

He held the rear door open as two officers slid the bag in.

 

“Any ideas, Hector?”

 

“Well… won’t know for sure ’til she’s back…”

 

He closed the hatch and pulled a Swisher Sweets from his front pocket, the wrapper crinkling like a candy cane as he did so.

 

Earl leaned forward with a lighter. Hector declined, offering a small rattle of box matches.

 

“That phosphorus’ll kill ya.”

 

“Let it try…” Hector grinned.

 

The acrid scent of phosphorus danced with the sweetness of the tobacco. He threw the match down and stamped it out carefully and intentionally in the gravel.

 

“Besides—if I can’t retire, I’m afforded some preferences.”

 

“What do you think we’re dealing with here, Hector?”

 

“Well… if I had to guess, I’d say it’s a suicide.”

 

Hector exhaled smoothly and steadily, a thought mingled into smoke.

 

“A guess implies the second part.”

 

“I’ve seen a lot of young people kill themselves.”

 

Hector said it like he was talking about catfishing.

 

“Some just because they think they’re misunderstood. Others ’cause of a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend. Sometimes for reasons we just won’t understand.”

 

He flicked his Swisher and stared at the back of the hearse.

 

“Cutting off the tips of your fingers, though… now that—

that’s something strange.”

 

Jeremiah cut in. “We haven’t found them yet. She probably cut them off before she got here—judging by the blood on her shoelaces.”

 

Hector took a final drag on his cigar, nodding as he flicked it down to join the match.

 

“Are the girls at the station checking for missing persons?” Earl turned to stare at where the shoes still sat.

 

“I’d assume, but I don’t know,” Jeremiah said.

 

“Well, shit. Thank you for your time, Hector. Let me know right away if you find anything.”

 

“As always. As always.”

 

Hector gave a short wave, closed the door, and drove off.

 

Thickets crashed together and out stepped Dale Turner, sweat bleeding through his beige shirt.

 

“Glad to see you two are staying cool,” he said, voice tinged with annoyance and the heat of the day.

 

“I try my best to. You find anything out there?” Earl tried not to play into Turner's games. The man would pick fights over a game of Candy Land.

 

Turner swatted a horsefly on the back of his neck and rolled it between his fingers.

 

“One thing. We did manage to find a little bit of blood from where she must have walked in from. Looks like she came off the road, got out of a car. Trail starts there.”

 

Earl looked through the woods, imagining the road that cut through it beyond.

“So what you’re saying is that the car was on the main road? The car didn’t stop down here? That means someone else was driving.”

“Now I know why they call you Mr. Detective.” Turner flicked the horsefly to the ground.

“I’m gonna leave two guys out here to keep searching. I’m bringing the rest of the chain gang back into town. Not much else to find here.”

Jeremiah stared as Turner walked back to his car. “Motherfucker wouldn’t know a chain gang if he was singin’ Long John.”

 

“Easy, Jeremiah. Let’s go check out them shoes.”

 

If Earl and Turner were oil and water, then Jeremiah and Turner were two cats in a bag — soaked and pissed off.

 

The shoes were placed about two feet from the river's edge. He could see in the sand where her bare feet had left some marks.

“Not afraid to cut off your own fingertips, but walking barefoot is too much?” Earl crouched near the shoes. “Have these been fully documented yet? Can I touch them?”

“I’ve done everything I need to do.” Jeremiah looked into the river. “You’re right, though. If you’re in such a state of mind to cut off your own fingers and kill yourself... why shoes?”

 

“That’s the $64,000 question right there — why the shoes?” Earl picked up the shoes, white laces stained with blood.

He turned them over and over, hoping the soles would speak to his.

“Well, let’s bag it and head back — see if the girls got anything on missing persons.”

 

Jeremiah turned to look at Earl.

“It’s not a suicide, is it?”

 

“Careful — you’re almost putting me out of a job.”

 

The two men laughed as they made their way back up the riverbank.

 

“Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes?

I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to go.

I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home.”

 

It wasn’t the same as the records, but these cassettes weren’t half bad. Earl had given up on the A/C a long time ago — windows down as he and Jeremiah cruised into town.

The two slowed on the main drag — a mixture of buildings from the 1800s to now.  
A group of women gathered outside of Lampert’s, the grocery store in town.  
The only one Jeremiah was interested in was the one wearing a yellow sundress.

As they rode by, Jeremiah leaned out the window and blew a whistle to split ears — his wife shying away in embarrassment.

 

“Must feel good to be in love.” Earl couldn’t help but smile.

“Comes with its ups and downs, but I’d say I’m winning.” Jeremiah was using the side mirror to still steal glances at her.

 

“Why’d you never marry, Earl?” It wasn't intrusive — it was a genuine question from a man who had seen the good side of things.

 

“Just wasn't my speed.”

It was a lie — he knew it. But it was a good enough answer.

They pulled into the new police department — well, that was half the truth. It used to be the fire department, but they got the new new building.

 

A few patrol cars were outside. The rest were probably either on patrol, and at least one was still back at the river.

 

Earl and Jeremiah made their way inside — Jeremiah heading to the other end of the building to where his cubicle was, Earl making his way to Nancy, the leader of the women who ran the day-to-day and answered the phones inside.

“Earl, coffee?” She said it sweetly, but with a no-nonsense tone — you weren’t rejecting that cup. In fact, it was like she never even asked you at all.

“Please and thank you, Nancy. Did anyone come back and ask you about that missing persons in the neighboring counties?”

 

Nancy poured steadily into a paper cup — the smell of six coffees distilled into one. She said if it wasn’t strong, it wasn’t going to work on strong men. But maybe she never thought about how it tasted.

 

“We’ve sent calls to Leake, Winston, Kemper — any and all neighbors. Nothing so far. We may have to go state.”

She passed the cup to him, heat bleeding through.

“Damn,” Earl muttered, pulling a sip from the oil she called coffee.

“Well…” He lightly slammed his hand on top of her desk — enough to get the point across, not enough to have her reprimand him.

“Let me know if you get anything. I’m gonna go check on Jeremiah, see what’s happening with them photos.”

“Take care, Earl.”

Earl gave a final nod while sipping her elixir. He made it just down the hallway, took one last pull like it was a bottle, and dumped the rest into a nearby plant before throwing out the cup.

Earl walked into Jeremiah’s laboratory, dark red phosphorus smell tinging the air.

“What are we doing?” Earl picked up one of the bottles, pretending to read it.

“Just making copies for the rest of us.” Jeremiah’s voice was concentrated. There was the small whirl of a fan trying to keep the men from dying from the fumes.

 

“You were right earlier, Jeremiah — I don’t think this is a suicide.” Earl put the bottle back on the shelf.

“The worst part is… I don’t think it’s a murder either.”

Jeremiah finished hanging one of the undeveloped copies.

“So what is it, then?” Jeremiah stared at Earl.

 

“We may have to go back to our old roots. We might have to start doing a little witch burning.”

 

Jeremiah laughed. “A little quick to think cult, don’t you think?”

 

“This has more ritual behind it than most people stepping through a church door.” Earl’s tone was serious. Earl himself was a man of skepticism — not a man of God. He’d seen too many godless things.

But he was a man of truth.

1lu0iss,https://www.reddit.com/r/llivo/comments/1lu0iss/how_hosts_can_actually_save_cities_from_tourism/,How Hosts Can Actually Save Cities From Tourism Rage (And Why It Matters More Than Ever),"Picture this: You're walking through the narrow streets of Venice, trying to soak in centuries of history, when suddenly you're swept up in a sea of selfie sticks and tour groups. The locals you pass look frustrated, maybe even hostile. Welcome to tourism rage—and it's happening everywhere from [Barcelona to Bali](https://www.llivo.com/p/llivo-benefits).

But here's the thing: as hosts, we're not just bystanders in this story. We're actually the ones who can change the narrative entirely.

# The Real Story Behind Those Angry Locals

Before we dive into solutions, let's get real about why tourism rage exists. It's not because locals hate visitors—it's because they're watching their neighborhoods transform into theme parks.

I've talked to locals in overtouristed cities, and their stories are heartbreaking. Maria, a shop owner in Barcelona, told me she can barely afford rent in the neighborhood where her family has lived for generations. ""Every building becomes an Airbnb,"" she said. ""Where do we live?""

https://preview.redd.it/g7kapy4imhbf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=928ea2029f0f1a7001a626e75bd11f85245564b5

Then there's Marco from Venice, who described trying to get groceries while fighting through crowds of tourists every single day. ""It's like living in a museum where you can't touch anything—including your own life.""

The frustration isn't really about the tourists themselves. It's about:

*Overcrowding that makes daily life impossible.* Try getting to work when your street is packed with tour groups taking photos.

*Local businesses being pushed out.* When a corner café that's been family-owned for 50 years can't compete with tourist-focused restaurants, something's broken.

*Culture becoming a commodity.* When your traditions become Instagram content, it changes how you relate to your own heritage.

*Environmental destruction.* More people means more waste, more pollution, and more strain on resources that locals depend on.

# The Host's Secret Weapon: Authentic Connection

Here's where it gets interesting. While big tour companies and cruise lines dump thousands of people into cities without much thought, hosts have something different to offer: genuine human connection.

Think about the last time you stayed somewhere and the host really cared about your experience. They didn't just hand you keys—they shared their favorite local spot, warned you about tourist traps, maybe even invited you to join them for coffee. That's the kind of tourism that actually works for everyone.

# Seven Ways to Be the Host Your City Needs

# 1. Make It Personal (Like, Actually Personal)

Stop treating guests like walking wallets. When someone books with you, take five minutes to ask what they're really looking for. Are they here for their anniversary? First time visiting? Trying to escape corporate life for a weekend?

At Llivo, we've seen how something as simple as a personalized [airport pickup service](https://www.llivo.com/p/airport-pickup-services) can completely change someone's trip. Instead of fighting with taxi apps or getting lost on public transport, they're talking to a local from minute one.

# 2. Spread the Love (And the Crowds)

You know those hidden gems you've been keeping secret? Time to share them. When everyone goes to the same five attractions, those places get destroyed and everywhere else gets ignored.

Suggest that little family restaurant three blocks away instead of the famous one with the two-hour wait. Recommend the neighborhood market instead of the tourist shopping district. Your guests will have better experiences, and you'll help distribute tourism's benefits more fairly.

# 3. Be a Local Business Ambassador

This is where you can make a real difference. Every recommendation you make is a vote for the kind of tourism you want to see.

Recommend the bookstore run by the poet who gives readings on Thursday nights. Send people to the ceramic artist whose family has been making pottery for four generations. These aren't just businesses—they're the soul of your community.

# 4. Become a Cultural Bridge

Most tourism rage comes from misunderstandings. Tourists don't know they're being rude when they block narrow streets for photos. They don't realize that loud conversations at 11 PM echo through old buildings with thin walls.

Create a simple ""local customs"" guide for your guests. Not a list of rules, but a friendly explanation of how to blend in. ""People here tend to speak quietly in restaurants—it's part of the charm"" sounds so much better than ""DON'T BE LOUD.""

# 5. Get Your Hands Dirty (In a Good Way)

The hosts who really make a difference don't just manage properties—they're part of their communities. Join the neighborhood association. Volunteer at local events. Support community initiatives.

When locals see you actively contributing to their community instead of just extracting profit from it, everything changes. You're not just another short-term rental—you're a neighbor.

# 6. Channel Your Inner Anthony Bourdain

Bourdain understood something crucial: the best travel experiences happen when you approach places with genuine curiosity and respect. He didn't just eat local food—he sat with people, listened to their stories, and shared their struggles.

Encourage your guests to do the same. Maybe arrange for them to cook with a local family. Or connect them with community events where they can meet people naturally. These interactions create the kind of memories that last forever—and the kind of tourism that actually helps communities.

# 7. Use Your Voice

You have influence with your guests that tour companies don't. Use it responsibly.

Talk to them about the environmental impact of their choices. Suggest they buy local products instead of mass-produced souvenirs. Encourage them to travel during off-peak times when possible. Small conversations can lead to big changes in behavior.

# The Numbers Don't Lie

We recently surveyed host communities in the Llivo network, and the results were encouraging:

* *40% reduction in overcrowding* in areas where hosts actively promoted alternative attractions
* *65% increase in local business revenue* when hosts consistently recommended local establishments
* *70% improvement in cultural awareness* among guests who received cultural orientation from hosts

But beyond the statistics, what matters is the stories. Like the guest who ended up becoming a regular volunteer at a local animal shelter after her host introduced her to the organization. Or the family who learned traditional cooking techniques from their host's grandmother and now teaches those recipes to their own kids.

# Why This Matters More Than Ever

Tourism rage isn't going away. If anything, it's getting worse as travel becomes more accessible and social media drives even more people to the same ""must-see"" destinations.

But here's the opportunity: while big tourism companies are still figuring out how to address these problems, hosts can act now. Every guest interaction is a chance to model responsible tourism. Every recommendation is a vote for the kind of community you want to live in.

# Ready to Be Part of the Solution?

The truth is, we need tourism. It brings economic opportunities, cultural exchange, and global understanding. But we need the right kind of tourism—the kind that respects places and people, that contributes more than it takes.

As hosts, we're uniquely positioned to create that kind of tourism. We can't control cruise ship schedules or tour bus routes, but we can control how we welcome people into our communities.

The question isn't whether tourism will continue growing—it will. The question is whether we'll be part of the problem or part of the solution.

If you're ready to host responsibly and make a real difference in your community, consider joining the Llivo platform. We're building a network of hosts who believe that great hospitality goes beyond clean sheets and good WiFi—it's about creating connections that benefit everyone.

1lu0iex,https://i.redd.it/mvrwdw11nhbf1.jpeg,Margaret gets a little too much hate imo,"
I think Margaret gets a little too much hate

Now that’s not to say she doesn’t earn criticism for some of her actions. I do definitely agree that her kissing Mordecai was fucked, regardless of the whole unresolved feelings rushing back thing, and CJ had every right to feel untrustworthy of her and Mordecai being around each other. And while I understand her wanting to focus on her studies and finishing her degree, on paper that’s valid, she also didn’t keep in contact with Mordecai at all after she left, like CJs kinda right why did you even dump him if you’re that into him (although it’s a bit odd Margaret didjt also tell CJ that she lied about having a boyfriend so she wouldn’t kill her).

For criticisms I don’t agree with I’ve seen many fans say Margaret is “for the streets” and “had a new boyfriend in every episode”/“played with Mordecai’s emotions”. I..don’t really think this is a fair assessment of her. True there was a bit of a running gag in the first three seasons where Mordecai would do something because he thought it would give him a chance with Margaret, only for it to be revealed she has a new boyfriend. However, this gag is only in three episodes, 

* Caffeinated concert tickets - Slasher, where she’s mad at him for being a jerk to Mordecai, implying his personality will lead to her dumping him
* Mordecai and the Rigbys - the Angel guy who went on before Mordecai and Rigby, 
* Do Me A Solid - Margaret mentions she cancelled a date so she could hang with Eileen and the guys so that Eileen could go out with Rigby/say it was just a hang out thing to convince him 
* Brain Eraser - Mordecai mentions Margaret once had a giant boyfriend 
And then in Camping Can Be Cool, she says she’s taking a break from dating because “guys are jerks”. While true Margaret did date a few guys, I don’t think this is something to hold over her, nor is it as big a deal as some fans make it out to be. Margaret’s in her early 20s, dating is something many people her age do. She seemed to realize a pattern with guys she was dating too and decided to take a break. Other male characters in the show have also been seen dating/cozying up to different women every other episode. 

Mordecai is also not entitled to have Margaret. It’s not her fault he never took the many chances he had to ask her out/kiss her. By season three it’s even pretty obvious shes into him too but he still refuses to make a move due to his own insecurities and “wanting the moment to be right”. She can’t just wait around for him, and she even said anytime she thinks they’re getting close he throws her for a loop.

Is Margaret one of my favorite characters? Idk Probably not. While I went back and forth as a tween/teen when the show was airing, I’m now firmly a CJ fan in regards to Mordecai’s love interests, she honestly appeals to me more both personality and design wise, her cloud deisgn and hurricane powers are unique, Linda Cardelinni does a great job voicing her, and I loved the chemistry she and Mordecai, and them alongside Rigby/Eileen had, some of my favorite episodes from seasons 5-6 involve them.

That’s not to say there aren’t aspects of Margaret I do enjoy. She’s a down to earth nice person, which can be appreciated among a cast of more out there characters, and the one thing I do think she has over CJ development wise is that we know what else went on with her life outside of hanging around Mordecai. Besides her family life and her job at the coffee shop we learn about how she’s studying at community college and trying to transfer to university so she can work in journalism and quit her waitressing job. She even reveals to Mordecai her fears that come with trying to get into college, worrying that she hasn’t heard back or that she sounded dumb in her interviews. With CJ we do get a glimpse of her childhood with how her mini gold pro dad taught her the sport but was a huge jerk about it, although we don’t really know much about her past or what she does outside of hanging with the other characters , hell we didn’t even know what her job was until the season 7 finale where we see her as a city tour guide for kids. 

Overall, Margaret’s fine lol. CJ and Eileen still best girls tho",1,1751909711.0,regularshow,2,0.67,False

Hey everyone!

I’m a software engineer working remotely from Varanasi for the past couple of years. While WFH definitely has its perks (no traffic, flexible hours, chai whenever I want 😄), the social side of life has taken a massive hit. The office small talk, random coffee breaks, weekend hangouts—all gone.

Lately, it's just been work, eat, scroll, sleep, repeat. Starting to feel like a character in a simulation 😬

So here I am, putting myself out there! Would love to:

Meet fellow remote workers or locals in tech

Explore the city more (temples, ghats, hidden cafes—I'm in!)

Grab a coffee, chai, or even just go for a walk and chat

Maybe collaborate on a side project if you're into coding/startups

Or just share memes, music, books, or whatever gets us through the day

If you're in Varanasi (or even nearby) and feeling even a little bit of the same WFH fatigue, drop a comment or DM. Let’s build a little circle of humans who remember what talking to other humans feels like 😅

P.S. Not just limited to tech folks—if you're into art, writing, photography, or just vibing, I'd love to connect.",1,1751909705.0,BHU,0,1.0,False

* **Winery with a view** \- [Paradise Ridge Winery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uJKFru8ZrtPPjq2MA) in Santa Rosa. Checked out their sculpture gardens and the view atop their winery. Winery was closed, will go back another time. 
* **Wine Tasing (for real)** \- [Siduri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FFebV17kCpsWHoH5A) in Healdsburg for their Pinot Noirs (looked up Reddit for good pinot noir wine spots). Event though they were busy, the host (Wolfgang) showed great hospitality and set up a wonderful tasting experience for us!
* **Dessert before dinner** \- Had some really good chocolate ice cream and coconut mousse pie at the [Noble Folk Ice Cream & Pie Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kw8UumfqacSwcixy7) 
* **Stay** \- [Thatcher Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/suDeAVqnYrUTgN7V8) in Hopland is a wonderful spot to stay and also break your journey if you are headed to Mendocino. Check the pics, you'll see. 
* **Dinner & beer** \- [Ukiah Brewing Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q5NYCbwKWTrqE8meA)

**Day 2 (Sat)** \- Drove from Hopland to Fort Bragg, then to Mendocino and back to Hopland. 101-North, CA-20, CA-1 and CA-128. 

* **Quick breakfast** \- Poppy Cafe at the Thatcher Hotel. 
* **Lunch** \- Had a good flight of sour beers and an interesting cocktail with bourbon and their Scrimshaw beer at [The Pub at North Coast Brewing Co](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uHPbE4U5X6z7whXw6) with lunch. 
* **Dessert before dinner (always)** \- Walked a few miles from the Glass Beach to Compass Rose and stopped at [Cowlick's Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pYTXehxEvMyyaZh39). The line was long (always!) so we decided to skip the line and get their half a pint portion of ice cream (worth it!). 
* **Driving along the coast** \- Drove to Mendocino and stopped at [Point Cabrillo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RcVNg9owDxznst429) first for a quick walk to the lighthouse, and then in Mendocino town. Lots of walking trails along the coast here, and a kayaking activity as well. 
* **Dinner** \- Vegan for dinner (one of us is a vegetarian, and both of us love yummy food) so decided to stop at [Fog Eater Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qCLrr7icB97rFcS36) for a sumptuous dinner and a nice garden vibe. They serve a korean rice beer (Makku) that you should try out!  
* **River to the Ocean highlight** \- Drove back to Hopland first along the Pacific Coast Highway and then CA-128. There is a [point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fqTqPMFZAQDbv2BB7) along the route between PCH and 128, where you'll see the mouth of the Navarro River as it flows into the Pacific Ocean. It's also a camping spot. 
* **Driving on CA 128 after sunset** \- Be careful of wildlife crossing or standing by the side of the road. We saw a number of deers at various points along the drive that night.

**Day 3 (Sun)** \- Drove back to Sunnyvale, via Geyserville and Berkeley 

* **Brunch -** Checked out of the hotel at 11am, and drove to [Fermata Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/izKq1XTy6uhqHfSo9) in Geyserville. Good coffee and bruch with avocado toast and the classic breakfast sandwich. 
* **Chai** \- Finally got to check out [Elaichi Co](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5g1mym29o3ecesxE9) (tea/chai spot) in Berkeley. Even though it was not packed with people, there was no space to sit and enjoy the tea, because of their layout and furniture choices (this is my opinion alone). Tea was good, but I would have loved to sip it with some pastry too. I have ideas on how to make more with the space they already have; can catch up over some karak chai :) 
* **Late Lunch (early dinner #1?)** \- [Zareen's Mountain View](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQerMrKNk96tSSvT7) for their forever-yummy Silver Spoon Paratha rolls (paneer tikka and chicken boti FTW!) before heading to the movies next door to watch F1 (loved it!)

I went down a rabbit hole of downloading 932 apps, hoping something would “fix” me. Uninstalled most, but a few actually helped. Not saying they changed my life, but they did help me get a little unstuck. Sharing in case anyone else needs this:

Notion - good for day planning & organizing thoughts. Plus feels so satisfying to check stuff off.
Jolt - helped me reduce screen time without feeling attacked by pushy reminders lol and soft language.
Lifestack - lowkey solved half my probs. It links to your devices + tracks energy levels so you can plan based on how fried your brain is. I loved that I could rest without guilt
Todoist- great for priority-based planning. I use it when I wanna feel like I have my life together.
Google Calendar- basic but underrated. I use it to remember everything from b’days to assignment deadlines.

And plsbefore anyone comes at methis isn’t an ad. I’m just tired of feeling like I’m failing every day, and if this helps even one person out of the loop, it’s worth sharing.

If y’all have any other app recs or hacks that actually work, drop ‘em. Or just relate. That’s cool too 🫶

I graduated from university a year and a half ago, followed by a period of international volunteering. After that, I earned my PMP certification—but since then, I’ve found myself in a bit of a rut.

For the past six months, I’ve been working as a barista because I haven’t been able to find a job in my field (humanitarian aid). It’s a highly competitive sector, with frequent budget cuts and limited entry opportunities. While I’m still passionate about pursuing a career in this area, I’ve come to realize that it’s just as important to gain practical experience aligned with my PMP certification—so I can break this cycle and move toward a more fulfilling path than making coffee for others.

Right now, I’m feeling a bit lost about where to begin, and I also feel the pressure of needing to log PDU hours to maintain my certification.

I would truly appreciate any advice on what types of jobs or sectors might be good to explore so I can get back on track, and to get the PDU hours. Thank you so much!

Hey everyone!

I’m a software engineer working remotely from Varanasi for the past couple of years. While WFH definitely has its perks (no traffic, flexible hours, chai whenever I want 😄), the social side of life has taken a massive hit. The office small talk, random coffee breaks, weekend hangouts—all gone.

Lately, it's just been work, eat, scroll, sleep, repeat. Starting to feel like a character in a simulation 😬

So here I am, putting myself out there! Would love to:

Meet fellow remote workers or locals in tech

Explore the city more (temples, ghats, hidden cafes—I'm in!)

Grab a coffee, chai, or even just go for a walk and chat

Maybe collaborate on a side project if you're into coding/startups

Or just share memes, music, books, or whatever gets us through the day

If you're in Varanasi (or even nearby) and feeling even a little bit of the same WFH fatigue, drop a comment or DM. Let’s build a little circle of humans who remember what talking to other humans feels like 😅

My entire property was basically all invasives when I moved it, and I've pulled so much out and replaced it with natives and I've felt really good about what I've been able to accomplish in just two years. There is still a lot to do, but I began this spring with tons of gusto and optimism. I was pulling every single ditch lily bulb out and spending all my money on natives at the local nursery. I knew it was only one corner of the earth but it felt like I was making a difference here.

Fast forward to now, early July, and I feel suddenly overwhelmed and exhausted. I just got back from a week away and everything looks like a disaster. Raccoons wreaked havoc while I was gone and ate all my just-bloomed cornflowers and many of my violets (as well as broke into a box of coffee that had been delivered, punched a whole in the screen porch, and this morning raided the nest of newly-hatched Eastern Phoebes outside my window and killed them all). I know the garden is for the wildlife, at least in part, but I was hoping the pollinators (and I) could enjoy it for a while. I have invasives popping up all over, as always, including the first I've seen of the dreaded Japanese stilt grass. And the neighbor's oriental bittersweet continues it's persistent creep over the property line. Oh and the ditch lilies! I swear they quadrupled while I was gone. What felt a month or so ago like progress now feels totally overwhelming and pointless. 

Adding to that -- and forgive me if this is inappropriate for this sub -- but given the legislation that is passing here in the States, especially as it relates to renewables and conservation, I just feel so disheartened and like my little effort is meaningless. Why dig out by hand single ditch lilies when we're just basically lighting the entire planet on fire?

In short, I'm battling a major case of the fuck-its. I could use some inspiration and/or some empathy. What are you struggling with? What gets you down and how do you keep going? Do you go through phases and find a way to push through or do you sometimes give yourself permission to step away and regroup. Often the garden brings me peace but right now it feels like it's bringing me down. 

Forgive my whining. I'm a little embarrassed. But surely others feel this, too, right?

1lu0d09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lu0d09/its_supposed_to_be_my_wedding/,It’s supposed to be MY wedding…,"I always imagined the night I got engaged would be perfect.  
You know—candles, maybe a cheesy speech, a little happy cry, and a “yes” whispered against his lips. And it was. Jason got down on one knee at our favorite Italian place and asked me to marry him with the same grin he gave me when we first met. I cried. He kissed me. The restaurant clapped. It was perfect.

Then we told his mother.

And everything after that has felt like a slow, crawling descent into satin-lined hell.

From the moment I showed her the ring—my ring—she tilted her head like she was confused and said,  
“Oh… it’s sweet. A bit… modest, isn’t it? But that’s okay, dear. You’re a simple girl.”

Simple.

Not classy. Not elegant. Simple.

That was the first jab. I brushed it off. I’d promised myself I wouldn’t turn into one of those brides who fights with the mother-in-law. I was going to be mature. Calm. A glowing vision of grace.

By the second week, I was googling “Can you ban someone from a wedding if they’re technically family?”

The next time she saw me, she handed me a folder full of wedding ideas she liked. She had already booked a venue for a “wedding planning consultation” without telling me. It was a ballroom straight out of a 1987 soap opera—mirrored ceilings, gold everything, and the words “Live. Laugh. Love.” carved into a fountain.

“Oh, I just assumed you didn’t have anything planned yet,” she said, with that same smug fake smile she wears like a badge of honor. “I know your family doesn’t really… do events like this.”

Translation: You're not classy enough to pull this off.

And then there’s her daughter. My future sister-in-law, Lindsey.

God. Lindsey.

If Jason’s mom is the mastermind, Lindsey is her evil little minion. She repeats every opinion her mother has like she’s getting paid for it.

When I picked a blush-toned bridesmaid dress for the girls, Lindsey raised her eyebrows and said,  
“Do you think this color is… flattering? On all body types? It might wash me out. I mean… I can wear it, but I think Mom was thinking more jewel tones.”

Mom. Mom. Mom.

She says “Mom” like she’s her boss, stylist, and cult leader all in one.

And Jason? He’s trying. I know he is. But the man’s spine goes missing every time his mother sighs.

I don’t want to be “that bride.”  
But today, after the third phone call where his mother referred to the wedding as “our event”, I locked myself in the bathroom and screamed into a towel for a solid five minutes.

I am marrying the man I love.

And also apparently gaining a package deal from Satan’s own sorority.

And this wedding?  
This wedding is going to be perfect.  
Even if I have to smile through gritted teeth all the way down the aisle.

I woke up this morning determined to have a good day.

The sun was out. My dress fitting was scheduled. Jason made coffee the way I like it. Today will be good, I told myself. Today, I will smile and sip overpriced espresso and talk about peonies like I’m not one stress hiccup away from an emotional collapse.

Then my phone buzzed.

MIL-From-Hell (saved as “Jason’s Mom 🙄”) 

 “Sweetheart, I went ahead and confirmed the cake tasting appointment for today. Hope you don’t mind! Lindsey’s joining too. 💗”

I hadn’t even finished brushing my teeth.

Let me pause here and explain: this woman rescheduled the appointment behind my back. I had booked it a month ago—with a bakery I loved, a Black-owned small business that made wedding cakes look like edible art. But nooo. Apparently, she “didn’t vibe with their energy.” Whatever that means.

So now we were heading to her pick—a place that looked like Pinterest threw up inside a tea room.

Jason offered to come with me, bless his naïve heart. I told him to stay home. He looked relieved. Coward.

We walk into the bakery and I’m hit with the smell of overly sugared fondant and tension.

“Oh good, you’re not late!” his mom chirps, giving me a once-over like I wore pajamas (I didn’t). “Lindsey’s already inside picking her favorites!”

Her favorites.

The sister-in-law who isn’t even in the wedding party anymore because she “wasn’t sure she could commit to the rehearsal.” Yeah. That Lindsey.

I sit down, fold my hands, and smile like a Stepford Wife with a revenge plot.

The server brings out samples. Red velvet. Vanilla bean. Lemon raspberry.

I try the lemon. It’s divine—light, sweet, perfectly tart.

But before I can even say a word, Lindsey makes a face like she just licked a battery.

“Ugh. It tastes weirdly sour, doesn’t it, Mom?”

Jason’s mom dabs the corner of her mouth with a napkin and nods.  
“I was thinking something safer. Like chocolate. Everyone likes chocolate.”

I blink. “We can still do chocolate for the groom’s cake. But the lemon raspberry was—”

“Jason’s not really a lemon guy,” she interrupts.  
“He actually told me once that it reminded him of dish soap.”

I nearly choke.

“He… eats dish soap?” I ask flatly.

She laughs like I made a joke. I didn’t.

Lindsey jumps in: “I actually love the chocolate hazelnut one. It’s sooo elegant. And romantic.”  
She bats her lashes.  
At me.  
Like I’m the extra guest here.

I take a slow breath, channeling every ounce of yoga I’ve never done in my life.

“I’ll think about it,” I say sweetly. “But ultimately, it’s my decision.”

They both blink. Like I just said a curse word.

His mom leans forward with that fake pity smile. “Of course, honey. But it would be such a shame if your guests didn’t enjoy something so… niche.”

Niche?!

It’s cake. Not foie gras.

I smiled. I stood. I thanked the server. And then I excused myself to the bathroom and texted Jason three words:

“I’m. Losing. It.”

We’re 82 days away from the wedding.  
82 days of opinions, sabotage, and backhanded compliments.  
I don’t know how much more I can take.

But one thing’s for sure:  
If I survive this, I’m putting “lemon raspberry” on everything.  
Out of spite.  
Out of principle.

And if anyone complains?

I’ll just smile.

Like a bride.

Like a woman who’s about to burn the whole reception to the ground.

The bridal shower was supposed to be a sweet little afternoon with my closest friends and family—flowers, finger sandwiches, maybe some awkward but heartfelt toasts. Instead, it turned into the “Mother-in-Law and Daughter-In-Law Show,” starring the two worst villains in my wedding story.

Of course, they made sure to RSVP early and show up fashionably early, too—because they wanted to “set the tone.” Lindsey was wearing a dress two sizes too small, and Mom had on one of those look at me hats that practically screamed, I’m the real bride here.

The whole room felt tense, like everyone was waiting for the next jab. And jab they did.

Lindsey made a big show of rearranging the gift table—my gift table—because apparently, “presentation matters.” Mom kept whispering pointed comments about my choice of caterer and how “homemade cupcakes” just weren’t elegant enough.

I smiled through it all, counting down the minutes until I could escape.

But the real nightmare hit later.

At the wedding rehearsal dinner, Lindsey cornered me with a smirk that made my skin crawl.

“Hey, just so you know, Mom and I took care of the seating chart,” she said sweetly. “We made sure the right people are sitting near the head table.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Oh? And who exactly did you decide should be seated there?”

She smiled bigger. “Oh, just a few special guests who might… cause some drama. Nothing too serious.”

I had no idea what she meant, but a sinking feeling settled in my stomach.

The next day at the wedding, it all exploded.

During the speeches, one of the “special” guests—an ex of Jason’s who was still clearly holding a grudge—stood up and made a pointed, humiliating comment about me. The entire room fell silent. Jason looked horrified. And I wanted to disappear.

When I confronted Lindsey afterward, demanding to know who set this up, she broke down crying.

“It was Mom,” she sobbed. “She said it would be funny, that it would finally show you who’s really in charge.”

My blood boiled.

I turned to his mother, who was pretending to sip champagne like nothing was happening.

“That’s it,” I snapped. “I’m done. You’re not welcome here anymore. You and your games. We’re done.”

She blinked, shocked, but I didn’t care.

From that moment on, there was a wall between us. No calls. No texts. No pretending.

Because sometimes, love means cutting out the toxicity — even if it comes wrapped in family.

I'm planning a long-overdue catch-up with close friends, and we're looking for a peaceful, isolated stay surrounded by nature - somewhere we can just relax, vibe, and enjoy some privacy away from the crowd.

We're considering places like Ooty, Wayanad, Chikmagalur, or Coorg, and are open to any hidden gems or offbeat stays in these regions.

We're not looking for typical hotels or packed resorts. Instead, we'd love something like:

A secluded homestay, cottage, or cabin in the hills or amidst trees.

Total privacy - ideally with no other guests around.

Surrounded by greenery, forest, coffee estates, or hills 

Clean, peaceful, and safe

Accessible by car, but far from the noisy tourist zones

Bonus points if it has open area for chilling or maybe a campfire setup.

1lu019r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lu019r/find_out_if_the_west_bend_coffee_urn_58030_is/,Find Out if the West Bend Coffee Urn 58030 is Perfect for Your Events,"Stepping into the world of reliable coffee makers, the West Bend 58030 was my solution to fueling office meetings, family gatherings, and other caffeine-heavy events. As someone who craves high efficiency and simplicity, diving into this product felt like a practical choice for busy environments.

**Elegant Design That Stands Out**  
One of the first things I noticed about this coffee urn was its sleek, polished aluminum look. It has an almost vintage charm that doesn’t try too hard, making it suitable for placing in professional or personal settings. Measuring at 10.8 x 10.8 x 15.6 inches, it’s compact enough to store but large enough for brewing up to 30 cups in one cycle—plenty for larger groups. The stay-cool base and lockable cover consistently felt like thoughtful touches while handling, especially when trying to avoid spills during busy gatherings.

**Consistent and Convenient Brewing Performance**  
This is where the coffee urn begins to shine. Brewing a cup per minute sounds like a minor detail, but when you’re hosting a hungry crowd waiting for coffee, that efficiency counts. The fact that it switches to a keep-warm mode automatically after brewing feels like a lifesaver. I left it running during long brunches, and it maintained coffee at the perfect temperature. Bonus points for the ready light that takes the guesswork out of operation—it’s as simple and user-friendly as I could have hoped for!

[Ready to buy West Bend 58030? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b00008iha1/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Quick brewing: One cup per minute ensures minimal downtime.  
- Excellent temperature control keeps coffee warm without burning it.  
- The no-drip spigot delivers mess-free dispensing, saving cleanup time.  

**Sturdiness and Build Quality**  
At just 4.1 pounds, the coffee urn felt lightweight yet durable. The reusable filter/basket system eliminates the need for disposable filters, adding an eco-friendly touch. While the manual design makes it simple to operate, the polished aluminum feels easy enough to clean after extended use. This is especially valuable for me because cleaning coffee makers often turns into a dreaded chore.

**Suitability For Various Users**  
Whether hosting office events or casual brunches at home, this coffee urn seems to slot into a wide range of activities. However, it’s clearly designed for light-duty use. If you’re planning to use it in a heavy-duty or commercial environment, it might not keep up with the daily grind—pun intended! For home or small workplace settings, though, it does its job marvelously.

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited to smaller gatherings: Designed more for home or light office use, not commercial-heavy operations.  
- The aluminum finish feels slightly prone to smudges, requiring regular wiping to maintain its polished look.  

**Competing Products**  
Having tried a few other coffee urns, I’d compare it closely to the Hamilton Beach 40540 and the Nesco CU-30. Where the West Bend 58030 shines is in its stylish yet minimalistic design and user-friendliness. The Nesco CU-30 does impress with its stainless steel build, giving it an edge in durability, and the Hamilton Beach model offers a two-way dispenser for added versatility. Still, West Bend holds its ground with its efficient brewing speed and practical temperature management.

**Smart Spending Decision?**  
In terms of value, the coffee urn provides a reasonable balance of price and features. Its ease of use, combined with its steady performance, makes it a practical investment for anyone hosting medium-sized crowds. It may not boast the most extravagant features on the market, but for everyday brewing that’s both reliable and efficient, it’s a strong contender.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

❄️🦾Public reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

I would love to buy a bullet, but like my wife would be ultra pissed if I spent 3-4k on a coffee bean roaster.    
  
For the roasters that seem to have these features in the \~500 to \~1500 space, (Skywalker V2, KALEIDO Sniper M, HotTop KN-8828B-2K+) there aren't any fluid bed roasters, they're all drum roasters.  

Does anyone know of Fluid Bed Roasters that do have these features which aren't over 2 grand, and can do at least 300g of coffee at a time?

Some of those sample roasters seem great, but like, 50-150g of coffee per roast isn't going to cut it, I'd have to roast coffee twice a day to keep up with my family's consumption. ",2,1751908197.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Lunch: *colorful tagliatelle with fruity tomato sauce, grated hard cheese and vanilla pudding* 5/10 
 The sauce was a little too sweet, tasted like a sauce for children from a jar that has way too much sugar in it. I was a little nauseous after eating the pasta, so the pudding wouldn't have been a good idea (I'm lactose intolerant as well). My roommate's visitor took it home, so nothing was wasted.

Coffee/tea time: *rosehip tea, factory Madeleine and cookies with some fake flavoring in them (I had them before in this hospital)* 6/10 for the tea, didn't touch the rest. They had cheesecake, plum cake and apple cake, but I'm on the ""easy to digest"" diet and my only option would've been cheesecake. Not easily digestible for lactose intolerant people 😬 I asked if they had cookies instead, got what you see, and the orderly was gone before I could say anything.

Dinner: *tomato soup, butter, 2 slices of cheese and bread that I brought in myself* 8/10 the soup really hit the spot! I wanted some veggies as well, but wasn't allowed because of the diet they have me on 😕

I had surgery to repair my umbilical hernia this morning. So far, I only know that it was successful, haven't seen a doctor who can tell me any details yet. I'm in a lot of pain and every movement makes it a lot worse. I couldn't eat my meals sitting up, it was too painful. The IV they put in before the surgery hurt from the very beginning, which is a bad sign. Getting my evening pain meds through it was agony and I realized that my hand and arm were super swollen, I could barely move my fingers anymore. So I finally got the IV pulled and I'm icing my hand and arm right now.

I also had a great talk with a dietitian! The last time I've been to this hospital I ate pasta with tomato sauce pretty much every day because I'm allergic to almost all of their vegetarian options. I told that to a nurse yesterday and now I'll actually get nutritious food according to my dietary restrictions, yay! I hope the food is actually as good as it sounded, we'll see.

1ltzq24,https://www.reddit.com/r/writersanonymus/comments/1ltzq24/just_two_strangers/,Just two strangers,"You came up to me,  
Hangin by the beach,  
Asked to take my picture,  
Like the universe needed a reason,  
For us to collide.  

One month.  
That’s all it took,  
For you to crawl under my skin,  
And make a home of my every heartbeat.  
We were inseparable,  
Sunrise to long past midnight,  
Each moment stitched together,  
With laughter,  
With wanting,  
With that dizzy,  
Early kind of love.  

And then,  
Just like that,  
You vanished.  
Switched it all off,  
Like I was a light you no longer needed.  
No anger, no explosion,  
Just absence.  
Like we were strangers,  
Who had only passed,  
On a street neither of us could find again.  

You went far.  
Three years of oceans,  
Mountains,  
Time zones,  
And I stayed.  
Not in place,  
But in hope.  
Always waiting for the day,  
I could hold you again.  
Not knowing,  
If you even remembered my name.

And then,  
You did.  
We talked.  
We laughed.  
We healed the silence with soft words,  
And slow visits.  
Then one day,  
Your toothbrush sat next to mine.  
And love came back in full color.  
You said “YES!”,  
With a ring on your finger,  
And I thought…  
Maybe we’re done being strangers.  

But love is fragile,  
And I made mistakes.  
Too much work.  
Too little presence.  
And you…  
You started slipping away again,  
Quietly,  
At first.  
Then I cast a final blow,  
And you ended us.  

That feeling again,  
Silence,  
While making coffee,  
While folding laundry,  
While hiding your eyes.  
And I felt it,  
That old cruel distance,  
Returning like a storm I couldn’t stop.  
Even your body forgot me.  
You covered yourself,  
Like I hadn’t kissed every inch,  
A thousand times.  

And now,  
we are what we’ve always been.  
Strangers.  
Strangers who once danced barefoot  
in the kitchen,  
and whispered about forever.  
Strangers who swore,  
we’d never be.  

But I see it now.  
We were always strangers,  
because no matter how close we pressed,  
no matter how deep the love,  
life is lived alone.  
You can’t crawl into someone’s mind,  
and stay.  
You can only visit,  
and hope they leave the door unlocked.  

Still,  
if the world spins us together again,  
as it has before,  
I will love you as a stranger,  
without asking you to be anything else.  
Because maybe,  
that’s the only way,  
love ever really lasts.  ",2,1751907952.0,writersanonymus,1,1.0,False

That changed when I very kindly asked my SS wife to watch the children more closely because they have broken several of my things already, one of them is a large furniture piece that is valuable.  I already removed many of important-to-me things from my common living areas before they moved in, my master bedroom is stuffed with those things, but I expected my SS and his wife to be able to watch the children and teach them not to destroy my furniture.  Instead they allow them to use my living room sectional couch, coffee tables and chairs as a jungle gym.  SS wife doesn’t take them outdoors during the day because we are in the middle of summer in the south, so I understand that, but we also bought them a large inflatable water park thing in anticipation for the heat however she doesn’t let them play unless SS is home too.  The children are wild and loud.  Honestly she alternates all day between sitting outside on her phone smoking where she cannot see them or sitting on the couch on her phone, not paying much attention to them.  We have Ring cameras that record everything, everyone in the house knows this.  There is a child sized handprint on a large, heavy antique mirror hanging behind my couch.  The only way for them to reach it would be to stand on the glass topped couch table beneath it.  I’m telling you, I cringe when I think of what could have happened if the glass had broken.  We purchased several digital fingerprint door locks because the children were going in to my pantry and climbing up the shelves to the top of the 9 ft ceiling, were jumping in my new washing machine (which makes a grinding sound at the end of spin cycle now) and also escaping outside unsupervised.

We live on an 8 acres homestead farm that must be managed daily due to we are in the middle of harvest season and have livestock, chickens, bees too.  My DH and I both work full time as well.  These adult kids do nothing to help our homestead, they don’t pay anything to live with us and they don’t help with the garden or property, they don’t cook for themselves or anyone else, the children eat snacks all day and then they will eat out every night now that I am no longer cooking.  The only thing they will do late in the evening is pick up the absolute wreck the children make every day in all my common living/kitchen areas and SS wife cleans the bathroom and the one large bedroom they all have to share at the moment.  SS wife is a SAHM.

When my DH and I asked my SS wife to manage the children more closely, and also offered to help!, she got very upset and stonewalled us for days and my SS was very aggressively defending her, which is out of character for him, he is a very jovial person.  It’s the most bizarre thing I’ve been through, stonewalling is such an abrupt and confusing narcistic abuse tactic.  I now see her on my Ring camera, lying to SS about me being the problem, trying very hard to deflect because she refuses to be held accountable to watch the children.  It really hurt my feelings for a couple of weeks but now I am just mad and done with these freeloaders who feel so entitled to abuse and disrespect me in my own home.  My DH feels trapped because he also sees what is happening, is on my side, but is reluctant to kick them out because we both love the grandchildren so much.  We have set up our property with many fun kid things like a trampoline, seesaw, large sandbox, trails etc. We are putting in a pool now.  All this so that our grandchildren will love to come to Granna and Grampy's house!  She will absolutely keep them from us if she feels attacked.  She  has done that with other family members for perceived slights that are not valid but I've never said so to her.  She may already withhold them when they finally leave so it may not even matter but neither of us wants to take a chance to lose the grandchildren to her unreasonable tantrums.  The stonewalling, narcissistic abuse worked I guess.

So we actually both feel trapped to put up with their behavior until they move out in order to salvage the relationship as much as possible for the sake of the children.  It really sucks, I thought they loved and respected us more than this, it really seemed so.

At least DH and I are agreed that they are never welcome to live with us, for any reason, ever again.           ",5,1751907734.0,stepparents,2,1.0,False

I (39M, Virgo Sun, Aries Moon, Taurus Ascending) had a first date with a cap man a week ago. Nothing fancy just a coffee date but we got on really, joking, prolonged eye contact laughing. I realised how amazing, hard working and charismatic he is. 

Yesterday we had our second date; I cooked for him at my place and he took me to what he called a secret swimming spot. We swam together and chatted for a long time until the sunset, and both opened up about pretty personal things. We have the same weird sense of humour. But no kissing, no romantic touching.

At times it felt like he's showing off, also mentioned other people he's currently dating which was a little bit off-putting and called the evening a ""non-date"".

When cycling back and going home separately he was gauging my availability for the upcoming days. Then messaged me saying that he's developing ""semiplatonic feelings"" for me.

My own journey began at Bahrain Financial Harbour, nervously clutching a folder of documents, wondering if I’d miss a stamp or signature. That day, a local consultant handed me a card and whispered, “Timing is everything. Go after 1:30pm and you’ll avoid the lunch rush.” He was right. That simple tip cut my waiting time in half and taught me—the best company formation advice in Bahrain always comes from those who’ve done it themselves.

Feature Image: Corporate professionals discussing company formation in a modern office *Alt text: Corporate professionals discussing company formation in a modern office.* that Bahrain climbed into the top 50 of their “Best Countries for Business” index, thanks to friendlier regulations and agile digital government systems like Sijilat. Meanwhile, [Reuters economic coverage](https://www.reuters.com/) highlights Bahrain’s non-oil economic growth, now projected at 4.2% for 2025, with FinTech, logistics, and tourism as leading sectors. The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) continues to attract record FDI, especially given the 99% foreign ownership across most commercial sectors ([details](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)).

But—unlike the UAE, where high minimum capital and costly trade licenses are the norm, Bahrain remains cost-friendly, with low official fees and minimal paid-up capital most sectors. That’s partly why I’ve stayed for over a decade.

# What Drives Professional Service Fees in Bahrain Company Formation?

There’s no single “standard fee” for forming a company in Bahrain—costs depend on your entity type, business activity, shareholding structure, and where you need support. Professional service fees can include:

* *Consultation and advisory*
* *Commercial registration (CR) facilitation*
* *Document preparation and translations*
* *Government liaison and follow-up*
* *Registered office/virtual address setup*
* *Local sponsorship or nominee support*
* *Ongoing compliance, accounting, and renewals*

Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration: Team reviewing documents for new company registration *Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Team reviewing documents for new company registration.*

* **Company Formation Advisor Fees:** Typically **BHD 350 – BHD 1200** depending on entity complexity and inclusions
   * *Basic packages with document review/recommendations start at BHD 350*
   * *Full-service (including CR processing and government liaison) generally BHD 700 – 1,200*
* **Legal Document Fees/Translations:** *BHD 50 – BHD 200* (per document or set)
* **Registered Office/Virtual Address:** *BHD 100 – BHD 500* per year
* **Local Sponsorship (if required for certain sectors):** *BHD 1,000+* (see [sponsorship details](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/))
* **Ongoing Compliance (accounting, renewal, VAT):** *BHD 150 – BHD 500+* per month ([bookkeeping options](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/))

For a detailed update and cost calculator, refer to [KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation cost page](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

# Typical All-In Cost (2025 Example)

*For a standard WLL (LLC) setup in Seef or Diplomatic Area:*

|Service Component|Typical Fee (BHD)|
|:-|:-|
|Professional Formation Fee|700|
|Legal Document Drafting/Notary|150|
|Sijilat Commercial Registration|250|
|Registered Address|150|
|MOICT License Fees|100 – 500|
|LMRA Pre-Approval (if hiring)|30|
|Virtual Office (optional)|200|
|**Expected Total**|**1,380 – 1,980**|

*This estimate excludes share capital (usually* ***BHD 50 – 1,000+*** *depending on activity) and optional add-ons like visa sponsorship, which can increase outlay.*

# Step-by-Step: Bahrain Company Formation (Including Insider Tips)

# 1. Choose the Right Structure

Before you even start with Sijilat, nail down your entity type. The most popular are:

* **WLL (With Limited Liability):** Flexible, suits most commercial activities
* **SPC (Single Person Company):** Solo entrepreneur, 100% ownership
* **Foreign Branch:** For established overseas firms
* **BSC Closed/Open:** Larger, capital-heavy companies or listings
* **Free Zone Entity:** If aiming for 100% foreign ownership in select sectors ([see free zone details](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/))

Review detailed [Bahrain business type structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) for side-by-side comparisons.

A mistake I made early on: not reading the fine print on “activity codes.” The description you choose in Sijilat for your CR needs to match your actual business plans, or you might face fines or have to redo your approval. Always double-check with a seasoned advisor.

# 2. Engage a Professional Service Provider Early

The right local advisor saves countless hours. My best results came from firms with in-house Arabic speakers (critical for MOICT and Sijilat) located near major government complexes in Seef or the Diplomatic Area. Choose a provider who:

* Can book or hold your Sijilat queue spot
* Knows when government offices are less crowded (post-lunch or midweek)
* Pre-checks your documents to avoid rejection
* Provides templates for board resolutions and formation documents
* Offers real-time CR status updates

# 3. Prepare Key Documents

Have these ready before your first CR appointment to cut delays:

* **Passport copies of shareholders/directors**
* **Proof of address** (for shareholders and registered office)
* **Draft Memorandum of Association**
* **Business activity summary** (fitting Sijilat coding)
* **Board resolution (for branches or multiple directors)**
* **Power of attorney (if engaging local agent)**

*Ramadan tip: Government hours shift; aim for early mornings or right after Asr prayers to avoid bottlenecks.*

Feature Image: Business process and documentation for company setup in Bahrain *Alt text: Business process and documentation for company setup in Bahrain.*, but in-person submission can speed tricky cases (especially if your business falls under regulated sectors: banking, healthcare, education).

* *Follow up directly with MOICT officers for status updates*

*(Personal aside: I once waited three weeks for a CR update—turns out my file was missing a translated activity summary. My advisor caught it during a routine follow-up and solved it same-day. A professional’s inside connections really do matter.)*

# 5. Pay Government and Professional Fees

Here’s where transparent pricing matters most. Insist on a breakdown of:

* *Official MOICT, Sijilat, and EDB charges*
* *Professional/advisory fees (fixed vs. hourly)*
* *Document translation and legalization*
* *Registered address cost (annual or monthly)*

Negotiate combined packages for multiple services—most reputable Bahraini agents offer bundled discounts.

# 6. Complete Post-Formation Steps

*Activate your bank account* (most local banks require your full CR, board resolutions, and personal visit from the signatory).

*Register with LMRA* if hiring staff, and set up your Tamkeen support if eligible.

*Set up monthly/quarterly compliance* ([details](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)).

*Renew your CR and licenses* on schedule—Bahrain fines for late renewals can be steep.

# Detailed Breakdown: Where Professional Fees Go

Feature Image: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain company setup *Alt text: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain company setup.*:\*\* Covers eligibility, activity matching, ownership structure, and roadmapping

* **Document Preparation:** Drafting and Arabic/English translation of incorporation contracts, board resolutions, powers of attorney
* **CR Application and Sijilat Handling:** Inputting data, uploading evidence, government follow-up
* **Physical Office Arrangements:** Lease negotiation (short-term for address purposes), virtual office setup
* **Government Liaison:** Queue booking, personal attendance for in-person queries, status tracking, and troubleshooting
* **Local Sponsorship (if mandated):** Acting as a nominee or official Bahraini partner for sectors with foreign shareholding limits (much less common as of the 2025 liberalizations)
* **Post-setup Support:** Bank account assistance, LMRA/Tamkeen setup, compliance reminders

# What Can Push Fees Higher?

* *Regulated Activities:* Need extra clearances (banking, insurance—expect additional 40-100% on base fees)
* *Multiple Shareholders/Complex Structure:* More translation, more notarizations, more compliance steps
* *Physical office space requirement:* Prime locations (Bahrain Bay, Seef) command higher rent for registered address
* *Urgency/premium processing requests:* Can add 10-30% for 24-48 hour service

And yes—if you wait until the last week of a fiscal quarter, expect government backlog and rush surcharges from both officials and service providers.

# What Changed in 2025? Key Updates Affecting Formation Costs

# Regulatory Change: Introduction of Digital eCR Endorsement

As of January 1, 2025, MOICT requires all new company registrations to submit digitally notarized eCR documents—a move aimed at reducing stamp forgery and streamlining verification. In practical terms, this means:

* *Mandatory use of certified online notaries (fee: \~BHD 35 per document)*
* *CR issuance times down from 10 days to 3-5 days for most standard entities*
* *Reduced need for in-person ministry visits—but offline support still saves time for complex submissions*

If your provider doesn’t include digital endorsement in their fee, expect to pay extra and lose out on the main advantage of the new rules: speed.

I learned the hard way that not every notary is approved by MOICT’s digital system. Insist on a provider with pre-cleared partners.

# Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi: Cost and Service Fee Comparison

Surprisingly, Bahrain beats its bigger neighbors on setup costs and flexibility:

* **Bahrain: Typical all-in market entry cost for a foreigner (WLL/SPC):** *BHD 1,500 – 2,500*, including legal, government, and virtual office
* **Dubai (UAE):** *AED 25,000 – 40,000* (BHD 2,600 – 4,200 at 2025 rates) for similar limited liability setup, often with minimum capital
* **Riyadh (Saudi):** *SAR 20,000+* (BHD 2,000+), with mandatory local partner or agent for many activities

Where Bahrain wins:

* *Lower minimum capital requirements*
* *99%+ foreign ownership in most sectors (*[*ownership details*](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)*)*
* *Faster digital government processes*
* *No requirement for costly local agent in most cases*

Where UAE still leads:

* *Larger free zone options with instant visas*
* *Wider global brand recognition*

# Bahrain Business Culture—A Tangent That Matters

It might sound off-topic, but understanding majlis-style meetings and the importance of timing during Ramadan or Ashura can seriously affect your formation process. Once, my lawyer delayed a document signing until after iftar—even though the office was technically “open” all day. Why? Because that’s when everyone, from junior clerks to ministry directors, is most approachable. Strong relationships often form over a tiny cup of gahwa (coffee) in the lobby—business and hospitality are inseparable.

# Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

* **Choosing the Wrong Activity Code:** Leads to rejection or costly amendments. Double-check MOICT-approved activity classification with your advisor.
* **Underestimating Translation Needs:** Every core document must be validated in Arabic. Skimping on professional translation can mean months of delay.
* **Misjudging Physical Address Requirements:** Using a residential or “flex” address for certain regulated businesses will get your CR revoked. Go with a trusted business center with ministry approval.
* **Ignoring Compliance After Setup:** Annual renewal, VAT filing, and employee registration aren’t just box-ticking—miss a deadline and you risk blacklisting. Use a [trusted bookkeeper](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) or compliance service.
* **Assuming 100% Ownership Is Always Allowed:** Most sectors do allow it now ([by law](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), but a few—insurance, defense—still have restrictions.

# Expert Tools and Service Providers I Recommend

For hassle-free formation, I’ve had the best luck with firms located within walking distance of the MOICT building in Seef and business centers near Bahrain Financial Harbour. Services like [KeyLink Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/) offer clear pricing, bilingual support, and actual Bahrain-based staff (not just WhatsApp operators in other countries). Always confirm local presence and request recent client testimonials.

Feature Image: Professional business support for company setup in Bahrain *Alt text: Professional business support for company setup in Bahrain.*.

# 2. How quickly can I form a company in Bahrain with professional support?

With all documents ready and a proactive service provider, CR approval through Sijilat takes **3-7 business days** for standard activities thanks to the 2025 digital endorsement. More specialized or regulated sectors can take several weeks.

# 3. Are there monthly or annual hidden charges?

You’ll have **annual renewal fees** for your CR and commercial license (typically BHD 150-400), virtual office or physical lease, and if you outsource accounting ([see this service](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)), expect BHD 150+ per month. No surprise government “back fees” if you maintain good compliance.

# 4. Can foreigners own 100% of their company?

In nearly all sectors, **yes**—thanks to recent legislative changes. Confirm specifics for your activity at [99% foreign ownership in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/).

# 5. Where can I get an official list of required documents and procedures?

The [Bahrain.com government portal](https://www.bahrain.com/) provides the latest checklists; for step-by-step English support, see [KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation process](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) or the [commercial registration instructions](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/).

If you want your first business memory in Bahrain to be a success (not a paperwork nightmare), invest in the right support. Take the time to build real relationships over coffee. And always—absolutely always—plan your appointments to avoid government queues. That’s not just good business. That’s Bahrain business.",1,1751907715.0,companysetupbh,0,1.0,False

I was in a long term relationship that ended a few months ago and I got around to updating my instagram to reflect that in the last month. A few weeks after a guy that I used to be friends with in 4th and 5th grade reached out at like 11:30pm on a Tuesday night (we are 21 now). He said hey! I’m not sure what made me think of you but I hope you’re doing well. Say hi to your dad for me? (For context my dad was his teacher in 6th grade and his mom was the room mom for him). I responded the next morning and we chatted a bit he shared what he’s majoring in, that he’s in his last year of college but he never asked me any questions about me I had to ask him. Then out of nowhere he says he asks if I like coffee and we should meet up considering we haven’t talked since we were kids really but he followed it up with no pressure. I agreed and told him to let me know when he gets his schedule for work next week he ends it on cool I’ll let you know! Two days go by and he asks if I’ve been to this one coffee place in town I say no and we then set a date he ends it on perfect and three more days go by I text him to confirm and we meet up. The idea was we would meet after I got off work for coffee and he said we will see where the vibes take us. Well we hung out for 4 hours he hugged me when I showed up we got dinner after then walked on the trail by his house. He offered me to come in but said that his mom wouldn’t except to see me and I said oh it’s okay cuz I didn’t want to intrude. On the way back from the trail I looked at the time and I said I had to go but I said let’s take a rain check on the pictures he wanted to show me he agreed got in the car to drive me back to mine at the coffee shop and he was like wow time really flew. When I got home I texted him thank you for an amazing night and he said I love hanging tonight!! The soonest I can show you those pictures (something from school) is tomorrow or later this weekend. We agreed on tomorrow but the next morning his responses were kind of short we agreed to meet again at 5:30 but then after he agreed he then said hey, I won’t have much time tonight I would hate to make you drive out just to hang for a little. Could you do next week? I definitely wanna make it worth it you know? I said I’d like that I can’t stay out too late tonight anyway so just let me know what works for you and he said ok. He also liked the Venmo payment I sent him and set it private. 4 days of silence I broke and asked how is 4th of July was and our conversation seemed like he was not asking me anything about me again I had to ask everything.

It was a very unhealthy relationship that I did not realize was having a lot of negative effects on me.

My physical and mental health are the best they have ever been and I’ve gotten off all my antidepressants. I truly feel like a new person who is ready to start again. The issue is I havnt asked out a girl in like 12 years. Hell I havnt even looked at another woman in that context in that time, I only had eyes for my wife. That took a lot of time to unprogram, but I’m finally starting to notice women who I have an attraction to. There’s this one girl at the gym who I would like to get to know. We’ve only spoken once briefly and it was just about using gym equipment. Shes always locked in and focused at the gym and I don’t want to disrupt.

Also open to recommendations: cool cafes, public events, or even casual group hangouts. I’ve noticed that people here tend to move in groups, so breaking into social circles can feel a bit intimidating, but I’d really love to be part of something this summer.

So to preface I’m a 23M, and about a month ago I ate some pretty spicy Nashville hot chicken and had a coffee with it. after about 2 days of burning, I started PPIs and the feeling got better, although I definitely still had some pressure while I was eating. about a week after the symptoms first appeared (and about 3 days after PPI) I went drinking with my friends and was generally ok, we did things like tequila shots and lemon drops and there was no immediate burning. however the Monday after I did feel some pain, but not much. after this point I stuck to a strict diet of basically chicken thighs and rice, and experienced less and less pressure each week. I also didn’t drink any coffee after I started PPI

  
fast forward a couple of weeks and I try another beer and am fine (June 20th). I try some florastor the week after but it caused alot of terrible pain so I stopped it quickly, and also started l-glutamate and zinc, along with sucralfate before every meal. since then, I’ve had things like burgers, fries, and a Caesar salad with no pain. I plan on tapering off PPI this week and hope to go back to my normal life in about 2 weeks. This is also the first time I’ve ever had anything like this. does this seem to suggest I’m healed now? I don’t have any pain when I eat meals and have a full appetite, although still avoiding all coffee, alcohol, and anything spicy/overly greasy. ",1,1751907313.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1ltzemd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ltzemd/should_you_try_goodcups_reusable_coffee_filters/,Should You Try GoodCups Reusable Coffee Filters Review for Your Keurig Machine?,"Reusable coffee filters can be a game-changer in the daily caffeine fix routine. The **GoodCups GoodCups Reusable Filter** piqued my interest, especially as I’ve been looking for eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternatives to disposable K-cups. Testing this set turned out to be an interesting experience, and I have a lot to share, both good and not-so-good. Is this the ultimate reusable K-cup set for Keurig users? Here's my detailed take.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The build quality is what stands out the most with these reusable K-cups. Handling these little devices every morning made it clear they’ve been designed to last. Manufactured with BPA-free plastic and stainless steel micro-mesh, these filters successfully seem durable even with consistent usage. The unibody lid is a significant detail I must highlight. Several cheaper reusable filters often face issues with cracking lids, but this one’s robust construction ensures longevity. As someone who has been through the disappointment of broken lids in the past, this was refreshing.  

**Ease of Compatibility**  
Setting them up with my Keurig took no effort, which was a relief because compatibility is often an issue with reusable filters. They cater to a wide array of Keurig models, both 1.0 and 2.0 brewers, including popular series like K-Classic, K-Elite, and K-Café. While testing it across both my K-Duo and Cuisinart SS-15 machines, the fit was snug, and the brewing process seamless. However, it’s essential to note they are not compatible with newer models like K-Supreme Plus or K-Mini Plus, which might be a dealbreaker if you own these specific brewers.

[Check GoodCups GoodCups price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ch13zdh2/)  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
Coffee quality is paramount, and these don’t disappoint. Thanks to the micro-mesh technology, there’s an even flow of water through the coffee grounds, resulting in a rich aroma and taste. It's satisfying knowing that none of the coffee’s natural oils or flavors were compromised. I noticed no granules slipping through the mesh either, which speaks volumes about its filtering efficiency. With commercial-grade stainless steel, the taste remains consistent over time, unlike some alternatives that can alter flavors after repeated use.  

**Eco-Friendliness and Cost-Saving Merits**  
I appreciate the environmental benefits of these reusable K-cups. They're undeniably a better choice over single-use pods that pile up landfills. Over the weeks, I felt a sense of pride in reducing my household’s waste. Financially, I could already glimpse the long-term savings. Paired with their ability to be used thousands of times, they justify their price, helping coffee lovers switch to a more sustainable brewing habit.

**Downsides**  
- Limited compatibility with newer Keurig models, like K-Supreme Plus and K-Duo Plus, might leave some users disappointed.  
- A minor gripe I noticed was that cleaning the mesh thoroughly after brewing a fine grind of coffee requires more effort than I’d prefer. The coffee residue tends to stick a little more if left uncleaned for long.  
- During testing, I found that some users might experience slight variations in brewing strength compared to traditional single-use K-cups, which may take a few tries to adjust.  

**Set of 4 Filters: Convenience Goal Achieved**  
The package includes four K-cups, and this small detail brought a surprising advantage to my routine. My household contains coffee drinkers with various flavor preferences. Having multiple filters meant I could switch between coffee grounds without pausing to clean and reuse the same filter for every cup. Whether it was my spouse’s hazelnut brew or my dark roast, both could be brewed back-to-back seamlessly.

**Good Aspects**
- Sturdy, BPA-free unibody construction for better durability.  
- Stainless steel mesh ensures even brewing and full flavor extraction.  
- Environmentally friendly alternative to disposable pods.  
- Cost-effective over time, reducing reliance on single-use K-cups.  

**Negatives**  
- Not compatible with certain newer Keurig models.  
- Might need thorough cleaning for finer grounds.  
- Slight brewing strength adjustments required initially.  

**Market Rivals**  
In comparing this reusable filter set to other options like the Delibru Reusable K-Cups, some differences emerged. Delibru offers compatibility with more Keurig models, but its plastic quality doesn’t feel as robust as the ones from this product. Another competitor, MaxBrew, also excels in brewing efficiency but lacks the added convenience of multiple filters in one set, a feature I found extremely practical here. However, if you are someone who uses the newest Keurig machines, those alternatives may offer additional compatibility flexibility.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Factoring in overall costs, these reusable filters turn out to be a wise investment. You pay upfront for long-term convenience and environmental contribution. Compared to constantly buying single-use pods, this set definitely made me feel its value reigns supreme. It caters well to anyone brewing multiple cups each day, supporting smooth brewing transitions without repeated cleaning interruptions. While its initial price might make newcomers hesitate, you quickly recover the cost with frequent usage and avoid additional waste.

I was in a long term relationship that ended a few months ago and I got around to updating my instagram to reflect that in the last month. A few weeks after a guy that I used to be friends with in 4th and 5th grade reached out at like 11:30pm on a Tuesday night (we are 21 now). He said hey! I’m not sure what made me think of you but I hope you’re doing well. Say hi to your dad for me? (For context my dad was his teacher in 6th grade and his mom was the room mom for him). I responded the next morning and we chatted a bit he shared what he’s majoring in, that he’s in his last year of college but he never asked me any questions about me I had to ask him. Then out of nowhere he says he asks if I like coffee and we should meet up considering we haven’t talked since we were kids really but he followed it up with no pressure. I agreed and told him to let me know when he gets his schedule for work next week he ends it on cool I’ll let you know! Two days go by and he asks if I’ve been to this one coffee place in town I say no and we then set a date he ends it on perfect and three more days go by I text him to confirm and we meet up. The idea was we would meet after I got off work for coffee and he said we will see where the vibes take us. Well we hung out for 4 hours he hugged me when I showed up we got dinner after then walked on the trail by his house. He offered me to come in but said that his mom wouldn’t except to see me and I said oh it’s okay cuz I didn’t want to intrude. On the way back from the trail I looked at the time and I said I had to go but I said let’s take a rain check on the pictures he wanted to show me he agreed got in the car to drive me back to mine at the coffee shop and he was like wow time really flew. When I got home I texted him thank you for an amazing night and he said I love hanging tonight!! The soonest I can show you those pictures (something from school) is tomorrow or later this weekend. We agreed on tomorrow but the next morning his responses were kind of short we agreed to meet again at 5:30 but then after he agreed he then said hey, I won’t have much time tonight I would hate to make you drive out just to hang for a little. Could you do next week? I definitely wanna make it worth it you know? I said I’d like that I can’t stay out too late tonight anyway so just let me know what works for you and he said ok. He also liked the Venmo payment I sent him and set it private. 4 days of silence I broke and asked how is 4th of July was and our conversation seemed like he was not asking me anything about me again I had to ask everything. I asked what’s his week look like and I got uh I just work Wednesday so any other day than that. Anyone got any advice I’m stumped",1,1751907211.0,NoOverthinking,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone! Regardless of your personal opinion on the gentrification of Mexico City, we, as the moderation team, ask that you follow the subreddit's rules. Rule #3 is constantly being broken, and it's difficult to keep up, especially on a Monday morning when most of us are working. We don't care what direction the discussion takes on the subreddit, as long as the established rules are respected.



Therefore, we've added some filters and controls to the subreddit so we can end the day without everyone cursing each other, and also to help you start your week a bit less angry and with a cooler head. 



We love you all: our chilango friends, the ""pochos,"" the ""expats/immigrants/digital nomads,"" and even the Monterrey natives who come in to spam when they have no business being here 😆. Grab a cup of coffee, relax, and smile. It's no good being visceral when making our points in an online discussion.

To which I replied "" yeah"" , he then asked, do you wanna go get a coffee, again yeah . But later he said he's getting a little late so I should just go to some cafe or bar and order drinks , it's on me , being someone who's super new to the city i said no , i can't on my own , so he said I'll pick you up , share me location, i didn't share him location through map but I told him my pg's name , which was stupid , as he went to some other pg with same name and it was around 8 kms from my location, i was already feeling awkward and wanted to say we shouldn't meet , and to add in that mess I didn't pick up his call as I put phone on silent ( i was at fault) he replied, ""thanks I was already having a bad day but maybe I needed this"" I never felt so bad so I apologized, saying hey please I'm sorry but you can always get better matches, to which he replied, we can still meet , i wanted to make up for my stupid silly mistakes and I wanted to apologise in person so I said yes, he arrived, my friends saw him ,  he was smoking, which isn't abnormal or new to me but to my friends it was , i called him , said please stop somewhere else ( I'm not a bad person y'all) and later we talked, he looked gorgeous and this is the main part where I need your help people,i was supposed to meet have coffee and get back to pg but then he decided to get beer , I said nothing, we went to his place and thought I'll still go to my pg by 11, we stepped into his flat , typical bachelors messy room, ciggerates , clothes piled up on bed , many things scattered on here and there , i started questioning myself if it was a good idea to come over to his place , but then we started talking, about life in general, he handed me a beer , I'm not good with drinks , so it's embarassing to admit but I started feeling a little ecstatic, i started opening up , and complimenting him ( like a simp) , and out of nowhere I started sobbing cause his reminded me of my ex 🤡 , so then he calmed me down , gave a forehead kiss.

The part where it all started feeling surreal - he said you're beautiful, you have model like features ( क्षमा करना, खुदकी तारीफ नहीं कर रही मैं 🤡) and I don't remember what exactly he said after and he went in for a kiss, and he said he wants to date me now - DO YOU GUY'S THINK IT'S A RED FLAG THAT A GUY WANTS TO DATE YOU WHO WAS SUPPOSEDLY MEETING JUST TO MAKEOUT) and don't judge me please 🤡 I gave up on serious dating so thought why not just try .

Any ideas? I have too many and can't nail them down! Haha. (Also don't wanna bother with the GroupOn options lol)

b. An ice cream or coffee shop to all meet at once we are finished.

It felt like everything that could possibly go wrong, did go wrong.

Now things are very slowly but nonetheless getting better, I’m starting to see the emptiness around me. I’m completely alone. This loneliness cuts deeper than anything else. I find myself craving simple human connection, someone to sit with me, look into my eyes, talk, just give me a tap on the shoulder or touch my hand, like the way I once used to crave coffee.

I know people you will say this sounds like depression, and that I need therapy. And I agree. I will go when I’m physically able.

Maybe I'm just stuck in my own head most of the time. I barely use my phone anymore, scared it’ll die on me. I took my old computer from 2nd grade out, tried to bring it back to life, installed Linux multiple times—but I think the hdd has given up. The system crashes after two or three uses.

Loved to read. Now I can’t even finish a few chapters even of the books i would read when I couldn't find anything else. I tried to force myself, but it just doesn’t work. Music was once my oxygen. Now, I can’t even bring myself to listen to my favorite songs.

I would call my ""friends"" and all they will ask is how is my health and things will stop there as i don't have nothing going on much so after a point it felt like i m disturbing them more from these calls.

And on top of all this I have to worry about finances. 

I honestly don’t know what else to do. I've tried everything within my reach and even pushed myself beyond what I thought I could handle just so I’d never say to myself, “I didn’t try hard enough.”


But by the time I get better physically, I fear I won’t be okay mentally anymore.",1,1751906966.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False

I've been looking for a good coffee replacement for a while since I cannot handle much caffeine.

Found this product at a local health food store and I love it:
https://teeccino.com/products/dandelion-dark-roast-herbal-tea?variant=39688645869737

Looks like they have lots of other teas/coffee replacements as well.

I just placed an order online for some more.

They gave me the following code for friends and family to save $10 off their first purchase. (Full disclosure: i would also receive $10 discount on a future purchase)

Just thought i would pass it along since I like this stuff so much and had never seen it until now.

Cheers

1ltz9mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/butchlesbians/comments/1ltz9mx/dating_apps_sigh_vent/,dating apps. *sigh* (vent),"I've spent a few years really focused on dating myself- loving me, creating a life full of joy. I'm ready to date!

After a year of trying to meet folks in the wild (and making friends because of it!), I finally gave in and downloaded hinge.  Most of the queer events in my area are EDM dance parties. I don't drink or do drugs, and I don't listen to electronic music, though I still go to them sometimes, because I do like dancing.  I'm also almost 40 and it seems like it's more young folks out late.  I talk to strangers everywhere I go and make friends.

I downloaded hinge two or three weeks ago, since that seemed to be the best for what I was looking for. Here is my rant:

First gripe-  quite a few women don't have their orientation listed! Am I supposed to assume you're straight or assume you're open to dating any gender?

second gripe- there's only about 30 women in my area who are either lesbian, bi, or pan. about half of these are an hour north of me and I work 45 minutes south of me, so that would be tough, so there's a pool of 20 women available including the ones with no orientation listed.  you think some of them would respond, right?

3rd gripe: no one responding. I've sent out quite a few likes with a question relevant to info they provided in their bio and a little about me- what's your fave scifi book you've read this year? mine's light from uncommon stars. what's the best alpine lake you've hiked to this summer? mine was etc... not one person has replied, so I assume they're not interested, fine. But hinge keeps showing me the same folks and I can't remember who I've already sent likes to and I don't want to keep liking the same person who's rejecting me. that's weird. 

4th gripe- I feel like these apps are made for young people with no complexity in their life.  The prompts and character limits are so basic, and then people put weird shit in there like ""you must like cheesy puffs or don't message me."" I feel like it's supposed to be a joke, but I don't like junk food, but it's fine if you eat some, and otherwise she seems cool... so weird. I'm surprised people aren't willing to just meet for a coffee date/interview, since the info is so basic.  

5th gripe- ""you must be authentic and good at communicating"" also seems so general. By the time we're in our 30-40's everyone who's dating thinks they're good at that, and it's something you don't really figure out until you meet if they're actually good at it. Maybe it's not implied, but to me, it's right up there with good hygiene- I expect it from everyone in my life. 

I downloaded Taimi as well, but it was awful- seemed like a bunch of bots with blurred faces trying to convince me to give money so I could see their photos. I deleted within 12 hours.

I'm trying not to spiral out and wonder if it's because I'm non-binary, but I also know it could be something arbitrary that makes people reject me.  I've spent a ton of time on my bio and photo choices, trying to show complexity and authenticity, goofiness and seriousness... it's rough out there folks!",10,1751906933.0,butchlesbians,12,1.0,False

1ltz7u4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltz7u4,"Hilton Zemi Miches, Dominican Republic","we stayed at the resort a few days after they opened for 4 nights. we were in a plunge pool room in casa 6 (more on that later). i enjoyed the pool and the beach, but would not recommend staying here for at least a year (longer would be better) while they iron out the service and finish significant construction. 

**the good**
- the interior design/furniture etc of the lobby and restaurants are very aesthetic and feel luxurious 
- AC is very strong 
- the pool didn’t feel too crowded, though lounge chairs were obviously at a premium later in the day 
- the beach and the mountains across the way are gorgeous 
- did not notice construction noises or sounds
- the way the plunge pools are set up lends itself to a bit of privacy so you don’t feel like you’re swimming with your neighbors 
- the activities staff working the pool and beach areas were upbeat and fun to chat with

**THE APP**
- the staff relies heavily on “the app” (in practice, it’s a website) to communicate what is available/hours. but, the app is often wrong. 
- ex 1: a pre-arrival email said that pickleball courts would be ready, and the app also said pickleball courts were open. we asked 3 different staff members about them. the first two told us they didn’t know and to check the app. the third confirmed the pickleball courts were, in fact, not open. 
- ex 2: on day 2, we made dinner reservations for our remaining nights. the app said Yuca (beach grill) would be open for dinner and let us make a reservation. turns out it wasn’t open for dinner that evening. 
- ex 3: on our last day we planned to get lunch at serra before check out. the app said they opened at 11. we showed up, empty. walked to the food hall, and they no longer serving. finally, we checked the food truck and it was also closed. the front desk informed us that serra didn’t open til 4, despite what the app said. they suggested the food truck and did not believe us when we said it was closed. they called to check and found out we were correct. their solution was to order food for us to the coffee shop, which was probably the best outcome we could’ve gotten though they still managed to get our order wrong. 

**FOOD**
- since it’s soft opening, they are rotating through different restaurants for dinner. it’s typically 2 plus the buffet for dinner. the issue is that the restaurants are very slow. for example: our first night we had a reservation at 8:40. we were seated promptly but did not receive our appetizers until 10pm (after asking 2x). we ended up leaving without our entrees. i’ll also note that there was pretty much no service between taking our order and us flagging them down to ask about our food (at 9:45). 
- i’d recommend snagging a 6pm reservation whenever possible and eating a hearty lunch 
- around 1 of every 3 items we wanted to order off a menu at the restaurants and bars were unavailable or had to be substantially modified from the menu description
- weirdly enough, we thought the sports bar had the best food
- we did room service for dinner one night and it was surprisingly fast. scheduled “asap” at 6:30, estimated time was 7, received food at 7:30pm. however, we ordered a “boneless bbq flatbread” and received boneless bbq chicken pieces (pictured) 
- i have the menus if anyone is curious but since this is already a novel i didn’t want to overwhelm 

**DRINKS**
- lobby bar had a cocktail menu and the cocktails were very solid 
- the pool bars had a cocktail menu (on the app), but bartenders were unfamiliar with menu cocktails 
- on average, typical poolside cocktails were perfectly fine 
- on day 3, they ran out of club soda across the resort 
- pool side drink service was spotty until day 4, when the resort seemed to get busier and they had more than 1 server working 

**OTHER**
- casa 5 was unoccupied and still  under construction, which made casa 6 kind of feel like it was at the far edge of the resort. once the slides and sport courts are finished this won’t be an issue
- there’s no direct, paved walking path to get from casa 6 to the main area/pool so if you have a choice, casa 3 seems more convenient 
- during check in, we were given a room tour and i asked where we could get ice and the answer was down the hall. we could not find the ice machine

Here's a short guide for you,"Hi, it's me, a random redditor from Brazil that attended Interlagos last year, will attend this year and decided to help anyone outside my country who come to see this weekend race. So sit here and come with me to understand how to watch the race without too much complication.

First things first. **What you can have at the racetrack**

Brazilian race organization are not friends with fun. So here's what you can ou cannot have with you:

* a camera (last year I saw someone with a professional one, BTW, this is not like F1);
* foods with the original package, fruits (if is cut and on a zip lock) and sandwich (on a ziplock), with a limit of 5 itens
* a bottle of water (500 ml max) or a cup of water (there's free water at various points of the track)

Also, if you are a ""gringo"" you will probably not have too much trouble paying for the expensive food at the track. In the fanzone, there will be some food trucks that you can check their profiles on the @/fiawec\_saopaulo Instagram profile (can't put the directly link here). I would try the juices, the choripã sandwich, a Bacio di Latte sorbet and anything from Casa do Porco.

Anyway, eat as much food as you can at your breakfast. This will allow you to avoid the lines at the food places inside the track for a few hours. If its available on your hotel, try the pão de queijo (cheese bread). I don't love the ones made from SP, but that's just because I'm from the place where they made them originally. It still good enough.

Next: **What you need to have with you at the racetrack**

It's a Brazilian race, but not in the raining season. So you probably not gonna have all the tropical country experience. Try to have with you:

* a raincape (buy a simple one ASAP, because over the weekend you will have to pay a lot more, if possible away from the track). It gets you warm and dry and a raincape can get your body a little warm too, so it's a win win. Its could season, but right now there's 40% of chance of a rain in the morning;
* a power-bank (you don't wanna see your baterry runs dry)
* a sunscreen protector (use a personal one so you can pass by the gates without problems);
* a sun-glass (you will need one, trust me);
* a cap (you will need one, trust me);
* a shirt for a windy day (temperature will go as low as 14ºC, but at the racetrack looks a lot cooler due to the wind).

And after: **What you can't have at the racetrack**

* a drone;
* alcohol beverages;
* drugs;
* anything that explodes (yeah, you can't bring your Mecachrone engine with you);
* guns and stuff that cuts;
* musical instruments;
* umbrella;
* aerossol sprays;
* helmets;
* chairs;
* coolers or thermos bottle;
* pets;
* flags with a stick;
* political propaganda;
* lasers.

And now: **How to get there**

São Paulo have something that a lot of brazillians don't have: a huge and usually clean metro system. So get a maps app, find the nearest train station and remember the best way to get to the linha Amarela (Yellow line) so you can jump to the linha Esmeralda (Emerald line) at the Pinheiros station and just leave the train when you arrive at the Autódromo station (Racetrack station, for those who don't understand Portuguese). If you arrive at Osasco station, you got the wrong way. Buy your tickets for the weekend at your first trip to the track so you can avoid the lines on your way back. You can pay with a card.

You can always get a Uber, a taxi or a bus (178 (Interlagos/ Jd. Maria Rosa) or 675 (Jd. São Luiz/Interlagos) are the best ones). But the train it's the most used way and also the most convenient.

Remember to check you way from the metro to the track. It's not hard, but you can get in trouble if you get the wrong street. In case of any doubts, just look around, find someone with racing merch and follow them. Worked for me everytime I've gone to Interlagos but, in the last years, I just get an Uber from the train station and the track. We can share one if you recognize me!

Also, at the saturday and sunday, try to arrive as early as possible because the track and the lines will be kind of huge next to the time of the race. Use the jet-lag at your favor.

PS: the track don't offer a parking spot for those without a Terrace by Le Mans Spirit Club ticket, but you can use some of the private ones that are really close to the track.

And last before the last: **Tips of things to do at the racetrack**

The A stand it's the best. Trust me. Last year, if you had any ticket for the highest paid sectors, like the VIP ones, you could run around without problem. So use this in your favor.

There will be some rock shows during the events. You can check them at the official social media profile of the race. The bands are good Brazilian rock bands that survived the test of time.

Last year, at the Toyota marketing activation spot, they were serving free coffee. So *watch this space* for this year.

The official timetable is on the official social media profile of the race. The GT Series is a really small GT3/GT4 regional championship. For me, It's what we call here in Brazil ""sausage cup"", but it's better than nothing.

Use friday to find the best spot at your grandstand. At the sector A, you can see the start line, the end of reta oposta ([that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhrAgoHCoyo)) and some parts of the sector 3. At the fanzone, you can see the ""miolo"" of the racetrack, or for a lack of a better word, the ""inside part"". So lurk around to have some place to be at the weekend when the race starts.

If you have some time to visit São Paulo and the city, It's aways worth to try some coffee shops, a good pão de queijo (again, will not be really good because it's a pão de queijo made in São Paulo, but will be good), some Minas Gerais cheese (I like Serro more than Canastra, but you should have both) and some brazillian churrasco. For me, I will see/would recommend:

\- the Beluga pizza near the racetrack;

\- a full meat at Koya88, ICI Bistrô, A Baianeira, Cozinha dos Ferrari, Amazo, Merenda Cidade or La Peruana;

\- a fast meal at Z Deli, Hot Pork, Pato Rei or Sujinho;

\- a breakfast at Por Um Punhado de Dólares, Zud, Fabrique (go early), KEZ or KOF;

\- and last: if you're a LGBT+ person, there's a especial party happening at Dentro Bar this week, with drag shows and hot beverages that are usually only served at this time of the year.

I hope you enjoy the city, avoid the tourist traps and have a great race.",6,1751906717.0,formula1,3,0.62,False

I used to buy sooooo much stuff from ASOS etc to then basically never wear it. I have realised how wasteful that is and how I was just constantly craving that dopamine rush. Years of buying way too much means I now have more than enough clothes, so I make sure I wear everything I have and I even have a digital inventory of every item so that I can mark how often I wear something and if it doesn't get enough wear, it gets donated. I've stopped buying things because I cannot justify that to myself anymore. My point is that I think Carrie's wardrobe is bigger than mine, yet I constantly see her in the same handful of items (don't get me started on those damn red shorts). There's so much that she just never wears. I'm not shaming her for overconsumption because I did the same thing, but then don't act like you're all about sustainability? At least be aware that you still have a lot of work to do? She thinks because she mostly thrifts that that makes it sustainable, but while it's better than buying new things from ASOS or Shein, it's still the same cycle of buying and getting rid of stuff you've barely worn. She is still regularly adding clothes to an already overflowing wardrobe.

I understand that she needs to make content, but why does it all have to be about buying things? It seems like lately every video is a variety of one of three categories: thrifting, trends, or changing rooms. And then a dehaul of what she bought in the previous videos. There's so much more she could be doing? Videos about trying to be sustainable, different types of workouts, testing things like biker shorts etc for a full day instead of one minute, places and things to do in Arizona, showing activities, some book content, maintaining her garden, literally ANYTHING. Or go somewhere for a few days that isn't Disneyland? She says we only see 10% of her life so maybe that's what she does the other 90%, but at this point for the love of God...show us that then haha. 

Also the obsession with LA... I moved to London myself so I can't judge her for wanting to live in her favourite city, but you have to compromise. I live in a small flat, I sold my soul to a corporate job so I can afford life here, and I have a lot less money to spend on things like the aforementioned clothing hauls. She expects to live in one of the most expensive places in the country, have a big place (maybe this is me being European but the flats and houses she looks at are massive, especially for two people), spend work her days food shopping and returning parcels, and still be able to spend hundreds of dollars on the latest hairdryer or social media trend. You simply cannot have it all. I'm not denying that the housing market is insane, but unfortunately that's the way it is so if you want to live in your dream location you have to make changes to your lifestyle. Of course there are content creators that live in LA but they probably don't abandon plans to shoot an all-day video after two hours because they're 'feeling tired' and they probably try very hard to have some variety in their content and keep their audience interested.

I cackled when she had this big epiphany that maybe she should just try to enjoy life in AZ for a bit. Yeah, no shit. I get that's it's not her favourite city and that it's hot as hell, but she lives in a big house that most people would kill for. And I've never been there but it doesn't look like she lives in the middle of nowhere completely away from everything? It's still a big city with things to do? Personally I want to make the most out of life in London so I go to a different area every weekend, or book cheap tickets to something, or go to a museum, or visit different bookshops and cafes. That's all stuff she could post about. Since she clearly does have some money to live life, I don't understand why she doesn't do more activities or days out instead of spending it on the latest TikTok hype? Again, maybe Phoenix doesn't have those things, but then again she didn't really do that in LA either, so why is she so desperate to go back there? Just to go to Erewhon and the flea market?

Lastly, I've had it with her definition of a work day haha. Getting up and going for a nice walk, taking the time to drink a smoothie or iced coffee, dropping off some parcels, redecorating a room in your home, doing some crafts and going for a big food shop? That's what most people would consider a very relaxed Sunday. I get that she probably does admin work etc that we don't see but it's the complete lack of self-awareness for me. At least be aware that you have a job that is a lot more chill than most people's. I've been following her for years (since the good old storytime days) but especially recently it has become undeniable that she has just stopped caring.",16,1751906631.0,CarrieDaytonYT,2,1.0,False

About ten years ago, I bought a Miffy plush toy in a suit for my then-girlfriend, now wife. This plush has travelled with us on all our journeys together — including our most recent trip to Hamburg. Unfortunately, during this trip, we lost it.

We suspect we lost it at the hotel (Leonardo Altona hotel in Hamburg at the Beerenweg, checkout date 22/6), but unfortunately, they have not been able to find it. I'm afraid we may not get it back. However, if you dont try you know for sure all is lost so therefore this post. I hope you can help me with this or know somwhere we can buy another one or someone to buy one from.

**Work hours: Monday-Friday, 9 am-4 pm**

One lane of traffic will always be open in both directions.

Phase 2 - Dallas North Trunk Sewer Improvements is a City of Plano Engineering Department project. It begins upstream at Prairie Creek, just east of Independence Parkway and routes west along Plano Parkway within the roadway median to connect just west of Coit Road with the North Texas Municipal Water District’s existing White Rock Creek Sewer Force Main. 

The $16.1 million project increases sewer capacity for current and future development needs in this area of Plano. The project installs:

* 6,980 linear feet of 36-inch and 42-inch fiberglass reinforced sanitary sewer pipe.
* 1,250 linear feet of slip-lined pipe. This process allows the existing pipe to be used with a new lining inside to extend its life expectancy.
* 1 aerial crossing across Prairie Creek, on the south side of Plano Parkway, just east of Independence Parkway.
* 4 hand tunnels, at locations crossing intersecting streets, to avoid above-ground crossings of these heavy traffic locations.

1ltz0fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1ltz0fc/sudden_tooth_sensitivity/,Sudden tooth sensitivity,"35f No drugs or smoking or medical conditions 

I had a snowball last night (for those who don't know what it is, it's basically like a slushie). My front top tooth started hurting from the cold. Kind of the teeth next to it too but mostly that one. It continued to hurt for a bit after. This morning it felt better. I had an iced coffee and now it hurts again. I do have sensitive teeth sometimes and use sensodyne. I had a dentist appt 2 weeks ish ago with xrays and all was well. Ive been having a lot of cold drinks lately due to a heat wave (smoothies, snowballs, ice water, ice coffee) everyday. Could this be causing sensitivity or I need to go back to the dentist? My insurance only pays for an appt every 6mos so it would be out of pocket. Ive never had a cavity before so I dont know how that feels. Should I stop with cold stuff?

Note. ive been having issues with sinus pressure/congestion due to allergies, not sure if that matters. Thanks",1,1751906357.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Like going to bed 30 minutes earlier. Drinking water before coffee. Leaving your phone in another room. Starting a tiny habit.

For me, it was writing down one small win each night — no matter how crappy the day felt. “Didn’t hit snooze” or “Didn’t rage-quit that annoying Zoom call.” After a few weeks, it somehow rewired how I looked at my progress. Less guilt. More momentum.

Curious if anyone else here has had a similar experience — a small change that felt unimportant but turned out to be a game-changer.",6,1751906300.0,CasualConversation,14,1.0,False

for day 1 food-wise, i kept things pretty soft and bland. scrambled egg whites with dry toast, egg noodles and chicken, and jello were my go-tos. i started branching out at day 2 and had coffee with my breakfast with no issues. while i didn't have any problems with food, my biggest concern was my bloating and constipation. my last bowel movement was on july 2nd, and even though i'd been drinking prune juice, taking colace and ducolax, i still hadn't passed anything by day 3. TMI for this next part lol - i eventually became desperate and used a saline enema to help me go 😭 it worked, but it left me in the worst pain i've felt since having the surgery. i wasn't able to keep any food in for the rest of the day, as i had diarrhea after eating anything as small as saltines. however, the bowel movement was definitely needed because i feel soo much better today! my bloating is pretty much gone, the pain is a lot better and i was able to tolerate a banana with oatmeal and coffee for breakfast without having to run to the bathroom afterwards.

the last few days have been absolutely miserable but i can finally see now that things are looking up for me. i'm just taking it one day at a time :]",3,1751906299.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

Todd is creating minimalist furniture using modern industrial tools, which naturally favor straight lines and right angles, to re-infuse the curves that existed before the wood was milled as lumber. Working with walnut, oak, maple, and southern yellow pine, he builds pieces that attract the hand as well as the eye.

* Something Wild is Brewing features the bold and imaginative work of Christopher Freeman, whose art radiates energy, color, and layered visual storytelling. His paintings combine surreal landscapes, abstract forms, and pop-culture fragments to create scenes that are both disorienting and oddly familiar. Freeman’s work invites viewers to look closer, cultivating reverence for the animals he depicts and reminding us that the wild places they inhabit are fragile and worth protecting.

I thought I could elevate the game by bringing my electric kettle. I suspected as much, but it demanded too much draw for the outlet… So, I got the hot water from the stewardess.

I finished off my AMOC Pink Bourban (Wilton Benitez), which was a treat to wake up to. D27 is my new favorite for a travel brewer. The thing can’t make a bad cup, and it’s light as a feather. I will also recommend this tiny kettle for your travel setup (in comments). I think it’s only good for pouring, but the spout is so precise! It’s perfect for the D27. It felt scaled at the same ratio as a v60 to a typical kettle. 

I really wished the electric kettle worked… I still made a spectacular cup. Either way, I’m never drinking airplane coffee again!

That's always what I've thought). All of my siblings and I got treated differently by my mother, my older sisters got yelled at all lot and made to do extra work and two know their dad so she'd kick them out to their dad's. By the time my younger siblings were born they got taken away by our grandparents in another state so I don't know them. I'm in the middle and I was her favorite because I was a ""handsome"" kid and thinking back now a lot of adults are very creepy about these kinds of things including my mother. She had me do print modeling until I could move out I don't even think it made much money bit either way I never got any money. 

I won't lie I went along with it because I was scared, I didn't want to get treated like my sisters if I acted out. It was easier to be the favorite she'd show me bits of what would happen if I got on her bad side like pulling my hair or accusing me of wanting her to die. And so when she would make them do things like clean the entire house or lock them out I never helped. As a result my sister were pretty mean to me growing up but Sarah was the worst, one time she and her boyfriend made me take off all my clothes and they sprayed me with the hot shower (our water boiler got excessively hot) it was humiliating. I never told because I didn't want her to really end up homeless or something if our mom found out. I don't hate her but I don't love her either and I can't really see us ever talking with each other, I don't really want to. But recently she reached out to me on social media and wrote a long apology and asked if we could go get lunch or coffee and I said no but I that I accept her apology. After that basically she told me that If I really forgave her then we could make amends and that I never even apologized to her for siding with our mother growing up.

That’s it. I had a long day at work, my back hurt, and I really just wanted something hot in my hands before going home. I lined up. Waited like everyone else. Nothing dramatic. Then this woman, mid thirties maybe, cuts right in front of me. I was stunned. I said, “Excuse me, I was in line.” She turns to me loud, dramatic and goes, “Girl, please. I look better than you anyway. Like… what? Who says that? I literally blinked. Thought maybe I misheard. So I said calmly, I swear “There’s no reason to embarrass me just because you’re having a bad day.” She rolled her eyes and laughed, “Embarrass you? Honey, you did that by walking out the house looking like that.” Everyone heard. People were staring. My hands started shaking. I didn’t even know what to do with my face. You ever get so embarrassed, you can feel it behind your eyes? That heat? Yeah, that. The barista didn’t step in. Nobody said anything. 

My husband, who was waiting at a table, stood up when he heard the noise but he didn’t get involved. He just gave me a look like, “Please don’t start.” So I told her again, louder this time, “Don’t try to humiliate me in front of people. Just get in line like everyone else.” She laughed, said I was “too sensitive” and called me basic. I ended up walking out. No coffee. No nothing. Just shame clinging to my skin the whole way home. I didn’t want to cry in public but I definitely broke down in the car. Later, my husband said I could’ve just ignored her. That maybe I did too much. But how do you just let someone say that to you? In front of people? Without standing up for yourself? I’ve been spiraling about it for days. I didn’t throw insults. I didn’t scream. I just asked not to be humiliated.

1ltyvgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1ltyvgb/45_month_learning_plan_for_two_languages/,4.5 month learning plan for two languages,"*Sorry for the long post, this is both an braindump/accountability thing for me, as well as a request for people more experienced in language learning to give me some pointers*

I have recently moved to Spain to be with my partner and really would like to improve my language skills. I am around a B1 in Spanish and an almost nonexistent level of Catalan. (Un)Fortunately, I cannot legally work right now nor do I have any way of knowing when I will get work authorization, which means I am in an unusual position of having near unlimited time to study these two languages. However, I am someone who really needs structure in order to meet my goals. As such, I am planning on signing up for a DELE B2 exam that will take place on 22/11, giving me 4.5 months. By that point, I hope to be B2 in Spanish (enough to work) and A2 in Catalan (enough to start to get around). While I had originally planned on focusing purely on Spanish and then switching to Catalan in the future, I live in a small town where pretty much everything is in Catalan and not speaking Catalan is hampering my ability to socialize/engage with anything going on here.



**Here is my plan. Would love to get some eyes on it to see if it seems feasible/helpful, as I have never made a lesson plan like this for myself**



**Spanish**

Current level: B1 (did AP Spanish in high school over a decade ago, placed into a B1 class in Spain last year but could only do it for a couple of months, was able to struggle through an internship which included me giving weekly reports in Spanish)

Desired level: B2

Hours spent per week: 20 hours active, 30 hours passive



**Active studying breakdown:**

**7 hours a week on coursebook (1 hour a day)**

Main coursebook: Aula Plus 3-6 (might start at 4 depending on how 3 feels)

Supplemental: Uso de la Gramática Española: Intermedio 

For DELE specifically: Las Claves del Nuevo DELE B2 (I will start this a month prior to the exam)



**2 hours a week on writing (30 mins a day, 4 days a week).** 

This will either be free writing exercises from prompts or doing Es->Eng >Es translations (as I saw someone in this Reddit post about)



**4 hours a week doing language exchange (2 hours a day, 2 days a week).**

I found a meetup in my town that does language exchange. I have yet to go, so I am not sure if it is mostly Spanish or Catalan, but I will go and try my best. Regardless of what language the in-person language exchange focuses on, I will also be doing online language exchange on Tandem. 



**7 hours a week practicing with partner (1 hour a day)**

Set aside an hour a day where we speak to each other only in Spanish (we normally speak in English). It likely won’t be an intensive thing, just sectioning off an hour of the day where the only language we can speak is Spanish.



**Passive studying breakdown:**

**10 hours a week reading (2 hour a day, 5 days a week)**

I plan to read a mix of learner material (my library has a number of B1-B2 graded books), YA fantasy (a friend recommended Sueños de Piedra, which I will give a shot), and manga (mostly slice of life, like Yotsuba, Sombras sobre Shimanami, Buenas Noches, Punpun, etc).



**5 hours a week listening to podcasts (30 mins-1 hour a day before bed)**

Still trying to find some podcasts that I vibe with, since the rapport between the hosts is generally what draws me in. I am not planning on listening to any podcasts geared towards language learners, but instead podcasts on topics that I am interested in (LGBT, culinary, TTRPG actual play). I know that these will be much harder, but with podcasts in particular, I need them to be aligned with my interests or I won’t stick with them.



**5 hours a week watching TV (1 hour a day, 5 days a week)**

Honestly, not a huge TV person in any language, but there have been a couple of shows that I have enjoyed (Los Misterios de Laura, Drag Race España) and there are some shows I am interested in trying (Smiley, Física o Química, Los Espookys).



**10 hours a week playing video games (2 hour a day, 5 days a week)**

A lot of the games that I play are pretty text heavy (RPGs, visual novels), so I will try to play them in Spanish. My list currently includes Dragon Quest XI, Sea of Stars, Inazuma 11, Coffee Talk, Fire Emblem (the newer ones with more dialogue), some of the Mario RPGs, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, but I will add more as I think of them.

 

**Catalan**

Current level: A0 (I have a surprisingly extensive culinary vocabulary due to a previous internship and can intuit what simple Catalan sentences mean but can only make the simplest of sentences like “No parlo català” ”On és el bany” etc) 

Desired level: A2? (enough to be comfortable using Catalan when going about town and basically understand what people are talking about when at events)

Hours spent per week: scale up to 10 hours a week



**Breakdown:**

It’s been a while since I started a completely new language, so I want to pace myself a bit so as to not overwhelm myself. I will get a coursebook from the library to work on maybe 3-4 times a week and also do daily Anki flashcards in order to grow my vocabulary (as well as practice pronunciation with my partner). We found some free children’s books the other day (Els Tres Porquets, La Sireneta, etc) that I will work my way up to. I also signed up for a Catalan class at a local school, which is 4 hours a week, but that will start at the end of September. 



Hopefully this set up will help keep the two languages separate enough as to not cross wires. My proposed 60 hours a week seems a bit daunting, but it is a lot of passive learning so I hope it will be fine. Really, I just want to find ways to occupy my time, and I have a high tolerance for self study as I have (unfortunately) done two Masters. ",3,1751906047.0,languagelearning,0,1.0,False
1ltyvcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1ltyvcc/trusting_a_spiritual_father_you_cant_trust/,Trusting a spiritual father you can't trust,"I've been a catechumen for about 1.5 years now, coming from Catholicism. I live in a non-Orthodox country, where there is only one parish available to me: it's either this one or nothing. Having struggled a lot, I've realized the only thing that's still keeping from becoming Orthodox is the priest.  
Catechesis, homilies and coffee breaks have been an advanced course on conspiracy theories. The priest is knowledgeable when it comes to doctrine; unfortunately, he's also unable to distinguish Orthodox doctrine from his own very personal and often questionable opinions.  
Over the course of my catechumenate, I've heard being brought to the altar (or to the coffee table after liturgy) any sort of wild things. If you are familiar with someone who fell for conspiracy theories, you'll know what this is about, and will also know it's impossible to have any real discussion with them.  
The world is led by Freemasons and Sionists. The Jews inflated the numbers of the Holocaust, so they could have their own State; they also do like those shepherds who set their own woods on fire, meaning they undergo tragedies willingly and on purpose, so they can start re-growing stronger than before and multiply. When we confined them into ghettos, we did them a favor, because they learned how to handle money and made a fortune out of it. Muslims are taking over our countries and should be sent back. We live under dictatorships, and the only difference between us and those who lived under Nazism or Communism is that we don't think we're living under a regime; and the reason is that we too, like them, are identified with a number when we open a bank account. Covid was a made-up emergency meant to help establish a regime. Russian soldiers aren't really killing anyone in Ukraine (yes, I heard this too). There isn't even one single homily without a rant against Europe. Etc. Etc. You know the rest. Add to this some Southern-Baptist-like vibes, where during the the liturgy we're informed that this or that kind of sinners are ""most certainly going to end up to eternal damnation"" (it's a Catholic country, so this all sounds very...exotic to say the least).  
Trying to avoid these topics is impossible, because they're an obsession for him, so he manages to include them into any conversation, be it about church history, liturgy or even trivial, casual things. You try to do some small talk and bring up the weather? He'll take that opportunity to say that climate change is an hoax that mainstream media want us to believe to promote their agenda. It's like he soaks up anything his Facebook feed will propose to him. It's an illness. And a passion, because he gets heated up if I try to challenge him.  
I knew all this after just one or two liturgies. I chose to become a catechumen anyway because... I couldn't not. I am too drawn by Orthodoxy. Luckily I had already studied it a lot on my own before starting to attend, because if I had to judge Orthodoxy based on what I heard at my parish, by now I'd think it's a cult for nuts.  
I put my best effort into it, and learned to genuinely appreciate him as a person, and even as a priest for he is very prepared and knowledgeable. He's not bad. He's not even far-right from what I can tell. He just must have been taught that to be truly Orthodox, one has to believe exactly the contrary of whatever is popular in the secular world, and has to be a culture warrior too.  
The problem is, even if I learned to appreciate him from a certain angle, and can get on with him as a person, it's time for me to admit it: I will never be able to trust him at all as a spiritual father. The damage already done is too big. I can't imagine how I could trust him with my spiritual life. I will never be able to really pour my hear into a confession, for fear of having to deal with some absurdities. When I am around him, I feel claustrophobic and almost can't breath well.  
I know that even saints could get things wrong. But the scale of it is just too large here. If someone is too obfuscated by ideology to see clearly the earthly things, I can I trust him on the heavenly ones?  
Finally, the question: how does one cope with this? I think I'll still become Orthodox in the end, as soon as I find the courage, because I really believe God is calling me, despite all this. But how do you practically deal with a spiritual father you can't trust? What do you do? It might take many years before he moves somewhere else.  
Note: writing to the bishop isn't an option, there are literally only 3 or 4 people attending in total (surprise uh?), so he'd know it's me. And it could be years before they find a replacement, so I'd deprive my poor fellow parishioners of the liturgy, and they had been left alone for many years already.

1ltyufe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wec/comments/1ltyufe/going_for_the_6h_of_são_paulo_this_week_heres_a/,Going for the 6h of São Paulo this week? Here's a short guide for you,"Hi, it's me, a random redditor from Brazil that attended Interlagos last year, will attend this year and decided to help anyone outside my country who come to see this weekend race. So sit here and come with me to understand how to watch the race without too much complication.

First things first. **What you can have at the racetrack**

Brazilian race organization are not friends with fun. So here's what you can ou cannot have with you:

* a camera (last year I saw someone with a professional one, BTW, this is not like F1);
* foods with the original package, fruits (if is cut and on a zip lock) and sandwich (on a ziplock), with a limit of 5 itens 
* a bottle of water (500 ml max) or a cup of water (there's free water at various points of the track)

Also, if you are a ""gringo"" you will probably not have too much trouble paying for the expensive food at the track. In the fanzone, there will be some food trucks that you can check their profiles [here](https://www.instagram.com/fiawec_saopaulo/p/DLNZz6fuNav/). I would try the juices, the choripã sandwich, a Bacio di Latte sorbet and anything from Casa do Porco.

Anyway, eat as much food as you can at your breakfast. This will allow you to avoid the lines at the food places inside the track for a few hours. If its available on your hotel, try the pão de queijo (cheese bread). I don't love the ones made from SP, but that's just because I'm from the place where they made them originally. It still good enough.

Next: **What you need to have with you at the racetrack**

It's a Brazilian race, but not in the raining season. So you probably not gonna have all the tropical country experience. Try to have with you:

* a raincape (buy a simple one ASAP, because over the weekend you will have to pay a lot more, if possible away from the track). It gets you warm and dry and a raincape can get your body a little warm too, so it's a win win. Its could season, but right now there's 40% of chance of a rain in the morning;
* a power-bank (you don't wanna see your baterry runs dry)
* a sunscreen protector (use a personal one so you can pass by the gates without problems);
* a sun-glass (you will need one, trust me);
* a cap (you will need one, trust me);
* a shirt for a windy day (temperature will go as low as 14ºC, but at the racetrack looks a lot cooler due to the wind).

And after: **What you can't have at the racetrack**

* a drone;
* alcohol beverages;
* drugs;
* anything that explodes (yeah, you can't bring your Mecachrone engine with you);
* guns and stuff that cuts;
* musical instruments;
* umbrella;
* aerossol sprays;
* helmets;
* chairs;
* coolers or thermos bottle;
* pets;
* flags with a stick;
* political propaganda;
* lasers.

And now: **How to get there**

São Paulo have something that a lot of brazillians don't have: a huge and usually clean metro system. So get a maps app, find the nearest train station and remember the best way to get to the linha Amarela (Yellow line) so you can jump to the linha Esmeralda (Emerald line) at the Pinheiros station and just leave the train when you arrive at the Autódromo station (Racetrack station, for those who don't understand Portuguese). If you arrive at Osasco station, you got the wrong way. Buy your tickets for the weekend at your first trip to the track so you can avoid the lines on your way back. You can pay with a card.

You can always get a Uber, a taxi or a bus (178 (Interlagos/ Jd. Maria Rosa) or 675 (Jd. São Luiz/Interlagos) are the best ones). But the train it's the most used way and also the most convenient.

Remember to check you way from the metro to the track. It's not hard, but you can get in trouble if you get the wrong street. In case of any doubts, just look around, find someone with racing merch and follow them. Worked for me everytime I've gone to Interlagos but, in the last years, I just get an Uber from the train station and the track. We can share one if you recognize me!

Also, at the saturday and sunday, try to arrive as early as possible because the track and the lines will be kind of huge next to the time of the race. Use the jet-lag at your favor.

PS: the track don't offer a parking spot for those without a Terrace by Le Mans Spirit Club ticket, but you can use some of the private ones that are really close to the track.

And last before the last: **Tips of things to do at the racetrack**

The A stand it's the best. Trust me. Last year, if you had any ticket for the highest paid sectors, like the VIP ones, you could run around without problem. So use this in your favor.

There will be some rock shows during the events. You can check them [here](https://www.instagram.com/fiawec_saopaulo/p/DKxtgRmPpbG/?img_index=1). The bands are good Brazilian rock bands that survived the test of time.

Last year, at the Toyota marketing activation spot, they were serving free coffee. So *watch this space* for this year.

[This](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLLAZkoPCsb/) is the official timetable. The GT Series is a really small GT3/GT4 regional championship. For me, It's what we call here in Brazil ""sausage cup"", but it's better than nothing.  

Use friday to find the best spot at your grandstand. At the sector A, you can see the start line, the end of reta oposta ([that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhrAgoHCoyo)) and some parts of the sector 3. At the fanzone, you can see the ""miolo"" of the racetrack, or for a lack of a better word, the ""inside part"". So lurk around to have some place to be at the weekend when the race starts.

If you have some time to visit São Paulo and the city, It's aways worth to try some coffee shops, a good pão de queijo (again, will not be really good because it's a pão de queijo made in São Paulo, but will be good), some Minas Gerais cheese (I like Serro more than Canastra, but you should have both) and some brazillian churrasco. For me, I will see/would recommend:

\- the Beluga pizza near the racetrack;

\- anything for a meal thats listed [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tgrJwt9AQMmdmkS29), but with a major heads up for Koya88, ICI Bistrô, A Baianeira, Cozinha dos Ferrari, Amazo, Merenda Cidade and La Peruana;

\- anything for a fast meal that's listed [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QGgei9TyzTuf3eqNA), but with a major heads up for Z Deli, Hot Pork, Pato Rei and Sujinho;

\- anything for a breakfast that's listed [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8TvVejo3r42NiVsC6), but with a nice heads up for Por Um Punhado de Dólares, Zud, Fabrique (go early), KEZ and KOF;

\- anything for a drink that's listed [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PixavMGPjYSQDo2A7).

And last: if you're a LGBT+ person, there's a especial party happening at Dentro Bar this week, with drag shows and hot beverages that are usually only served at this time of the year. 

I hope you enjoy the city, avoid the tourist traps and have a great race.",21,1751905977.0,wec,1,0.96,False

1ltyrci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1ltyrci/summer_2025_auto_train_experience_and_tips/,Summer 2025 Auto Train Experience and Tips,"We recently returned from a trip on the auto train and wanted to share a few things about our experience.  I'll start with our planning, why we chose autotrain, and continue through our departure and return trip.

**Planning**

As a family of four traveling from Maryland to the Orlando area, I felt like I had three choices.  Drive, Fly, or AutoTrain.  Driving seemed miserable for our family because my kids are elementary school and don't sleep well in cars, my spouse doesn't sleep well in the car, and I have back issues.  The thought of driving 16 hours straight through wasn't appealing at all.  Breaking the trip into two eight-hour chunks was equally unappealing since we'd be eating a lot of meals out of paper bags and having to pay for a hotel.  

Flights to MCO from BWI are really simple.  Southwest flies direct and I thought for sure that this would be the way to go.  I priced out four seats round trip with favorable departure times (e.g. no 6am flights, no red eyes, etc.).  I added in the cost of renting a minivan for the eight days that we were in the area.  Disclaimer that I have Avis preferred so my discount was applied.  I did not factor in meals at the airport nor parking at the airport.  I also did not factor in adding my wife as an authorized driver to the rental.  

Next I priced out several options on the auto train.  My options were two roomettes, two bedrooms, or a family room.  The two roomettes were cheaper than the other options but leaving a young kid alone in the compartment to shower or use the restroom was not appealing to me so we ruled that out.  The family room was enticing as it would let all of us be in a single room but with the downside of using a shared hallway bathroom.  The two individual bedrooms were a great option having the bathroom inside of our room but with the downside of not being all together.  Its worth noting that two bedrooms was comparable in price to one family room.  In fact, the two rooms was cheaper on the southbound leg and the family room cheaper on the northbound leg but within $100 either way.  

Thanks to this subreddit, I learned that if you call to make your reservation, you can request adjoining bedrooms.  With this option we had two bedrooms next to each other but the wall separating them was a pocket door that stayed open.  This gave us the best possible option.  We had four beds and two bathrooms all together.  **Tip for families:   Call to make your reservations.**

So let's talk about price of flying vs. the train. We were about $300 more expensive to take the train.  Once I added in the cost of parking at BWI and a meal at the airport on either end, we were getting darn close.  If I add in that southwest now has bag fees and I need to carry booster seats for young kids, we're getting closer.  BUT once we talk about the hassle of lugging around the booster seats, going through security, getting the rental car, getting everyone comfortable in the rental, we're starting to see some REAL value in the train.  So we did.    A little while later, my wife convinced me that we needed to do priority unload.  That was an extra $105 each way!

**Arrival at Lorton**

Our deadline for arriving at Lorton was 2:30pm for a 4pm departure.  Originally, my plan was to arrive at 2pm.  BUT as I read on the Internet, I found that if you arrive early you have more options for dinner seating.  I did not want to be stuck with a 9pm dinner with young kids.   So we altered our plan to arrive around noon.  Well DC traffic had its way with us and by the time we stopped for some drive through lunch, we arrived at Lorton at 12:30.  Here is how this went down...

We stopped at a fast food drive through not knowing when we'd get to eat next and not wanting to pack food from home.  When you pull into Lorton, you will check in at a gatehouse.  The representative there only needs your name.  I had my tickets ready but it wasn't needed.   They put a magnet on our family van and directed us to drive up under a large awning.  We pulled in, parked it, and were told to leave it running, put the key in the cupholder, put the driver window down, and grab our stuff.   They handed me a little paper folio with a number written on it.  This corresponded to the number on our van.  We had to grab bags out of the back of the van, get everyone's stuff, the lunch, and then get inside.  Once inside, we found seating right away where the kids and my SO sat to eat.  I got in line to check in.  The time now was just a bit after 12:30 and the representative at check in asked me if I wanted 7:00 or 9:00 for dinner. The 5pm dinner was already booked.  Rats.  I asked for 7pm and he turned around to get our boarding pass.   He came back and said that someone had set aside 5pm dinner tickets for us and asked if we wanted those instead.  Woo hoo!  I wasn't sure how that happened but we usually eat around 5:30pm so waiting until 7 would have meant snacks.  The representative at the checkin told me that we would start to board at 2:30 and motioned to the train platform out the opposite doors.   Hurry up and wait now...

Let's talk about Lorton Station.  The building is nice.  It wasn't crowded at the time and you can watch the cars get loaded on to the autoracks (vehicle carrying railcars).  We popped our head into the gift shop there and were thankful that we brought snacks.  Everything was about double the price you would expect at a gas station which is already more than a grocery store.  Want a bag of combos?  $10.  Lorton Station does have a playground which is a great idea but poorly executed.  The playground is very small and right next to the smoking area which is far from ideal unless you're a smoking parent.  We walked the platform but then just wound up sitting around in the station for a while.  The station started to get crowded around 1:30.  By 2pm, we walked out on the platform to wait by our car.  They let us board at 2:15 so we were ahead of schedule.  

**Lorton Tips**

1. Pack your car such that everything you need for the train is in backpacks or handheld bags and within easy reach.
2. Get lunch before you arrive.
3. If you have a preference for an early dinner, get to Lorton early.  
4. Bring snacks. 
5. Have those iPads charged!

**On Board and Departure**

We boarded our train and were greeted at the door by our room attendant.  They will need to collect your boarding pass that you got from checkin.  They will also look at your dining tickets.  DO NOT LOSE your dining tickets.  The attendant gave us directions up the stairs and to our rooms.  The stairs are steep, narrow, and turn.  Here is where smaller bags and lightweight stuff comes into play.  With a snack bag, my backpack, and one kid's backpack, it was tough for me (average size) to maneuver up the steps.  I'm thrilled we didn't have any roller bags or large items.  

We got to our room and were really pleased with the size of the space.  The divider was already open and we had plenty of space to stretch out.  There were room-temperature bottles of water in the room.  Ice was available in the hallway along with coffee and tea (no charge).  The rooms have a duplex outlet by the sink and a single outlet by the lower bunk.  I read that there was only one outlet and to bring a power strip but that wasn't needed for us but I'll recommend [this charger ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5QY4BL2)for laptops/ipads/watches/phones anyway.  The lower bunk is configured into a sofa which three of us could sit on comfortably.  There is also a chair opposite the sofa which I found horrendously uncomfortable but thankfully the sofa was great.  The upper bunk was folded up and out of the way.  The attendant came by to give us information and ask when we wanted our room converted for sleeping.  We departed Lorton at 3:30pm, 30 minutes ahead of schedule.  

Our evening consisted of looking out the windows, watching movies on ipads, and doing a bit of work on laptops.  Dinner exceeded our expectations which were admittedly low.  I mean its a train, how good could the food be?   The kids disliked the mac and cheese.  It was really rich and they like the junk from a box.  The steak was good and cooked to my desired temperature.  The kids got apple juice which was too sweet for them.  They are used to the Honest brand juice.  The service was excellent.  We returned to our room to find that the attendant did in fact convert it while we were at dinner as requested.  Once the beds were folded down, we had significantly less room to maneuver.  Between the sink and the lower bunk was less than a foot of space so you have to turn sideways.  Passengers of size might find this to be an issue.  

The top bunks have a cargo net for safety.  My kids don't toss and turn much so we weren't concerned.  Even as an average sized and middle aged adult (albeit with back issues), I could have slept up there but it wasn't easy to get in and out.  Older adults or adults with limited mobility might have issues on the top bunk.  The top bunk had a single pillow, bottom sheet, top sheet, and blanket.  The lower bunks were easy and probably could fit two smaller people.  Its not quite a ""full"" bed but wider than a twin and came with two pillows, bottom sheet, top sheet, and blanket.  Here is where we were glad that we had only backpacks and a small cooler.  Once the beds are folded down, there is little space for stuff.  

The bathrooms are narrow and contain a toilet and handheld shower.  Its tight.  I showered when we arrived in Sanford and it was functional.  Again, passengers of size will have a different experience.  The toilets flush with a sonic boom.  

The kids slept great.  My SO and I have had better nights.  Being on the second floor of the train car meant that we didn't have a ton of rail noise.  We were toward the rear of the train and I didn't notice the train's horn at night.  Being on the second level, we did notice significant swaying on turns.  It was fine and honestly probably as good as I would have slept in a hotel.  

The next morning we were woken up around 6am by an announcement.  It seems we were early to Florida and it was time for breakfast.  We pushed the attendant call button and went to the dining car.  We had the options for a quiche, egg sandwich, or cereal.  The cereal options were Apple Cinnamon Cheerios or Raisin Bran.  I got an egg sandwich and it was your typical microwaved from frozen type of sandwich you'd get in a gas station.  There were also bananas and prewrapped coffee cakes on the table for us. Coffee, milk, and orange juice was served.  

By the time we got back to the room, we were pulling into Sanford and had to get our stuff together.  Use the restroom when you get back because the plumbing will stop working when they disconnect cars.  We got off the train when called by the attendant, and headed into the terminal.

**On Board Tips:**

1. Bring as little as possible.  All your ""stuff"" should be in your car.  One set of PJs, one set of clothes for tomorrow, and wear shoes that slip on and off.  Toiletries needed for a night.  The showers have soap, shampoo, and conditioner.  
2. Have whatever electronics/books you need to stay entertained.  This meant laptops, ipads, and headphones plus chargers for each.  Cell service was good for much of the trip, but we downloaded movies to devices anyway.  
3. Try to do everything in backpacks.  
4. Bring snacks.  We brought a backpack cooler too which was nice.  
5. Stop at the lounge car if you want a second drink.  I asked for another at dinner and it was a bit of a thing.  There was a price for it on the menu but it didn't seem like they had the capability for me to pay for it.  It was awkward.   Better yet, bring a small cooler and your drink of choice in there.
6. Have cash for gratuities.  You should tip your room attendant and the dining car staff.  

**Unloading in Sanford**

The terminal was immediately crowded.  People also crowded around the car unload area.  We had priority unload so we stood outside as well.  If we did not have priority, I would have stayed in the air-conditioning.  Pull up your destination on your phone's GPS before you get your car.  They want you to jump in and roll to make space for the next passenger.  You don't need to show your vehicle claim slip but have that number handy so you know when your car is called.  

\--------------------------------------

We felt a little more prepared for our return trip.  This will be a bit shorter but we did learn a few things.

**Arriving in Sanford**

Much like in Lorton, we stopped for a paper sack lunch and then drove to the station.  We checked in at the drive up booth and were given a magnet and the slip.  We arrived early again because we weren't sure about dinner and if we'd get lucky again.  This time were were prepared and simply opened the doors, grabbed our backpacks from the floorboard around us, and off we went.  No opening the rear hatch!  

I checked in and was pleased to find that we had been set aside for the 6pm dinner. Sweet!  I asked how that happened and the person said that they ""try to do that for families"".  Does this mean that if you have young kids that you could come screeching in at the last second and get an early dinner?  I dunno man.  I'm not risking it but I will ask the reservation person next time.  

We learned too late that the city of sanford runs a shuttle from the station into downtown and back for free.  I wish we would have done this.  Would have been nice to do something other than sit around for 2.5 hours.  

By 2:30, crowds had formed on the platform (we were guilty) waiting to board.  We got on board and found that this car was a little more updated.  Vinyl seats instead of cloth.  The sofa reclined (to be faiiiiirrr the others might have too and we didn't notice).  Even the chair opposite the couch was more comfortable.  Our room divider was closed which was a bummer but the attendant eventually came by to open it.  

**Northbound trip**

We didn't depart until 4pm this time and I had read on Wikipedia that the autotrain is usually late so I was fearing a late arrival in DC.   After dinner, we stopped in the lounge car for a second beverage and walked back to our compartments.   

That night we drove through quite a bit of weather.  It was windy and rainy and I think the wind caused some more sway.  Our car was closer to the front than last time and the horn woke me up a couple times.   

Despite the weather and ""late"" start, we arrived in Lorton at 7am.  Two hours early.  The staff hadn't even arrived in Lorton yet so we couldn't get off the train until 8:15.   Process was as expected and we were off into the world of DC traffic.  

**Some interesting tidbits we learned**

* The stateroom attendants and dining staff work two days on, two days off.  They arrive at their ""base"" (Florida or VA) and prep the cars for the departing trip.  They stay on the train that night and then work the next day too cleaning when we depart and serving the next trip of customers.  They stay that night on the train and then are back at their base.  They have two days off and then start again.  
* The conductors and engineers only work 8 hour shifts.  They work from the point of departure until we reach Florence, South Carolina around 10pm.  They get off the train and get a hotel.  They have 24 hours off in Florence and then get back on the train the next night at 10pm and work until we arrive back at their base.  

\------------------------------

We really enjoyed our trip and plan to take the autotrain again as long as we have the time in our schedules and it continues to be comparable in price to flying/renting.  Hope this helps someone else prep for their trip!

1ltyr26,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ltyr26/has_anyone_heard_of_a_town_called_doveland/,Has anyone heard of a town called Doveland?,"So, something strange happened to me today and I wonder if anyone can shed some light on what I found. I drive a lot for work, small trucks delivering stuff between warehouses owned by my company but for the most part, I only drive within Ohio and occasionally over the state line to one of our branches in PA. But for the past week I’ve been driving cross country, how did this start? Well my boss I’ll call him B asked me if I would be willing to fly to New York and pick up a truck there and drive it to Seattle.


As weird as that probably sounds, B is a good guy, and a great boss so I agreed. I know him well enough to know it’s nothing illegal and he was offering to pay me double, plus expenses for every day I was on the road. I figured it would take around a week at most, plus he offered to give me the next week off so I gladly agreed. 



I got into NY around midnight and some guy met me with the truck I was to drive at the airport. I drove it to Philadelphia, called B to let him know how far I’d gotten, and then crashed at a cheap motel. Other than the innate oddness of the request nothing strange happened that night or for the next few after, until I reached Wisconsin. 



Has anyone ever heard of a town called Doveland? I just passed through, and I don’t think it was real. 


It was getting late and I was looking for a place to turn in for the night when I saw the turnoff sign for Doveland, the sign said there was a motel in town so I decided I had gone far enough and would try and get some sleep, but when I entered town it was… well it was strange is the only way I can really think to describe it.


I want you to do a little experiment for me, go on one of those AI image generators and give it a prompt like “generic small town american main street” see what it spits out? That is what this Doveland place was like. What I mean is that everything looked right at a distance but it gave off a really strange vibe, and when I got closer all the small details made no sense. For example, buildings would change material or architectural style seemingly at random, some of the doors had no handles, others too many, or in the wrong place, and weirdest of all, the signs were all nonsense. 


One building had a marquee like an old movie theater that said “Drug Storee”, weird spelling of Store aside that wasn’t that strange but as I got closer I saw smaller text underneath it that was unreadable, just jumbles of letters and numbers that vaguely resembled prices at a distance, same goes for everything in town. The gas station’s sign said “Gaz: 000 por leet” Or at least that’s what it looked like, all the letters were misshapen and oddly drawn, like the font they used was designed by an illiterate.



I tried to call B and let him know I was stopping for the night then, but instead of ringing or a “no signal” tone, I got elevator music like I was on hold. I tried again and the same thing happened, just bad jazz music. Out of curiosity, I tried a couple more numbers like my girlfriend and the pizza place near where I live, but nothing. Or rather, the same thing, just that music again. 



Things only got stranger as I drove through town, no people were out, I mean nobody! I didn’t see a single human being in town. And the few parked cars I passed were all old boxy sedans, they looked 80s vintage, but none of them had any badges or logos that I could see, and all the plates were blank white with black numbers, not real state plates. The numbers were weird too, just sequential digits in the same bizarre font, everyone I passed going higher. 01, 02, 03 like that. 



I never found the motel, I just kept driving until I got out of town then found my way back onto the interstate and kept going until I reached the next town. Some little place called Cottage where I am now. They had a little all-night diner and I’m sitting at a booth there writing this now, thing is when I asked the locals if they could tell me anything about Doveland the waitress nearly spilled a pot of coffee and several old timers gave me really strange looks, then they all started talking over each other assuring me that no such place existed. 
 

They know something, and I don’t think I’m welcome here anymore.

Suddenly facing the daunting prospect of either finding a new roommate or a more affordable place to live, Jordan’s stress levels reach a boiling point.

Noémie St. Pierre is a customer from hell. Every weekday morning, Noémie struts into the coffee shop like she owns the place and often makes a fuss. Jordan can’t stand the woman.

But Noémie’s life isn’t as perfect as it seems, and when her father-founder of the globally expanding Poutine Heaven franchise-cuts off her financial support, Noémie’s world is turned upside down. Desperate, Noémie gets a job at the coffee shop, and upon learning of Jordan’s housing woes, proposes they move in together. Reluctantly, Jordan agrees.

1ltyp1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1ltyp1i/betterme_beginners_fasting_schedule/,BetterMe: Beginners' Fasting Schedule,"If you’re curious about intermittent fasting (IF) but not sure where to start, you’re not alone. IF has become a popular way to improve health, balance digestion, and manage weight—not by changing *what* you eat, but *when* you eat.

For beginners, choosing the right fasting schedule can make or break your experience. Here's a breakdown of the top fasting methods, their benefits, potential struggles, and how to ease into the process without burnout.

# ✅ 3 Best Intermittent Fasting Schedules for Beginners

**1. 12:12 Method (Fast 12 hrs, Eat 12 hrs)**  
*Example: Finish dinner by 7 PM, eat breakfast at 7 AM*

* **Why it works**: Mirrors your natural sleep/eating cycle
* **Pros**: Easy to start, minimal disruption
* **Cons**: Late-night snacks can interfere
* **Tips**: Stick to consistent dinner times and hydrate before bed

**2. 14:10 Method (Fast 14 hrs, Eat 10 hrs)**  
*Example: Stop eating at 8 PM, eat at 10 AM*

* **Why it works**: Gentle intro to extended fasting
* **Pros**: Helps manage hunger without skipping meals
* **Cons**: Morning fatigue if not hydrated or nourished
* **Tips**: Delay breakfast gradually and drink water or tea in the morning

**3. 16:8 Method (Fast 16 hrs, Eat 8 hrs)**  
*Example: Fast from 8 PM to 12 PM*

* **Why it works**: Can enhance fat-burning and insulin sensitivity
* **Pros**: Popular and potentially effective for weight loss
* **Cons**: Skipping breakfast is tough for some
* **Tips**: Plan nutrient-dense meals, use coffee/tea to curb hunger, stay flexible

# 🍽️ What Should You Eat Before Fasting?

Eating the right foods before your fast can help you stay full longer and avoid energy crashes. Here’s a balanced plate:

* **Protein**: Eggs, chicken, salmon, tofu, Greek yogurt
* **Healthy fats**: Avocado, nuts, olive oil
* **Complex carbs**: Sweet potatoes, oats, brown rice
* **Fiber-rich foods**: Vegetables, legumes, whole grains
* **Hydration**: Water, herbal teas, water-dense fruits (e.g., cucumber, watermelon)

✅ *Avoid sugary snacks and ultra-processed foods that spike and crash blood sugar.*

❔❔ Do you prefer to skip breakfast or dinner—and why?

I’ve never really used credit cards seriously before, just had one for emergencies, but this time I wanted something that could give me a little back without feeling like a hassle to manage.

The card came in pretty quick (like 4 days), and I started using it for just normal stuff such as groceries, coffee, gas, even a few random Amazon orders. Nothing crazy. What surprised me most is how fast the cashback added up. I think I spent around $1,100 for the month (normal stuff, no big purchases) and I already saw a solid amount sitting in my cashback balance. That 1.5% on everything adds up way faster than I thought, especially when you're not chasing categories or doing mental math.

I also like that it doesn’t make me think too much. Just swipe and earn. The app is clean and shows rewards right away, and I set up auto-pay so I don’t mess anything up. I’m trying to build better habits with money and this feels like a decent step. No annual fee either, so I don’t feel like I’m under pressure to “justify” having the card.

Kinda curious though, do most people use this card just for the flat 1.5%, or is there a smarter way to mix it with other Chase cards for better rewards? I keep hearing about these Chase trifectas but haven’t looked into it much yet. Anyone here using it as their main card long term?",1,1751905621.0,credit_cards,0,1.0,False

1ltyo4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedScrotumSyndrome/comments/1ltyo4a/cure_story/,“Cure” Story,"Haven’t been on this acct in a while and wanted to provide an update.

This thing cleared up once on its own and is currently in a totally tolerable place. I don’t think about it that much anymore - that’s how comfortable things are.

Both times all I did was basically surrender and take up a very demanding physical job. First time was landscaping - this time it’s driving for Amazon (I sprint from van to each door to make more $$).

I shower once a day with dermaharmony zinc soap on the balls.

I make sure to always clean up with the same soap after anything unhygienic (sex, dirty hands touch balls for some reason, etc).

 I apply pure talc powder I order on Amazon anytime I go out wearing exofficio give and go sport briefs, which I also work in all day long. I keep things dry but don’t focus so much on the issue that I’m prompted to over powder.

At home I go commando unless I need to do any form of activity (then I’m in the sport briefs).

I always make sure to go to bed showered and clean etc.

I don’t overthink or over focus on the condition at all though - I think the physical job takes the mind off of it and allows the brain-nerve connection to calm down a little bit.

I can’t say I’m ever 100% - but it’s a constant and basically permanent 80% improvement. If anything comes along and destroys the skin barrier I’d be back to square one.

I eat lunch (first meal of the day) around 2pm and am sure to consume sardines (fish oil) and bread-carbs to hydrate my skin from the inside out.

I work out vigorously to stay sane.

At night I supplement with zinc, collagen powder, sometimes magnesium. In the morning I have coffee and a b complex. 

Each night I eat more than 1 pound of red meat - makes me feel amazing (genetic thing I’m sure).

My thighs are messed up from topical steroids - possibly permanently. And this is the greatest source of depression / anguish. It’s something I’ll have to cope with probably for the rest of my life. Constant discomfort basically and difficulty getting around without specialized underwear. However I have purpose and devote my life to the things I truly value and even have a hot girlfriend somehow. 

You can still pursue your dreams - and remember that good women value what’s inside. Sometimes it just takes a while for them to figure out who you are / your value.

Edit: I wanted to add something I think is absolutely essential - to be able to cope with this mentally you need to do everything you can to maximize your testosterone. Need feel-good hormones. For me that’s intense, heavy exercise; over-consuming red meat; the supplements; semen retention (I know how this sounds, trust me); and just monitoring how I feel / what I’m doing and eating with a spreadsheet. You’ll learn a lot about your body this way. The feeling you’re going for is what the Greeks called “Thymos” or “Thumos.” ",3,1751905588.0,RedScrotumSyndrome,0,0.8,False

Backstory- my dad (65yo) had a heart attack last November. He ended up needing 6 stents placed. He had smoked and drank for the better part of his life and after his heart attack, he gave both up cold turkey. He the past ~9 months he has really struggled with anxiety. He is nervous and anxious about everything. He also cant sleep. He’s gained probably 30lb. He’s been going to cardiac rehabilitation 3x a week, and oddly enough, enjoys it. 

Well last week he had a seizure. No hx of seizures. The day prior he was working outside, getting some things done around the pool. Next day he slept nearly all day. Woke up around 10 to have coffee. Felt nauseated, so he went back to bed for the rest of the day. Around 4 he came out of his bedroom and my mom said he just acted weird. Wasn’t really with it. Said he was still nauseous, so again went back to bed. Well my mom followed him in and when she walked in he was laying in bed and his whole body was jerking and spit was coming out of his mouth. So she called 911, they took him in. They did blood work, head CT, head MRI, all came back fine. They admitted him because they didn’t know the cause and didn’t feel comfortable sending him home. They are just waiting to see the results from the brain wave test (? Unsure what the name of this one is, apologies). They are 99% positive he had a seizure but they have no idea what the cause of it was. Is there such a thing where people his age just have one for no apparent reason? 

He’s on a slew of medication. He takes meds for BP, blood thinners, lexapro for his anxiety, those are the ones I know of off the top of my head. Oh, he’s also taking something to help him sleep, unsure of the name. 

Pending the results of the brain wave test, any advice?

He recommended that I follow a 16-hour fasting routine, completely eliminate sugar, and avoid meat to help reduce inflammation. I was also told that coffee is okay with a small amount of full-fat milk, but not almond milk since most commercial brands are highly processed and contain preservatives.

In terms of treatment, Tepezza isn’t available in my country, but Tocilizumab is—although it’s not covered by insurance. The specialist also suggested trying four sessions of Tocilizumab therapy, but it’s still not FDA-approved for TED, so it won’t be covered either. I’m currently applying for charity support locally in hopes of getting some financial assistance. It is very expensive but Tepezza is even more expensive.

If anyone else has gone through similar experiences with TED, fasting, or alternative therapies, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts 💙

I am 34. I am 6 feet, 220 pounds. I am DDF and single. South Asian, if that matters.
I keep myself physically and mentally fit. I hit the gym regularly. I recently dropped from a 3XL to an XL shirt. I swim 3 hours twice a week. This focus translates to everything I do.
I am looking for a real connection. I want something regular and ongoing. I value genuine hanging out. I am tired of superficial interactions. I want something that feels real.
I bring passion and attentiveness to all my connections. I focus on creating memorable experiences. I take my time to truly understand you. Your comfort is important.

I love exploring new cooking recipes. I keep my mind sharp. I host a podcast. I write poetry. I am even trying stand up comedy. I am quick witted. I love making people laugh. I am always present. I also love walking around and exploring Toronto.

What really gets me is chemistry. The kind that feels like a secret. The kind that holds you after. It makes you think of me mid laugh the next day.

Let's start with a coffee or drinks, dance away all night.

What kind of connection are you looking for? What has your heart and mind been waiting for?
Let's exchange pics and make a good story.",0,1751905154.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,0.5,False
