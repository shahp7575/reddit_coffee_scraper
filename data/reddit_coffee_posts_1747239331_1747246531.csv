For dinner I normally do salmon or chicken with broccoli or avocado and white rice. I skip lunch Sunday-Friday.

I have also began strength training and running a lot more, 6 days a week. 3 days I do running and strength training, I also go on a mile walk on my lunch break or after dinner each day. As of recent I have been running longer, 3 miles a day . During the day, my fasting period between breakfast and dinner I have been getting extremely hungry. Before the past 2 weeks my hunger was suppressed by drinking more water or a black coffee, but that has not worked for the past 2 weeks.

Partner would rather not keep buying plastic bottles of Crystal Geyser. 

Have a GH/KH tester recommender here. Tap seems btw 100-200ppm on both. But I have no idea what this means. 

To judge from my electric kettle and really everything else, water is very very hard here. 

I am not generally disposed to worry about drinking tap water; my concern here is for my machine. 

My sense is that calcium is good to drink, but not for machines. Between that and the expense, I'm not that thrilled with the idea of converting the whole kitchen sink to de-calciumed water in some way. I mean, if you insist that is the way, do explain. 

What should I really be testing with? GH/KH? Something else? Really lost there.

Not super thrilled about trips to the story myself with a giant refillable jug. No one's back here is in such great shape that we are eager for all this carrying of super heavy things. 

Might a BWT filter do the trick for us? Like, in a pitcher for example? I understand this would change out the calcium for magnesium. This sounds great for coffee? But how then can I tell it is working well enough? Would whatever tester I have still test it as high in minerals?

Apologies for being so lost here, and thanks for any help or reference to resources.

To achieve and maintain ketosis, it’s essential to eat the right types of foods.

# ✅ Foods You Can Eat on the Keto Diet

# 1. Healthy Fats

Fats are the cornerstone of the keto diet, making up about 70–80% of your daily calorie intake.

* **Avocados**
* **Olive oil**
* **Coconut oil**
* **Butter and ghee**
* **Nuts and seeds** (e.g., almonds, chia seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts)
* **Nut butters** (unsweetened)

# 2. Protein (Moderate Amounts)

Aim for high-quality protein to support muscle mass without disrupting ketosis.

* **Meat**: beef, pork, lamb
* **Poultry**: chicken, turkey
* **Fish**: salmon, sardines, mackerel (especially fatty fish)
* **Eggs**: pasture-raised or organic when possible

# 3. Low-Carb Vegetables

Focus on non-starchy vegetables that are high in fiber and nutrients but low in carbs.

* **Leafy greens**: spinach, kale, romaine
* **Cruciferous vegetables**: broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts
* **Zucchini**, **bell peppers**, **asparagus**, **mushrooms**, **cucumbers**

# 4. Full-Fat Dairy (If tolerated)

Choose dairy products that are low in carbs and free of added sugar.

* **Cheese** (cheddar, mozzarella, goat cheese)
* **Heavy cream**
* **Greek yogurt** (unsweetened, full-fat)
* **Cream cheese**

# 5. Berries (In Moderation)

Most fruits are too high in carbs, but berries are an exception in small portions.

* Sugar and sugary foods (cakes, candy, soda)
* Starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas)
* Most fruits (bananas, apples, grapes)
* Processed foods and snacks

# 🧠 Summary

On the **keto diet**, you eat **low-carb, high-fat foods** like **meat, fish, eggs, healthy oils, full-fat dairy, non-starchy vegetables, and some nuts**. The goal is to minimize carbs (typically under 50g net carbs/day) to trigger **ketosis**, where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.",1,1747246239.0,EarnFitZone,0,1.0,False

Pt14

Jamie was a little shocked to say the least, the last he had seen of this man he was on death's door, now he was demanding coffee in a room that Jamie had no idea how he'd gotten to and acting like nothing had happened. 

“Crud. Fine, I'll make it” grumbled Reggie as he slowly stood up, groaning and moved gingerly towards a machine that Jamie had never seen before and seeing his wide eyes explained “Suppose you never seen one of these. It's a universal fountain. Anything water based, it'll make it… Or at least a close approximation of it. You gotta ask it specifically to add caffeine otherwise it gives you decaff sludge” he said his face scrunching in disgust. 

Jamie slowly began to take in his room, calming down as he identified things that he could recognise and began to move to the table perching on the chair, still not at ease in Reggie’s presence. The walls were the same bluish silver metal as the rest of the ship, but there were small touches here and there to make it habitable. There were small shelves built into the wall next to the strangely ovoid shaped bed, the table and chairs were plain but functional and comfortable and cupboards either side of the door Jamie supposed was probably a wash room of some kind. He noticed that everything large seemed to have buttons on a screen, with characters in a language he couldn't understand. 

Reggie returned with two cups of coffee from the machine and, noticing Jamie's interest in the screens “They're for changing the shape to suit the species” he said, groaning as he sat opposite Jamie, sipping his coffee and sighing with the same tone that you'd expect from someone who hadn't had a drop of water in 3 weeks suddenly drinking a mug of pure glacier water. “Here, watch this” he said as he leaned over and used the slider bar to shuffle through the characters on the screen on the bed until the characters changed to silhouettes, then pressed the largest button. 

The look on Jamie's face must have been priceless as the bed immediately began to shift and ripple, the bed widening and lowering into a flat mat on the floor, barely 2 inches thick, seemingly made of a spongey material. “That's the bed those wrinkly Thaleans prefer” he said laughing as Jamie's mouth hung agape. Jamie, stood up and stretched out a hand to test the new bed, his hand immediately hitting the floor as he applied pressure. 

“I can't sleep on this” he said, still clearly amazed but now with a hint of concern in his voice as he looked at the screen and replicated the movement that Reggie had done until he found an approximate likeness of human proportions, then pressed the big button, jumping back to observe the bed, rippling and shifting once more until it resembled something more akin to a giant beanbag. “This is standard now?” he said looking at Reggie, who just chuckled and gestured to Jamie's coffee, inviting him to sit. 

“Not quite, you're an honoured guest now, so you get the good stuff” Reggie replied, sipping his coffee once more, savouring the rich, earthy flavour. “You got any idea what we just did?”. Jamie merely shook his head as he sipped the hot coffee. “Well, let me tell you, everyone here is safe now cause of us”. 

“We took out a monster. Done it loads of times” replied Jamie, eyeing Reggie, noting the new scars up his neck. The thing had nearly killed him and here we are sitting in a room having a coffee, this is insane, thought Jamie. 

“Well I'll clue you in. What we just took care of was a Sarlan like all the rest you've seen here, but infected with a dangerous parasite” said Reggie, chuckling as Jamie's eyes widened and he checked himself “It don't affect us! It's something that only affects Dracorlix and Sarlans for some reason. Apparently it's the Aluminium content of ‘em. Sarlans that are infected go insane and eventually become tough as nails to kill, whereas Dracorlix have more of a symbiotic relationship with it. But the result is the same to a degree, they both need aluminium to create their inner structures. Bones to you and I”.

Jamie sat, brow furrowed as he thought back to the fight, remembering how the creature seemed to have a mouthful of metal even as it was fighting the two of them. “That's why it ate the blasters” he mused aloud, his face framed by his long, lank hair, concentration written all over it “I thought it was just smart, getting rid of the danger”. 

“Unfortunately not, they just eat any and all aluminium they can, it rapidly replaces their inner plates and becomes their teeth as they regress through their evolution” said the old medic forlornly “That one was what used to be our Captain. Was hoping I could get to him in time, must have gotten infected with it a while ago though as by the time I got to the bridge ‘the turn’ had almost taken place completely. We were lucky he hadn't had a few more hours chewing on stuff” he said sipping his coffee thoughtfully. 

Jamie sat there, the news of this not really settling on him at all. He wasn't sure if he should feel bad, he'd never met the guy and last he'd known of it his kind were his sworn enemies. He settled on the fact that he'd taken care of a monster, it was simpler and Jamie liked it simple. 

“Now, I was hoping you'd say a bit more, maybe have some questions for me? Feel like I'm rambling on here” said Reggie, with a raised eyebrow. He had to get through, he needed Jamie to be, at the very least, on board with him for his plan to work. 

“I… Uh… is Ju'ut okay?” said Jamie finally. His demeanor hard to read. 

“She's fine, very busy for the moment but fine. As are the rest of the folks on the ship to be honest, fixing the damage we caused and making her space worthy again” shrugged Reggie, with a warm smile “But all alive thanks to the two of us”. 

Jamie nodded, glad to hear that she was okay “You mentioned Dracorlecks, what are they exactly?” he asked, his brow furrowing once more. 

“Dracorlix” corrected Reggie off handedly “Was wondering if you'd ask about that, why don't I show you instead? My friend Dorian would love to pop by, but they are quite fragile, so I'd have to ask you not to touch them. Does that sound good?” said Reggie, with an almost parent-like tone in his voice. He seemed to be enjoying chatting with Jamie like this. “Don't stress, he's friendly and a decent guy besides that”. 

Jamie grew slightly tense, but resolutely nodded and replied “Fine. Where?”.

“Well he can be here in a couple of minutes if I call him or you want to clean up a bit first?” said Reggie, eyeing Jamie's unkempt hair and long beard “Plenty of cleaning stuff in the bathroom and I've seen my fair share of bunk rooms to not be intimidated by another man's nakedness” he laughed jovially. 

“Wash… Please” said Jamie, the me rest hint of shyness creeping into his voice. Or was he ashamed? “Could you help me?” Jamie suddenly didn't look like a 6 foot tall, muscular gorilla of a man, he looked like a man who is lost. Reggie couldn't do anything but nod and help, saying nothing, realising that this was a huge step towards Jamie trusting him. Once they had cleaned Jamie's hair and beard and he'd had a shower he looked like a new man. 

“There are probably a couple of different styles of clothes in that cupboard over there son, find something you like” said Reggie, studying his mostly empty cup of coffee as Jamie changed, smiling internally at the small victory. 

Jamie turned finally and said “Not sure they fit”. 

As Reggie looked up he couldn't help but burst into laughter at the sight that greeted him. Jamie stood there, 250 pounds of angry muscular man, wet hair framing his rugged face, his wet, bushy beard still slightly damp and shining in the light with what could only be described as shorts that looked as though they were attempting to choke the life out of Jamie's buttocks and thighs and a crop top that barely covered his hairy belly button. 

“Very funny, new clothes please” said Jamie as the seams began to rip on cue, prompting more guffaws from Reggie. 

“Sorry bud, but that was incredible” said Reggie, tears streaming from his eyes as he stood up to help Jamie programme the cupboard. A couple of minutes later Jamie had picked out a loose fitting shirt and shorts, with a belt and Reggie had even managed to source a code for a scabbard that would fit Jamie's knife, assuming they could get it back. 

“Right then, I'll call Dorian” said Reggie, to a stern nod from Jamie.

I miss making a woman feel loved and so many other aspects of a relationship. I’ve been single and have been focusing on myself this year, but I can’t help but think about having a life partner. With it almost being my birthday it’s been heavy on my mind.

I’m incredibly affectionate, and I love words of affirmation. I express all love languages because I don’t believe in being dead set on one. I miss being held by another woman and holding them in return. I miss having intellectual conversations with someone who can also be a silly goose with me. I’m a texter, so you’ll never be left on read for long, and one of my biggest focuses is having effective communication when a situation arises. 

A little about me: I’ve lived in plenty of states ranging from the east to the west and then back to the east. I’m an avid traveler and will take a spontaneous road trip with you at any time (Can I drive though?). I’m 5’10 with tattoos. I love creating art and working with my hands and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours. I’m attentive and all about attention to detail when caring for someone, friends, family, or lover.

Sexually, I am attracted to femme lesbian as mentioned above. They make my heart go boom boom boom. Would love to be with someone who is a switch because sharing is caring, but I don’t mind being the dom for the majority of the time if we click and that’s what you prefer. Definitely kink friendly and can’t go through another vanilla relationship. 

Love to geek out with games when I have time. Watching horror movies, documentaries, or just a Disney movie will do. Music is pretty huge in my life and I’m almost always wearing my headphones. I love to propagate plants and gift them to everyone. I’m huge on having my morning coffee and evening tea during my self-care routine. Being outdoors is my haven as long as it’s not during the summer in an Arizona (did that for like seven years 🫠).  I’m looking to go back to school for either visual arts or IT this Fall. 



Anyway, I would love to get to know someone and have great banter with. Let’s see where this goes!

The cool night air was refreshing. Wisps of clouds swallowed most of the moon, casting a bruised kind of darkness over the world. On the back balcony of her apartment, Michelle sat in a folding lawn chair, a paper cup of cold coffee clutched in both hands. She stared blankly into the night while her insides writhed like a sack of coiling, angry snakes.

She had accepted Liz into her home because family takes care of family. That’s what she told herself. That’s what she was told to believe. Every day she tried to believe it a little harder.

There were nights Liz would toss and turn, caught in nightmares so violent they seemed to rattle the very walls. Michelle could do nothing but listen, wide-eyed and sleepless, as the woman she was supposed to protect unraveled thread by thread. The guilt was suffocating.

They had known each other as children — or so Michelle was told. The first few weeks together were awkward, stilted. Conversations felt too polite, too formal, like two strangers trying to convince themselves they had once been friends. Whatever bond existed for the two in youth did not appear to have survived the intervening years.
It seemed hopeless until the day Liz dragged her on a long-overdue shopping trip.

Liz had saved a little money and Michelle agreed that five years without retail therapy was basically a crime against humanity. She chauffeured Liz from store to store until they finally ended up at a massive thrift shop near the county line — a sprawling, musty place that smelled like old denim and forgotten Christmas decorations.
That’s where Liz found them. The shoes. The ugliest pair of shoes Michelle had ever seen — a poisonous shade of green that looked like someone had skinned Kermit the Frog. Michelle laughed out loud, certain it was a joke.
When she realized Liz was serious, her heart cracked open just a little.

“You cannot be serious,” Michelle had scoffed, half-laughing, half-pleading. “You want to wear Muppet skin shoes?”

Liz grinned, wide and mischievous. “Absolutely.”
Despite Michelle's best efforts to talk her out of it, Liz bought the hideous things and wore them out of the store like a badge of honor. It was stupid and sweet and somehow perfect.

That was the moment Michelle felt it snap into place — like a hook set too deep to pull free. She could see Liz not as a duty, not as an obligation, but as something unbearably rare: a true friend.
Maybe her only real one.

Michelle sat alone now on the balcony, shivering under the weight of what might be yet to come. Was the connection they rebuilt strong enough to save either of them?

I'm currently on hour ~~3 4 5~~ 6 with some breaks, and I'm trying to fix the run-on and half sentences as I go back and re-read, but I'm working on no sleep, no coffee, and <100 calories in the past 48 hours. I'm a mess, and I'm just about out of fucks to give.

Some things to state because I can't find a good place to slip them in; my wife admitted last night that one method she uses to “get over things” is to put it out of her memory (no wonder her parents have walked and continue to walk all over her). While that's probably healthier than my Au-ADHD method of holding on to things, it means I can recall events and statements (and broken promises) very easily, and the pain, anger, and frustration are freshly applied each time they get brought out; but my wife's ability to recall *anything* is admittedly to her less than stellar.

Also, me: 41M, HL; wife: 41F, LL. Married 19 years, no kids, but her parents live with us and I think are 1000x worse than having twin 4 year olds. For starters, four year olds would be fine watching Bluey or whatever I put on for them, not bitch at me about being “woke” then changing the channel to Newsmax… ugh…



I'm done. I am just… done.

We had an argument this morning over multiple things; mostly stemming from the fact that I don't feel heard, appreciated, or loved. Then as if to accentuate my point, my wife was comically getting ready to leave the house with me, drop me off at work, and take the car today despite that not even 10 minutes earlier we had finished a convo where I had said tomorrow was a better day because I was in training all morning and would be stuck in the office. She claimed she didn't hear me properly because I was mumbling; which would truly be hilarious if she hadn't done the exact same thing again yesterday when we were discussing the basement remodel. It really was a true CEO moment where she suddenly had a great suggestion on the layout, which was hilarious because I was able to ask “you mean like this?” and pulled up the file I had just closed after discussing the pros/cons for the past 15 minutes on the exact suggestion she had made but somehow missed, jumped off to another topic, and ran out of the room to grab something unrelated to the discussion as a whole. Uh huh… mumbling…

That of course devolved into a DB argument that I just walked away from, and I feel completely defeated and shut down.

1st, we have a shared doc from a year ago stating all sorts of things that we've discussed regarding the DB. The easiest of hurdles to identify was the frequency, which she uses as a source of excuses all the time. “I never know when to talk about these things because you're always in a bad mood when we do” is one I hear a lot after a lengthy pause, and I've lost track of the amount of times I've responded with “sometime between 2 days and 2 months would be appreciated, and the closer to 2 months it gets the more likely I'll feel too hurt to want to bother.” Yeah, I get depressed, hurt, and angry when I'm physically ignored or worse, teased like I was 2 weeks ago, and it continues to eat at me when nothing happens or is said about it for weeks afterwards. She doesn't understand why I'm hurt, or why I lash out with sarcasm the longer we go with zero intimacy. She also doesn't seem to understand that the very few times I've turned her down have either been within 24 hrs of an argument and are an obvious panic response, or have been after weeks to months of radio silence, and that the amount of rejection she experiences from me doesn't even come close to the amount that I experience from her.

After that was communication and scheduling; years of neglect and denial have taken their toll on my self esteem and confidence. Yes, that's a “me” problem, and I had asked for her help on improving that, starting with her letting me know early enough in the day that she's interested in trying later. Additionally, her parents live with us (another horror story with compounded issues that tie into this one), so some obvious days to start with would be ones that they're out of the house late… currently Tuesdays and Thursdays. The best offer I've gotten since writing that was for a post-work shower, suggested to me 2 hours before the end of work. She doesn't understand that acting flippant about planning intimacy and ignoring my needs hurts me, and shows that she doesn't put enough emphasis in resolving this issue. She also doesn't understand that my internal demons fill the void left by the lack of communication with the greatest hits playlist of all my past failures and shortcomings to justify the behavior. “She doesn't want me, I disgust her. She thinks this is all guys ever want from women.""

She wanted suggestions as to where to start to show me that I'm wrong, that she's thinking of me and loves me; so I suggested sending texts throughout the day, particularly on Tues or Thurs ahead of some adult time without “the kids” (her parents)... I got gifs and stickers with cute pandas and such. Don't get me wrong, pandas are cute, fuzzy, and adorable, but I don't exactly get uh… excited… when I think of pandas (nothing against furries, but it's not my thing, to each their own. And no, my wife is also not a furry 🤣). It's not like I asked for spicy selfies or eggplant emojis, but something a bit more adult than a panda with the caption “I luv you beary much!” would be nice. If you were to look at our text history, it's very PG aside from my very colorful vocabulary (a running joke is I make her Navy friends blush). She doesn't understand that while I (used to) like to have fun and can be as much a kid at heart as she can, at some point you gotta mature a bit and act like an adult… I don't feel comfortable mixing cutesy with adult pastimes or behaviors. A simple “looking forward to tonight… 😉” would have sufficed, but it's either been cutesy or radio silence. Also severe depression will put a damper on any childish tendencies.

She wanted to know what “not being depressed” would look like, and asked why I can't let go of my pain and anger like she does (🤨). I explained for the umpteenth time that I'll let go of my anger when I have less to be actively angry about… I live in a house that I just purchased, but don't have any space or say over decor/layout because her parents are such goddamned narcissistic and greedy assholes who claim counter space in their name faster than Columbus; who gorge themselves on pizza and other food I order and finish it before I get a 3rd slice; who instilled such a religious guilt in their daughter that 41 years later she can't give her husband of nearly 20 years anything more than a rough handjob once every few months. I live in a house where putting up a sign after months of asking for the dishwasher to be loaded rather than individually washing dishes gets me death glares from her mother, her father ignores requests of “don't put anything here, it'll break the garage door sensor” and proceeds to break the fucking sensor for the 6th time. I live in a house where my $500 grill gets used and left uncovered out in the rain and eventually snow for years on end but is only worth replacing with a <$100 charcoal grill when it breaks. 🤬 (Sorry, wrong sub, back on track now 🤣)

So this all gets hashed out again… and because we've had this exact argument, with the exact same points, with the exact outcome, down to the exact same set of offered solutions multiple times in the past few months… I naturally got upset. She responds with a “See? This is why I can't have this discussion with you. You always get upset and lash out at me. Why are you so angry all the time? Put yourself in my shoes… how would you feel?”

Oh, so this is where we're gonna go? Bring it.

“How would I feel if I ignored my spouse of 20 years and kept forgetting his needs? If I kept sabotaging planned date nights by falling asleep at the TV instead of doing the things I said I'd do to get ready? If I made disgusted faces when he asked for a BJ? If I made promises that I frequently broke? If I asked for the same considerations he asked me, like texting ahead of time, but I couldn't be bothered to return the favor? How would I feel if my spouse who wanted nothing more than physical attention and affection and was willing to do ANYTHING physical in reciprocation to me, got to the point of tearful begging because he felt so ignored? How would I feel if I led my spouse on for 20 years, promising to take things more seriously each time there's a breakdown, only to be content with a cuddle buddy? Because that's what it seems you want… a puppy dog or a teddy bear for you to hold when you're sad or lonely, not a husband or lover.”

She responds with “I wish you weren't so bothered by all this.”

“Why are you putting this on me? How is this my fault?”

“I'm not putting it on you, I just wish you would let this go so you're not as angry and hurting yourself over it.” (she doubled down on the statement but I forget exactly the wording at this point… I was about 5 minutes from needing to leave for work)

“Yes you are; your parents don't respect either of us enough to treat us with a thread of human decency, and it seems you want a stuffie for a husband, not a lover. Why shouldn't I be upset?”

“Is that what you think I want? A stuffie?”

“Yes! You've never asked for more, and this is where you pull our relationship back to every time we hit this stage… it's obviously comfortable and familiar to you. I have no reason any more to think you have any physical desire for me, especially when I'm answered with such a look of disgust and revulsion for asking for simple physical acts. One would've thought I had asked for some unspeakable situation from a Japanese porno…”

“You know I'm uncomfortable doing stuff…”

“Yes, and we've had 20 years to sort it out… but… whatever. When holding hands and kissing is foreplay, foreplay is sex, and sex is... well never.""

“You're going to be late for work. I don't want to talk about this while you're angry.”

“Talking about this while I'm in any other mood hasn't made a difference yet.” 🤷‍♂️



I'm done trying. I'm not heard, I'm not listened to, and what I have to say is not worth remembering. Doing something half-assed one time is good enough to dismiss everything I ask for or say I need, and rather than apologize for what I would assume should be very obvious shortcomings, I'm made to doubt myself and whether I'm in a position to be upset in the first place. My mental health has plummeted, I'm losing weight, and I don't see any outcome where I will be happy in life. Even if we agreed to open up the marriage, I don't want to go back out there; I quit drinking 6 years ago (sometimes I wonder if that was the best thing), so meeting people and socializing is a lot harder than it would've been otherwise, and I feel like a rejected loser who can't get laid by his own wife. My only hobbies are ones born out of desperation and isolation, and so aren't great places to meet people, and work… well, that's a catch-22. There's actually a few women who've been flirty (I think… I don't know if I would trust myself to know what real flirting looks like any more), but it's never a good idea to mix work and personal life, and I do not want to be *that* guy at work who doesn't get the hint or something, since clearly it's taken me 20 years to get the hint in this relationship...


At this point, I come home, vape enough weed to take the edge off of the depression, anger, guilt, whatever I don't want to bother feeling any more, then play video games by myself until it's time to go to bed. If it's Tues or Thurs I might ask her what happened, to which she'll usually say she forgot or was distracted by something else. She might go as far as to put a hand on my knee and tell me she misses me, but that's all I get.

And I'm expected to be happy like this. 😮‍💨",1,1747245944.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

I (24M) work at the local library and a girl passed by to ask if she could drop flyers for a festival in a nearby town. I said sure like an idiot lol, but it wasn’t up to me decide so I said ‘let’s just wait for my boss to conclude her business with the other client’. During this 2 minutes span we briefly talked about the festival, each other and i got to tell her what I studied, what I wanted to do for a living, and she told me what she studied, and the association she was in. So kind of small talk but still about each other. Then she got to talk to the boss, handed the flyers. She then left and waved me goodbye.

So I didn’t get her name, but I essentially knew she was about my age, and that we were interested in the same stuff (books among other things).

When I ended my shift I picked up a flyer and read through the thing. At the last page in the thanking section there was a list of names, so I randomly searched for the first name that appears and I actually found her instagram first thing on google.

So, would it be weird to message her or something ? Obviously i think she was very cute, and we shared interests therefore I though I could ask her if she wanted to grab a drink or a coffee sometime, and lastly tell her she could straight up ignore me if she wasn’t interested.

Or maybe I should follow her instead ?

The Hipster Synth Woman: Heather Sandra Wigston’s Analog Dreamscapes in a Digital Age


In the back corner of a well-worn brick-walled coffee shop, nestled among reclaimed wood, filament bulbs, and the clink of ceramic cups, you’ll find Heather Sandra Wigston — seated at her analog synthesizer, fingers dancing in quiet rebellion. Known to her devoted following as the Hipster Synth Woman, Heather’s weekend performances are part sonic tapestry, part social ritual — a ritual stitched from memory, solitude, and bold defiance.

Heather’s music — minimal yet richly layered, eerie yet oddly comforting — is born not of commercial ambition but from an intensely personal journey. A social worker by profession, Heather works closely with South Asian immigrant communities, bringing empathy, patience, and deep linguistic knowledge gained during her university studies in South Asian languages. It is a role she embraces with humility, her daytime hours spent navigating the real-world dissonances of culture, displacement, and human resilience.

But it’s the weekend afternoons where her alter ego blooms: surrounded by cables, analog knobs, and mismatched cushions, she performs without fanfare, her compositions drifting over the espresso machines and open books of her regular haunt. The audience? A modest but loyal cadre of ‘cosy corner’ regulars — artists, freelancers, and aging punks — who listen not with the hunger of consumers but with the reverence of community. Coffee and cake are offered in lieu of applause.

Heather’s relationship with the synthesizer traces back to her early twenties, when she played keyboards in a series of local rock bands. It was there, in the midst of electric guitars and fragile egos, that she discovered the sonic potential of analog synths — and the limits of tolerance for the machismo that often dominated the scene. Disillusioned and weary, she walked away, trading band rehearsals for academic quietude. But the music never left her.

Her compositions, now often inspired by the post-war avant-garde — Ligeti, Stockhausen, the forgotten edges of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop — ripple with quiet radicalism. These are not songs in the traditional sense. They are textures. Repetitions. Interruptions. Moods. At times, they echo the untranslatable melancholy of a raga filtered through the circuitry of a dying machine.

What sets Heather apart is not just her music, but the space she’s carved out for it. She plays unpaid. She plays unbothered. She plays unpartnered, having long shrugged off romantic entanglements as a distraction — and perhaps a residue of an early brush with sexism that never quite washed away. Her enduring independence is less a manifesto and more a lived truth. She answers to no scene, no label, no expectation.

And yet, somehow, she’s created a kind of scene of her own. The Hipster Synth Woman is not a viral sensation — and that’s precisely the point. In a world obsessed with metrics, Heather Wigston reminds us that some of the most meaningful artistic lives happen in miniature — over tea and drone, amid wires and warmth, in a corner where the avant-garde meets everyday grace.

*The heat started early this year.*

March, and already the pavement was soft beneath my shoes. The local news said it was unseasonably warm, but manageable. The mayor called it ***“a vibrant spring.”*** The headlines used words like balmy and sun-drenched.

No one said *record-breaking.* No one said *anomaly.*

The lake near our estate is gone. Not drained. Just… dried. The shoreline cracked like burnt skin. Ducks walk where they used to swim. People still bring bread and pretend it floats.

I stopped checking the weather. It always says the same thing.

***“Clear skies and high energy.”***
***“Bring sunscreen and a smile.”***
***“You can’t complain about the sunshine!”***

They don’t call it a drought anymore. It’s a radiant spell.

It wasn’t always like this.

There were protests at first. Sit-ins. Walkouts. Scientists begging for attention between segments on reusable coffee cups. But then the markets shifted. The messaging softened. Climate collapse was ***“economically counterproductive.”*** Panic made people shop less, vote strange.

So they rebranded it.

Newspapers stopped using fire maps. Forecasts switched from Celsius to *“comfort indices.”* Insurance companies pulled out of three entire regions, and the government called it ***“an opportunity to rethink community boundaries.”***

And now? Now the economy is booming.

At work, the air conditioning never kicks in. The thermostat shows 27 degrees, but HR says it’s ***“within the productivity sweet spot.”*** We’re allowed to bring water bottles now, as long as they’re branded.

One of the interns collapsed in the kitchen. Stood up too fast, then went straight down. She said she’d been dizzy for days. I heard her whisper, ***“It’s the air.”***

Security escorted her out.

The building manager sent an email afterward. Said she had a ***“personal adjustment episode.”*** Told us to hydrate. Attached a cartoon sun wearing sunglasses.

We all clicked ***“Thumbs up.”***

Outside, the roads shimmer. Tyres leave marks now, soft black smears like the city’s been crying in reverse. Birds sit with their beaks open. Bees disappear mid-flight.

But the billboards still show children on picnic blankets. Happy couples in convertibles. A man jogging past palm trees that don’t grow here.

Everything is too bright.

At night, the glow doesn’t fade. The sky stays orange well past midnight. Some say it’s city light. Others say it’s the air itself catching fire, slowly.

I don’t talk to my neighbours anymore. They hang foil in the windows. Not to block heat, but because they’re convinced the government is bouncing signals off their roof tiles. They could be right. Or not. It doesn’t matter.

We’re all trying to believe something.

This morning, a city drone hovered outside my flat. It spoke through a speaker in a child’s voice:
***“Don’t forget your sun-hat and positive attitude!”***

My neighbours clapped.

*I didn’t.*

The sun is still out.

It hasn’t rained in forty-two days.

But according to the forecast,

I’m gonna lay out my timeline - today is 5/14/25 for context for future readers (I have combed through old posts for hours trying to figure out people’s timelines and outcomes. I. Love. Data.). 

Would love to hear if anyone thinks this reads more like ectopic vs. blighted ovum and whether you think there’s any other proactive steps I can take. 

Last period (LMP) was 4/6/25. 
Likely ovulated (I track BBT) on 4/18/25. 
First VVFL was on 11 DPO, 4/29/25. 

Kept testing to watch line progression and this is where I started to get concerned - lines were baaaaarely darkening (very different from my last pregnancy that ended in MMC).

Started spotting and then truly bleeding on 15 DPO, 5/3/25. Continued for three days.  Some coffee grounds-type spotting/bleeding. 

Figured I was having an early miscarriage and grieved hard. But still testing positive. Called my OB and they ordered my first three betas. 

17 DPO, 5/5, hCG was 27 - abysmal number, given that I’d been testing positive for almost a week

20 DPO, 5/8, hCG was 62 - ok, doubling in 57 hours - do I have a shred of hope? Have only been spotting when I wiped. Started having frequent, strange left-sided pain on this day. Continue to have it occasionally after this day. 

22 DPO, 5/10, hCG was 155. At this point my OB said unless you’re in horrific pain or bleeding heavily, see ya at 9 weeks. I debated pushing them more but decided to keep monitoring in my own. Had one intense, weird pain on my left side again. 

24 DPO, 5/12, hCG was 347. Spotting more heavily again. 

I’ll get another beta today and I scheduled a private ultrasound for Saturday (5/17/25) - desperately hoping we see something.

Someone added me on facebook months ago pero hindi ko inaccept agad kasi hindi ko kilala (Hindi pumasa sa screening. Eme HAHAHA). Tas one time, I saw a familiar face sa school namin, so binalikan ko yung friend request to confirm if it was him, and parang siya nga. I accepted his friend request kahit 20+ weeks ago na 'yon. Feel ko nga nalimutan na niyang inadd niya ako HAHAHAHA. We didn't have any interaction naman. Wala, dumagdag lang kami sa story viewers ng isa't isa HAHAHAHA.

A week ago lang, I saw him ulit sa school. He was staring at me sa malayo pa lang kaya tinitigan ko rin (competitive 'yan siya HAHAHAHA). I was actually waiting na magsmile siya kaso hindi (pisti) kaya nilagpasan ko na lang din siya. I thought hindi niya rin ako nakilala kaya poker face siya the whole time. BUT right after ko makauwi, bumungad sa 'kin yung reply and react niya sa story ko. Nagreply siya ng heart sa story ko and I replied ""ikaw 'yon 'no? HAHAHAHAHA"", he confirmed naman na siya nga 'yon and nakita niya rin ako. Dry texter siya, kainis. Nakakairita kasi ang energetic ng reply ko tas sasagot nang sofer lamig. 'Wag na lang, 'wag na lang!!! HAHAHAHA EME.

He messaged me ulit day after— inaya niya ako magkape. I was like???? Parang may bayad ang per word ng reply mo kahapon tas ngayon mag-aaya ka ng kape??? Saan ba? HAHAHAHA JK. Pero seriously, hindi ako naniwala kaya tinawanan ko lang. Super hilig ko sa coffee kaya madalas ako sa coffee shops— I always post din sa story yung drink ko. PALAGI siyang nagrereply. Paulit-ulit niya pa rin ako inaya kaya naniwala na akong seryoso siyang gusto niya magkape HAHAHAHA. Hesitant ako sumama kasi dry texter nga, I fear na magtitigan lang kami sa personal. Sofer awkward. Baka gustuhin ko pang magbukod kami ng table HAHAHAHAHA.

Yesterday nang gabi, I went out para sana magdinner tas sakto na he messaged me ulit— kape raw. Pumayag na ako since hindi ko rin naman alam kung saan ako kakain and wala akong kasama. Sinundo niya ako and tangena super bango niya. Paglapit niya naamoy ko agad yung scent niyang parang kakalabas lang from shower. Act fool ako para maangas kunwari HAHAHAHA. Aangkas ako so sinuotan niya ako ng helmet kaya lalo q siya naamoy huhuhuhu help. Anw, ang daldal niya while driving, ako na yung sumusuko. Ibang-iba sa chat ang gaga. 

Nung nakakita na kami ng coffee shop, he asked agad for my order and dumiretso sa counter. I told him na babayaran ko yung akin kasi auq talaga na nililibre ako. Ayoko talaga magpalibre, magpababy pwede pa HAHAHA jk. Umupo na kami sa couch and started talking. Our conversation went well naman— random chika and basic questions sa each other.

1kmlluv,https://i.redd.it/4wv7yhw1cs0f1.jpeg,My Dad's Gone... A Message For Great Man.,"My Dad died yesterday and I'm not sure I really know how to feel.

He had been in a nursing home for almost a decade with physical (could no longer walk on his own) and mental (alzheimers/dementia) problems that became too much for me to handle alone as his caretaker (which I'd been for about seven years prior to that).  He went to sleep Monday morning and took is final breathes with my Mom at his bedside just over a day ago.  We'd known it was coming for a while as he'd taken a downturn in the last year or so, but it just...  hurts.  It hurts so much to know he's gone.

At eighty-one, he had a long, good life and I'm so grateful that he passed on without pain and before he completely lost himself or forgot who his family were.  I'm extra thankful that his final days were mostly happy.  But, at the same time, I'm just so profoundly sad at the thought that he's gone and we now have to live in a world without him.  I don't have any friends to lean on or talk to and our family isn't so good with displays of emotions and such (great people, just not outwardly able to express themselves well), but I wrote a little something for him and hope it's okay to post it here...



For My Dad...
07/05/1943 – 05/13/2025

I honestly don't know how to start this.  The day we've been dreading for years has arrive and my mind seems to be simultaneously filled with memories and devoid of thoughts.  Though, one word does seem to keep popping up in the background during these moments of quiet chaos... hero.

Hero is a word that gets bandied around a lot these days.  Almost so much that it's lost a lot of its impact and meaning.  But to me, it is so fittingly appropriate right now.  My Dad was my hero.  He was a mostly unassuming man, much preferring to stay quietly in the background rather than ever seek the spotlight for himself.  A man of silent dignity and strength, he'd never tell you if there was something wrong because making the world brighter and easier for those he loved and cared for was far more important to him than any level of personal pain.  He was a man of simple pleasures.  A slow morning tinkering with things in the garage while enjoying an endless pot of coffee or a relaxing evening in front of the television with his family were his idea of time perfectly spent.  And there is little he would not do to help or try to fix a problem someone else was having, even if it meant his own hardship.  Even as a young child, I would often marvel at his ability to simply make a friend with anyone he would happen upon.  He offered kindness and joy to anyone he met.  My Dad was, is, and will always be my hero.

Words seem so inadequate to explain how badly my heart hurts right now.  While I know time will dampen this pain and life will go on, it's hard to imagine a world without my Dad in it.  He was always such a constant.  A true bedrock of our family and though I know we will somehow move forward, it's so very difficult to fathom a life without him.  

Thank You, Dad, for being the best father a guy could ask for.  Thank You for loving us with all your heart.  Thank You for going above and beyond whenever you could to make sure we were happy.  Thank You for all the little lessons you taught us kids.  Even though it may not have seemed like we were listening, somehow, a lot of that stuff got through.  Thank You for showing your love in all those simple little ways that we were too young to appreciate at the time.  In short, Thank You for being my Dad.

I don't know that there will ever be a day that goes by in which I won't profoundly miss you.  And until we meet again, please know that I Love You more than words could ever express.

Your Son,

I know this might sound harsh. And no, I’m not one of “those” insecure girlfriends. Please—hear me out first.

(P.S. Some personal info has been changed to keep my anonymity.)

I (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been dating for a year now, and things have been going well. We met on a dating app (you know, the one with the fire logo) and casually dated for about 6 months before I said yes to being officially together. Throughout those months, he’s been nothing but kind and generous. He even introduced me to his parents and friends early on.

One thing to note: he rides a motorcycle and often goes on trips with his friends. After a while, he started inviting me to join those rides. At first, it was just the two of us, and I honestly enjoyed it. But eventually, he started bringing me along to hang out with his friends more often.

Now, I don’t have a problem with his friends. I actually have guy friends too—though not super close. I know how to bond with guys, and I’m not the jealous type. But after a few group hangouts, I started noticing something that bothered me.

HE ALWAYS PAYS!
Whenever we’d go out for a ride or grab drinks—especially with one of his closest friends—he always ends up covering the bill.

And take note: we’re both still in college. We’re not working yet. He’s just genuinely that generous. But things got weirder when that same close friend brought his brother-in-law along on a ride. A grown man—with a wife and kids. And guess what? No one paid but my boyfriend. Not even an offer to split the bill. Nothing.

Some of his friends already have jobs, and yet, even then, I can't imagine letting a fellow college student pay 2k+ for a meal for everyone. Like—what???

Then it happened again. That same friend brought his girlfriend on a coffee date with us. Keep in mind, my boyfriend and I have already fought about this multiple times. I even told him, if you ever pay for another one of their meals—even a little—I will personally confront them. In front of the girlfriend. I don’t care if it’s embarrassing.

So we went to this coffee shop, ordered food and drinks, and he asked me to go find a seat while they ordered. When they joined me, he told me he ordered nachos because “it looked good.” I was surprised—because we already ordered food and drinks. So I pressed him for the truth, and he admitted: the nachos were shared because his friend and the girlfriend didn’t order any food. And worse? His friend made the girl pay for their order!

Like—who brings a +1 and lets another guy pay for their girlfriend's food? WTF.

I was so mad, I even dropped a little passive-aggressive bomb: I mentioned to that friend about a girl he was trying to get close to—“Oh, ____! My friend was asking if we're still going to that place?” (We had planned a ride to Elyu just three days before he brought this new girl along.)

Anyway, we went home, and I was livid. I told my boyfriend that if he ever pays again, I’ll confront them and call them out to their faces. Like seriously—we’re not rich. We’re both still in school. Why does he have to act like their sugar daddy?

Now here’s the thing: his friends have been bugging him to go drinking and riding again. They’re even starting to make it look like I’m the bad guy for ""not letting"" him hang out. So I told him straight: If they want to hang out, it needs to be KKB (Kanya-Kanyang Bayad). I’m not going to sit by while they use him for free rides and free food. Since then? No hangouts. Nothing.

So now I’m asking—OA ba ako?
Because honestly, I do feel a bit guilty sometimes. But seriously, how are we supposed to build a future if money keeps going out and nothing’s coming back?",4,1747244701.0,OALangBaAko,5,1.0,False

1kmletv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmletv,$KENDU- Crypto’s next evolution!,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars. 

Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back. 
From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. 
On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in.
Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.

Fortunately not everything can always be bad! There are definitely successful memecoins out there, just take a look at a few of the giants, $Doge,$Shib or $Pepe for example.
So what made these coins successful?
They didn’t use KOL’s, didn’t use market makers, basically they didn’t do any bullshit!
They had one thing only, and that’s a community! 
Not one just there hoping for a pump to make a quick buck. A community that believed in who they were and what they stood for, Even when nobody else did!
Their choice to stay organic and use their community to build themselves to the top is what got them there and let them stay there. 

$KENDU is walking the same path the memecoins giant’s did. But we aren’t here just to walk in their footsteps, we’re here to go beyond where they did, push boundaries further than they have ever been pushed. 
And we have the community to do it!
We are filled with people working tirelessly to make $KENDU succeed. You literally won’t find a harder working community than us! 
We work so hard we get questions if we are using bots to do it! Which we don’t, i can 100% assure you every post, every comment is a real person!
Although with our massive output on the socials i  can understand the confusion :)

Our insane output on the socials, although impressive isn’t what differentiates us from the others. 
What does differentiate $KENDU from all the others is our active IRL expansion!
This is what makes $KENDU not a memecoin but a brand! 
We’re the first to do so and with that we are writing crypto history!

Just a few of the products we have so far:
- Kendu energy, Yes, you read that right, we have our own energy drinks. Included in this is also Kendu street, which produces Kendu merchandise. https://kenduenergy.com
- Kendu coffee, If energy drinks aren’t your thing Kendu coffee is the option for you!  https://kenducoffee.com
- Kendu games, Yes, there is a Kendu game in the works, powered by a AAA developer! Isn’t that amazing? x.comhttps://x.comKendu Games (@KenduGames) / X
- Kendu created, which allows you free acces to blueprint’s to create your own Kendu mask! https://kenducreator.com

These are just a few of the many projects the $KENDU community is working on! 
The creativity and raw dedication of this community is unmatched!

If that wasn’t enough to convince you here are some $Kendu stats:
- We are the second memecoin to reach 50k votes needed for a free Certik audit. (First was $PEPE) Talk about a community!
- Certik rates our community 98/100👀. Other larger memecoins are in the 70’s 
- We currently have 18k holders which is insane for our size. Previous ATH happened with 3.5k, Talk about distribution!
- Our top 100 wallets only hold 48% of the supply. This includes LP addresses which ofcourse naturally inflate this number! Pretty crazy for our size! (This is better than coins close to 1B MC.
- We’re active on 3 chains, ETH, SOL and Base. 
- We recently cleanly broke out of a year long downtrend. This allowed Kendu to build the strongest foundation of any current memecoin. The only was is up now!

$KENDU isn’t just a memecoin like all the others. We’re redefining what a memecoin could and should be, which funnily enough isn’t even a memecoin, it’s a brand!
We’re writing history! We are the next evolution!

Check out our Website (https://www.kendu.io), our subreddit (r/KenduInu_Ecosystem), and especially our Telegram! ( Link can be found on our website).
Lurk around for a bit with us, see what we’re all about, feel what true community feels like!
At Kendu we encourage a work culture but we aren’t forcing anyone to do anything! You should be inspired to work, not forced! You’re welcome to just chill if you’d like, although any amount of work is appreciated, even just a like or an upvote!
We’d be happy to have you join the pack!

We don’t gamble, we work! $KENDU.

If you guys think I'm crazy feel free to comment saying so - I just need to hear it from someone other than my friends (who I feel like are required to tell me I look fine) and my doctors (who don't think I need to lose any weight because I am a healthy weight at the end of the day). 

  
I am 23F, 5'9"", and currently 144lbs. Growing up I was very athletic and therefore never had to worry about what I ate. I hovered around 145 for most of my life until I got to college, but I had a very athletic build and was not insecure about where I held my weight. My second year of college I stopped being able to swallow food and ended up losing a lot of weight that I hadn't planned on because of it. It was definitely a mental block, but I was unable to force myself to eat and ended up dropping all the way down to 125lbs. Because I was eating so little, my stomach metaphorically ""shrunk"", and even after I was able to eat normally again my appetite was way smaller than it had been and I was consistently eating less food.

  
Over the next two years I got back to healthy eating habits, but because I had lost so much weight I wasn't really concerned about what I was eating because I knew I had some weight to gain back. The problem now is that I can't stop gaining weight. Ideally, I would like to be 135, but I am finding it actually impossible to lose weight no matter what I do - in fact I keep GAINING weight. At the start of my ""weight loss journey"" I was 139 hoping to get down to 130, but I realized over time that I was only continuing to gain weight and that it was going to be impossible for me to get there, so I changed my goal to 135. 

I own a fitness watch and meticulously track what I eat. A normal day of eating for me looks like: a protein coffee (110), a banana (105), soup (130), an apple (110), strawberries and grapes (100), carrots (30), 1 cup brown rice (210), broccoli (100), 4oz chicken + 1tbsp oil (250), yogurt (60), and a rice cake (60) for a total of 1265 calories a day. I also get at LEAST 10,000 steps every single day, as well as doing an ab/ Pilates workout for 10-30 minutes. 

Based on everything that I know and have read, I should be losing weight, but I haven't lost a single pound - I've gained 5. I am aware that I am already relatively thin/ a healthy weight, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to lose a few more pounds to get back to how I looked a few years ago. I would love to hear people's thoughts on what they think I might be doing wrong or what I could change to just lose these 10 pounds.",0,1747244114.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.5,False

I have been in Argentina for 3 weeks now almost fully immersing in the language. Most of my time has been spent hanging out with locals and the ones I've spent time with have been happy to help me with Spanish.

Anyway this is just my experience as a beginner, this isn't advice or anything as I know I'm still new (especially after being humbled here lol).

BAD

- listening comprehension is probably the hardest part of a language, by fucking far. Even after 3 weeks of immersion I still struggle to understand basic conversations and have to ask people to repeat or slow down or sometimes have to pull out google translate which always sucks

- after a certain point, i started to try to ""think"" in spanish. every time I had a thought (in English), i would try to have that same thought in Spanish, and I realized that I couldn't conceptualize 95% of the thoughts in my head into spanish yet, which humbled me alot

- some days I can't even order a fucking coffee in spanish, there are definitely ups and downs, and one bad fumbly conversation can hurt your confidence alot in the language for the next several hours

GOOD

- speaking is a lot easier than I thought it would be. Once you get over the initial anxiety and awkwardness, it becomes easier. Since I have a foundation of vocabulary, even if I can't fully express myself like I can in english, I found I can just caveman it to get my point across, and my sentences are getting more comprehensible and ""correct"" each day

- I find myself learning and using new words every day without ever actively looking those words up or coming across them in my ""flashcards"", which is awesome; literally learning spanish words the same way I learned words in english as a kid

- I have been progressing A LOT in just 3 weeks, mostly thanks to the people I have been spending time with who are happy to teach me and patient with my low level of their language

- most Latin Americans love it when foreigners learn their language which is encouraging. This is what originally made me give up on multiple other languages at different points in my life, like Germans who just immediately switch to english or French who for some reason actively get offended when you try to talk in French (no hate to my german or french friends but this is a real thing lol)",2,1747244005.0,Spanish,0,1.0,False

I was overprepared, being likely over organized with prep for items I needed, but that made things super easy to set up. Somehow I was able to fit all my stuff in my 2 door Jeep JL 🤣.

I am 2 markets in now. Luckily my familiarity with sales let me be comfortable asking people to come try samples that I had brewed up, which helped entice people over; even though the marketing of the product was enough to bring many people over.

I was extremely pleased with the general feedback from everyone who tried my blends. A lot of surprise on how smooth and flavorful it was. To be expected, though... most people have not had coffee this freshly roasted. People are also quick to pick up on your passion, and I think that helped people be comfortable trying and buying.

Sales wise, it was about what Chat GPT told me to expect, which is crazy LOL.

I dont think I could have expected a better first two weeks, because even those who did not buy were at least trying and giving feedback. I was also surprised to see how many people prefer a bolder, darker brew.... luckily I have one that is darker than I normally would drink (blends is based on a friends palate).

Id love to answer any questions for those considering doing markets in the future. There's only so much I can think of and fit in now while waiting for these damn tacos lol",8,1747243985.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

It happened gradually over 3 1/2 years that I've been in a stressful apartment. I found this site and youtube ""Shapefixer"" in which a guy of around 50 was scheduled for a hip replacement.  He explains that it's our food choices, times that we eat, stress and lack of sleep that causes our immune system to attack the cartelidge that pads our joints.  With enough sleep, intermittent fasting and certain food choices, and strategic exercise, we can actually rebuild the cartelidge.  We have to be strategic about it though.  It takes about 3 months to rebuild the cartelidge.  You can either pay like $100 for the deep dive or just get info from his YouTube channel and free website.  I've actually heard this from other sources too that as long as you have cells on the ends of your bones that build the cartelidge and have not worn them off with YEARS of not fixing the problem, they WILL build cartelidge cells and rebuild the pads in your hip, knee etc.  You would have to go very, very far to actually grind down those cells and not be able to rebuild the cartilage.   He has Xrays that show his cartilage actually regrew.  I actually believe this because I had a lot of problems in my lower back L5/S1 joint and I also have before/after cartelidge regrowth photos from where I took time off to rest and take care of myself, and it was no longer ""bone on bone"" after like 2 years.  My Chiro took the X rays and I have them on my Instagram.  I'm pretty sure that living in an apartment building with no elevator and having to walk up stairs every day, carry everything up the stairs every day, AND walk up and down a steep hill to get to my car exacerbated the problem that was already happening and that together with the stress of the older cranky neighbors in here, caused a thinning of the cartilage in my hip and knee, also the fact that there are some amazing pastry and coffee shops in this neighborhood that I keep eating from.  This apartment and neighborhood were basically an OA trap.   But I have fixes for all of this stuff - neighbors are getting blocked out with Quiet Wall this summer on the thin wall in here,  no more coffee and pastry binges, intermittent fasting which I needed anyway, and easing up on some of the hard exercises i was doing and bringing in the cartelige regrowth exercises.

I've still had the occasional <5mg THC gummy, and even the desire to snack just isn't that powerful that I can't overcome. 

Lastly, I went to the doctor earlier this week and I had perfect 120/80 BP.  I'm never usually really high, but that was a welcome surprise.

I am hoping to find someone who was in the same position as me, or someone who could point out what exactly I’m doing wrong.

I’m female, 22, 168 cms tall, and I weigh roughly 68 kg (my weight tends to fluctuate between 68-68.5).
I do pilates once a week, and I’ve been doing weight lifting for over three years (and I usually manage to do it 3 times a week). 

My absolute dream would be to lose 8 kgs, but at the moment I am aiming to lose 3, so I can get to 65 kgs. 

I have been trying to lose weight pretty much my entire life. I’ve lost and gained the same 4 kgs countless times, but my weight ALWAYS plateaus at 68 kg. 

I’ve worked with a personal trainer, got to 68 kgs. Currently working with a dietician, and it’s already been two months, and my weight simply WON’T BUDGE. I have changed essentially every single thing I could to make my eating as healthy as possible, for example:
1. I don’t eat simple carbs in my meals anymore- things like white bread, pasta, couscous, etc. I only eat complex carbs, such as quinoa (and I don’t mind it. I find quinoa deliciosu).
2. My snacks are heatlhy. Usually fruit that are low on the glycemic index, nuts, protein yogurt, sometimes homemade date balls. 
3. I don’t drink my calories EVER. I used to have a soy milk coffee in the mornings, and I don’t anymore. 
4. I eat tons of vegetables. Not as much as I would like but I have IBS and having too much causes GI issues for me.

YES, I HAVE BEEN COUNTING CALORIES. I have lost 4 kgs last summer by counting calories, but now, the deficit is simply not working, and going any lower for me would leave me hungry and fatigued. I eat at a deficit of 1400, on “bad” days it could be 1500-1600, but I’m very diligent about counting every single drop that goes into my mouth. And yes, I have a scale. And yes, I count sauces, oils, etc. 

I genuinely have no idea what I’m doing wrong. I have a fair amount of muscle, but I’m not sure if I’m gaining any more bc my measurements are the same as always and my weight is not budging.

His name Virgil, and he had been a longtime lookout on this District, for a tower about twenty miles from my assigned perch. 

Virgil was in his seventies and was a large man, probably six foot three and at least two hundred and fifty pounds. With his oversized and faded red and black check jacket, he filled the doorframe, giving me no other option but to sit and hear what he had to say. Not that I didn’t want to, I was a new lookout and excited as anybody, having spent the winter scouring old stories and browsing forums like this one for any tips, tricks, or tools of the trade.

“What tower will you be working?” he asked. 

I told him.

“Oh! Yeah!” he replies, and then dives into the particularities of how to work and live in that tower. From the cold northerly winds that had a tendency to blow out the heater’s pilot light, the elk that will go for a swim on a hot summer’s day in the pond eight hundred feet below, to the exact log in the woodpile where black widows make home, Virgil goes on at length as to the intricacies of fire lookout life. 

On the one hand, I was impressed–here stood a man with a real mind for this sort of work, a man who had devoted himself to a single field, and excelled at it. Virgil had found his niche. On the other hand, I was getting a little annoyed. These are things I would soon find out for myself, actually, would *prefer* to find out for myself. I didn’t care for having the entirety of my upcoming season spoiled in a twenty minute verbal dump. There would be time enough up there for things to unravel at their own pace.

Then he delves into the procedures for solving very particular problems, such as a what to do if a chipmunk barricades itself behind the stove. I don’t quite recall what his procedure was, but it involved taking a couple of mattresses and forming them into a V, then driving my guest out the door. He goes into protocol after protocol for a slew of specific scenarios–how to deter flying ant swarms, how to re-wire a chainlink fence, the *correct* order to clean the cabin, the *proper* way to organize the propane fridge, the *right* foods to pack out. After each instruction, he emphasizes either, “You’ve gotta *know these things*!”, or, “A lookout has to be *able to do these things*!”

This was my first day both on this Forest and in this U.S. State, so I remained polite. But I was getting peeved with him; Virgil had quickly descended from a helpful veteran lookout offering some useful advice, to a person who saw only one way to do anything and everything–His Way. And he was going to be damned if some rookie was going to step out of line on his old forest. I thought to myself, I am a grown adult who is more than capable of figuring these things out on his own, and frankly, not one his many training scenarios required much more than a moment of thought and a speck of sense. 

Eventually he departed the office, and I went out to my tower for the summer. I learned how to do many things, such as keeping the pilot light on the heater lit on windy days, spotting the elk in the pond eight hundred feet below, and where the black widows liked to set up shop. In late September, as the snows began falling on the northern Rockies, I closed up the tower and contentedly notched a season as a fire lookout.



The following spring, working a new lookout on a new Forest and in a new U.S. State, I awoke early on my second morning to the sound of scurrying claws across a tile floor. Bigger than a mouse. Bracing myself for a possible packrat infestation, I opened my bedroom door and heard whatever it was bolt for some dark recess in my cabin I did not yet know about. Deciding that it could remain there for a moment, I went into the kitchen and began brewing some coffee I could strategize over.

As the kettle began to whistle, a high-pitched sharp chirping sound uttered from behind the stove. A chipmunk. A damn chipmunk has barricaded itself behind the stove. I remember Virgil, and I remember his lecture from the year before. In this moment, I was equally exasperated by my infiltrator, and by Virgil’s ultimate prescience. I also realized that his Proper Way wasn’t going to work–the kitchen was too cramped for me to carry a coil spring mattress into there, let alone two somehow formed into a funnel.

With a moment of thought and a speck of sense, I constructed a Great Wall of Furniture and Household Objects leading from the stove to the propped open back door, keeping an eye on the trembling tail of the chipmunk protruding from under the stove to be sure it did not duck my defensive line before completion. 

Coffee securely out of the way, I prepare to sling the stove and bring the broom to bear, chasing the chipmunk I now named Virgil out the door. But he preempts me, pouring through the gap between stove and cabinet. A fluffy flash of copper and white striping as Virgil makes his big move, clattering over the tile and chittering angrily at this rude treatment. Fortunately, the Great Wall performed as intended, and I regain the upper hand driving the broom just behind him and shouting “Go Virgil! Go!” He pauses before a small weakness in the fortification, a gap between the overturned table and water jug which would lead out into the living room, but I keep the pressure on and he takes the leap out the door and under my woodpile.

I slam the screen door shut. Cool and collected, I right all of the furniture, return the stove to it’s position, and reach for my coffee. Looking at the clock, I still have plenty of time before the morning check call. Matter of fact, I resolved that whole situation in only a few minutes–my coffee is still hot. After all, a lookout knows how to do these things. ",1,1747243589.0,firelookouts,3,0.67,False

Note I suggest this as an observation, an idea -- more as a topic for discussion than any kind of scientific fact.  

On the side of the rules we have things like:

* ""There are no musts in AA -- but there are a few damned-well-better-be's.""  (Heard in Indiana AA).
* Everything is a suggestion in AA.  But if you jump out of an airplane with a parachute, we suggest you pull the ripcord.
* Without the steps I was a dry drunk.
* ""B) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcholism.""
* Keep your discussion focused on alcoholism.
* Share the message, not the mess.
* Sit down, shut up, and listen.
* Your best thinking got you here.
* Are you willing to go to any lengths? (Used to qualify sponsees who'll take your abuse).
* Etc., etc.

On the side of love, or of friendship we have things like:

* The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
* Welcome, you're in the right place, have a coffee, etc.
* Don't judge your sobriety by how you feel.  Your feelings will get better in time. Bring the body and the mind will follow.
* If you didn't pick up a drink today, you're successful.
* The group usually goes out for coffee after the meeting if you're interested.
* ""I think my phone is broken.  Why don't you call me to help me test it out?"" (Heard in my first year).
* Do you want to help us (set up chairs, make coffee, whatever it is).
* Hugs.  (Creepy ones don't count).

I usually try to stay on the friendly side since it was largely what fixed me early on, but there's a certain level of alcholic denial and nuttiness that will sometimes turn me into psycho rule boy.",3,1747243490.0,AASecular,0,1.0,False

@aquila bleated: Today my arm is no longer numb after a good night's rest. 

Today I woke up with no desire to go to my ""job"", which makes me go to the electrician course so far away for a measly 600 reais (100 dollars) per month, yes, my payment is received on the last day of the month and only that little. 

After thinking that if I don't go, 30 reais (5 dollars) will be deducted from my salary, I went down to get out of bed, do my morning hygiene and go eat something. Today I was a little sleepy so I had a cup of coffee. I hadn't had one for a few weeks due to the effects of drinking coffee such as the urge to go to the bathroom, but apart from that I poured myself a cup and drank it. 

Today I saw my mother briefly in the morning, she was wearing gym clothes, which were something like a black elastic outfit with the legs, arms and chest separated, she had explained to me that this type of clothing helps the trainer to see the muscles instead of having to touch us through our fur.  

Last night my mother had to cut some of the wool from my head yesterday, what you humans usually call hair (and us too by custom) because the human who cut my wool left a place where there was much more than there should have been, and my mother cut it for me. 

She has worked as a hairdresser for humans and venlil so she knows how to do it, since when we had no money she would cut my hair herself. 

Back to today, she gave me a brief good morning and see you later and left for her routine while I finished preparing for mine, where our teacher (who we don't like whether he's a male or female student even though he has an ok personality) will possibly put us to a surprise test at some point this week, maybe today or Friday.  

The material he is teaching is not difficult in itself but for some reason it is strangely difficult to learn how to do it correctly. 

One thing I heard both Maria and Luan saying on the train home that we took together is that the teacher has a strange look with bad intentions, his look is uncomfortable, it's as if he wanted to commit a crime with one of the girls in the class, even more so being a strange old human.
 
I have nothing against him but it's something that all the girls in the room unanimously agreed on in a conversation, besides always paying more attention to the girls, I hope nothing bad happens.  

I'm getting lost, after having coffee I put on my lab coat, backpack, and after filling my water bottle and getting something to eat I went to the garage where my grandfather was waiting, he has lived in the land since he was born and my grandmother came to live here with him after they got married. 

Today he jokingly said that his morning walk was forgotten due to sleeping too much due to it being cold and being cozy, so we talked a little and said that on the weekend it will be warmer, and he joked that it will be good to go to the beach. 

After being taken to the station, my routine of catching the train and standing most of the way begins. 

After arriving at the train change station, I saw Maria, and tried to communicate: 

Aquila: "" good morning maria""

Maria: "". . .""

I was met with cold silence, well at least I know I still have to keep my promise to try to be better, that's why I wear a ring. 

After waiting 20 minutes, Renan also arrived and the three of us, together but separately, went to our common destination for today. 

After sitting for a while, I decided to talk to Renan about something that involved our work:

Aquila: ""Hey Renan, yesterday I was watching a video that reminded me of our work "".

Renan: ""what was it ?""

Aquila: ""Remember that time we went to the school workshop and practiced with a fake pole how to reconnect his switches?"" 

Renan: ""I remember yes ""

Aquila: ""Yesterday I saw a video of a guy doing this but he wasn't trained. ""

Renan: **noise of concern ** ""It went to shit, right? ""

Aquila: ""Yes, he went to turn on the switch and the transformer exploded along with the entire pole and half of the guy who messed up."" 

Renan: ""how dangerous, right? That's why we need to train more."" 

We were silent for a moment to think about what to say next. 

Aquila: ""What do you think of the new material the teacher has been teaching?"" 

Renan: ""I have found it tiring, the teacher goes through a lot of things very quickly but other than that it is not difficult."" 

Aquila: ""I agree, the subject is not difficult, it is actually simple, but I still make silly mistakes."" 

After this little conversation we remained in silence until we arrived at the station where we had to get off to get to our school. 

After a short practical class on circuits, electrical and magnetic currents, we went to the break where the most inelegant thing in the world happened. 

A classmate named Akira asked if there were cases of incest in my family, which made me angry and I said, controlling myself:  

Aquila: ""No Akira, I don't, I'm naturally ugly like this, don't worry"" 

Akira: ""That's not what I meant-"" **I interrupt her **

Aquila: ""Don't say anything else, I don't want to hear you"" 

Jean and Maria were close by, Jean laughed at her comment but defended me and Maria just watched in silence, after that we got into a conversation about genetics, whether it would be possible through the artificial selection of intelligent dogs or those with an intellect greater than crows, and yes, in short, we agreed that it is possible.  

After that we went to another practical class which was boring. 

As much as Jean is shy, he tries to compensate for this by being the opposite of extroverted. I am reclusive but not shy, perhaps I am the opposite of him. 

Even though racial prejudice has decreased, it still exists... this irritates and disappoints me deeply.  

After class we went to catch the train back and I was alone with Maria... should I try to talk to her? Maybe it's not possible anymore... I won't try anymore...  

I'm tired of going after people who don't try to do the same for me... I give up on her.

1kmkw4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1kmkw4t/review_flare_calmer_mini_ear_plugs/,REVIEW - Flare Calmer (mini) ear plugs,"When I first put these in I thought “this is weird what on earth are these going to do? I can barely feel them and there’s certainly no dampening noise at all and I still hear the fan…” But I wore them all day and…

I’m sold. I’m so sold that I am now after one day terrified I’m going to lose them and I’m ordering a back up pair. 

Yes, you barely notice them. In fact the entire day I was thinking “these aren’t doing anything” and I several times had to check they were still in my ears. However, I then took stock of what kind of day I was actually having because I felt pretty calm and if I looked at my day objectively normally I would not have been calm. 

Here is my detailed account of my day and the effects that these had on me:

**A bit confused but not disregulated by plan change**
The day started with a change of plan where I had agreed with my partner to do one outdoor activity in the morning and he changed it on me last minute. That happens a lot and what usually happens I think is a small form of dissociation where I kind of turn into a follower and just let him guide us but yesterday I was just kind of like “oh OK” and then I was fully participating.

**Totally calm driving through construction**
Normally I get a little bit agro with stop and go traffic and especially if my partner is in the car because he gets anxious of my driving. I have a PDA profile so him making any comment about my driving throws me into a horrible spiral which means that when we are driving together I’m usually quite tense and on alert for his emotions and very focussed on driving a specific way to not trigger his anxiety. But yesterday I was totally fine, just calm.

**Didn’t lose it when a dentist appt was cancelled because they gave us the wrong time and we showed up late**
My partner had a dental appt which he had to take Ativan for. It was their fault. We missed a pretty epic adventure trip with friends for this appointment. My partner was really upset. Later in the car talking I wasn’t affected by him being upset the way I normally am. I also stayed calm and even friendly with the dentist. Also this threw my plans off because I was planning to do Costco while he was there and yet still I was in control and ok with the changes. 

**Had to go to Costco…’nuff said**
I was totally fine in Costco. Normally when shopping I go through several moments of wanting to punch people in the face. Usually it’s older (not truly old, they can be as slow as they want, I forgive them) but rather people like 65ish just blissfully unaware of their impact on every human around them. Yesterday? Not even once. 

**Costco with medicated partner didn’t throw me off either** 
AND I was in Costco with my heavily sedated partner who made the trip take twice as long and I had to keep looking for him. I also had to make sure to speak gently to him because his world was so slow that any energy at all was throwing him off. But I wasn’t sped up or frantic or in a hurry or anything. I was totally fine. In fact I wasn’t annoyed by him at all. It was weird. Normally I would find the situation amusing and have fun with it but also have this low level anxiety and annoyance. 

**The coffee grinder!!!!!”
So this is the final thing that convinced me. Or rather I guess we could say the final thing that made me realize the kind of day that I had yesterday. So one of the first things I did yesterday with the ear plugs in was made coffee and I noticed that the coffee grinder wasn’t as annoying. Normally if my partner is home I ask him to grind the coffee for me but if he’s not home I can do it, it’s OK, I just don’t like it. It hurts my ears in a way that I can’t explain. Yesterday I noticed that it didn’t do that. But I thought that not being bothered grinding coffee was only a minor difference. I wasn’t really sure since it was basically the first thing I did in the day with the ear plugs and I remember thinking “ok I can hear a bit of a difference but if this is all they do, this isn’t worth the inconvenience of wearing them”. So now this morning is the next day and I did not put the ear plugs in because all I’ve done this morning is get up and take my dog for a walk and make breakfast. HOWEVER…I just went to grind coffee and I lasted about two seconds before I ran for the earplugs. I then put them in and ground the coffee and the difference was so incredible that I stopped part way through and sat down on the couch with my phone to write this post. 

I can’t put my finger on it but with the earplugs in the coffee grinder is just another loud noise without the earplugs the coffee grinder is the same volume but it not only hurts my ears it does something to the whole entire inside of my body and now that I have the experience of grinding coffee without that feeling happening. **The difference is so incredible I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to grind coffee without the earplugs now without being totally aware of how torturous it is.**

Some of this is the fact that I am high masking so I’m just starting to get in touch with my sensory issues (I also have a sensory processing disorder). I knew that I preferred not to grind the coffee but I thought that it was just boring or maybe I physically didn’t like holding the grinder and now I realize it’s because of the effect of the noise.",7,1747243194.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

My friends wanted a mini vacation and wanted to drive  down to see me and/or see the new area where I lived. I told them that I was not able to host maybe we could meet in the neighboring tourist town and split accomodations. My friend has a history of being cheap, and or has a history of offloading their costs or share of expenses onto their friends.  Further, my friend almost refuses to drive and I am usually the designated driver. 

Once in town, they suggested that we go to a bar that was owned by a celebrity. I forwarded them the website and said the cocktails looked interesting (there was also a price next to the cocktails). 

They said let's go and we went. The place was high end.The drinks were expensive. We were having a nice time. 
I walked up to bar ordered myself one drink.  bartender asked for my card for tab and I said sure. Thinking I may get myself another drink.I go sit down. My friends walk up order drinks. Friend A orders a couple of expensive $17 cocktails , my other friend orders multiple expensive drinks, they tell the bartender to put it on my tab (without me knowing or me offering). I ended up ordering just one drink. They order mutliple drinks. I go to close out tab, my bill is  over $100. The bartender told me my friends told me to put it on my tab. I tell bartender this must have been a mistake. He tells me that my friends asked to put their drinks on my tab.  He reverses charges and tells me that my friends need to close out order separately. 

I go sit down, I see my friends and then I say, hi, I closed out my tab. My cheap friend goes, ""thanks for the drinks, I will get you next time (she never does)."" I politely look at her and tell her that the bartender only billed me for my drinks and they needed to close out their bill separately. 

During this trip I bought my friends breakfast, uber rides, and dessert. My friends did not cover small things not even coffee for us. I also drove them around. 

AITA for not paying for my friends expensive drinks after they came to visit and/or drove 6 hours to see me?

My cheap friend has an upcoming birthday and I am still a little upset about the situation and I don't even want to go to her birthday because I feel like costs for drinks, Ubers, and dinners will be offloaded on me. I don't like the entitlement and my friend never reciprocates and I can't think of a time where she bought me dinner or drinks. I don't make a lot of money and my cheap friend makes more than me.

This is a policy that my work is trying to implement and I am so mad about it. For context I work in an office setting and we have a communal break room. (Which I do not use as I live close enough to go home for lunch every day) 

Today we got a message in our office wide group chat stating that because people haven’t not been cleaning up after themselves everyone in the office will be expected to sign up for a day to clean the break room. This might include dishes, coffee, wiping down tables and cleaning up trash. 
I asked my manager if I could be exempt from this as I do not use the break room and have never left a mess in there. She said “no. Everyone gets a day.” So I’m more than a little peeved. To me it does not seem fair to punish me and the others who don’t use the break room for the actions of others who do and don’t clean up their own messes by making us clean up after them.

The fit was okay, but not very comfortable—my Galaxy Buds Plus and Soundcore A20i were noticeably more comfortable.

Now I'm considering whether to get the Galaxy Buds FE instead. I use a Samsung device, so I’d benefit from the tighter integration. As for ANC, I already have a headset that I wear during travel, so I'm covered there. If the ANC on the Buds FE is good enough to handle a coffee shop while listening to music, that’s more than enough for me.

In terms of water resistance, I mostly go to the gym, run occasionally, and steam up the shower before entering. Apart from that, I don’t really need any rugged protection.

So, considering all that—should I reorder a working pair of Liberty 4 NC, or go for the Galaxy Buds FE instead? Thanks! Also the sound on the 4 NC was really good after i tweaked it so how does the FE compare there? And i'm leaving next week so no time to order test drive return and keep better option.


---

TL;DR:
Returning faulty Liberty 4 NC. Galaxy Buds Plus and A20i were more comfortable. I have a Samsung phone and only need ANC for coffee shops (not flights). Also need enough water/steam resistance for gym use and steamed-up showers. Should I go with Buds FE or reorder the Liberty 4 NC?

I have been in Argentina for 3 weeks now almost fully immersing in the language. Most of my time has been spent hanging out with locals and the ones I've spent time with have been happy to help me with Spanish.

Anyway this is just my experience as a beginner, this isn't advice or anything as I know I'm still new (especially after being humbled here lol). 

BAD

- listening comprehension is probably the hardest part of a language, by fucking far. Even after 3 weeks I still struggle to understand basic conversations and have to ask people to repeat or slow down or sometimes have to pull out google translate which always sucks

- after a certain point, i started to try to ""think"" in spanish. every time I had a thought (in English), i would try to have that same thought in Spanish, and I realized that I couldn't conceptualize 95% of the thoughts in my head into spanish yet, which humbled me alot

- some days I can't even order a fucking coffee in spanish, there are definitely ups and downs, and one bad fumbly conversation can hurt your confidence alot in the language for the next several hours

GOOD

- speaking is a lot easier than I thought it would be. Once you get over the initial anxiety and awkwardness, it becomes easier. Since I have a foundation of vocabulary, even if I can't fully express myself like I can in english, I found I can just caveman it to get my point across, and my sentences are getting more comprehensible and ""correct"" each day

- I find myself learning and using new words every day without ever actively looking those words up or coming across them in my ""flashcards"", which is awesome; literally learning spanish words the same way I learned words in english as a kid

- I have been progressing A LOT in just 3 weeks, mostly thanks to the people I have been spending time with who are happy to teach me and patient with my low level of their language

- most Latin Americans love it when foreigners learn their language which is encouraging. This is what originally made me give up on multiple other languages at different points in my life, like Germans who just immediately switch to english or French who for some reason actively get offended when you try to talk in French (no hate to my german or french friends but this is a real thing lol)",3,1747242465.0,languagelearning,0,1.0,False
1kmkkbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1kmkkbh/complete_abandon_group/,COMPLETE ABANDON GROUP,"I was a member of Complete Abandon for about six months. Let’s start from the beginning.

I decided to start going to AA after a recent relapse. It was something I hadn’t tried before outside of rehab. I began attending meetings close to home, such as the one at 8111 and a few others nearby. About a month in, I was at a meeting at 8111 when, at the end, a gentleman approached me and my friend. He asked how long I’d been sober and if I had a sponsor. I told him how long I’d been sober and that I didn’t have a sponsor. He gave me his phone number and told me to call him the next day.

I did call him, and he invited me to a meeting at his home group. He mentioned it was a business meeting and told me to arrive at 6 p.m. So, the next day, I went. When I walked in, the tables were full, and there were papers at each seat with the group’s monthly financials. I was confused—what did this have to do with AA?

I sat and listened. People went through each item on the financial report: coffee, books, and so on. Each person assigned to a specific expense gave a brief summary of the month. Then, others would raise their hands to ask questions or voice concerns, often in a sarcastic, derogatory, or even insulting tone. After some back and forth, they would vote, and those in agreement would say “aye.” This went on for about an hour.

Afterward, everyone funneled outside into the parking lot and started talking in pairs. I found the man who invited me, and he asked what I thought of the meeting. I told him I wasn’t sure what was going on or how it related to recovery. He explained that this was their monthly business meeting and that he wanted me to see it for some reason.

We talked for a bit more, and he introduced me to a few people. Then I asked him when the actual meeting would start since the business portion had already taken an hour. He said the meeting started at 8 p.m. I was surprised and asked, “Oh, it doesn’t start at 7?” He said no, and then encouraged me to talk to people one-on-one. I didn’t really want to, and it felt awkward. Most people I tried to talk to said they couldn’t talk right now, so I stood around until I struck up a short conversation with another newcomer. Eventually, I was told I shouldn’t be talking to anyone with less than a year sober. I was confused but said okay and waited for the meeting.

At 8 p.m., the meeting finally began. It was a fairly normal meeting, except for a few strange moments—people made jokes about someone in the group, calling them nicknames or shouting insults. The meeting ended at 9 p.m., and I went to speak with the man who brought me. He asked how it was, and I said it was fine. He talked with me a little more, then told me to talk to more people one-on-one. By this time, I was exhausted. I’d already been there for three hours and wanted to go home. I told him that, but he insisted that this is how they do things here.

At the time, I was willing to give it a try, so I stayed, begrudgingly. I tried to talk to people, but most attempts fell flat. At 10 p.m., I went back to him, and he said, “All right, I’ll see you back here tomorrow at seven.”

From there, I began showing up every day at 7 p.m. In the beginning, I was sometimes five to ten minutes late, and I was told this was unacceptable. They said alcoholics couldn’t miss commitments. That upset me. I wasn’t a child and didn’t need to be berated by another man who wasn’t my employer or superior.

I kept attending every day from 7 to 10 p.m., and the longer I was there, the stranger things got. If you were caught standing around not in a one-on-one, you were told to get into one. If you didn’t, insults were hurled at you. People would yell things like, “What are you doing? You’re not gonna get sober like that!” You were told to “bust your ass.”

When I did manage to talk one-on-one with people, that’s when I started to see the real insanity. Many of these people were completely indoctrinated. They believed they were the worst of the worst—worthless, unredeemable scum—and that maybe, just maybe, if they followed the group’s rules every day, they might stay sober.

Another strange part was how many of them lived together. I was told I should be living with them too, which made no sense because I had a house, a car, and a full-time corporate job. I didn’t need to rent someone’s couch. They would also go downtown and try to recruit people—often homeless individuals who didn’t necessarily have drug problems, but clearly needed professional help. They’d pick these people up and bring them to the group because they were desperate for sponsees. If you didn’t have one, you’d be criticized constantly. Most of the people they brought in would disappear within a week.

You were constantly told the most important thing was to help other alcoholics, which I agree with to an extent. But the demands were extreme—like spending your entire weekend driving sponsees around to meetings all day. If you refused, you were told you were selfish and would never get sober.

The sponsorship system was another mess. Even if you had just 15 days sober, you were told to go get a “pigeon” (what they called sponsees). It didn’t matter that these people were in no condition to give advice. The group would go to meetings all over town just to find pigeons. If those pigeons didn’t have housing, they’d be placed on someone’s floor and given strict rules—wake up at 6 a.m., take the bus, go to meetings all day, every day.

At night, people were told to ask others for MARTA money. When they were turned down, their sponsors would say they weren’t trying hard enough. If they showed any frustration or disagreement, they were berated and told they were worthless and would never get sober.

As for me, I was told I had to call my sponsor every day. These calls usually lasted one to three minutes. I also had to attend meetings every night from 7 to 10 p.m., no exceptions. A couple of times, I asked if I could go to an earlier meeting so I could spend time with family, but I was told I was “too early in the program” and that I had to be there.

Most nights were spent trying to get one-on-ones. I would approach many people each night, and most of them said they were too busy. If I stood around, I’d be yelled at. When I explained that people weren’t available, it wasn’t acceptable. I was told I needed to try harder, like my life depended on it.

When I did get a one-on-one, it was usually awkward. I’d start with, “Hey, how’s it going?” and often got responses like, “I’m fine,” “You don’t really care,” or just a blank stare. I’d ask questions, and the conversation would usually devolve into them telling me I was the biggest piece of shit alive, that everything about me was wrong and flawed from birth, and that the only way to get better was to completely submit.

I work full-time as an engineer. I have a home, a nice car, and a Wife . But none of that mattered. Everything I did was wrong unless it was exactly what they told me to do.

One time, my sponsor told me to ask people about the first step. Everyone gave the same answer: I didn’t understand it, and I never would until I gave up total control of my life to my sponsor. Then—and only then—might my sponsor be able to sense that I had taken the first step. I met people who had been sober for four years who said they hadn’t taken the first step because their sponsor hadn’t seen it in them. That’s absurd.

People with more time in the program had huge egos. They talked down to you constantly. If you spoke up to someone with more time, you’d be ripped apart. Yet they always preached humility, selflessness, and helping newcomers. It was pure hypocrisy.

This group is made up of indoctrinated, brainwashed, delusional egomaniacs. For them, this group has become their new addiction, and their drug of choice is power over others. This place is toxic. It is not a place to get sober unless every other option is exhausted. And even then, you’re better off reading the Big Book by yourself and surrounding yourself with supportive friends and family.

This group doesn’t help people stay sober. It causes relapses. And when you relapse and come back, you’re told how worthless you are and how you have no chance at recovery.

I’ve been combing this subreddit for a similar situation. Perhaps I haven’t used the right keywords?

I met an older gentleman from a traditional dating app recently. My profile hints at searching for a SR. He acknowledged such, but admitted that he has never participated in the scene before. Apparently he had a date with a woman looking to be a SB for the first time. But was turned off by her desperation to get bills paid and the idea of a contract being brought up. However, he has been open to the idea.

Our meeting was supposed to be a short date over some coffee. It turned into a weekend long nature getaway with endless conversations. The chemistry is definitely bubbling and we have lots in common. We briefly discussed the arrangement over coffee and I tried my best to make sure he wasn’t feeling pressured. During the trip, I would occasionally slide in the topic and as casually as I could.

Prior to meeting me, he didn’t know much about sugaring at all. I shared with him my personal experiences and reasons for sugar dating. What I’ve gathered about different sugar dynamics and how gifts/allowances/ppm works. I don’t do it to be an escort or to have someone pay my rent. I genuinely just enjoy the lifestyle and still practice monogamy. The adventures and companionship and being taken care of. Vanilla dating, especially within my age group, has been tiring for me. 

On our last morning at the vacation home, he brought up the arrangement on his own and let me know that he was willing to do so! It took me by surprise a bit, considering that he was seemingly searching for more vanilla relationships on the app. He said that he doesn’t see why not considering his attraction to me. We’ve already begun a quite generous ppm since. It even seems as if he’s done his own research on etiquette since then! I can’t say I don’t find it a little adorable. 

This man seems genuinely sweet and perhaps even innocent in my eyes! (He profusely apologized at one point during our trip for not giving me every last detail of his personal life for a background check. Most people underestimate what I can do with a name and phone number.) Has anyone else had an experience like this? Any possible red flags to look out for?

“hey, i can’t submit it tonight. we can’t find my grandma’s urn. it’s been really hard on us.”

that’s it. no punctuation. full panic. hit send like i was diffusing a bomb.

and she believed me. SHE BELIEVED ME. said “oh no, take all the time you need.” and i did. and what did i do with that time? did i grieve fake-grandma? nah. i booted up chatgpt,used an echo writing prompt, fed it my old essays, and sat there while it literally ghostwrote my trauma essay like some digital séance.

the freaky part is it sounded like me. like if you printed out my internal monologue, spilled coffee on it, and then handed it back with teacher comments. every “kinda,” every weird side-rant—it knew.

i don’t know what’s worse: that echo writing helped me write it, or that i didn’t even feel bad when i hit submit. like i was proud of it. proud of an essay built on a lie and a missing urn that’s actually still on top of our fridge behind a cereal box.

i feel like a scammer. or a prophet. maybe both.

i just needed to put this somewhere before my brain melts from carrying this sin. grandma if you’re watching, i’m sorry. your ashes gave me 48 extra hours and an A-minus.

Probably the first coffee shop I’ve seen with an iPad register that had zero tip options. There was a tip jar though, so I think it’s because of the fees that may come with it thru the register? No clue.

I have always had extreme difficulty getting to sleep at a consistent and normal time, way before I even started ADHD meds at 17 (I have lots of memories of lying awake in bed for hours as a small child). The only difference before was being exhausted and unable to stay awake during the day but staying wide awake through the night...

My issue now is that I cannot keep a consistent schedule or make plans to do anything without throwing my body into a sleep deprived mess, only keeping myself semi-functional with coffee or Vyvanse.

I have a Lelit Bianca V3 and a DF83 V2. A couple of months ago, I replaced the stock burrs with SSP LS. I seasoned them with about a kilo of coffee, which I know wasn’t enough.

Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve noticed I have to grind finer and finer to get the same yield and shot time. For example, I used to set my grinder to 19 to get a yield of 36 grams in 25 seconds. Then I had to gradually go finer, until this morning it’s down to 10 to get the same result. For the light roast coffees I have, it's gone from 12.5 to 4. I also noticed that, aside from the shots running too fast, the pressure gauge barely goes beyond 6 bar.

To diagnose, I did the following:

1. Visually checked the coffee grounds. I can see that the grind is getting finer as I lower the settings

2. Tried a different coffee. The oldest coffee I have is 3 weeks from roast, or it’s been frozen soon after delivery and defrosted at room temp for a few days

3. Replaced the gasket on the Bianca

4. Swapped the basket from VST to IMS

5. Cleaned the grinder

6. Aligned the burrs

7. Zeroed the burrs

He was looking out the window of the train, watching as the little girl and boy got smaller and smaller. His smile diminished as their waving hands got tinier until he knew they could no longer see him. He wished they were on the train with him, but as much as he wished it, he knew it was not a good idea. The man let out a deep breath as he looked at his phone to look over the information that was sent to him.

'You are not who you think you are,' was the text that he received from an unknown number. Then, a series of text messages that contained photos came through.

One photo was a newspaper article from the day he was born. It was about an accident that occurred on a bus. Another photo was of a death certificate. The man did not recognize the name on it, but there was something about the name that nagged at him, like he should recognize it. The last picture was of him as an infant with both of his parents.

The man thought back to 3 months earlier, when he had received the text messages. He thought it was some kind of weird scam or a joke, so he showed them to his wife. 
""Hey, look at these. The first two were odd, but this last one... who would have this picture of me and my parents?""

He did not have a lot of family. There was an aunt, his mom's sister, and a grandfather on his dad's side. His mom was still living, but his dad died when he was little. His mom was not the type of person to reminisce with him and go through old photos. In actuality, none of his family were the type of people to send him old pictures. He had only a few pictures of his father or of himself from his younger years.

The more he questioned who could have sent him the picture, the more it bothered him and triggered questions.

The man was jostled out of his thoughts when an announcement was made about breakfast being served in the dining car. It was at that moment he realized that his stomach was rumbling and he should go get something to eat. He knew it would be a while until he reached his destination. He was not too concerned with his suitcase, so he just stuffed his phone and wallet into his pockets and walked to the dining car. The dining car was the next car over. The food smelled amazing to him. He ordered a traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, French toast, fruit, and coffee. 

When he finished, he thought,'This was actually as good as it smelled.' 

He headed back to grab his suitcase and check out his roommette.

When he got in the room he decided to take the bed out and take a nap. His nap was short-lived since he could not relax his mind enough to fall asleep. He just laid there with his eyes closed until he decided there was no point. He folded the bed up and went to do some window watching. 

As he sat in the seat and started to gaze out the window, his mind reverted back to the conversation he had with his mom regarding the messages he was sent. ""Mom what do you think this means?"" 

""I don't know that it means anything. Probably some kids got your number and are playing around.""

""But what about the picture? There's no way some random person would have that.""

After a long pause, she finally said, ""I don't know.""

But the next thing she did truly shocked him—she cried. It was something he hadn't seen her do in years

""Mom?""he remembered saying, with concern in his voice.

After a few moments, she walked alway and came back with a shoe box. 

""When your father passed, I found this in the attic.""

She opened the box.  When the man peered into the box his mom had opened, he was speechless. On top was the article he was sent in the text message about  the bus accident. Then there was the same photo of him and his parents that was sent to him. There were also a couple of letters, a key, and a couple of receipts.

""What...what...is this?"" He remembered struggling to get the words out. 

""I really don't know. But after you were born, I always thought your father was hiding something from me.""

Shortly after that, he left his mother's house with the box. When he got home, he  showed it to his wife and told her everything that happened.

""You may want to find out what all of this means, or....you may not. The fact that there is a death certificate involved scares me. ""

He remembered telling his wife, ""You're right, I do need to figure out what's going on. But you don't need to be scared. I'm sure it's nothing on THAT level."" He hadn't felt so confident on the inside that what he said was true.

A week of reviewing the death certificate and trying to figure out what the key went to led to the train ride he was on. Headed to Aurora, IL, in hopes of getting some answers. 

The man walked back to his roommette to sit alone as the train entered Illinois. He reached into his pocket for his phone but pulled out the key that was in the box. As he flipped it between his fingers, cool and unfamiliar. Whatever it opened, he hoped he was ready for it.",1,1747241935.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

question in the title!   
I've experienced several times that jammers degrade the 'game designer' (or any other) role, usually particularly programmers. Why is that and do you have any strategies to set them straight?  
  
Below is just the personal drama in case anyone is interested...   
  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\_  
I am the organizer of an in-person jam. Usually we get around 30-50 people. A friend suggested their friend for our team so I said 'okay'. When we had our compatibility brief she, a novice programmer, hit me with 'oh, so you're our assistant then' when I said I'd be our team's game designer. It was very hurtful.  
  
I know being the designer is one of the less important roles in a jam because you have to focus on one main gameplay feature and you don't have time for level design,  balancing, etc. but it feels degrading for her to infantilize me and my efforts so much.  
  
My job will be facilitating the game design by teaching my team how to paper prototype together & bring my box for that before finalizing the design for them to implement. Then I'll do jack-of-all-trade (because you just don't need design for the whole of the jam) stuff like drawing backgrounds, finding and implementing suitable sound, writing any narrative we might need and making our itch page. 

I am also a proficient artist but I want to focus on being a designer instead because I also have to fulfill the host's duties and take care of holding presentations, answering participants questions so I cannot be both artist & designer.

When I explained that we always organize a snack corner to encourage jammers to chat even with other teams she hit me with 'cool, so you'll bring us coffee?'

Today she wrote in our chat that our jam coincides with another big gaming event by 'extremely well-known gaming studio' and then wrote a whole clarifying section on what that studio makes as if anyone even mildly interested in gaming would not know.

I'm just like...girl, I've been doing this for several years. This is your first jam. Why are you being like this? do you have no concept of anything besides programming being important for your game/ basic human respect?

If she starts this shit again at any time I'll kick her out of my team. We don't allow this kind of hierarchal bullshit at our jam at all, but for some reason I'm always to nice to tell people like this to fuck off.

Now:  
\- I am looking to upgrade and read through quite a few posts that were asking for grinder advice. I get that the Niche Zero is probably my best option although the DF64 would already be a big upgrade for me probably.   
I drink dark and medium roasts and mostly make cortados/cappucinos or espresso.   
I am pretty much at the point where I am like fuck this and just order the Niche Zero but also trying to make a smart decision especially due to pricing because I can get the DF64 locally for 310 eur while the Niche comes out at about 726 eur.   
I am just wondering if this difference in price is justifiable?  
Bonus question because I have not yet recieved an answer from Niche but do the prices listed on their website inlcude the UK VAT? It is listed at  £449.00 on the website and it says you don't pay UK VAT but your local VAT in case it is shipped outside of the UK just not sure if they are showing the net or gross price.

I left the city because of burnout and spent six months at home recovering. I started to feel a bit better—more like myself. But then I had a huge argument with my dad (who’s likely undiagnosed autistic and very controlling), so I moved in with my sister, sleeping on her sofa.

Her mental health’s not great, and she told me she can’t keep worrying about me on top of everything else. So now I’m back in the city, staying with my partner temporarily while we try to save to move somewhere else. He lives in a shared house with five others, so there’s no real privacy.

Something about this city feels unbearable since I’ve unmasked. It’s too busy, overstimulating, relentless. Summer makes it worse. I can’t even go to the beach—it’s always packed. When I lived with my sister, I could at least find quiet spaces to walk. Here, every outing is exhausting.

I’ve been having near-daily meltdowns. I rely on my partner for everything because I have no autonomy here. I’d just started to regain confidence—going out for coffee on my own, feeling small sparks of independence. Now it feels like I’m right back where I started.

Yesterday, I managed a workout for the first time in ages, but one of the housemates messaged the group chat asking why the house was shaking. They weren’t rude, but now I’m too self-conscious to do it again.

I just feel like I can’t *live* here. There’s nowhere I can go to be alone. No quiet. No space that feels like mine. Every peaceful place is only reachable by packed buses or trains. I don’t have anywhere else to go, and no one really understands. I just need somewhere safe and quiet, somewhere I can breathe, walk, and exist without being overwhelmed.

Just looking for someone to relate because I know there isn't really a solution to this.

First time posting here, but I would like you insight/advice or even knowledge, if you can possibly understand what is going on, because I can't think straight anymore. (Also sorry for the long post)

  
I (36F) just broke up a few days ago with my bf of one year (36M) - well, he actually broke up with me.  
There was this girl on Instagram which I asked him about. He claimed that they have absolutely no hisotry, but something in my gut said otherwise. Later that night while he was asleep and I was scrolling on my phone, her account was again recommended to me so I went to check. I noticed there were a few pictures from the area he lives and is from, which were matching the dates that I know his last relationship occured.  
The next morning I woke up with such an awful feeling inside me, and decided to check his phone (yes, I know, jerk move, but at the same time I don't think a couple in a serious relationship needs to have a private life or secrets from each other).

That's where the shitshow started. I go to search her name on Instagram. Please note, his search was cleared very recently (yes I have caught him clearing his search since he saw me paying attention to it). So! I open the convo with her, and it appears that a couple years ago he was telling her ""hey, I really want to see you if you want too.."" which to me it proves that there is at least SOME kind of history, because otherwise why would anyone send that to someone? But that's besides the reason I'm wiriting here today!

  
Now let's go back to me using his Insta search bar. As mentioned, history was cleared recently, so there were only two profiles searched. The hot pilates instructor-sister of one of his friends (no he is not friends with her and no they don't talk or hang out (so to me, super creepy and yucky behaviour) and most importantly! an account with no actual name - only random letters and numbers (looked smth like ""II00R5..."").  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order for a profile to appear on your search history (before typing anything of course), you have to have typed it yourself, before.  
The photo on this profile was a completely naked woman with only two tiny emoji stars on each boob. He had not only searched that profile, but also requested to follow it - and no that account was not following him. On that picture, it also had written ""PERVERTED SINNER"", which in my original language it sounds WAAAAAY more profound.

I waited till he got up this Sunday, I made him coffee and when he sat by me, I asked him again about the first girl. Are you sure there is no past? Is there something you would like to share with me? Was there any attraction ever on either side? Nooo Noooooo,no no no, stop thinking this way, do you want me to delete her? Fine I don't even care (btw the previous day he was telling me of how supporting she had been to him when they met at art school (she is much younger as he told me) and that she is not his type AT ALL. So he again denied everything. He got up to go to the bathroom (with his phone) and that's when I started losing my cool. I say to him from behind the door ""perverted sinner""??? He was like what?! I say again, perverted sinner? Does that ring a bell? -What are you talking about. He comes out he tells me he was no clue what I'm even referring to. Gaslit to the GODS.

I told him I checked his phone and I saw in the search history this profile. Still he has no idea where I'm coming from.He doesn't know any profile like that, he doesn't remember anything like that (btw HE NEVER DOES). So I said, it's ok. Let's check together and find out who and what that profile was, and he's acting all nonchalant like yeah, sure. And then it HIT ME. I told him, if i go to your phone right now and the search history on Insta is gone, then I don't even know how I'm gonna react. GUESS WHAT!!!! it was freaking goooooone. So as the idiot I am, I never took a photo or a screenshot, and of course since the name of the account looke like a code, there would be noway for me to find it (unless she allows his follow request).

So my question for you (besides being the ahole) is:  
What the hell could that profile be, why did it only have letters and numbers for a name, how could he find it by searching and why would he be searching it - because there is no way I can get clarity otherwise.

PS. I had found more profiles like that which he followed, but this was by far the most profound one.

I appreciate your time, hopefuly someone could help me clarify things for my tired brain.

He’s our first child. I’m taking college classes full-time and stay home with him instead of putting him in daycare. To socialize us, I’ve been going to the local library preschool story time that’s offered twice a week in the mornings for ages 0-3.

During story time the other kids sit and listen. They interact with the teacher and sing songs along with her. At the end there’s a free play with toys, most of the other kids play nicely. 

My son doesn’t do any of that. I’ve tried arriving early and acclimating him before everyone gets there, that doesn’t work. I try gentle parenting, explaining things in short phrases, participating myself, verbally redirecting him, physically redirecting him—nothing works. 

He’s constantly off running around, being loud, not sitting, looking at other people’s belongings, literally leaving the conference room to run around the library. This doesn’t just apply to there. This happens everywhere we go. 

Recently one of the other Mom’s at the library referred me to a Facebook page for local Moms to plan meetups with their kids. I’ve tried going to a few and his behavior is like this everywhere we go. He’s only interested in the other kids like the first few minutes but then he’s off running around, picking up garbage off the ground. Literally fascinated with garbage—used gum, rotten food, dead bugs, a wrapper, a sticky cup full of old coffee and milk, a dirty diaper full of poop, an old shirt someone threw on the ground, a piece of candy, a half-eaten sandwich, a water bottle cap, etc. 

He’s not interested in playing with other children or using the equipment designated for kids. I’m constantly in panic crisis mode trying to manage his behavior. 

It makes it incredibly hard to try to socialize and make friends with the other moms or have friends that are his age! I can’t even introduce myself I’m always chasing after him and trying to minimize the meltdown. 

My partner’s brother has self-diagnosed autism, but I can definitely tell his mother has autism and ADHD. So I’m concerned that his behavior might be early warning signs of that. How do you know? When I do the pediatric appointments the paper forms don’t point to anything like that, and I’ve brought it up but the doctor says he’s completely normal. 

If this is normal—how can I control it? How do I change it so he behaves like the other children who are listening? He literally throws himself on the ground and scream cries and kicks his legs.

About 8 weeks ago, my former boss, who had confirmed my position for the summer, started ghosting me. I, of course, did not think of it as ghosting, maybe just being busy, but now, of course, it was ghosting. I would leave a voicemail for her 1-2 times a week, asking for updates on the first day to be left with nothing.

  
3 weeks ago, 2 weeks before my junior year was finished, she sent me an email saying that they had to cut the internship program due to budget cuts and the current state of the economy.

I am wondering the following:

\- I have had an internship after my freshman and sophomore year (sophomore year being the internship I worked at and had been dropped from this year); will not having the internship this summer be affecting any applications after graduation?

\- If I end up working at some place not pertaining to my engineering degree (pizza/ coffee shop), what can I do this summer to still show that I am working with my degree?

I do a dirty fast where I drink coffee with cream but I keep it under 100 calories. I'm doing IF for weight management, I don't care about autophagy. My TDEE is about 1600 calories with a maintenance of about 2000. Daily, I'm keeping my intake at 1650-1850. 

So my question is, am I just not waiting long enough or am I not losing? I feel like I should be seeing a couple pounds consistently down in 2 weeks. My weight is going down but it just goes right back up to the same spot again. If I'm losing fat, when the scale fluctuates up, wouldn't my weight still be trending downwards?",3,1747241432.0,intermittentfasting,7,1.0,False

1kmk3fo,https://i.redd.it/ciepd3hjpr0f1,Catching the Wind in Cleveland,"“Every Catholic knows he could’ve been Pope” - MJ Lenderman sings, the crowd roars.

You have heard of FOMO, Fear of Missing Out. Let me tell you about FOMAA TEITA, Fear Of Misunderstanding An Artist That Everyone Is Talking About. I think in the literate dad rock & indie spaces in which I travel, this feeling can really tickle & taunt me as a devout music fan who wants to get haunted by what the serious music critics are haunted by.  

Last year during the deluge of MJ Lenderman hype on the occasion of the Manning Fireworks album release, I felt left out, like I was missing out. Mostly on the first listen, it was “what am I missing,” this is okay, but . . . . 

Over on Reddit, I encountered the theory that the enthusiasm about MJ Lenderman had been manufactured by a particularly well-played press-cycle for a new album. Basically, whatever this album & artist are, they are the golden-ticket golden-child holy-grail of the hipster-reviewer indie-music-influencer industrial complex. 

There were times past when everyone I knew was talking about Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens, Wilco, and even Arcade Fire, all at times when I was not feeling it. I finally came around for Wilco hard when a Wilco-fan dear friend passed away. I still dabble in Stevens & Radiohead but no deep dives lately. Let’s not even talk about Arcade Fire, who could be Morgan Wallen as far as I am concerned at this point.

Sometimes I just give up. Other times, I go deeper. This time I went deeper.

To paraphrase & amplify the buzz: MJ “Jake” Lenderman is the second coming in scruffy slacker indie rock, the woozy witticist wordsmith of weird sports references & joyfully survived youthful Catholicism, the steward of the Asheville sound & its psych twang bangers, the direct link to the dead poets society of Jason Molina & David Berman, with strong ties to Neil Young & Will Oldham. 

To put it plain, I didn’t get in the font after first listens, had to listen more, imbibe the hype & get dunked in the larger context of fellow travelers like Fust, Florry, Styrofoam Winos, Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band. So I decided to do what I often do in situations like this: spend too much on a road-trip pilgrimage to find my place in the sold-out crowd & let the intuitive earholes & vibrating body assign what visions & physical sound epiphanies, as they may.   

Halfway into the road trip with the return arc before me, sucking coffee in the rented room with morning after appreciation, I don’t know that I am a superfan as there are so many artists sparkling up my soul at this time & vying for my superfan time, but I am grateful I got to see MJ Lenderman & his incredible band during this season of much appreciation & reputation ascent. Mostly I got to shake & spin & wave & whirl & enjoy 105 minutes of music magic in a city where I lived as a young child, so visiting here always feels primal & needed as well.

I guess I'd rather you take your loud and disrespectful kids to a designated spot, but do you REALLY REALLY need to drink there too? Wine moms are out of hand istg

This cafe is in the downtown area in a historic house (that no one can live in now) and they built a playground in the backyard, but they pretty much only have younger kid toys (like toddler age) for their play area. The whole vibe is marketed towards moms and the coffee/pastries are okay but expensive, but they serve draft beer and wine as well????? There's literally a brewery not even a block away from this place that allows kids but it's not ""kid friendly enough"" for them 🥴 Sorry that not every adult space is chill with your screaming kids busting their head open on the asphalt! Their hours are from 7a-8p Wednesday-Sunday sooooo I guess it's for SAH mom's?

For context, I live in a smallish city/large town in the south with a 4 year college, but the demographics are pretty poor and rural. My in-laws own a well-established and successful coffee shop,,, and these people have decided to have a personal vendetta against them 🙃 As in they're trying to ""outplay"" a place that's nearly 30 years old. They have some board games and toys for kids, but it's still a place for students to chill and study, y'know? (Also they apparently have a ""former employee"" who knows allll the recipes (like they aren't literally on the menu) and they don't add any ""hidden fees 😡"" or tips to their drinks!!1!!!!!)

Some people INSIST on bring their kids up to my in-laws shop for homeschooling. I was literally homeschooled and can say that loudly reading to your child in a public area AIN'T IT but that's a whole other story.

Obviously I have the freedom to not visit their establishment, but this just seems ridiculous, right?? Like who in their right mind would casually *drink and drive with their children*?? Ofc I'm CF and never having kids but isn't that your most precious cargo??

From looming dread to eager anticipation to unhealthy skepticism... are we going to keep this momentum? I don't know how to channel this love that still drives me towards someone that is already gone. 

Hope is cruel, but I will figure out how to strangle it in silence. You already know what I want, and you want something else. I have seen you, all of you, the ""true you"" that you got so good at hiding. I want that, I want her, the girl behind the mask and all of her raw thoughts and emotions and flaws. I want her to come home to me after hot yoga. I want her to present to me her perceived imperfections, her self-conscious thoughts, her doubts... And then show her so intimately how none of that matters to me. She's all I've ever wanted.

How do I keep this from collapsing in on itself? We both know I'm hurting. I know you are too, in your own way, but you carry that mask so well. How do I see you looking up at me with those begging coffee eyes, knowing that it's the last time? Will I be able to keep my composure? Hope is cruel indeed, but caution has no place in my heart right now. I crave you, and I will have you again even if it truly is the last time we see each other. I have no choice but to accept that it will be, and match your energy accordingly.

My life will not be on pause. While you chase those city skylines and some intangible, undefinable fulfillment, I will be moving forward towards a life without you that I hadn't planned. A blank canvas, I suppose, to make a world of color of my own that will smother the void left behind.  Don't be a stranger, but don't be a friend. I know you will always think about coming back and surrendering to that primal chemistry that can only exist in our dynamic. I will always be your ""what if"", that feeling in the back of your mind that you just can't shake. You will always wonder, and I will have no choice but to let you.

Was it something we said? Goldman Sachs has changed up its ongoing coverage of non-alcoholic beverage sales data as provided by NielsenIQ, and it’s a little bit less detailed than we’re used to seeing. Here’s what you need to know:

📊 Some categories enjoyed a sales lift during the Easter holiday: in the 4-wks, CSDs (+6.5%), energy drinks (see below), and non-alc beer (+25.6%) picked up speed. Tea (+7.1%) and sparkling water (+8%) also rose.

That wasn’t the case in sports drinks (-3.9% for 4-wks) or RTD coffee (-4.1%).

Growth slowed across the spectrum in the 2-wks, with the exception of a slight reversal for sports drinks (-3.1%).

Coca-Cola (+6.9% for 4-wks) and KDP (+6.1%) were both up, but Pepsi slipped 3%.

⚡ The Goldman data set doesn’t break down by category, so we can’t tell how much a portfolio like KDP (C4/Ghost/Bloom/Black Rifle) is driving energy drink growth (+10.4% for 2-wks/+11.1% for 4-wks) or how sales gains are reflected in volume and pricing.

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I check my users and i saw 3 digits. You know the one with 2 0’s and a 1""user count: 100"" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is a no-code waitlist creation tool that helps founders validate their product ideas by using waitlists. It automates every single step of the process, including an easy to use dashboard, built in analytics and a db already connected so you can track your signups right in the dashboard.

It’s aimed at small businesses, indie hackers, and anyone who wants an easy way to automate the process of building a waitlist. And clearly, there’s a lot of people out there out there who saw enough value.

Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. These 100 users are so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to to actually use it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Honestly, I think that this time he really doesn't care about this, dealing with his estranged father. He has other priorities. He looks different. Not interested in being sarcastic, mean, superior.

I want a \*single\* boiler and had asked multiple times here. I just managed to decide between the Gaggia Classic Pro E24 or the Profitec Go. In my opinion I would go with the Gaggia Classic Pro, but here is where I want your opinion.

I know I will make good coffee with both of those machines. The only issue I am having is that the GCP E24 can only be bought from Whole Latte Love, and I have seen many bad reviews complaining about the customer service.

This is what is the main point driving me away from buying that cheaper machine and spending more money on the Profitec Go with another company that has a better customer service.

I would like to spend less and buy the Gaggia Classic Pro E24, but I am not entirely sure that is the best choice if some issues start to happen with the mchine.

I'm looking for someone to hang out with online. Someone who's okay with both super noisy fun and just chilling in comfortable silence.

Think of it like this: we can be totally chaotic together – lots of laughing, talking about anything and everything (NSW only please!), maybe even some silly and serious rants and fun gossip. But then, when we're both tired or just need to chill, we can also just be quietly online together, maybe listening to music or just knowing the other person is there. No pressure to talk all the time!  We can also help keep each other on track with our goals! Let's be accountability buddies too!

A little about me:

* I'm 31 years old (turning 32 this year)
* Working pro. I work a lot! Still chasing those big dreams. 😅
* I'm a bit chubby, but I've been working out at home and jogging lately. Just wanted to be upfront about that in case it matter.
* Things I like include: getting lost in books, watching movies and anime, doing cute cross-stitch projects, trying yummy food (I'm a foodie!), my daily coffee fix, all things cats and dogs, and taking little trips to just anywhere every few months.
* Once I get comfortable, I can talk your ear off! (But in real life, after about 2-3 hours of straight talking, my social battery needs a serious recharge, LOL!)

What I'm hoping for in you:

* Someone who also likes to chat a lot during free time or something
* Someone who's looking for a consistent online friend.
* Ideally around my age (31-ish) so we probably have similar life experiences to talk about.
* Someone who's, you know, alive and breathing well. 😉
* It would be awesome if you liked at least one of the things I like so we always have something to chat about!
* Someone who prefer to chat or call on Discord, not Telegram please!

Basically, just be yourself! The rest isn't a big deal. I'm looking for a friend not a Mr. Universe.

P.S. If you know any awesome hidden coffee shops or cafes in Metro Manila, please let me know! I'm always on the hunt for a good one. ☕",2,1747240902.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

Well, K, knowing that her ex was my boyfriend’s best friend, ran to my boyfriend right after they broke up and started getting my boyfriend to talk to her ex for her. Well, a month passes, and she’s over her ex, but she’s still constantly talking to my boyfriend. At one point, my boyfriend had two essays he needed to write and he was stressing out big time. I offered to help and finished one for him, when I asked about the second one, he said “oh yeah, K wrote it for me.” I didn’t view that as weird at all, until I told him to text her saying I appreciate her help. Her texts between him were always very vibrant, but when she replied to that, all she said was “k.” This is when it struck me as strange.

Well, a few more weeks pass and she starts coming up when me and my boyfriend are together only talking to him, not acknowledging me whatsoever. She waves to him in the halls, and when he would wait for me to get to school in the mornings, she’d be with him. Anyhow, around January, I simply brought up the topic of her, and all I told my boyfriend is “I’m not completely comfortable with everything, but if yall are friends that’s okay, just be careful please.” Well, he told me after that “if you’re not comfortable, then I’m not going to talk to her anymore.” I asked if he was sure a few times, and he replied with “yes, completely sure. I’m going to tell her we shouldn’t talk anymore.” Afterwards, we moved on with our lives.

It wasn’t until about February when everything happened. One morning I came to school and my boyfriend wasn’t where he usually was waiting, though he was at school. I texted a few texts asking “hey are you okay, where are you?” To which five minutes later he replied, “coming. Stay there.” He then showed up with a full cup of coffee and an energy drink. I asked “woah, where’d you get these from?” And he said, “oh I ran into some friends, and they handed me them. Here, you want some?” I thought nothing of it.. until about an hour later when he came up to me in shambles. He asked me “I need to tell you something, please don’t be mad.” I said “depends.” So he said “I didn’t cheat but.. you know K?” My heart immediately sank. He said “well, I’ve been texting her and hanging out with her sometimes in the mornings and between classes, and just now she and her friend took me to go and get some coffee because I walked up to them saying I was tired and stuff. I know you said you didn’t want me talking to her anymore, and I’m really sorry.” 

I got extremely hurt and upset about that. To me, it almost felt like he did cheat. Especially since he always makes me tell him everything in my life, and then he hid a whole girl from me that he knew I wasn’t comfortable with. He also always gets insecure when I talk to either girls or guys, and always says he’s so scared of me leaving and cheating. Since then, we’re still together, and he completely cut her off now, but I haven’t fully recovered. 

AIO for feeling like he basically cheated and can’t trust him??

I'm currently looking to upsize my apartment, and would feel just a tad more comfortable if my partner and I had a bit more income. As it stands, my manager and shifts have spoken NUMEROUS times about the fact that they think I would perform really well as a shift. I really enjoy this line of work, the intensity of a good morning peak, the interactions, and would love to stay in coffee for a while if I can make it work. Obviously, not every day at the bux is a great day. But I seriously think I am just the right person to navigate this sort of customer service environment.

So, to reiterate– Shift leads past and present, is it worth it to look into a promotion? What was the hardest part of getting used to being a shift? What other tips do you have for a barista looking into a more 'important' role?

I'm targeting to move in late May or June, preferably downtown, Short North, Italian Village, or Grandview, but I'm also open to other locations in greater Columbus (within walking distance of fun stuff and good food primarily). Price-wise the max spending limit for my portion is $1300 monthly, but I'm looking for something lower to save some money.

I drink occasionally and don't smoke, I volunteer on Wednesdays, and I have a kind of project that I'll be working on for the next year so I'll probably keep to myself at times. Weekdays I try to hit the gym every day, so if the place has a good gym that'd be a plus. I'm also trying to be a lot more active in the community, so if you're into that too, we could team up.

Review Inside!,"The GoveeLife H717D Smart Ice Maker brought something entirely new to my kitchen game, and I have to admit, I’ve had a ton of fun putting it through its paces. Balancing convenience, smart integration, and sheer productivity, it’s great for anyone who can't imagine a day without access to fresh ice on demand. That being said, while there's much to appreciate, there are certain points to consider. Here’s my experience (and a little bit of my family’s too) using this portable ice machine over the past few weeks. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this ice maker was its sleek, modern silver aesthetic—it looks right at home next to my stainless steel appliances. Measuring 12.52 x 9.45 x 13.11 inches and weighing 16.8 pounds, it’s compact enough to fit on a countertop without dominating the space. It includes a magnetic scoop and an ergonomic ice basket that holds up to 1.5 pounds of ice, making it an ideal size for both home kitchens and small parties. The built-in RGB lights, which can be customized with the app, add a dash of personality to an already impressive design. However, the exterior collects smudges more easily than I’d like, which might necessitate a bit of regular wiping if that matters to you.  

**Performance: Bullet Ice in Record Time**  
This little powerhouse is advertised to whip up nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in six minutes, and it doesn't over-promise. The first batches were right on time, ticking in at just over six minutes, even in my warmer-than-usual kitchen. The 2-liter water tank capacity allows it to churn out up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, which was more than sufficient even when I had family over during the weekend. The feature of having three different ice sizes is a bonus because we like our drinks differently (my partner insists on smaller ice cubes for cocktails, while I prefer the larger ones for iced coffee). That said, these ice cubes are bullet-shaped and melt more slowly than regular ones, though they aren’t ideal for filling water bottles owing to their relatively wide girth.

**Smart Integration and Voice Control**  
One standout feature is the smart functionality. Pairing it with Wi-Fi was a breeze (though it supports only 2.4GHz networks). Having Alexa and Google Assistant integration instantly made me feel fancy because who doesn’t want to tell their appliances what to do? The app experience has been smooth so far, letting me monitor ice levels, set schedules, and even customize the colors of the RGB basket lighting. My kids think the glowing ice basket is the coolest thing in the world—my youngest even tried to use it as a night light, much to my amusement. Notifications about water refills and when the basket is full are handy, but the beeping alerts might be annoying for some. Fortunately, those can be turned off through the app.  

**Convenience with Self-Cleaning**  
Hands down, one of my favorite features has to be the self-cleaning mode. It takes just 10 minutes, saving me a lot of time and hassle scrubbing the machine manually. I customized the intervals using the app, ensuring it stays spotless and ready for action at all times. If you’re like me and hate the idea of grime or residue lurking where your ice is made, this feature alone is worth its weight in gold. Still, it’s important to note that the instruction manual recommends handling the unboxing and setup carefully to avoid potential damages, which could be frustrating if you’re less patient.

**Strengths**  
- Reliable production of up to 26 pounds of bullet-shaped ice per day.  
- Smart capabilities including app controls, notifications, and voice assistant integration.  
- Compact, countertop-friendly size with customizable RGB lighting.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks, which may require adjustments for users with modern setups.  
- Beeping notifications, though manageable, can sometimes be annoying.  
- Lacks a cooling function to keep ice frozen once made—must act quickly or transfer ice to a freezer.  

**Product Comparisons**  
In exploring competing options like the GE Profile Opal and Igloo ICEB26BK Automatic Ice Maker, it’s clear that the GoveeLife H717D shines in smart integration features. Many rival models boast larger capacities but skip on app controls or voice assistant support entirely. The GE Opal, for instance, produces similar nugget ice and has a more premium feel but costs considerably more. On the other hand, the Igloo model might be more affordable but lacks the custom size feature and techiness that make the GoveeLife so appealing. The choice really revolves around your priorities: a tech-savvy ice maker or a more basic solution?

**True Value**  
For all the innovation packed into this machine, I’d say the investment feels justified. Where else will you find a portable ice maker that not only accommodates three sizes but also listens to your Alexa commands, boasts RGB lights, and cleans itself? Sure, there are more budget-friendly options on the market, but they miss out on a lot of these advanced features. The lack of a cooling element might seem like a drawback, but as long as you’re prepared to store your ice promptly, it isn’t a dealbreaker. For tech-loving families—especially those that entertain regularly—this product leans closer to “worth every penny” territory.

My fiancee and I are moving back from Europe to my house in the US. She's quite accustomed to all in one/bean2cup espresso machines and would like one at my house too. 

Side note, everyone here has one of these, they're extremely popular from my observation.

  
My budget is about $2000, it could be higher if there was something really worth it. We don't care for milk options, so espresso, lungo, americano, etc is all we're after. I know a separate espresso and grinder is the best bang for buck and best coffee, but it's more important to us to place a cup, press a button and walk away. The machine would be used on average \~3-4 times a day

I've been watching some videos and doing some research but I'm curious what the folks here think. It's hard to search specifically for machines that don't bother with milk features, and hone specifically in on the best built in grinder and espresso.

I feel like Normcore’s 53.3mm was designed for Sage/Breville stock baskets, which taper down nearly immediately from opening. With them, there is the same play at the top of the movement, but it centralizes as you push down a bit. In the IMS straight walled basket it has too much play throughout movement IMO. I almost always get some loose coffee on the sides of the tamper and the top section of the basket.

Sometimes I see what looks like a small gap on one side of the basket after extraction, but I might be imagining things…

Kinuha nya akong external advisor kasi he believes on my expertise as a researcher. Di ko naman di matanggihan kasi need ko din ng money since he's willing to pay for every consultation nman.

For context, we've known each other since 2019 as FWB. That time, fresh grad ako and he was struggling financially to finance his education so he was engaged in sex work. Eventually, we stopped the sex thing and remained friends and we are still friends to this day. May jowa (22BiMale) na sya, (Aron) ngayon and I also met him din for some drinks since we hung out often nman. Since then, sinabi na sakin ni Benji na parang may pagtingin si Aron sakin and that he's okay with it. From then on, patay malisya lng ako kasi I respect Benj being in an official relationship with Aron, despite Aron knowing na may naganap samin in the past. They even invited me to be in a throuple with them kaso ayoko kasi nananaig yung conservative side of myself. But they were open to the thought of it.

Today, he asked my help to revise his final paper. Syempre tropa tropa nlang din so okay nlang. I invited him to my office kasi busy din sa work and para mas convenient for me kasi di nako babyahe to some nearby coffee shops for a consultation. He went to my office around 3pm til 7pm. After nun, di pa kami tapos kasi marami yung pinaparevise ng panelists ni Benji so napunta kami sa bahay nila to continue kasi may chores din sya and I worked with Benj until past 9pm. In the middle of our conversations, there were, ""Siguro kung naging tayo...."" segments

""Siguro kung naging tayo, tataba lang tayo kasi puro tayo kain at inom.""
""Siguro kung naging tayo, susunduin kita everyday sa work mo.""
""Siguro kung naging tayo, baka everyday may bembang.""
""Siguro kung naging tayo, magtatagal to.""
""Siguro kung nung time na nagkita tayo ulit tapos wla tayong mga jowa, magiging tayo tlaga.""

and many more...

For the 6hrs we've been together on that single day, kahit na laser-focused ako as an advisor, those ""what if""'s sunk to me eventually na baka ganun din yung outcome tlaga. I'm not confused to the point that I'd accept the throuple offer. Ayoko nun. Gusto ko kami lng ni Benj. But he's bound to Aron and I'm happy for the both of them. Benj told me that he's glad na nagkarelasyon sila ni Aron because Aron became his safe space.

Siguro inggit lang ito kasi mag-isa lang ako. Pero okay lang ako. I just want to confess na, if in the future or in the next life, I can have Benji, di ko sya pakakawalan. I just admire him from a distance and I wish no ill-will between Benj and Aron. I support their dynamics. They're definitely built different. Their peace is theirs and I will find mine.

I will just admire them from a distance. I hope I find my peace also kahit sa sarili ko nlang makita basta di lang tlaga ako makakadestroy ng relationship ng ibang tao",1,1747239840.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

The first time, it feels sacred.  
You listen to the brittle crack of each bean,  
watch the powder gather like dark soil,  
lifting the scent to your face as if it might say something.  
It warms you, maybe sweet, maybe bitter  
But you notice. That first time.  

By the fifth time, your hands still move the same,  
but you don’t really notice.  
By the tenth, you forget why you even cared enough to start.  

Funny how repetion dulls things.  
Even ""I love you"".  
Say it enough times and it begins to blur.  
I love you, I love-you, I love-ou, I luvu,  
I-oveu? What even is that?  

Buy someone enough flowers,  
and the colors fade into habit.  
The fragrance thins.  
You still bring them.  
But you’re not sure what for.  

Let someone cross your boundary,  
It withers,  
And as it fades,  
So do you,  
Until small becomes your shape,  
And numb becomes your native tongue.  

Had I brewed my with intention,  
the taste might have lingered.  
If I'd stop giving flowers to the silence,  
Maybe they would have bloomed in me.  
And if I hadnt begged so often for love,  
Maybe I wouldn't have learnt to starve for less.  

You live.  
You learn.  
You carry the weight  
of what you gave  
and what was never returned.

Adding a link to the Wikipedia Homepage to your Daily Note is a game-changer. I know, I know, I feel stupid that I didn't realize this before but it's really refreshed my mornings.

This all started when I spent about a week during my free time researching Anki decks and looking for repositories of knowledge that I could have pop up with spaced repetition in the morning while I ate breakfast or sipped on my coffee. Eventually, the simplest option occurred to me, I could literally just read the Wikipedia homepage and move around randomly afterwards for 10-20 minutes as I started my day. The homepage is updated daily and there's also a Current Events tab that gives you the news without all the flash and distracting colors of the regular news websites (although I also have a link to an Edge workspace with my favorite news sites listed in it - I'm working on learning how to make an RSS feed of news so I can cut Edge out of my workflow. I don't know anything about computers, so I'm learning still). There are even Portals that you can access on a subject that's relevant to you. It's made my mornings more fun and gives me a comfortable start to my work day while I learn about new things.

Right now I use the Open Link With plugin and have my middle mouse button set to open internal links with the Obsidian Web Viewer. Reading Wikipedia inside Obsidian feels smoother somehow, and if the article I'm reading feels cool or interesting, I can just have Obsidian save the page to my vault, and I then turn that page into a source note for my zettelkasten.
