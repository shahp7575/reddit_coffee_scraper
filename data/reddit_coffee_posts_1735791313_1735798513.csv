My Dr told me that he would give it to me for a month and if I didn't lose any weight we would stop it. Well I don't have a way to weigh myself but I feel as if I have lost nothing. The medicine don't give me any energy and it's not suppressing my appetite at all . Ugh I feel sad I see some people losing 30 pounds in a month an I feel like I've lost nothing... Ugh my Dr office is closed till the 6th. I took my last pill today so now I have to wait till the 6th with no medicine so I guess we will see what happens. Has anyone else took this for a month without any results. Honesty I really dont eat much. I don't eat healthy but I only eat a snack drink some coffee and one meal a day idk what my deal is . I'm also on a hypothyroidism medication that I've been on for 2 months I don't feel like it's helping any either. My Dr said something that made me feel as if he thinks I'm always eating that's why I gained weight ect but that's not the case. Most of the day I don't eat at all. Not  bc the medicine is making me not eat , that just how I was before I even took the medicine. coffee in the morning we will say 7 to. 8am then I might have a snack around 1-3 a small snack.

By the time lunch rolled around, I realized I’d been running on nothing but coffee and sheer willpower. My chest felt tight, my head was spinning, and all I wanted to do was hide under my desk.

In that moment, I knew I had to hit pause. I stepped outside, took a deep breath, and walked around the block. It wasn’t a long walk, but it gave me enough clarity to tackle the rest of the day. Later, I scheduled some time for yoga, my go-to stress reliever, and treated myself to a quiet evening with my favorite book.

Stress at work is inevitable, but how we handle it can make all the difference. What about you? How do you manage stress when it feels like work is too much?

1hrmvo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1hrmvo9/glucose_spikes/,Glucose spikes?,"So, obvious caveats, this is not medical advice, talk to your doctor, etc. i just wanted to share some personal experiences. The big takeaway is that I was having severe migraine issues, I made some changes, and now I'm having fewer migraine issues.

Some history: I've had like, one migraine every five–ten years throughout my life (early forties), but a couple years ago, something must have changed, and I started having one a month for about six months. That frequency wasn't the issue. The issue was my postdromes would last for about two weeks, and I was a shadow of my usual self during the postdromes. I was confused and scared all the time. After it all cleared up, my wife told me that she had missed me for the past six months. I could scrape by doing the bare minimum at work, but I really wasn't present anywhere.

Anyway, I can't speak to cause and effect, but I can point to a change I made around the time my migraines cleared up. It involves glucose spiking. There's a history of diabetes on both sides of my family, so I've had my eye on blood sugar stuff for a while. Basically, I had a couple of small migraines in Summer 2023, but I was also in Hanoi, so I chalked it up to being in a different environment and working too hard. When I got back home, my wife showed me a book (I know, I know), but not for migraines, just health in general. I bought into it, and haven't had a migraine since, except for one while I was coming off of horse tranquilizers for a kidney stone (my first, yippie!) in between some long flights, so when that one hit I wasn't even mad. I was just like, ""well, yeah, fair.""

So, the main change I made is that I start almost every day with a handful of veggies (not a smoothie, not a juice, just the green crunchy things) before eating any sugary stuff, if it's convenient. The idea is that the fiber goes into your GI system first, and slows down the sugar absorption. The nice thing about this new practice is that it's not an all or nothing thing. It's just like, do it if you can, and if not, oh well. I usually keep a bag of carrots or lettuce in the fridge, and just pretend to be a brontosaurus while I make my coffee. I literally grab a handful and munch it while my water boils in the morning. I think of it like medicine. I don't spend twenty minutes making a salad, or fiddling with machines. I eat the food. It takes less than thirty seconds. People always wanna hit me with, ""well I don't like veggies,"" or ""can't you make a tasty smoothie with protein powder,"" or whatever. I'm just saying, it's easier and more effective (for me) to just bite the bullet (or carrot?). I also try to start each meal with veggies if they're there, hit fats and proteins next, and finish with the carby stuff. So like, if there's bread sitting on the table at a restaurant, I just try to hold off and eat it after I've had some salad. If I'm eating a burger... I just eat the burger and don't worry about it. Again, the whole thing that sold me on this was that it wasn't some uber-strict black and white cult, just a, ""try to do this 80% of the time, if you can,"" unlike various diets (paleo, raw, vegan, etc.).

The second key takeaway I got from the book was to do some sort of movement/exercise within fifteen minutes of eating if possible, to give your body a way to burn excess sugar. My wife loves to go for a half-hour walk. I like to do ten squats, which takes about thirty seconds.

The book has other little tips in it, but these are the two that I've been able to do at least half the time, even with travel. It basically says to try to do these things when you can, and you should start retraining your body in a couple of weeks or so.

Aside from the reduction in migraines, I've noticed that I crave sugar less, and I'm about ninety percent less hangry overall. I also don't feel dead tired in the afternoons, and I wake up with my alarm instead of having to set five alarms and hit snooze ten times.

Well, this quick little post turned into a dang novel. Sorry! I guess it was just like, the new year, and I realized I only had one migraine in all of 2024, so I figured I'd share some good news, and see if anyone had any feedback for me. Like, have you tried any of the ""avoiding glucose spikes"" practices and had any similar results? Have you tried something similar and had no change? I'm currently planning to stick with this practice, as it correlated with fewer migraines and some other improved health benefits, at least in 2024, but I'm wondering if anyone else is thinking it's just a coincidence. Oh, the book was titled something like Glucose Revolution. It's been over a year since I actually looked at it, but I've been pretty good about at least the eating veggies and doing some squats over the past year.

tl;dr: Starting my day with a handful of veggies coincided with a drastic reduction in migraines in 2024. Curious if anyone else had similar/different correlations with glucose management.",1,1735796691.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

I recently tried some coffee beans from a different source than my usual go-to. While the coffee tasted good (though not quite as good as my standard beans), I noticed a couple of interesting things after switching back to my regular beans:

	1.	Messy Puck with the New Beans: No matter how much I adjusted the settings, the puck with the new beans was consistently messy. It was often wet, broke apart, and wasn’t well-compressed.

	2.	Grind Volume Differences: After switching back to my standard beans, I noticed that without changing any settings (grind size or duration), the standard beans produced significantly more volume when ground.

This has made me curious:
	•	Could differences in bean processing (e.g., moisture content or roasting methods) explain these reactions?
	•	Does this indicate that one set of beans is fresher or processed differently?

I’d love to learn more about what might cause these differences. If anyone has insights or similar experiences, I’d really appreciate your input!

I have a a1c of 16, a fasting of 19 and I got rushed to the er where they clocked me at 28. But in the last month I’ve been on medication and brought it all back down to 6-7.5. Still working on it but I’ve been really trying hard to stick to healthy stuff as we figure it all out. My husband has been amazing and switched all our eating habits together. 
Over the holidays it’s like my family just forgot. My grandma gave me Lindt chocolates for Christmas, no real diabète friendly dishes at dinner so I had to stick with just the meats and even the veggies were smothered in a sweet sauce.
Which, okay it’s fine. I’m the only person with diabetes in the family. It’s new. They don’t know what I can eat. They were thinking it didn’t matter blah blah blah, I could have a cheat day, blah blah blah. 
Excuse after excuse. Which at first I was fine with. It’s a shift and I didn’t check in beforehand. 
At desserts (which there was nothing for me) I asked if there was anything I could have in my coffee, any sweetener of any kind and they said that they didn’t think to buy some. I don’t normally drink coffee in my day to day but it was a special dinner/after dinner event and I always do when I go to my parents for dinner. Which isn’t often. 
Yet again this is new to them, no sweetener isn’t a big deal, I’ll survive. 
But last night I went over again. Same thing. Even when I asked if there would be something diabetic friendly. They only prepped deep fried hors d’oeuvres. And when I went for a coffee they still didn’t have sweetener. 
I know it’s not the biggest of deals. That I could have brought some myself, or brought my own food to make sure. But they were hosting. And they bend over backwards to make sure my vegetarian sister has good options, but they can’t make sure there’s one sugar free dessert or something to put in my coffee.

I just switched from nights to mornings so I’m not very familiar with the regulars. There’s this one old man who comes in often according to my coworkers & he has a problem with this one homeless guy who comes in a lot to buy coffee & something small to eat.

While I was serving someone in the drive thru I could see the old man staring & giving dirty looks to the homeless man & it was started to bother me but I didn’t know what to say. 

My manager asked me to do a coffee round because when she does it the old man always complains about the homeless man being in the restaurant & I’m pretty abrasive & can’t stand when people are rude to others.

I slammed my hands on the counter & said “that’s enough! Just because you have different financial situations doesn’t make you better than him! He’s a paying customer & he’s minding is own business. If you have a problem with him being here & keep giving him dirty looks or say one more rude thing then you can get out because we don’t tolerate harassment here.” 

Then he said something about how I should respect old people & have better customer service skills so I told him “respect is earned not given” & then the old man sat down. 

When he finished his coffee he said he was never coming back so I said “okay bye have the day you deserve!” & gave him a smile while waving.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to winemaking, the materials used during the aging process play a crucial role in determining the wine's final character. One of the most influential components is oak. Oak barrels are the traditional choice for aging various types of wine, and understanding how oak shapes flavor and texture can deepen your appreciation for your favorite bottles.

Oak wood comes from different species, each contributing unique characteristics to the wine. The most common types used in winemaking are American oak and French oak. They have distinct profiles that can significantly alter the wine's taste.

- **American Oak:** This type of oak tends to impart bold flavors such as vanilla, coconut, and caramel. It has larger pores, allowing for more oxygen to enter the barrel. This helps develop a rich mouthfeel and enhances sweetness.
- **French Oak:** French oak, on the other hand, offers more subtle nuances like spice, cocoa, and earthy notes. It has tighter grain, which allows for a slower infusion of flavors, making it ideal for wines that benefit from a gentle touch.

The choice of oak can also influence the wine's tannin structure. Tannins are compounds that can create a drying sensation in your mouth. When wine is aged in oak, it can absorb these tannins, leading to a softer mouthfeel and better integration of flavors. This is especially true for red wines, which can often be tannic and aggressive straight out of fermentation. By aging in oak, winemakers can soften these tannins, resulting in a more balanced and harmonious wine.

Check Details Here: https://sip-city.com/the-role-of-oak-in-winemaking:-impact-on-flavor-and-texture  
  
Another essential aspect is the level of toasting the oak barrels undergo. Toasting refers to the process where barrels are heated to caramelize the sugars in the wood. This affects the flavor compounds that interact with the wine. Different levels of toasting—light, medium, or heavy—yield different flavor profiles:

- **Light Toasting:** Produces delicate flavors like floral notes and fresh fruit.
- **Medium Toasting:** Adds layers of complexity, enhancing spice notes and caramel flavors.
- **Heavy Toasting:** Imparts bold and smoky characteristics, making the wine richer and more robust.

Additionally, the age of the barrel plays a pivotal role in how much influence it has on the wine. New barrels impart stronger flavors compared to older ones, which may offer more subtle complexities. Winemakers often choose between new and used barrels based on the desired outcome for their wine. New barrels are especially popular for bold reds and chardonnays, while older barrels may be used for delicate varietals like Pinot Noir.

Check Details Here: https://sip-city.com/the-role-of-oak-in-winemaking:-impact-on-flavor-and-texture  
  
Beyond flavor, oak also enhances the texture of wine. The slow oxygen transfer through the wood helps to soften and integrate the wine's components, creating a smoother mouthfeel. For white wines, especially those aged in oak, this can lead to a creamier texture. For red wines, it can enhance the wine’s body and richness, often resulting in a wine that feels more opulent on the palate.

Moreover, oak aging can add complexity to the wine's aromatics. The subtle interplay between the wine and the barrel can produce an array of aromas that might include everything from spices to sweet notes. These complexities invite you to explore the wine further, making the tasting experience more fulfilling.

Check Details Here: https://sip-city.com/the-role-of-oak-in-winemaking:-impact-on-flavor-and-texture  
  
Some winemakers are even experimenting with alternative aging methods, such as using oak chips or staves in stainless steel tanks, to mimic the effects of barrel aging without the substantial cost. While these methods can add oak characteristics, they might not replicate the same subtle integration found in traditional barrel aging.

Understanding how oak influences the flavor and texture of wine can elevate your tasting experience. The varietals you choose and the aging methods employed shape the unique character of each bottle.

So, next time you pour a glass, take a moment to consider the role oak has played in crafting the wine before you. The choice of oak can completely alter the profile, making the experience rich and exciting.

Exploring Different Types of Oak Barrels and Their Influence on Wine Characteristics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oak barrels have played a crucial role in winemaking for centuries. Each type of oak possesses unique characteristics that can significantly influence the flavor and texture of the wine, making it essential for winemakers to select the right barrel for their needs. Let’s delve into the different varieties of oak, their properties, and how they shape the wine we drink.

### The Types of Oak Commonly Used in Winemaking

Winemakers primarily use two types of oak: Quercus robur (European oak) and Quercus alba (American oak). Both offer distinct advantages and impart different qualities to the wine. Understanding these differences can help in selecting the ideal barrel for any wine variety.

#### 1. European Oak (Quercus Robur)

European oak barrels are revered for their tighter grain and more complex flavor profile. Some characteristics include:

- **Flavor Contribution:** European oak tends to produce flavors such as spice, coffee, and chocolate, which can enhance the richness of red wines.
- **Tannin Structure:** This oak has a high level of tannins, contributing to a smooth mouthfeel and greater aging potential.
- **Toast Levels:** The toasting of barrels can add further complexity, with options ranging from light to heavy toast impacting the final product.
- **Aging Capacity:** Wines aged in European oak often develop more nuanced and intricate flavors over time.

#### 2. American Oak (Quercus Alba)

American oak is known for its pronounced vanilla and coconut flavors. Key features include:

- **Flavor Profile:** This oak imparts more pronounced flavors such as vanilla, sweet spice, and caramel, making it popular for whites and some fruit-forward reds.
- **Lower Tannin Levels:** Compared to European oak, American oak typically has lower tannin content, resulting in a softer mouthfeel.
- **Less Toasting Required:** American oak often requires less toasting than European oak to impart desirable flavor notes.
- **Accessibility:** Generally, American oak barrels tend to be more affordable, making them a popular choice for many wineries.

### Influence on Wine Characteristics

The choice between European and American oak barrels can significantly affect the wine's overall character. Here’s how the type of oak impacts various aspects of the wine:

#### 1. Aroma and Flavor

During the aging process, compounds within the oak interact with the wine, enriching it with flavors and aromas. European oak often introduces earthy, herbal notes alongside spice, while American oak enhances sweeter, fruit-forward profiles. The barrel's toast level further modifies these flavors, allowing winemakers to tailor the tasting experience.

#### 2. Texture and Mouthfeel

The tannins derived from the oak also play a pivotal role in the wine's mouthfeel. Wines from European oak barrels tend to have a more pronounced tannic structure, resulting in a lingering and velvety finish. Conversely, American oak's softer tannins lead to a smoother, more accessible mouthfeel, which appeals to many casual drinkers.

#### 3. Aging Potential

Wines aged in oak barrels benefit from micro-oxidation, helping to develop complexity over time. European oak, with its refined structure, often allows the wine to age gracefully, enhancing flavor integration, while American oak tends to produce fruitier wines that are meant to be enjoyed younger.

### Choosing the Right Oak

When selecting the ideal oak barrel for winemaking, consider the following factors:

- **Wine Variety:** Certain wines pair better with specific oak types – for example, a rich Chardonnay may thrive in American oak, whereas a robust Cabernet Sauvignon might be better suited for European oak.
- **Desired Flavor Profile:** Determine whether you want a sweeter, more fruit-based flavor or a complex, spicy profile.
- **Cost Consideration:** Depending on the budget, American oak might offer a more economical choice without sacrificing quality.

Oak barrels are essential in shaping the final product in winemaking. Each type presents unique influences that can enhance or transform the wine’s flavor and texture. By understanding the characteristics of different oak barrels, winemakers can make informed choices that align with their vision, ultimately producing exceptional wines that consumers will enjoy.

### Conclusion

Understanding the role of oak in winemaking is crucial for wine enthusiasts and producers alike. Oak barrels influence the flavor profile and texture of wines, introducing qualities such as vanilla, spice, and toastiness, which enhance the overall drinking experience. The choice of oak—American, French, or Hungarian—determines these nuances, as each type brings its own unique attributes to the wine. For example, American oak often imparts sweeter, more pronounced flavors, while French oak tends to emphasize subtlety and complexity.

Different barrel sizes and toasting levels further impact how wine interacts with the wood. Smaller barrels increase the wine's surface area contact, intensifying flavor integration, while the degree of toasting can unveil a spectrum of aromas and tastes. Understanding these factors allows winemakers to create more tailored and expressive wines, making oak not just a vessel but an essential tool in crafting the final product.

This relationship between oak and wine is not just technical; it deepens your appreciation for each sip. The complex interplay of flavor and texture creates memorable wine experiences and can change the way you perceive your favorite varietals. As you explore different wines, consider how the oak used in their production has shaped what you taste. Embracing this knowledge will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of winemaking. Whether you’re tasting a robust Cabernet Sauvignon or a delicate Chardonnay, the influence of oak remains a fundamental part of the story behind every bottle.

I hesitated to get the UH ring (any smartring) since I thought it would actually make me more neurotic about sleep. However, that’s not the case. Really does keep me focused on sleep. For example, sleeping in is more important to me now than doing a 6am workout tired.

They invited someone else I'm good friends with, Philip (38M) and haven't seen in a few weeks. My GF and I had been spending the day together in a spa, running errands and getting coffee.


Anyway, the night gets underway and were starting our board game. Nobody else but my girlfriend played before so she explained the rules. The board game was Ticket To Ride and decently complicated to explain, especially to a few drunk adults. The mood was rowdy and a bit childish, but as expected. I could see she was getting frustrated and annoyed with us, so during a smoke break I said to Philip to turn it down a notch and for us both to be more thoughtful of the situation.


Although that did help somewhat they both kept arguing and spoiling the mood, enough for everybody else to tell them to stop bickering. After that the mood was pretty terrible, but I feel it did recover somewhat. I concentrated on learning the game and paying attention to not rile Philip up more. Philip took it easier too and settled in a bit.


My GF was annoyed at people taking too long on their turns, rolled her eyes when were asking for rule clarifications or looked stuff up ourselves and to be honest was terrible at explaining the game in general. 


When everybody goes outside to celebrate the new year I get into a huge argument with my GF about how we're ganging up on her, how I'm not defending her and have been ignoring her all evening (by not sitting next to her). It gets pretty heated, but I tell her it's not my responsibility how people react to her behavior and I'm not here to police her or Philip. She says she does not enjoy our humor, and doesn't get the constant shooting jokes back and forth where we make fun of each other. I tell her to lighten up, it's a group situation and we all adapt to it and find a balance. Easier said than done I guess. She accuses me of not sticking up for her, and for only joking around with Philip and paying more attention to him than her.


We finish the game and what I can only describe as silence and everybody goes home.


She went home instead of to my place as planned and I'm pretty upset that New Years was soured by this and feel there's no reason for it to have gone this way.",68,1735795457.0,AmItheAsshole,38,0.87,False

Currently, we received our lease renewal letter. We had intentions to move across country to a new city for adventure and found a place that would be a short term lease for just three months. We thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try a new city without fully committing to a full year. Now that the lease renewal is here, reality is setting in and we are unsure what we should do. 

Our current apartment we have been in for three years. We built a beautiful home here with so many happy memories. It’s the home where all of our friends meet, has become a second home to many, where our creativity flourished, and where we have grown immensely as individuals and as a couple. 

On our street we are just steps away from coffee shops, restaurants, activities, parks, grocery stores, major tourist attractions. Everything we need is only a 2 minute walk away. We absolutely love it. 

The friend group we have took about 5 years to find. We always have people to have fun with, attend events and just be ourselves with. We are a family. 

We are thriving in every aspect of life and it all is so perfect. Friends, location, an apartment we love, family is only a short drive away, and we have built an incredible network throughout the city over the years. 

Moving was exciting but now that it’s setting in, we are starting to feel like we may be stepping away too soon from a perfect life. The only reason for the move was to take on a new adventure but maybe it’s not the right time. We are scared that we will ruin this amazing life we have by moving away and if we leave this apartment, we won’t get it back. 

This apartment is one that is very unique. The layout is not a typical white box, it has character. Ceilings go about 12-13ft bight, there are floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful, unobstructed view. The entry way is historic with a tiled stoop where we like to drink coffee on during the morning and have wine with music at night in the summer. I’m an artist and have created some of my best work here by being inspired by its charm. Our neighbors know us as the house with the bright and colorful decor and art. A house of fun as we always have the shades open to let in the best natural light all day long. It is a dream apartment - one that we imagined ourselves in when we were young but never thought would have. A one of a kind spot that can never be duplicated. 

We know this won’t last forever as we get older and our friends start to get married or have kids. But are we ruining such an amazing time in our life with everything we wanted by stepping away on a what if? Has anyone been in a position like this? It’s almost like we are recognizing an amazing time in our life and know these will be the days we long for when we are older and everything changes so why cut it short? Would we be making a mistake for a time we can never get back on a slight curiosity of what life in a new city could be like? Making friends in your 30s is not the same as in your 20s and

If we lose this apartment, it won’t be the same. The feeling of this home is unlike anything we have experienced. It’s a place that means so much more than a place to sleep. So much love and feelings are here. We just sat on the floor of our apartment and both realized that these moments are slipping away fast. We both started balling our eyes out and said we wished we could pause life here because it’s so perfect. The mourning of this place has started but we are holding on and unsure of what to do. 

Moving would be for growth and a new chapter but maybe this current chapter isn’t fully done yet. Does anyone ever know when a time ends and a new one begins? Would we make the mistake of not moving in fear of walking away from the best times of our life? 

The next place we would move to would only be for 3 months. But it is more about recognizing how good we have it with our current place. Not sure if this makes sense to anyone who is reading. But any advice would be so helpful. ",1,1735795369.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1hrmhtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_seekers/comments/1hrmhtg/vpns_for_mobile_devices_protect_your_privacy_on/,VPNs for Mobile Devices: Protect Your Privacy on the Go,"In today’s digital age, smartphones are essential for many aspects of our lives, from communication and entertainment to banking and shopping. However, mobile devices are also highly vulnerable to privacy and security risks. When connected to public Wi-Fi networks, sharing sensitive data, or even browsing personal accounts, your privacy is at risk. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an effective tool to protect your privacy, encrypt your data, and ensure a secure online experience while using your mobile device. In this post, we’ll explore the importance of using a VPN on mobile devices and how it helps safeguard your data and privacy on the go.

1. Why Use a VPN on Mobile Devices?

Mobile devices are constantly connected to the internet, which exposes them to several security and privacy risks. Here’s why using a VPN on your mobile device is crucial:

1.1. Protecting Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in cafes, airports, and hotels, are unsecured and vulnerable to hackers. Cybercriminals can easily access the data transmitted over these networks through man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially stealing sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data.

How a VPN helps: A VPN encrypts your internet traffic on public Wi-Fi, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it. This ensures that even if hackers are on the same network, they won’t be able to steal your data.

1.2. Bypassing Geo-Restrictions and Censorship

Many popular websites, streaming services, and apps are blocked or restricted based on your location. For example, some content on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer is only available in certain countries. Similarly, some regions block access to specific websites, such as social media or news outlets.

How a VPN helps: A VPN allows you to change your IP address and appear to be browsing from a different country, bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing content available in other regions. Whether you're traveling abroad or living in a country with internet censorship, a VPN helps you access a free and open internet.

1.3. Ensuring Privacy from Tracking

Many apps, websites, and advertisers track your online behavior, collecting data about your browsing habits, locations, and personal preferences. This information is often used for targeted advertising or sold to third parties, infringing on your privacy.

How a VPN helps: A VPN masks your real IP address and encrypts your traffic, preventing websites, advertisers, and even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from tracking your online activities. This gives you more anonymity and control over your data.

1.4. Securing Sensitive Transactions

Whether you’re shopping online, making mobile payments, or accessing banking apps, your financial data is at risk from cybercriminals. Mobile transactions can be especially vulnerable if you’re using public or unsecured networks.

How a VPN helps: A VPN secures your financial transactions by encrypting your connection, protecting sensitive information such as credit card details, bank account numbers, and login credentials from potential hackers.

2. Key Benefits of Using a VPN for Mobile Devices

A VPN provides several advantages for anyone using their mobile device for daily activities, including shopping, browsing, and communicating. Here are the key benefits of using a VPN on mobile devices:

2.1. Enhanced Security on Public Networks

Public Wi-Fi networks are a common attack vector for cybercriminals. A VPN encrypts your data, making it unreadable to anyone attempting to intercept it. This is especially important when you’re using free Wi-Fi in coffee shops, airports, or hotels.

2.2. Accessing Restricted Content

Certain content, such as TV shows, movies, or news websites, may be inaccessible based on your geographic location. With a VPN, you can connect to a server in a different region, allowing you to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is otherwise unavailable in your country.

2.3. Privacy from Third Parties

Many websites and apps track your browsing activity, collect personal information, and show you targeted ads. By masking your IP address and encrypting your traffic, a VPN helps prevent these entities from tracking your movements online, giving you more privacy while you browse or use apps on your mobile device.

2.4. Preventing ISP Throttling

Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) intentionally slow down your connection based on the type of traffic you’re using, such as streaming or gaming. A VPN can mask your internet activity, preventing your ISP from throttling your connection and allowing for faster speeds during these activities.

2.5. Avoiding Surveillance and Censorship

In countries with strict internet censorship, many websites, social media platforms, and news outlets are blocked. Additionally, governments or third parties may be monitoring your internet activity. A VPN helps you circumvent censorship and maintain your freedom of expression by enabling access to the open internet without fear of surveillance.

3. Choosing the Right VPN for Mobile Devices

When selecting a VPN for your mobile device, it’s important to choose one that meets your needs in terms of speed, security, and ease of use. Here are some factors to consider:

3.1. Security Features

Look for a VPN that offers strong encryption (AES-256-bit), secure protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec), and DNS leak protection to ensure your data is secure and private. Additionally, a kill switch feature is important to automatically disconnect your internet connection if the VPN drops, preventing exposure of your real IP address.

3.2. Speed and Performance

Choose a VPN that offers fast server speeds to minimize the impact on your mobile internet speed. If you’re streaming or gaming, speed is especially important to avoid buffering or lag. Make sure to select a VPN with high-performance servers to maintain smooth performance.

3.3. No-Logs Policy

A no-logs policy means the VPN provider does not store information about your online activities. This is essential for privacy because it ensures that your browsing history is not recorded and cannot be shared with third parties. Always choose a VPN provider that is transparent about its privacy practices.

3.4. Device Compatibility

Make sure the VPN supports mobile platforms, including both iOS and Android. The app should be user-friendly and easy to install, with intuitive controls to connect to servers quickly.

3.5. Server Locations

A large server network is ideal for bypassing geo-restrictions and finding a server close to your location for the best performance. Look for a VPN with servers in multiple countries, especially if you need to access content from different regions.

4. How to Set Up a VPN on Your Mobile Device

Setting up a VPN on your mobile device is typically straightforward. Here’s a general guide:

4.1. Download the VPN App

Go to the Google Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS).

Search for your VPN provider’s app (e.g., ExpressVPN, NordVPN, CyberGhost, or Surfshark).

Download and install the app on your device.

4.2. Log In

Open the app and log in with your VPN account credentials (you may need to sign up for a service if you haven’t already).

4.3. Connect to a Server

Choose a server location based on your needs (e.g., select a server from a country where content is not geo-restricted).

Tap Connect to initiate the VPN connection.

4.4. Start Browsing Securely

Once connected, your internet traffic will be encrypted and secure, and you can safely browse the web or access your favorite content without concerns about privacy or security.

5. Conclusion

Using a VPN on your mobile device is one of the most effective ways to protect your privacy, security, and freedom while using the internet on the go. Whether you're accessing sensitive data, browsing social media, or streaming your favorite shows, a VPN ensures your connection is encrypted, your activities are private, and your personal information stays safe.

With the right VPN, you can enjoy the internet securely and without limitations, no matter where you are. Whether you're using public Wi-Fi, streaming geo-restricted content, or simply protecting your personal data, a VPN is an essential tool for maintaining your privacy in the digital age.

Turin Legato V2. I've also got a Baratza Virtuoso calibrated to the finest grind setting. No matter what I do, my shots are sour. 
I have read all the guides, followed the directions, but can't figure out the issue. 

I have tried: 16 grams with the finest grind before the machine clogs. Anything finer clogs up and no liquid comes out. 
20 grams in the coarsest setting possible without losing all pressure and extracting in 15 seconds. Anything coarser just runs through and doesn't build pressure past 4 bar, and any more coffee doesn't fit. There are about 5 steps on the grinder between these two extremes and I've tried them all.

Just about every ratio and setting between these. 15 lb and 25 lb tamp pressure to try and hasten or slow extraction. Between 92 and 98 degrees C. I've tried 1:2 ratio, 1:3, even 1:4. At higher ratios the taste evens out slightly more, but still is noticably sour.

I don't have a proper WDT but use a paperclip to even everything out. I use a spring tamper and make sure everything is even. I've tried a medium local roast and thought that was the issue, so I bought some Intelligentsia El Diablo dark roast and had the same issue.

Notes: it seems sour, not bitter, no matter what. I know the machine and grinder aren't the best but it's what I've got. 

I let the machine warm up 20+ minutes, try a few blind shots to warm up, pressure builds, so that doesn't seem to be an issue.

Is there anything anyone can think of? I'm new to this and very lost.

My process for dialing in has been: 
Choose amount (started with 18 grams)
Find grind size that give roughly a 1:2 ratio. Very sour. 
Go to smallest grind size that doesn't clog. Still sour. 
Go down to 16 grams and smaller grind size. Still sour. 
Went the other way, coarser grind, and more coffee to get 1:2 ratio. Still sour. 
Tried all the above for 1:3, 1:4 ratio.

My read of her is that she's interested - we've been out quite a bit, but I'm baffled why she doesn't want to spend more time together (i've told her quite clearly that I enjoy her company). This is only concerning insofar as I do enjoy spending quality time with a partner, and consider it crucial for any good, long-term relationship.

Several points to note:

1. No, we're not exclusively dating
2. No, we've not been physically intimate - this is in an asia context where its low-touch etc so while it's probably a bit unusual, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
3. She's had prior relationships before, of unknown duration - so she surely must have been out and about before.
4. I don't think she's seeing anyone else (her profession is packed, and time doesn't allow for it), but I could be wrong. I'm not seeing anyone else as it is for what its worth.

Some possible responses:

1. I've considered raising this up, and communicating it (I mean I even told her I enjoy spending time, which is as gentle a way you could let someone know without her seeming difficult)- maybe I should be more forward, explicit?
2. Quality time simply isn't one of her love language, but mine, and she's just blissfully ignorant - maybe I should communicate that.
3. We're not officially dating, so of course she doesn't owe me any time - she's keen on living a full, rich life and has plenty outside hobbies to engage her (sports, friends, travels etc) - broach the topic of exclusivity (which to be fair, is on my mind)

I forwarded the email to my roomies (a couple, which in hindsight was a horrible idea) and flew home for two weeks for the holidays. The night I flew home they both texted me in the GC saying they were so frustrated I didn't send it earlier and they were super annoyed and upset. I honestly didn't think I did anything wrong and responded that they should reach out to the property company to be put on the email chain and they said they did months ago but to no avail.

I just got back and two hours later they call me into the living room and are saying I don't take any accountability and are bringing up issues that happened BEFORE they even moved in!!! I am in shock and try to defend myself, and I am getting ganged up on bc they are a couple. After a while I just start apologizing and they said that me saying ""I am sorry for that and sorry you feel that way"" isn't taking responsibility and isn't a proper apology. I just apologized multiple times because I still have 6 months left of the lease and I don't want to be a prisoner in my own home.

THEN, the male counterpart of the couple gets out his phone and starts to read a LIST of everything I do wrong. They are super clean, and so am I, but they are super anal about it. He said I leave coffee grinds out by counter that he has to sweep up and that I leave some jam on the counter (I have not). I am never even at the house really and if I am, I'm in my room.

I am completely overwhelmed at this point, I just got home, and I just start nodding my head and agreeing because I am so tired and discouraged and genuinely scared of how I am going to make it to the summer.

The best part? I work with one of them so I get literally no down time away from them hahaha RIP.

I am just wondering what people who are in similar situations are doing to survive and if anyone has any funny roommate stories to cheer me up for the next few months.

TLDR: Roommates ambushed me and read off a list of everything I am messing up in a very nitpicky manner.",1,1735794848.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

I have a single ingredient ditto, level 8 slowpoke with 2nd and 3rd ingredient tails, and level 13 slowbro with 2nd slot only. but only the slowpoke has tails in the second ingredient slot. But who would I be most on the lookout for and how to get them asap? 

What are my best options for large leeks? I only have a diglett and dugtrio (same levels as above) with it in the 2nd slot but my highest level Pokemon are currently in the mid-high teens and those are only that high because they’re my go to team. 

I’m thinking ditto with a second slowpoke tail slot is the best way, but I’m unsure and that also takes a lot of luck I’m guessing. But out of what I have and what has the best odds, how should I go about it as quickly as possible?

If it helps: I am semi pay to win :/ I’ve only been playing ~6? weeks, so I also only have 4? island unlocked and of course spending the next 2 on Greengrass. Also, I love ingredient skill mons and plan on specializing mostly in those. But of course also all the ones I loved when I was younger and the newer ones I like will be raised :)

Bonus question- how rare are good camp tickets? I had 3, used one for Christmas and plan on using one for New Year’s week 2. How often are (good) events? Lastly, when can I upgrade my pot past 33? I didn’t realize there’d be a cap on it :/

- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of coffee, drawing, fantasy books, live music, working out daily, and silly questions like this

Over the years, I've heard some people, both in person and online, say that my tite looks a little unique haha. On the other hand, though, some have also seemed not to really notice. 

So now, I'm curious to hear what other people think, to see how ""different"" it really is, if at all. I'm especially interested in honest opinions, since it can be hard to tell whether someone in person is being more kind because they know me, or if someone online is being more harsh because it's anonymous. I think it would be interesting to hear someone else's opinion about my D's appearance. 

ALSO: I probably won't respond to people with blank profiles, unless you can send a pic with verification (like your username and the date written on a piece of paper).

1hrmcut,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1hrmcut/melbourne_trip_itinerary_and_recommendations/,Melbourne trip itinerary and recommendations,"Hi all!

I’ve got a trip coming up to Melbourne from Sydney and would appreciate getting some thoughts on my rough itinerary from those more knowledgable and experienced. Open to any feedback and recommendations that I’ve missed that you think are worth checking out.

Also worth mentioning I visited once before back in summer 2017 with family and did most of the usual tourist attractions. Having said that there are some places (ACMI for example) that I’m planning to visit again.

My approach is to basically segment each day into Morning/Afternoon/Evening and do just 1 thing in each section, not counting eating a meal. Bonus if it’s all located in roughly the same area for convenience (and less time spent travelling)

# Details

4 night stay 

**Departing** \- Saturday 4th January 

* SYD-MELB flight 9:00am - 10:35am

**Returning** \- Wednesday 8th January

* MELB-SYD flight 7:00pm - 8:25pm 

I’ll be staying in the Docklands on the northern side of the water within walking distance to a tram stop. Don’t mind taking taxi/uber if that’s more convenient for a specific destination.

# Current itinerary

**Saturday (Day 1)**

Check in, wander around CBD, check out laneways and all that.

Probably grab lunch in Chinatown.

Maybe see Carlton Gardens.

Get to AAMI park for Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney kick off at 7:35pm. After the match I'll probably turn in early but might grab something quick to eat first.



**Sunday (Day 2)**

Would like to check out St Kilda beach and that general area as I've heard there’s some cool street markets. 

Don’t know if I’ll stay long enough to see the penguins (assuming it’s not closed off to visitors) as apparently they rock up at sunset like the little gangstas they are.

But if there’s enough to do and see for an entire day in that area then great, more of a chance to see the penguins (they're the selling point of the trip, forget the coffee /s)



**Monday (Day 3)**

Could alternatively do the beach on this day with the benefit of it likely being less crowded.

Tossing up between spending the morning plus having brunch at Queen Victoria Market or Prahran Market. The latter is more out the way but anecdotally I’ve heard it’s better.

There’s an exhibition at ACMI which I’d like to check out. So far I'm unable to get an answer on how long it usually takes to finish but will put aside at least 2hrs or so.



**Tuesday (Day 4)**

Got tickets to the tennis which starts at 4pm, not sure what to do before that. 

This day needs something for the morning/early afternoon section so recommendations are appreciated :) 



**Wednesday (Day 5)**

Hotel check out time at 10am. Decent chunk of time before return flight at 7pm. 

Maybe I could check out Fitzroy, Brunswick etc. and take my time heading back to the airport if that's practical?

# Possible other activities:

**NGV** \- did it during last trip but felt rushed and couldn’t really enjoy it so wouldn’t mind to see it again.

**Skydeck** \- also done during last trip but wouldn’t mind checking it out at night this time. Downside is it’s a fair bit of waiting for an ultimately brief experience.

Is there anything worth checking out in the **Docklands**? Since that’s where I’m staying it’d be good to find something in that area.

Is the **State Library** worth checking out? Maybe a guided tour?



Also bit of a tangent but during the last trip we went to an Italian place in South Melbourne which I’m pretty sure was called ‘Old Mates Pizza and Pasta’. Looks like it’s closed down but is there a slim chance they’ve moved/operating under a different name? I only ask because I remember the chicken parmi/parma/parmo/ being glorious.

Thank you for taking the time to read this I know it’s a lot, much appreciated :)

From websites tracking your browsing habits to hackers attempting to steal personal data, protecting your privacy online is more crucial than ever. One of the most effective tools for safeguarding your online privacy is a VPN (Virtual Private Network)In today’s interconnected world, online privacy is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. From websites tracking your browsing habits to hackers attempting to steal personal data, protecting your privacy online is more crucial than ever. One of the most effective tools for safeguarding your online privacy is a VPN (Virtual Private Network). A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, hides your IP address, and helps you maintain anonymity while browsing the web. In this post, we’ll explore why VPNs are essential for online privacy, how they work, and the key benefits they offer.

1. What is a VPN and How Does It Protect Your Privacy?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that routes your internet traffic through a secure, remote server, thereby masking your real IP address and encrypting your internet connection. By doing so, a VPN makes it much harder for third parties—such as your ISP (Internet Service Provider), advertisers, or even hackers—to monitor your online activity.

Here’s how a VPN protects your privacy:

Hides your IP address: Your IP address reveals information about your physical location and can be used to track your online activities. A VPN replaces your real IP address with one from its own server, making it difficult for anyone to trace your actions back to you.

Encrypts your data: VPNs encrypt your internet traffic using strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256-bit encryption), which makes it unreadable to anyone who intercepts it, including hackers or government authorities.

2. Why is Online Privacy Important?

In an increasingly digital world, much of our personal information is stored and transmitted online, making us vulnerable to privacy breaches. Here are some key reasons why online privacy is essential:

2.1. Protection from Hackers

Public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., those in coffee shops, airports, or hotels) are often unsecured, making them prime targets for man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers intercept data being transmitted between your device and websites. Using a VPN on these networks encrypts your traffic, preventing hackers from stealing sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers.

2.2. Preventing Data Tracking

Many websites and advertisers track your online behavior using cookies and other tracking technologies. This allows them to build profiles based on your browsing habits and show you targeted ads. A VPN blocks tracking by masking your IP address, preventing websites and advertisers from collecting personal information about you.

2.3. Guarding Against Identity Theft

Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal data, such as your social security number, banking details, or credit card information. A VPN protects your sensitive information by encrypting your internet traffic, reducing the risk of falling victim to such attacks.

2.4. Avoiding Government Surveillance

In many countries, governments monitor internet traffic to track citizens' activities or censor content. A VPN enables you to browse freely without the fear of being watched or monitored by government agencies, thus maintaining your freedom of expression and privacy.

3. Key Benefits of Using a VPN for Online Privacy

A VPN is one of the best tools you can use to protect your online privacy. Here are some of the major benefits it offers:

3.1. Enhanced Anonymity

By masking your real IP address, a VPN makes it much harder for websites, advertisers, or anyone else to identify you. This is especially useful if you want to keep your browsing habits private and prevent your online activities from being tracked.

3.2. Data Encryption

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic using strong encryption protocols, ensuring that even if someone manages to intercept your data, they won’t be able to read it. This encryption is essential when using unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

3.3. Bypassing Geo-Restrictions

Many streaming platforms and websites restrict access to content based on your geographic location. With a VPN, you can bypass geo-restrictions by connecting to a server in a different country, giving you access to content that may be blocked in your region.

3.4. Securing Your Internet Connection on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks are convenient but can also be dangerous, as they are often unencrypted and susceptible to security risks. Using a VPN when connected to public Wi-Fi ensures that your data is encrypted and protected from potential attacks.

3.5. Preventing Bandwidth Throttling

Some ISPs intentionally slow down your internet connection based on the type of activity you’re doing, such as streaming or gaming. A VPN prevents your ISP from seeing what you’re doing online, allowing you to bypass throttling and enjoy faster internet speeds.

4. How VPNs Help in Protecting Sensitive Information

Whether you’re making an online purchase, logging into a bank account, or accessing medical records, protecting sensitive information is a top priority. Here’s how a VPN can help:

4.1. Secure Financial Transactions

When making purchases online or handling sensitive banking information, it’s essential to ensure your data is secure. A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing anyone from intercepting and stealing your payment details.

4.2. Protecting Personal Data

Personal data, such as email addresses, social media accounts, and private messages, are vulnerable to being accessed by third parties. A VPN ensures that your personal data remains secure and protected by encryption.

5. VPN Limitations and Considerations

While VPNs provide excellent protection for online privacy, there are a few things to keep in mind:

5.1. VPN Speed

Since a VPN routes your traffic through a remote server and encrypts your data, it can sometimes result in slower internet speeds. However, this slowdown can often be minimized by choosing a high-quality VPN service with fast servers and optimized protocols.

5.2. Trusting Your VPN Provider

Not all VPN providers are trustworthy. Some may log your data or even sell it to third parties. It’s important to choose a VPN provider that has a strict no-logs policy and is transparent about its privacy practices.

5.3. VPN Blocking

Some websites and streaming services actively block VPN traffic. This is particularly common with services like Netflix or BBC iPlayer, which restrict content based on geographic locations. While some VPNs can bypass these blocks, others may not be effective in accessing these services.

6. Conclusion

In an era where online privacy is constantly at risk, VPNs offer a reliable and effective way to protect your personal information and ensure your freedom on the internet. By encrypting your connection, masking your IP address, and preventing data tracking, a VPN is one of the most important tools for anyone looking to maintain their online privacy and security.

Using a VPN helps protect sensitive data, prevents identity theft, and allows you to access a free and open internet without fear of censorship or surveillance. Whether you're using public Wi-Fi, streaming content, or simply browsing, a VPN ensures that your online activity stays private.

I posted a couple of times about the traumatic event that I went through with LO choking and the subsequent extreme anxiety and intrusive thoughts that came with it.

Today LO is 10 weeks, she is growing quickly and every passing day gives me more reassurance that she will be okay.

The choking event happened again, this time it was at night while she was sleeping,  I was also asleep and woke up to her grunting before she puked then choked, I'm pretty convinced now that it's a combination of reflux and gagging and her trying to deal with it as much as she is physically capable of, however this time I did not panic (too much) I turned her on her stomach, a few back blows, sucking out the mucus/milk from nose and mouth, blowing air in her face and the episode was soon over. I did stay up for a  week after watching her at night to make sure it didn't happen again.

One thing to add is my baby refused to sleep on her back  in a bassinet/cot/crib or any flat surface so we are holding her most of the time. When the second incident happened I was starting to get her used to sleeping in the next to me cot. But after that, we went back to chest sleeping and doing it in shifts. This felt like a drawback and it triggered another round of frustration, anxiety and intrusive thoughts.

Then my beloved grandpa passed away the day after Christmas. We had to go to the funeral (due to my culture and guilt I didn't skip it). We went, there was no one to watch her (as my mom is the only one I currently trust to leave her alone with) so we took her with us and gave very clear and loud instructions to other family members to keep their distance and no touching the baby. Safe to say no one listened or respected that so it was an  incredibly stressful day. 

She got sick a few days ago, so did I, and although it's ripping my heart in half to see her coughing and her nose congested, things are somehow better? Caring for a sick infant is hard but we're doing it! And we're doing it alone with no support system since my mom is currently staying with my devastated grandma. I feel that I am very in tuned to her needs and cues and it's incredibly comforting and empowering.

It might be my perspective of things that shifted, that I am trusting myself and my instincts which is allowing me to better care for her. Also I am getting incredible support from my husband who has basically been a saint in all of this despite having gone back to work. We managed to find an adequate schedule that actually works. He's been taking care of basically most house related chores and taking shifts with the baby. 

I got a lot of advice on the first and second post I made which were extremely helpful! And I have implemented a great deal of them, it certainly gave me some peace of mind and also proved very helpful when dealing with this sickness like the owlet sock and nose sucker (I have 3 now!).

Also breastfeeding doesn't feel like torture anymore and baby girl is latching so well all on her own. I never thought this would be possible.

Don't get me wrong I'm still in the trenches, with sleepless nights and exhausting days but I don't feel that despair anymore and I allowed myself a cup of coffee during the midnight shift which has been soooo helpful for staying up and feeling in control. 

I love my baby girl, despite being sick and uncomfortable, she's easy to calm and soothe.  And even though I'm annoying her with saline drops up the nose and snot sucking, she smiles and coos afterward. It's not the end of the tunnel yet but I truly feel that we're getting there!

This past weekend, we attended a friend's wedding. There was a (again, relevant info) fairly heavy young woman at our table who was drinking heavily, and was flirting very aggressively with my husband throughout the evening. I found out later that she's a cousin of the bride. He was very polite, but eventually started rebuffing her with decreasingly gentle hints, and told her that he was gay and that his husband was sitting right next to him.

A bit later, some tables were cleared and dancing began, which led us to believe that we were off the hook. The woman who had been bothering us was dancing with another guy, so we sat at the edge of the improvised dance floor and watched. After a while, however, she had disentangled from her dance partner and was dancing near us with a couple of female friends. Right as a song was ending, she leaned backward in an attempted flourish of sorts and ""tripped"" and ended up right in my husband's lap.

As I mentioned earlier, his bones are not up to supporting a \~200 lb weight suddenly dropping on him, and she ended up breaking both of his femurs and one of his ribs. It was a disaster -- we had to call an ambulance, he needed surgery on his right leg, he had to stay in the hospital for 4 nights, and he's going to be stuck in bed for a good long while. We do have decent health insurance, but it's looking like we can expect to pay \~$3000 out of pocket for the healthcare he received. Honestly, we don't have that kind of money lying around.

Our friend who got married has been in touch and was extremely apologetic about the situation. He and his new wife were absolutely not at fault, and I'd like to drag them through the mud as little as possible. I am, however, wondering if it is possible to sue the cousin at fault for the medical bills we now owe. After an evening of aggressive flirting, I frankly don't believe that she came over to us and then happened to fall exactly in my husband's lap purely by accident, but I don't have any proof that it was intentional. I'm certain that she didn't have any malicious intent, and that she had no idea that she was going to hurt him so badly by plopping herself on him the way she did. Even if it was purely a drunken stumble, does she bear any liability for the injuries she caused, even if they were unintentional?

Neither of us have contacted her at all since the wedding -- we'd never met beforehand, and I don't know quite how to casually ask a stranger for thousands of dollars. Based on her behavior at the wedding (the actions above, plus the fact that she peaced out as soon as it became apparent that she'd really hurt my husband, and she didn't get in touch again) I suspect that she's not going to be super willing to pitch in for medical expenses. Do we have any kind of case against her? Is it worth hiring a lawyer, or is that just going to add to the pit of debt that this wedding has put us into?

>Most wedding venues will require the purchase of wedding insurance which could cover the costs of injuries to guests.  I would ask the bride and groom to see if they have a policy and if it would cover injuries; if there is coverage then the insurance company may either cover the medical expenses or the attorney fees to sue the cousin. 

**OOP**

>>That's a great point and not something I'd thought of. I'll ask the groom about it, but probably won't get a definitive answer until they get back from their honeymoon after the New Year.

**CasCoco**

>>>You can also ask the venue if they require the insurance(then you get the quick answer), with the venue my wedding was held at we couldn’t finalize everything until I had the insurance purchased and sent them a copy. This way at least you know if the bride and groom SHOULD have it

>>If she did it on purpose, that's battery.

>>If she did it on accident, that's negligence.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/wt0GKN6TGL)  **Jan 11, 2019**

I just wanted to post to provide an update to my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a7v51t/suing_for_medical_expenses_after_disaster_wedding/. First off, thank you everyone for providing really helpful input -- my husband and I had pretty much just planned to pay the bills ourselves until we read through everyone's comments.

My husband got in touch with a personal injury lawyer shortly after I made the original post, and he said that she echoed a lot of the advice we saw on here (shoutout to u/lawgeek for introducing me to the term ""eggshell plaintiff"", which was apparently the phrase of the hour when they talked). She said that he would almost certainly win a case against the drunk cousin, possibly for quite a substantial payout once lost wages and pain and suffering were taken into account. She added, however, that recovery could be a real issue, and the suit might not be worth pursuing if we didn't think the cousin would actually pay up. She said that he also could have a case under Minnesota's dram shop law against the bride and groom or (more likely) the bartending service they hired, but he’d likely get a much smaller settlement because of comparative fault laws. I got the name of the bartending service, and they definitely have liquor liability coverage.

I learned from the groom that the cousin is a bit of a train wreck in terms of fiscal responsibility, and that she's quite unlikely to be willing or able to pay any kind of settlement. So for now my husband's lawyer is helping him figure out how to bring a case against the bartenders. As I mentioned, it's unlikely that we'd get the full settlement (especially if he settles out of court, which I think he'd like to do if possible), but that's completely fine because the numbers she was citing were crazy high once pain and suffering, etc. were brought into play. Even a quite small fraction, if we were able to recover it, would help a lot.

As an aside, the drunk cousin apparently found out that we were considering suing her, because she found my husband on facebook and sent him a rather incoherent message about how the whole situation wasn't her fault because she couldn't have known he had OI, and in fact was HIS fault for not telling her. I guess she thinks he should just wear a sign at all times that says ""I have brittle bones, please do not sit on me"". I thought he should reply ""Eggshell plaintiff, bitch!"" but maturity won out at the end of the day and he didn't respond at all.

Otherwise, his fractures are healing well, which is a huge relief, and he's a lot more comfortable than he was the last time I posted. It's a little bit of a bummer that the cousin isn't going to be held accountable for her actions, but at least it's looking likely that we won't be on the hook for the bills we had to pay. Thanks again for the help, LA!

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**OOP Appeared on BoLA and replied there**

**Is the lawyer aware of the Facebook messages?**

>Yes, my husband brought it up the last time they spoke. This is second-hand (I didn't speak to her myself) so I might be mixing up some details, but my impression is that it doesn't matter all that much. Whether or not it was intentional, he has a valid tort against her. If it was unintentional, it would be negligence, if it's intentional it would be... something else.

>If he decided to sue her, it would probably be a relevant piece of evidence, but it still doesn't solve the problem that she's very unlikely to pay whatever the court decides she owes him.

**Is the cousin telling the truth about not heing able to pay the judgement?**

>I don’t have any proof beyond what the groom said, but he’s a very close friend and I really don’t think he’d lie about it. Also, he and the bride did offer to cover half of my husband’s medical expenses themselves, which was very kind but we didn’t feel comfortable accepting (especially after they’d just spent most of their savings on their wedding and honeymoon).

>The cousin herself doesn’t have any assets beyond her car, which I can’t imagine is worth much. I believe her parents are middle class/lower middle class, so there’s a good chance that they’d just end up paying whatever they could from their retirement savings or something, but that also seems pretty shitty and unfair.

**Can one of the insured parties sue the cousin?**

>Due to comparative fault laws in Minnesota, I think the answer is no. If we sued the bartenders and the court found them liable, they’d only have to pay the percent of the total damages they’re liable for. So if they were 20% responsible and the cousin was 80% responsible, they’d only have to pay 20% of total damages.

[Presumably final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/euh2Aubwwg)  **Feb 13, 2019**

Now that things have settled down a little, I thought I'd provide an update to my previous posts ([original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a7v51t/suing_for_medical_expenses_after_disaster_wedding/) and [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aex9cr/update_suing_for_medical_expenses_after_disaster/)) about the most unpleasant wedding I've ever attended.

Long story short, we didn't end up suing anyone. The woman who was responsible was unlikely to be willing or able to pay for any real  damages, and Minnesota apparently has fairly strict wage garnishment laws which would prevent us from recouping even legal costs for the  foreseeable future. We did also look into suing the company that provided bartending services for the wedding, but ultimately dropped that as well for two reasons. Firstly, there's a good chance that we'd lose the case and would then be out legal costs as well as medical expenses, and secondly it seemed that even if we did win, someone who really wasn't to blame would likely be fired.

There is good news though! As someone suggested on the original thread, the couple did have wedding insurance that covered up to $5000 in expenses for injuries to guests, which did not require establishing fault. So we were actually able to get pretty much everything paid for with that  without going through the hassle of a law suit. It definitely wasn't the kind of payout that a personal injury suit can bring, but we hadn't really been looking to profit from whole situation anyway so it turned out fine.

Other than the highly unpleasant individual who caused the whole situation, everyone involved has been really wonderful. My husband called the hospital's billing department, and they were very accommodating about deferring payment and reducing costs that they had control over (intimate knowledge of the hospital's inner workings is one of the major perks of OI, along with the punch card that gets you your 10th surgery free). Also, the lawyer didn't end up charging us for anything, despite the fact that she spent three hours meeting with my husband and presumably some extra billable time on top of that. The bride and groom have also been very helpful with the insurance and legal information, and gracious about their wedding reception going south in such a spectacular manner. I do really wish  that there had been some kind of consequences for the cousin beyond public shaming, but I'll just have to hope that every one of her Starbucks orders is slightly wrong for the rest of her life.

tl;dr:  Insurance ended up paying for expenses, drunk cousin had no financial  consequences but has to live with a guilty conscience, which is a much  worse punishment in the end (who am I kidding, I really wish it had made sense to sue her sorry ass for all she's worth)

EDIT: Someone messaged me informing me I posted from the wrong account. Oops. I can't comment from the original account because this thread is locked, but if there's a BOLA post or something I can post there. I need more coffee.

What M4 should I buy ?,"I work as a Software Engineer. Had been a Mac user since 2011, both professionally and personally. Never used Windows in this time, and Linux is just it's own challenges so decided to prefer to stay away from it.

Been suffering a down-time since late 2022, and 2024 had been ever so terrible. Spilled coffee and caused liquid-damage to my ""personal 2021 16 inch M1-Pro"" two weeks ago, just prior to the holidays, so there's that too !! Obviously, buying a new M4 may be, just may be, a better alternative to repairing a 2021 M1-Pro ?

Essentially, as an Android Engineer, I anticipate high intensity usage as follows, occassionally, for interviews and such - 

* USB-C monitor, secondary-display, aside from the mac built-in screen.
* A Video-call software - Zoom, MS Teams, Skype, Webex, almost always just one at-a-time.
* Logitech Camera mounted on the USB-C secondary monitor
* Screen-share, almost always likely.
* A code-pair website in Safari / Mozilla Firefox browser
* Either IntelliJ Idea or Android Studio, or possibly both, either foregrounded ( Android Code specific interviews ) or backgrounded ( yes, I rely on smart-editor features occassionally as needed, as quickly as possible, during online tests and interviews )
* Obviously, the speakers and microphone audio and related processing.

Aside from the above high-intensity remote video interviews usage, I don't intend to use my personal device for any professional enterprise software code for prolonged periods of time.

I ask specifically because way-back in early 2021 I made the worst uninformed purchase of a Quad-Core i5 2 GHz and 16 GB RAM, and some remote video-interviews went terribly janky. Obviously, had to upgrade to a M1-Pro, but now I am constrained on budget.

So - what M4 should I buy within my current budget constraints for the above occassionally high-intensity usage for remote video-interviews ?

1. The base 14-inch M4 with 10-Core CPU, 10-Core GPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, priced at \~$1600. This one is too basic in it's tech-specs, so I am equally suspicious this may be only as efficient as the core-i5 I had described above ?
2. The base 14-inch M4-Pro with 12-Core CPU, 16-Core GPU, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD, priced at \~$2000. An M4-Pro may not even be necessary, if the base M4 itself were adequate ?
3. The damaged M1-Pro was a 16-inch screen device, therefore, also considering the base 16-inch M4-Pro with 14-Core CPU, 20-Core GPU, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD, priced at \~$2500, but then a 16-inch may be too much for a personal device, nevertheless, the tech-specs may be the only one suitable for the occassional high-intensity remote video-interviews ?
4. I definitely don't think I'd need a M4-Max for personal use.

He also makes a lot less than me, around half my salary.

The issue is that he sometimes will ask me to pay or buy him gifts back. I don’t think it’s in a scammy or red flag kind of way, but it does put me off a little.

Some examples:
For his birthday, I took him out to eat at some pretty expensive places as we both enjoy fine dining. I also offered to take him out shopping so he could pick out a gift, since he’s been wanting a new coat. He told me it was fine and he’d buy one himself. But then a couple weeks later he messages me asking if I was still planning to buy him one. It felt rude to say no so I ended up buying it for him.

He wanted some decor for his room and asked me if I wanted to pick something out. He said I could choose something and buy it as a housewarming gift (even though I already gave him one).

I usually pay for our more expensive meals, but even for casual meals I often pay for more than 50% of the bill, since he has less disposable income. Every now and then he’ll pay for a meal though. But then he’ll follow it up with, “Oh do you want to pay for my coffee/dessert later?” 

I think my issue with it isn’t that he’s using me for my money, but that it’s weird to ask somebody to buy or pay for something unless they offer. How can I approach this/talk to him about this? I’m not sure if I just need to be more understanding in light of our financial situations.

Added context: We’ve been dating for 3 years and met in college when I had nowhere near this much money, so he def didn’t start dating for financial reasons. He also does buy me expensive gifts every couple months — scarves, shoes, sweaters, the Dyson airwrap, etc, which is why I don’t fully believe he’s using me for my money.",3,1735793744.0,relationship_advice,15,1.0,False

For reference, this is our first time staying in an all inclusive. Overall, we wouldn't recommend this property if you're looking for a good beach/food vacation.

* Drinks: most of the cocktails were mediocre and on the weaker side. The cocktail bar off the main lobby area was best and I enjoyed the frozen drinks by the pool. The wine was pretty much undrinkable, a yellowtail or barefoot would've been much better. 
* Food: 
   * Overall: Cuts of meat/fish were high quality but the shrimp and shellfish was not. Flavor and spice were sometimes lacking. Ask for hot sauce if you want things spicy. We were underwhelmed by the food as a whole. 
   * Spice Buffet: The variety was good, but this was pretty standard buffet food, nothing outstanding. They did do made-to-order omelets, burgers, and a few other things.
   * Asiana: This was probably our favorite restaurant. The apps we ordered were just okay but sea bass and salmon were really good and the tempura ice cream was great.
   * Maria Petrona: We've had much better Mexican food in a small U.S. metro. Tres leches was delicious. 
   * Kalamata: Better than expected based on other reviews. Buffet appetizers were good, entrees were also good except the pasta with chicken parm was cold. Desserts were terrible.
   * Pelicanos (dinner): Pass on the tuna ceviche. Everything else we had was decent.
   * Room service (breakfast): Not super quick, but some of the best food we had at the resort.
   * Aromas Cafe: We liked everything, quick stop for croissants and coffee. Gelato was more icy than creamy.
   * Chefs table: We thought it was worthwhile with the diamond member discount. Food was all good, definitely upscale, and they had decent house wine. 
* Pool area: We didn't have any issues trying to get chairs but they do run out. Some people were frustrated that there were too many empty cabanas right up against the pools and not enough lounge chairs. The pools were nice and water was a good temperature.
* Beach area: The beach was small and the ocean wasn't great for swimming in, and occasionally smelly. There were a lot of open lounge chairs on the beach. You could walk up the beach a bit to a public beach with a better swimming area but it was pretty crowded. The beach was only good for a short walk because it ends in both directions.
* Entertainment: We enjoyed the foam party and silent disco. There was a lot of cool entertainment in the lobby each night and it was usually packed until 11pm when everything pretty much shuts down and food/drink are cut off. 
* Rooms: As expected, but mini bar was lacking - only had two beers, some sodas, and bottled water.  The balcony and hammock were nice. 
* Playa Del Carmen town: 5th ave had a ton of shops and restaurants and felt very safe. We heard good things about restaurants in town but we only ate at the resort. There are tons of day trips and things to do like snorkelling, cenotes, Cozumel, and ruins. The tours we looked at were more expensive at the resort compared to other operators.

The resort was beautiful and the service was great. We weren't really sure what to do for tipping and were inconsistent since we weren't always carrying cash, but we usually tipped servers, bartenders, and housekeeping with pesos. We both got GI issues after a few days, but can't say for sure if that was from the resort or from being in Tulum prior. 

If we were to visit Playa Del Carmen again we wouldn't do all inclusive because we'd rather try local restaurants and there are better beaches on the north side of town. ",6,1735793315.0,Hilton,0,1.0,False

I have a difficult relationship with my parents so I have a mother-in-law from my previous relationship whom I visit regularly since a year or 4. She is like a mother to me and she is nice and we have a good relationship I guess.

The thing is: she smokes inside, a LOT. Last time I visited for 3 days and and when I went home I was so stuffy, like I wasn't breathing comfortably. I never smoke, because of how extremely bad smoking is for your health, but with all HER smoking it's like I'm smoking but without the benefits (considering the act of smoking a cigarette is nice) due to 2nd hand smoke. I get so angry while I'm thinking about it, a cigarette while we talk.. then we drink coffee and another cigarette.... before lunch a cigarrete, after lunch a cigarrette... while we cook dinner she goes to sit down for a cigarette.. after dinner multiple cigarettes... in the evening we sit and talk a lot and constantly cigarettes... \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

When I came back home I was frustrated for hours. She has a lot on her mind right now so she said she is not going to quit smoking, maybe in like 2 years or something, but I just don't want this for my health...

To lower the damage to MY health, I'm considering asking her to NOT smoke when I visit her, like the whole time I'm there, also not when she is already awake and downstairs and I'm not yet. The third hand smoke is already bad enough and she could smoke outside but I just know she can't keep that up because it rains a lot, gets dark quickly, she is old, and no way she could cram 20 cigarettes in day the daytime. If she says no, I might not visit anymore for a while... maybe if my mental health is better and I won't get scared over health issues.

Would I be the asshole if I did this? Asking her to not smoke while I'm there/ only outside and otherwise not going there anymore? She might say ''all the things I've done for you and you ask me not to smoke in my own house''.  ''what if I only smoke 10 inside""' ''you are exaggerating, 2nd hand smoke is not that bad''. The thoughts of such a conversation make me extremely pissed, I feel like she doesn't care it's bad for my health....

I scheduled an appointment a couple months after this and to my surprise he had sold his practice and retired the week before so I had someone I’ve never met doing a crown on me (which I had never had… cue anxiety). The new dentist said he could save me from a crown and instead did a filling.

But the truth is, joy often whispers rather than shouts. It appears unexpectedly, filling our hearts and souls in quiet moments. A smile, a laugh, a flash of gratitude, or even a jolt of ecstasy—all gifts of joy that often vanish as quickly as they come, leaving only their memory behind.

As I look back, I see how brief these moments can be. Yet, I also see how they’ve become more frequent, sparked by the simplest pleasures:

A warm coffee on a rainy day.

The satisfying ending of a beautifully written story.

A friend’s embrace that lingers just a little longer.

The head tilt and eager eyes of a dog waiting for a ball.

The sound of my children’s laughter.

The touch of another’s skin against mine.


These moments, so small yet so profound, are the gifts of joy I’ve been blessed with this past year. My wish for you as we step into 2025 is this: may you find these sparks of joy in your everyday life. May they fill your heart and remind you of the beauty that exists in the simplest of moments.

In this time my boss has been extremely volatile and I would even go as far as saying she is a bully. She regularly throws what I call tantrums where she will throw things across the room and yell at people for no reason. Example being a girl not giving her a free coffee just because she should know we work in the same building. 

When I started she tried to make me dislike the slowest member of our team. To which some criticism is valid but she would quite often make things up about him and breaking company policy. 

Recently I have been her target where I get passive aggressive emails about everything I didn’t do on the closing shift even though I did not have time. She never asks why she just jumps to conclusions. I’m not a cocky person but I know I’m a good worker and I don’t piss around at work so I found these daily emails hard to receive. She leaves early everyday and will tell me not to stress and just do as much as I can but in the morning it’s a different story. 

She recently accused me of damaging something and just pretending it didn’t happen, she contacted me on my day off with the accusations without even asking the other staff. My responses were blunt because I’m at my wits end, I wasn’t rude I just gave the same energy back. She said I should’ve delt with it even though I didn’t have time and genuinely did not see the damage. So my response was “there aren’t enough hours in the day unless you want to pay me overtime”. She did not respond but did complain to other staff members saying I’m an ungrateful bitch with a bad attitude along with unnecessary things about my appearance (she allegedly called me an ugly fat bitch). She then changed my roster to be working 8 consecutive days in a row which she preaches no one should work more than 5. She also told my co worker that I’m never to leave early (which I don’t) and how dare I act like this after she let me have so much leave (which I had gotten approved before I even signed a contract). 

I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to cause a fuss with HR or her boss and have it back fire and I’m stuck working for this crazy bitch. I also don’t want to throw my colleague under the bus about being transparent about what she said. She very much has an attitude that she is untouchable and operates with that in mind. I only want to go above her if there’s a good chance it will make things better for me and future employees but right now I feel very trapped and don’t know how much more I can take.

I noticed, many of the drummers have elaborate charts to either catch accents, or bar and feel changes etc.  


Does anyone chart a mix while getting familiar w the song ?  

example..

you’re all setup, faders calibrated or whatever it is you gotta do , and you’re listening to the song in various chunks as you settle in. 

Does anyone grab a pen and paper and jot down stuff like … 

- parallel bit crush the hat and have the original hard left as the other moves M-R etc.   

- vocalist says ‘ feet feel tiny on your icey roof top hide away’ … I should give a feeling of isolation, automate verbs down, use the take where she’s almost mumbling it.   (comp a real one too tho).  

- bridge has a cuban percussion breakdown with the existing rock elements, but there’s a call and response.     maybe i can send the perc side chained to trigger a tiny bit of compression so i can get the attack from latin drums without it feeling too loud.  

-  bass keeps farting, player keeps hitting it, edit that. alternatively, just play their parts over at home.   

-already playlisted and comped quickies while we were doing drums,  need to either mangle the drums to fit new vocal style, or re-record a much softer take .. 


I kinda started realizing that my examples were weird and not a common thing tho maybe relatable.  

but you get the idea.  most stuff besides IO charts I keep in my head and just magically have good memory during work hours and i’m a brainless blob at home.     

Every assistant learns the idiosyncrasies of the engineer if they spend decent time watching and learning and making coffee etc.    the trust begins, and an apprentice is born.  

I might scribble parts that for some reason make sense to me but nobody else (happens the other way too).    like … corp lady likes 2trk feed into lounge and doesn’t like when sports center is on the tv.   

generally i write out the IO sorta after I do it lol.   It could be 100 inputs, but if you stick to your speedy routine, you don’t really need to count.   we get good at working in sets of 2/4/8/16/32 as well as up and down like input prefader or post or whatever.  

so i’ll jot like @00.1.15.05 - before prehook, automate a sweep filter just enough so you forget it until the chorus opens ur broken face.    


uh yeah everybody journals a song out when mixing right ?  


(maybe a lot of this is based on true stories of my times in studios, but i had more real questions when  mI started thumbing at my phone.  now i forgot my point and my hands hurt.       someone take it from here, they’re playing me out.  ",2,1735792512.0,audioengineering,3,1.0,False

I (m27) started to talking to a girl (f27) on hinge about a month ago which led to us talking nearly every day on snap and text. She lives in a different state but visits my city every month and is moving here in May. About a week ago she came down to visit and I picked her up and we went for coffee. Everything went great and she seemed really into me and asked to set a date up again two days later. Everything was good yet again and we went out Wednesday and this past Friday after that. 

On Friday we went to dinner and then ended up back at her place where we made out and cuddled until the morning. I asked her if she wanted to keep going out when she came back to Dallas to which she enthusiastically replied yes and also said we could FaceTime when she went back home. Well come Saturday morning and she starts being shorter with texts and then doesn’t text me at all Sunday even though we had plans on Monday morning for brunch. I asked her if things were cool and this is the message she responded with:

 “yes I agree that are dates went well and I had a good time with you. I am also very grateful for the things you have done for me. I want to be fully transparent with you as well, I don’t think I am ready for a type of commitment that I think you are looking for, especially me living in a different state”. I responded that I was just looking to keep hanging out and talking and that I had only asked because she hadn’t been texting me, then she replied again with “I don’t think it would be appropriate to keep seeing each other because I’m not ready to date anyone anyone for now and I don’t want to waste your time. I haven’t been texting as much today because I wanted to think about how to say it. I’m sorry if this upsets you”. 

I think I was maybe coming on a little too strong. For instance I made and brought her pasta which she said was really sweet and I also told her Saturday that I was excited for our date Monday. I’m still very confused though. She did mention that she wanted to take things slow and that she was concerned because I had recently came out of a relationship of 6 years but she seemed fine at first about us living in different states. I don’t know, I thought things were going pretty well and was wondering if there was anything I could say to repair this or if I should just leave it alone?",1,1735792496.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1hrlnc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/1hrlnc3/pei_justice_system/,Pei Justice System ,"PEI justice system. Published by the Globe and Mail.

The boys of Montague Regional High School peeled out of the school parking lot by the carload on a Friday morning, just a little over a week before last year’s Christmas break. They headed south toward a patchwork of dirt roads, woods and farmers’ fields in Prince Edward Island in search of their missing classmate and friend Tyson MacDonald.

It was unlike the 17-year-old to not text his mother, to not show up at the hockey game the night before. His Honda Civic, in which he loved to burn around the countryside, sat in the school parking lot covered in snow from the day before.
Within days, Tyson’s body was found lying in a thicket about a 20-minute drive from the home he shared with his mom, younger brother and stepfather.
A year later, the sleepy agricultural hamlets of Kings County are still reeling from his killing, the deceit in the aftermath and questions about what justice means when those involved are teenagers. Tyson’s homicide has touched thousands, a judge recently remarked, leaving no one unscathed – his family and friends in grief, the halls of Montague High in turmoil and an undercurrent of anger in his home community of 8,000 and beyond.

In many ways, PEI seemed immune to the recent spike in youth homicide and violence that’s plagued the rest of the country. The island, known for its tight, friendly communities and barely noticeable crime rate, has the fewest number of homicides per capita in the country, averaging one a year over the past five years.
But Tyson’s killing shattered the sense of safety and community, leaving an outrage that is omnipresent to this day: It’s in the way a cashier snatches bills from the hand of a customer who’s protested outside every court appearance. The frozen stares in Tim Hortons when someone connected to the case pulls into the drive thru. And the local truck owner with stickers on the back windshield that say it with a profanity: Only in PEI can you get away with murder.

Like many rural Canadian communities, hockey is religion in Kings County. Here the talk of the town isn’t the Leafs or the Oilers. It’s who made the local select team. Who scored the hat trick. It’s fiercely competitive, and everyone knows the score.
The day before Tyson went missing, he soared over the ice at his game, firing the puck twice into the net for the AA Under 18 Kings County Kings. “Hey mom!” he yelled as he burst in the front door after the game on Dec. 13, 2023, his mother Amanda MacDonald recalled. He couldn’t wait to tell her of his exploits.
The next day, when school ended, Tyson jumped in the car of a classmate, a burly outgoing friend, whom The Globe is referring to as the teen because his identity is now protected by a publication ban under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The two Grade 12 boys planned to attend a hockey game in Charlottetown that night, but first they headed back to the teen’s place to play video games.
At 7:20 p.m. she got a call from the teen and a second boy. Tyson had left with a girl, they claimed – a brown-haired girl with glasses in a dark Honda Civic. They told her the same story they repeated to police, friends and teachers. The teen provided a fantastic level of detail: She wore a fluorescent shirt and had a flower tattoo on her left arm. Tyson had been dropped off with her at her car, a 2010 model with yellow fog lights, tinted windows, steel rims and a G sticker on the windshield – last seen near the County Line Road.

After a sleepless night, Tyson’s mother called police on Friday morning.
The boys of Montague High were worried as they set out down Highway 315 to look for Tyson. His best friend Leo Cudmore, behind the wheel of his pickup truck, scanned the ditches and corn straw fields. The teen also joined in, leading his friends around the woods. Throngs of searchers joined the friends, family members and teachers combing the land on foot and astride ATVs, their eyes peeled for any sign of Kent and Amanda MacDonald’s oldest boy.
The high school opened its doors on the weekend for students to take a break from searching. Tyson’s sister, Britney, launched a social media page to track the public search. And she pored over her brother’s Instagram, looking for the brunette with the flower tattoo. “Is this her?” she texted the teen, sending pictures of random girls.
On the island of 178,000 people, connections between families run deep. It was no different for RCMP Staff Sergeant Mike Robinson, now head of the Montague detachment after nearly three decades in northern B.C. His father, a retired Mountie, had run the same detachment.
When Staff Sgt. Robinson heard the story from Ms. MacDonald, he felt the explanation for Tyson’s disappearance was off. The teen’s story didn’t add up. Over the weekend, he called on the major crime unit in Charlottetown. They seized the teen’s cellphone and dozens of officers along with drones, dogs and a helicopter descended on Eastern PEI.
Four days after Tyson’s disappearance, police discovered a large pool of blood in the woods off a back road. The case, RCMP advised the public, was now being investigated as a crime. They wouldn’t be needing any more tips on the unknown woman and the Honda Civic.
The town, initially worried, was now on edge, recalled Debbie Johnson, the mayor of Three Rivers, which includes seven rural municipalities in Kings County. “People were thinking ‘Do we have a murderer in the community?’”
Staff Sgt. Robinson warned Ms. MacDonald to brace herself for bad news. “No,” she recalled thinking. “No, he could still come.” She didn’t know this at the time, but police had arrested the two teen boys on suspicion of their involvement with Tyson’s disappearance.
The loud rap at the door came around 3:30 a.m., five days after Tyson disappeared. Ms. MacDonald, who was lying down with her youngest son, staggered to the door.
“We found Tyson,” Staff Sgt. Robinson told her in the porch light.
The teen had pointed out a location to police and Tyson’s remains were discovered off a nearby dirt road, stashed in a thicket of uprooted pines behind a blueberry field.
At Montague High, students were in shock as staff went class to class telling them the news. They packed up their school bags and huddled in groups in the hallway, sobbing and hugging.

The following day brought another blow. Two of their classmates had been charged with first-degree murder: the teen and the second boy who spread the story about Tyson going off with a girl.
The crime consumed the school. The rumour mill erupted. Was it over a girl? Was the teen jealous that he hadn’t made the AA hockey team? No one could understand why anyone would want to kill Tyson – an introvert with a big smile, who dropped by his grandmother’s house nearly every day for lunch. Teachers, thinking of how the teen repeated his story to them at school, were incredulous: Was he playing us? they wondered.
Over the course of the school year and the beginning of the next, attendance dropped off and students struggled to stay engaged. Exams were postponed. Stress and anger over the killing and who was responsible bubbled over. Fights erupted between friends. Others distanced themselves from each other, withdrew from activities, and abused drugs and alcohol.
It wasn’t until October, 10 months after he was killed, that the first details of the crime publicly emerged – a statement of facts read out in court on the same day the teen pleaded guilty to manslaughter under a deal with the prosecution.
It went like this: The boys were about to leave for the hockey game when the teen said there was a shotgun near the door. Tyson picked it up, pointed it jokingly at his friend, and set it back down.
The teen grabbed hold of the weapon and pointed it at his friend. Without checking to see whether the safety was on, he pulled the trigger and shot Tyson on the left side of his face in the front porch of the home. The teen panicked. He rolled Tyson’s body in a mat and shoved him into the back seat of his Ford Focus. He drove to a secluded asphalt road and dumped his friend’s body in a field in the freezing cold night.
He then picked up the second boy and the two headed into Charlottetown for the hockey game.
Days later, as the police search closed in on Tyson’s remains, the teen returned to the spot where he had dumped the body off the Greek River Road. He put his friend’s remains back in his car, drove 10 minutes down the road, and discarded him in the bush again, according to cellular records obtained by police.

The teen was sentenced on a dreary day in Charlottetown last month. Now 18, he clinked into the courtroom with shackles on his ankles, his eyes cast down. Tyson’s family – his parents, stepparents and three siblings – stared silently from a front row bench. Several sheriffs stood between them and the teen’s parents who sat alone across the aisle, his father hunched with his eyes closed, his mother weeping quietly.
Among the 100 or so people who spilled into a second courtroom to watch the proceeding were Tyson’s classmates, many wearing blue hoodies with a gold screen-printed image of him with angel wings gripping a hockey stick. The teen, in slacks and a button-up shirt, remained expressionless as the court heard how Tyson’s killing shattered his family and destroyed the tight-knit community’s sense of trust.
Ms. MacDonald spoke of the callous way her son’s body was left in the elements alone for five days, and how this robbed her and his loved ones of the chance to say goodbye. “We were told by my doctor and the funeral home that we should remember Tyson the way he was,” she told the court. “I always wonder – maybe I should have just seen his hand to hold one more time.”
She spoke of the agony of waking up every day without Tyson. How she misses the way he thundered up the stairs from his bedroom to get a glass of water. How he left all the cupboard doors wide open in the kitchen. Ripped open cereal boxes. His enormous appetite for pizza.
Many had been calling for the teen to be sentenced as an adult. Crown prosecutor John Diamond said he didn’t apply to do so because he didn’t see a prospect of meeting the legal test; the teen’s psychological education assessments showed he had a mild to moderate learning disability and he had no criminal record.
The court heard that the teen showed remorse, saying that if he could go back in time, he would have immediately called police after shooting Tyson.
The judge accepted a joint recommended sentence, handing the teen two years in custody and one year in the community under supervision for manslaughter, as well as 18 months in jail and six months under community supervision for interfering with human remains, to be served concurrently.
Tyson’s family was appalled. “I’m left speechless after today that the justice system thought my boy’s life was only worth two years,” wrote Tyson’s father, Kent MacDonald, on social media.
“He got two years – two years for taking someone’s life,” his best friend, Leo, said. “It doesn’t seem very fair.”
Friends since the second grade, the two dirt biked, fished and attended parties together. After high school they planned to travel, get an apartment and study trades. Now, Leo works at a beef farm. He sits at home most Friday nights by himself, goes to bed at 9:30 p.m.

The hardest fact of all, Ms. MacDonald and her daughters Sierra and Britney say, is that they may never know why Tyson was killed. Why, if it was an accident, did the teen hide the body? Why weave a web of lies? They’re also skeptical about the second boy’s involvement, though the court has accepted it as fact that he wasn’t present when Tyson’s body was moved.
At the family bungalow in the rural community of Belfast, Ms. MacDonald replays the deceit in her head: The Snapchat call from the teen where she recalled him saying, “I made sure he had his keys.” (Tyson’s car keys were later found thrown deep in the woods near his remains.) How the teen sat on her brown leather sofa – the same one Tyson used to curl up on with his golden retriever Stella – and fed her lies and accepted her hugs. (She later donated the sofa because she couldn’t bear to have it in the house.) “It just makes you sick.”
Tyson’s sister, Sierra, said the family would feel better if they believed it was an accident, but they’re not convinced it was. “We’re scared for him to come back in the community because we don’t know necessarily why it happened,” she said.
Leo echoes the family’s pain over what really happened between Tyson and the teen. “Everybody was mad about him getting away with it, but a lot of people just wanted to know why,” he said. “Why he would do that?”
The second boy, meanwhile, has already been released from youth jail after accepting a plea deal in February. Charges of first-degree murder, accessory after the fact and indignity to human remains were stayed and he pleaded guilty to public mischief and obstruction of justice for misleading police on a fruitless search for Tyson.
In court, he apologized for the harm he caused. The case has severely affected their lives, says the second boy’s father, who cannot be identified because of the publication ban on his son’s name. “We are giving the family their time and then we will have ours,” he said in a message.
In connection to the homicide, the teen’s father, 61, pleaded guilty to charges of unsafe storage of a firearm and ammunition. On Dec. 12, he was handed a $750 fine and banned from owning firearms for a decade.

At hockey rinks all over the island, Tyson is remembered. Teams raised thousands in support of a scholarship fund in his name. His No. 8 jersey, now retired, hangs in the local rink. Kings County Kings players wear his number on their helmets in his memory.
But there remains a heaviness, a sense of injustice in eastern PEI.
No matter where you go – the coffee shop, the auto parts store, the ferry – there are chance encounters between grandparents, parents and teens who used to be friends, but are now divided and bitter over the case.
The feeling of awkwardness will likely last generations, said Tyson’s former hockey coach Cory Deagle, the MLA for the district of Montague-Kilmuir, and Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Trade. “There’s a big sense of distrust,” he said. “There’s still a cloud over the community. There’s still a lot of questions in the community and I don’t know if they’ll ever be answered or maybe they can’t be.”
And then there are those harsh words on the back of the F150. While he didn’t know Tyson, the truck’s owner, Kevin McGuigan of Montague, said he posted the message because he’s angry.
“I think them boys should’ve got a lot more than they did. Nobody can tell me it was an accident,” he said, adding that locals have shown support for his statement, buying him coffee, blowing their horn and giving him the thumbs-up. “I laid in bed a lot of nights thinking about that poor little boy lying in the woods.”
At Montague High, the pain persists. The school has been forever changed, principal Robyn MacDonald wrote in the school’s victim impact statement, presented at the teen’s sentencing. (She’s not related to Tyson’s family.)
She said school staff have done everything in their power to help students, consulting with trauma experts, bringing in a motivational speaker, holding town hall meetings, but it hasn’t been enough. She cited more fights between students this year than ever before. “Tension is high, and a growing trend of vigilante justice has emerged,” she wrote.
At the Grade 12 graduation in June, Leo, standing in his cap and gown, watched Tyson’s sister Britney accept his diploma and the crowd rise to emotional standing ovation. “It should’ve been him,” Leo recalled thinking. “It felt wrong.”
The crime changed everyone, said Angela Patton of Montague, a mother of two teenagers and a young adult, who joined the search for Tyson and attended court.

My wife and I had the pleasure of meeting someone outside the Drury Lane Theatre last night after the show. They were waiting by the stage door, and we had a lovely chat about theatre. Unfortunately, due to social anxiety, I didn’t ask for their name or contact information, but we felt a real connection and would love the chance to reconnect.

Here’s what I know about them:
	•	They live in Stoke-on-Trent.
	•	They have long blue hair.
	•	They were in New York recently (possibly the day before) to see Sunset Boulevard.
	•	They’re a big fan of Jamie Lloyd productions.
	•	Yesterday, they managed to see three West End shows and mentioned planning to see more today!

If this sounds like you—or if you know someone it might be—please feel free to reach out. My wife and I would love to meet up for coffee and chat more about our shared love of theatre.

1hrlmls,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrlmls,I met the man I’d been praying for… on Reddit of all places! ,"I still can’t believe I met the man I’d been praying for… on Reddit of all places!  

It started on January 2, when he sent me a message. At first, it was just casual talk between two strangers sharing crazy interests. I wasn’t paying much attention until I discovered he’s a huge fan of Attack on Titan—my favorite anime. From that moment, something about him drew me in, like we’d known each other forever.  

By January 4, we met for a friendly coffee date, not realizing how life-changing it would be. The moment we met, I felt this strange and wonderful feeling, like I had just found home.  

Things moved quickly, but it felt right. On January 7, just three days after our first meeting, he asked me to be his girlfriend—inside a church! That thoughtful gesture melted my heart. By February 4, I couldn’t hold back anymore. I said yes. It felt special to make it official on 02-04-2024, a Sunday, at the same church where he first asked me to be his girl.  

Now, a year later, I’m still amazed at how love found me in the most unexpected way. Who would’ve thought a random Reddit message would bring me my favorite plot twist—and the man who turned my prayers into reality. I love you so much, my wolfpup. 🤍  ",61,1735792238.0,CasualPH,36,0.78,False
1hrlm7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_That-Grapefruit7665/comments/1hrlm7z/pei_justice_system/,Pei Justice System ,"PEI justice system. Published by the Globe and Mail.

The boys of Montague Regional High School peeled out of the school parking lot by the carload on a Friday morning, just a little over a week before last year’s Christmas break. They headed south toward a patchwork of dirt roads, woods and farmers’ fields in Prince Edward Island in search of their missing classmate and friend Tyson MacDonald.

It was unlike the 17-year-old to not text his mother, to not show up at the hockey game the night before. His Honda Civic, in which he loved to burn around the countryside, sat in the school parking lot covered in snow from the day before.
Within days, Tyson’s body was found lying in a thicket about a 20-minute drive from the home he shared with his mom, younger brother and stepfather.
A year later, the sleepy agricultural hamlets of Kings County are still reeling from his killing, the deceit in the aftermath and questions about what justice means when those involved are teenagers. Tyson’s homicide has touched thousands, a judge recently remarked, leaving no one unscathed – his family and friends in grief, the halls of Montague High in turmoil and an undercurrent of anger in his home community of 8,000 and beyond.

In many ways, PEI seemed immune to the recent spike in youth homicide and violence that’s plagued the rest of the country. The island, known for its tight, friendly communities and barely noticeable crime rate, has the fewest number of homicides per capita in the country, averaging one a year over the past five years.
But Tyson’s killing shattered the sense of safety and community, leaving an outrage that is omnipresent to this day: It’s in the way a cashier snatches bills from the hand of a customer who’s protested outside every court appearance. The frozen stares in Tim Hortons when someone connected to the case pulls into the drive thru. And the local truck owner with stickers on the back windshield that say it with a profanity: Only in PEI can you get away with murder.

Like many rural Canadian communities, hockey is religion in Kings County. Here the talk of the town isn’t the Leafs or the Oilers. It’s who made the local select team. Who scored the hat trick. It’s fiercely competitive, and everyone knows the score.
The day before Tyson went missing, he soared over the ice at his game, firing the puck twice into the net for the AA Under 18 Kings County Kings. “Hey mom!” he yelled as he burst in the front door after the game on Dec. 13, 2023, his mother Amanda MacDonald recalled. He couldn’t wait to tell her of his exploits.
The next day, when school ended, Tyson jumped in the car of a classmate, a burly outgoing friend, whom The Globe is referring to as the teen because his identity is now protected by a publication ban under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The two Grade 12 boys planned to attend a hockey game in Charlottetown that night, but first they headed back to the teen’s place to play video games.
At 7:20 p.m. she got a call from the teen and a second boy. Tyson had left with a girl, they claimed – a brown-haired girl with glasses in a dark Honda Civic. They told her the same story they repeated to police, friends and teachers. The teen provided a fantastic level of detail: She wore a fluorescent shirt and had a flower tattoo on her left arm. Tyson had been dropped off with her at her car, a 2010 model with yellow fog lights, tinted windows, steel rims and a G sticker on the windshield – last seen near the County Line Road.

After a sleepless night, Tyson’s mother called police on Friday morning.
The boys of Montague High were worried as they set out down Highway 315 to look for Tyson. His best friend Leo Cudmore, behind the wheel of his pickup truck, scanned the ditches and corn straw fields. The teen also joined in, leading his friends around the woods. Throngs of searchers joined the friends, family members and teachers combing the land on foot and astride ATVs, their eyes peeled for any sign of Kent and Amanda MacDonald’s oldest boy.
The high school opened its doors on the weekend for students to take a break from searching. Tyson’s sister, Britney, launched a social media page to track the public search. And she pored over her brother’s Instagram, looking for the brunette with the flower tattoo. “Is this her?” she texted the teen, sending pictures of random girls.
On the island of 178,000 people, connections between families run deep. It was no different for RCMP Staff Sergeant Mike Robinson, now head of the Montague detachment after nearly three decades in northern B.C. His father, a retired Mountie, had run the same detachment.
When Staff Sgt. Robinson heard the story from Ms. MacDonald, he felt the explanation for Tyson’s disappearance was off. The teen’s story didn’t add up. Over the weekend, he called on the major crime unit in Charlottetown. They seized the teen’s cellphone and dozens of officers along with drones, dogs and a helicopter descended on Eastern PEI.
Four days after Tyson’s disappearance, police discovered a large pool of blood in the woods off a back road. The case, RCMP advised the public, was now being investigated as a crime. They wouldn’t be needing any more tips on the unknown woman and the Honda Civic.
The town, initially worried, was now on edge, recalled Debbie Johnson, the mayor of Three Rivers, which includes seven rural municipalities in Kings County. “People were thinking ‘Do we have a murderer in the community?’”
Staff Sgt. Robinson warned Ms. MacDonald to brace herself for bad news. “No,” she recalled thinking. “No, he could still come.” She didn’t know this at the time, but police had arrested the two teen boys on suspicion of their involvement with Tyson’s disappearance.
The loud rap at the door came around 3:30 a.m., five days after Tyson disappeared. Ms. MacDonald, who was lying down with her youngest son, staggered to the door.
“We found Tyson,” Staff Sgt. Robinson told her in the porch light.
The teen had pointed out a location to police and Tyson’s remains were discovered off a nearby dirt road, stashed in a thicket of uprooted pines behind a blueberry field.
At Montague High, students were in shock as staff went class to class telling them the news. They packed up their school bags and huddled in groups in the hallway, sobbing and hugging.

The following day brought another blow. Two of their classmates had been charged with first-degree murder: the teen and the second boy who spread the story about Tyson going off with a girl.
The crime consumed the school. The rumour mill erupted. Was it over a girl? Was the teen jealous that he hadn’t made the AA hockey team? No one could understand why anyone would want to kill Tyson – an introvert with a big smile, who dropped by his grandmother’s house nearly every day for lunch. Teachers, thinking of how the teen repeated his story to them at school, were incredulous: Was he playing us? they wondered.
Over the course of the school year and the beginning of the next, attendance dropped off and students struggled to stay engaged. Exams were postponed. Stress and anger over the killing and who was responsible bubbled over. Fights erupted between friends. Others distanced themselves from each other, withdrew from activities, and abused drugs and alcohol.
It wasn’t until October, 10 months after he was killed, that the first details of the crime publicly emerged – a statement of facts read out in court on the same day the teen pleaded guilty to manslaughter under a deal with the prosecution.
It went like this: The boys were about to leave for the hockey game when the teen said there was a shotgun near the door. Tyson picked it up, pointed it jokingly at his friend, and set it back down.
The teen grabbed hold of the weapon and pointed it at his friend. Without checking to see whether the safety was on, he pulled the trigger and shot Tyson on the left side of his face in the front porch of the home. The teen panicked. He rolled Tyson’s body in a mat and shoved him into the back seat of his Ford Focus. He drove to a secluded asphalt road and dumped his friend’s body in a field in the freezing cold night.
He then picked up the second boy and the two headed into Charlottetown for the hockey game.
Days later, as the police search closed in on Tyson’s remains, the teen returned to the spot where he had dumped the body off the Greek River Road. He put his friend’s remains back in his car, drove 10 minutes down the road, and discarded him in the bush again, according to cellular records obtained by police.

The teen was sentenced on a dreary day in Charlottetown last month. Now 18, he clinked into the courtroom with shackles on his ankles, his eyes cast down. Tyson’s family – his parents, stepparents and three siblings – stared silently from a front row bench. Several sheriffs stood between them and the teen’s parents who sat alone across the aisle, his father hunched with his eyes closed, his mother weeping quietly.
Among the 100 or so people who spilled into a second courtroom to watch the proceeding were Tyson’s classmates, many wearing blue hoodies with a gold screen-printed image of him with angel wings gripping a hockey stick. The teen, in slacks and a button-up shirt, remained expressionless as the court heard how Tyson’s killing shattered his family and destroyed the tight-knit community’s sense of trust.
Ms. MacDonald spoke of the callous way her son’s body was left in the elements alone for five days, and how this robbed her and his loved ones of the chance to say goodbye. “We were told by my doctor and the funeral home that we should remember Tyson the way he was,” she told the court. “I always wonder – maybe I should have just seen his hand to hold one more time.”
She spoke of the agony of waking up every day without Tyson. How she misses the way he thundered up the stairs from his bedroom to get a glass of water. How he left all the cupboard doors wide open in the kitchen. Ripped open cereal boxes. His enormous appetite for pizza.
Many had been calling for the teen to be sentenced as an adult. Crown prosecutor John Diamond said he didn’t apply to do so because he didn’t see a prospect of meeting the legal test; the teen’s psychological education assessments showed he had a mild to moderate learning disability and he had no criminal record.
The court heard that the teen showed remorse, saying that if he could go back in time, he would have immediately called police after shooting Tyson.
The judge accepted a joint recommended sentence, handing the teen two years in custody and one year in the community under supervision for manslaughter, as well as 18 months in jail and six months under community supervision for interfering with human remains, to be served concurrently.
Tyson’s family was appalled. “I’m left speechless after today that the justice system thought my boy’s life was only worth two years,” wrote Tyson’s father, Kent MacDonald, on social media.
“He got two years – two years for taking someone’s life,” his best friend, Leo, said. “It doesn’t seem very fair.”
Friends since the second grade, the two dirt biked, fished and attended parties together. After high school they planned to travel, get an apartment and study trades. Now, Leo works at a beef farm. He sits at home most Friday nights by himself, goes to bed at 9:30 p.m.

The hardest fact of all, Ms. MacDonald and her daughters Sierra and Britney say, is that they may never know why Tyson was killed. Why, if it was an accident, did the teen hide the body? Why weave a web of lies? They’re also skeptical about the second boy’s involvement, though the court has accepted it as fact that he wasn’t present when Tyson’s body was moved.
At the family bungalow in the rural community of Belfast, Ms. MacDonald replays the deceit in her head: The Snapchat call from the teen where she recalled him saying, “I made sure he had his keys.” (Tyson’s car keys were later found thrown deep in the woods near his remains.) How the teen sat on her brown leather sofa – the same one Tyson used to curl up on with his golden retriever Stella – and fed her lies and accepted her hugs. (She later donated the sofa because she couldn’t bear to have it in the house.) “It just makes you sick.”
Tyson’s sister, Sierra, said the family would feel better if they believed it was an accident, but they’re not convinced it was. “We’re scared for him to come back in the community because we don’t know necessarily why it happened,” she said.
Leo echoes the family’s pain over what really happened between Tyson and the teen. “Everybody was mad about him getting away with it, but a lot of people just wanted to know why,” he said. “Why he would do that?”
The second boy, meanwhile, has already been released from youth jail after accepting a plea deal in February. Charges of first-degree murder, accessory after the fact and indignity to human remains were stayed and he pleaded guilty to public mischief and obstruction of justice for misleading police on a fruitless search for Tyson.
In court, he apologized for the harm he caused. The case has severely affected their lives, says the second boy’s father, who cannot be identified because of the publication ban on his son’s name. “We are giving the family their time and then we will have ours,” he said in a message.
In connection to the homicide, the teen’s father, 61, pleaded guilty to charges of unsafe storage of a firearm and ammunition. On Dec. 12, he was handed a $750 fine and banned from owning firearms for a decade.

At hockey rinks all over the island, Tyson is remembered. Teams raised thousands in support of a scholarship fund in his name. His No. 8 jersey, now retired, hangs in the local rink. Kings County Kings players wear his number on their helmets in his memory.
But there remains a heaviness, a sense of injustice in eastern PEI.
No matter where you go – the coffee shop, the auto parts store, the ferry – there are chance encounters between grandparents, parents and teens who used to be friends, but are now divided and bitter over the case.
The feeling of awkwardness will likely last generations, said Tyson’s former hockey coach Cory Deagle, the MLA for the district of Montague-Kilmuir, and Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Trade. “There’s a big sense of distrust,” he said. “There’s still a cloud over the community. There’s still a lot of questions in the community and I don’t know if they’ll ever be answered or maybe they can’t be.”
And then there are those harsh words on the back of the F150. While he didn’t know Tyson, the truck’s owner, Kevin McGuigan of Montague, said he posted the message because he’s angry.
“I think them boys should’ve got a lot more than they did.

I just wanted to be sure and know the machines limit . 

I guess on an average i might be making around 15-30 cups of coffee for 6 hours a day, will the machine sustain this intensity on a daily basis with constant cleaning and maintenance? ",3,1735791397.0,Lelit,0,0.81,False

I went through chemo.  Before you feel sorry for me, let me tell you, there was one strange silver lining.  I didn't have the blocked nose, used tissues scattered around my morning coffee cup.  I didn't start violently sneezing at sundown when the temperature changed.  Weird, I know.

So when the chemo stopped, the NAR symptoms came back with a vengeance.  This was not good as now I have radiation therapy and I need to lie on my back for about 1/2 hour.  Anyone see any problems here?  Only if you are a NAR sufferer.  The technician is telling me not to cough.  Yeah, let me drown in my own mucus, Bud.  I hold it as long as I can but you know, I start coughing.  He tells me in a stern voice, ""It's very important that you don't cough.""  I mean, what an idiot.  Right now, Bud, this is not what I need.

This morning as I lay in my bed, my nose hasn't woken up, so I can breathe through it which is so nice, but I know it won't last long once I get up, the nasal faucet turns on.  But this morning as I make my coffee, I go to the fridge where I keep my CBD stuff and use the nasal spray, and....it stops.  My neurotic nasal nerves stop telling my cells to inflame and secret mucus out of fright.

I'm not coughing due to post nasal drip.  I just have the residual mucus from the first fright.

Could this be????  I'll let you know.  I tried Claritin and it worked for about a week, so I'm not making any promises.  But what I do know, is today, this early morning--I can breathe through my nose.",5,1735791368.0,nonallergicrhinitis,2,0.86,False
1hrld07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hrld07/did_i_miss_the_red_flags/,Did I miss the Red Flags?,"Happy New Year! So I’ve had probably somewhat poor decision making in my ability to filter women before first dates. Thanks if you’re taking the time to read this and give me your advice. Also, please feel free to add what you find to be something that’s more of a silent red flag, meaning it’s not a problem by itself, but it puts you on alert.

Hey, so I went on a date with a woman  (34) I met off bumble. We had a lot of really unique and solid conversation. Normally, I take a bit more time, but literally she said “hey when are you going to ask me out on a date?” I figured why not. We switched to text in order to advance things.

Eventually, our texting actually grew pretty strong and I thought at a minimum she’d probably be someone I’d go on a few dates with — beyond that obviously I had no clue. I felt in texting she was flirty and brought out my flirty and less serious side. I can definitely be quite sarcastic and funny/flirty, but it usually comes naturally to me if I’m with the right person. She did mention she lived with her parents, to no extent how long, maybe I should have asked? However she said she was moving out in 13 days, so I just ignored it.

The night before our date, she got talking about sexual stuff before dating. She said something along the lines of “no second, third, or fourth base before VIP Status.” I said like, what the hell does that mean? Exclusivity? Dating? She proceeded to tell me and she really said “I don’t really know I just know I want to make changes because I end up getting used.” She was kinda low confidence and when I was giving her compliments, she would like always find a way to put herself down. I feel like the fact that when I asked her questions, she kept changing her mind and didn’t know, making something up on the spot when she felt she found a guy she was interested in was a giant red flag in hindsight.

The day of our date, we make the plans. I tell her from like 3:00 PM when I had so much stuff to do it would probably be around 8:45 PM based on my best guess. At 6:00 PM I updated her and said that it’d still be around that time. Long story short is I told her 9:00 PM and I was driving from an hour away. She texts me saying okay she’ll be there. All of a sudden at 9:15 she says she’ll be 15 mins late. At 9:30 she says she had to turn around because she forgot something. I was ready to leave when she said she’d be a little late, then was already late, and ended up saying she’d be even later. However, because of our kind of strong connection was had previously I gave her a chance.

We met up — she wasn’t like she was in texting — but I chalked it up to nervousness. There was a lack of flirting, just strange mannerisms and like odd smiles. Physically, I also felt like her photos were a touch off, didn’t really show off her body accurately. First dates for me are to figure out if someone has dealbreakers, red flags I can’t handle, genuinely large differences that won’t work for a relationship, etc. She chose a date at a coffee shop turned into night club for NYE. She didn’t know it’d be so loud. I learned she had ADHD — she was literally spacing off in between thoughts and having real difficulties forming her sentences and questions. I chose not to hold it against her and attributed like I said, her conversation weaknesses as nervousness. She did text me before the date saying she was nervous.

After about an hour, she goes to the bathroom. I’d say at this point I was still open to a second date, although I wasn’t feeling some huge romantic chemistry. The thing is, I truly do believe the first date is a screening date, so I don’t have insane expectations beyond making sure someone’s bag shit insane.

She comes back and is acting kind of odd. She stood at her chair instead of sitting down. I am asking questions, asking if she’d rather leave and go somewhere quieter as it was really, really loud and just not a great first date place whatsoever. Eventually, after 15 mins she blurts out of nowhere “I don’t feel any spark sorry.” She then proceeded to patronize me and say “listen you’ll make someone so happy, you’re such an amazing guy.” However, she seemed so pissed while she was saying all this. She asked in some weird way “hey how do you feel about this? Let me know.” I wasn’t gonna talk about this in a loud bar. She asked what I wanted to do, and I just told her it was best if she left, specifically because she felt so angry when she’d said she didn’t feel anything.

I texted her afterwards to say my peace and mentioned how her being late was really uncool, as well as how she said what she said was just not cool. I thanked her for being honest, but I said she didn’t have to act so…angry about it. She said she was frustrated it wasn’t going to work out as she had high hopes.

**Conclusion and TLDR** So, my question is, her inability to know her own boundaries for dating, coupled with being really late — were those things that should have really raised issue? Her inability to know boundaries, she indicated she dated pretty shitty men. I know we can’t all make perfect dating choices, but between the insecurities and bad choices in men, I feel like it should have been in hindsight a “leave it” moment. Her living at home for an undisclosed period of time as well, is that something in conjunction with the other stuff something to show immaturity/reliance on things? 

Are these minor inconvenience issues or things I should be pickier about in protecting myself, my emotions, and my time when dating? I just am really over dating and want to be pickier to these types of situations don’t repeat themselves. Any advice you have on filtering through matches, especially when in the pre-date but post-app phase would be very welcomed! Thanks!",1,1735791314.0,Bumble,12,1.0,False
