1q57bq6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q57bq6,Why is my coffee bitter? [Breville Barista Express],"I’ve had my machine for about 6 months, and recently swapped to the ‘single wall’ double shot after previously using the double wall exclusively. I’m not gonna claim I was pulling professional level shots before, but they were consistently palatable.

I’ve pulled good shots since I ran my last cafiza. Fresh water in the tank. Running a ‘rinse’ blank before each shot, and a rinse after. The group screen is clean. 

I am using the same espresso roast - lavazza. I did not change my grind size. Using 18g like always, and gets to about 6-8 seconds before it starts coming through portafilter. Ending at \~20 seconds with 34g (Was slow stopping the timer). Getting up to or just below center of ‘grey pressure zone’. Puck comes out solid.

Zero crema. Comes out even on both sides, but super black. Very bitter. A liquid punch in the mouth.

Anyone else find the breville single wall double to be oversized and tamper bottoms out since filter basket walls aren’t straight? Or is the grind too fine? Was hoping I could swap up to the single wall from the pre-k double wall.

Any help much appreciated!",1,1767669545.0,espresso,3,0.99,False

1q57app,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q57app/would_like_some_opinions_on_my_current_situation/,Would like some opinions on my current situation,"I want to be clear, this person and I never actually dated, but I felt this was the most relevant place to post. I (27M) work as a history teacher, and this year we hired a new Behavior Tech (23F). At first, things were going normally, but as she and I started talking and getting to know each other more, it seemed like there might have been something there. We shared a similar sense of humor and joked around with each other so much. It was honestly the first time I felt like I could be genuinely myself with someone. One incident that stands out to me is when she complimented my jacket. It was a red raincoat, and she had said it would be better in blue, to which I replied that red was the better color. This turned into a week of us dressing in our respective colors and even drawing pictures to hide for one another to find. To me, this felt like something else. The next week, I was at a bookstore, and I saw a crochet kit. I knew she liked to crochet, so I bought it and gave it to her the next day. I was really worried about how it would look on my end, but she was super excited and started working on it right away, always coming by to show me the progress. Finally, after a week, I asked her to go to lunch on black friday. She agreed and gave me her number so we could set something up. We did meet, but only for coffee, as she wasn't hungry, and honestly, neither was I. We spent about two hours chatting and playing cards before she asked me why I had asked her to hang out. I told her upfront about my feelings and how I wanted to see if it might work out. She told me there that she didn't date her coworkers. Which is fine by me. However, she continued talking and ended with ""I like you too"". This left me somewhat confused, and I wasn't sure where to go with the information. A little over two weeks have passed, and we are still texting briefly. One day, I told her I was going to watch one of the movies she recommended to me, and she told me to pause the movie so she could watch it with me virtually. We watched the movie together, and then she FaceTimed me for 2.5 hours. The next night, she and I were texting again, but this time it got deeper. We discussed the things that were bothering us, and I finally asked her what she meant when she said she ""liked me too"". She then told me that there was something between us, but she was scared of relationships. She told me that once we were no longer coworkers, it would be different. This was all fine to me, though it still felt a little vague. The next night, a student had a play, so she and I went to it, but sat separately. After the play, we went and got dinner, and when we were about to part ways, she asked for a hug. For me, I was pretty hyped after this; I'm not going to lie. It was probably one of the best car rides home I had had in a while. On Saturday, we texted somewhat sporadically, as she isn't very good at texting. However, later that night, she Facetimed me again and asked for my address. She came over and picked me up, and we had a great time. We went to the lake, got pizza, and had a great time. I joked that next time I would randomly show up at her place, and she said, ""My place is a girl's household, so probably not,"" and this matters later. However, I was confused, the hug and now the random appearance at my house didn't feel like things coworkers did. So, once again, we had a conversation about what was going on. She said that she was just a flirty person and had a wandering eye. She told me that everything I said was right, but she didn't feel anything because of her meds. This left me even more confused because her words seemed to say one thing, but her actions suggested something else. We barely talked the next day. Then from Monday to Thursday I was left on delivered. I didn't double-text or anything purely because I didn't want to look desperate, but it did bother me a bit. At school, though, she was still messing with me and going out of her way to be in my room. She came across the school just to borrow some Lysol wipes. During this time, I learned new terms such as ""anxious attachment"" and ""avoidant attachment"". Now I'm a teacher, not a doctor, but from what I was gathering through the psychologists on Instagram (I know, not a great source) and my research online, it felt that I fell under the anxious attachment and her the avoidant. That Friday was the last day of school, and she was heading home for the holidays. I expected not to hear from her for the next weeks. Instead, she texted and Facetimed me often. We spoke to each other every day through text or FaceTime. Sometimes she'd just send a picture of herself or FaceTime me to show me her hair or her outfit for the day. So again, I was just confused and surprised. I loved it though. She made me so happy, and I enjoyed spending time with her. One day, she was really down on herself, and I gave her kind words and reassured her that she was not alone. She responded with ""I am glad you are in my life,"" and my heart melted a little bit. I told her the same thing. New Year's came around and stayed up just to spend the New Year's with me, even though she was in a different time zone. She told me that she really enjoyed talking to me. When she came home, her roommate couldn't pick her up, so I stayed up till 1 am to pick her up from the airport and drop her off. This was kind of big for me because she said that I'd never come over to her place. I also had gotten her a Christmas gift, but because she left early, I wasn't able to give it to her before break, so I brought it with me to pick her up. I knew she liked to paint, so I got her a bunch of paints, small canvases, and easels. The next day, she opened the gift and told me I was the sweetest person ever. We talked for a bit and I mentioned one of my favorite horror movies and how it would be cool to watch it virtually with her. She then asked me if I'd want to come over and watch it with her. To be clear (and I'm sorry because I know this is a lot of stuff you're reading, but I feel it all matters) I had no intentions of sleeping with her. Yes, I was attracted to her physically, but I was more invested in the time we spent together emotionally, if that makes sense. So, I did go over; we watched the movie and spent about three hours just chilling. Nothing happened between us besides some long stares and smiles. As I left, she asked how I was feeling, and I told her that I really liked her and that I was sorry to keep bringing it up, but I felt I needed to communicate with her and wanted to improve our communication. She said it was okay for me to feel that way and that it was all right. The next day, she said that I had misinterpreted our friendship and that we wanted different things. That was yesterday; as I write this, I'm still crying. I guess I am confused. Did I read too much into it? Is she just being avoidant? Have I been discarded? I see a lot of information on the internet about avoidants and discarding, but I'm unsure if I fall into that category or not. I just hope someone can help guide me a bit here and tell me what might be going on. I just need some help because I am lost and in so much pain. Thank you for reading this far.

“You can start by putting the money in fucking bag Rac bitch!”

Kas was struck by the butt of the shotgun the robber had. She fell to the floor hard, her nose bleeding. 

A panic scream came from the snack section as a small Mosulin girl dropped everything she was holding to stack the shelves. 

The robber, a tall angler fish-like alien with dark black scales, rows of thin sharp teeth and milky white eyes, looked at the sacred mosulin girl and barked orders to her.

“Get over here and get on the ground!” He pointed the shotgun at her.

Panic, the mouslin obeyed his orders. He then focused back on the Rac manager and shouted at her once more to open the register and hand over the money. 

A sound of someone grabbing things off the shelf came next to the fish man and he groaned with annoyance. 

“Bilg, stop looting the snacks and go grab the safe from the back!” 

A skinny eel-like alien stopped what it was doing and hissed. 

“Im hungry boss, plus free Gong bars always taste best when stolen.”

“If it were not for the fact that you are my brother I would shoot you here and now. Now go get the safe in the back you idiot!” 

Kas turn to look at the Mouslin girl. 

“Jenny, you put a fresh coffee on when I asked you to?” kas asked holding her bleeding nose.

“Y-yes w-why?” Jenny squeaked.

“Good, the humans will be needed soon.” kas smiled.

The angler fish alien looked down at Kas and saw her smile.

“Why are smiling fur ball?” He would press the barrel of the shotgun to her chest.

“You are robbing a store protected by blitz security. The humans are on their way right now or just outside.”

The fish man's blood dropped cold. And the eel alien stopped what he was doing and looked at his boss.

“B-b-boss, we're robbing a human protected store! We gotta go now!”

Kas just laughed, “It's too late, friend.”

I’ve been obsessing over simple binary choices lately (Coffee vs. Tea, Dark Mode vs. Light Mode, etc.).

I had a hypothesis: Can an algorithm predict random facts about a person based solely on their answers to these trivial ""This vs. That"" questions?

To test this, I built a service that runs calculations on user choices to see if there are hidden correlations in the data. Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for ""Pineapple on Pizza"" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.

It’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.

Instead I dream about some twins talking in reverse and a cup of frozen coffee.
I wake up to Lucy handing me the opposite and sitting on the edge of the bed.
“You slept better this time,” she says, rubbing my head like she lost something in my hair.
I nod, sip the coffee, and glance at the clock.
I nearly burn my sinuses out my nose when I see it’s noon.
“Fuck. I’m supposed to be helping Jack with his truck two hours ago.”
Lucy and I sprint through the house, grabbing the clothes I stripped off last night. I nearly trip out the front door, kissing her as I pull on my left boot.
I drive through the now-alive town while Simon Le Bon tells me he gets high off perfume or something. I stop at a red light and stare into the woods.
The peak of the mountain where the caves live rises above the trees, peeking out like it’s spying on Thorn Hollow. The whole town could fit inside it and still have room for another one.
I break eye contact when someone guns it past me, trying to beat the Hamburglar to McDonald’s.
I pull up to Jack’s with a peace offering from Debbie’s. Hopefully that smooths things over.
I call into his garage, where the dead body of his truck sits—older than half the town.
“Dave! I’m on the roof. Thank God you’re here, boy.”
I shield my eyes from the sun and spot Jack waving like he’s been stranded on an uncharted island for years.
“Why the hell are you on the roof, old man?”
He flips me off and holds up a wrench.
“Found my wrench up here again. Fuckin’ thing moves I swear.”
I shake my head.
“The ladder fell. I've been up here since eleven. Get it standing before I turn into Jack jerky.”
He points to the left side of the garage. I head over.
The ladder looks like someone had four quarters and enough nails to stick a tank to a wall.
“Jesus, Jack. I’m gonna get tetanus just looking at this thing.”
“Oh shut the fuck up before I drop like your balls should’ve.”
I chuckle and lift the ladder like it’s a World War II mine about to go off, setting it against the garage. Jack slides down like he isn’t sixty-five and immediately grabs the bag of donuts.
“Better be jelly, David.”
I nod. He smacks my back. I wince.
“Hey, elder you forgot the wrench.”
He frowns so hard his eyes turn into eyebrows.
“Well shit. You grab it. I’ve been up there for hours because you wanna be fat and grab donuts.”
He sucks jelly off his thumb.
“I’ve got one in my tool bag. I brought it from a late call last night.”
He waves his donut at me. I go to the truck and carry my bag into the garage and we get to work. Mostly he hands me tools and tells me stories about races he won with this carcass.
I ask for my pliers.
He doesn’t hand them over.
“You lose your hearing, old ma—”
I stop. Jack’s face is wrong. His wrinkles don’t fold the way they should.
“David,” he says quietly. “Where did you get this?”
He’s staring at the hook from last night. It shimmers under the light of his garage.
I forgot to show Frankie. The jelly donut distracts all.
“I forgot it was in there. Some spike lodged in a gas line from a late-night call.”
His eyes lock onto it.
“I haven’t seen anything like this since I was your age. I don’t remember how—but I’ve seen this.”
His hands shake. He pulls the pliers apart, lets the hook fall back into my bag, and hands them to me.
I stare at him.
“You tryna kiss me or what, boy?”
I chuckle.
“You’re sick. Get back on your meds.”
We work a while longer until I hit a bolt I can’t loosen with anything I’ve got.
“I can’t get this one, old man. What size is it?”
He studies the engine, then stares at the ceiling.
“It’s not in your bag. It’s on the roof. I stole it last week when you were here.”
I press my palms into my cheeks and groan.
“You klepto. You could’ve just asked.”
He shrugs.
I grab my ladder from the truck and lean it against the garage.
It’s not tall enough.
“Jack, grab my tool bag I need my gloves to climb your damn lad—”
He shoves the bag into my chest. He already has it.
I snatch it back, and push him away,  I pull on my gloves, and plant the ladder. Every step creaks and bends like it’s arguing with my boots.
I look down at him, teeth clenched. He gives me a thumbs-up.
“You’re doing great, boy. Built that thing before your daddy fucked your mom.”
“No shit,” I mutter.
I roll onto the roof like I climbed Everest.
“Grab the wrench before I die of old age!” Jack yells.
I toss it down, then glance toward the mountain again. The sun dips behind it. Something flickers near the base—like fire.
“C’mon, you big pussy,” Jack shouts.
I breathe out and step toward the ladder.
“Oh wait, David don’t step there, it’ll—”
The rung snaps.
I fall through the ladder and slam onto my tool bag. The air rips out of my lungs. My spine cracks. I make a noise like a kid squeezing a rubber chicken too hard.
Jack says something I can’t hear, then laughs like I didn’t fall 20 feet.
I roll off the bag and suck in my first breath.
“Mmmfuck you, old man.”
He laughs harder until a two-by-four smacks him in the head.
I scramble over to him. He’s rubbing his skull, and I laugh at him then points at my waist.
“David… you’re bleeding.”
I look down.
The hook is sticking through my hip, coming from the back it.

1q576e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1q576e2/the_psychology_of_dark_persuasion_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Dark Persuasion: Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work (Use Wisely),"You've noticed it, right? Some people just seem to have this invisible superpower. They walk into a room, and everyone leans in. They ask for something, and people say yes without thinking twice. They navigate social situations like they're playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.

Here's what nobody tells you: It's not charisma. It's not luck. It's psychology. And yeah, some of it lives in the grey zone between influence and manipulation. I've spent months digging through research papers, binge-watching behavioural psychology content, and reading everything from Robert Greene to modern cognitive science studies. What do I find? These tactics work. They work really well. But they come with a responsibility label.

The thing is, understanding these mechanisms isn't about becoming a manipulative asshole. It's about recognising when they're being used ON you, and occasionally leveraging them ethically when it matters. Society's already using these tricks on you through advertising, social media algorithms, and political campaigns. You're swimming in psychological manipulation daily. Might as well understand the water you're in.

Step 1: Master the Power of Silence

Most people are terrified of silence. Like, genuinely scared of those awkward pauses in conversation. Here's the trick: Stop filling the void.

When you ask someone a question, and they give you a half-answer, just sit there. Don't nod enthusiastically. Don't jump in with your own story. Just maintain eye contact and wait. The psychological discomfort of silence will literally force them to keep talking and often reveal way more than they intended.

FBI negotiators use this constantly. Chris Voss talks about it in “Never Split the Difference” (the dude literally negotiated with terrorists for a living; this book is insane for understanding human psychology). He calls it ""tactical empathy"", but really, it's weaponised silence. People will confess, elaborate, or backtrack just to escape the tension.

Try it in your next salary negotiation. State your number, then shut up. Whoever speaks first usually loses.

Step 2: The Foot-in-the-Door Technique (Getting People to Say Yes)

This one's backed by solid research, and it's almost stupid how well it works. You want someone to agree to something big? Start by getting them to agree to something tiny first.

Ask your roommate to help you move one box, not the whole apartment. Once they've said yes to the small thing, they're way more likely to help with the bigger task because humans hate cognitive dissonance. We want to see ourselves as consistent. If I helped you with one box, I must be a helpful person, so I'll help with more boxes.

Robert Cialdini breaks this down in **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion**. Dude's research at Arizona State basically created the blueprint for every marketing campaign you've ever seen. The book reads like a manual for understanding why you bought that thing you didn't need. Fair warning, though, after reading it, you'll see these tactics everywhere, and it's kinda creepy.

This works in dating, sales, friendships, everywhere. Start small. Build momentum.

Step 3: Mirroring (Become Their Psychological Twin)

Your brain is wired to like people who are similar to you. It's tribal instinct stuff. So when someone mirrors your body language, speech patterns, or energy level, your subconscious reads them as ""one of us"" and drops its guard.

Here's how to do it without being obvious: Match their speaking pace. If they talk slowly and thoughtfully, you slow down too. If they're animated and loud, bring your energy up. Subtly mirror their posture after a 2-3 second delay. Cross your legs when they cross theirs. Lean back when they lean back.

The research on this is wild. Studies show that waiters who mirror customers get bigger tips. Negotiators who mirror body language close more deals. It creates this subconscious rapport that words alone can't achieve.

But don't be a robot about it. The keyword is subtle. You're not doing a mime performance.

Step 4: Strategic Vulnerability (The Pratfall Effect)

Here's something that sounds backwards but works like magic: Showing small, controlled weaknesses makes people trust you more.

It's called the Pratfall Effect. Psychologist Elliot Aronson discovered that highly competent people who make small mistakes are actually rated as MORE likeable than those who appear perfect. Your brain sees perfection as threatening or fake. But someone who's mostly got their shit together AND admits they burned dinner or forgot someone's name? That person feels real.

The trick is strategic. You're not trauma dumping or showing major character flaws. You're showing minor, relatable imperfections that humanise you. ""I'm terrible with names"" or ""I always forget to water my plants"" makes you approachable while maintaining competence.

Politicians use this constantly. CEOs do it in interviews. Even your favourite podcaster probably deploys this without thinking about it.

Step 5: Anchoring (Control the Frame of Reality)

Your brain is lazy. When it encounters new information, it grabs onto the first number or piece of data it sees and uses that as a reference point for everything else. This is called anchoring, and once you see it, you can't unsee it.

Want to sell something? Start with a high anchor. ""This usually goes for $500, but I'm offering it for $250."" Even if $250 is the actual value, people will perceive it as a deal because you anchored them at $500.

Salary negotiations? Never give your number first if you can avoid it. But if forced, anchor high. If you want $80k, say $95k. Now $80k feels like a compromise, and they feel like they won.

Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize partly for his work on this stuff. “Thinking, Fast and Slow” is the book, but heads up, it's dense as hell. Worth it though. You'll understand how your brain constantly tricks you into bad decisions.

Step 6: Reciprocity Weaponised
 
Do something for someone, and they'll feel psychologically obligated to return the favour. It's hardwired. Anthropologists think reciprocity is one of the foundations of human civilisation.

But here's the dark part: The favours don't have to be equivalent. You buy someone a coffee, and they feel obligated to help you move. You give someone unsolicited advice, thand they feel like they owe you something.

This is why free samples work. Why sales salespeople bring you water during a pitch? Why cults lovebomb new members with overwhelming kindness. The recipient feels debt.

Use this ethically. Do genuine favours without keeping score. But understand that when someone does you an ""unsolicited favour there might be strings attached.

Step 7: The Illusion of Choice

Give people options, but frame them so all choices lead wheto re you want. Parents do this with kids. ""Do you want to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?"" The kid feels autonomous, but going shirtless was never an option.

Salespeople do this constantly. ""Would you prefer the premium package or the standard?"" Notice how ""neither"" wasn't offered as a choice.

Frame your requests as choices between two yeses instead of yes or no. ""Should we meet Tuesday or Thursday?"" beats ""Want to meet up?"" The first assumes the meeting will happen and just negotiates details.

Step 8: Scarcity and FOMO (Fear Runs the Show)

Limited time. Only 3 left. Exclusive access. Your brain's threat detection system goes haywire when resources appear scarce. Even if you don't want something, scarcity makes you want it.

Every marketing campaign uses this because it works. But you can use it too. When setting boundaries, make your time or attention appear limited. ""I can only meet for 30 minutes"" makes people value that time more than ""I'm free all day.""

But real talk, if you're using scarcity to manipulate people into bad decisions, you're just being an asshole. Use it to protect your actual limited resources.

Resources for Going Deeper

If this stuff clicks and you want to keep learning, there are some solid resources that'll take you further down the rabbit hole.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by former Google engineers that turns books, research papers, and expert interviews into personalised content. You type in what you want to learn, like improving negotiation skills or understanding dark psychology, and it pulls from high-quality sources to create custom podcasts for you. 

The depth control is clutch. Start with a 10-minute overview of a book like Influence or Never Split the Difference, and if it hooks you, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. You can pick different voices too; some are weirdly addictive, like this smoky tone that makes dense psychology research way easier to absorb during commutes. The app also builds an adaptive learning plan based on your goals, so it's structured instead of random.

Books worth the time: “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss is street-level tactical. Influence by Cialdini is the research bible. “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Kahneman is dense but rewarding. “The 48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene, if you want the full Machiavelli experience.

These tactics work because they exploit how human psychology actually functions, not how we wish it worked. Silence creates pressure. Small agreements lead to big ones. Mirroring builds unconscious rapport. Strategic vulnerability increases trust. Anchoring controls perception. Reciprocity creates obligation. False choices guide decisions. Scarcity triggers fear responses.

The thing is, knowing this stuff is defensive as much as offensive. You'll start noticing when car salesmen use anchoring on you. When your boss uses scarcity to pressure you. When dating apps use variable rewards to keep you swiping.

Use these wisely. Or don't use them at all. But at least now you know when someone's using them on you.",1,1767669150.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Scopolamine is one of the most common psychoactive substances used in Medellín and Colombia to commit crimes such as theft, abuse, or even rape. Recently, cities like Medellín have been the scene of several cases of robbery involving scopolamine. According to the Medellín Security Secretariat, 94 people have been victims of this crime. *modus operandi.*

This is a psychoactive substance derived from the Brugmansia plant genus, also known in Colombia as ""borrachero"" or ""cacao sabanero."" These trees, which grow in the Antioquia region and the coffee-growing belt, are small shrubs that reach heights of 3 to 11 meters and are considered highly toxic due to their content of tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine.

According to teachers and researchers from the School of Medicine of the Universidad CESThe substance is known as a drug of submission. If administered to someone, they can be rendered helpless, unable to control themselves and forced to obey the perpetrator's orders. This has been exploited to commit crimes such as theft, abuse, and rape in Colombia.

This substance is often mixed with benzodiazepine, a medication used in medicine to relax, induce sleep, relieve pain from muscle spasms, or calm anxiety attacks. This is done so that the victim will more easily give in to orders and submit to the other's will.

The perpetrator can administer the substance orally, inhaled, or injected. Another way is through skin contact, but this would require very high doses. Even so, those who come into contact with scopolamine don't get high and can exploit the victim.

*""The most common routes of administration are oral, where the perpetrator scrapes the substance and pours it into a glass of drink. Another route is inhalation, which can be done through vaporizers, or injection, where a brief prick with a small needle can get you high.""*, commented Dr. Guillermo Alonso Castaño Pérez, coordinator of the Master's Degree in Drug Addiction at the Universidad CES.

For the specialist, it's important to be alert and understand a little about how the effects begin and how criminals act in order to know how to proceed in these situations. If you're in an environment where there's alcohol, you have to be careful, because if you're careless, the substance could be slipped into the drink you're drinking. Initial symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, mydriasis (dilated pupils), psychomotor agitation, or a feeling of disorientation.

*""There are apps to alert close friends and family if you feel in danger or exposed. It's essential to be prepared because after having this substance in your body, you can be left in a vulnerable state that can only be fully recovered from within 48 to 72 hours.""*, said Castaño Pérez.

Scopolamine can trigger certain disorders and illnesses if the victim is predisposed to it. For example, the patient may develop a psychotic condition or, in the long term, anxiety disorders, depression, or even schizophrenia. They may also experience memory problems, cardiovascular problems, and metabolic and kidney disorders. However, this depends on the patient's health, the amount of the substance administered, and other factors.

The recommendation if you find a helpless person is to secure them in a quiet place and be alert for their symptoms. If they display disorientation or disturbance, they should be taken to the nearest hospital emergency room so they can receive appropriate treatment. The most common procedure is gastric lavage when the substance is administered orally, and treatment with other drugs to prevent complications.

The U.S. Embassy informs U.S. citizens that in the last year, the Embassy has seen an increase in reports of incidents involving the use of sedatives to drug and rob individuals.  Foreigners are routinely targeted through online dating applications or in bars and nightclubs.  The Embassy regularly receives reports of these types of incidents occurring in major cities, including Medellin, Cartagena, and Bogota.  Some of these incidents have resulted in victims dying or needing serious medical assistance as a result of an overdose from the drugs used to incapacitate the victim. 

One of the most popular methods to target unsuspecting individuals is through online dating applications.  Individuals match with dates and there is an agreement to meet.  This meeting can either initially start in a public place or at the residence/hotel of the victim.  Eventually, a sedative is introduced to the victim, leaving them disoriented and sedated so they are easily robbed.  These types of crimes are believed to be underreported as victims are embarrassed and do not want to follow through with the judicial process, especially if they are tourists.  

Historically in Colombia, a drug called scopolamine has been used to carry out these crimes.  Also known as Burundanga in Colombia, it is an odorless, tasteless, memory blocking substance used to incapacitate and rob unwary victims.  If ingested or exposed, scopolamine can render a victim unconscious up to 24 hours or more.  In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death.  It is most often administered in liquid, spray, or powder form in foods and beverages.  Other drugs used in Colombia include benzodiazepines that can render a person unconscious.  In one recent case, the assailant used zolpidem (brand name: Ambien), a non-benzodiazepine sedative used commonly to treat insomnia.  These types of drugs can cause extreme effects and leave the victims defenseless. ",1,1767669118.0,scopolaminedrugvictim,0,1.0,False

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important thing is that I stay grounded for the people I care about. I live a sort of quiet life, with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A perfect relationship for me is one where we support each other and still know how to play and tease. If we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen. We can spend our time enjoying our hobbies, co-oping games, or going out on calm but fun dates like cafés or arcades. A night just cuddled up on the couch laughing or enjoying each other's presence is perfect to me.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she enjoys. I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I’m most drawn to a cute, girl next door type: expressive eyes, a warm smile, and a slim or active build. Not some perfect model, but not just anyone. I fall for someone who is kind to others, is loyal to the ones she loves, and is just as picky as I am on who she lets into her life.

A side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming to cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're my type. If you've got other ideas, feel free to say them. Yeah, we'll be the couple that gets others inspired.

Indiana based, open to long-distance in USA only for now. Only interested in a long-term relationship for dating, not into anything casual. Preferably around age 20-27. We can swap pics early to see if there's a spark. If we're nearby, let's plan a coffee date and see where it goes.

1q570j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q570j8/fractal_indifference/,Fractal Indifference,"Darkness crept over the horizon, erasing the view more and more with each breath. Jack Buchannan took it in, awestruck as always. For three generations the Buchannans had been the keepers of this land. Life times of struggle and strife had built it to what it now was; thirty thousand acres of corn, cotton, and cattle. Every inch blessed by God. Every inch hallowed ground. 

Jack sat on his old Ford tractor and almost shed a joyous tear. Almost.

Down the valley a piece, Something drug his attention away. As the night stretched on, closing in on him, he saw *it*. Whatever it was, it was moving real fast straight towards him. Wolves had been gone from these parts for decades. Coyote? Maybe. Then again, maybe it was some kids from town. Supper was going to have to wait. No one messed with Buchannan land. No one.  

In a few short heartbeats, Jack threw the tractor into motion and drew his pistol from its holster. Behind him, guarded only by three strands of barbed wire, his main herd idled. He had to keep them safe. 

Night now fell like a blanket of uncertainty, eating every bit of clarity he had. Two summers ago, on a night much like this, he had turned the tractor over while trying to move the herd. The headlights had shattered. Town was forty five minutes out of his way and the Ace closed at 7p.m. 

“Damnit,” he thought, not for the first time. He should have replaced the lights.

Up ahead, and closing fast, the shape seemed to grow. What was once a small shape no taller than the cotton it ran in, now seemed to be a hulking *thing,* towering over the reedy plants.

Jack pressed in the clutch, bringing the tractor to a manageable speed. As he slowed down to a stop, he braced himself and aimed. Fear lanced through his mind. 

*What am I looking at?* he thought. The shape kept changing. Small then big. Long now short. Fat, skinny, fast, faster. It made no sense. He shook his head and took a deep breath.

100 yards. He had to wait till it was closer.

75 yards. Sweat seemed to pour from his hands.

50 yards. He thought he could see some jagged mouth where the head should be.

25 yards. He clicked the safety off and squeezed.

**BANG!**

Jack saw stars, then nothing at all.

Back at the top of the hill, eight hundred head of cattle bellowed simultaneously, then wandered off. The old tractor kept drifting forward.

\---

Jack sat up in a rush. His lungs pumped hard, filling him with cold air as fear flooded his veins. It was bright, like looking into the hot sun while working the land.  He blinked rapidly as everything came into focus.

He was… in his bedroom.

*What on earth?*

He grabbed his clock and tugged it towards him. The wire snagged, sending his bible and pocket knife clattering to the floor.

11:43 a.m. That couldn’t be right, there was no way he slept that long. Yet, when he looked out his window, it seemed far too true. The sun was already high enough to bleach the thin curtains pale, yet there were no flies at the window, no cattle lowing in the distance, no wind worrying the cotton. His bedroom smelled wrong, too. Not of dust and oil and old wood, but of something thin and sharp, like rain that never quite fell.

His head was killing him, his joints ached, and his chest felt tight. He stumbled to the bathroom and washed his face. The water was ice cold. When he looked in the mirror, everything was blurry. He rubbed his eyes, but nothing changed. Looking around, everything else was clear.

*I’ve gone and lost my mind.*  
No, not lost it. Misplaced it.

The cows needed to be moved today, and it was surely noon now. He had broken his father’s golden rule. Never sleep in when there is work to do.

Hurriedly, he left the house. At the edge of the yard, where the fence began, he froze. The cows were gathered in strange clusters. Three huddled close to the fence, then a patch of seven farther off, another three nearer still, forming a rhythm he could not make sense of. They never came this close to the house. He took a step forward, then another, squinting at the unusual pattern.

Perplexed but set in his ways, Jack shouted, sending the cows further into the field. They moved reluctantly, glancing back at him in a way that made his stomach twist. All obeyed, eventually, but it felt like forcing a river uphill.

When he reached the barn, he stopped short. The tractor, his old Ford parked just as he had left it last night, was gone. He rubbed his eyes again, heart thudding. Empty space. He had stored it away last night, when…

A low, resonant bellow rolled across the pasture. The sound pressed against his skull, unnatural in rhythm and tone. His headache throbbed, spreading down his neck. The cows bellowed again, a chorus that did not sound right, that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Jack swallowed hard. Something was very wrong.

The cows had stopped, once again bunching up. Jack tried to count them but couldn’t make sense of it. Every time he started, the numbers slipped from his mind. 

Jack stepped forward, trying again to separate the cows. His boots sank slightly into the soft earth, though it had rained only yesterday. Each step felt heavier than it should. The clusters shifted slightly as he moved, reforming into patterns he could not comprehend. He tried to count them. One, two, three… the numbers vanished from his mind as quickly as he thought them.

The wind whispered across the field, thin and sharp, carrying a sound he could not name. The horizon did not look right. Hills he had crossed a hundred times seemed farther away, stretched unnaturally, as if the land itself had grown taller while he slept. He rubbed his eyes, but the stretch remained.

And then he heard it again. Not the bellowing, but a faint vibration beneath his feet, steady, almost deliberate. Jack froze. The world was watching him now, he was sure of it. In the corner of his vision, a dark shape appeared. When he turned to look, it was gone. Yet again he turned to the cows, but the shape bloomed back in his peripheral vision. 

He tried once more to focus on it, but a wave of nausea rolled through him. His stomach clenched hard. His mouth filled with something thick and bitter. He staggered, bent double, and retched onto the ground.

For a long moment he stayed there, shaking, spitting, trying to clear the taste from his mouth. When he finally straightened, his head was pounding, his legs weak, and the shape was gone.

Only the land remained. Watching.

\---

Jack’s eyes shot open. A surge of anxiety jolted him upright, tangling him in the comforter as he slid off the edge of the bed.

He freed himself with a heavy breath and sat on the mattress. The clock read 6:15 a.m. That seemed right. Out his window, he saw the faint morning light painting the land. A bird sang somewhere nearby. The branches of his favorite oak tree swayed in a breeze. 

He felt… better.

Jack made his way to the bathroom and washed his face. When he looked in the mirror, his own tired face looked back. It was clear and focused.

He let out a sigh and walked lightly to the kitchen. Coffee brewed on the counter, and the warm, familiar smell perked him up a bit more.

Jack carried his mug to the back door and stood there for a moment, letting the warmth soak into his hands and the familiar smells of coffee and old wood and morning air settle him. The pale light through the window had the same quiet promise it always had, the sort that made work feel possible again.

He opened the door.

The breeze he had seen in the oak tree did not reach him. The leaves still moved, whispering softly to one another, but the air against his face was perfectly still, heavy and unmoving in a way that made him pause before stepping forward.

When he stepped onto the porch, the boards did not creak beneath his weight. That should have been impossible. This house sang with every footstep. He shifted, deliberately this time, pressing his heel down, then his toes, but the wood did not answer him. The mug was warm in his hands. The railing was solid beneath his fingers. Only the sound was missing, and the faint, unreasonable certainty that something about that mattered.

“Morning,” he murmured, more out of habit than expectation.

His voice felt swallowed before it finished leaving his mouth. He went down the steps and into the yard, and it was only then that he noticed the grass did not move around his boots. The blades brushed his ankles, cool and sharp, but they did not bend, did not part, did not show any sign that he had passed through them at all. He stopped and crouched, pressed his hand flat against the green and felt its texture clearly beneath his palm. When he lifted his hand, nothing rose with it. The grass had not been pressed.

A slow unease began to coil in his chest. He straightened and looked toward the pasture.

The cows were still there, scattered along the fence in their strange, uneven groupings, their sides rising and falling as they breathed. He raised a hand and waved, then lifted his voice and called out, the way he had a thousand times before, but no heads turned. No ears flicked. It was as if the sound had never reached them.

He picked up a small stone and tossed it between two of them. It disappeared into the grass beyond without so much as a startled twitch.

The perplexity of it all left him hollow. He made his way to the barn, each step dragging like a thousand. His heartbeat quickened, and the rhythm of it seemed to spill outward, threading into the world itself. Every footfall matched an invisible pulse. Every breath raised the crescendo, and for a fleeting moment he felt as though the land itself was moving with him, not around him.  

The barn loomed in front of him, seeming to swell with his heart and lungs. The wood pulsed, growing and stretching to extreme proportions. As he stumbled forward, the doors opened by themselves. Inside, his tractor sat running. The headlights were on, shining directly in his eyes, though the engine smelled faintly of ozone instead of oil

*I… when did I?...*

The engine’s humming invaded his every sense, its vibration pitching in time with the rhythm that seemed to surround him. A pulsing headache bloomed behind his eyes, and shapes, impossible and shifting, unfolded in his vision as if the world itself were bending inside his skull.

Jack’s vision sharpened instead of blurring. The pain behind his eyes drew tight, not like a wound but like a lens being turned into focus, and the world shifted with it. The barn no longer held a single shape. Its walls layered over themselves, boards overlapping boards that were not there a moment before, angles folding into angles that should not have fit. The space inside it felt deeper than its outside allowed, a hollow that opened inward rather than containing.

The tractor’s headlights shone forward and backward at once. The beams did not stop at the far wall but slid through it into something that was not darkness but depth.

Lines ran everywhere. Through the dirt floor, through the walls, through the tractor’s metal frame, through his own hands and arms. Some were thick, some thin, some vibrating so fast they were only a shimmer, all crossing and bending and tangling through one another in patterns that made his stomach tighten and his breath come shallow.

Not the surfaces he had always known, not the shapes he named and trusted. This was a structure that held everything in place. The very reality or existence around him.

“Holy Christ!” he screamed. Nothing felt real. His stomach turned to lead.  

Jack swayed on his feet, one hand braced against the tractor’s hood. The metal felt wrong now, too warm and too distant at the same time. The engine’s hum no longer sounded like sound. It was a pressure that moved through him, a vibration that matched something deeper than his ears, something that seemed to run through his bones and into the ground beneath him.

He lifted his head.

Where many the lines converged, something stood.

It was not a shape in any way he could name. It had no clear edge, no surface, no form that stayed consistent from one moment to the next.

It had been in the field. It had been in the barn. It had been beneath his feet since the moment he woke. The thing did not turn toward him in any way that space could describe, but he felt its attention settle on him all the same, like a change in pressure. Hairs rose on his neck as he felt the world turn to him.

Jack took a step back.

The space behind him did not behave as it should have. The barn stretched away instead of receding. The floor did not carry him so much as slide beneath him, and the distance he tried to create did not feel like distance at all, but like an adjustment. He couldn't make progress.

He swayed a moment before falling to the floor. The lines tightened. He felt like he was floating, carried through the world in a mist he couldn’t see.

The thing did not move closer. It did not need to.

His heart hammered, and with each beat the world seemed to answer, a subtle tightening and release that ran through the barn, through the land beyond it, through the air and the ground and the sky above.

His breath came in shallow gasps. The pressure in his skull built higher and higher, images tumbling through his brains. Curves without radius, angles that bent inward on themselves, depths that opened in places that should have been flat. His hands trembled.

The thing’s presence deepened. Not closer. Clearer.

Jack cried out, though he did not hear the sound. The lines did not fade. The world did not return.

He was still inside the barn when his eyes felt like they ruptured. Brilliant colors exploded across every surface.

The *thing* drew closer, until all the colors vanished. All that existed was black.

It was all black.

\---

Jack opened his eyes. There was no light, no darkness. There just *was.*

Bands of deep purple swirled with emerald green. Pinks and yellows converged and dissipated. Shapes flowed between it all, bending and breathing with him.

He lay there, taking it all in. Not because he chose to, but movement was all the same. He was both there and not. 

He rose with nothing but a thought. The light bent to his will and folded around him. He walked out what was once his front door. Patterns greeted him, all in varying degrees of intricacy.

we got new office room and the new environment feels too strange to me it made me uncomfortable also i sit in front of my manager i feel watched all the time i feeeel siiiiiick. i thought today will be smooth, just me sitting on my desk, merging some PR and go home, but nope i feel sick at 1pm feeling like wanna vomit the entire time. we had sprint planning meeting at 4pm and i mispronounced “Text “ as “Sex” in front of 20 people. and hour later i got text from my ex coworker saying her office currently full wfh and im so fucking jealous i wanna die

and you know what worse? i’ll be going back home to my well tended apartment, recently cleaned before christmas during my long holiday, and smells like pine tree scented candles. this is also a new thing, because in the past i always come back to a messy dirty apartment with tons of dirty clothes on the floor and dishes that haven’t been washed for months, and my nasty apartment gave me comfort somehow. i know clean apartment is a good thing and i should be happy to finally improve mentally and cleaning up is a great first leap but i have this unreasonable dread of coming home to something that is not usually familiar to me. everytime i see that clean apartment it reminds me of the long PTO days where i was happy and controlled which i no longer have. it feels like i should come back to the usual messy dirty apartment to feel like myself again, to feel like i belong. this is such a strange irrational feelings.

i feel pretty normal this morning. i woke up at 6, had good breakfast, hot black coffee and lofi music playing on my tv, after breakfast i read The Wild Sheep Chase for 30 minutes, then journaling, i wrote my agenda for the day, do my work, go home, eat dinner, read a book, but now at the end of the day after going through the actual day job i feel sick physically sick and nauseous at the idea of doing all that agenda it’s like my body telling me “this is not who you are what the hell you think you doing?” it’s like my body refuse to change it refuses novelty and growth it made me feel physically sick.

right now im at the bathroom stall still at my work despite the work been over hours ago. i just sit here next to the toilet bowl vaping. i don’t feel like wanna go home maybe i should wait a bit until i feel better. i wanna walk somewhere to get fresh air and clear my mind but my body is too tired to walk while carrying 5kg laptop bag.

i think i stayed at this tiny bathroom stall because it’s my safe space. it’s the place i always go to when i need a bit of freedom. it knows how messy and fucked up i am. this place knows that i cannot “change” and will stay as the same old me. i eat my lunch here, read here, cried here, nap here, draw and write here, the only place i can safely escape to, this stall is mine, this stall accepted everything that wrong with me while my clean apartment doesn’t, i feel like this is the kind of place i belong to. now that my messy apartment is gone, this public bathroom is the only one left for me.

but i don’t like it here, staying here meaning there’s nothing change about me despite the attempt of reinventing myself during my PTO days i feel quickly reverted back into that bathroom stall dweller i feel like if i die i’d probably haunt this particular stall LMAO. i wanna go home but not to that place i wanna go home where i can be messy and failing without the place reminding myself of who i was few days ago.

nothing is actually that stressful happening with my work tbh and i’m probably being a dramatic emotional human immobilized in my office bathroom stall at 9pm i just feel overwhelmed with having to start on this old yet entirely new routine. i’m scared of change but i want to change myself and the way i view my work i want to be normal and functioning and better than last year but it’s just ended up making me sick.

i wanna go home, drop my stuff on the floor because fck tidy apartment, and take benzo and sleep but i can’t leave this bathroom stall yet, i don’t feel safe yet.",1,1767668675.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

Happy new year!

I have been using my picopresso for about 1 year to create great espresso using the method below. I recently moved and started up again. 

  
Method: 

0. Preheat the unit by pouring boiling hot water (after the kettle turns off) into the unit.

1. 14, 15, or 16 grams of whole bean coffee ([this kind](https://www.eightoclock.com/products/eight-oclock-coffee-dark-italian-espresso-whole-bean?variant=52860685025644)). The coffee has remained consistent (just a newer bag since I moved) 

2a. Grind on 7, 8, or 9 clicks from zero on the Tinemore Chestnut C2 

2b. Put grinds into the basket with the funnel.  

3. Use the distributor tool to ""swirl it around"" in the funnel 

4. Tamp with the funnel still on, remove the funnel, tamp again very lightly. 

5. Setting the basket aside, pump out the preheat water into the sink 

6. Insert the basket and refill the water tank 

7. Pump 11 times, wait 10 seconds (a small amount of droplets appear on the basket holes furthest from the center of the basket) 

8. Pump fully into the cup. 

  
Since I have not been able to produce a good crema (after I moved), I noticed that when pumping fully into the cup, there's been a lot less resistance to the pumping motion; I can basically pump it with one hand with hardly any exertion. Before I moved and when I was making good crema, the unit routinely required two hands and an even pumping motion lasting about 1 second per pump.

""Let me take a look; perhaps it can still be saved."" In my view, this situation might have nothing to do with the content, the product, or even the domain name.

After taking over, I didn't change the product, switch the domain, or run any ads. I focused on doing just one thing: **rebuilding the underlying logic of search traffic.**

Three months later, the Google Search Console data showed: **3.75 million impressions, 151,000 clicks, and an average ranking of 7.5.** 

[3.75M impressions, 151K clicks](https://preview.redd.it/y6el96nc5nbg1.jpg?width=2298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef59fb23e2a035e5c07b59565624f5a9c5c945eb)

Today, I am sharing the complete review and a replicable process. If you are struggling with whether to abandon your small site, give this a try—it might just be the lifeline you need. 



# Part One: Keyword System Construction (The Starting Point for Everything)



❌ Most people fail at SEO not because their content is poor. ❌ But because the keywords they choose from the start are**""destined not to rank.""**

**Core Principle (Mindset First)**

The goal is not to ""find keywords,"" but to **""build a keyword system.""**

A healthy keyword system must simultaneously satisfy the following:

* Keywords for **rapid initial volume** (quick wins).
* Keywords for **mid-term scaling** (traffic amplification).
* Keywords for **long-term traffic dividends** (market dominance).



**Step 1: Start with the ""Demand Pool,"" Not the Tool**

Before touching any tool, I do one thing: List the**five categories of questions** that users genuinely search for: 

* **What is/How does** (Informational: What is / How does)
* **How to** (Informational/Navigational: How to)
* **Comparison** (Commercial Investigation: X vs Y / Best X)
* **Problem/Solution** (Informational/Transactional: Why / Fix / Error)
* **Decision-Making** (Transactional: Pricing / Alternative / Review)



This step determines whether you unearth **""keywords with click value""** or **""keywords no one clicks on.""**



**Step 2: Bulk Keyword Mining (Don't Rely on Just One Tool)**

**Method 1: Google Keyword Planner (Free, Quick-Volume Generator)**

Specific Process:

Open Google Keyword Planner ([ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com/) → Tools → Keyword Planner).

[Google Keyword Planner](https://preview.redd.it/mctx9toh5nbg1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=785f62aa6f2c14fe9e560990cb5b4894d3df5a74)

Input **action-oriented core terms**.

❌ **Avoid** generic terms like ecommerce.

✅ **Use** terms like build online store / start ecommerce website.

Export all keywords.

*Why avoid generic terms?* Because the data Google provides for generic terms is from an ""advertising perspective,"" which is often irrelevant for SEO.

 

**Method 2: Google Suggest + People Also Ask (Often Overlooked)**

This is my key method for filling in long-tail keywords:

Search the main keyword on Google.

Record:

* **Auto-complete (Suggest):** I recommend a tool like [https://keywordtool.io/](https://keywordtool.io/) to generate a large number of related search suggestions from various platforms' auto-complete data.
* **People Also Ask (PAA)**
* **Related Searches** at the bottom of the page.



These keywords share a common trait: **They have been searched by real users, and the search intent is highly explicit.** 

[find backlink](https://preview.redd.it/938vcker5nbg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e9366315bf7c4229abc783ab908a7783a92e06)

[people also search for](https://preview.redd.it/cnrft2qs5nbg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f9c3ec55ba2f53570dea569169cd1a6d3e73a6)



**Method 3: Competitor Keyword Reverse Engineering (Highest Efficiency)**

Use Semrush → Input competitor domain.

Go to Organic Keywords → Filter by:

* Position **6–20**
* Search Volume **≥ 100**



What do these keywords indicate? They show that**""Google has already recognized this content structure, but the 'optimal solution' has not yet been achieved.""** This is your opportunity.

 

**Method 4: Semrush Keyword Magic Tool**

This is a highly efficient method for bulk generation, classification, and filtering of keywords:

* Open Semrush → Keyword Magic Tool.
* Input core term (action-oriented or demand-oriented).



Classify by intent or topic:

* **Informational** (Information-seeking)
* **Commercial** (Commercial investigation)
* **Transactional** (Ready to buy/act)



Set filters for Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty (KD):

* Search Volume **≥ 100**
* KD **≤ 40** (Easier to rank initially)

 

**Step 3: Keyword Screening Criteria (Don't Just Look at Search Volume)**

Many people fail at SEO by only screening keywords based on search volume. My method is the **Four-Dimensional Screening Method**, where each dimension has specific operational standards.

https://preview.redd.it/soujrfty5nbg1.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0b659eccdd628bab294361d6920cee3b0625e4

**Practical Tip for SERP Analysis:**

Search using **incognito mode** to avoid personalized results.

Tally the proportion of result types in the top 10.

Note the title, description, and URL types to determine if your content has an entry point.

If the top 10 results are all large e-commerce sites or high-authority brands, it indicates difficulty in ranking quickly. Place these keywords in the mid-to-long-term observation list.

 

**Step 4: Keyword Layering (The ""Crucial Point"")**

**KD 15–25 (Month 1):** **Rapid ranking** → Send positive signals to Google.

**KD 25–35 (Month 2):** **Amplify traffic** → Establish topical authority.

**KD 35–45 (Month 3):** **Compete for industry terms** → Capture scale dividends.

 

The sequence is critical. If you mix up the order, a new site can easily **""fail to break through.""**

 

**Final Deliverable:** An Excel spreadsheet with fields including:

* Keyword
* Search Volume
* KD
* Intent
* Corresponding Page Type



# Part Two: Competitor Analysis (Not Copying, but ""Finding Flaws"")



The core goal of competitor analysis is to **find areas that they have already validated but haven't executed perfectly**, and then precisely target those gaps.

**Step 1: Selecting the Right Competitors (Where 90% of People Go Wrong)**

❌ **Do not** choose industry giants. 

✅**Choose** sites with a similar Domain Authority (DA) **and** existing organic traffic.

**Standard Operating Procedure:**

* **Tool Selection:** Semrush / Ahrefs / Moz.



**Candidate Selection:**

* DA is within **±10** of yours.
* Ranking for **≥ 1,000** keywords.
* Traffic source aligns with your target market.



**Data Validation:** Check their homepage/blog/product page traffic and confirm that their ranking keywords cover your planned core topics.

**Final Screening:** Select **3–5** competitors for in-depth analysis.

 

**Step 2: Deconstruct Content Structure, Not Just Word Count**

**Goal:** Be **""more useful""** than them, not just longer.

**Operational Process:**

* Open the top 10 competitor pages for your target keyword.



**Deconstruct the content structure:**

* H1/H2/H3 hierarchy.
* Paragraph length, formatting, images, tables, diagrams.
* CTAs, downloadable resources, FAQs, case studies



**Step 3: Finding ""Overcomable Points""**

**Formula:** Opportunity = They are already ranking + Their content is not maximized

**Operational Steps:**

**Identify Potential Keywords:**

Ranking **3–5** → Low competitive pressure, significant traffic potential.

Ranking **6–10** → Potential for a quick flip/takeover.

**Compare Content Coverage:**

* Do they have VS / Comparison content?
* Are they missing localization, scenario-specific, or niche audience content?
* Are they lacking in-depth information, charts, case studies, or operational guides?



**List Optimization Solutions:**

* Add comparison tables / FAQs / case studies.
* Scenario-specific examples: localization, industry/audience customization.
* Downloadable resources or interactive tools to enhance user experience.



**Prioritize:**

* Traffic Potential × Ease of Improvement = Priority

 

**Step 4: Backlink Analysis → Determining Where to Get Exposure (Semrush Practical Guide)**

**Goal:** Not to blindly build backlinks, but to find high-value sources that competitors have already leveraged, which you can emulate or optimize.

[Semrush backlinks](https://preview.redd.it/29ong1o56nbg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d7d131f1791ccda84847f3fd5a48094af6acaca)

 **Operational Process:**

* Open Semrush → SEO → **Backlink Gap**.
* Input your domain (**You**).
* Input **1–3** competitor domains.
* Click ""Find Prospects.""



**Analyze Results:**

The page will display three types of backlinks: i.  Links that**both you and competitors have**→ Reference content format or relationship building. ii. Links that**only competitors have**→ This is your potential opportunity. iii. Links that**only you have** → Consolidate your advantage and increase authority.



**Filter High-Value Links:**

* Focus on sources with high DA/traffic and strong relevance.
* Exclude low-quality or spam links.
* Mark as ""Priority Targets"" for outreach.



**Develop an Exposure Strategy:**

For high-value resource pages, industry blogs, and news media: 

▪   Submit content collaboration / guest posts. 

▪   Offer quotable resources or tools.

For social media or forums covered by competitors but not by you: 

▪   Join topic discussions. 

▪   Provide unique insights or case studies.

 

# Part Three: Content Creation



The essence of SEO is not just writing articles; it is **""occupying a topic"" with content.** 

**1. Topic Cluster Construction**

**Goal:** Occupy the entire topic and establish authority.

* List the **Core Topic Terms** (3–5 most important ones).
* Use Keyword Planner / Ahrefs / SEMrush / ChatGPT to expand related **long-tail keywords**.



**Classify by Search Intent:**

* Informational (How to / What is / Guide)
* Comparative (vs / Best / Top)
* Transactional (Buy / Price / Cost)



**Generate a directory tree for each core term:**

**Pillar Page** = Overview + Table of Contents.

**Supporting Pages** = One article for each sub-topic.

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Supporting pages link to the Pillar Page, and the Pillar Page links to supporting pages + mutual cross-linking.

**Tools:** Ahrefs / SEMrush / SurferSEO / Excel for directory tree mapping.

 

**2. Page Role Positioning**

**Goal:** Ensure every page knows its ""identity"" to increase search engine crawl weight.

https://preview.redd.it/c3z1ggu86nbg1.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=75958ed5fb488768bafea9841cafe33463ef1059



**3. AI-Assisted Content Creation**

**Goal:** Efficiently generate structured content while retaining human judgment.

**Outline Generation:**

**Prompt:** Generate an article structure covering What / Why / How / Compare / Mistakes / FAQ.

**Content Filling:**

* AI generates the first draft.
* Human supplements with exclusive data, case studies, and experience summaries.
* Verify logic, SEO keyword coverage, and formatting.



**Supplementing Missing Questions:**

Use PAA / Related Searches / Reddit / Quora / Zhihu (Chinese Q&A platform).

Add new FAQs or sub-topic pages.

**Tools:** ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity + Ahrefs PAA / SurferSEO.

 

**4. Post-Publication Secondary Engineering**

**Goal:** Increase traffic by optimizing existing content rather than just writing new content.

https://preview.redd.it/ojtsliij6nbg1.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2bd3cb993ddef3dea5fe5da45d5d3f7cc1a8542

**Supplementary Tips:**

* Use GA / GSC / Heatmaps to monitor performance.
* High CTR → Retain; Low CTR → Adjust title and meta description.
* Ranking in the top 3 → Expand supporting pages to form a thematic closed loop.

 

# Part Four: Link Building (The Accelerator, Not the Foundation)



**Conclusion first:** More backlinks are not necessarily better. The key is to provide them **""to the right page at the right stage.""** 

I break down backlinks into **4 types + clear purposes**, executed in sequence.

**I. Overall Backlink Strategy**

In this project, the backlink positioning was singular: **to push pages that already have ""potential"" into the top 10 sooner.**

Therefore, any page receiving a backlink must meet at least one of these conditions:

* Already ranking in Google's top 20.
* Has stable impressions.
* Is a core page in a keyword cluster.

 

**Method 1: Resource-Based Backlinks (Most Stable, Controllable, and Most Used)**

This is the most recommended and cost-effective method.

**Step 1: Create a Page ""Worthy of Citation""** **Note:**❌ Not a regular blog post. ✅ A**tool-based / data-driven / compilation-based** page.

Types I have successfully used:

""A Collection of 200 Standalone Website Tools (Categorized by Stage)""

""A Complete Breakdown of Standalone Website Cost Structures for 2024""

""Comparison Table of Common SaaS for the XX Industry""

**The only criterion for judgment:** When someone writes an article, will they find your page useful enough to cite?

 

**Step 2: Precisely Find ""People Who Might Link to You""** I don't search randomly; I use this logic:

**Outreach Formula:**

    site:blog OR site:resources

    keyword + ""tools"" / ""guide"" / ""resources""

Then filter by:

* Content relevance.
* DA ≥ 20.
* Updated within the last 6 months.



This step usually screens out **30–50 highly matched websites.**

 

**Step 3: Backlink Outreach Email** This is the email template I frequently use:

     Hi {{Name}},
     I was reading your article on {{Article Title}} – very solid breakdown.
     I noticed you mentioned {{Tool / Topic}}.
     I recently put together a curated resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
     It includes {{Specific Value Point: quantity / classification / data}}.
    I’ve also referenced a few tools you mentioned.
     If you think it’s useful, feel free to include it as an additional resource.
     Best,
    {{Your Name}}

 

**Method 2: Forum & Community Backlinks**

The core of this method is not ""authority,"" but: **Letting Google see you being mentioned in a real-world context.**

**Step 1: Only Select ""Content-Driven Communities""** Communities I have actually used:

* Reddit (specific subreddits).
* Indie Hackers.
* Industry forums (non-SEO forums).

 

**Step 2: Behavioral Strategy** The rules I set for myself:

* For the first 7 days, only answer questions, do not post links.
* 2–3 high-quality replies per day.



Replies must include:

* Experience
* Judgment



Trade-offs Once the account ""looks like a real person,"" then start: **Only post a link when it is genuinely helpful.**

 

**Method 3: Competitor Backlink Mining (Efficient + Precise)**

The core idea of this method is: **If they link to a competitor, they might link to you too.**

The key is to find highly relevant, high-authority, and genuinely active websites.



**Step 1: Preparation**

Select **3–5** competitor pages ranking in the top 10 (preferably core keyword pages).

Confirm the page type: Resource page / Data page / Tool page / Industry guide.

 

**Step 2: Use Tools to Mine Backlinks** Recommended Tools:

* SEMrush → Backlink Analytics
* Ahrefs (Optional)
* Majestic (Optional)



 **Operational Process:**

* Input the competitor domain or specific URL.
* Filter for effective backlinks (DoFollow / DA≥20 / Content relevance)



Export the list, including:

* Linking source URL.
* Target page (the competitor's page being linked to).
* Page Authority (PA) or similar metric.



**Step 3: Outreach Strategy** The approach is similar to ""Resource-Based Backlinks"":

**Position yourself as a value-add:** Explain that the resource/data you provide is a beneficial supplement for their readers.

**Be specific:** Indicate where they can cite you.

**Do not directly ask for a ""link"";** instead, offer an ""additional reference.""

 

**Email Template Example:**

    Hi {{Name}},
    I was exploring your article on {{Article Title}} and found it super helpful.
    I noticed you referenced {{Competitor / Topic}}.
     I recently published a resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
    It includes {{Specific Value Point: data / tools / classification}}.
    It could serve as an additional reference for your readers.
    Would love to hear your thoughts.
    Best,
    {{Your Name}}

 

**Method 4: Partnerships & Brand Mentions**

This method is suitable for B2B / SaaS / Tool sites like yours.

Find **5–10** upstream and downstream tools/partners.

Proactively suggest:

* Joint content.
* Tool comparisons.
* Use cases. They will typically:
* Mention you on their Blog.
* Mention you in their Help Center.
* Mention you in their Newsletter.



# Part Five: Website Technical Optimization (Technical SEO Audit)



The goal of Technical SEO is to **ensure search engines can smoothly crawl, understand, and index the website, while also improving user experience and page performance.**

No matter how good the content is, if technical issues are not resolved, the ranking will not improve.

**I. Crawl & Indexing**

**Goal:** Ensure all core pages of the website can be crawled and indexed.

**Operational Checklist:**

https://preview.redd.it/btfoe9rq6nbg1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd0dbf3c42c28f4c904153376709c3b18586360

**Tip:** Prioritize the crawling of core Pillar Pages and high-value supporting pages, and avoid wasting crawl budget on low-value pages.

 

**II. Website Performance (Performance & UX)**

**Goal:** Improve page loading speed and mobile experience.

**Operational Checklist:**

1q56shz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1q56shz/desperate_post/,Desperate Post,"Deciding to post here with the hope someone can shed some light and maybe help me get though this hell. Maybe it’ll just be a helpful vent for me, so excuse me if it becomes verbose.

I am chronicling my entire battle here with ‘IBS’ as, unfortunately, it has become a long and strenuous battle. It almost becomes difficult to remember the entire timeline as I enter the new year. I figured it would be prudent to take note of everything that has happened from first symptoms, doctors visits, and medications. Hopefully this will give me sufficient detail to prompt either AI or doctors - honestly still not sure which will provide more help.

I am going to take note of everything, even if it may have nothing to do with my IBS.

Throughout my whole life, ironically I usually had excessive bowel movements and flatulence. Nothing concerning or painful ever, just a reality that I would defecate multiple times a day and fart constantly. In my later years of high school, I noticed I was having some issues with lactose so I started switching from milk to lactose free versions. I would still eat lactose products and feel fine for the most part, so the only lactose I cut out was milk. 
Fast forward into college, and junior year is when I start noticing a little change. I am unsure if this is related, but it definitely didn’t help my health - when I ate within a couple hours of a workout, I found myself puking frequently. At the time I was on the rowing team and the scrunching movement would really upset my stomach and cause me to puke almost daily. Also, at this time I noticed some issues mainly with late night oatmeal. Maybe it was caused by the milk I put in my oatmeal, but I often used oatmeal as a late night snack in college. Oftentimes, after a late night oatmeal snack, I would wake up the next morning with some cramping. I was very reliant on Tums to help my cramping, and they usually did the trick.
Up until this point, I am not sure if anything above is a hint as to my condition, or just red herrings and excess information that is not prudent. It came in my second semester of senior year where the real problems started. The rest of this story or nightmare, whichever you prefer to call it, takes place from January 2025 and onwards.
In late February, I began to notice some constipation issues. I was pooping far less frequently, and far less in general. I didn’t really think it was too much cause for concern, as I usually had the opposite issue as previously mentioned. After a couple weeks of fewer and fewer bowel movements, I began to get slightly concerned. It got to the point where my bowel movements were just pebbles that were difficult to force out. This coincided with my college spring break, where I went out to Colorado for skiing. In Colorado, the constipation had gone from a nuisance to now causing some pain. I finally decided to deal with the cramping, so I stopped at a store in Colorado and picked up some stool softener. I thought this would be the end of the story, and I could just move on, but the stool softener did not fix me. After no success with stool softener, I upgraded to miralax and was still constipated.
Following Colorado, nothing improved. In fact, everything worsened. The constipation continued and the camping became debilitating. It was at this time I realized I had a problem I needed to address. I began hopping on reddit and AI asking for first steps to take. The consensus way to deal with gut issues is through diet. I had taken the obvious steps of restricting products with lactose, but now I began cutting what seemed to be giving me issues. Unfortunately, this seemed to be everything. It got to the point where I was eating spinach and salt, hoping to avoid the debilitating cramps. I of course tried eating more fiber, but this didn’t provide any relief.
It was at this time when I got my first doctor's appointment. My first doctor’s appointment for the gut issues was on April 9, 2025. In this doctor's appointment, I took a GI panel (stool test), urinalysis test, and other miscellaneous tests. Frustratingly, the tests all came back clean, giving me no information. The diet I was currently on had helped slightly, but the cramping was still painful. At this point, I tried booking an appointment with a GI doctor only to find out they were booked out for at least 6 months. Desperate, and with no immediate help in sight, I decided to go to the ER with the hopes of getting tests done and or at least to increase my priority on the GI waitlist. During this time, I was obsessively researching GI issues, convinced I had something along the lines of IBS, Chrons, or some other chronic gut issue. I was trying everything I could find on the internet at this time. Fiber pills, peppermint enteric encoated pills, peppermint tea, probiotics, yogurt, kefir, pickles, ibs pills, tums. You name it, I tried it.

My ER visit came on April 19. In this visit, they ran many of the same tests the previous doctors ran with many of the same results. They also performed an X-Ray scan of my abdomen which came back clean. This was a low point as I had seen all the doctors I could see, and had learned nothing new. However, it was also at this point that I came up with my most likely problem: SIBO. I became convinced I had sibo as many of my symptoms aligned, especially some of the more niche symptoms like I had splotchy red skin at one point. The main symptoms I was experiencing throughout this time were cramping, constipation, feeling like air was trapped, belching. Confident I had Sibo, I went to the PA and requested a SIBO breath test. These symptoms have been constant throughout my journey - especially feeling the need to burp but being unable to. And whenever I am fortunate to either fart or burp, I feel some slight relief.

Despite all my confidence that my symptoms had aligned with SIBO, the test came back negative. I still wasn’t fully convinced I didn’t have it, as my hydrogen peaked within 30 minutes of the breath test which I was told was because the glucose was absorbed so quickly in the small intestine, it could point to my GI issues being in the upper small intestine. 

After even this had failed, I became extra desperate and resorted to something I had heard about - the carnivore diet. On this diet, I consumed only steak and tallow. It was this diet that gave me my first sign of hope. While consuming this diet and a digestive daily probiotic, I started noticing a lessening of symptoms and cramps. Within a couple weeks, I had gone from constipation to wet, frequent stools. Continuing through this, I was momentarily cured. I got through summer having issues, but them being rather minor. Cramping here and there, but nothing debilitating. I noticed coffee and cream would make me cramp the hardest so I gave those up. I was still having issues, but far from what they were in previous months. I came off of all restrictive diets, and was this way for a couple months.

Then I moved, and about a month after moving the symptoms were back and worse than ever. Extreme cramping and just feeling ill after every meal. I tried the carnivore diet again, but this time, it did not provide the same relief. I stayed on it for longer, but did not get the same benefit. After doing carnivore for about a month and still experiencing symptoms, I realized it might have been the probiotic that helped me, not the carnivore. I took the same probiotic (Digestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support Probiotic Capsules) that had previously helped me. This is when something strange happened.

Most of my symptoms went from my stomach to my head. The main problem for me then became debilitating brain fog. Immediately after eating, I would experience immense fog, making it difficult to focus or think. It was also during this time that I finally got in with a GI. He performed a colonoscopy and endoscopy, where he found I was lactose intolerant. I had already assumed this, but it was good to get confirmation. His only other finding was melanosis coli and some mild irritation in the colon. Additionally, the colonoscopy confirmed I don’t have Chron’s or any kind of ulcer colitis. Lastly, they confirmed I don’t have celiac or any gluten intolerance. He said he could treat the mild irritation, but I doubted that could cause all my severe issues.

That takes me to just recently, when I saw a video on SIBO and thought it aligned perfectly with my symptoms. I began herbal treatment for the SIBO, where I noticed some improvement. I think it was the ginger artichoke pills that have been helping me, so I have continued those. I still deal with severe brain fog and some cramps if I eat known bad foods. 

This leads me to now. I am hoping my herbal treatment of SIBO (oregano, berberine, ginger artichoke) can prove helpful as it has already lessened bloating and symptoms, but it doesn't seem to be a cure. The brain fog is the main issue that I have been dealing with lately - feelings of dissociation and drunkeness upon waking up and after eating. The brain fog became so bad I thought I might have histamine intolerance, so I tried taking Famotidine. And this is where I am at today as I continue my struggle with these GI issues.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Feeling like you're running on fumes lately? Or maybe just a little… stuck? We've all been there. That feeling of wishing you had more hours in the day, boundless energy, or just that extra spark of joy to make things feel *good*.

The great news? You don't need a magic wand! You can actively *upgrade* your life, starting right now. It's all about smart optimization, and I wanted to share a few things that have been game-changers for me, and hopefully can be for you too.

Think of your life as a system. Just like a computer or a phone, sometimes it needs a little fine-tuning to run at its best.

Here are some quick hacks to get you started:

*   **Time Blocking Magic:** Seriously, schedule your day. Not just meetings, but *everything*. That workout? Block it. That deep work session? Block it. Even dedicated ""no-distraction"" time. It sounds rigid, but it actually *frees* you up by removing decision fatigue and ensuring what's important gets done.
*   **Energy Auditing:** Where does your energy go? Track it for a few days. Are you spending hours on social media that leave you drained? Are certain conversations a total energy vampire? Identifying these drains is the first step to plugging them and redirecting that precious energy to things that actually fuel you.
*   **Micro-Joy Moments:** Don't wait for a vacation to feel happy. Find joy in the small things. That first sip of coffee. A beautiful sunset. A quick dance break to your favorite song. Actively seeking out and savoring these tiny moments can drastically shift your overall mood and outlook.
*   **Systemize Your Success:** What tasks do you do repeatedly? Can you create a checklist? A template? A simple process? This applies to everything from meal prep to responding to emails. Automating or simplifying these things frees up mental bandwidth and time.

It's not about a complete overhaul overnight. It's about making small, intentional adjustments that compound over time. Think of it as a series of upgrades, each one making your system run a little smoother, a little faster, and a lot more joyfully.

Sometimes, navigating these feelings and making these changes can feel overwhelming. If you're struggling to find your footing or need some extra support as you work on yourself, please know you're not alone.

What are your go-to optimization hacks? I'd love to hear what's working for you in the comments! Let's keep this engine of self-improvement running! 💪✨",1,1767668050.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1q56r0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q56r0m/the_department_of_acceptable_outcomes/,The Department of Acceptable Outcomes,"Arthur Pelts worked in a building that looked like it had been designed by someone trying not to be noticed.

It wasn’t ugly exactly. It was just… apologetic. A tall grey thing with windows that seemed uncertain about being windows, as if they’d been added after someone realised humans needed daylight to survive.

Arthur understood this kind of design. He’d spent most of his life trying not to be noticed either.

The building was home to the Department of Acceptable Outcomes.

The Department did what its name promised: it decided whether the things that happened in the world were acceptable.

Not good. Not fair. Not deserved.

Acceptable.

This was an important difference, though it took Arthur a long time to realise why.

On the seventh floor, in Acceptability Review—Subsection C: Personal Disappointments (Non-Fatal)—Arthur processed the quiet collapses. The kind of collapses that didn’t make the news but did make people stare at ceilings at 2:14 a.m., wondering how they’d ended up with a life that felt like a smaller version of the one they’d pictured.

Arthur had two stamps.

One said: ACCEPTABLE.

The other said: UNFORTUNATE BUT STATISTICALLY EXPECTED.

He used the first one more. Not because it was always true, but because it sounded kinder. And Arthur liked kindness. He liked it the way some people like strong coffee or clean sheets—something necessary, something that made existence feel a little less sharp at the edges.

His desk also had a mug with a cartoon cat clinging to a branch above the words HANG IN THERE.

Arthur didn’t even like cats, but the mug had been a gift, and he had never developed the ability to throw away gifts. He kept them like proof that someone had once thought of him.

Most mornings, Arthur opened case files and did what he was trained to do.

Case 7C-4411.

Denise K., 42. Promotion awarded to someone else. Notes indicated she would smile and say all the right things and then sit in her car and cry so silently that even she might not hear herself.

Arthur stamped ACCEPTABLE, then paused, pen hovering over the paper.

He wasn’t supposed to write anything beyond the stamp. But he did anyway—small, in the margin, like a confession made to a wall.

Still hurts, though.

He closed the file and sent it on, as if it might arrive somewhere that mattered.

The Department believed that naming things made them manageable. That giving disappointment a label was a kind of control. Like putting a wild animal in a cage of language.

Sometimes Arthur believed it too.

Sometimes he didn’t.

On the days he didn’t, he tried to concentrate on the mechanics: open file, read, stamp, close file.

A life reduced to a sequence. A person reduced to paperwork.

It was easier than thinking about the alternative, which was that the Department existed because nobody knew what else to do with the chaos.

At lunch, Arthur often sat opposite Marlene from Subsection F: Minor Joys (Overlooked).

Marlene dealt with things like unexpectedly warm sunlight, finding a forgotten coin in a coat pocket, laughing at a joke that wasn’t even funny, and the relief of a cancelled plan. She treated these events with the seriousness other people reserved for tragedy.

“You look like you’re walking around in someone else’s body,” Marlene said one Tuesday, unwrapping a sandwich that smelled strongly of mustard and determination.

Arthur smiled in a way that didn’t quite make it to his face. “Is that one of your cases?”

“It could be,” she said. “What’s yours?”

Arthur didn’t answer. He didn’t need to. In the Department, silence was a form of disclosure.

Then his phone buzzed with a notification that a new case file had arrived.

He went back upstairs.

At his desk, an envelope waited.

The label made his stomach do something strange, like a lift door dropping half an inch before catching itself.

Case 7C-8890.

Arthur Pelts, 39.

Arthur stared at the words for a long time, as if he could make them rearrange themselves into something else.

He checked the return stamp.

Internal.

That was impossible. Department staff weren’t supposed to appear in the system. You couldn’t be both the judge and the judged. That was the rule. The rule was there for a reason.

Rules, Arthur had always thought, were there to keep reality from leaking in.

He opened the file anyway.

Event: Life feels smaller than promised.
Notes: No single incident. Ongoing condition.

There were attachments. Charts. A graph with a line that dipped gradually, year by year, like enthusiasm draining through a slow puncture.

There was a section titled: Things Arthur Thought Would Happen By Now.

It listed, in neat departmental font:

A sense of purpose

A great love (or at least a vivid one)

A house that felt like home

More laughter

Less fear

Arthur felt the room tilt slightly—not physically, but emotionally, as if the building had shifted to accommodate a truth.

The file wasn’t cruel. That was the worst part. It was calm. Factual. Like a weather report for the soul.

Arthur picked up the ACCEPTABLE stamp.

His hand hovered.

He pictured stamping his own dissatisfaction as acceptable, and something in him recoiled. Not because the Department was wrong. Life was full of disappointments. People did adapt. They did carry on. That was what humans were best at, sometimes to their own detriment.

But it wasn’t just disappointment in the file.

It was a question.

A question that Arthur had spent years avoiding.

Is this it?

He set down the stamp.

He picked up the second stamp—UNFORTUNATE BUT STATISTICALLY EXPECTED—and found he couldn’t lift it.

His hands were suddenly heavy, as though they belonged to someone older.

Then he saw a red pen on his desk. He didn’t remember where it came from. Maybe it had always been there, hiding under forms. Maybe it had appeared because the universe occasionally gave people small tools when they were finally ready to use them.

Arthur uncapped the pen and wrote, across the front page of his own file:

UNRESOLVED

The effect was immediate.

The lights flickered.

The printer beside him began to whine, then spit out blank pages like panic.

Somewhere far above, a phone rang and kept ringing, as if trying to warn everyone about something nobody could name.

Arthur sat very still, red pen in hand, heart pounding the way it did when he was about to do something he couldn’t undo.

Two minutes later, a security guard arrived—not with menace, but with the brisk politeness of someone who had been trained to treat all crises as administrative.

“Mr Pelts,” the guard said, as if they were meeting for coffee. “The Director would like to see you.”

The Director’s office was clean in the way that suggested effort rather than nature. A cleanliness that had been enforced.

The Director looked at Arthur with tired eyes. She didn’t look angry. She looked… worried.

“You can’t do that,” she said softly.

Arthur held the file like a guilty child holding a broken vase. “Why?”

“Because…” The Director exhaled. “Because if things are unresolved, people start to believe they can change them.”

Arthur blinked. “Isn’t that… good?”

“For people,” the Director said.

There was a pause.

“For systems,” she added, “it’s a disaster.”

Arthur thought of all the stamped files. All the quiet griefs made official. All the lives that were told to accept what hurt.

He thought of Denise crying in her car, gripping the steering wheel like it was the only solid thing in her world.

He thought of his own graph, trending down.

The Director slid a form across the desk.

“You have a choice,” she said. “Retract the stamp. Return to your position. We’ll mark this as a momentary lapse.”

“And the other choice?”

“Transfer to Subsection Z.”

Arthur had heard of Subsection Z the way people heard of deep ocean trenches. It existed, but nobody wanted to go there.

“What’s Subsection Z?” he asked, though he already knew.

“Irreconcilable Events,” the Director said. “No stamps. No verdicts. Just… reality.”

“How long do people last there?”

The Director hesitated. “Not long.”

Arthur surprised himself by smiling. “And how do they leave?”

“Different,” she said.

Arthur signed the transfer form.

He went back to his desk, packed his mug, and left the stamps behind.

Down in the basement, Subsection Z had a single whiteboard on the wall. The writing was uneven, like it had been written by someone with a trembling hand, or by someone who had finally stopped pretending.

WHAT HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS UP TO YOU.

Arthur stared at the board for a long time.

He felt fear, yes—because there was no stamp to hide behind, no label to make the world feel settled.

But he also felt something else. Something gentle. Something like air entering a room that had been closed for years.

A kind of permission.

Unresolved didn’t mean doomed.

Unresolved meant alive.

That evening, Arthur walked out of the building and noticed—truly noticed—the sky. It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a movie sky. It was just the sky, doing what it had always done, above a world that kept happening without anyone’s approval.

He thought about all the things he had stamped acceptable.

He thought about the one thing he hadn’t.

And for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel the need to decide what his life was.

He only felt the need to live it.

To do one small thing that might make the graph curve upward again.

Even if only by a fraction.

SLC: winter scenery, snowshoeing/light hiking (Zion), skiing, hot springs, cozy food + coffee. Also we watch Real Housewives of Salt Lake City so visiting iconic places featured on the show.

Hawaii: scuba diving/swimming, whale watching, beaches, warm weather, relaxed pace but rainy season.

We want a low-key, relaxing couples trip (not into nightlife). SLC is closer and easier; Hawaii feels more “vacation”.

1q56oig,https://i.redd.it/a6v1fw618nbg1.png,From Stage 4 Liver Cirrhosis in March 2024 to Normal Liver Tests Today – The Only Change? Daily Espresso,"I wanted to share my personal story because it's blown my mind, and I know a lot of us here are passionate about coffee (especially espresso). Back in March 2024, I was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cirrhosis. It was a huge shock – doctors explained it was advanced scarring, and the outlook wasn't great. At this time, my doctors advised me to start looking into drinking black coffee. I went with the espresso route because as a non-coffee drinker, I could just treat it as a medicine and a shot of espresso pretty quickly.

Fast forward to now (early 2026), and my latest tests show my liver is completely normal. The doctors are stunned, and honestly, so am I. The crazy part? The only lifestyle change I made was starting to drink espresso (and lately pourover) every day – usually 2-3 cups. I got into home espresso around the time of my diagnosis as a way to cope and enjoy something simple. No sugar, no milk, just pure black. I didn't change my diet drastically (although I did lose weight), quit anything else major, or start new meds/supplements specifically for my liver.

I've since read a ton of studies linking coffee (including espresso) to better liver health – lower risk of fibrosis progression, reduced cirrhosis severity, and even slower disease advancement in chronic cases. Science shows compounds in coffee (caffeine, antioxidants like chlorogenic acid) can help reduce inflammation and scarring. But going from stage 4 to ""normal"" just from coffee? It's wild, and I'm not claiming it's a cure-all.

Important disclaimer: This is just my anecdotal experience – I'm NOT a doctor, and I'm not saying coffee alone reverses cirrhosis. Stage 4 is serious and often considered irreversible without treating the root cause (mine was fatty liver, non-alcoholic NAFLD). Always talk to your hepatologist, get proper monitoring, and don't self-treat. Coffee might help support liver health based on research, but results vary hugely.

Curious if anyone else here has heard similar stories or has liver health benefits from their daily ritual? What's your go-to black espresso setup that got you through tough times?

I wanted opinions on if this is machine would be good, people seem to like the Linea Mini R and there are good reviews. And yes, obviously a lot of this is aesthetics. Also curious if anyone has purchased from Coffee Machine Depot and the experiences people have had working with them as well.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

I was scrolling through the podcast description and saw a link to happybumco with a promo code (it's a company that sells 75 dollar coffee enema kits among other things).  I thought that was unusual for a healthcare podcast to have a sponsorship from this sort of alternative medicine company.


I decided to write Erica an email. The company sells other supplements that are more benign (probiotic type stuff) so I assumed maybe she didn't know about the enemas? I even put some sources to support my statements (ya know, like any good little scientist). I was approaching this as a concerned member of the nursing community and tried hard to not sound condescending - I hope it's clear in that original email.


I didn't expect her to absolutely blow up at me and accuse me of gaslighting. Holy shit, projecting much?


This sort of behavior is not okay in the nursing world. She talks about nursing not being taken seriously but she's actively perpetuating the problem on so many levels.

\*\*\*

Bright blue light glowed into the dark room. Yohan sat on the floor doing his nightly stretches half listening to the people on the other end of the Iris message. He was wearing comfy clothes, a loose green mesh tank top, a pair of gray thigh length mesh shorts, and a pair of black calf-hugging socks. He was in the middle of a deep split stretch when something caught his attention. He looked up at the Iris message and frowned.

“Where is Harin hyung? I never see him these days.” Yohan asked, becoming fully upright while he was still in the splits.

On the other side of the call two boys just a bit older than Yohan shared a concerned look. They had a silent conversation in the span of three seconds. The room they sat in was the living room of their small dorm in Seoul. While it was dark in Yohan’s room the light was bright and sunny on their end. The room awash in midmorning sun. The pair then looked back towards Yohan and tried for smiles. They did not look convincing to the son of Terpsichore.

“Oh, he’s just been practicing pretty rigorously. You know how he is.” Jisoo said, waving away Yohan’s concern. Yohan frowned, this was always the response. He wasn’t sure why but he felt like his group members were keeping something from him. Had Harin gotten hurt or something? Yohan needed to know.

“I know how he is, but it doesn’t explain the months of not seeing him. Is he… mad at me or something? Is he hurt? What’s going on?” Yohan asked as he crossed his arms in front of his chest. His legs slowly collected inwards so he would now be sitting cross legged.

Evan shifted uncomfortably, clearly they hadn’t expected Yohan to push back on their lie. Yohan’s frown deepened and he stared down the other boys. Silence. Yohan looked at Jisoo and then shifted to the taller Evan. Then Yohan saw it. A look of guilt flashed across Evan’s face. He was right, something was wrong.

“What aren’t you telling me?” Yohan demanded his voice rising. Yohan could forgive a lot, but lying was a bridge too far. Especially from people he considered to be brothers. Cracks formed in Evan’s stoic facade. Then Jisoo’s face started to show his guilt.

“He’s…” Evan began, Jisoo shushed him quickly. Evan shook his head and pointed at Yohan. “He deserves the truth Jisoo. He’ll find out eventually anyway.”

Jisoo huffed. He looked away from his two other group members. His face was like stone, unrelenting and stoic. But then it softened. “He’s gone Yohan. Without a trace.” He said his voice just above a whisper.

“What do you mean gone? How long? Where did he go?” Yohan yelled at the people on the other side of the Iris Message. He stood and looked at the screen. The stony glare he gave to his friends could cut gems. As Yohan’s voice rose his group members flinched at each word. They clearly hadn’t expected the stoic Yohan to be so animated. No answers came right away. Just silence. “Really? Nothing, not one fucking word?”

“He’s been gone since September and-“ Evan began before Yohan cut him off.

“Since September? Seriously? Four months and you couldn’t say one fucking word to me?” Yohan screamed at the glowing swirl of mist in front of him. A tear escaped his eyes as he quickly wiped it away with the back of his hand. “I… I trusted you. Both of you.” Yohan said wiping at his eyes again as tears threatened to escape out of his careful control.

“Yohan, just wait.” Jisoo said as he motioned to Evan giving him a knowing look. The taller boy walked off screen as Jisoo continued. “Just wait. He… he left us a note.” Jisoo said as Evan returned with a napkin in his hand. Jisoo took it and took a deep careful breath. A pause and then he began.

""I'm sorry for leaving without saying anything. But I finally found a way to change things. A way to make an actual difference in the world. Don't try to find me. Where I'm going, you can't follow. Love, Seo Harin.”

Yohan sat for a moment tears falling freely now as he made no attempt to hide them. He turned away from his group members, his former brothers. He sat in silence unsure of what to say, to feel.

“We’re sorry Yohan really we-“ Evan began again before Yohan turned to him and glared at him.

“Shut up! Just shut up, you’re not sorry for not telling me you’re sorry you got caught. No.” Yohan said as he threw his water bottle across the room with a series of loud clangs. His hands were shaking a rage building and he felt like he might burst like a cork on a bottle of expensive champagne. He was confused, sure. But he did know one emotion he felt, betrayed. “I never want to speak to you again.”

With that he dispersed the Iris Messages. The protestations from his group members lost to him in the now eerie quiet that overtook his dark room. Yohan stood there a numbness creeping over him. He felt nothing and everything all at once. Trust had always been hard for Yohan, there were very few people he felt that he could trust one hundred percent. Since he was little he had very few people on the list and today that list got significantly shorter.

Yohan was sad, he was angry, he felt like breaking something. But despite Yohan’s best wishes a flood of memories rushed his mind all at once. Snippets of his life, snippets of the people he had loved like brothers. Jisoo coming to the practice room late one night offering Yohan a water and a break from Yohan’s self imposed criticism during a late night solo practice sesssion. Evan putting a lengthy arm around Yohan’s shoulder as they walked the streets of Seoul after an intense workout and making Yohan feel safe and like he belonged. Harin sitting cross legged on his bed across of Yohan in the room they shared in the HopLyte dorm. A small smile on his lips as he offered Yohan a snack. A hug when Yohan started crying after thinking about his ex. The four of them sitting on a too small couch in the their dorm living room watching a cheesy K-drama together. Evan’s long limbs shoving Yohan onto Harin’s lap, Jisoo spilling his banana milk on the coffee table as Evan elbowed his arm, and burst of laughter from all four of them. A closeness that only brothers can share. All of it gone, all of it shattered like a priceless artifact. A history of a time long gone and better off forgotten.

As Yohan rose to his full height he walked over to the mirror in his room. He stared at his face for a long time. The hints of any smile long gone. What remained was a hard stare. What remained wasn’t a boy, no that boy was gone. What remained was someone broken, someone discarded. Trash. Trust had never been easy for Yohan, but one thing was certain. It would be impossible in the future. So as he stared at himself his face hardened and Yohan didn’t recognize who he saw any longer. But he continued to stare to try and learn who he was now, as if the answer was there in the mirror, but the truth wasn’t there.

The truth eluded him like trust did and maybe that’s how he ended up here? Yohan had been lying to most people since he joined camp and maybe the truth was that what you give to the universe you receive ten fold? Maybe if he hadn’t lied, hadn’t hid parts of himself this wouldn’t have happened? He didn’t know the answer to these questions. What he was is a scared boy alone for the first time in almost a decade. What he was was a broken boy who had the rug ripped out from underneath him. But only time could tell if he could collect any of his pieces again.",3,1767667673.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

1. While you start speaking to your match, you'll start to see some desperation in her replies and she is eager to meet you (ladkiya dry text krti hai ek to phle hi and ye to alag se too good to be true holiya ji)

2. Kaha ho, kaha rehte to, mil lete h, vibe match karlenge milke fir dekh lenge kaha jaana hai , baaki tum jaga bologe mai ajaungi

Now what if she's texting good but doesn't seem to be a scammer but you're not sure, do this

1. First date should be getting to know the person, not party or something (subjective but I'll add up), so ask her out at a known place which are inexpensive. I mostly prefer somewhere to walk and try out street food, like gol gappe , momos or some lassi together, that gives us space and amazing ambience to connect. Or it could be a coffee shop too which would hardly cost around 250 max. Your budget shouldn't exceed 500-1.5k on first date because you never know what's coming ( subjective acc to baap ka paisa🥀)

-ek baar mai to mele me gaya tha wahi ki first date jhula jhule, glass wale game khele or teddy jeeta😭

2. If she's into you, she would appreciate you, she's coming for you, not your materialsic things, that doesn't mean you would not get anything for her, 100rs ke flowers se kuch ni hota, sweet gesture 

Now for the peeps who wanna drink and stuff 

1. Ask her out at your place or your known place, or ask her out somewhere which is pretty famous, if she's denying it then you know what it is

2. Having the conversation of split can make things awkward for many women as they expect a man to pay, but a considerable women will atleast offer to split or pay, if she does, it's your duty to pay up the bill, but if she doesn't even flinch, time to split babyyy. First date h, anjaan ho tum, nobody is obliged to. It's just a sweet gesture that an man to pay up and she will appreciate that ( only if she offers, warna samjh jaana she's here for free food)

1q56hay,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q56hay/are_habit_tracking_apps_really_worth_their_price/,Are habit tracking apps really worth their price?,"Hello,

I ask myself a real question after testing a lot of habit tracking apps (stop smoking, sleep better, light sports, diet, coffee, etc.).

Honestly, I can't understand what justifies paying for many of these apps. In most cases, I have the impression that it is not much more than:
•	 Check a box
•	 Display a streak
•	 Send notifications
And in the end... I could do the same thing on Notion, a paper calendar, or even a simple note.

I also noticed that:
•	 Many apps bet a lot on streaks (which I sometimes find anxiety-inducing)
•	 Notifications quickly become invasive
•	 The majority is paying without necessarily bringing real educational value

Personally, what I would really look for would be rather:
•	 Concrete help to quit smoking (not just ""day 12 bravo"")
•	 Simple tips for better sleep
•	 Maintain form without performance obsession
•	 A real follow-up of food hygiene
•	 Reduce coffee with explained alternatives
I often have the impression that these apps are motivating in the short term, but not very educational or really accompanying in the long term.

I have tried several apps such as habitify, streaks, habitbull, productive etc .. but none makes me want more than that

So I'm curious:
•	 What do you really like about tracking apps?
•	 What makes you stay instead of giving up after 2 weeks?
•	 Do you know any apps that give real personalized advice based on habits (and not just stats)?

1q56gvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q56gvo/stress_may_have_killed_my_coworker_could_i_be_next/,Stress may have killed my coworker. Could I be next?,"A young colleague suffered a heart attack at my office today and it’s made me worried about my lifestyle. 

I would consider it stressful. Work around 13-14 hours a day (all screen time), 1 hour workout, 3ish hours of personal work/cleaning/errands, then around 6 hours of sleep if I’m lucky. Sometimes it’s better, often worse.

In the office there is free energy drinks and coffee, I also use caffeine pills, nicotine pouches, and on needed occasions, adderall. On extra special occasions, come. Gym there as well. The office also has free food that I eat and its normally healthy. To be honest, with the stimulants I’m not often hungry.

I don’t think this is so bad, but I can’t explain how bad I feel after work. I’m riddled with stress. It’s not unnecessary anxiety though, my coworkers have said they feel it too and it’s grounded in the deadlines I have. The only time I don’t feel stressed is when I workout.

I don’t know if stress in and of itself is bad for health, or the other behaviors caused by stress is bad… I don’t want to die of a heart attack. Do I need to manage stress or my behaviors to avoid one?

1q56e1l,https://i.redd.it/r1ht2uzq5nbg1.png,I Chose to Divorce After Three Years of Serving My Husband’s Family,"For four years since I married into this family, I’ve cooked the New Year’s Eve dinner three times in a row.



Each time, I’d head to my in-laws’ house early to prepare the dishes. Working from dawn till dusk, exhausted to the point of collapse and no one helped me.



This year, being pregnant, my mother-in-law arranged for the whole family to dine out. After finishing the housework and rushing to the restaurant, I found they had already started eating.



Twelve people from four households, but only eleven seats in the private room. I stood awkwardly at the door.



I didn’t know whether to leave or stay. I wanted to ask the waiter to add another seat, but my mother-in-law looked displeased.



“Can’t you see the private room is already crowded enough? What are you doing here? Once we’re done eating, Yohan can bring you some leftovers, right?”



——



I never imagined that just because I skipped cooking one New Year’s Eve dinner, I wouldn’t even have a seat to eat.



Standing there, I was stunned by my mother-in-law’s questioning. “No one told me I couldn’t come?”



I looked at her, but she just reminded me that pregnant women shouldn’t be running around. I should’ve stayed home resting and there was no need to come out.



I was speechless. Who had left all those chores for me to do earlier? I worked from four to six and took only a quick sip of water.



Then I changed clothes and rushed over for the New Year’s Eve dinner. But when I arrived, they told me there was no seat for me at all.



My second sister-in-law sneered beside me, “Hey, sis, haven’t you ever eaten at a restaurant before? Now you’re trying to freeload? You’re over four months pregnant, don’t you think about the baby?”



I swallowed my anger and replied calmly, “No need for your concern. I’ll take responsibility for my own child.”



Unexpectedly, my mother-in-law’s face darkened. She set down her cutlery and asked slowly, “The child isn’t just yours, it’s our Fortescue’s too.”



“If something really happens, what responsibility can you possibly take besides crying a few times?”



I glanced at my eldest sister-in-law and second sister-in-law, who were waiting to see me humiliated. Then at my indifferent husband and the others who remained silent.



Sighing, I decided to stand my ground. “Mom, if you truly care about me, why did you make me handle all the housework?”



“You go out for morning exercises, play chess in the afternoon. Can’t you spare a single moment?”



My mother-in-law was shocked by my words. She probably hadn’t expected me to contradict her in public.



She immediately roared angrily, “I do the housework, then what do you do? Lie in bed? Even pregnant, you need exercise! Otherwise, you’ll become useless!”



I countered, “Mom, don’t your words contradict yourself? First you tell me to stay home and not wander off, yet now you want me to exercise more?”



Ever since marrying Yohan Fortescue, these past four years have been nothing but turmoil.



At first, we planned to move out and live independently. But because my eldest and second children didn’t want to live with us, my in-laws started pestering us.



Being shy and sensitive, I ultimately had no choice but to agree. Little did I know it would be the start of my nightmare.



From my wake-up time to the frequency of my water intake, I controlled every aspect of my life. I worked all day and still have to do housework when I get home.



My father-in-law played cards and my mother-in-law played chess. During holidays, whenever the whole family gathered for meals, I was always the one responsible for cooking.



I complained to my husband countless times, but he always brushed me off. Over time, I grew numb to it all. But this time, I didn’t want to tolerate it anymore.



Seeing me stand up to his parents, especially with the other two families present, Yohan kept signaling me to leave.



Chapter 2



If I refuse to go, he accuses me of being unreasonable. “We can discuss this at home. Why make a scene here?”



I stared at him silently, then suddenly laughed. My laughter was tinged with utter helplessness.



“Yohan, is this what you think? You think I’m a disgrace? All these years of humiliation I’ve endured, when did you ever stand up for me?”



“Before we married, you promised we’d live separately. Did you keep that promise? Of all the things you promised me, which one did you actually fulfill?”



“Every time I ask, you come up with one excuse after another. Is this fun?”



Faced with this barrage of questions, Yohan’s expression darkened. He glanced around at the others first, still worried about saving face.



He hadn’t considered these issues at all. My mother-in-law stared at me in disbelief.



“Well, well! After just a few years, you want to kick us out? Who agreed to let us live with you in the first place? Now you want to go back on your word?”



I scoffed coldly, “If you hadn’t cried, screamed and threatened suicide, would I have agreed? I couldn’t help it. I couldn’t be as heartless as the other two sisters-in-law.”



At these words, both the eldest and the second sisters-in-law’s expressions changed. They glared at me with furrowed brows, but couldn’t say anything. Who told them to be so guilty to begin with?



Back when my mother-in-law fell ill and needed a daughter-in-law to care for her, they never uttered a word about it, not even a glance.



In the end, it was my own reluctance that made me agree. Now the Fortescue family reaps what they sowed. It was my bad luck.



But I never expected my mother-in-law would shower the other two daughters-in-law with even more affection. When it came to me, it was expected. All I wanted to ask was why?



“Are you done making a scene? It’s the New Year! What are you shouting about? You’ve ruined the mood for the whole family!”



Faced with Yohan’s accusations, I could only retort, “Sorry, but I’m going to make a scene tonight. With the whole family here, I won’t feel right until I speak up.”



Suddenly, my father-in-law smashed his bowl. When the room finally fell silent, he stood up, furious.



“Look at yourselves! What kind of behavior is this? We finally got the whole family together for the holidays and you have to start fighting now? Whoever wants to eat this meal can have it. I’m done!”



My eldest and second brothers-in-law left with their wives and children. Everyone’s expressions were clearly uncomfortable.



My mother-in-law glared at me coldly. “Are you satisfied now? Did you have to make such a scene to get your way?”



Yohan looked at me with disappointment. As if I’d committed some unforgivable crime, he turned and walked away.



Probably because I was so emotionally overwhelmed, my belly suddenly clenched in pain, forcing me to crouch down, gasping for breath.



I tried to grab the chair to steady myself. But I still ended up sprawled on the floor, drenched in cold sweat.



My husband and mother-in-law, the last to leave, witnessed my collapse. My mother-in-law was stunned at first, then began to mock me.



“Starting to put on a show now? Think this will win you sympathy? It won’t work. What you did today can never be forgiven.”



Yohan looked down at me with disdain. I reached out for him to call 911, but he pushed my hand away.



His face twisted with disgust. “I’m ashamed to have a wife like you, just keep pretending. No matter how well you act, it won’t change anything. You’ve already disappointed me.”



Watching their retreating backs. The only one truly disappointed was me. When I woke up again, I was already in the hospital.



Chapter 3



My brother, Zeno Noury, sat beside me. He’d driven all the way from our hometown just to be here and take care of me.



Seeing my family, tears welled up in my eyes. Zeno spoke to me carefully, “Abigail, there’s something you need to be prepared for. The doctor said that due to emotional and other factors, the baby... the baby is gone.”



He quickly reassured me, “But as long as you’re okay, that’s all that matters!”



Actually, my parents were there too, standing in the hallway. Zeno had decided to tell me this alone.



He’d thought of countless ways to comfort me, fearing I might break down. But unexpectedly, I remained strangely calm.



I didn’t cry or make a scene, just stared blankly at my belly. I stayed in the hospital for three days.



During that time, Yohan and his family never once showed their faces. My parents couldn’t bear it and wanted to confront them.



I stopped them, hoping they’d let me handle this matter myself. That evening, I packed my things to go home.



On the way, I got a call from Yohan. “Have you calmed down? When are you coming home?”



They thought I was angry, which was why I’d been staying at my parents’ place. I forced a bitter smile.



“I’m in the car. I’ll be home tonight.”



Yohan just said, “Oh, okay.”



He then hung up the call, completely indifferent.



When I got home, my mother-in-law opened the door. She looked me up and down, unable to hold back her complaints.



“Had enough fun out there? I’ve never seen anyone like you, who goes back to parents’ house after a fight.”



She added, “I’ve been doing all the housework these past few days. Are you satisfied now?”



I glanced around the house and was stunned by the sight before me. The living room was filthy beyond belief, littered with sunflower seed shells and fruit peels everywhere.



The dining table was a mess, needless to say and the coffee table was splattered with grease and soup stains. Fruit flies were buzzing around it.



I asked, “This is what you call cleaning?”



I couldn’t comprehend how they could live in such conditions. If I were in this environment, every second would feel like torture.



My mother-in-law snapped back impatiently, “What else could I do? It is already the best I can do.”



Yohan chimed in from the side, “She’s so old, Abigail. How do you expect her to handle this house? The rest is up to you. Is two hours enough?”



Surveying the utter chaos, I could only sneer inwardly, then replied firmly, “If you can’t handle it, do it yourselves. If you can’t manage, pay for a cleaner. I’m not your servant.”



With that, I grabbed my bag and went straight inside.



My mother-in-law yelled, “Is that how a daughter-in-law should speak? Looks like your trip back to your hometown has made you forget your place!”



Yohan blocked the bedroom door, preventing me from locking it.



He warned me, “Do you even know how much it costs to hire a cleaner? How much money do we have for you to throw around like this?”



I really admire them. They didn’t lift a finger when I was not around.



Fine, if they won’t work, at least stop eating nonstop. They made the house messy and dirty, just waiting for me to come back and clean it all up alone?



“Aren’t your parents quite generous?”



“They'd rather talk business at the New Year's Eve dinner table than spend $300 on a cleaning service?”



My mother-in-law explained, “What’s wrong with spending a little money for the whole family to eat together once a year? Isn’t that how it should be? Are we supposed to split the cost between three families?”



I replied, “Yeah, that’s how it should be.”



Instead of getting angry, I laughed and challenged her. “Then why don’t you pay the monthly mortgage, car loan and utilities?”



“All of these, I paid for them all! That’s what you should pay for, why should I? The house and car aren’t mine and the utilities aren’t that much.”



Chapter 4



Seeing my mother-in-law resorting to unreasonable arguments, I didn’t bother saying much more. I was used to it and it has been like this for years.



The mortgage was $4,000, the car loan was $1,000 and utilities totaled over $5,000. Plus, every day groceries and dining out were all on me.



Even with my salary of over $10,000, it’s not enough to keep this up. Not to mention how many times my in-laws took my money to subsidize their other two sons.



I pushed Yohan aside and warned them before closing the door. “You can handle the cleaning yourselves. I’m only here to pack my things.”



I added, “Tomorrow morning, I’m driving to the 55 to finalize the paperwork.”



Yohan thought he’d misheard and demanded why I needed to go to the City Hall.



I smiled and countered, “What else would you need to go there for besides divorce?”



“You actually want to divorce me? Have you lost your mind?”



My husband seemed flustered, his voice not as loud as before. His mother, however, appeared utterly unconcerned. I suspected she’d be delighted if I divorced her son.



Still, Yohan warned me, “Fine, you can divorce me. But first, you’ll give birth to the child.”



My mother-in-law said, “That’s my precious grandson. You won’t be able to disappear without giving birth to my son.”



Grandson?



All I wanted now was to sever this relationship. And never have anything to do with their family again.



Of course, I calmly replied, “I didn’t give you a choice. See you at the City Hall tomorrow morning.”



I only grabbed a few clothes and my tablet. As I was leaving, Yohan rushed after me. He grabbed my wrist, forcing me to stop.



“Haven’t you gone too far lately? Must you do this during the New Year? Fine, I’ll hire a cleaner. You just stay home and keep an eye on things.”



As soon as Yohan finished, his mother started complaining, “That won’t do! Hiring a cleaner is so expensive. What better things could we buy with that money?”



“Besides, you’ve backed down this time. Who knows what kind of trouble this brat will cause in the future?”



I nearly laughed out loud. “So marrying into your family means I’m free labor, huh? All the food, drinks and expenses, it’s all on me. Can’t you show some decency?”



At that, my mother-in-law trembled with rage. Pointing at me in disbelief, she yelled, “You... dare insult me?”



I replied, “Why not? Don’t I deserve it? When I married into this family, you gave me a TV and it’s secondhand, right? No house, no money for renovations and you wouldn’t even pay for the wedding.”



Before I could finish, my mother-in-law started arguing back. “We had no money back then. What could I do?”



I countered, “Was it truly no money, or just unwillingness to spend on me? When the eldest and second son got married, I never saw you being this stingy.”



“And every time you were sick and hospitalized, who was there taking care of you? People should have basic decency. No one is anyone else’s slave!”



“You... you... you...”



My mother-in-law trembled all over, unable to utter a word.



I knew she had no counterargument.



It was also for her son’s benefit. Sure enough, Yohan approached his mother and pointed an accusing finger at me.



“Get out! This family doesn’t need you anymore!”



I smiled calmly. “I was waiting for you to say that.”



Without another glance back, I walked away. I checked into a hotel and unlinked the bank card tied to the household account. Making sure they couldn’t touch a single penny, I then called my lawyer friend.



I wanted to get all our assets back and kick that family out of here.



The next day, Yohan did show up at the City Hall on time. His parents were with him.



When they saw me get out of the car, my mother-in-law started her sarcastic remarks, “You still have the nerve to drive here? Once both of you divorced, that car won’t be yours anymore.”



I was too lazy to argue with her. I knew that’s how people who didn’t understand the law were. They would say anything, but unfortunately, I didn’t care what they said.



Yohan looked at me with a complicated expression. “Are you really sure about the divorce? I can give you another chance.”



I answered, “No need. Just sign the divorce papers.”



Before going inside, my mother-in-law laid down three conditions. The divorce was acceptable, but the house, the car and the grandson must all go to their family.



Yohan nodded in agreement. “Exactly. That’s what I think too.”



I looked at them with a cold smile. “You must have discussed all this last night, right? It’s a pity you can’t take anything with you. The property deed is in my name. I paid for the car. As for the child...”



I touched my belly, reminding them expressionlessly. “No need to mention the child. He’s already gone.”

Long-time lurker in recovery spaces, finally coming out of the shadows. I was a daily 10–20 beers guy for about a decade (plus smokes, pharma, most drugs except the really bad ones). Born privileged, nice neighborhood—none of that protected me.

11 years sober now. What finally “cured” me wasn’t endless meetings or accepting a lifelong disease label—it was seeing the full picture: alcohol isn’t just a personal issue, it’s a normalized poison designed to keep society compliant, profitable, and stuck. Once that clicked, the desire vanished completely. No white-knuckling needed.

I wrote it all down in a short book called “The Cure for Alcohol.” Covers:  
\- Alcohol’s historical use as control (ancient Egypt to today)  
\- Why moderation and “drink responsibly” are traps  
\- Critique of victim/disease narratives  
\- Practical tips for the brutal first weeks/months (what actually worked for me)  
\- Building a life outside the “stadium” of booze culture

It’s 100% free — PDF, EPUB, Word downloads, no signup, no paywall. Optional donation if it helps you and you want to buy me a coffee, but seriously no obligation.

Feel free to download, share with a friend in need, email, print—whatever. The truth shouldn’t cost anything.

If it resonates (or if you think I’m full of it), I’d love to hear your thoughts. This community has helped me indirectly for years—just wanted to give something back.

Take care,

1q56b3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q56b3l/med_school_friends_iced_me_out_now_they_want_to/,"Med school friends iced me out, now they want to hang out again, how do I navigate this?","I (F23) started med school last summer (2025). My cohort is small, and while everyone is generally friendly, it naturally split into two groups. I quickly became close with the group I fell in with; we studied together all day, took coffee breaks, and spent most of our time together.

About halfway through the fall semester, things started to feel off. My “friends” became distant, and I eventually found out they had made a separate group chat where negative things were being said about me. I asked one of the girls I was closest to what was going on, and she told me in detail what had been said, it was mostly driven by one person, but no one else pushed back. The friend who I talked to about it asked me not to say anything because she didn’t want to get in the middle of it. 

What hurt the most was that some of the things being said were judgments about very personal things I had trusted them with. These were things I only shared after they had repeatedly asked what was wrong, saying they could tell I was struggling mentally and emotionally and wanted to support me. Instead, those disclosures were made fun of, and my feelings were essentially labeled as “too much.” Knowing that things I shared in a vulnerable moment after being encouraged to open up were discussed behind my back was incredibly painful.

I was devastated. Med school is already incredibly difficult, and having your support system turn on you doesn’t exactly help. I tried changing myself based on their criticisms, but nothing improved and I continued to be iced out.

After a lot of conversations with my family and my therapist, I decided to remove myself from the situation. I decided that I didn’t need to stay in a group where I wasn’t wanted. The behavior felt juvenile, I thought that at this age people would have outgrown being catty. Stepping away ended up being one of the best decisions I could have made. I’ve felt calmer, more at peace, and better able to focus on my studies.

Now the new semester has started, and suddenly everyone from that friend group wants to be friendly again. They’ve been asking how I’ve been, saying things like “I feel like we haven’t talked in forever,” and asking to hang out and catch up.
I don’t want to create drama by staying distant, but I also don’t want to put myself in a position to be hurt again. At the same time, I do want friends. I’ve thought about trying to get closer to the other half of the cohort, but they’ve already grown very tight over the past six months, and I’m not sure how to break into that socially.

At this point, I feel stuck. I know how I feel and how the change has been good for me, but at the same time i’m second-guessing myself and feel like maybe I was overreacting to the situation. I don’t know if it is worth trying to mend the friendships, how I navigate it if I decide not to, and if I decide to not try and patch things up, realistically, how am I suppsoed to build connections with the rest of my cohort at this point.
Any advice would be appreciated.

1q56amt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1q56amt/itinerary_check/,Itinerary Check,"Hi all! We're just about to book our trip for next month for a honeymoon. I am concerned it's a bit rushed as I see others spending 3-5 days in places we are going to be 1-3 days. But we are young, will have a car, and pretty easy going if plans change. However, this is only our second international trip as adults and would love to get feedback from experienced travelers on our plans and a few questions I added at the bottom. Thanks!

**Day 1:** Land in SJO and check in at hotel

**Day 2:** Breakfast, pick up rental car, and drive to Puerto Jimenez

**Day 3:** Breakfast in town, hang at the beach, late lunch/early dinner,  evening mangrove tour

**Day 4:** Corcovado Tour (all day)

**Day 5:** Sleep in check out and drive to Uvitas/Dominical. Drop luggage off, and go to Cataratas Nauyaca.

**Day 6:** Whale tour in morning, spend rest of day exploring / at beach. (SEEKING ADVICE ON LODGING)

**Day 7:** Wake up early, and spend all day at Manuel Antonio. Dinner at Emilio's Cafe

**Day 8:** Sleep in, check out, and drive to Monteverde, lunch and spend the afternoon in the forest. Dinner at Nativo Restaurant

**Day 9:** Coffee tour in the morning, San Lucas Treetop Dining Glass Lounge Experience

**Day 10:** Sleep in, check out, and drive to Fortuna see the waterfall, and end the day in the hot springs

**Day 11:** Maybe do hot springs again in the morning, go see Arenal. Add water rafting trip in afternoon if there's time

**Day 12:** Check out, Drive back to San Jose, stop along a couple waterfalls (Bajos del Toro & Catarata Vuelta del Cañon) if there's time. Check in to hotel

**Day 13:** Sadly, come home

**QUESTIONS:**

1. **Day 5-7:** For this part, we're curious if anyone has experience checking out of an AirBnB but picking up luggage later. We want to stay near Manuel Antonio on Day 6 before we tour it Day 7, but aren't sure if any BnBs in Uvitas would let us check out but come get luggage later so that we can do things in Uvitas during the day before driving up to Manuel Antonio. We've seen early luggage drop off as an option, so that's why we thought some might offer late luggage pickup. Or would it make more sense to drive all the way up to Manuel Antonio, check in somewhere there and drive back for the other activities?
2. **Monteverde:** Are there specific can't miss activities/tours here? or should we just go self-guided exploring
3. **Fortuna:** This is the part where I feel we might be rushing - should we spend more time  here? If so, would it be just relaxing or are there activities. Should we cut something else out or add a day to the trip?",0,1767666838.0,CostaRicaTravel,4,0.5,False

I started BookDrive because I believe books still matter, and that they work best when they’re part of everyday life rather than hidden behind shelves or algorithms.

BookDrive is a mobile, pop up bookstore based in Columbia, Missouri. Instead of a fixed location, it moves. That movement is intentional. I bring thoughtfully curated books into places where people already are, like campuses, coffee shops, sidewalks, and community events, and let curiosity do the rest.

The idea is simple: **Books That Move People.**

I don’t try to stock everything. I choose books carefully. The focus is on titles that challenge, comfort, inspire, or open something up in the reader. Curation matters more to me than volume.

BookDrive operates out of a custom built BookCart that folds out and rolls into public spaces. Chalkboard surfaces and handwritten notes are part of the experience. I want it to feel approachable, human, and low pressure, not polished or transactional.

Pricing is intentional and kept affordable. The goal isn’t to maximize margin on every sale. It’s to keep books circulating and accessible.

At its core, BookDrive is a small, mobile bookstore, a curated reading experience, and a community facing project rooted in the belief that reading still matters and works better when it feels personal.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading and for your interest. I hope you find more things worth reading, whether it’s through BookDrive or elsewhere.

1q563hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1q563hh/seriously_seriously/,Seriously. SERIOUSLY?!,"Today started with me waking up the husband like usual and trying to send him upstairs to wake and retrieve our toddler. He barely opens his eyes and groans that he doesn't feel good. 

Okay fine. I do the stairs, wake the toddler and bring her down, taking her straight to the highchair for breakfast.

She eats, I pack her lunch and her bag. I wake him up for the 3rd or 4th time at this point, telling him the time and reminding him that he has coffee. 

He continues to groan about feel sick. He's achy. His stomach hurts. He doesn't feel good. 

So he decides he's calling in sick. But he's apparently too sick to also watch the toddler and insists I still get her ready and he calls a friend to pick her up and deliver her to the sitter. 

By this point I've already brought him  medication, coffee, extra blanket, thermometer and whatever else he whined for. 

I sit down with my coffee, try to enjoy my last few minutes before work. 

Throughout the day he's continued to whine that he doesn't feel good. Asks me to bring him medicine, water, warm his cold coffee when I'm on breaks. 

Toddler is delivered home by the same friend at the end of the day. She starts inconsolably whining that shes tired and wants her baba. I turn on her cartoon and warm her Supper. 

I get her in the highchair and she's still whining about the baba. I want her to eat, so I give her a few ounces of milk to have with her Supper. 

While dealing with this, he's whining about how bad he feels, asks for soup and a sandwich for supper instead of the chicken and Mashed potatoe leftovers. So I'm tending to the toddler who is calmer but still periodically whining, cooking soup, and popping into the livingroom what feels like every 2 minutes because he's asking for something else. 

Towards the end of Supper I tell the toddler after she eats ill run her a bath. She's excited, gobbles her Supper up. 

I bring her up at 645 and throw her in the bath. It's like 730 almost when I pull the plug. I take her into her warm bedroom to get her dressed for bed/tomorrow. Half way through I hear my name whine yelled from down stairs. 

He wants me to run him a bath. 

Toddler is happy to play in her room like a foot from the bathroom so I pop into the bathroom and throw the hot water on. 

I spend the next 10 minutes going between the tub and the toddler. 

I yell down that the bath is ready and ask that he bring my phone from the kitchen table. No response. 

I go back to the toddlers room and a minute later hear my reminder alarm screaming down stairs. It goes off for several minutes before it's finally shut off and he shuffles up to the bath.

For the next HOUR that I'm in the toddlers room, I'm constantly going back and forth between playing and reading to toddler and popping into the bathroom because he keeps freaking calling me and WILL NOT respond unless I walk into the room. 

I want a town for my shoulders. Can you run more hot water? Can you grab me a candle and turn off the light? Just thing after thing. 

At 815 I declare bedtime. Toddler isn't having it. Screams when I try to rock her. 

I fight with her for a while and then set her down again to play. He says I should take her down and let her play an hour. 

Fine. She's not going down anyway. 

Get there and he wants another round of meds. A bowl in case he pukes. His leftover supper put away for later. 

I think to myself, well, at least I'm getting like 3 hours in the morning to nap and unwind due to a late starting shift! HA. As if he can read my fucking mind, he says ""you work late tomorrow right?"" I say yes, I don't start until 11. He calls the sitter and tells them he'll drop the toddler off or have that friend do so at like 1030. FUCK. 

An hour goes by, toddler is over tired, over stimulated and crashing all the way out. 

She rips her diaper off and says she needs to pee on the potty. Fine. I grab the potty. She sits for a few seconds, declares she's done and then REFUSES to put her damn diaper on. 

Fought her on that for what felt like forever. 

It's 1030 now. 

I've been running my ass off every second of this day. I'm currently hiding in the bathroom to write this, knowing I have to go downstairs, wash dishes, set up the coffee pot for tomorrow, etc.
etc.

He's already said he doesn't know if he's going tomorrow. My ONE chance to nap and relax is gone. 

I'm exhausted and I know it'll be several days of him acting like he's actively dying and can't do a thing for himself.

Then I realized the ""right moment"" doesn't exist. I'm just spending my regular days surrounded by things I'm not letting myself enjoy.

So I started using the good stuff on random tuesdays. Lighting the candle while I fold laundry. Using the nice mug for my morning coffee instead of the chipped one. Putting on the lotion that makes me feel fancy even though I'm just sitting on my couch, etc etc.

It sounds wierd, but it actually shifted something. My regular days started feeling less like something to survive and more like something worth enjoying. Like I'm treating myself with the same care I'd give to a guest in my home.

With each breath a foggy patch formed on the glass; small droplets clung to it, too light to slide down.

Melancholy. A deep, aching melancholy.

In his mind Jacob wandered through his own labyrinth. “What coffee did I drink today?” “God, I love coffee.” He could have drifted in these thoughts endlessly, if not for what happened next — the moment that shattered everything he thought he understood.

His sneaker touched the ground, taking on the weight of his whole body as he stepped out of the trolleybus. His elbow swung up and, with unexpected grace, slammed into the face of a passerby. A thin stream of warm blood slid down the shaved skin and onto the smiling face.

Jacob couldn’t speak — he was too stunned. The man smiled at him, showing no trace of pain; for a split second his eyes went glassy, then opened wider than before, full of joy. He wished Jacob a good day, apologized, and stepped onto the trolleybus.

The vehicle pulled away, rattling around the bend, wheels screeching softly. Jacob tried to process what had just happened, and a new idea crept into his mind.

Scanning the street, his gaze fell on a storm drain: sheltered from the damp beneath the metal grate sat a tiny mouse. Crouching down slowly, he took a closer look. The creature chewed a seed calmly, without a hint of fear.

Jacob extended his hand. The mouse climbed onto his palm as if it understood what was expected of it. Shell fragments fell from its paws like chips from a craftsman’s hands. The little creature was given a name — Tu. Jacob felt fatigue for the first time in a long while as he walked toward home with Tu resting softly in his hand.

…

His eyelids sagged under the weight of his lashes, drifting down and rising again. His legs dragged loosely across the floor — a feeling he loved, rare but pleasant, especially after sleepless nights: the desire to collapse and disappear for a couple of hours.

Passing the old light-green telephone, a sharp, electric ring tore through the room like a lightning strike. Whatever drowsiness had lingered vanished instantly. Closing the distance to the phone felt like wading through something thick. Seconds stretched into something closer to hours before he finally lifted the receiver to his ear. The silence on the other end was louder than any words could have been.

Then he heard it: the soft groan of wooden floorboards behind him.

He turned — and froze.
There she was. His love.

It felt like an eternity had passed. His legs resisted every step he tried to take; excitement and dread tangled in his muscles. And then the fear hit — a fear unlike anything he’d ever felt. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

The woman who stood there looked exactly like Louise, yet something essential was missing. Physically, yes — it was her. But nothing beyond that. Her eyes were stretched wide, her smile indistinguishable from the empty cheer plastered on everyone else’s faces in this city.

She stood only a few feet away. He felt nothing familiar.

Only discomfort.
Only horror.

And then she spoke, in a voice that wasn’t hers:

“Nobody disappears here.”

1q561oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1q561oa/nobody_disappears_here_walls_can_hear_you/,Nobody Disappears Here (Walls Can Hear You),"His cheek pressed against the cold metal of the tram window frame. With each breath a foggy patch formed on the glass; small droplets clung to it, too light to slide down.

Melancholy. A deep, aching melancholy.

In his mind Jacob wandered through his own labyrinth. “What coffee did I drink today?” “God, I love coffee.” He could have drifted in these thoughts endlessly, if not for what happened next — the moment that shattered everything he thought he understood.

His sneaker touched the ground, taking on the weight of his whole body as he stepped out of the trolleybus. His elbow swung up and, with unexpected grace, slammed into the face of a passerby. A thin stream of warm blood slid down the shaved skin and onto the smiling face.

Jacob couldn’t speak — he was too stunned. The man smiled at him, showing no trace of pain; for a split second his eyes went glassy, then opened wider than before, full of joy. He wished Jacob a good day, apologized, and stepped onto the trolleybus.

The vehicle pulled away, rattling around the bend, wheels screeching softly. Jacob tried to process what had just happened, and a new idea crept into his mind.

Scanning the street, his gaze fell on a storm drain: sheltered from the damp beneath the metal grate sat a tiny mouse. Crouching down slowly, he took a closer look. The creature chewed a seed calmly, without a hint of fear.

Jacob extended his hand. The mouse climbed onto his palm as if it understood what was expected of it. Shell fragments fell from its paws like chips from a craftsman’s hands. The little creature was given a name — Tu. Jacob felt fatigue for the first time in a long while as he walked toward home with Tu resting softly in his hand.

…

His eyelids sagged under the weight of his lashes, drifting down and rising again. His legs dragged loosely across the floor — a feeling he loved, rare but pleasant, especially after sleepless nights: the desire to collapse and disappear for a couple of hours.

Passing the old light-green telephone, a sharp, electric ring tore through the room like a lightning strike. Whatever drowsiness had lingered vanished instantly. Closing the distance to the phone felt like wading through something thick. Seconds stretched into something closer to hours before he finally lifted the receiver to his ear. The silence on the other end was louder than any words could have been.

Then he heard it: the soft groan of wooden floorboards behind him.

He turned — and froze.
There she was. His love.

It felt like an eternity had passed. His legs resisted every step he tried to take; excitement and dread tangled in his muscles. And then the fear hit — a fear unlike anything he’d ever felt. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

The woman who stood there looked exactly like Louise, yet something essential was missing. Physically, yes — it was her. But nothing beyond that. Her eyes were stretched wide, her smile indistinguishable from the empty cheer plastered on everyone else’s faces in this city.

She stood only a few feet away. He felt nothing familiar.

Only discomfort.
Only horror.

And then she spoke, in a voice that wasn’t hers:

“Nobody disappears here.”

1q55iw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q55iw2/5_sciencebased_keys_to_living_a_happy_introverted/,5 Science-Based Keys to Living a HAPPY Introverted Life,"I spent years thinking something was fundamentally broken with me because I'd rather read on a Friday night than hit the bars. Turns out, I wasn't broken, just wired differently. After diving deep into research from psychologists, neuroscientists, and industry experts, plus testing everything on myself, I figured out what actually makes introverts thrive. Not survive, thrive. This isn't about ""fixing"" yourself or forcing extroversion. It's about working with your brain, not against it.

# 1. Stop Apologizing for Your Energy Management Style

Your battery drains differently. Science backs this up. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney's research in ""The Introvert Advantage"" shows introverts literally process stimulation through longer neural pathways, using more acetylcholine (the ""stay focused and chill"" neurotransmitter) versus dopamine (the ""let's party"" one). This means you're not antisocial or boring, you're just operating on a different neurological system.

Practical move: Start treating alone time like a legitimate appointment. Block it on your calendar. Tell people you have plans (you do, with yourself). The podcast ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"" by Susan Cain breaks down why this matters. Cain, who gave one of the most viewed TED talks ever and spent seven years researching introversion, makes it clear that solitude isn't selfish, it's necessary maintenance.

Set boundaries without guilt. ""I need to recharge tonight"" is a complete sentence. People who matter will get it. People who don't aren't your people.

# 2. Design Your Social Life Like a Strategic Game

Quality over quantity isn't just a cliche, it's survival strategy. Research from Oxford evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar shows humans max out at about 150 meaningful connections, but introverts thrive with way fewer, deeper bonds. Stop forcing yourself into group hangs that drain you and invest in one on one connections.

I use an app called Ash for relationship coaching. It's basically therapy lite that helps you figure out which connections actually matter and how to nurture them without burning out. The app won a bunch of design awards and was created by therapists who understand that not everyone needs 47 group chats to feel fulfilled.

Here's what works: Schedule social time when your energy is highest (usually not after work), pick activities with built in structure (movie then dinner gives you conversation breaks), and don't stack social plans back to back. You're not flaky for needing recovery time between hangouts.

Also, find your ""introvert third spaces."" Not loud bars, think coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, hiking trails. Places where you can be around people without being ON. The book ""Quiet Power"" by Susan Cain (yes, her again, she's the introvert queen) has great frameworks for this.

# 3. Career Path: Play to Your Actual Strengths

The modern workplace is built for extroverts, open offices and constant collaboration and ""synergy."" Exhausting. But introverts have legit advantages. You're better at deep focus, independent problem solving, thoughtful communication, and pattern recognition. Leverage that instead of trying to out extrovert everyone.

Research from Wharton professor Adam Grant found introverts often make better leaders because they actually listen and empower their teams instead of dominating conversations. His work shows introverted CEOs of proactive teams had higher profits than their extroverted counterparts.

Negotiate for what you need: remote work options, quiet workspace, email communication over constant meetings, advance notice for presentations. Don't just suffer through. Companies are slowly realizing different work styles exist.

The book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" by Susan Cain is legitimately the best thing I've ever read on this. She's a former corporate lawyer who went through hell in extrovert dominated environments before researching this for years. The book hit #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and won multiple awards. It completely reframed how I see my work style.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI specialists from Google, it pulls from vetted sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to create podcasts tailored to your goals.

For introverts looking to build career skills or understand their wiring better, BeFreed lets you customize both the depth (10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples) and the voice style. The sarcastic narrator option makes dense psychology research way more digestible during your commute. You can type in something like ""become a better listener"" or ""understand introvert leadership styles,"" and it generates content specifically for that, complete with a structured learning plan that evolves based on what you engage with. The app includes all the books mentioned here plus tons more, and you can pause mid-podcast to ask questions or explore tangents. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous growth without the brain fog of doomscrolling.

Check out the YouTube channel ""Psych2Go"" too. They have solid science backed content on introvert strengths in professional settings, super digestible format.

# 4. Build a Recharge Routine That Actually Works

Your downtime needs to be intentional, not just scrolling TikTok for three hours (guilty). Actual recharging means activities that restore your mental energy without adding stimulation.

Try the app Finch for habit building. It's a self care pet game that's way less cringe than it sounds. You set personal goals, check in daily, and your little bird grows with you. It won a Mental Health America award and helps build consistency without being preachy.

Real recharge activities: Reading (obviously), journaling, solo walks, creative hobbies, meditation, cooking, basically anything that doesn't require performance or social energy. The podcast ""On Being"" with Krista Tippett explores solitude, meaning, and inner life in ways that actually resonate instead of just throwing generic mindfulness advice at you.

Here's the thing researchers found, constant stimulation literally shrinks your ability to be alone with your thoughts. Dr. Cal Newport's work on deep work and digital minimalism shows that protecting solitude isn't just nice, it's cognitively essential. His book ""Digital Minimalism"" breaks down how to reclaim your attention in a world designed to steal it.

# 5. Reframe How You See Yourself

Society pushes this narrative that extroversion equals success, happiness, popularity. It's bullshit. Different studies show introverts and extroverts report equal life satisfaction, just from different sources. Stop measuring yourself against extrovert metrics.

Your idea of a perfect weekend might look ""boring"" to others. Who cares? You're not living their life. Some of history's most impactful people were introverts: Einstein, Rosa Parks, Bill Gates, J.K. Rowling, Barack Obama. They succeeded because of their introverted traits, not despite them.

The YouTube channel ""The School of Life"" has incredible content on self acceptance and understanding your personality without judgment. Their philosophy is accessible, not academic, and helps you build frameworks for living authentically.

Stop trying to ""overcome"" introversion. It's not a flaw. It's literally how your brain is wired. The goal isn't to become an extrovert, it's to build a life that works with your natural tendencies. That means different things for everyone, but it starts with accepting that your way of being isn't wrong, it's just different.

The real freedom comes when you stop performing extroversion and start optimizing for your actual needs. Smaller friend groups, meaningful work, intentional solitude, strategic social energy. That's not settling, that's winning on your own terms.

You don't need to be louder, you need to be more yourself. The world needs what introverts bring: depth, thoughtfulness, creativity, genuine connection. Stop trying to fit into a mold that wasn't built for you and start building a life that actually feels good.",2,1767664846.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False
1q55hxf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q55hxf,New year haul,My first order from AllOuT arrived today. It was showing as sitting at customs for a few days then just magically showed up. Probably due to the holiday timing. Everything was unscathed and I even got a marzipan bar. I ate that after dinner and it's amazing. A thin dark chocolate shell and the slightly flavored marzipan (almond paste) was absolutely delicious. ,14,1767664780.0,MRE,4,0.95,False

1q55gcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q55gcx/the_longest_night_part_29_spooky_season/,The Longest Night Part 29 - Spooky Season,"Bloodshot had been the swollen eyes of Parent's whom had little chance to sleep. Slippers left to sluggishly shuffle across the kitchen floor. Clad within the wrinkled clothes of previous day, Lacking both energy and time to even change. Luke warm had been the bitter drink left sitting atop of a stove. More coal tossed into the fire, and bellows left squeezed to fan the flames that gave the bitter drink another chance to whistle.

Jack's presence would be known the moment he made his way across the kitchen floor. Feeling betrayed by the squeaking sound his little feet now made. Rubber pads sewn into the bottom of each foot that had been part of his wool pajamas. Left to stare upon an empty spot upon the kitchen counter.

""It's still early son, Milk man hasn't arrived yet, And it's too early for you to dress up."" Drained had been the voice of a man who struggled to speak with his usual fatherly tone.

Gaze that stared up at him, having been hidden behind the brim of the fitted fedora. One left tilted back by his mother, so the boy  could meet his father's gaze. Brief as it had been as he now walked away. Both left to stare upon the back of the fitted trench coat the boy had been wearing. Yawning had been his mother that tried to speak. ""Let the boy be, and come get your coffee before it burns.""

Softer thud the boy made as he took his usual spot before the Talking Box. Left to stare upon the small note that had been left, *Don't Feed Me!!!* Guess the thing inside didn't care for burnt toast. Seemed the thing inside knew The Detective well, for all the stories it had to tell. Having arrived just in time for another.

*📻 Last we heard The Hound had been left caught in the clutches of The Farmland Strangler!* Banging atop tables, tossing of chairs heard, ending with slamming against a door.

Knocking upon the front door heard. Voice of his father from the kitchen. ""Are we expecting anyone?""

*📻Look at the size of those hands folks! He's been caught and lifted by the top of his head! How could one man be this tall!*  Grunts heard of a man trying to free himself

""Goodness, who would show up this early on a Sunday."" His mother asked, His father giving a sigh as scraping of chair legs heard along the wooden floor. ""Maybe it's Dad, Only person I know that wouldn't be down at the church this time of day.""

*📻* Sound of cracking walnuts heard, one meant to simulate bone *Oh no! The horror! The Horror! This looks like the end folks! A sad day in. . . Wait! What's that over there! Can it be!?*

Clicking of a door being slow to open. Muffled had been words drowned by the Radio that play. Back and forth had it been before the door had been left to fully open, to let those that had been standing outside, in. Sound of footsteps leading into the kitchen as the boy had been staring up at the Talking Box.

*📻 It is!* Growls heard from the canine that leapt through an open window*. In the nick of time Rex has arrived! Oh look at him go! If you could only see what I see!* Vicious had been the growls and barking, Sound of ripping clothes.

""Coffee?"" His mother asked, One of the gentleman that entered had been quick to reply with a voice that seemed lacking any real distinction. ""No ma'am. We're just here to follow up on a few things, then we'll leave you to carry on with your morning.""

*📻* Sounds of countless footsteps heard rushing into the open barn. Man's Voice heard. ""We came as fast as we could, You were suppose to wait for backup to arrive!""  *Looks like the hound is really in for it now folks!*

Jack had now seen from the corner of his mother's eye, Having turned to  face towards the group that  stood  within the kitchen. Staring from his usual spot beside the radio. Rare for the boy to look elsewhere when the radio spoke. If one where to guess why, might of been because these two men had been dressed in a manor similar to The Detective. Maybe it had been that blank expression the two had plastered across their faces, An expression that would rival the boy's own. Just maybe, It had been the boy's own gaze that caught his attention, One that stared back from reflective lenses of their shades. 

*📻* Abrasive had been the voice that answered*. ""*If I had, that dame over there would of been left with more then a headache."" Flicking click of a lighter heard. 

Silent had been one that flipped through his reporter's notebook, Showing a page to the other that would lead the questioning. ""Have you seen anything out of the ordinary with any of the folks around town,? Maybe friends acting a bit strange as of late?

*📻* Sound of smoke being exhaled.  *Hear that kids? That's the sound of The Hound keeping his cool under pressure with a little help from his friends at Egyptian Deities! Get yours today!*

Family staying out late at night?, Strangers walking up to your neighbor's doors?"" Questions that seemed to raise some of their own. Both of his parent's left to look each other in the eye a moment, Expressions having perked up as if some alarm had been raised. 

""What do you mean, Out of the ordinary?"" His mother had been the first to ask. emotionless had been the voice that answer. ""Speaking in strange words, or new accent, Maybe seen them sneaking around after curfew?""

*📻 ""*Looks to me you're lucky that stray showed up before we did*.""* Sound of cuffs being heard clicking rapidly in the background. Dragging soon followed out the banging of barn doors*.*

""Any detail that feels  outside their usual behavior."" His father having been the one to answer. ""Nothing comes to mind no, It's a real ghost town after hours.""

*📻 Looks like they'll have there hands full getting that monster to fit in the back of the paddy wagon!*

Hesitant had been his father's voice that had been nearly a whisper. ""This. . . Doesn't have anything to do with what's happening over seas, does it?""

*📻* Abrasive was the voice ""The mutt's alright, Really saved my bacon this time. What'd you say, We go get a drink?""  Woofing of a canine heard.  ""I wasn't talking to you*.*

""Thank you for your time, We'll reach out if anything new comes up."" Reporters pad being flipped shut, Both having been made their way from the kitchen. To pause the moment they felt as if they had been watched. The kind that left these two looking opposite directions, With hands resting near their hips. The kind they didn't expect from the small kid that had been staring up at them from the floor. Just how many looks could be exchanged between all three of them.

*📻* Think I got something for you around here"" *Well would you look at that folks, Isn't that just the largest bone you ever seen!* 

""This must be that little hero that's the talk of the town."" Jack left face to face with the one that pretended to be The Detective, Once standing, now Squatting down in front of him.

*📻You heard it here first folks! Another cased closed! And Monster behind bars! Remember kids, Crime Never Pays!* Both Talking Box, and abrasive voice heard speaking as one. *""I'm watching you!""*

""Real Brave what you did, to put those monster's behind bars."" For the first time the one that had been taking notes spoke. Would of been hard to tell the difference had one not been watching his lips move. 

Both of his parent's having been keeping a close eye on those that now questioned their boy. His father not even bothering to look towards his mother that now handed him a cup of coffee. His mother not even looking towards his father as she did. Both left sipping, to watch from behind their mugs with a far more, hawk like gaze. 

""It's a real shame they had to take away all your candy, Since no one knows if it's safe to eat."" The other now spoke to finish his thought. ""If only we knew who to ask about it.""

Neither seeming to wait for the boy's answer. Instead the one that had been squatting down beside him  reached into one of his pockets, Pulling free a larger candy bar. One that had been named after one of old, one dressed for war. ""What's the matter kid? Don't want it?""

Both glanced at one another now, as the boy had only glanced upon the candy bar a moment, before looking back at the two of them. ""Looks like your parent's taught you well, not to take candy from strangers.""

Notepad having been flipped open, as the one still standing took a few notes, before he spoke. ""It's alright, We're friends of those nice men in blue from earlier this morning.""

Seemed both had started to take notice that something might of been slightly off with the kid they had been left to question. Question if he had been truly ok after his time spent alone with the skinner. None aware it had simply been the boy's usual behavior. Questions forgotten now that the small pup leapt from the boy's coat pocket that had been at his hip.  Pup left hanging by the skin of his teeth, Clamping down upon the candy bar this one trying to be The Detective held. Going so far as to now fall back upon the ground as the Detective had.

Clear the one that had been standing had gone to reach for something, That hadn't originally been the pocket watch tucked in, at his hip, To check the time before tucking it back behind the holster that had been hidden beneath his coat that had been brushed open. Laughter heard from the one that fell back, To watch the blank expression upon his very face shatter. First time showing a slight bit of emotion in his words. ""What's the little guy's name?""

Had been no hesitation in the boy's answer. ""Rex""

""Rex huh, Like that radio drama you've been listening to?"" Head turning to look up at the radio that had been playing in the back ground, one that had gone momentarily silent.

""Who want's to know?"" The one standing couldn't help but laugh the slightest at this kid trying to sound tough. ""Real cute, Kid.""

Took a few shakes, before Rex would fall free from the candy bar. Left chewing on the piece of paper that had been part of the wrapper. Pup left to stare up at the other man that managed to get back on his feet. ""That one is going to be a real handful, those kind always are.""

""Think we're done here, Enjoy what's left of your morning."" Both having left with a tip of their hats, pulling the front door shut behind them. Both waiting until they had left the neighborhood to share with one another just what they had been thinking. ""What do you think? Parent's Involved?""

""No"" Bite from the candy bar taken.

""What about the kid?"" Left flipping through the notebook of his.

""Need more time, Couldn't get a proper read."" Chewing heard between words. 

""Neither could I, Maybe bring in him for some questioning involving that case, Something doesn't add up."" Left flipping a few times through the notes he had taken.

""Which part?"" Last of the candy bar stuffed between his lips.

""All of it, If we go by the profile The Detective made after questioning the kid, It just get's stranger. We got missing cases popping up going back several generations, And more keep falling out of the wood work."" Note book snapped shut, tucked away as a different one would be pulled free. ""Would have to be a family of these bastards, Passing it on to one generation to the next.""

""What's strange about that? Didn't we just wrap up something similar back east?"" Notepad of his own being pulled from a vest pocket. 

""Difference is, more people you have involved, more sloppy they get, more mistakes they make and more things for us to find. . . But this? How did this go on for so long without anyone connecting the dots?""

""We still don't even know what weapon, or method was used to  remove the skin without causing any damage, Mistook the one we got for a rubber suit at first."" This man left running his hand towards the back of his head, scratching at it a bit in frustration.

""And you're telling me, some one able to do all that, go under the radar for so long just decides one day to up and turn himself in? Serving us the key witness while they're at it on a silver platter?""

""Think the kid's lying?"" Flipping of pages heard. Neither looking at one another as they spoke, and made their way through an empty town. 

""No matter how much I try to think about it rationally, Something keeps nagging at me he isn't.  Feels like we're just not getting the full picture. Until I get a chance to question those two at Danvers, Keep them locked up for now.""  

Any word if that skinny one woke up yet, What was his name?"" Flipping through the notebook, unable to find the name.

""Billy"" Other had been quick to answer, not even needing to bother to look at his notes, seeming to continue on where the other left off. ""Not sure there is anything left in there to wake up."" 

""They ever figure out he's still alive? With most of his brain having been left turned to to the collapsed skull, Some friend of his. . . What was his name again?"" Smaller notebook snapping shut, and tucking away. 

""Earl, Hard to stomach even looking at him, now that his skin slid right off him."" This man trying not to look over at what was left of a cow hanging from the butcher shop window. 

""Think he did it to himself? I don't buy the theory those doctor's came up with. Saying it was a result of rapid weight loss, and clawing at his own spine."" Note pad handed off

""If he did, would of needed help from some one close to him, and would of had to of been before he even turned himself in."" 

""You try asking him?"" The one he'd been asking stopped dead in his tracks, turning towards him now, as he had been forced to stop all the same. ""Several of us tried, All he ever does is stare at you with those large blood shot eyes, Jaw left to hang open, now that his cheeks are gone.""

""Whatever muscle looking to have gone brittle and snapped, being left exposed in the air and all. If it wasn't for that ice box they shoved him in, He would of rotted away by now."" First time he had ever seen his partner shaken. ""Whoever did this to him, They make our guys look like amateur's at best.""

""Would of been a bit poetic, If he turns out to be a skinner."" Hand placed upon his shoulder. ""We'll see if you can say that, once you've had a chance to see it yourself."" 

""What about that other one? The one they originally thought to be involved in that grizzly business up north?"" Sound of singing heard from within the church they passed by. ""Set free, now that they found all those missing loggers up in that tree, No way the two of them could of done all that, even if they hadn't been in custody at the time.""

""They still can't figure out an exact time, ""Localized cold snap"" they say. They really want us to believe that line of"" 

Other one cutting him off. ""Any luck tracking down that officer? The one everyone said snapped, after taking a look down that hole no one has managed to find?"" 

They hadn't been far off from the station now. ""Been meaning to ask about that, No matter who we ask, no one seems to know the guy. everyone is accounted for, Only one listed KIA was Deputy Williams."" 

""Think we need to focus more on trying to find whoever it was then, that dropped the two off at Danvers. I want you"" Cut off now that they both made there way up the steps of the station. ""It'll have to wait, Let's get what we came for and be on our way."" 

Yelling heard from within long before they even made their way inside. The Detective having been left chewing out another officer that had been left to take the brunt of it. ""The hell do you mean they might plan to set those two free?! They should both be left to hang for what they've done!"" 

Seemed The Detective's face had found a new shade of red this time around. Started to be felt cursed to never sleep, Having been given the call over the police radio moment he rolled into his drive way. Couldn't of been gone more then twenty minutes for all hell to break loose. ""Nothing we can do about it Jack, Word came down from above, Frank went down to city hall to try and sort out all this mess."" 

Seemed it wasn't the first time this officer had been left to deal with the Detective that looked damn near blinded by his own rage. Funny how it was the only time his eyes ever opened wider then a squint. Bad timing for the two that had just stepped into the place.

""god damnit!, What more do you spooks want!, You already took the only lead we had in solving that kid's abduction case!"" Each left to give the other a side eye from beneath their reflective shades, ones left to drip with spittle from The Detective's rage. 

""Mind telling us who else came by?"" Fist left to slam down upon the desk beside them, Detective left to point. ""The same Bastards that came sniffing around last night! Had enough of your little games then, I'll be damned if I take part in them now!"" 

Question if The Detective had been playing a few games of his own, As all parties had been left silently eyeing one another. How quick The Detective had been to clear his head as he spoke in a manor that almost felt like the calm before the storm. ""If you want anything out of me, or anyone else here, You'll need to hand over the candy you took right out from beneath our nose."" 

Seemed these two hadn't come to play games, Not the way they now carried themselves as they moved out of earshot of others. ""Mind telling me just what the hell is going on?"" 

Left alone now to talk in Frank's office. ""Despite what you might think Detective, We are the only ones assigned to this matter, And we've only just arrived just before dawn.""

Other flipping open a note pad, pencil in hand as he spoke. ""This is the first we've stepped foot in this place, now mind telling us just what these others looked like?

""We'll see about returning some of that evidence of yours, once we have this all sorted out.""  The other spoke once more, having pulled out a note pad of his own. 

""The two of you bastards really want me to believe a damn word you're say?  I know how your type likes to operate, And until I see the evidence, I ain't buying any of this horse shit you're trying to spoon feed me."" Sweeter was the smoke that followed the snap of a light.

Cold had been the tone of the man that now spoke. ""I don't know who you think we are Detective, Or what you think you know about us. It would be safe to say whatever it is you think you know, Is the type of thing you should keep to yourself. As it would be in the best interest of all parties involved. 

This had been the part where everyone would shake hands, come to an agreement between gentlemen and everyone would part with a mutual understand. Even how The Detective had made two new friends that he wanted his son to meet. Least this had been the story his mother told him when his father had been left to help his dad through the door. Broken and battered had been The Detective finally given a chance to rest, passed out in His Father's favorite chair not far from where the Radio had been left to rest. Radio that continued to share tales with the boy that sat planted in front of The Detectives feet. The pup left gnawing upon one of the shoe laces, Having crawled into one of the Detective's discarded shoes. Brief were these fleeting moment's of peace, that never managed to last.

Our story is soooo Complex I’m 26F and he’s 25M, like I don’t even know where to start but I’ll try to make it short.

We started off friends in the same friend group in 2020. 

Officially together in 2021-2023. We broke up because in our first month of being together he has a secret kink and paid for pics/videos of it instead of exploring it with me. I was young and held a grudge about it, it was unhealthy so I broke up with him to see if he’d go back and he did. 

2 years later. 

We rekindled in 2025, I didn’t wanna start off a relationship with trust issues from our past but I knew I loved and wanted him, I wanted us to start off right and strong, because I loved our relationship and i wanted to see if he truly changed. He said he understood and he fully agreed on showing me how much he feels the same way so it was the entire year of being in an exclusive situation building trust together-and he definitely showed that he changed, he wasn’t buying nothing, wasn’t online, there was nothing. Not even deleting stuff it definitely felt soo good and I was finally happy.. 

But one day he bought me flowers, breakfast and coffee, and two days after he goes and sleeps with a coworker unprotected, he pretty much cheated and betrayed our agreement. He blindsided me badly making me believe everything was okay between us while he didn’t feel okay and slept with another, Everyone knew we were  “together” even his coworkers and his entire job besides this new coworker who he slept with. 

He said he felt in the gray-area, that we were stagnant and not gonna get anywhere since I was the one who said I wasn’t ready. He admitted it was wrong and that doesn’t excuse what he did and he takes full accountability for it, he said he was just explaining why he justified it in his head but admits that was entirely wrong and he swears if we were official he would’ve never done this he just felt we never would be since the ball was in my court and he always messed up in the past. He was the one who confessed himself the night he did it, he looked very sick and like he was crying, I never caught him, it was just out of no where. 

as he told me he hated what he did so badly and was so disgusted with what he’d just done he had to tell me himself so he could atleast have somewhat of a chance to show real remorse and so he could take full responsibility to show me he will change and be better for me because he wants me and wants to be a better man for me. He said he wished he communicated with me first, he doesn’t know why he was soo into his head and he will never do that again because he doesn’t ever wanna see me put in this pain by his hands again and said he would do anything in his power to go back in time as he deeply regrets what he did. 

We decided to heal together officially, I want to be with him. It just sucks I went through that whole year of building myself for him, me being loyal and faithful to him this entire time and he just dropped that whole building year for one night with a coworker. I know he regrets it and I can see true remorse in him but I just feel so sick that he dropped us and gave up over feelings in his own head that he justified instead of just communicating. 

It’s like all the words he said in that whole year just got erased in one day, all of our building all of our memories don’t feel like I thought they felt. I’m grieving a lot. I’m happy with him, but sad in how our future now is.. I know I made this choice and being together means I have to move on eventually and I am trying. I just feel like talkin about it does help me in some way to not bottle up. ",4,1767664625.0,survivinginfidelity,2,1.0,False

While traveling alone in Istanbul, I was sitting at a coffee shop when a man struck up a conversation with me. He presented himself as a business owner and mentioned that he also owned a hotel. I told him I was looking at Airbnb listings, and he offered to show me a property.

He later offered me accommodation at a discount, and I ended up staying at his hotel for a while.

During that time, nothing inappropriate happened at first, except for one moment where he tried to hug me and immediately backed off when I said I wasn’t comfortable with it. Because of that, and because nothing else happened initially, I didn’t feel unsafe in the beginning — which is part of why this situation is so confusing for me.

Later on, toward the end of my stay, he **removed my clothing without my consent** at his hotel terrace. There was no clear discussion or agreement beforehand. I didn’t say yes. I didn’t initiate anything. I was shocked and froze, and I felt unable to speak or react in the moment.

Afterward, I went into denial. I think I was trying to convince myself that nothing bad had happened because I didn’t know how to process it. I was alone, dependent on the situation, and felt completely voiceless. At one point, he even framed things in a transactional way, which made me feel more disturbed rather than reassured.

I’m not trying to name or accuse anyone publicly. I’m genuinely trying to understand **whether this counts as sexual assault**, especially in situations involving power imbalance, shock, and denial.

If anyone has insight, personal experience, or advice on how to process something like this, I would really appreciate hearing it.

It’s the longest we’ve been in no contact. The last time was 2 months exactly, when I had moved across the country for a few months, and I reached out to thank him for taking care of my friend who needed to get home safely from the bar. 

Before I left for that move, I wrote him about a dozen “open when” letters. 

When it’s your birthday, when you’re feeling down, when you’re thinking about me, etc. 

When I moved back, we picked up where we left off - but no label. I noticed he had kept the box of those letters, but threw out the rest of our momentos from over the years. 

We ended things again pretty quickly after starting up again. That was four months ago. Every few weeks after our break up, we met up for coffee, which eventually turned into sleeping together. I noticed the box had now moved to the top of his desk, but with no letters opened still.

The last time we saw each other, it felt different. I was always the one begging him, but this time he was the one nervously reaching out to me to see if I would get coffee with him or hang out and said he just wanted to spend time with me. I was a bit colder, less attached. Or more numb, who knows. 

It’s now been two months. I saw him for a fleeting five minutes at a friend’s birthday yesterday.  I can’t help but wonder if he’s picked up one of those letters. 

His birthday was Christmas Eve. The still attached portion of myself hopes that he’s opened that box and thought of me. But the realistic side of me acknowledges that he most likely has thrown them away. His pattern is to always come back, but it’s always fueled by proximity. 

I made a point this time to cut off his brother and his brother‘s wife who used to be my best friend for the sake of me healing. Having no contact has been so painful, but I have to say… It’s not more painful than lying awake next to him wondering what I need to change so that he loves me. It’s not more painful than wondering which of his exes he’s checking up on when I’m not around.

I miss him loads, but no contact this time is different than the first time we did this.  It’s more of an accepting form of grief. I miss him, but not enough to plot no contact to get him back the same way I hoped to last time.

1q553at,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1q553at/middecember_trip_highlights_and_lowlights/,Mid-December Trip - Highlights and Lowlights,"Hey All

I just came back from one of my most amazing vacations of all time. Did a road trip through the west of CR and it was a trip of a lifetime. My circuit was the following, which I did over the course of 12 days:

Fortuna/Arenal -> Rio Celeste -> Monteverde -> Manuel Antonio -> Osa/Corcovado -> Bahia Ballena -> Santa Maria de Dota.

  
I wanted to share some recommendations of what I loved and what was not up to the mark/underwhelming:

  
**Underrated/blew my mind:**

\- El Silencio: One of my favorite hikes I did in the country. Breathtaking view of Arenal and lots of wildlife spottings (for a dense rainforest) and very few people. Moderate loop through rainforest, lava flow and cattle ranches.

\- Los Lagos Resort: Unlike other hot spring resorts, this is ON the volcano, literally on the edge of it. Amazing pools and springs, and it's got its own private trails, mirador and lakes. I am so glad I could snag a room in this place. 

\- The drive from Tilaran to Monteverde: For some reason, Waze directed me to this path instead of the more commonly taken route. This was a scary drive, specially around late afternoon, dusk and I had to white knuckle sections of it, full of steep one lane dirt roads. You're essentially driving over a high mountain ridge. Luckily, not a lot of traffic. On the other hand, exquisite breathtaking sunset views over the Nicoya peninsula and expansive beautiful valleys around. Best part of the drive, an ocelot or (or a jaguarundi, not sure which) darted across the road right in front of us.

\- Playa Espadilla, Manuel Antonio: Better beach for swimming than the national park. Soft sand, calm water with the temps of a warm bath with breathtaking sunsets. Easy access to vendors/bars selling beer and cocktails.

\- Corcovado National Park: This is THE national park that you'd want to go to to see most wildlife. To say that this place is teeming with wildlife would be an understatement. We took a day tour and saw at least 20 different unique animal species, from 3 types of monkeys, multiple exotic birds, crocs, snakes, two types of sloths, coati families, and so on. Will definitely plan to be back for the overnight trip.

\- Coopedota Coffee Tour and the town of Santa Maria: I am a (specialty) coffee nerd, and this was my first tour of a coffee farm. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the farm to cup process and I also did a cupping tour in the cafe to try out the specialty coffee. I explicitly made sure to avoid the touristy coffee tours that are recommended and I am glad I picked this one. The town (Santa Maria de Dota) where this is located in is also an amazing place to stay and it's very peaceful and laid back, and its an amazing drive to get to it (if you're driving from the south via highway 2, not from San Jose). 

  
**Met my expectations/thoroughly enjoyed:**

\- Selvatura hanging bridges and ziplines, Monteverde: Probably the most touristy thing we did all trip, but it was very worth it. Amazing views of the cloud forest and canopies, and managed to even spot toucans and monkeys.

\- Drake bay trail: Did the section between Las Caletas and the mouth of Rio Claro. Saw macaws, spider monkeys, toucans. Beatiful views of the coastline and plenty of swimmable beaches, but I especially enjoyed swimming in the river mouth (be careful of riptides if you do this).  

\- Marino Ballena National Park: Exquisite white sand beach. Spent a whole day here, swimming and wading to the whale's tail. Unlike other parks they allow you to carry food/drinks in with you, so do so and have a nice picnic here! 

\- Nauyaca falls: Very popular and touristy but there is so many spots to swim and chill here. Both the operators that organize the tours have good facilities and are well run. 

  
**Overrated:**

\- Fortuna waterfall: Steep entry fees for a waterfall that is not very swimmable and is packed to the gills with crowds. There are 100s of waterfalls across the country that you could access for a fraction of the cost.

\- El Refugio night tour, Monteverde: They pack this with people. There are literally 100s of people at a given time shining spotlights across the trees in this tiny park and you're pushing through so many people at a time to get to a spot. A lot of guides that are not very knowledgeable and rush you through the trails. While we did see some wildlife, the experience wasn't enjoyable. 

\- Monteverde Reserve: Probably my most unpopular opinion on this post, but I had high expectations of this place but this didn't meet any of it. I barely saw any wildlife (except for a lone coati) and I saw more walking the private trail of my Airbnb (on the border of the reserve) than here. I get that they want to limit crowds here, but the fact that you need to pay $30 a pop to stick to a specific marked section of the park makes it not worth it at all.



**Restaurants I loved:**

\- Soda La Fuente, Bagaces: Hit this on my way from Liberia Airport to Fortuna. Some of the best casados we've had in the trip. Would recommend the shredded beef casado and beef brisket empanada.

\- La Chifa Familia Feliz, La Fortuna: Amazing family restaurant with some of the best food I've had on the trip, run by a very passionate chef. If this was in a big city, this would have been a michelin/bib gourmand rated.

\- Choco Cafe, Monteverde: Best desserts I've had on this trip. Tres leches and coconut flan were amazing.

\- Casemcoop, Monteverde: Stopped for lunch after a hike. Tried the chorreada and Olla de carne, both of which were delicious. Also the cheapest souvenirs I found all across the country, with the best quality in the adjoining gift shop.

\- Magic Bus Restaurant, Manuel Antonio: Generous and flavorful portions and great seafood. The arroz con mariscos is a must try.

\- Terraba, Ojochal: Best ceviche I've had on the trip. Recommend the surf and turf as well. Note: If you're staying in this area, most of the restaurants are bougie overpriced gringo establishments that you should avoid.

I quit smoking a few months ago and have heavily limited alcohol, caffeine, and dairy. Symptoms have improved a bit but not drastically. I’d imagine part of the problem is my love for incredibly spicy food. I’m the kind of person who puts hot sauce on everything. To be honest, I’m not sure if I can let this go. Alcohol and Coffee were hard enough, but spicy food is genuinely one of my favorite things about life. Can anyone else relate? Could medication allow me to continue eating spicy food?

1q54yen,https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/1q54yen/how_would_you_balance_act_4_around_getting_a/,How would you balance Act 4 around getting a third boss relic after Act 3?,"I've been thinking about it recently for fun, and I'm curious how you all would balance Act 4 around getting a third boss relic. As is, the game is perfectly beatable with only two boss relics, so a third would boost your power a ton. In addition to that, a lot of the downsides of most energy relics are completely gone if you get them after Act 3. Ecto and Busted Crown are instantly top tier, Sozu's not bad, Coffee Dripper and Fusion Hammer are even more amazing. The only energy relics that I can think of that still has a downside (though less so since there are fewer fights) is Mark of Pain, Philosopher's Stone, Velvet Choker, and Sozu kind of. 

So, two rounds: How would you balance Act 4 around a third boss relic?

Round 1: Nothing about the Act 4 Map can change, it's still Campfire, Shop, Elite, and Heart. Everything else is fair game.

  
Round 2: Act 4 map is yours to mess with.

For round 1, I was thinking: what if no previous boss relics were available and there were boss relics that you can only get after Act 3? Some ideas I had, with little thought to overall balance, are: A relic that gives you an extra energy per turn, but you replace all removed cards over the course of the run (strikes, defends, curses, etc..) A relic that gives you an extra energy per turn, but you unupgrade all upgraded cards. A relic that gives you an extra energy per turn, but you get Mark of the Bloom and start each combat with 99 Vulnerable that cannot be wiped away. I know the balance here is off, but just throwing out some ideas.

For round 2, I figure a good bet would be to just make Act 4 a real act, where everything funnels into the Shield and Spear fight into the Heart.

1q54yar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q54yar,Why are my levels so bad.,"(See 2 labs acreen shots above) I just ordered a Lp(a)-Lipoprotein(a) Test and more extensive Thyroid test (the one include was just the one level). My insulin level was in the normal range. 

Post menopausal female - I work out cardio and bands (alternating muscle groups) 5 days per week. Walk at least 15-20 minutes at least 2 times per day with dogs. Plus short walks.

Fats:

I put 1 tablespoon of heavy cream- 2 cups of coffee and 1 teaspoon of organic butter in each cup. 2 eggs. 

Other than that, my husband did tell me he thinks he’s been buying fatty meat when he goes to the store and will start picking up more chicken and lower fat red meat for me Could changing the fattier meats  get these levels low enough to be normal? We did go for a while while we were really doing more carnivore, but we’ve started adding vegetables and I’d say the past eight months to a year. We probably eat vegetables 3 to 4 times a week when we’re being consistent, but we just went through a crisis and really dropped the ball. I’ve also been unbelievably stressed out since November.

If I eat lunch it’s not heavy, it’s often 1-2 pieces of organic cheese or two with two organic turkey slices. Sometimes it could be a few pieces of air fried chicken, wings or legs. Possibly a half an avacado - appx 5 days week. Greek yogurt 5 days per week. Just started chia seeds. Banana (I know is high sugar converting fruit) and so I usually have 1/2 appx of one 4 days per week.

If I eat dessert it’s at most 1x per week. If bread or pasta, 1 time per week with a protein.

Whole milk - 1 cup per day.

The garnish is a microplaned coffee bean — careful not to microplane your fingers!

I made this because it looked fun and I had whipping cream to use up from holiday baking, and I was surprised by just how much I liked it. I was a little worried about how well the Cynar was going to blend, but it ended up just giving this lovely earthy note that I wouldn’t have been able to identify as Cynar if I hadn’t known it was in there.

1q54vvy,https://i.redd.it/y3xcvz18umbg1.jpeg,11 Decantbox mini reviews: Buy✅ or Pass❌,"These reviews are based solely on scent and quality. Can’t speak to performance just yet. ❌ signals indifference or a hard pass. ✅ indicates me foaming at the mouth to purchase a full bottle.

1) Hawas Viper 🐍 - the first Hawas I wasn’t immediately wow’d by. Opens with a blast of alcohol before settling into its warm, spicy tobacco profile with musky undertones. Smells just how its bottle looks. They say there’s a cannabis note in the front, but it’s more like some dry ass Reggie Bush rolled up in a dutchie. Not even that dank shit lol. I also get a bit of coffee and cinnamon in the back. The quality is definitely there, it’s nicely blended, but this profile will have to grow on me ❌

2) Game of Spades Moon 🌙 - opens up very synthetic for maybe 30 seconds, then blossoms into this sweet, syrupy, bouquet of flowers with caramel drizzled on the petals. The florals really prevent it from smelling like the diabetic mess I thought it’d be. Now, I’ve never sampled NY Nights, but this is enough for me to save the money and stand by it ✅

3) Spectre Ghost 👻- very high quality, smells exactly like Nishane Ani from what I can remember. The ginger punches you in the face before the bergamot and vanilla tag team you. The vanilla ends up putting you in a sleeper hold, though. Good fragrance for the moment, but I don’t see myself committing to a full bottle. Too sweet for my taste. Plus I’m growing tired of vanilla bombs ❌

4) Fragrance World Soir 🍨 - another vanilla bomb, this time supported by spicy amber, and some weird funk in the background, giving it that “churchy” vibe. Opening is a little suspect, but the dry down is 1:1 with Grand Soir. Easy buy if that’s your sort of thing, as this one is pure CLASS. However, too sweet and somehow, too mature for me also ❌

5) Teriaq Intense 🥃 - now THIS is how you do the Khamrah DNA, Lattafa!! The plum liquor adds so much depth to the linear OG profile and enhances the quality tremendously. The vanilla is more subdued here and won’t have you smelling like a cheap candle. Perfect balance of boozy, spicy, and sweet accords. Pure sex ✅

6) Al Haramain Carbon Edition 💈 - Nicholas packed this up for me instead of Afnan Rare Carbon by mistake, but it’s all good. This is Cool Water/GIT on steroids. Completely blows Tres Nuit away and worth the premium. Nails that vintage barbershop vibe dead on. That lavender and rosemary is so addictive, has me feeling like I’m at the beach with a fresh haircut ✅

7) French Avenue Atlantis 🍉 - three words: watermelon jolly ranchers. The coconut is peeking out in the back, but overall, it’s very candy-like and feminine leaning. I probably wouldn’t wear this, but it’s worthy of a buy for the wife at least ✅

8) Armaf Dubai Chocolate 🍫 - super sweet, photorealistic chocolate pistachio wafer. Think Mandarin Sky without the orange notes, but rather coffee in its place. Outstanding quality for what it is, just not for me ❌

9) Lataffa Dynasty 🌿 - definitely the most polarizing and unique of this haul. Quite hard to describe other than airy, fresh, with just the right amount of “zing” from the ginger and roobios tea notes. That said, it’s not as groundbreaking as I hoped. For those who do love it, this would make a solid year round dumb reach. Not a safe blind-buy, don’t get your hopes up ❌

10) Maison Asrar Faris Al Arab 🍁 - first and only Blonde Amber inspo I’ve tried. Boozy cherry vanilla and oriental cashmere greets you in the opening, followed by sugary amber and tonka bean atop a musky base. Reminds me of a more nuanced, less sweet take on Grand Soir’s profile. This thing’s got layers. Very mature, yet wearable imo. I don’t think it’s worth anywhere near Clive Christian money, but this rendition sure is a viable piece to my collection ✅

11) Maison Asrar Muharib 🪻🍯 - this is it. THIS is the Naxos clone you’ve all been searching for! WOW.

I’m a bit confused and afraid; that’s why I wanted to tell my story and hear your thoughts (found in the internet that this may be the perfect place to discuss this.) 

WARNING ⚠️ THIS IS LOONG TO READ

Until some time ago, I’ve always felt myself to be straight—not bi or anything. I never had any thoughts or anything i can think of.

It’s been years since I’ve been a manager at a company. It is always me: a tad bit lazy, a tad bit egocentric, and always hanging by a thread. I recently got divorced, and I’ve been having affairs and casual sex with women for some time. I'm 37 years old and ""sexcapades"" have sort of been my thing for years.

At work, I’ve always been superficial with people and have behaved somewhat unpredictably. A few years ago, a young guy joined my team—very resilient and attentive. He got all the promotions because he can solve anything; he literally seems like someone who cannot stop evolving in the business world. Since the beginning, he has been a very unique worker.

At first, I just thought he was a smart guy with a weird personality (he always has distinct perspectives, keeps a dynamic distance from people, and he’s funny but very ironic with seemingly high self-esteem). Throughout the years, I’ve had him challenge me in discussions and sometimes save my ass in important meetings or business decisions. The guy even managed to learn programming just to fix a tool at work that wasn’t syncing properly.

Throughout the years, he’s covered many roles we needed him to, and that made me travel with him a lot to different sites in the country. He never agreed to drive—I always drive—not because he doesn’t know how. We always talk a lot during long trips; we’re totally different people, from music tastes to movies, hobbies, and seriousness. Despite that, I’ve always enjoyed his company and always brought him with me while visiting sites. The drive is a rollercoaster of things, from debates to jokes and yelling, etc. Every drive made me get to know him more.

Everyone loves him as a colleague, but they try anything to trash him since, as long as he’s around, it’s obvious nobody else is getting promoted. Every day I get complaints about him, and although they’re unfair complaints, I always try to run some of them by him. He shuts me down and sort of makes me fully regret it every time. I know they were irrelevant complaints to begin with, but because I get shut down, it pushes me to confront him even though I know they’re baseless 95% of the time.

Though, since the beginning, the guy has always been more attentive than others in my life; he has always noticed when I’ve been stressed or unwell, or asks me if he can do anything to help out. Honestly, I’ve always felt like talking to him and have received good advice, although he’s about nine years younger than me. While he’s always setting boundaries when I say something more than I should—or when I am more ""approaching""—I’ve noticed that he sort of gets me better than most people.

When he got promoted to Business Analyst (Current Role), a friend (outside work) who knew about him told me he was gay. Since then, a weird thing has been getting to me.

He’s still him, but once I knew he was gay, I started to look at him differently. I felt like I understood him better. I noticed myself staring at him more than I used to, and it’s not for nothing: the guy is blondish with blue eyes, manly features, and a nice beard. He is always not giving a shit about the room—fully confident but not showing off. I’ve noticed how modest and interesting he looks and behaves. He’s always calm and positive; once you poke him a bit, he gets back at you real quick either through irony and sarcasm or by challenging you back. He is oddly revengeful and ""shutdown-y.""

We talk sometimes on WhatsApp, mainly for work, but I’d slip in other discussions too. He’s always in the mood and will say funny stuff that always makes me laugh. It’s weird that he has no social media accounts, just WhatsApp and iMessage. We’ve literally had long discussions about it since it’s very unusual in our country to find a young guy who has no social media presence at all. He seems to have grown tired of it many years ago and has deleted them all. I’ve noticed even his phone is without a passcode; how crazy is that in this era?

Lately, we’ve had to work more closely together and I have enjoyed it a lot. I noticed he’s enjoying it too. I’ve seen him actually like my behavior and comment on it. Since then, I’ve started to get turned on by him. And it was not that I wasn’t having sex, because I was having sex regularly, but when he was around, I’d feel it. I had never seen him in shorts before, but this summer we went on a team-building trip to the mountains and I couldn’t look at him without feeling something. There were other coworkers around, but I noticed I wouldn’t pay much attention to them; although I was drinking beers and engaging, I would be aware of him.

It is a weird thing that whenever he was around, I’d always feel funny afterward. This went on until I was invited to his birthday party. I felt extremely happy to get invited, as I was the only one from work to get that invitation. We’re talking about someone who always keeps work separate from his life; it gave me the thought that I meant something to him, although we have lots of debates and fights at work.

With the thought that I meant something to him as well, I attended the party. I bought him a nice gift I knew he would like because he’s all-in on the Apple ecosystem. He had the company make an exception and allow him to use a MacBook he brought, where no one else has been able to do better than those standard business Windows laptops of the company.

When I was at the party, he looked very happy I attended; he even felt close to me in comparison to his friends (which I’d assumed wouldn’t be the case). I had feared a bit that I would feel left out, mainly because his personality is different from mine, so his friends would be more like him as well. I mean, I’m famous for saying some weird stuff that I think is funny, but other people just find it cringe or ""too much""—mainly inappropriate sexualized jokes or things a tad bit out of taste.

Nevertheless, I felt good. He presented me at the party as his boss (which gave me a bit of a bad taste, although I was no longer a boss to him because he’s on a parallel scale of the org chart). But after that, he presented me to his friends with some nice words and described our closeness very positively; he even said more nice things about me than I’d expected.

Everything went great. We had a lot of fun and lots of drinks. I got to see him even outside work settings; he’s always that type of mature-minded, funny, but well-kept guy. His friends were nice as well. Although I am nine years older than him, I wasn’t the oldest guy at the party as I had feared. There was a wide range of ages at that party and it felt great.

I had one too many drinks, and when the party was over and everybody was going home, he insisted he would take me home. Although I was saying no, I was hoping he would insist to the point that I couldn’t say no. After the second insistence, he just grabbed my arm, gave me a firm look, and just took me, walking outside. He arranged for a friend of his who hadn’t drunk alcohol to take my car and drive it to my place.

Once we were in the car and we drove off, I don’t remember exactly what I said to him because it was long, but it was something along the lines of: “I never knew you considered me this close!” I remember him smiling and saying that he never knew I was such a drinker, and we laughed at that. The drive was silent, and I would sometimes stare at him.

When we arrived at my place, his friends who had my car hadn’t yet arrived, so we were inside his car waiting. He thanked me for the gift and said that it was the best gift he received for his birthday, but that I didn’t have to. Me, being the asshole that I am, instead of saying something minimal about it, went on to say that it would suck a lot if he didn’t like it. He asked me why.

I didn’t know what to say to that. I tried to say something but didn’t, but I felt like I had to answer... so I just grabbed his neck and kissed him. I was totally nervous, afraid of a bad reaction, and fearing I might get fired (the workplace doesn’t allow that). I was unsure of what I was doing, but I still kept my lips hanging there for a few seconds against his unmoving lips. Then I just got out of the car and closed the door. His friend with my car came, so I took my keys and ran to the building.

From that moment until the next morning, I can’t describe how I felt or what thoughts I had—the best and the worst thoughts one can have, mixed together with a rollercoaster of emotions. But when I arrived at work, he just behaved normally. That sucked because I didn’t have the guts to discuss what I had done, and I was sort of hoping he’d say something about it or leave a hint. He never did say anything or leave a hint. Which sucked!

I don’t know what I was expecting, what I wanted, or how, but I was always hoping he’d leave a hint. His behavior, though, was the same as it was before his birthday party. This left me hanging onto something I was not sure about. I never had any experience with men to know what to do; in our country, gay people stay hidden, so I had never seen how guys behave in situations like this. There is nobody I can ask for advice. It is a shitty place/sitation to be.

A few days ago, before Christmas, we had to go on a four-hour drive to another site of the company. He didn’t have to come, but I wanted him with me like I always do, so I found the guts to ask him. As always, he was positive about it. The drive started awfully. I didn’t know what to say, and he wasn’t saying much. It was early morning, about 07:20. We stopped at a coffee shop 15 minutes after the drive started, and we mainly stayed silent until I came up with the weirdest, most awful shit—the most unnecessary thing to say. I talked about a gay personality on TV who was accused of sleeping with people who wanted to get on his show. He looked at me while smiling and said: “You say the weirdest things, man!” My face went silent, as if to say, ""Yeah, I know I do."" You’d think I’d shut up, but no; I look at him and say that I’ve never met a gay person in real life. He smiles, continues to smoke his cigarette, and shouts really loudly at me—like the loudest voice I’ve ever heard: “I’m gayyyy!” Then he just got up and we went to the car so we could continue on the road.

It was a solid, quiet drive; neither of us said anything. It was a shitty traffic day; some morons had a stupid accident on a roundabout, causing major delays. I had started to get a bit nervous, and he put a cigarette in my mouth and lit one for himself. Everything felt great, and I was thinking about how much I enjoy even the little things he does. For some minutes, I just enjoyed the driving and the company.

Later down the road, he got a call. Although it was a short call, the words he used were very unspecific and vaguely worded; I couldn’t understand what call that was. A minute after he hung up, I couldn’t resist asking who he was talking to. He just took a look at me and firmly said: “Wouldn’t you like to know!” I smiled. From there, he asked me: “What?” but in a calm voice. Taking advantage of a red light—and having thought about it the whole drive since he got in the car—I just grabbed his neck, pulled him next to me, and kissed him. This time it felt different; it looked like he collaborated in it. A horn from the car behind us honked, and we both moved back. I drove off as the light was obviously green. In that moment, I started to realize that neither of us could leave that car; there was no escape for me like last time. Badly enough, he wasn’t saying anything. I tried to break the silence but, obviously being me, I went and said the wrong stuff every time it mattered. I remember talking about a discount in a famous store we have in the country. He just looked at me and asked me to shut up for the next 10 minutes it would take to arrive at our destination.

In hindsight, I took that request to shut up very oddly, as I kissed him again after I parked the car and just opened the door and left. He stayed inside for a minute. I went and entered the site; he later entered as well. Both of us went about our business at the site and for a few hours weren’t in contact at all. By 2 p.m., I went to him and invited him for lunch. He said: “I think I ate twice for the day, that’s gotta be enough. Maybe when we get back I’ll get something!” So I just went out of his sight, figuring he was avoiding me.

By 4 p.m., we started driving back to our city. He seemed normal, like nothing had happened, and I went along. We discussed work on the way home and trashed some people at work. When I dropped him off at his building, we were having some small talk as a goodbye and he said: “Thought I’d eat three times today, but it seems two was enough!”.

The next day at work, nothing much happened as we had an audit and were heavily loaded with work. Then the weekend came along and he started his vacation—two and a half weeks visiting his niece abroad. While thinking about what happened that day we visited the other site, I started to wonder: did he say “I ate twice and that’s enough for the day, maybe later I’ll get something” because I had kissed him twice and he was hoping for a third kiss on the drive home? The “I thought I’d eat three times today, but I guess two is enough!” kind of leaves me no other option than arriving at the conclusion that he was talking about the fact that I didn’t kiss him. It has been eating me up for days. Am I manipulating myself into believing that he intended for a third kiss? Doesn’t he like me? What do I do? Should I stop with this?

I’m very confused. He isn’t helpful either; how can a gay guy be this neutral? He hasn’t given me any clear signs. Maybe he doesn’t trust me because I’ve sort of talked behind my own back, revealing my silliness and my flings with women. In hindsight, I probably have ruined my chances of being liked by talking about the stupid things I’d do. The problem is, I’m totally not sure what I want; I can’t honestly feel sure myself what this is about. I don’t know if he wants anything from me. The only things I can cling to are the fact that he hasn’t kicked me in the nuts when I kissed him and that talk about eating three times!

He sent me a picture of him and his niece out of nowhere. We weren’t chatting or anything; he never did that—at least never with me. 

Is that a sign he’s leaving? I’m not sure. I’m thinking about him a lot these days. I can’t wait to see him this Friday, as he’s on vacation until Thursday. But I’m totally messed up and unable to make heads or tails of this. Imagine if he comes to work on Friday and goes straight to HR. 😨

It’s odd, though, that I’m always assuming he’s a bottom—I mean, I’d want him to be. I can see a long prospect here. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but I’ve been wondering for so long how to figure him out and how he feels. This isn’t just superficial stuff just to have an endgame, i think i really like him. 

I apologise for having taken so long, nobody to talk to about these things and I wanted to express everything i had so your advice on what to do would be based on as much context as I could give you!

Anyway, totally worth it.

Back here, this time hopefully i'll actually seperate things by chapter. Wonder how much i stick to that promise lol. I'll also now try to rate chapters one by one and see what i think

\[CH125\] 8/10

Not too much theorizing material this chapter, but it was cool. Shaun was able to make a connection in changes in Suzie's behavior after she spilled the coffee to realise that after coffee gradually fades away after certain events that trigger memories from their past lives. Not only it is useful information, but Shaun took the initiative and used it to get closer to her and try to help her battle coffee's effect.

In the end it isn't just time that helps against that. After the debutant class living dolls looked at the sky and talked, they kept remembering things one after one. One person remembering something helped others remember it better and teamwork made their memories come back in no time - so some kind of dialogue is obviously also important

I was a bit surprised by Suzanna taking John in but i guess his ""i just wanted you to smile"" has convinced her to let him in and then they were pretty much buddies. That's a good first step towards it, John made it risky af but the gamble overall paid off thankfully and Shaun did well as usual. Good first step on John's side of things

Not just that, but they also learned what happens to the shadows after drinking the regular coffee and that Benjamin is sort of an information storage (And that star bearers work together in finding and noting down everyones soot powers)

\[CH126\] 7.5/10

Pretty cool chapter, Louise saving John from trouble was pretty unexpected, but cool. She realised from their convo those people would just snitch every small thing to the relief team so she did something for John to not be seen.

Oliver managing things for some reason reminded me of the endless ""ask mom"" ""ask dad"" cycle, it's funny that oliver keeps the notes even though benjamin is the one that is told everything. Also , Louise most likely lied to him by saying she talked to Suzanna, even though it was John. Or if she didn't, Benjamin already knows they're kinda working together, but that is unlikely. Hopefully benjamin doesnt casually drop louise's ""convo"" with suzanna in a vanilla conversation which gets their teamwork exposed, but even then i feel like it wouldn't be that big of a deal

Louise got things done pretty quickly so she's now side questing in cheering Benjamin up even better lol, i guess Kate's turn will come next. I wonder how will patrick deal with Barbara, though, but not sure that's needed this much since Oliver is the one that has the info-book of sorts.

\[CH127\] 9.3/10

This chapter was really awesome! First of all, i like how Kate immediately assumed she knows about her soot power because she's Edward's underling which led her to answer honestly as to not lie to her face or seem unwilling to show her stuff. That'd take a toll on Belle aswell!

However, based on Sara's reaction after the rain, she didn't know about soot powers. That totally makes sense if you put that together with her reaction to the message ravens and Edward's opinion of her. That makes me think Kate was wrong about Sara knowing her soot power and that what she said in the garden wasn't a lie.

Kate overestimated what Edward thought of her which led her to believe he shared info on her soot powers, but that act led Sara to potentially rethinking herself and that she could've been wrong about Kate. That being said though.. Why go to Thomas? What? Is she going to report to him what Edward told her to do? It doesn't seem like Kate's actions here were something that went against shadows houses rules, other than ""protect her no matter what"" - unless she overheard what Louise told her, which is a possibility, but Kate raised no concern over that so that makes it sort of weird

Could Sara's opinion on Kate genuienly change soon? That's interesting. Still doesn't explain why she'd meet Thomas, can't think of much things other than tattling on Kate about what Louise told her which she probably didn't hear anyway.. , or the fact that she spied for Edward. Maybe it for once doesn't have to do something with Kate but i'm not gonna jump the gun

Her excuse to run off did sort of come off as ""give me some time to think, i don't like where this convo is going, i am not supposed to be protected by you"" but also not rlly.. idk how to explain it. It was pretty convinient too though, as if she was in a hurry to meet Thomas, and knew he'd be there.

Perhaps Thomas found out she spied for Edward? Maybe it has to do something with Douglas. He could've changed sides and started acting in Thomas's interest, especially given how quickly he acted with forming a disciplinary team. Kate also connected dots about Sara coming to her rather than Douglas, perhaps it's because they're no longer working together. Maybe Douglas already told Thomas everything including him and Sara spying. Perhaps she wants to do something about it to not get much behind Douglas in that matter.. i'll see

\[CH128\] 9/10

That was also awesome. I was somewhat right about her tattling to Thomas on Edwards plan. I was wrong that Douglas already changed sides, but he could've lied to Sara aswell, it's not impossible he's still working with Thomas, but i think so far i lean he remained Edward's pawn, though he prob built some kind of relations with Thomas aswell.

I also was right about Douglas somewhat not working together with Sara. He did tell her to not do anything and proclaimed her useless, she did make a mistake according to his plans aswell, but maybe it's just because he doesn't want her to also make contact with Thomas, or act further upon it

Sara then started getting into senses and was about to work together with Kate - but Mia has took that wish off her.. Pretty unfortunate, she almost got it. It was quite gruesome to see Mia give her the bat and just let her smack her for ""improvement"" of both of them :( now my hope for Sara is also (temporarily) gone and Mia's coffee still didn't quite run out. I wonder if Sara triggered her past like Shaun did with Suzie instead of panicking and accepting everything - surely things would've gone better. Now she just forgot Kate's kindness toward her and started being arrogant again.. God, Mia's face is just painful to look at.

\[CH129\] 9.4/10

This chapter was super cool too, i guess it means the build ups for this arc were over, or somewhat. Not as they were any bad though, just not as good as those 3 chapters.

They pretty much summarized everything that happened up from the gathering of roses up until now in the first slide which i thought was cool, helped a bit with the time frame aswell.

One thing i didn't realise that was pointed out on it is potentially Oliver will lead them to Barbara, which would make sense but also be a bit silly. Though, it isn't confirmed yet

Memorizing the routes of sacked dolls and using them as transport for Shirley was clever. The whole pen thing was funny, glad they found a work around it because otherwise it'd be... uh, silly.. The small backpack for notes is really cool aswell!

I guess there's no much theories for this and Thomas-Barbara convo told them about Lewis's existence and that Barbara is brainwashed by Thomas into believing Christopher is alive. They surely did figure out ALOT in those 2 days, that was a fun investigation to watch, now it's time for Kate to talk to Oliver.

That should be it for today, i should be able to read the next 4 tomorrow

\[CH130\] 9.1/10

Woah, Oliver's really smart. But that is pretty confusing... He was aware that living dolls are human, but said ""don't think unnecessary things??"" That's really weird... How can he know about that topics and still be brainwashed? Perhaps he's joking, pretending to be brainwashed or is willing to serve the Shadows House despite not being brainwashed

One other theory i had is that the machine actually reads their thoughts. Negative emotions and questions are a cover up = and that is how he was able to figure those 2 things out but still keep up with a brainwashed expression and response. That is, i feel like, the only way for those 2 to actually be brainwashed and still go on about things, i guess? I wonder how Kate will get out of this situation..

\[CH131\] 8.9/10

Okay, so... i guess Ollie was brainwashed?? I'm still not too sure about that, but it looks like they've figured most things themselves and Oliver wants to continue their research & serve Shadows house at all costs, even if it means to sacrifice Ollie.

How was Kate able to pull Emilico away?? That is sort of a question, tbh. Kate is locked so unless her soot was able to get out of the cage she wouldn't be able to control the soot there. Or she broke the cage with her soot and let Emilico escape

ORRR, if she emitted any soot before getting into the cage, she used that soot to pull Emi away, and she didn't break her cage. That also reveals physical objects won't stop her from controlling her soot located beyond it.

That was a really good ep too, although i don't feel like there's much more content to theorize about. Now that Emi escaped, we need her to rescue Kate and uh.. kidnap those 2 :3 or turn them on your side

\[CH132\] 9.3/10

Emilyko's way of uh.. dealing with things, is sort of cool, ngl. I guess Emilyko escaped herself before then, without Kate's help? I guess it was just Emi then.

The battle was pretty cool. Kate creating a clone with her cloth once her soot was able to escape thanks to Emi was dope. I didn't realise Oliver didn't know of her powers since she only demonstrated the wings. I guess Oliver wasn't able to see everything and how she used her soot to control the cart-boat in the debut, lol.

I guess research and curiosity has got to be the only factor driving Oliver forward then. He switched sides to quickly after hearing not even Kate knows about her past and how she's able to use soot powers.

\[CH133\] 8.7/10

How ironic, Oliver tricked Kate into the whole thing only for her to make an Ally of him later and then have her soot break his device to the point where his invention is nearly useless and they'd rather go with Kate's original plan. Atleast Oliver is allied to Kate now, though, hopefully that'll help them alot in the future

Those earplugs really are amazing, huh? But they did backfire, Jeremiah would love that kind of information being handed to him basically for free

So, Emilyko was supposed to meet Ricky but ran into Patrick instead. Bro panicked and fell, and then his soot turned into a heart?? Could it be that his soot power is finally awakening.. Or.. did that just expose his feeling towards Emi and that's it?? That'd be awkward LMAO. I want to see Emi's reaction on that so bad but i guess that'll be it for today, i did finish the volume sooo..",3,1767663074.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False

Me and my wife have ADHD and at least 2 out of 3 kids have it too 🤯  Our home life is.. interesting.  

I have created automatic routines for bed time, bath time, game time and leaving the house.  Embedded in the these are timers and loss of privileges if conditions aren’t met.  The house has to be ‘reset’ before leaving the house and before going to bed.  To do this I’ve made everything in the house have a place(mostly) - nothing sits on a bench or on the floor.  Everything has a container.  For the kids - a basket each.  If they want desert after dinner - reset.  If we leave the house - reset.  Now that the house is clean I can run our Robovac while we’re gone.  Anyone that has one understands that you have to have a clean house to even use one 😆  As soon as the routine starts, the power to the TV automatically turns off.  It’s not us bossing them around - it’s house rules.  They’ve earnt gaming privileges?  Set a 1 hour game routine which gives a 5min warning at the end, shuts the TV down automatically - house rules. 

This forces us to be accountable, we have to do our own reset within the time frame.  Dinner needs to be ready, bins, dishes, blinds etc complete before bed.  There’s stakes and there’s a deadline which helps us scattered folk get shit done.

I wonder how effective these automated routines could be for people without kids?  Could you set yourself a system of privilege loss?  Now ironically the hardest part about this is setting the system up.  Do what you gotta do to get you there, score some m$th,drink 5 coffees, whatever you have to do!  Highly recommend giving it a go.  ",1,1767662997.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

How do you handle high-pressure trade-offs?,"Hi everyone. I’m 6 months into my first PM role at a Big Tech company, and I’m struggling. I’m currently in a high-pressure monetization org where the stakes feel incredibly high every single day.

I used to think I was great with ambiguity. It’s why I wanted to be a PM, but the reality of making quick decisions and complex trade-offs is hitting hard. I find myself second-guessing every choice, paralyzed by the fear of not hitting revenue goals or making a call that I can't justify with 100% certainty

I feel like I'm constantly underwater, and the imposter syndrome is becoming a permanent state of mind.

I would love to hear from other women PMs (especially those in monetization or high-growth areas):

1. Decision-making: How do you get comfortable making fast trade-offs when you don't have perfect data? Are there frameworks you use to stop the spiral of overthinking?
2. Resources: Are there specific books, blogs, or courses that helped you ""click"" with the strategic side of PMing in your first year?
3. Mentorship: How did you find a mentor in product? (If anyone here is open to a virtual coffee/chat, I would be so grateful).

I really want to succeed here, but right now I just feel like I’m failing. Any advice or even just ""I've been there"" would mean a lot.",6,1767662941.0,womenintech,2,0.88,False

I know 2 people who work at big 5s. I’m going to ask them if they could hook me up to have a coffee chat with colleagues of theirs who work closer to what I’d like to pursue (a career in marketing). I know it’s not guaranteed at all (I get it’s not normal to just hand out an opportunity to someone you just met) that they’d consider me for a role and that there’d be a role open by the time I chat with them but would it hypothetically affect my chances if the hiring manager or recruiter were to see that I applied to a business analyst internship at the same time? I have an interest in both role types but prefer marketing and I’m just trying to see what sticks. They seem to be in different sectors of the company though. 

Thoughts? Would it be offputting to the hiring manager or recruiting manager? Would they be able to see that I applied for the other role and the documents for it like what I wrote in my cover letter for one?",0,1767662750.0,FilmIndustryLA,1,0.33,False

i'd like to find all the data about my daily coffee usage in one place and then see the data in a visualizer, almost like a whoop or fitness tracking recap.
