There are also certain plants I have I always sought out the smell of such as sweet olive (is this osmanthus in perfumery?), sweet almond (the bush/tree), magnolia, and gardenia. I have also always been a big tea lover, in particular bitter matcha, bitter and/or spicy chai, yerba mate, sencha, and lavender/black tea combos. I've always loved woody smells such as pine, fir, and cedar. I just never thought to seek these out in perfume because I associated it with the department store perfume counter headaches of my childhood. Thank goodness I've finally discovered fragrance! This is a summary of where I'm at a couple months into my experience.



**Smells I know I like:** Incense/Frankincense (tend to prefer cold or minimal smoke to smoky or burning, at least for wearing), Camphor, Dragon's Blood, Eucalyptus, Lavender, Pine, Cedar, Dry wood, Tea (Black, green, yerba mate), Rice, Lilac, Rose, Cumin, Coriander, Caraway, Cardamom, Tonka Bean, Labdanum, Gardenia, Magnolia

**Smells I‚Äôm learning I like (on my skin) :** Cranberry, Tobacco (when not overpowering), Moss, Clean laundry, Fig, Patchouli, Hay, Pepper

**Smells I thought I‚Äôd like (on my skin) but now am not so sure:** Petrichor, Wet earth, Coffee, Grass (highly dependent on formulation)

**Smells I am interested to try/more of in perfumery:** Cacao, Chocolate, Vanilla, Sandalwood (highly dependent on ingredients), Carnation, Osmanthus, Caramel, Peony, Silk, Chestnut, Ice, snow, or cold air accords, Stone, Guava, Lime, Tomato leaf & stalk.

**Potential full bottles (I am ordering 5 ml decant to continue sampling before making a decision):**

Ichnusa, Profumum Roma

Photorealistic, BRIGHT, energizing FIG. Fig tree, fig leaf, grass, hay, myrtle. Not too sweet, not too dry. Happiness in a bottle. A Mediterranean vacation with your best friends. Laying in the grass under fig trees. A bright blue, almost cloudless sky. Dry, cold white wine. Then a bath with fig soap, a leisurely nap. You wake up to your skin still faintly smelling like the fig soap, the most perfect scent you can imagine as you head to dinner with your friends on a terrace overlooking the salty ocean. Later you fall asleep, windows open overlooking the sea, in complete contentment, the last wisps of almost imperceptible, soapy fig in your nose. I can't stop thinking about this one. Official notes: chopped grass, fig leaf, myrtle.  


Passage d‚ÄôEnfer, L‚ÄôArtisan Parfumeur

Light, airy, otherworldly, blissful, unlit incense. I used my entire sample in a couple hours so I need to get a decant for further investigation. Official notes: Lily, incense. 



Sumo Wrestler, J-Scent

Camphorous, meditative, ""masculine"" scent with a Japanese barbershop vibe. Bracing in the opening but calms down quickly on the skin. It remains uplifting & bright without being overpowering. A scent profile I didn't know I needed in my life. J-Scent created this perfume to smell like bintsuke, the hair oil that sumo wrestlers use. Official notes: Orange, eucalyptus, anise, cinnamon, heliotrope, violet, orange flower, labdanum, sandalwood, patchouli, jasmine. 



La Fille de Berlin, Serge Lutens

Deep, dark ROSE, moss, metallic note that is almost bloody. This made me realize I like to smell like moss. This perfume is vampiric but like a 28 year old woman who was turned into a vampire 10 years ago. She's new to vampire life but has embraced lush fabrics & seducing beautiful, ambiguously gendered humans for her meals. She will feed you tea & Turkish delight on her red velvet couch in front of a roaring fire, her vintage turntable playing Beethoven, before turning you into a vampire to spend all eternity living in her rose scented world. Official notes: rose, pepper.



**5 ml decants I own:**

En Passant, Frederic Malle

I get lilac, almost transparent white musk, possibly some cucumber or just wateriness. Photorealistic lilac that also feels like a watercolor of a lilac tree. Feels relaxed yet precious. Ageless. A perfect spring perfume. Official notes are white lilac accord, petitgrain, cucumber, wheat absolute, white musk, cedar. 

El Dorado, Scout Dixon West

I get FOREST, bracing, dark GREEN, lush, beautiful, resinous forest after a light rain. Instant love. For me this is photorealistic with nothing ""perfumy"". This has been a bedtime scent for me. It is apparently supposed to smell like a redwood forest. Official notes: juniper, lemon balm, petrichor, rosemary, cypress, labdanum flower, guaiac, vetiver, fir. 



**Full bottles I own:**

L‚ÄôOrpheline, Serge Lutens

I fell in love with this just smelling the residue on the outside of the tiny 1 ml. sample vial, and then the residue on my fingers when I opened it. This is blurry, fuzzy, cold yet warm incense. Vintage but modern. Feels like opening an old, dry wooden box full of vintage, dried out beauty products and inhaling deeply. Aldehydic. Dusty but not musty. Churchy but cozy, in a slightly lonely, melancholy way. A content vampire. Heavenly dry down. Official notes: Incense, dry wood, pepper.

From my stream of consciousness notes:

Dry down is like fairy dust. It's like the surface of my skin has been changed on a molecular level, as if my skin has become incredibly smooth. I keep inhaling so deeply because the powdery-ness & musk are so enjoyable. The fuzzy, (patchouli?) floral musk kind of feels like a void. I can't discern individual notes which makes me want to smell it over and over again. It's not trying to put me in any mood. It's a bit melancholy & meditative, even uplifting, but not pushy about it. 



L‚ÄôEau Trois, Diptyque (This is discontinued. One of the Las Vegas boutiques emailed me about having this in stock after I put in a request on the Diptyque website) I bought this one without sampling first and luckily it smells wonderful. I don't like it on my skin because it gets very myrrh dominant and sweet but it's a new, previously unopened bottle so I am giving it some time to interact with the air before trying again. Even if I am never able to wear this, I am happy just to be able to smell it when the mood strikes because it is divine. Official notes: myrrh, rockrose, incense, rosemary.



**Minis I own:**

Frederic Malle ‚Äúloved by women‚Äù minis (En Passant, Portrait of a Lady, Eu de Magnolia, Musc Ravageur, Carnal Flower)

Recently diagnosed with gMG.  About two years ago, when this started, the first symptoms that accompanied double vision are things no one has been able to explain.  Wondering if anyone else here has experienced.

I've noticed that, as I'm about to experience an acute flare of generalized symptoms, the red flags appear to be:

1. Swelling on one side of face & neck
2. Pulsatile tinnitus on the same side (not ringing... roaring/whooshing)
3. Sinuses feel like they close up (no allergies or drainage).  Much worse on side with the swelling. Goes away entirely during steroid blast.
4. Sensation of ""buzzing"" or vibrations especially on face, scalp and torso. Kind of like the feeling of touching a metal table with a very low energy electrical current running through it.  Not shocking or painful, just unpleasant buzziness.
5. Altered sensation of taste and feeling of burning in mouth (like I drank some scalding hot coffee and burned my mouth, but it just won't get better or go away).

All the docs tell me none of this makes sense with MG.  Anyone else experience similar combinations at all?

1gf6pil,https://www.reddit.com/r/GREEK/comments/1gf6pil/how_long_can_i_realistically_progress_in_6_months/,How long can I realistically progress in 6 months? A year?,"**Background:**

33 yrs old.

I spent most of my life studying Spanish, but without great consistency. While I took it every year in school, it was only 3 days/week, and then summers I had a tutor maybe a few times a week also.

Later I lived in Spanish speaking, but never longer than 3 months-1yr.

By the age 27, I was in b2/c1 classes while living in Spain. Again I took them a few days/week.  But, it really was hard for my brain to grasp despite studying the language for so many years. I am not sure if this is just means I am not great at languages.

**Present day:**

I now have been living in Greece for 1 year and 2 months with my fiance who is Greek-American (we speak in English).

My biggest exposure to the language is through his family here. We primarily communicates with them in Greek. But, we don't see them every day, so most of daily practice is through casual interactions in town. For some reason, everyone, and I mean *everyone* thinks that I am greek (great for learning). For the first 6 months of living here I got an endless slew of ""Oh I thought you were Greek!"" from strangers when I replied in English.

**Studying:**

I took a level 1 Greek course that was 3 days/week, 9 hours total last spring. It helped a ton, but it wasn't enough to do more than order coffee and ask my in-law 7 yr old niece if she likes the ocean, or the food, or color blue.

I decided to re-take level 1, and it really has helped solidify the basics. This time I am taking a month long, 5 day/week (15hrs/week total) class, which is making the language stick a lot better. The daily consistency helps a ton.

I've also completely fallen in love with the idea that I might be able to speak this language one day, and I am feeling really impatient to learn more.

I want to continue taking my daily courses. I plan to keep taking 15hrs/week of Greek class for as long as I can possibly afford to with work (and sanity, lol).

**Question:**

What level can I theoretically get to by taking my 5 day/week Greek class for the next 6 months? Or the next year? If I am at an A1 or A2 level now, is it possible I could get to a b2 level by Spring if I stuck with my 5day/week (15hr total) class?

I know the school I go to offers it consistently every month until the summer months.

I guess I've never really mastered a language and I am wondering how long that really takes? Basically, I assume that anyone can study a language for a year, or 2 years, but that the brain might reach some kind of capacity of absorption. I am wondering if some of learning a language straight up requires time.

Further pondering on language learning.. I know the it is possible to master a language as an adult. I know that it takes in theory, something like 1100 hrs. How real is this? 

For example, I know someone who went from knowing no German, to getting her PhD in German. She said it took her about 5 years of studying German to really become profiencent, and a total of 8 years of living in Austria and studying to get to PhD level of writing and speaking. 

I have also taught English as a second language, and kept in touch with some of my students. One student in particular began her journey knowing nothing, and when I reconnected with over the years we had some basic conversations over text. When I met up with her again in year 5 of her studying, she had skyrocketed into having full blown, easy flowing conversations. But she had also moved from her Spanish speaking country, to an English speaking country for a year or so in-between year 3 and 5 of her studies.",1,1730239073.0,GREEK,0,1.0,False

1gf6ftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_eggnog17/comments/1gf6ftw/i_wish_you_peace/,I Wish You Peace,"So there was this guy who used to work with me at a local deli. We knew each other somewhat but we were really just acquaintances. Then one day he came up to me and another colleague of mine and said he wanted to be friends with us, and that he wanted to hang out sometime. I and the other coworker agreed and we made plans to meet each other.

Well we met. We had some fun. He made some comments that were innocuous but still rather worrying but we left on a good note. He did some things he shouldn't have done. Said some stuff. He did some cocaine. Smoked inside my house. Tried to justify all those stupid and shitty things. That stuff bleeds over into work. The bosses take notice and write him up. Eventually they get tired of him and his crap and fire him.

I invited him to my birthday during all of this. As that day gets near I worry about what will happen if he does come. My birthday arrives, he is a no-show, and I have a good time and forget about him. He texts me the next day apologizing for not showing up. I tell him it's alright; that I wish him the best of luck. And that's it. That's all there is to it. That is how I gained and lost my friend. What more do you want from me? What more is there to tell?¬†

**‚Ä¶**

His name was Jack. He was two years my junior and he was working at that deli well before I ever did. He was skinny, a little taller than me too. When he came into work he had this bleached asphalt colored beanie on due to the work policy, and under which he hid a mess of coal black curly hair. The only dreadlock on his head framed the left side of his face. He always seemed to wear a dark green shirt whenever I saw him.

At the time we really were just acquaintances. We talked about how our days were, how we were currently feeling,, how life was going. He told me then that though he was eighteen he was already planning on moving out- well, no, really he was being made to move out of his parent's house- and was looking for a place to stay. He would make mentions to his friends on Discord and how things were going with them. Occasionally he would pull me to the side and in a half whisper tell me that he was high on weed. Other coworkers would sometimes casually say in passing that he was lazy, deadweight if you will. I never saw what they were talking about though. Maybe that's because I wasn't paying attention. He was also friends with that colleague I mentioned, someone named Samuel who I was also associated with.

Well, as the days and weeks went by we began to build a rapport with each other, going a little more and more beyond the usual small talk every time we met. Then one day, out of the blue, he came up and asked if I wanted to be friends with him.¬† He told me that he fell out with his friends on Discord, and apparently they were the only ones he had, because he told me that now that he and them didn't see eye to eye he was looking for new people to hangout with. I was friendless myself at the time. A condition which could be summarized as my personal struggle against mental health and life's pressures. I was looking to fight against it, the years of isolation and anxiety and hatred that had until recently defined me. How could I have turned down his offer? I said yes.

He and Samuel had already hung out with each other at least once. Turns out all three of us had an affinity for antique shops, and I knew of three all crammed into an otherwise abandoned brick warehouse, or maybe it was a factory, situated right at the heart of our city's downtown. We made plans to meet each other at those shops two weeks out from then.

Samuel was technically the first to reach those shops. I ended up coming in around thirty minutes too early and tried to occupy that time with getting a gyro which ended up making me late. Jack was going to be late too due to him touring a rental property. In the meantime Samuel and I checked out the shops and chatted. We talked about my brother, how he was fairing and my concerns about him smoking and drinking even though he was only eighteen. We talked about college, how at the age of twenty eight Samuel was going to get his degree in psychology, and his interest in Freud. We compared our living situations, comparing how I was living with my parents and he was living in his own apartment. I already knew that Samuel and I were at least very similar in our temperaments. My coworkers had called me by his name a couple times by now. Conversing with him made me feel like I could let my guard down, cast aside the walls and bastions made by my anxiety and anger and just‚Ä¶ talk.

And then Jack called. He told us that he was outside looking for us, so we went out and met him there. On that strip of asphalt called a parking lot, he sauntered up to us in that dark green shirt, and an odd fire was lit in my head. I wish I could say that I had a good time with them, and honestly I did. We spent a solid hour ogling the baubles and trinkets each shop jammed into every available space as permitted by those cavernous brick-walled rooms, and afterwards we got coffee and tea from some bougie coffee shop called the Insipid End. We walked then, under a heaven blue sky, to a pizza place called Big EE's which was situated in the center of downtown in a skyscraper's basement. There you could get pizza by the slice for three dollars and watch old Garfield cartoons on the dingy wooden walls. I had a good time, a great time even, but throughout the entire thing I felt a sense of dread and agitation I couldn‚Äôt explain. There was something there poisoning the whole experience.

Maybe it was how Jack just kinda knew things. He would correct us on what we were looking at in the antiques shops. Talk about what the current state laws were. Tell us about the Cuban who used to own the pizza shop and sold it for a tidy sum, all with the eased confidence of a salesman. Little things that made you think ‚Äúhow does he know that?‚Äù Or maybe it wasn't just that. On our way to Big EE's he began to talk about his former friends, and how bad losing them was, and how lonely he had been before he met us. I asked him why he fell out with them. That was my first regret. I saw the pain on his face and I wanted to so badly take back my question. He paused for a minute.

‚ÄúMy friends accused me of something and didn't give me a chance to defend myself. They just assumed I did this terrible thing and kicked me out from the Discord server.‚Äù

Looking back, it was obvious that he was being vague. At the time I thought that it was because recalling why he lost them was still too fresh of a wound. Maybe it was, but‚Ä¶ even now, I could have sworn that for a brief moment the sky was a stagnant green.

Our cars were in the parking lot next to the coffee shop so we had to walk back. We still talked but the pauses in between were getting longer and more frequent. We were worn. It had been a long day and the longer I spent around Jack the more irritable I became until by the end I had tired myself out. I never figured out why I was bothered by him then. When we got back Jack said ‚ÄúHey, I really needed this,‚Äù and we hugged then and there. Before we got into our cars I invited him to my birthday party. The sky was heaven blue.

Jack's faults became more apparent the more we worked with each other. It was nearing the end of June and July was going to start up next week, and by then he had been moved to work with the morning crew. Samuel still seemed to like Jack and didn‚Äôt really seem to mind him. Still, little things were getting hard to ignore. For example there was this girl, Jane. She got in an argument with Jack over something. I don't remember what it was about. All I knew was that Jack was in the wrong. Jane pulled me aside and whispered ‚ÄúJack is such an asshole,‚Äù which left me a bit baffled. I figured at that point that Jack had his problems but he couldn't be that bad. I asked him what was going on, and he said ‚ÄúLook, if she wants to fight me, I'll fight her right back.‚Äú¬†

A week later from this he pulled me aside and he told me he bought a gram of cocaine, off of Gene, another coworker of ours.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you thinking?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's Alright I already got addicted to these before and I beat it. I can't get addicted to it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not how it works. You know this. You shouldn't be doing it. You're going to get in trouble‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, look. That is how it works. If I get addicted and then beat it I can't get addicted again. I can just get rid of this stuff if I don't like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, look, buddy, that‚Äôs not how it works. Look, why are you even telling me‚Äú

‚ÄúBecause I know you won't tell the bosses.‚Äù His words sat like a pebble in my shoe for the rest of my shift. It bothered me but I didn't know what to do about it. He was right. I never did tell them.

Later that evening when I was home He texted me saying that the cocaine was ass. He tried a line and then put the rest in the bag. Again I told him that I didn't care if he thought if he could handle it or not, that stuff could only spell trouble for him. His reply was this weird, disjointed, ramble about how he tried it and didn't like it and didn't even want it anymore. All I could say was ‚ÄúI stand by my words.‚Äù

Somewhere, sometime either before or after that incident I invited him to my house. He was planning on showing me his vinyl records and was going to bring his vr headset, and I planned on playing Battlefield with him on the Xbox. He came in that evening wearing that green shirt of his. We went down into my basement, sat down and listened to some of his records. Jazz, old school rock, stuff that came from the 70's, 80's, 90's. I got to try out his VR headset and played a game called Pavlov. After twenty minutes I got so sick I had to take it off and just sit on the couch.¬†

I learned he had a gundam collection, or, well, at least he was into it. He said he didn‚Äôt really have the money for it. When I suggested that he try making his own from boxes and paint he bristled at the idea and said he didn‚Äôt even have the money for that. His search for a living space wasn‚Äôt going so well either. He didn‚Äôt really like the apartments he toured, as they were either out of his price range or lacked some amenities. He had a friend who told him that he could move into their place when they moved out, but they were taking a while. When I told him about my progress with my exercises he said he also used to work out.¬†

‚ÄúI could deadlift 300 pounds as a set,‚Äú he gloated. ‚ÄùI had to stop because it got to the point where my back was constantly flexing. My family had to take me to the doctors and everything.‚Äú I believed him even when I shouldn't have.¬†

When we were listening to his records again, he started to vape. I was taken aback by it. Generally speaking I would have expected him to have asked if it was ok to do it, or to go and do it outside. I didn't really know what to say. I didn't really want to say anything because I was anxious. How was he going to respond? Everything up to that point indicated that he would have responded poorly. Still though...

‚ÄúHey, please don't smoke in my house.‚Äù

He stood up and stared me down. ‚ÄúWell, I'm not puffing the smoke out so it should be alright,‚Äù And then he hit the vape again.

I should have punched him. I wish I did, and I regret that I didn't. I was scared though. Didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Was afraid of what would happen if I pushed the issue, so for the rest of the evening we just sat on the couch in the basement and played the campaign for BattleField, with Jack hitting his vape every ten minutes. The house was green when he left..

I talked to my mom when Jack left. It felt like things were going to get out of hand if I didn't do something, so I told her everything. She wasn‚Äôt happy about it.¬†

‚ÄúYou know full well that I don‚Äôt want people smoking in my house. He clearly doesn‚Äôt seem to have any respect for your boundaries. Do you really want to hang out with someone like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know, I think I‚Äôm going to confront him tomorrow and see how that goes, but, I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt want to fight him but I don‚Äôt think I got a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Do you actually think He is going to fight you? You don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I think I got to. I don‚Äôt think I got a choice. It's just that I‚Äôm just afraid that we might actually physically fight‚Äù

‚Äú*Really?‚Äù*

‚ÄúWell, I mean, He did tell me that used to deadlift 300 pounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, you really think that? I could take him in a fight. He looks like a twig.‚Äù¬†

The next day when I came into work I asked him to come into the back of the deli‚Äôs freezer where¬† I confronted him. My nerves were frayed as I did my best to look Jack in the eye. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want him smoking in my house. That my parents didn‚Äôt want him smoking in my house, and that if couldn‚Äôt abide by that then he could no longer come over. All he said was ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù¬†

At work it felt like Jack had something akin to a deathwish. He was hiding out in the bathroom near the deli station for 20 minute breaks and would brag about these breaks adding up to an hour and a half. Whenever it was thirty minutes before his shift ended he would bail because as far as he was concerned the bosses had left a few hours earlier so there was no one to stop him. But the bosses were taking notice, and they were slowly starting to get fed up with him. One day in the middle of my shift, the head manager of the deli was leading Jack back to the office. She finally caught him hanging out in the bathroom. He looked like a sleazy penitent only seeking forgiveness because he was caught. When we got back we had our last conversation.¬†

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to try and move over to the tavern,‚Äù Jack said.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey pay more over there than here in the deli.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to stay here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, They don‚Äôt respect me here. They told me that they don‚Äôt respect me and that I‚Äôm worthless right to my face.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you think you can even move over there?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember his answer to my question. I don‚Äôt even think I thought to ask him that. All I remember is that for the rest of my shift I felt conflicted. On the one hand, how could you tell someone they‚Äôre worthless? At the same time, it was hard to not feel like Jack brought this on himself.

When I came in the next day I overheard one of my coworkers talking to the boss about someone. The bits and pieces from their conversation indicated that said person was let go. As far as the coworker was concerned the person had it coming, and as far as where the boss stood, they were just frustrated that it came to this after all the chances they gave this person. Something odd sat in my stomach. Jack wasn‚Äôt there, and I knew that he was supposed to be because everyone‚Äôs shift schedule was posted on a board in the backroom. I approached Samuel and asked. ‚ÄúHey where‚Äôs Jack?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you hear, Jack was fired‚Äù

**‚Ä¶**

It was saintly, that red and yellow evening sky on my birthday. I had turned twenty one and was a little boozy. I was afraid that Jack would come over. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to take my invite back, but I knew that if he did come the chances of there being some incident with him were at least non zero if not a guarantee. I spent every day worrying. The mere thought clawing at the back of my head like a bad itch. My mom said not to worry about it. That she and my brother would be able to handle it if he did get out of hand and tried to start something. Whether you come out on top or not though, an incident is an incident, and honestly I just wanted to have a good time. I wasn't ready to face him. I didn‚Äôt want to face him. It occurred to me well after he was fired that whatever sort of friendship we had wasn‚Äôt going to work out, and that at best he was someone I wanted to keep at arm's length away from me. If he was going to come then fine but after that I didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with him.¬†

And then my birthday came. In the heady mix of family, and with Samuel being there, I just about, for that moment, forgot about him. Jack was a no-show. I didn‚Äôt even get a text from him saying that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. Not that it mattered at that point. By the time Samuel left I was through a glass of scotch and I wanted to go to the Insipid End to finish the night off. Understandably my brother fought me and convinced me that he should drive me there.¬†¬†

On the highway to the coffee shop, under the reds, yellows, and blues painting the world above, I opened up to my brother about Jack.

‚ÄúWhat do you think Jack was doing in the bathroom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know. I never really met him so I can‚Äôt really tell you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, he told me a lot of things. Like how he used to be able to rep 300 pounds for deadlifts. He also said that he wasn‚Äôt addicted to anything even though he did a line of coke, and he did vape in our house when you were gone. Honestly I‚Äôm just wondering if everything he told me was just a lie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no, listen. What I like to do is take anything anyone tells me and put it on a spectrum with truth on one end and lies on the other. And by the sound of things, he is a complete bullshitter.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I think your-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, wait! No, I know what he was doing!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúJack, he was hitting his vape in the bathroom.‚Äù

**‚Ä¶**

The last time I interacted with Jack was the next day over text. He was sorry that he couldn‚Äôt come to my party. I said that it was okay and asked how he was doing. He said he wasn‚Äôt doing well and that he was trying to take things a day at a time, and to that I wished him good luck. The last thing he said to me was simply ‚ÄúThanks man.‚Äù

I look back on my brief friendship with Jack and I see all the things I wish I did differently. I wish I was more forceful with him about the cocaine, or that I kicked him out the moment he got up and stared me down in my own home over a vape. I still think about my birthday party, and what would have happened if Jack did show up. If there really would have been some sort of incident that tainted the mood of the whole event. What I regret most, however, is that I never formally told him that I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with him anymore.

I have a mini-fridge full of hot sauces including many super-hots and don't have a problem with any of them. I eat orange habaneros from the grocery store raw with no problem. I grew some Reapers last year and wasn't brave enough to try more than a nibble. It was wicked hot but bearable. The rest of them i dehydrated and turned into crushed pepper which I occasionally use a tiny dash to spice things way up. Suffice to say, i'm not chowing down super-hot pods but I can tolerate a good amount of heat.

 This summer I grew some Red Habaneros in the garden and harvested a handful last night and just put them away with the rest of my peppers. I'm making chili later this week. Sometimes i wake up and start my day with a mouthful of something spicy just for kicks. A couple pickled jalapenos or a drop of hotsauce on a spoon will wake me up better than a cup of coffee. This morning i popped one of those red habaneros in my mouth. It was hotter than i expected and i felt it deep in the back of my throat which is an unusual sensation for me. It actually kinda felt like i might have damaged my throat for a few minutes but after a swig of milk and chewing on a cup of ice, i was fine. i went about my morning and after about 15 minutes i was back to baseline and almost forgot about the whole thing. 

about an hour later i felt a sharp, intense, searing hole in my gut and ran for the bathroom. it wasn't pretty... i was spraying out both ends, drenched in sweat, and on the verge of hallucinating. my wife came home from her swim and found me lying naked on the tile floor in a pool of sweat. the whole thing lasted maybe 15 minutes then i got up and took a shower and felt like nothing had happened.

i'm not sure what the deal is with these habaneros but i am now terrified of them... one pod literally put me on my ass and i feel like a total pussy...",5,1730238331.0,spicy,2,1.0,False

I just start having a very fast heartbeat around 220-240 bpm. I am not telling too much I went on a bpm tap finder website and tapped with the speed/heartbeat i remembered. Also that moment I start feeling lightheaded (seeing darker) and feeling the heart bump in my torso. I feel the pow pow pow in my torso idk how to explain it. This lasts for about half a minute then I try to take a deep breath and suddenly stops and goes back to normal.

Alright, here goes‚Äîprobably the weirdest ‚Äúromantic‚Äù experience of my life. It started in January 2022. I‚Äôm 23, male, working in tech, and hitting the gym every evening with my usual crew. One day, my training partner‚Äîa female bodybuilder‚Äîpoints out that this Korean girl, slim and usually training alone, keeps glancing over at me. I‚Äôm more of an introvert, so I just give a shy smile and leave it at that.

Over the next few weeks, things get interesting. She starts training near me, and we exchange those shy gym smiles. My buddies egg me on to talk to her, so eventually, I do. Turns out she‚Äôs 19, studying Pharmacy, and an ENFJ. We bond over East Asian culture (I lived in Asia for a bit‚Äîpretty rare for someone my age). She takes my number, agrees to train together, and I think, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs see where this goes.‚Äù

The Hot-and-Cold Game Begins

We set up a gym session together, and it goes well. But the day after? Her texts suddenly go cold. By mid-week, I see her at the gym, give a polite smile, and decide it‚Äôs best to back off.

Then, Friday rolls around. I‚Äôm at a coffee shop when I see her with a friend, and they start walking towards me. A few minutes later, she taps me on the shoulder, all smiles, and introduces her friend. We end up chatting for hours, then grabbing Vietnamese food. I cover the bill, and they both seem genuinely thankful, even insisting on ‚Äúmaking it up to me.‚Äù

The next day, we hang out again‚ÄîItalian food, coffee, and a walk in the park. There‚Äôs a vibe. That night, we hit a bar, drinks are flowing, and they even join me at a uni house party. But by Sunday? Her messages are radio-silent again. By Monday, she‚Äôs back with a short text saying she‚Äôs busy with exams. I‚Äôm older, working full-time, and it‚Äôs starting to feel like I‚Äôm on an emotional rollercoaster.

The Plot Twist

Then, three days later on Thursday, I‚Äôm leaving the gym, headed to Starbucks, and there she is‚Äîwalking hand-in-hand with her boyfriend. She just casually waves and says ‚Äúhi‚Äù like nothing happened. Suddenly, everything clicks. I feel like an idiot for not even asking if she was single.

My thinking is simple: When you‚Äôre not sure what to do, think about what you shouldn‚Äôt do. So, I decide to move on. I‚Äôm 6ft+, in good shape, have a good job‚Äîlife will be fine without her.

But then, a few days later, I get a message from my Polish bodybuilder friend, who tells me she‚Äôs seen the Korean girl signing up at a different gym nearby. Turns out she‚Äôs blocked me from seeing her boyfriend‚Äôs posts on Instagram, hiding their relationship. At this point, it‚Äôs starting to feel‚Ä¶calculated.

November 2022: New Instagram Mystery

By November, I‚Äôm fully moving on. Then, out of nowhere, I get a follow request from an account I don‚Äôt recognize. Turns out, it‚Äôs this Eastern European girl from the gym who I‚Äôd barely spoken to but knew by sight. She‚Äôs always in the background, mostly just walking on the treadmill. I find it odd, but figure she found my account through gym connections. Little did I know, this wouldn‚Äôt be the last odd encounter with her.

An Unexpected Return

Fast forward to August 2024. Life‚Äôs moved on. I‚Äôm in a great relationship, focusing on work and training, even winning some national awards for charity work. I‚Äôve barely thought about the gym girl in over a year. But then, on my lunch break, I see her again. She‚Äôs back at the gym, glancing over, walking out at the same time, striking up small talk. My guard‚Äôs up this time; I‚Äôm polite but distant.

Then one Friday night, I‚Äôm at Starbucks reading, and the Eastern European girl from the gym‚Äîthe one who followed me on Instagram‚Äîcomes up to say hi. She mentions she‚Äôs grabbing drinks with her ‚Äúfriend from Korea.‚Äù I never gave it much thought because they were 2 completely different people studying 2 completely different courses and 2 completely different universities. That night, they post an Instagram story together, and it hits me: the Korean girl‚Äôs probably using her friend to act as a friend and pose as a spy. Part of me thinks, ‚ÄúThis cannot be real life.‚Äù 

I know how intimidating and straight talking I can be when confronting others, and trust me, I am well aware of how they can play the victim.

The Last Straw

A few weeks later, I post a photo with my current girlfriend. Days later, the Korean girl approaches me in the gym, asking how my weekend went. I keep it vague, but she quickly mentions she‚Äôs seeing her boyfriend this weekend too, almost as if she‚Äôs trying to provoke a reaction. At this point, I‚Äôm done trying to figure her out. Is she craving attention? Keeping tabs? Playing some weird game? I‚Äôm honestly baffled.

I‚Äôll probably never know what her deal is, but one thing‚Äôs for sure: I‚Äôm not going down that rabbit hole again. I‚Äôm happy, focused, and don‚Äôt need the drama. I even deleted all my social media‚Äôs too.

Home is located downtown about 2.5 miles from the stadium in the desirable Herron Morton neighborhood, north of the circle. The accommodation would be the 3rd floor large attic-style bedroom with queen bed and optional queen-size air mattress. Air mattress could also be put in the home office bedroom on 2nd floor if two bedrooms are preferred. TV in 3rd floor room. Private bathroom on 2nd floor. Homeowner‚Äôs bedroom / bath is on the 2nd floor and the first floor is open shared space. Free street parking available if needed. 

She will be around all weekend in her home or running errands as usual but will try to give you your space. Small hypoallergenic dog will also be home. Walkable to a coffee shop and restaurants in the neighborhood. 

Available Friday, Saturday, or Sunday nights. Max 4 people. Additional services can be added: ride to/from the concert, ride to/from airport. 

Make an offer for what you think is reasonable - she would like to be paid but also isn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúmake money‚Äù. RT Rides for concert or airport would be $50 extra, each.

I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I‚Äôm just trying to navigate the world as best I can like everyone else. My sister always said I‚Äôm more gullible than I should be at my age - very suggestible is a nicer way to put it I think. My beliefs and convictions are like loose flower petals on a gusty day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I‚Äôm floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I‚Äôm floating west. One day, I‚Äôll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it‚Äôs a hoax. I know, it‚Äôs pathetic. I swear to God I‚Äôll change if I can make it through this year, but I‚Äôve exhausted my savings, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off.

It all started a few weeks ago. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I‚Äôve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn‚Äôt born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn‚Äôt find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I was never able to grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like ‚ÄúMuscle Matrix‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrazy Muscle‚Äù. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage. Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.

Terrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. Nothing I was recommended online seemed to have the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy in comparison to other guys my age. I could feel myself starting to give up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship in general. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker.¬†

Even though the advertisement didn‚Äôt even mention what it would fix about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù, ‚Äútechnology‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended anyway? And for that matter, why can‚Äôt I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ‚Äôs sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more ‚Äúof the earth‚Äù and ""organic"", the so-called ‚Äúnatural attraction technology‚Äù. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company.¬†

Like I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.

In my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before?¬†

This was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:

*Greetings Zach,*

*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.*¬†

*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.*¬†

*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this one-time cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra essentially teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short - one pill is all you need.*¬†

*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a one-time payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.*¬†

*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.*¬†

*Amy,*

I had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping over the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. It wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt afford the payment - I could, but barely, utilizing a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it certainly was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn‚Äôt the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn‚Äôt that illegal?¬†

To speed things up, I‚Äôll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down. Initially, I had some regrets about the purchase. But with it now in my system, that regret morphed into excitement.

I was ready not to be alone anymore.¬†

No big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, seemingly out of the blue. My muscles even began to look more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. I finally felt confident and like I was worthy of affection. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised about the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.

At first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It‚Äôs what drew me towards her in the first place. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn‚Äôt as fearful of rejection anymore. As the date progressed, I was shocked to find out that Stacy had also been stockpiling the courage to ask me on a date:

*‚ÄúOver the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.‚Äù* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn‚Äôt want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra.¬†

She giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection. I think she was under the impression that the part about the skin regimen was a playful joke. Then she said something that made my head spin:

*‚ÄúNo, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always respectful and polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôd say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense.‚Äù* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession. ¬†

Her words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you‚Äôre radiant. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.‚Äù*

The expression on her face changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually did manage to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something abruptly pulled me out of the moment then, and it‚Äôs the same thing that‚Äôs pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision.¬†

In the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren‚Äôt just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot into the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach.¬†

It was bigger than any silverfish I‚Äôd ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was easily 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinnergoers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation.¬†

Wildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher up into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish in total, one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely more than 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn‚Äôt been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering quickly around in my peripheral vision.¬†

I shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn‚Äôt yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn‚Äôt tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered that I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.

Not long after I parked, I began to see silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force managed to launch a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my Sudan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard the sound of an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:

*Hello Zach,*

*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.*¬†

*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal‚Äôs neck saying: ‚ÄúI am ready to mate‚Äù. This is why we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium do not naturally inhabit.*¬†

*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body ‚Äúlearns‚Äù to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.*¬†

*I still recommend considering physical relocation, I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have urgently shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.*¬†

*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week‚Äôs supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*

*Amy,*

When I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche, I felt like I was buried in an instant. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Relocating would also force me to quit my job, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me.¬†

When Zygentra Plus finally arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn‚Äôt come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. I would pull over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me.¬†

I hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every two fucking hours. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don‚Äôt think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.

Out of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed at all times. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all through the morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.

I didn't come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.

Amy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn‚Äôt much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren‚Äôt much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation like I was some human danish. And I still wasn‚Äôt sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide that I was digesting and releasing into the air around me from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with ‚ÄúLucius Bartleby‚Äù, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:

*‚ÄúWell, that will be impossible. Lucius Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.‚Äù*

But don‚Äôt worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some of the symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it did help. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide.¬†I'm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.

The zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words ‚Äústrong acid‚Äù in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down I started to see silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.

I could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn‚Äôt have much of a ‚Äúdermis‚Äù left after Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin. 

Effectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me to tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke. 

Thought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I‚Äôm not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am, I‚Äôm sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital. Plus, who knows if the medications they'd give me would interact with the supplements.

So, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? Or at least have a homeopathic remedy to help stop the bugs?

Or at least a remedy to stop the bugs? ,"I‚Äôve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I‚Äôm just trying to navigate the world as best I can like everyone else. My sister always said I‚Äôm more gullible than I should be at my age - very suggestible is a nicer way to put it I think. My beliefs and convictions are like loose flower petals on a gusty day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I‚Äôm floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I‚Äôm floating west. One day, I‚Äôll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it‚Äôs a hoax. I know, it‚Äôs pathetic. I swear to God I‚Äôll change if I can make it through this year, but I‚Äôve exhausted my savings, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off.

It all started a few weeks ago. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I‚Äôve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn‚Äôt born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn‚Äôt find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I was never able to grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like ‚ÄúMuscle Matrix‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrazy Muscle‚Äù. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage. Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.

Terrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. Nothing I was recommended online seemed to have the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy in comparison to other guys my age. I could feel myself starting to give up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship in general. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker.¬†

It read something like this:

*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen‚Äôs eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don‚Äôt live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, Lucius Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.*¬†

In big, confident words, the bottom said:

*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you. Email* [*zygentraNOW@gmail.com*](mailto:zygentraNOW@gmail.com) *for details.*

Even though the advertisement didn‚Äôt even mention what it would fix about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù, ‚Äútechnology‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows.

But this advertisement seemed to promote something more ‚Äúof the earth‚Äù and ""organic"", the so-called ‚Äúnatural attraction technology‚Äù. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company.¬†

Like I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.

With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised about the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.

At first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It‚Äôs what drew me towards her in the first place. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn‚Äôt as fearful of rejection anymore. As the date progressed, I was shocked to find out that Stacy had also been stockpiling the courage to ask me on a date:

*‚ÄúOver the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.‚Äù* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn‚Äôt want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra.¬†

She giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection. I think she was under the impression that the part about the skin regimen was a playful joke. Then she said something that made my head spin:

*‚ÄúNo, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always respectful and polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôd say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense.‚Äù* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession. ¬†

Her words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you‚Äôre radiant. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.‚Äù*

The expression on her face changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually did manage to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something abruptly pulled me out of the moment then, and it‚Äôs the same thing that‚Äôs pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision.¬†

In the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren‚Äôt just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot into the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach.¬†

It was bigger than any silverfish I‚Äôd ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was easily 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinnergoers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation.¬†

Wildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher up into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish in total, one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely more than 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn‚Äôt been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering quickly around in my peripheral vision.¬†

I shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn‚Äôt yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn‚Äôt tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered that I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.

Not long after I parked, I began to see silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force managed to launch a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my Sudan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard the sound of an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:

*Hello Zach,*

*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.*¬†

*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal‚Äôs neck saying: ‚ÄúI am ready to mate‚Äù. This is why we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium do not naturally inhabit.*¬†

*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body ‚Äúlearns‚Äù to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.*¬†

*I still recommend considering physical relocation, I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have urgently shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.*¬†

*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week‚Äôs supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*

*Amy,*

*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals*¬†



When I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche, I felt like I was buried in an instant. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Relocating would also force me to quit my job, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me.¬†

When Zygentra Plus finally arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn‚Äôt come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. I would pull over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me.¬†

I hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every two fucking hours. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don‚Äôt think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.

Out of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed at all times. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all through the morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.

I didn't come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.

Amy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn‚Äôt much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren‚Äôt much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation like I was some human danish. And I still wasn‚Äôt sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide that I was digesting and releasing into the air around me from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with ‚ÄúLucius Bartleby‚Äù, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:

*‚ÄúWell, that will be impossible. Lucius Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.‚Äù*

But don‚Äôt worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some of the symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it did help. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide.¬†I'm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.

The zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words ‚Äústrong acid‚Äù in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down I started to see silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.

I could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn‚Äôt have much of a ‚Äúdermis‚Äù left after Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin. 

Effectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me to tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke. 

Thought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I‚Äôm not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am, I‚Äôm sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital. Plus, who knows if the medications they'd give me would interact with the supplements.

So, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? Or at least have a homeopathic remedy to help stop the bugs?

Righteous

Say your prayers and read your scriptures,
Go to church and confess your sins.
You don‚Äôt feel the Holy Ghost?
You just need more faith, try it again. 

Always pay your 10%,
Even if you can‚Äôt buy food.
Don‚Äôt drink that coffee or the tea,
Oh, and you can never be in a bad mood. 

The faithful are always happy, 
Blessings rain down from above.
But the truth is not so simple,
Lies disguised as what we‚Äôre told is love.

Love the Lord thy God with all your heart, 
And your neighbor as thyself.
But not if they‚Äôre  gay, or atheist,
Or heaven forbid have the Koran on their shelf. 

Your purity is most important,
Your body is a temple.
so no tattoos or piercings, 
Appear as if you follow Christ‚Äôs example.

Always live temple worthy,
you should go there every week.
Spend all your time to serve the dead,
because the kingdom of God you must seek.

But is this really what God wants?

Does he want you to be miserable,
Feeling weighted down and suppressed?
Making you feel that if you had more faith, 
Maybe you wouldn‚Äôt be so depressed?

Would he tell you that your chromosomes
are the most importantly part?
And that if cis isn‚Äôt how you are,
A worthy soul must guard?

Because the church has a monopoly,
On all the truth and light.
You can‚Äôt be a non believer,
You simply are not right.

Man can worship the way he wants,
And we claim that privilege too.
But actually, that doesn‚Äôt apply,
If you‚Äôve left the one and only true.

Let‚Äôs not forget our prophet,
Joseph Smith the seer.
He translated the Book with a magic rock,
And married 33 wives‚Ä¶how pure.

The church makes lots of claims,
It‚Äôs the only religion that is true.
But all the lies make you realize,
what matters is that God loves you.

And so he wants you to follow his Son.
Love the people that you meet.
Because the lives we change and love we show is what matters at Jesus‚Äô feet.

We can‚Äôt save ourselves with our works,
Our efforts will surely fail.
But God knows what‚Äôs inside your heart,
And His love and mercy will prevail.


I know many in this group are now agnostic or atheist. That‚Äôs actually been one of the areas I‚Äôm still scared to start applying this new lens too. So for now I sit with a belief in a God who I believe is different than the one I was taught about as a TBM. 
This group has been so incredibly supportive, it‚Äôs the only reason I got on Reddit.  Thank you everyone for your stories, questions, opinions, thoughts, knowledge, guidance, and unconditional love and support.",3,1730237315.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False
1gf61kj,https://desertsuncoffee.com/,The Hijacked Load - a cautionary tale for coffee professionals,"As coffee professionals, we understand the importance of managing supply chains efficiently and securely.  But what happens when that chain is compromised by cybercrime?  Recently, I experienced a situation where a full truckload of coffee was stolen, and I want to share my story so you can learn from it and safeguard your operations.
It all began in a routine manner.  Our roastery was in need of replenishing our green coffee supply.  We placed our order with the warehouse and reached out to our broker to arrange shipment of the load.  If you‚Äôre not aware of how this process works, the broker posts the job on a load board, which is where carriers/drivers can see available loads.  A carrier chooses the load, reaches out to the broker, and from there, arrangements are made to pick up the product and deliver it.  That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work.
But this time, things took a turn for the worst.  
I contracted a broker to move a full truckload of coffee from our coffee supply warehouse to my roastery.  Unbeknownst to us, someone had hacked into the load board where my broker had posted the job.  This individual, who I‚Äôll refer to as the ‚ÄúHijacker‚Äù, assumed the role of a legitimate carrier.  My broker, unaware of the hack, provided the Hijacker with all the necessary details to pick up the load.  But the Hijacker had other plans.  Instead of delivering the load, they reposted the job using the same information, but this time under their own fraudulent listing, double brokering the load.  Double brokering is an illegal practice in the freight industry where a broker or carrier transfers a load to another company without the shipper‚Äôs knowledge or consent.
A new carrier, a legitimate one this time, picked up the job.  Not having a clue that they‚Äôre stuck in the middle of this scam.  Their truck got loaded with my coffee, and at this point, both the carrier and I were being played.  
Delivery day arrived, and I reached out to my broker to confirm the delivery time.  That‚Äôs when the nightmare started to unravel.  After some back-and-forth, my broker admitted they had no idea where the truck was.  Panic set in as they scrambled to figure out what went wrong.  The Hijacker, still posing as the carrier, claimed that the truck was 30 miles away and demanded to be paid before delivering, which is not how this typically works; payment comes after delivery.  My broker, of course, refused to pay because if they did, the Hijacker wouldn‚Äôt pay the innocent carrier who had the freight.  
Days passed, and with no sign of the coffee, I was left hoping that the carrier would get fed up and deliver it anyway.  But the Hijacker likely told the carrier that I was refusing to pay for the delivery and to hold off on delivering the coffee.  The carrier, now caught in the middle of the scam, had no reason to trust me.
Then came the extortion attempt.  The Hijacker contacted my broker again and promised to deliver the load within 30 minutes if they received payment.  Feeling the pressure, the broker reluctantly paid.  But an hour later, the Hijacker claimed the truck had broken down in a nearby town and demanded more money to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù it before delivery.  
The broker called the police to look for the truck.  Additionally, I got in my car and drove around the entire region trying to locate the truck.  No truck, no coffee, nothing.
We spent the following days contacting truck stops in the area, hoping that the truck might be parked somewhere, waiting for instructions.  The poor carrier, likely distraught and unaware of the scam, was probably waiting to hear from the Hijacker that payment was on its way.  The worst part? We had no way to contact the carrier directly, and every attempt to locate the truck came up empty.
At this point, my broker decided to file a claim with their insurance company.  They told me it could take up to nine months to resolve, which was disheartening, to say the least.  I then contacted my own insurance broker, reporting the theft and starting the claims process.  But this is where things took another frustrating turn.
I dug up an email exchange from two years prior with my insurance broker, where I had clearly outlined that I needed full coverage for the total value of any coffee being transported from the warehouse to my location.  In the email, I had specified that while most carriers typically have $100,000 worth of coverage, I need additional insurance to bring the total coverage to $135,000.  My broker acknowledged this, and I assumed that everything had been taken care of.
But as the pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place, I realized there were two major problems.  First, my broker had only insured me for the $35,000 above the $100,000 that most carriers carry ‚Äì without ensuring that the full $135,000 of coverage I requested was in place.  Second, and more critically, there was no carrier to claim against.  The scam had left us with no legitimate carrier to hold accountable for the $100,000 insurance that should have covered part of the load.
On top of that, I learned that my insurance only covered accidents or damages, not theft or cybercrime.  In other words, the very situation I had been trying to protect myself from wasn‚Äôt even covered.   The insurance broker‚Äôs failure to ensure the right coverage was a clear case of negligence, and I began to consider the possibility of pursuing legal action.
After everything, I reached out to my insurance broker, only to be told that my current insurance agent won‚Äôt cover the entire cost of the load.  Now I‚Äôm actively searching for a new insurance provider, one that can protect me against the full range of risks-whether it‚Äôs theft, cyber theft, accidents, or damage.
In the end, my transportation broker managed to come through with a check for $100,000, but it left me asking- where does the fault really lie?  Should the responsibility have fallen on the warehouse that mistakenly loaded the coffee onto the wrong truck?  Was it the transportation broker‚Äôs failure to properly vet the carrier?  Or was it my insurance broker‚Äôs neglect in not ensuring the coverage that I specifically requested?
These questions left me reflecting on my own role as well- should I have been more diligent?  Could I have done more to prevent this from happening?  The truth is, I got lucky this time.  But I hope no one reading this has to go through a similar ordeal.
A few key lessons for coffee professionals:
1. Review your insurance coverage: Make sure your insurance policies cover all scenarios, not just accidents but also theft and cybercrime.  Don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre fully covered-double check and be thorough.
2. Hold your transportation brokers accountable: While brokers can‚Äôt always prevent scams, it‚Äôs crucial to have a clear understanding of their vetting processes for carriers.  Ensure you have written agreements in place, outlining who is liable in the event of mishaps
3. Know who‚Äôs responsible at each step:  From the warehouse to the broker, and even yourself, it‚Äôs important to understand the chain of accountability.  Make sure every party involved knows their role and responsibility in safeguarding your product.
4. Consider two-factor authentication at pickup: Adding an extra layer of verification at the warehouse could help prevent double brokering or accidental loading onto the wrong truck. Simple but effective security measures like this can make a big difference.
5. Stay proactive:  Don‚Äôt wait for disaster to strike.  Take action now by reassessing your contracts, reviewing your insurance, and staying vigilant with your brokers.
As an industry, we need to put pressure on all parties involved to ensure these scams become less frequent.

Had my first endoscopy a week ago and the doctor said I have ~1.5 cm of Barrett's esophagus, he did biopsy to be safe and I get the results in 2 weeks, but the GI said it's extremely unlikely there is any dysplasia. GI didn't say anything about diet other than to lose weight and increased my PPIs.

I had to see my primary care doctor for unrelated reasons and I brought up my new diagnosis. PCP said I have to immediately stop all alcohol, chocolate, and caffeine use.

This seems extreme. I have maybe 4-6 beers in an entire week and 1-2 coffees or energy drinks a day. But I can't imagine never drinking again or getting rid of coffee. I did some reading about it online and it seems like studies aren't even in agreement, some even said wine has some things in it that reduce the incidence of Barretts.

Do y'all still drink booze and coffee in moderation?

My husband and I are flying to Paris on Christmas night, landing on the 26th in the morning (my birthday) and staying until the 29th, where we are taking the train to London for the next stop of our trip. I am hoping Paris Travel Guide can provide feedback on my below itinerary. 

Some things to know about my husband and I, we in our early 30s, are huge foodies, like to shop, are OK with walking a lot, and don't have too strict of a budget. We're not too into history, nor do we feel the need to go inside the Eiffel Tower. Also, since its winter, we aren't planning to do Versailles, we think we can save that for a warmer weather visit. 

**Day 1:** After dropping our bags off at the hotel we plan to get a quick coffee/pastry at one of the following spots: **Sevenly Heart, Noir, French Bastards.** We are then planning to do the Hop On Hop Off Bus to knock out all the major sites (Notre Dame, Musee d'Orsay, Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, etc.). We plan to hop off to do shopping (please let me know any cute boutiques for women's clothing or home goods!) and grab lunch throughout the day. Some lunch options I have saved are **Boiullion Cartier, Allard, Les Deux Magots, La Coupole.** Ideally we will want to end the day at Galleries Lafayette to watch the sunset from the roof. I am really hoping to snag a reservation at **Septime** for dinner this night as its my birthday, but thinking either **Maxim's** or **La Renommee Paris** could be good back ups.

**Day 2:** We would like to start the day at a cafe, perhaps \*\***Caf√© de Flore** (\*\*touristy, but i feel like you gotta do it?), **Angelina, or Baguett's Caf√©.** This is our designated Louvre day, as we already have tickets for the AM and plan on spending a lot of time wandering around the museum. We plan on getting a late take away lunch from one of the following places **Groot, Chez Alain Miam Miam, Caractere de Cochon**. Followed by a drink at **Little Red Door, Bisou, or Bar Nouveau**. We are aiming to do **Le Relais de l‚ÄôEntrec√¥te** for dinner this night, with perhaps **Bistrot Paul Bert** as our back up if the line is too crazy.

**Day 3:** Planning to hit **Mamiche** for a quick bite and coffee before exploring the neighborhood of Montmartre. **Hardware Society** or **Pink Mamma** look good for potential lunch spots.  The afternoon we have kind of saved as free time to give ourselves room to hit anything we missed in the last couple days or just do some shopping. I am between going to a pre-dinner drink at **Bar Hemingway** OR going to do a wine and cheese pairing at **Les Petits Crus** before heading to dinner at **Frenchie Bar A Vins.**

**Day 4:** Our train leaves for London at 11am, how far in advance do you recommend going to the train station due to customs?

So what do you think? Am I missing anything obvious for a first timer? Thanks in advance for your kind feedback, we are so looking forward to exploring your fine city!",1,1730237059.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.6,False

my dad left our family in 2022, just before my GCSE exams. look them up if you don‚Äôt know what they are (hopefully that doesn‚Äôt sound rude). luckily, although my dad leaving us hurt, i got through my exams and passed flying colours. 

he used to take me out and spend time with me, specifically, every sunday or so. usually a coffee shop. he used to take me to a gaming convention twice a year but not anymore since the convention has been cancelled.

anyways, since then, i‚Äôve gotten a permanent job. it‚Äôs great. i‚Äôve started college. he‚Äôs gotten with a new woman, left his job, and become a raging alcoholic.

i feel he‚Äôs started to avoid me. we go out absolutely nowhere. he forgets EVERYTHING about me. he texts and calls my brother often, and not me absolutely at All. he comes over about once a week and every single time it‚Äôs while i‚Äôm at work, or while i‚Äôm unavailable somehow. a few weeks ago, we were staying at my grandparents. he came over to pick my brother up and couldn‚Äôt wait TWO MINUTES before i was dressed to say hello to me. a few weeks ago, he tried to stop my mom from picking me up from work (i live in an awful, unsafe town, my mom insists on picking me up especially now that it‚Äôs darker. he knows this). a week ago, while i was at work, he took my brother out to plane spot at a local airfield. i didn‚Äôt even get a text. i understand if he couldn‚Äôt wait until i got home to see me - his new girlfriend is crazy - but just one text would‚Äôve been nice. he‚Äôs coming over tomorrow, and knowing him, will probably pick a time i‚Äôm not there. or, he‚Äôll be drunk and pushing politics on us so i wont want to talk to him. Or, he‚Äôll be arguing with my mom. 

the question is How Exactly do i bring this up with my dad and tell him just how upset i am? how do i cope with the fact he‚Äôll try to blame it on me or his chronic pain? the thing is i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs intentionally trying to hurt me. none of this is calculated or anything. but i don‚Äôt know what to say or do. if anyone has any advice that would be awesome :(",1,1730236715.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gf5t0r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf5t0r,Recently diagnosed with low B12 ,"TLDR: Recently diagnosed with low B12 and ferritin. Taking cyanocobalamin 1mg x1 per day in AM and ferrous sulphate 200mg x1 per day. Along with a multivitamin, vitamin D3 and omega 3,6 & 9. 

Is there anything else I should be doing to help such as taking other supplements, going to bed earlier/waking up later or resting more than I'm 'doing' for example housework, hobbies, socialising etc. Would it be better to take ferrous sulphate in the AM as I'm currently taking it in the afternoon?

I'm F 33 based in UK. I've attached my blood test results for serum B12, serum ferritin, serum folate, haemoglobin and my iron level.

Lifestyle factors:

- Vegan diet (since 2018)
- Smoker (since early teens)
- Little to no exercise (only walking to/from work on weekdays - work in an office so sat down most of the day)
- Terrible for drinking water, mainly drink tea/coffee

Symptoms I can relate to for B12/iron/folate deficiency that I've read in the guide:

‚Ä¢ ADHD-like symptoms (especially with executive function such as prioritising tasks, memory and staying focused/easily distracted - earlier in the year I thought I may have ADHD, now I'm thinking the symptoms I experience are more likely linked to B12 deficiency as I've not struggled in the past with the above as intensely as I have recently)
‚Ä¢ Anxiety 
‚Ä¢ Brain fog
‚Ä¢ Chest pain 
‚Ä¢ Fatigue 
‚Ä¢ Heart palpitations 
‚Ä¢ Insomnia 
‚Ä¢ Altered menstrual cycle
‚Ä¢ No libido
‚Ä¢ Muscle spasms and twitches 
‚Ä¢ Muscle soreness
‚Ä¢ Nail changes (little to no half moons, vertical ridges, a few nails have beau's lines)
‚Ä¢ Paresthesia (most noticeable in my legs but also sometimes in my arms and fingers)
‚Ä¢ Shortness of breath (this may also be caused by bring a long term smoker)
‚Ä¢ Dizziness (can happen when I'm stood up or just sat down, sometimes it also happens when I yawn it's such a weird sensation and the only way I can explain it is that my whole body feels 'fuzzy' I had a bad experience this morning after I got up where I felt so dizzy/unsteady that I almost fell backwards)
‚Ä¢ General weakness (I feel like I used to be quite strong considering I'm quite a slim build, but now I feel so weak and sometimes just holding up my phone or toothbrush makes my arm muscles feel weak and fatigued)

It's possible there are more, I'm just not sure what some of the names of things listed mean, so will investigate those further.

I feel quite a range of emotions right now - angry, frustrated, upset and disappointed. In previous years I'd felt symptoms I've mentioned and I was diagnosed with depression, now I wonder if I was actually deficient in something (likely iron as this was way lower than I am now back in 2015 but I fell within the markers of a normal range at the time). At the start of this year I was prescribed ferrous fumarate due to low iron but the GP never advised me to come back for a follow up blood test - something I've now been advised to do following the 3 month course I'm currently on. I feel sad because I'm struggling to get through each day of just normal daily life, I don't feel like I'm living I'm just existing and this is very much how I've spent majority of this year. I'm a shadow of the person I feel I used to be and it's so depressing.
I just hope that in time I'll be able to bring back the person I used to be. 

If you've read this far down, thank you, I really appreciate it and if you're able to offer any advice, support or tips I would greatly appreciate that too!",2,1730236690.0,B12_Deficiency,1,1.0,False

I write in 3rd person, past tense and tend to write several paragraphs! I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moved forward. 

OC‚Äôs only & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I prefer at least 2 'main characters' per person, with a reoccurring side character or two that can get more 'screen time' if we like them! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! **If you really only want to play one MC that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story!**

I am a queer nonbinary guy myself, and I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters & queer pairings, but I genuinely care most about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do not like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay eventually - if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

Now onto the fun stuff!! 

**Modern settings / plot ideas:** main craving right now is centered around a horse ranch, a la Yellowstone. We can also add some of the following elements or keep them separate:

Small town with the classic troupe of childhood friends / sweethearts where one moved away and one stayed. Can include the one who moved getting famous and falling from fame or moving back for PR reasons. 

Single parents / exs / coparents

Getting off on the wrong foot troupe paired with forced proximity - neighbors / co-workers / roommates who find out they are in AA together / get a new job together/ become neighbors, something like that! Enemies to friend to lovers vibes! 

Something centered around a coffee shop - could be paired with a local or new to town musician who starts performing there or just a new hire or regular. 

I could also be convinced to do a post-apocalyptic setting on a ranch, but this would needeven more collaborative plotting!


**Medieval fantasy ideas:** my go to for this is usually some kind of arranged marriage - it's an overused troupe, but it's a good excuse to get the characters together and there's always tons of drama built in! My default fantasy system is d&d as a base but we can collaborate on lore! 

I currently have a specific idea with for an age gap between an older knight & a princess engaged to someone else. It's a classic rescue story a the beginning and we can discuss plot points moving forward!

I also write over Discord - I'll send that out after we chat a little! Feel free to send me a message or chat request if you're interested! Let me know what plots / ideas you liked and please add your own!! Collaborating and plotting together are really important to keeping the story going! ",2,1730236514.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

I had a chat with the hiring manager who spent some time asking me to describe what I do now and how I would invest $50 million. My main question was whether it would be worth it for me to apply because I know I have a lot of the soft skills but I lack the hard skills and experience needed. The hiring manager told me bluntly that he would highly recommend I apply. It‚Äôs an associate position so I shouldn‚Äôt be worried that I lack experience, they expect associates to need to be trained. He did tell me that he was looking for someone very specific for this posting but he‚Äôs 50/50 whether he will find what he was looking for or not. He told me the first basket of candidates will be applicants with what he is specifically searching for and if he doesn‚Äôt get any  then the second basket will be competitive candidates which I would be in. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month since the job has been posted and about three weeks since I last spoke to him. My application is still ‚Äúunder review‚Äù and I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs still looking at other candidates. I have two questions. 

1. Should I send him a follow up teams message/email along the lines of ‚Äúplease let me know if there‚Äôs any information I can provide‚Äù kind of thing. I worry that because it‚Äôs internal and we have been talking on Teams that it could put him in a weird position and put more pressure on him to reply which may not be a wise thing to do. 

2. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get this position in the first place but I definitely want to stay in touch with this guy. He‚Äôs the managing director of one of New York teams and as a Canadian, my best path to working in the US is an internal transfer (plus I want to stay with my company). Would it be a good idea if I reach out to him for a coffee chat in person because I wanted to learn more about what he does, etc? I really want to fly down for a day to have a chat with him, and if even possible, shadow his team but I don‚Äôt want to come across as too overzealous or putting him in a difficult position

There's cracks everywhere and everything. It's up and down. Cracks and slides. But I do like Reno.  
  
I think it's a beautiful place. And for the most part, there's kind people here, and it just depends on which area you're in.  
  
I‚Äôm Darrel. I‚Äôm 44 and I used to work in a restaurant as a server. I‚Äôve also been an EMT.   
  
Last winter, I slipped on black ice and broke my tibia, fibula, ankle, and part of my foot. I lost my apartment a month later because I lost my job.  
  
In my wheelchair, it takes me two hours just to get to a gas station.  
  
I used to live right there, near the Wild River Grille.    
  
I am now staying at the Cares Campus, which feels horrible.   
  
There's a lot of people who just, they treat you like they're above you.   
  
I couldn't work, so I ended up there.  If I can find a job that allows me to kind of stumble around and use my wheelchair, I‚Äôd be happy to work again.   
  
During the day, I try to come closer to downtown so I can stay away from all the anger and there's a lot of vulgar language. You know? Down on 4th Street?  
  
And the food sucks at the Cares Campus. I refuse to even go to the food section. They, like, serve the same stew. Or it‚Äôs things that don't go together. And then they feed you at four o'clock. That's dinner.  
  
And then breakfast is at six o'clock in the morning. But they only give you a doughnut. And they took away the coffee, which I don't drink anyways. I don't care. I try to eat my meals elsewhere.    
  
But what if someone's diabetic? So they don't eat in the morning. From four o'clock in the afternoon. Like, what if they don't have food stamps?  
  
I mean, it does help people, and there's a lot of people who may have some good case managers, and they really try to get you out of there.   
  
Certain people, they treat differently. I'm not gonna lie.  
  
As long as it's sunny and I'm out of there, that's a good day if I can go somewhere peaceful.  
  
That's why I come over to the river and stuff, where it's quiet, and I can have conversations.  
  
It's a better environment for me mentally.   
  
We should have a book club at the Cares Campus, or have something to get people mentally stimulated instead of just waiting.  
  
Like something to keep their mind off of their urges.  
  
They need things that are more positive and not just everyone talking down to you.   
  
My message to the community? Just be positive to each other, and you'll receive positivity.  
  
If you're sending out negativity, you're gonna receive negativity.‚Äù

I have a 10 month old daughter who decided to wake up at 2 AM and not go back to sleep (until I put her in our bed when I was leaving and she fell asleep 5 minutes after I left). No worries! She‚Äôs lucky she‚Äôs a cutie pie and I‚Äôve worked on 4 hours of sleep many times.

Made it to the station, VMA1 in Westborough, MA which is around 30 minutes from me. I found my cart and it was going to Brighton, MA. 48 packages, 46 stops. Uh oh. I thought could get there before rush hour so it‚Äôs fine. I mark all of the stop numbers on the packages per usual and organized them into my car. There was one package that said it was removed from my route. Sweet, ONLY 45 stops now.

I start driving. My GPS says 1 hour, 7 minutes. Awesome‚Ä¶. But still could be worse. I throw on a podcast, drink my coffee, and do the drive.

I‚Äôm getting within 1 mile of my first stop so I open the app. It says that I‚Äôm heading to stop 34. What? I look at the package in the passenger seat and the addresses don‚Äôt match. Turns out my whole route order was adjusted so my organization was out the window. Oh, and add on top of it that one of the packages was marked ‚Äúdo not deliver‚Äù and the app told me to return it to station. No. I left it at the person‚Äôs doorstep.

So yea, my nice easy 4 hour block turned into a 5 hour block. F*ck Amazon Flex.

The end. I forgot to take screenshots except the one I attached because I was pissed and sleep deprived. My fun of them to add ‚ÄúLATE‚Äù to all of the deliveries because of their screw up.",4,1730236114.0,AmazonFlexDrivers,4,1.0,False

So a bit of background. Me (23 Female ) have this best friend we will call her ""E"" (24 Female/ nonbinary) had this friend ""B"" (25 Female) who was a complete mental drain case. My best friend will also post about what B has done specifically towards her soon after this post goes up 

Lets start from the begining before me and E figured out how manipulative she was. So we have to start in the year of 2019 where my pregnant cousin was in an accident and had a C section and go through physical therapy afterwards. I started babysitting for her around this time but it was barely 3 time a month and around this Me, E and B ( 18, 19 and 20 at the time) started hanging out together as a trio. I babysat my cousins daughter let's call her ""C"" more so when she was about 9 months old and when she turned 1 year old. Now around this time we where all good except there was some comments here and there from B saying E was the ugly fat friend and I was the dumb stupid friend but we kinda just dismissed it at the time. 

Now B and E are heavier set girls where I was the  kinda chubby but still visiblely curvy kinda between skinny and curvy. E was chubby and a bigger girl but B was the one very noticable gaining weight and once said that she was put on this highly processed diet of freezer meals and such because ""healthy foods gave her problems."" Which I thought it was a little werid becuase how does it give you problems unless you where allergic. As far as I know she wasn't allergic to anything. 

But anyway as time qhent on I found out in the year 2020 that my cousin was pregnant again and had her son who I'll call ""D"" in 2021. This is where issues started up. Sometime before D was born, E whent to a ward to help with her mental health for a bit it was about like a week before she got out and the day or two after E got out B blasted my phone around 9 or 10 in the morning (which is hella early for me) about going swimming at a lake. I agreed and B asked me to message E since she wasn't picking up. 

I got my stuff ready and messaged her but I had feeling that she was still sleeping since me and E do have various sleep problems and sometimes don't get up around noon. Either way B and her mom ""J"" picked me up and whent to E house and as I figured she was asleep. E was reluctant to go since she was on meds that made her sleepy I said if you wanted to come we can stay in the shallower end of the lake or shore if she was still a bit drowsy. 

She agreed and soon we where at the beach. As J did laps in the lake. Us three kinda swam/float around since I do NOT know how to swim. I know how to move my arms but I'm unsure about how to move my legs in the water. so I used a donut floatie. E playfully and barely tipped my floatie to get me to ""swim"" as a joke but then B SHOVED my head under water and we where at the 5 feet almost 6 feet deep into the water and I'm short around 5'3 Luckly I was able to get myself above water and back into my floatie. B laughed and said come on get your hair and head wet. I told her I was good and whent on swimming. E eventually needed to go back to shore since she felt sleepy and I whent back with her meanwhile B laughed and kept swimming. Other then that we had a good time and whent to a near by pizza place which had a nostalgic favorite type of pizza of mine that most pizzas places don't have.  

Fast forward towards after D was born 
I was over there alot due to my cousin jerk asshole of a husband wanting to go back to work asap and the fact it was easier for me to stay over some nights instead of going back and forth sleep deprived. Around this time money was getting a little tighter so my cousin wasn't paying me nightly but she was paying me either weekly or biweekly. Me personally didn't care too much at the time since it was tight and her husband wasn't exactly helpful so I told her she can just buy me coffee from dunkin, fast food or stuff from the store to have for the house and pay me when she can. Sometimes I wouldn't get payed for a couple of weeks sometimes a month 

Apparently this upsetted B becuase she could say things like she is using you and is never around the kids (looking back now she actually wasn't wrong becuase me and my cousin did have a falling out but thats a story for a diffrent time.) My cousin was still in going to physical therapy, getting pain medication almost daily and still had to work in basically constant pain. So there are days where she just wanted to lay down after work which is of course understandable. 

Everyone and a while B and E will come over to pick me up to hang out. Now during one of these times I was feeding D a bottle and D was only about 2 - 5 months old still needed to be bottle feed and they came over as I was feeding him. While E was playing with C. B kept watching either me or the TV while I fed D. 

I'm not apart of a Itty bitty titty community I have decently size melons and baby's sometimes get a little confused on where the nipple part is and almost tried to feed off me. But once I got the bottle in his mouth he fed from the bottle. Apparently this bothered her becuase she brought it up sometime after we left and along with the fact that my cousin ""doesn't pay"" me. She made it a big deal claiming that the kids think I'm their mother all becuase D got confused and C was starting to say mama to me while she was just starting to talk and make little sentences. What also seemed bothered B was that D did grab my boob here and there occasionally but like I said he is a baby they tend to grab them they are in their nature and all of the time he was just grabbing my shirt. 

When I explained that D got confused and C was starting to form small sentences and I wasn't about to force her to call me my full name untill she was able to say bigger words. I will tell her no my name is C to correct her but she is barely 2 years old so she is still developing, her words and sentences. B let it go or so I thought. 

There was even a time when I had the kids at my house for a day because my cousin was deep cleaning and didn't want them to make mess while she is cleaning and B came over and just chilled with me. C was taking a nap in a play pen I set by my fish tank and D was just chilling a bouncy chair or on my lap. B kept looking at me while I was holding D. I asked if she wanted to hold him. She said yes and I handed him to her and he immediately started to cry. So I took him back and put him in his bouncy chair. Once he calmed down I got up and whent to get him some food to eat and he started crying again. It only took me a minute to make his little baby oatmeal and I came back and feed him. 

Now this shit is about to go down at this point. In March of 2022 I took the kids out on one of the first days it was nice out for lunch. We walked there enjoying the fresh air and sunshine after being indoors due to the winter. The kids had fun and I did post some pictures of them on my Facebook. A couple of older people there thought they where my kids and came up to me a couple of times while eating. But I've explain to them that I actually there cousin who was babysitting them. They where mostly surprised due to on how similar we looked which isn't surprising since my cousin's mom and my mom are actually sisters and people have said on how closely related we looked alot to the point I should have a t-shirt lol. 

That night my grandma commented on my post on how adorable it was and aftrr i told her about the old people thinking i was the mom. B kinda whent off on her claiming that im around them too much and they think im there mom and i should have to take them out for any lunchs or anything. I wasnt forced i wanted to and i wanted to get out of the house as well just for a few minutes. I have tried to calm her down a few times and explain that it's fine and no one is offended here. My grandma has seen me be confused for the mom first hand meanwhile there mom is usually standing next to me. They only assumed I was the mom was becuase I would be holding either a kid, stroller or carrier. So as I was trying to explain that to B she wouldn't listen and kept claiming that I wasn't taking this seriously. After that I pretty much deleted mostly all of her comments off that post. B also called my grandma a Karen due to this. 

A few days after that I received a startling message from B and E that basically that they where cutting me out of their lives. They sent me a document stating the reasons that they wouldn't be friends with me and as I'm reading this doc which brought up the fact when we where at the beach and I made she E was ok and they had made it seem that i was the toxic one. Claiming that im never home and they brought up the whole Arby's post claiming thay I wanted people to find it becuase it was on public veiw. At the time I didn't know my Facebook was on public since I had put it on private but they had some many options on what to have public and private that I must have mixed a couple up of settings up. But either way I didnt notice the fact it didn't make any sense because I was panicing hard and having a wash of mixed emotions, tears and trying to explain myself. That I failed to realize was that the document brought up an ex only E was aware of.

Also that I apparently force B to hold D and B didn't like it when I left D alone for a moment. He was perfect fine for a minute in his bouncy chair which he was strapped into.

(Please no hate to E as she was manipulated by B and forced to listen to B) 

I was dating this guy who was another complete crazy narc which I'm happy that it was an online relationship becuase if it was a irl relationship i probably would havd sent his ass to jail. E knew the full detail about the stuff he said / well do to me in the future. Where as B did not. They brought up on how we broke up a few times and whent back to and made it seem that I was dating him at the time which I wasn't we broke up in 2019. But like I said at the time I was in wreck and apologized for my behavior. And we stopped speaking for eachother 

Now sometime after that there was a bit of a domestic problem between my cousin and her husband and I didn't know how it was going to go down so I sent them a message explaining what happened and i didnt want that convo be the last convo. I told them that I'm alright just trying to keep the kids from seeing what was going on. E offered to come over but had no way over but B kept blowing up my phone that night trying to get the ok to have her over and i was trying to keep calm while cooking dinner. As small kids are they could sense something wasn't right and did freak out a bit. I told her no I don't want her to come down becuase I'm trying to destress the kids and my self. I told her that it's appreciated I just wanted to at least reach out and explain what's happened. Soon after me and B where hanging out talking about my ""toxic behavior"" and I explain to her that I truly didn't know that I missed a setting to make it private but soon it all seemed water under the bridge and all three of us whwre soon chilling around the table playing cards against humanity

This is where I start to notice stuff.  

Now around this time. I met someone in town and we met up and hanged out with. And when I mean hanged out I mean maked out. But we never really became a boyfriend or girlfriend type nor did we go all the way but since our schedules where in the way of hanging out alot and I believed he met someone else we kinda just drifted away which happens. So one day as all three of us where hanging out I told E about him and about how we made out a bit. B walked in and asked what we where talking about and so I told her. 

Big mistake. She then whent to tell her mom laughing the whole time and they where making it seemed like I lost my vigriniy and got fucked in some werid places and got married to him because of it.  Which I didn't. Since we never whent all the way with him, but E had a small relationship with someone for a brief moment and B and her mother didn't make any jokes. 

Soon we whwre hanging out almost every single weekend and it was exhausting honestly. We always whent out to eat which most of the time it was Perkins which was a kinda breakfast/ old people food sit in type of restaurant. It was alright but having it all tje time was a bit much. But we whent to other restaurants from time to time. 

One time we whent to a Italian restaurant and I ordered something that came with a pretty big bowl of salad. Which no problem I love salad. In said salad there was a big piece of lettuce that was about mabye bigger then the size of my hand. So I did what anyone with a commonsense brain cell would do and picked up a knife and started to cut it down. B and her mother saw me doing this and basically made fun of me for cutting it claiming I can just shove it in my mouth. I tried to explain that it was still too big for that and I judt rather cut it down so I don't over chew and gag. They didn't listen and kept making fun of me while I ate. I really didn't feel like eating anymore after that but since B and her mom always payed for me and E, I just sat there and ate my food. 

After a few months it became incredibly hard to avoid hanging out since if I didn't want to hang she would basically make me a jerk. We also noticed that anytime we hanged out that B and her mother would get into screaming matchs infront of us then later do a complete 180 and be totaly fine. Even on our birthdays we where hanging out. i was turning 21 so it would be a drinking party lol but ngl i did drink before i was 21 cuz dealing with her a drink or two was needed at this time and she would have bottles of hard lemonade we where allowed to drink but i would one drink at least one bottle. 

Still hanging her was becoming so bad that I was starting to lose my hair and E was starting to shed her hair too. One day after my birthday we where having a sleepover and B whent to sleep and B when to bed and me and E where out in the back porch. I took a deep breath and asked her ""hey can I tell you something that can remain between us."" She said yes and asked what's up. I explained that I've noticed that B behavior and how I even noticed she was begining to talk down to us. Going ""I hear you but."" And completely dismiss what we said. 

E let out a huge ass sigh and said ""oh my God I thought I was the only one."" And we talked till at least 3 am about stuff and then whent to bed. 

Ever since then we where starting to pretty much be on tiptoes walking on eggshells becusse if we said the wrong thing we where suddenly assholes or in the wrong. Remember there screaming matches I said B and her mom had. It was so bad yhat they where starting to argue in Walmart. Me and E would just go ""hey where gonna go look at either jewelry or purses "" abd just leave while they argued. 

Also around this time my sister suffered some extremely back pain and had a medical problem where I was stuck with doing more of the household chores. B had a problem with this and I have explained to her that my sister have a hard time sleeping and such becuase of it. She let it go for now untill.

 One day I whent to a little family reunion at a park. My sister was not in as much pain so she was trying out a tire swing and somehow got stuck in it. It was honestly hilarious and I took a pic and posted onto my snap chat. B saw it and got butt hurt about it claiming if she was able to have fun she should be doing the chores and not me so we can hang out more often. 

Becuase of my sisters back problems she couldn't help our grandparents so one time I whent to help my grandmother , the one she called a karen.  I had a nice time with her and I let B know like a week early that I will be helping her do some stuff which was mostly taking things to her car. Keep in mind she had broke her hip a few months prior and so she was moving slower. We also stopped to get lunch and do a couple of other things. B kept blowing up my phone and kept asking when we will be done becuase she wanted to hang out. I told her I'm not sure yet we still have stuff do to and she complained that I should have been done but she wasn't listening when I told her my grandma made me sit down and relax often. E only asked once if I was on my way home and if everything was alright becuase I kinda started to ignore B. It was fine she was starting to bother me and my grandma noticed and I was just trying not to let her get to me. 

Now onto what I will say the i have saved this last 3 stories best for last. Two of them happen in a restaurant. 

First was in a bar and grill type of restaurant called Applebee's. B was supposed couldn't handle spicy foods claiming that pepperoni was spicy but we have witnessed her eating stuff that's is Spicer or pepperoni. So B ordered a burger and asked for no Mexican ranch and no Pico de gallon and the cheese switched to Swiss. Her mom ordered the same burger but didn't have them take anything out or switch anything. It comes out and B had the burger with the Mexican ranch and Pico de Gallo and the cheese that came with it which was pepper jack. Meanwhile her mom got her burger but it came out with no Mexican ranch, Swiss and no Pico de Gallo. So anyone with a braincell can see that they could just switch plates. Nope they sent it back and soon when the waitress comes out with their new food. The burger was pink and B was freaking out saying it was under cooked and raw. Which it wasn't yes it was pink but you can still eat burgers under like a steak. B was getting pissed at the waitress and made a comment to her mother saying there isnt a problem when its just us."" So she sent it back again and this time the manager came out offered another meal, taking it off the check or a free desert. And she said and I quote ""no, I do not feel safe eating here."" The manager nodded and walked away. Then B complained on how the manager never offered another meal after he walked away. I saw that it was messed up and said why didn't you switch your plates and her mom explained that their order was messed up and basically said out loud thay she had what I ordered and I had what she ordered. I just shaked my head and drank my margarita. Which I really gonna argue cuz again they where paying for. 

Then a couple of weeks later me and E  convinced them to go to a Mexican restaurant. This story is more so kinda focused on her mother (monkey see monkey do I guess) but B did act up a bit here as well. Now this restaurant has EXTREMELY hot plates so waiters will warn you that it is hot and after they dropped of the plates B barley touched it and started freaking out like her hand caught on fire and acting like a little kid. My only reaction was grab my napkin and just moved my plate a little closer to me while staring at her. Her mother gotten tacos but wanted beans instead of rice. The waiter brought out tacos with rice and she said ""oh no I wanted beans not rice."" The waiter apologized and took it back. She was nice about it at first but then her food come back and the tacos where on one plate and the beans where on another and she FLIPPED out on the waiter like it was his doing. Saying how hard is it to put it on one plate and is it thay hard to do your job. I was shocked and watched as the waiter just walked away. And this pissed her off saying she wasn't going to leave a tip. And she ate her food. I think the waiter only came by once to drop off the check and when she whent to pay I whent to the bathroom sneakily with my wallet to look for any cash I had becuase I wanted to leave a tip. I only had one dollar and rather small tip is better then no tip if i can.  Soon E came in and was like what the fuck. I'm leaving a tip. I laughed and told her same so we leave a total of 2 dollars which I hated leaving that small amount but I felt bad on how she snapped at the waiter. We also wrote a note basically apologizing for their behavior. We where gonna just leave it on the table but B was last to leave the table so E directly handed the tip to the waiter and B saw me and asked what was that about I lied saying a waiter or waitress dropped something and wanted to return it. She bought it. 

Now a couple more weeks go on and we already done being her friend but at this point we where only hanging out because of free food. B invited me and E to this little banquet event for some softball team that she was on for people with disabilities. B didn't have disabilities but claimed she was autism to excuse her behavior thoughtout all of these events. The event was the next day and me and E decided to sleep over at Es house after wards and decide how long we where going to hold out on this friend ship. Well we told B that I might be babysitting next day and E says she would go. But the day came and me and E are chilling in her room and B messages E about what time the banquet is and little details about it and I'm sitting there then a thought crosses my head ""why is she just texting you when she invited me as well?"" 

Well I said to E to text her what food options will be there and be said ""oh I didn't invite her becuase there wasn't enough tickets. I only have four. One for mom, dad you and me."" 

Little side note : Her dad was someone we asked not to be around because he gave this creepy vibe and constantly stared at us and we asked her that if she wanted to hang out with him that it was fine but we didn't want to be around him. But the next day we hanged out he was there. She basically dismissed our feelings/concerns and kept him around. But back to the banquet story 


Me and E where confused since one she didn't brought up anything about tickets, or her father was going and the fact she invited the both of us in person while we where next to each other. This was the breaking point for us E texted her saying that she suddenly got sick and couldn't go. B said no problem then go onto text me. Asking if I was able to go. I told her no I was babysitting but in reality me and E made a little document about her behavior and stopped our friendship. 

As of today me and E are still the best of friends and B has tried to reach out to E not once not twice but a total of 10 times mabye more. And has stalked Es house.  She only reached out to me twice and one of the times she stole her mom's phone to message me on. 

Now I have talked long enough it took nearly 2 days to make this I actually covered the basic stuff she has said/ done. E will also post in here covering stuff that B has personally have done to her. If I wrote everything it would probably Charlotte's longest video every. ( if she puts it on video ) I tried to shorten it as best I can but some stuff was just too good not to post.

I have money in savings and my parents allow me and my husband to live with them for free as we have a deal to eventually sell our house and move to more land where we will pay to build my parents dream home (our little exchange). 

So after that small weird intro. How crazy and risky would it be to, instead of finding a second job I loathe, to just go for it and open up my space. I have my business model ready and I was going to start off with a cart but if it could work that I go straight to the shop I will. 

I need the good bad and the ugly about doing this. I need you to tell me if I should stick to the cart first or if it could work cause I can‚Äôt find information online that tells me what to do. I have years of experience in coffee shops. I also have the recipes and everything of what I want to do ready.

Generally, I wake up between 2-4 times a night because I have to pee. I just wish for a full night‚Äôs sleep, that‚Äôs all I want.

It started a couple of years ago when I did my exchange in South Africa, I am from Western Europe myself. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to my exchange there of cours but I can at least remembered it started around that period. I also stopped doing the keto diet around that time, which I ate for a couple of months before that.

I feel like I have tried everything not to wake up at night to have to pee. I don‚Äôt drink coffee or energy drinks, basically I only drink some tea (during the day, not in the evenings) and water. I almost never drink alcohol. I‚Äôve tried by stopping with drinking anything HOURS before I go to sleep, I‚Äôve tried drinking right before I go to sleep. I have no specific diet (e.g. not like I did keto a few years ago) but typically I eat overnight oats with strawberries for breakfast, some bread with turkey and a banana for lunch and something with specifically protein/carbs for dinner. I have also tried pelvic exercises and tried medicine iciine my doctor prescribed to me. But nothing works.

Is there anyone else that has the same problem and maybe tried something different that did work for them? Like I said, all I wish for is a good night‚Äôs sleep.

* ¬£130k in my pension, adding ¬£1.5k per month through my + work's contribution. I pay 15% of my salary, work tops up 5%.
* Student loan is 1 payment away from being paid off, at which point I will bump up my monthly pension contribution to 17%, meaning some gains from no longer paying the student loan go to the pension, some come to me through increased take-home pay.
* ¬£90k in a Stocks & Shares ISA, adding \~¬£1.2k a month. My investment rule is that on pay day I invest 30% of my take home pay + whatever was left in my account the day before pay day. 
* Own 50% of a modest flat worth \~400k, ¬£25k left on my half of the mortgage. Hoping to move somewhere fancier in the next year or so - probably \~¬£600k, so a bigger mortgage and probably a longer payment term.
* No other debts.

Expenditure wise, I am *pretty* frugal (my mobile phone contract is ¬£7 a month!) but I do value experiences + my health. I travel a fair bit - normally 2 months overseas each year. I have a personal trainer who I see twice a week. I like to eat out but probably do it once a week max. So these are my big costs. I don't drink or smoke and very rarely do food delivery, takeaway coffees, or lunches out. I don't own a car and I walk or cycle to most places. I don't have any kids and don't plan to. I don't plan on getting married or any other major expense like that. 

Things I'd love to be able to do in the future:

* Definitely: Retire early, just a question of when. I'd probably first tap in to my S&S ISA, then my private pension, then finally add the state pension.
* Maybe: Get a second property overseas and start splitting my life between two places (and monetise the overseas property when not in it). 

At the moment, I have enough money sitting around that I know that if I lost my job, I could comfortably exist of my savings for literally 3+ years, which is psychologically very comforting. But I feel like I need to substantially ramp up both my pension contributions and my S&S ISA investments if I have a realistic chance of a comfortable FIRE plus my other goal.

Sorry for any mistakes. English is not my first language.

When I was a university student, I fell in love with Daria (not her real name, obviously). She was the little sister of my best friend, so I considered her off-limits, but my crush on her persisted and grew. She‚Äôs one of those beautiful, brilliant people who is alive and breathing to make the world a better place‚Äîhow could I not be drawn to that? One day, she told me she had feelings for me. And to my relief, my best friend didn‚Äôt have a problem with me dating his sister, either. So for two wonderful years, Daria was my girlfriend.

I should have asked her to marry me. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt. I suppose I thought I had all the time in the world. We were young and there was no need to rush things.

We lived in a country that isn‚Äôt exactly democratic, and we were political activists. I ended up getting arrested and going to prison for nine years. (Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some kind of monster for this. I don‚Äôt want to go into detail in case it makes me identifiable somehow, but we didn‚Äôt hurt anyone or do anything immoral. What we did is not even illegal in the country where I currently live, and our beliefs were far from extremist.)

I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to Daria since the day I got arrested. My best friend died shortly after, and Daria left the country, partly due to the possibility that she‚Äôd be arrested too. There wasn‚Äôt any way for her to contact me while I was in prison, though apparently she contacted my dad a few times in the beginning.

Things got even worse in our country while I was incarcerated, so my dad and I emigrated when I was released. We‚Äôve been living in Western Europe ever since, and life is pretty okay. I live with my dad, and I have a steady (if shitty) job.

Months ago, I found Daria online. She lives in a neighbouring country, seven hours away by rail. She doesn‚Äôt use social media too much, but from what I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs no evidence of a partner or kids. And even if she‚Äôs married, I‚Äôd be content just to be her friend, as I was for the first years we knew each other.

Part of me desperately wants to reach out to her, and my dad has been encouraging me to do so, but I feel like it‚Äôd be too selfish. The circumstances of her brother‚Äôs death were very traumatic for her and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm just a living reminder of all the bad things that happened to us. And if she does have a partner, would my contacting her offend him and trouble their relationship? I don‚Äôt want to cause her any more sadness.

Time stood still for me while I was in prison, but I know it didn‚Äôt for her or anyone else. She‚Äôs done so well for herself, she‚Äôs built a whole life, and I don‚Äôt want to derail that life just because I feel entitled to a place in it. She might not even remember me at all. And even if she did invite me back into her life, I‚Äôd be nothing but a burden now, owing to my wrecked mental health. We‚Äôve been apart twice as long as I knew her. Have I even the right to miss her as much as I do?

For now I‚Äôve contented myself with googling her name every so often and seeing that she‚Äôs okay. It just hurts a lot, and I don‚Äôt know how to make it not hurt. I still love her with everything I have. I probably always will.

Should I reach out to her, or leave her alone? If I do contact her, what should I even say?

TLDR: Unsure whether I should contact my old girlfriend now that I‚Äôm free from prison.

[**(Update) 1 (35m) was incarcerated and lost touch with (33f). I contacted her, and she responded.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10lqf48/update_i_35m_was_incarcerated_and_lost_touch_with/) - Jan 26, 2023 

The short version is that I was wondering whether I should try to contact my former girlfriend after I went to prison for a long time. The consensus was that I should, and people gave very good advice on how to do that.

First, I want to say thank you to everyone who offered advice or kind words. I had spent so long feeling ashamed about my situation, and expecting most people to react very negatively if they knew. I had barely discussed it with anyone before, except my dad and people whose job it is to help me (lawyers, therapist, etc.), and I was very surprised to be met with so much compassion from a bunch of complete strangers. Thank you, truly. Several people asked for an update, and that‚Äôs the least I can do in return.

I sent Daria a message the evening after I made my post. It was something like: ¬´I don‚Äôt mean to intrude, but I wanted to say hello and thought I would give you my new contact information in case you ever felt like getting in touch. If not, that‚Äôs completely fine too.¬ª I left her my mobile number and email address, wished her well, and that was that. I knew it might be a while before she responded, if she responded at all. So I tried to put it out of my mind.

Early monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number from the country where Daria lives. Who else would ever be calling me from there? I panicked a little bit, but I managed to answer in time.

She asked a few times if it was really me, and I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was laughing or crying. At first she called me by the very affectionate version of my name she used to. But then she quickly apologised and corrected herself, which broke my heart a little bit. It was an awkward phone call, but not in a bad way. I was extremely nervous, and it seemed like she was too. But happy, also.

Some of you mentioned that Daria would want to know that I was safe, and this was more true than I could have guessed. Because unrest in my country increased a lot during the last year I was in prison, she was afraid that they would decide to quietly kill me rather than let me go. There are documented cases of other prisoners like me having met very suspicious ends in the months before my release, so it wasn‚Äôt a totally unreasonable worry.

She also said she repeatedly tried to send me parcels of supplies and put money on my commissary account, but her attempts were rejected without explanation. After my sentencing, I was not allowed to receive correspondence or to have a commissary account at all, because of the classification of my crimes, so she was forced to give up. She told me this as an apology, as if I would have been disappointed with her for not helping me more. I had no idea she had done any of that. I do know that it was not a safe thing for her to do, and I feel terrible that she put herself at risk trying to make me a little more comfortable.

She didn‚Äôt seem to want to talk about what happened any more than that, and so we didn‚Äôt. We changed the subject to more lighthearted things: our jobs, the cities where we live, how my dad is adapting to a new country, etc. When she arrived at work and had to end the phone call, she asked if I wanted to continue talking through a messaging app. Obviously I said yes, and downloaded it immediately. We sent messages throughout the day, and she even interrupted her commute home to send me a picture of a restaurant modelled after one of my favourite books, just because she thought I would like it. She told me that she thought of me every time she saw it, but unfortunately the restaurant itself was not so good. I was afraid she wouldn‚Äôt remember me, but she even remembers the things I liked to read? She remembers a lot of little things, even stuff I forgot.

We have been sending messages back and forth ever since, and talking on the phone after I finish work at night, until she gets too sleepy. Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm 24 and she‚Äôs texting me from a few blocks away, as if the next thing she might ask is what‚Äôs for dinner. Other times it seems like we‚Äôre trying to will dead versions of ourselves back to life in order to avoid acknowledging what we‚Äôve lost. She seems a lot more timid than she used to, more passive, which I suppose makes sense. Sometimes I worry about how much I‚Äôve changed, and that maybe she won‚Äôt find anything left in me that‚Äôs worthy of her. But if I could express in words what it feels like to hear her laugh, I could explain that there‚Äôs also a lot that we know very well. She hasn‚Äôt lost her kindness, or her warmth, or her empathy. She still cares about me, and I still care about her. I know that rebuilding a friendship after all that‚Äôs happened will take lots of patience, and I have plenty to spare. I‚Äôm just happy to have the chance to get to know her again.

This morning, Daria asked if I want to have a video call sometime this weekend. I agreed, but I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that as much as I want to see her, I‚Äôm very nervous. I look so different than she would remember. My jaw is messed up, and I have the teeth of a hockey player. (Fortunately, I will qualify for healthcare insurance soon and be able to have it fixed.) I lost weight that I haven‚Äôt put back on, and I see an old man in the mirror. I‚Äôm also worried that I will get very emotional when I see her, and embarrass myself that way. I don‚Äôt really cry in front of people. I‚Äôm not used to it, and this doesn‚Äôt seem like a good occasion to start. Aside from not wanting to appear pitiful, I don‚Äôt want her to feel forced to comfort me. If anyone has some advice on how to handle this, it would be much appreciated.

Overall, this week could not have gone better, and I am extremely grateful to everyone who gave me the little push of courage I needed to send her that message. A thousand times, thank you.

TL;DR: I sent a message to my former partner, she was thrilled to receive it, and we have been happily getting to know each other once again.

Edit: Just to clarify, she doesn‚Äôt have a husband or kids. As I said in my first post, I only considered contacting her because there was no evidence of a partner on her social media. But I understand that my first post wasn‚Äôt visible for a while, so I can see why that may not have been obvious. Sorry for the confusion.

[**Update 2**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA9478385939/comments/11zg9al/update_2/) - Mar 23, 2023

I‚Äôve had a lot of people ask for an update, so here it is. The last two months have gone by very fast.

I told Daria that I was nervous about the video call, and she insisted on having it right away so that I could get it over with and stop worrying. Seeing her made everything feel real in a way it hadn‚Äôt before.

She still looks like herself, or even more beautiful, different only in the sense that she is fully an adult now. The place she lives is very different from our home country, with a distinct culture to which she has assimilated. That she had time to adapt and feel completely at home in this place broke the illusion that no time had passed. In hindsight, that was probably the real reason I had been so nervous‚Äîbecause I could no longer occasionally forget myself and pretend that nothing had changed. The hardest part was not being able to reach through the screen and put my arms around her. Sitting there and watching someone you love cry, from a distance, is not easy. I barely noticed that I was crying too.

She didn‚Äôt seem surprised at my appearance, but she did eventually look me over and ask if the food was shit where I lived. I explained about my jaw, and that I‚Äôm getting it fixed (less dental work is required than I thought, but I need a surgery). Her response was to ask for my address and order groceries to be delivered, including a lot of soft snacks that are easy to eat, and these meal substitution drinks that are actually tasty. She‚Äôs sent them every week since, even though I tell her it‚Äôs not necessary. When I wanted to pay her back, she laughed at me and said she owed me a lot of food, because I had kept her from starving to death in university. I loved being able to cook for her, and I suppose it makes her just as happy to feed me now.

We talk every day, and have made video calls a regular habit. It does me so much good just to see her face, and the awkwardness is mostly gone now. It‚Äôs easy to talk to her. Last night, she brought her computer into the kitchen and talked to me while doing the washing up. It‚Äôs amazing how mundane things like that can make me feel normal, and at home, in ways I forgot I could. I never thought I‚Äôd be that stupidly happy to see someone washing coffee cups. I‚Äôm beginning to think that the idea of home as a physical place is a misconception.

She likes to send photos, to show me where she lives, what her life is like now. She was curious about how things are the same or different here. I didn‚Äôt want to admit that I don‚Äôt have much of a life to share back. Going places just didn‚Äôt seem worth the effort. She is, though.

At first it was very small things. She would send a picture of a pastry she‚Äôd bought at a cafe, saying that she thinks her city has better pastries than mine. I would go out and get one so I could send her a photo too. Then it was beer, which city has better parks, interesting architecture, a department store, and so on. I figured out quickly that she was trying to coax me into going out more, but I played along to make her happy. I‚Äôve seen more of my city in the past month than the entire time I‚Äôve lived here before. I‚Äôve been to the art museum, and finally joined my colleagues for a beer. Usually, I go places for short durations at the less crowded times, but I‚Äôm still going, which is something.

Daria used to be very sociable, so I thought that whatever happened, at least she wouldn‚Äôt be lonely. I was wrong. There is a lot she could never tell her friends, because they can‚Äôt relate. They would feel sorry for her and cease to be equals, she says. Our experiences are different, but we are more able to understand each other than other people could. And despite her own burden, she has quietly picked up half the weight from my shoulders without ever being asked to. I am in awe of her, simply for being the kind of person who would.

For women‚Äôs day I sent her some orchids, and she was very happy that I remembered her favourite flower. The things I can do to make her smile are so small, and she deserves so much more than I know how to give her. But I would do anything for this woman, and I am learning.

There are protests happening where she is, with riot police and tear gas. Whenever this happens, she feels nervous and has difficulty sleeping. Now, at least, I can stay on the phone with her at night so she‚Äôs not alone. Aside from the anxiety, there is also a sense of nostalgia. She talks about when that was us, making noise in the street. I‚Äôm glad she has good memories too, and doesn‚Äôt have to be alone with them anymore.

Finally, the reason I am updating now: she is coming to visit. We were talking last night and I mentioned that a church near me has special windows designed by an artist she loves, and I was thinking about going to see them eventually. She said it would be unfair of me to go without her, so I invited her to come with me. And then somehow it turned from vague future plans to being scheduled for next saturday. She was going to come for the day, but I told her it was silly to travel so far to stay for such a short time, and suggested she stay the entire weekend. So she will be here from friday until sunday. I haven‚Äôt really had time to be nervous yet, but I‚Äôm sure I will.

Thank you again to everyone who has given advice or encouragement. It is very much appreciated.

Neither of us have much secure, healthy relationship experience. Lately, I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm potentially codependent with him, and I‚Äôm feeling an aversion towards him, and wondering if we should keep going or not. I haven‚Äôt talked about any of this, but I‚Äôm about to burst. 

1. He‚Äôs very willing to let me pay when we go out to eat. I should stop offering - idk why but I find reasons to believe I owe him, and he doesn‚Äôt protest at all. Sometimes, when we‚Äôre at a checkout getting coffee or something, he stands close to me but just behind me, and the person at the register assumes we‚Äôre paying together. I wish he would have some distance, because it‚Äôs on me to make it clear we‚Äôre paying separately (which I don‚Äôt say). 

2. I make 60k, he makes 40k. We both have master‚Äôs degrees. Neither of us have lucrative fields, but his is more narrow, and he has a lot of student loan debt. I‚Äôm undecided on kids, but I worry about becoming the primary breadwinner. Neither of us have savings either. I hate to depend on a man, but I feel like I‚Äôll need to if I want kids. 

3. He has a mushy, somewhat clingy demeanor. Combined with 1 & 2 above, I feel like I‚Äôm in a mothering role. Every week he acts exhausted by work, and like he needs me to restore him, but I think he should stop volunteering extra hours he isn‚Äôt paid for, and maybe get a second job with that time instead. He gets antsy when I only see him once a week. He also doesn‚Äôt have much of a social life besides me. 

He has a lot of great qualities though. I wonder if I should talk about all (some) of this with him? Should we go back to just dating or open the relationship? I feel like we got committed too fast.

I love him in a way that he is part of me, part of my life and everything, but I am not in love with him anymore. I know that marriages have their ups and downs, but this year I have realised that I am not happy and that it is very unlikely that I can become happy with him.
I feel so emotionally alone/neglected. I know that he loves me in his way and shows it in daily things like making my coffee for work etc. But even after 20 years he has never learnt to let me in. I have no idea about his feelings in any way and he cannot deal with my emotions. There is no asking about my emotions, there is no comfort, no passion. We do not fight, because he doesn't speak about emotions. Whenever something bothers me, I voice it, but he doesn't comment on it, changes anything about it or anything.
For the past years I had been the only breadwinner which was a tough time starting my own business etc while he was finishing his bachelor degree. In that time he kept lying to me about his progress. For example I only heard from others that he had asked for prolongation the day after he was supposed to hand it in. That was last year and only this year after he got a job and I finally felt a weight lifted off my shoulders am I starting to realise the scars this break of trust has left.
The other problem is his absolute lack of passion. There is no passion. None in the way of fighting as mentioned above, none sexually and none for my hobbies or even shared hobbies. Now that the kids are getting older and we have two incomes again, I feel like finally planning holidays again as that is a passion of mine, but he'd rather stay home.
The other problem is our sex life. It's not good and it never has been. I have a higher drive which is one problem as I would like more. However the sex isn't good. He's never made me cum and it's over too fast. As in everything mentioned above, conversations never led to any change, as I'm the only one talking about my emotions/needs and wants and there is no reaction.
It was so bad that at the beginning of this year I considered cheating, because I thought I should stay with him, but perhaps at least be able to satisfy one of my needs.

These children are NOT children!,"In hindsight, I should have listened to the alarm bells in my head when eight-year-old Cassie announced she and her cabin mates were going to skip camp activities and play Operation instead.

Then again, I had a lot on my mind. Seven counselors had gone missing‚Äîalong with our head counselor, who was supposed to be taking care of us.

It started out fairly normal. I mean, one or two counselors disappearing wasn‚Äôt so bad, right?

Lily and Joey had been drowning in sexual tension for a while, so no one was surprised when they sneaked into the woods for what I could only guess was the most uncomfortable sex ever. 

But then they didn‚Äôt come back.

Teddy and Yuri went looking for them, and then they, too, disappeared. It was almost like a wild animal was lying in wait for another unsuspecting teenager to cross its path.

With six of us left, I was definitely freaking out.

This wasn‚Äôt what I expected from summer camp. I had considered working at my local Sephora, but my mom had other plans‚Äîand whether I was eighteen years old or not, she was getting her way. 

So, goodbye civilization, and hello Canadian wilderness.

There were fifteen kids queued up in front of me for lunch, and I was struggling to keep that optimistic Camp Redwood smile.

I kept counting the hours since the latest disappearance: Connor. He was supposed to be helping with the emergency generator after the electricity sizzled out.

He was gone an hour later. Whatever was happening to the counselors was accelerating. Would it happen to me?

I had seen so many TV shows and movies set in summer camps where every camper and counselor was doomed to die in the most gruesome ways. Was that going to happen to us?

I tightened my grip on the ladle as I stirred a giant pot of chocolate syrup. 

Watching watery chocolate drip from the edge, I felt nauseous. Of all the summer camps my mom could have sent me to, it had to be the one with vanishing counselors and zero adult authority. 

Which meant we were the authority. Twelve teenagers, who‚Äôd come to relax and babysit a bunch of little kids before college.

We had to put on brave faces and pretend everything was fine‚Äîand that we weren‚Äôt all terrified out of our minds.

Out of the corner of my eye, I glimpsed Harry giving piggybacks to a bunch of little kids. One of them, Eleanor, had her arms wrapped around his neck, squealing. 

Judging by the look on his face, he wanted to stop. It was hard to keep a facade when reality was becoming harder and harder to bear. 

His hat long abandoned, Harry was dripping with sweat, trying to keep up the Camp Redwood grin. But as he galloped around the cabin with Eleanor clinging to him, he looked ready to collapse. I didn‚Äôt blame him.

Entertaining the kids had been Teddy‚Äôs assignment‚Äîand he was who knows where. I had taken over lunch duties for Lily, who had joined the long list of the missing.

Harry was supposed to be joining the search party for the missing counselors, but he‚Äôd ended up as the kids‚Äô personal punching bag.

When I first met him, Harry Carlisle was the kid who sat on the sidelines, offering sarcastic remarks and crude jokes. Now, he‚Äôd been reduced to a playground ride the kids pretended didn‚Äôt have an off switch.

He might have enjoyed the first few rides to lift morale, but now I could see the strain in his eyes. ‚ÄúOw!‚Äù Harry winced as Eleanor‚Äôs fingers poked at his eyes. 

‚ÄúHey! Eleanor, not my eyes!‚Äù He was dangerously close to toppling over, but managed to catch his footing, ordering all of them off his back. ‚ÄúHorse rides are over!‚Äù he announced, cupping his hands around his mouth when a group of kids surrounded him, faces alight with mischief. 

Harry backed away, hands up. ‚ÄúCome on, guys, my back isn‚Äôt built for all of you!‚Äù

‚ÄúHorsey!‚Äù the kids shouted back in a cacophony of giggles.

It was ten against one.

Against two, if I got involved. Which wasn‚Äôt going to happen. There was no way I was play-fighting a bunch of eight-year-olds. Harry shot me a hopeful look, but I pretended not to see, busying myself with slightly burned nuggets.

Harry ran his fingers through thick strands of sandy-colored hair and grimaced when a little girl, Phoebe, stepped forward.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Harry shook his head, squeezing the front of his counselor shirt practically glued to him. The temperature hadn‚Äôt let up, even though it was almost 8PM. 

Nighttime, I thought dizzily. 

It was almost bedtime, and still no adults. ‚ÄúI refuse to surrender,‚Äù he told her. 

‚ÄúPhoebe, I‚Äôm not joking around when I say my back is hurting. We‚Äôve been playing horsey for two hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo!‚Äù Harry couldn‚Äôt yell, hiss, or swear at them. That was a big no-no with kids.

However, I could see he was close to breaking that rule. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm tired,‚Äù he said, forcing a Camp Redwood grin that was quickly twitching into a grimace.

I think we‚Äôd all given up on fake enthusiasm after the disappearances started. Now, we were just shells of our former happy selves. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ did you know that if you ride a horsey at this time, the ghosts will come and get you?‚Äù

When a boy‚Äôs eyes widened with fright, Harry realized his mistake.

‚ÄúI mean, the nice ghosts! Yeah! The, uh, nice ghosts who haunt‚Ä¶ I mean play in these woods. It‚Äôs a well-known Camp Redwood legend that ghosts don‚Äôt like horse rides. In fact‚Ä¶‚Äù His lips curved into a devilish smile as he held the kids‚Äô attention. They dropped onto the ground, hands clasped in their laps. It was the quietest they‚Äôd been all day. I understood. 

Harry had taken over ghost stories at the campfire for three nights in a row, and he was a damn good storyteller.

With every eye on him, Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. ‚ÄúDo you guys want to know what they do?‚Äù

The kids nodded, eyes wide.

‚ÄúThey sneak into unsuspecting cabins‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry.‚Äù

Rowan‚Äôs voice sounded from outside in a warning. The window was open, and he was standing watch, waiting to see if any counselors came back. Since the only adult had vanished, he‚Äôd taken charge‚Äîand the guy was taking himself a little too seriously.

His warning was valid, though. Harry‚Äôs ghost stories could be a bit too much for the younger kids, who had wild imaginations, especially at night. 

Olive, my cabin-mate, had given up her bed for a little girl who was convinced Harry‚Äôs ‚Äútree boy‚Äù was going to sneak into her bed and turn her into an apple seed.

‚ÄúDid I say sneak into cabins? I meant dance around the woods‚Ä¶‚Äù Harry corrected himself. ‚ÄúAnd they look for their next unsuspecting victim‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry!‚Äù

‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù Harry swallowed his words when a little boy‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúI mean, they‚Äôre looking for a friend! So, the point of my story is‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHorsey rides get us new friends?‚Äù Phoebe wasn‚Äôt buying it, judging by her arched brow and widening smile.

The girl shook dark curls out of her face, smirking. 

I think it was her pleading eyes that won him over, because, with a sigh, he dropped to his knees and grudgingly told her to climb on his back‚Äîand she did, putting one sparkling shoe on his spine with enough force to send him to his stomach. 

Maybe I was imagining it, but since when were these littles so spiteful?

The little girl was grinning, not because she got to ride her ‚Äúhorsey,‚Äù but because Harry looked ready to either wring her neck or his own. Mom had warned me that, without adult authority, little kids could start to act out.

I could call it ‚Äúacting out,‚Äù but I‚Äôd spent an entire day with her earlier, playing with dolls and having a teddy bear picnic when she admitted she didn‚Äôt want to swim in the lake. Phoebe had been shy and spoke to me through her teddy bear. What had changed?

Could the lack of adults really be scaring the kids that much?

‚ÄúMiss Josie?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, only half-noticing as kids helped themselves, piling chicken nuggets and cookies on plastic plates and hurrying to their seats as if I couldn‚Äôt see them.

Blinking away brain fog, I found myself face-to-face with Eli, who was probably my favorite camper.

You‚Äôre not supposed to have personal preferences when working with little kids because your opinions could upset them.

However, it was incredibly hard not to like Eli.

Hiding behind a mop of brown curls, Eli was one of the more vocal kids in the group. He said he wanted to be an inventor when he was older, and he wanted to make robots. The kid had even asked me if I wanted to see his robot collection, but I was too busy setting up camp activities. Standing in front of me and clutching his tray, Eli was frowning.

‚ÄúJosie, I just saw some kids steal chicken nuggets.‚Äù

I shrugged, shoveling a large portion onto his tray. ‚ÄúWell, you can have some extra too.‚Äù

Eli‚Äôs smile wasn‚Äôt as big as usual. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Teddy?‚Äù

I pretended to be oblivious, hastily adding more nuggets to his tray as if I could keep his mouth shut with extra food. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be back soon! Teddy is just playing in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù

At first, I thought I‚Äôd heard him wrong. Eli wasn‚Äôt looking at me, instead counting his nuggets as usual with the prongs of his plastic fork.

I leaned forward with my best smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what was that, Eli?‚Äù

He lifted his head with a wide grin. ‚ÄúCan I borrow a knife, Josie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you need a knife?‚Äù

Leaning forward, the boy shrugged. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a squirrel caught in a trap,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to put it out of its misery, Miss Josie. It‚Äôs in a lot of pain.‚Äù

That was‚Ä¶ dark.

‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt give you a knife‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, my gaze finding Harry and the growing line of kids waiting for a horse ride. 

‚ÄúBut! How about you go ask Harry for a piggy-back ride?‚Äù I pointed to myself with a forced grin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save the squirrel!‚Äù 

When Eli‚Äôs eyes filled with tears and he shook his head, I reached out, grasping his hand, and squeezed it as tight as I could. ‚ÄúEli, we don‚Äôt need to do that, okay? I‚Äôm sure the squirrel can be saved, and I‚Äôll make sure to take it to the vet, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if it doesn‚Äôt need saving?‚Äù

I squeezed tighter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save it, Eli. I promise.‚Äù

Eli didn‚Äôt look convinced, but he nodded with a grumble. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said, before twisting around and joining the other kids torturing Harry. Immediately, I left my station‚Äîwhether Rowan liked it or not‚Äîand headed outside to look for this supposedly dying squirrel. That was something we didn‚Äôt need.

The sky was darkening when I made it into the woods, cotton-candy clouds blurring through the thick canopy of trees. Eli had said it was near the sign pointing toward the lake. But I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Odd. 

That thought retracted in my head, however, when I stepped forward, and a squelching sound cut through the silence of my heavy breaths mixing with insect chirping and nightlife buzzing above and below me. The wet squelch twisted my gut, and when I stared down at the ground, I didn‚Äôt know what I was expecting.

A squashed squirrel, perhaps? 

In Eli‚Äôs words, the poor thing had been on the edge of death. Though, when I thought about it, there were no animal traps around camp. That was basic health and safety. So, what the heck was I looking at? 

The bottom of my shoe was caked in dried blood, but it was the thing stamped into the dirt that sent my heart into my throat. 

It looked like‚Ä¶ an eye.

But looking closer as I lowered myself to the ground, I glimpsed something metallic, something glistening around the pupil. I picked up a stick and prodded it, though the thing didn‚Äôt move. It was definitely an eye‚Äîthe eye of some kind of animal, judging from the pigmentation and the color of the iris.

But it was the metallic pieces around the eye that threw me off. Part of a trap, maybe? It wouldn‚Äôt be out of the realm of possibility that a poor critter had been ripped apart, and a wild bear had dropped its dinner near the camp‚Äîand the metal encasing its eye was likely pieces of a trap.

Peering closer, though, I glimpsed silver slivers in what appeared to be destroyed nerves caked to my shoe. 

After scraping most of it off, I caught glistening pieces of blood-stained metal catching the late-setting sun. This time, I pinched a piece between my forefinger and thumb. It didn‚Äôt look like a bear trap. 

The metal itself wasn‚Äôt serrated or old. In fact, it was new.

Which begged the question: What was this thing?

Whatever it was, it had started converting what looked like a critter‚Äôs eye before stopping. Was it a virus? When that thought hit me, I fell back with a hiss, swiping my hands on my shirt.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

I almost jumped out of my skin, diving to my feet.

Carmel was standing behind me, grasping what looked like her sixth or seventh coffee. The girl had been running to and from the coffee machine all day, and I had been silently counting her caffeine intake. 

Carmel had been a well-put-together and fairly popular girl when camp started. 

She immediately had everyone following her beck and call, with boys (and girls) trailing after her.

Carmel wasn‚Äôt straight. She made that clear on the bus to camp, announcing she wasn‚Äôt interested in guys and had a girlfriend back home. 

Still, the boys followed her because... well, she was pretty. Carmel was my bunkmate and had woken me up on three separate occasions at 6 a.m. to go through the exact same hair and makeup routine. 

Now, though, there was no sign of makeup or even that she had brushed her hair.

Instead of her usual tidy blonde ponytail, Carmel‚Äôs curls were tied into raggedy pigtails with ribbons I was sure she‚Äôd stolen from a camper‚Äôs doll. I think what was keeping her going was coffee.

Carmel regarded me with too-wide eyes and a Camp Redwood smile we all knew was fake. She was clutching her coffee cup for dear life. ‚ÄúJosie!‚Äù She jumped when I jumped, which almost made me laugh. 

‚ÄúRowan‚Äôs having an emergency meeting in his cabin,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm pretty sure he's also having a meltdown, but that's a him problem!‚Äù Her gaze flicked to the ground. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ *are* you doing?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I considered telling Carmel I may have found what looked like a virus that turned flesh and blood to metal‚Äîbefore I remembered her reaction when a spider had crept into our cabin.

Whatever this thing was, keeping it a secret for now was probably for the best. Making sure I was standing on it, I shrugged. ‚ÄúI was looking for the others.‚Äù

Carmel cocked her head, then rested her coffee on the ground. ‚ÄúIn the dirt?‚Äù

‚ÄúFootprints, Carmel.‚Äù

She looked confused before shaking her head. ‚ÄúOkay, whatever. Tell the others I‚Äôll be there in a sec. I just need to make sure the kids are okay. We‚Äôre putting a movie on for them in the lunch hall, so that‚Äôll hopefully distract them for maybe two hours. I'm thinking of Frozen, or Frozen Two.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúDid anyone find a phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot with signal!‚Äù 

‚ÄúCarmel.‚Äù I had to fight back the urge to yell at her to keep her voice down. Kids were curious, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we had some littles peeking into our conversation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay,‚Äù I said softly.

‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre not okay, because yes, things are very... screwed up right now, but we need to be‚Ä¶ optimistic.‚Äù I exhaled, searching for eyes in the dark. 

I tried to smile, trying to keep up that Camp Redwood fa√ßade we were all held hostage by until the last day of camp. 

(According to rule 5 in the Camp Redwood counselor handbook, all counselors must retain a smile and a positive attitude. 

5. If ANY counselor is caught making a frowny face or spreading what we call ‚Äúunhappiness,‚Äù we will be forced to send the counselor home).

At this point, I didn‚Äôt care‚Äîbut part of me didn‚Äôt want to scare the little kids.

‚ÄúNo, Josie.‚Äù Carmel grabbed my shoulders with a grin rivaling the Joker. ‚ÄúI am so sick of being told to keep smiling, because what is that doing? Three of my cabin-mates are missing! I‚Äôm the only one left, and Rowan and co expect me to keep up this act? We are fucked!""

She cupped her mouth. ‚ÄúF. U. C. K. E. D.‚Äù

I took a step back, keeping hold of her hand. Carmel was trembling, her hands clammy and slick, entangled in mine. ‚ÄúRowan is just trying to keep the kids from freaking out.‚Äù

She groaned, tears glistening in her eyes. ‚ÄúYes, but nothing is okay!‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything IS okay.‚Äù I turned to her with what I hoped was a reassuring smile‚Äîknowing damn well about the thing I‚Äôd found in the dirt. If that thing could spread, it would have a field day in an enclosed space like a summer camp.

I noticed my own hands, which had been touching the thing, making contact with Carmel, and dropped them, inwardly squirming.

If that thing was a virus, I was already fucked.

Maybe Carmel too.

If it was fast-acting, it could explain the counselors' disappearances. 

I was already putting together a plan in my head as we headed back to the main cabin. 

We had to put together a search party. Some of us would stay with the kids, while a small group would venture into the woods to try and look for traces of the missing. If I was right, we would find a horror scene in the woods, and yes, that would be the time to panic.

If I was wrong, however, there was still hope.

‚ÄúAre we going to be okay?‚Äù

Carmel‚Äôs voice sliced into my thoughts, and I took a moment to drink in the camp around us.

Usually, when the sky turned twilight, it would be bustling with campers and counselors toasting marshmallows on the fire and gathering around to fall asleep to Harry‚Äôs ghost stories. 

Carmel would be kneeling with a bunch of kids, watching a YouTube video they had all insisted on her watching, while Rowan would be hiding behind his book with his knees to his chest, his gaze glued to every page he flipped through, ignoring everyone.

Teddy would be making funny faces for kids who were scared, and Connor would be handing out plates of burgers. 

I remembered feeling safe and at home, cozy around the flickering orange of the fire as chatter turned to laughter and white noise in my head. After the kids went back to their cabins, the group of us would resume our positions around the fire, but this time it was more‚Ä¶ intimate. 

With Allison in her cabin, we kind of ignored her rules altogether.

Making out happened, because of course it did. 

Beers stolen from Allison‚Äôs mini fridge and raging hormones, as well as late-night skinny dipping in the lake did that. 

Couples went off into the woods, and we all felt completely comfortable and at home with each other.

Looking around at that moment, I felt sick to my stomach. That feeling was gone.

The feeling of family, familiarity, and friendship. What I was looking at now was that same log we had all sat on, now turned on its side‚Äîhot dog buns and candy wrappers littering the ground. It was a ghost camp.

I could still see Connor‚Äôs jacket slung on the ground and Lili‚Äôs bright pink Ray-Bans sitting on a beer can. Because there were no adults to yell at us to clean up after ourselves. I was frowning at the skeleton of the fire when Carmel nudged me. 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Her voice was shaking. ‚ÄúJosie? You didn‚Äôt answer my question.‚Äù 

Carmel wanted me to be the voice of reason, and I wasn‚Äôt that. I was just as scared as she was.

There was only so much I could sugarcoat, and I gave up doing that after the third counselor disappeared. All I could offer her was forced optimism.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust keep the kids busy, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

When I twisted around and power-walked to Rowan‚Äôs cabin, I shouted over my shoulder, ‚ÄúGive them some of those animal crackers!‚Äù

Carmel shouted back, ‚ÄúWait, *what* animal crackers?‚Äù

I turned to elaborate, but she was gone.

When I finally got to Rowan‚Äôs cabin, I was sweating through my shirt and had an idea of what I was going to tell the others. 

It was‚Ä¶ a thing, which could be considered a disease or a virus‚Äîso it was vital that we split into two groups: half of us would search for the others, while the rest would look for anything to get in contact with the outside world‚Äîan emergency landline, laptop, or cell phone.

I did have one problem: lack of evidence. All that was left from the thing I‚Äôd found was stuck to my foot. The rest of it was buried in the dirt. It was too dark to search for it, and we would be wasting time doing so.

All of that was on my mind and tangled on my tongue, one single string of incomprehensible gibberish I wasn‚Äôt even sure was English, when I stepped into Rowan‚Äôs cabin, where four sets of eyes met mine.

Olive was cross-legged on the floor with her arms folded, Harry was pacing up and down with a brand new bruise blooming under his eye, courtesy of Eleanor almost poking his eyes out‚Äîand Rowan himself was sitting on the top bunk, his legs swinging off the side.

The guy wasn‚Äôt built to be our leader, originally being the laziest of our group, opting to sit in a tree with a book rather than help set up camp activities. 

Yet he had become our default guy in charge because he so happened to be wearing the head counselor hat when Allison disappeared. 

Admittedly, it suited him; the bright red of the cap contrasted with his dark curls under a late-setting sun through the back window, setting strands of straying hair on fire.

The hat was a little too big for his head, though, slipping over his eyes.

Rowan looked like a divorced father of two, dark circles bruising his eyes, and a very ‚Äúdad-like‚Äù scowl curling on his lips.

With a clipboard pressed to his chest and a pen he was chewing on, the boy resembled a grown man who had just caught his daughter coming in after curfew. ‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù Spitting the pen‚Äôs lid out of his mouth, he scribbled something down. 

I had no doubt he was tracking my attendance for these stupid crisis meetings. His eyes were wild, scanning me for answers. ‚ÄúI should have known.‚Äù

I raised my brow. ‚ÄúShould have known *what*?‚Äù

Rowan scribbled something else. ‚ÄúThat you would be the last to join us.‚Äù

I threw my hands up, exasperated. ‚ÄúWe're in a *crisis*. 

‚ÄúYou're still late.‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúWhere the fuck is Carmel?‚Äù

I shut the door behind me, leaning against it with my arms folded. ‚ÄúSo, we can swear now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Rowan rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThere are no kids here, so go crazy.‚Äù He pointed at me with the pen. ‚ÄúCarmel. Where is she?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeeping the kids busy,‚Äù Callan‚Äôs muffled voice came from the bottom bunk. 

I could barely see the guy lying on his stomach, his face stuffed into a pillow. 

‚ÄúIt was my idea to play Shrek for them, but the little shits said they haven‚Äôt seen it,‚Äù the boy lifted his head, his lips carved into a scowl. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, am I tripping? Everyone‚Äôs seen Shrek! Do these kids expect the Minecraft movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like that, either,‚Äù Harry stopped pacing the cabin. ‚ÄúEleanor looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if she liked it.""

‚ÄúFortnite, too,‚Äù Olive said, a cushion pressed to her chest. ‚ÄúI suggested playing it a few days ago, and like, zero kids knew what it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúSix counselors are missing,‚Äù Rowan raised his voice over the others' chatter. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre questioning what games they like?‚Äù His eyes found mine once more. ‚ÄúSo, Carmel is with the kids? You‚Äôre absolutely sure of it?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. I mean, I just saw her five minutes ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Rowan said sarcastically. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt go missing under mysterious circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Olive shot him a glare, throwing a cushion in his face. ‚ÄúI told you. They‚Äôre probably lost‚Äîor maybe they went to get help?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been trained to know every inch of these woods,‚Äù Rowan catapulted the cushion right back at her. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, where are they?!‚Äù Callan sat up, bringing his knees to his chest. I had never seen the guy look this vulnerable. 

‚ÄúAllison made sense. She probably had other duties and left us to look after the kids. But six counselors? All of them disappearing‚Äîour phone signal completely cutting out, electricity cutting off, not once, but twice? What is even sucking all of our power?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got the emergency generator working,‚Äù Olive raised her arm. ‚ÄúConnor and I managed it before‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off.

‚ÄúBefore Connor disappeared,‚Äù Callan finished for her. ‚ÄúAnd before him, it was Joey, Lily, Mira, Yuri, Noah, and Teddy. Which isn‚Äôt a fucking coincidence.‚Äù He shot Rowan a look, who glared down at his lap. 

I could tell the boy didn‚Äôt want to lead all of us, come up with plans, and answer the questions we desperately needed answered. 

His job was to look after us, as well as the littles, and so far, he was doing a pretty good job. I could tell by his expression that he thought the opposite, but he had managed to keep the kids from finding out about something as sinister as someone actively kidnapping counselors.

He made sure they were fed, entertained, and safe, watching a movie‚Äîwhile we were scared for our lives. Rowan was keeping up the fa√ßade, no matter how scared he was. The boy dropped his head into his lap with a sigh. It looked like he might fall asleep before he slammed the clipboard into his face to wake himself up.

Nobody wanted to admit what Callan was saying, but we were all definitely thinking it. ‚ÄúThis was planned,‚Äù Callan continued.

‚ÄúSomeone out here is fucking with us, very clearly trying to freak us out. Now they've got six of us.‚Äù He spread his arms. ‚ÄúHow long until one of the littles gets taken, huh? A bunch of eighteen-year-olds aren‚Äôt going to satisfy them, so what about when they start taking campers? We are in the middle of fuckin‚Äô nowhere with a serial kidnapper on the loose, and did we really just leave fifteen kids in the care of a girl who thought Australia was in England?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Carmel‚Äôs defense, she was black-out drunk when she said that,‚Äù Olive murmured.

‚ÄúVoice down!‚Äù Rowan hissed. ‚ÄúDo you want to scare them?!‚Äù His gaze flicked to me. ‚ÄúDid you do a headcount during dinner?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúFifteen kids all accounted for. Ten are in the lunch hall, and five girls are in Cassie‚Äôs cabin playing Operation.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll day?‚Äù Olive spoke up. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt they playing that this morning? I tried to get into their cabin to give them breakfast, but they just shooed me away and locked the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù Rowan ran his fingers down his face. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll go see what‚Äôs going on with them. Knowing Cassie and her friends, they‚Äôre probably zonked out on stolen candy. When all of the kids are accounted for in the lunch cabin, we gather outside.‚Äù

I swallowed, speaking up. ‚ÄúI actually wanted to talk to you guys about something.‚Äù

Rowan lifted his head, jutting the edge of the clipboard into his chin. ‚ÄúGo on‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI found something?‚Äù I pulled a face. ‚ÄúI mean, I think I‚Äôve found something?‚Äù

I wasn't sure how to explain to a dwindling group of exhausted teenagers that there may be something even more terrifying than potential kidnappers out there. Four blank faces stared back at me, and Rowan leaned forward with a frown. ‚ÄúLike, in general? Josie, we don‚Äôt have time to go foraging.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could call it a lead,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I need your eyes to find it.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh. But what is it?‚Äù

Thinking back to what exactly I had seen, I had no idea how to describe it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better if I just‚Ä¶ showed you.‚Äù

Rowan looked skeptical but nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. Josie comes with me. We‚Äôll check out Allison‚Äôs cabin again to look for an emergency line, and you can show me whatever this ‚Äòthing‚Äô is you‚Äôve found. 
Then we‚Äôll escort Cassie and the other girls to the lunch cabin. Every camper needs an escort from now on. The rest of you? Act normal. If the kids see you freaking out, they will also freak out‚Äîand we need to keep up morale.‚Äù

The boy pointed to Olive. 

‚ÄúOlive, you sit in with the kids and look after them. Callan, check out the emergency generator. Harry, the kids see you as a playground ride, so use that to your advantage. Offer them horse rides if they‚Äôre scared. And stop with the ghost stories; it‚Äôs making it worse. Give them piggybacks.‚Äù

Harry rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúDo I have a choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Rowan cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWe all keep up appearances. If the others turn up after getting high or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, having an orgy in the woods‚Äî I will fucking *kill* them.‚Äù 

The way he smiled through his teeth, jumping off the bunk, his toes primed like a wild animal, I knew he wasn‚Äôt joking. 

If this was a well-constructed prank the other counselors were playing, I had no doubt Rowan would rip them apart for leaving him as a reluctant leader. 

To my surprise, the others wandered off with their tasks.

I watched Rowan lift up his pillow and pull out a pack of animal crackers, ripping open the bag and pouring the contents into his mouth. He caught my eye, crunching through mini animal crackers. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have lunch,‚Äù he said through a mouthful.

I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a sense of relief as we headed across camp, Rowan in front of me while I lagged behind.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù I caught up to him, almost tripping over a log.

The guy didn‚Äôt turn around. ‚ÄúI am completely winging it,‚Äù he said through a choked laugh. ‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, and if I‚Äôm honest? I just want to go home, dude. I haven‚Äôt looked after this many kids in my life, and if I have to smile one more time at a little brat, I am going to fucking lose my mind.‚Äù He heaved out a breath. ‚ÄúI am making this up as I go along.‚Äù

I laughed that time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ comforting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù He turned to shoot me a grin. ‚ÄúWell, rest assured I am just about as scared‚Äîif not more scared than you.‚Äù As we stopped in front of Cassie‚Äôs cabin, his gaze found mine. ‚ÄúIs it me‚Ä¶‚Äù he said softly, ‚Äúor does the lunch cabin seem quiet?‚Äù

He was right. The windows were dark when they should have been illuminated by the TV screen. Instead of answering, I stepped in front of him, grasping hold of the cabin door. ‚ÄúCassie?‚Äù I knocked three times. ‚ÄúGirls, are you okay in there? It‚Äôs Josie and Rowan.‚Äù I tried the door, and it slid open. Shooting a look at the boy behind me, I turned back to the door.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù

Cassie squeaked from inside. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not finished!‚Äù

Ignoring the coil of dread unraveling in my gut, I forced the door open and stepped into unusually milky white light, which flooded the cabin. The first thing I saw was eight-year-old Cassie, sitting cross-legged with her back to me. She was sitting in a circle with the other girls, no doubt playing their game.

When I stepped closer, however, I noticed something pooling across the wooden floor. It must have been juice or water that they had spilled. I took another step, but this time, clammy fingers wrapped around my wrist and yanked me back. Rowan didn't speak, but his eyes were elsewhere. 

Initially, they had been drinking in the cabin before they found oblivion entirely. I heard his breath start to accelerate, his grip tightening on my wrist.

I had half a mind to pull away before I saw the body-shaped carcass the girls were sitting around. In the dim light of the cabin, it used to be a person‚ÄîTeddy. I could still see parts of an identity:

Freckled cheeks and eyes that were still open, still staring at the sky. 

But that was where the similarities to the missing counselor ended. 

The thing that used to be Teddy was more of a shell, a scooped-out thing resembling a human body. What sent me stumbling backward, my mouth open in a silent scream, was the almost surgical efficiency of each organ's removal, like it really was a game of Operation. 

His heart, lungs, and intestines were in one pile‚Äîwhile his brain was cupped between little Cassie's bloody hands.

And when my gaze found the little girl, Nina, hiding behind dark curly hair, I saw what looked like a toy robot‚Äôs head in her hands. 

In my head, I was thinking about the eye with the metallic pieces glittering around its pupil, and something turned in my gut.

Did I find a human eye? 

I was staring at the crevice inside the boy's skull and the boxes of surgical equipment piled on the girl's bunks when Rowan finally pulled me back, and I stumbled straight onto my ass. There was no brain, just the pearly white of the guy‚Äôs skull. 

""We need to go,"" Rowan croaked. 

Cassie‚Äôs words rattled in my head. 

Teddy, I thought. Teddy wasn‚Äôt finished.

""Josie. Get up. Now!"" My head was spinning, and I was sure I‚Äôd thrown up. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize we had managed to stumble from the girl‚Äôs cabin before cool air grazed my face, tickling my cheeks. 

Something wet, warm, and lumpy was spattering the front of my shirt.

Before I could muster any words, the boy was pulling me to my feet, and I saw stars in my eyes, blinking brightly. When the two of us started forward in a run, Rowan stopped abruptly. I followed his gaze to find several kids surrounding his cabin, where Harry, Olive, and Callan were. 

Maybe I was hallucinating, but Eleanor and Phoebe‚Äîboth wielding weapons I had no idea where they got‚Äîlooked‚Ä¶ taller? 

Rowan didn‚Äôt waste time, dragging me back. 

‚ÄúAllison‚Äôs cabin,‚Äù he said, his voice rising to a cry that became a sob, pulling me across the camp and stumbling over the rocky ground. ‚ÄúWe need a phone. Fuck, we need a phone. We need a fucking phone or I'm going to go insane, or maybe I am insane! Maybe I'm going fucking crazy!‚Äù Rowan struggled to stand, occasionally bending over and choking on dust. ‚ÄúThey were playing Operation.‚Äù Rowan whispered in a hysterical giggle, which wasn‚Äôt like him. 

‚ÄúWith Teddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre just kids!‚Äù I choked out.

Little kids who had surgically removed every organ inside Teddy‚Äôs body.

Little kids who were hunting the other counselors down and would surely be coming for us.

Allison‚Äôs cabin was thankfully further into the woods. 

When we were safe inside and Rowan was locking the door, I dry heaved several times, unable to shake the image of glistening gore splattering the cabin floor from my mind. ‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù Rowan was already tearing apart the cabin. 

‚ÄúWork with me here, okay? We don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have fucking time to freak out or to barf‚Äîwe need to get help. Now. Because this isn't normal.‚Äù His voice went strangely sing-song. ‚ÄúThiisss is not normal, this isn't *happening*.‚Äù Rowan was freaking out, and when he hit the ground on his knees, I took over. I searched Allison‚Äôs desk first.

Nothing of importance‚Äîjust documents and invoices. Digging through her drawer, there was still nothing. We were running out of time.

Abandoning the desk, I went through her suitcase and bags. 

When I crawled under her bed to try and find a weapon, Rowan hissed, ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù When I turned to him, he was still kneeling, but his foot was clamping down on a loose plank. The guy didn‚Äôt hesitate, pulling at the loose plank, which, to my confusion, revealed what looked like a trap door.

Rowan turned to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù

I could only stare at the trap door revealing stone steps. He peered down, his voice echoing. ‚ÄúAllison has a fucking secret bunker?‚Äù

His lips curved into a surprisingly childish grin that took me off guard. ‚ÄúOh, wow, that‚Äôs so cooooool!‚Äù

Lifting my head at the sound of loud squealing, I glimpsed a group of littles led by Eleanor stalking toward us. 

Eleanor had a hostage: Harry. 

And with the way she was sticking the blade of a scary-looking knife to his throat, I figured she meant business. Their height difference was almost comical. The eighteen-year-old guy had to hunch over so the little girl could successfully keep him prisoner. Behind them in the trees, I could see something illuminating the dark: an electric blue light bathing their faces.

So, that was where the power was going.

But what the fuck were these eight-year-olds doing?

‚ÄúJosie!‚Äù Rowan hissed from down below. He had already climbed down.

I joined him, struggling down the stone steps before replacing the loose plank. If these kids were as smart as I thought, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long to realize the loose plank was also a trap door. Allison‚Äôs bunker was more of a control room. There were multiple screens lit up and a chair in front of a working MacBook. The phone line was cut. But that didn‚Äôt make sense.

The kids were unaware of the bunker, so who cut the phone lines? Rowan was on the laptop, struggling to get through the password protection, so I turned my attention to piles of cardboard boxes.

When I opened them, I found myself staring at animal crackers.

There were hundreds of them, packed on top of each other. Looking further, digging through the boxes, I found a piece of old crumpled paper that looked ancient.

**REGARDING PROJECT SPEARHEAD SUBJECTS:**

**PLEASE DO NOT INGEST UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. IF MULTIPLE SUBJECTS INGEST, PLEASE USE SELF-DESTRUCT.**

**ONLY USE IN CASES SUCH AS IMMINENT DESTRUCTION TO THE PLANET/THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR.**

**(PLEASE CONTACT FAMILIES IN ADVANCE. MAKE SURE TO INGEST WITH WATER TO AVOID NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PSYCHOSIS AND EXTREME VIOLENCE. PLEASE APPROACH SUBJECTS WITH CAUTION.)**

Something ice cold slithered down my spine.

Abandoning the boxes, I searched through a cabinet filled with files that were crumbling apart from age. I picked one at random and flicked through it.

Eleanor Summers.

Sex: Female.

DOB: 08/05/1977.

Initially, I thought I was reading the dates wrong. But then, with my heart in my throat, I grasped for other files.

Eli Evermore.

Sex: Male.

DOB: 08/03/1979.

‚ÄúRowan,‚Äù I managed to get out through a breath.

‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not children.‚Äù

The boy rubbed his eyes, frowning. His eyes were half-lidded, almost confused. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIs forty-five years old.‚Äù

He nodded slowly, turning back to the laptop. ‚ÄúHow do you spell‚Ä¶ documents? I‚Äôm looking for digital versions, but I can‚Äôt find any.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how to spell documents?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a hard day,‚Äù the boy whined, tipping his head back and blowing a raspberry. ‚ÄúI'm tired. I wanna go nap.‚Äù

I tried to ignore the visible beads of sweat running down his face. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, you want to go *nap*?‚Äù I hissed.

Rowan did a shoulder shrug. ‚ÄúI'm tired.‚Äù

Whatever I was going to say was choked in the back of my throat when a loud bang sounded from above, the sounds of childish giggling coming through the floorboards. But the laughter didn‚Äôt sound like little kids. No, it sounded like teenagers who were acting like little kids. 

I stared at the boxes of animal crackers and then at the file confirming Eleanor‚Äôs real age. 

My own words shuddered through me, and I remembered finding Teddy‚Äôs dismembered carcass in Cassie‚Äôs cabin. 

When I caught her gaze, the little girl didn‚Äôt look scared, and somehow, her fingers wrapped around the scalpel looked just right.

Like the little bitch knew exactly what she was doing.

‚ÄúHelloooo?‚Äù Harry‚Äôs voice was a hysterical giggle. ‚ÄúOlly, Olly, Oxen freeee!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you in heeeeeeere?‚Äù Carmel joined in. I could hear their footsteps above, dancing across the room.

Clamping my hand over my mouth, I dragged my knees to my chest and prayed they weren‚Äôt smart enough to figure out we were right underneath them.

The worst pet peeve I have is when the cafe is busy and there's a long a** line and people won't think of their order until the last second.
You're telling me you drove or walked on your own volition into a coffee shop, hopped in line, waited ten minutes, and have not once thought about your own drink? And maybe sometimes they'd pull up an app for a competitor.
Be so for real.

1gf4opw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/1gf4opw/postshow_self_examination/,Post-show self examination.,"Sunday evening was the first time I've ever performed my one-man show, ""The Portable Poe Show"" on a precenium arch stage in a real theatre. I've performed before on this stage and the producers are trying to do one-off shows like mine in order to raise money. I'm not sure how much money I made for them. It looked to me like thirty five or forty people in a theatre that seats ninety-six. Ten of those people were my friends and family. If you take away what I was paid, the theatre only made about four hundred dollars. I'm sure I was projecting my own hopes when I imagined a larger audience since Edgar Allan Poe is so-Halloween!  The most exciting thing for me was getting to use real sound effects.  I only had three rehearsals in order to: re-block the show, since it had been originally designed for the classroom or coffee shop, create the light cues, get the sound f/x files from my sound engineer to the TD at the theatre and then get them properly downloaded into their computer. Also, I did not have the stage entirely to myself. Since my show was a one-off, the show they are presently producing got precedence, I had to adjust. Since all that's required for Poe is a black background, it was easy enough to drag black curtains around the set to conceal the bright colors and furnish me with a totally black background.

I call them ""dramatic recitations"". I perform, The Fall of the House of Usher  and The Tell-Tale Heart in the first half and Annabelle Lee and The Raven in the second.

\-The biggest note I have for myself is that I tired by the end of the second half, so I messed up some of the lines in The Raven. I got tired because the show was now more than fifty to sixty percent larger than I've ever done. I covered and pressed on. Otherwise, I remembered all my lines from the text, but I did mess up once or twice with the historical information I have recently written and memorized.

\-Everyone said the sound f/xs worked well and generally meshed with my utterances on stage. We had forest sounds with wind and an occasional wolf crying. The interiors were fires crackling, ethereal murmurs, dragging chains and now and then a muffled scream. For the Tell-Tale Heart the sound background was a loud dripping of water and background whispering as I spoke about how I murdered my flatmate and crammed his dismembered corspe beneath the floorboards of his own bedroom. It thought the f/x was very effective.

\-I was supposed to perform the crazy man in TTH with a dark colored shawl around myself, but I misplaced it during the dark scene change and couldn't use it for my crazy guy to play which was too bad, since I had chosen that piece precisely because it helped me to enhance my character. My wife, my harshest critic, said it went well just the same. 

\-Finally, one reason I was able to pull it off is because of the theatre TD. He had three quick rehearsals on a show he'd never seen before , but he was extremely helpful with the lights and sound and doing it on the fly.

\-The producer saw it for thche first time and said he'd like to get together and talk about the future. They'll probaby have me back next year, but I sense that he might have even bigger plans.

I was a theatre teacher all my life. Now retired, I spend all my time producing my one-man shows and getting gigs. 

If you've read this far I would also like to suggest that more theatres might tailor their offering to work in a classroom or school muti-purpose room in order to sel it to schools. American theatres have been dangerously reduced by the pandemic and modern technology. Wouldn't it be a good direction for theatres to produce more plays for the schools, colleges and universities? School budgets are getting better, slowly. Theatre need to find audiences to pay for their labors. Schools have captive audiences. Teachers love not having to teach, and our young people always need more art in their lives, especially these days.

Thanks for reading. Would love comments!

To motivate your volunteers and make your cookie dough fundraiser even more exciting, consider offering New York pro team game tickets as prizes for the top-selling volunteers. For example, you could offer a pair of tickets to a New York Yankees game at Yankee Stadium, a Brooklyn Nets game at Barclays Center, or a New York Giants game at MetLife Stadium. This is a great way to show your appreciation for your hardworking volunteers and give them a unique and exciting experience.

You could also consider offering additional prizes, such as a pre-game tour of the stadium or a meet-and-greet with a player. To make it even more competitive, you could create a leaderboard to track the top-selling volunteers and offer prizes for different levels of sales. For example, the top-selling volunteer could win a pair of tickets to a Yankees game, while the second-place volunteer wins a pair of tickets to a Nets game. This will not only motivate your volunteers to sell more cookie dough, but also give them a chance to experience the excitement of a live New York pro team game.

**Incentivize Local Businesses with NY Team Apparel**

To encourage local businesses to buy cookie dough in bulk, consider offering a unique incentive that combines the appeal of New York sports teams with the convenience of gifting cookie dough to their best customers or new clients. For example, you could offer a limited edition New York Yankees or Mets t-shirt or hat to businesses that purchase a certain quantity of cookie dough. This not only provides a fun and exclusive incentive for the business owners, but also gives them a creative way to show appreciation to their valued customers and attract new clients.

Imagine the excitement of receiving a fresh batch of cookie dough and a Yankees t-shirt as a thank-you gift from a local business! By partnering with local businesses and offering unique incentives like NY team apparel, you can tap into the local community's passion for sports and build relationships with businesses that can help drive sales and support your school's fundraising efforts.

By implementing these cookie dough fundraiser ideas, your school can raise vital funds for programs and activities while enjoying a sweet and delicious treat. Remember to stay creative, engage your community, and show appreciation to your supporters. Good luck!",1,1730233227.0,u_Fundraisingzone,0,1.0,False

I absolutely love it but I also know I‚Äôm absolutely addicted. So it‚Äôs a constant state of management to see how much coffee I can get away with before it gets out of hand. 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering about others with this as a trigger (I know for many, caffeine is a treatment and helps their migraines - that‚Äôs not really the group I‚Äôm directing this to).  What patterns have you noticed?  Are your caffeine-induced headaches different in quality from those caused by other triggers?  Do they start in the same or different places on your head each time you get one?  Is it the same every time for a caffeine migraine?  I feel likei can tell them apart from those caused by other triggers. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶sharper somehow, when they start to make themselves known.

1gf481c,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gf481c/i_spent_an_afternoon_babysitting_the_four/,I spent an afternoon babysitting the four horsemen of the apocalypse,"I had been thinking about picking up a part-time job for a while now. The semester was over and I got a bunch of free time on my hands. Might as well make a bit of cash in the meantime. And so my search on Linkedin began. I was looking for something simple and stress-free. Preferably something I could do with minimal effort whilst staring at my phone to pass the time. I spent hours browsing through the sea of options. The majority of what I found were graphic design commissions, tutoring, and waiting tables, which I either lacked the skills for or just found unappealing. Just when I was about to give up, I stumbled onto a post, requesting for a babysitter. The post was vague, only including an address and a phone number. Typically, I would have just scrolled past this post and not given it a second thought. But I immediately noticed that the address was conveniently close to where I live. I decided to at least find out more. The call was answered before the first ring could finish.

‚ÄúFor the last time, I don‚Äôt want to answer your stupid surveys!‚Äù

I could hear in the background a chaotic symphony of the TV, the sound of a vacuum, and a child crying.¬†

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm calling about the babysitting job?‚Äù

I feared for what I might be getting myself into. I had no prior experience taking care of children and it sounded like I was throwing myself into the deep end of the pool with this one.

‚ÄúOh? OH! Yes, the babysitting job. Yes, thank god. It‚Äôs been a nightmare trying to find one. Look. I‚Äôm running late and I‚Äôve got about a hundred errands I need to get to. If you can get here in half an hour and look after my kids for three to four hours, five max, I‚Äôll pay you whatever you want.‚Äù

A part of me felt bad for how desperate this man sounded. The other part of me was worried about the shitstorm I might have to weather for the next five hours. The other other part of me kept replaying the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you whatever you want‚Äù in my head.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in twenty minutes.‚Äù

Fifteen minutes later I found myself in front of apartment 4H. The entire complex seemed old. Likely built in the '80s. Yet the red wallpaper, mahogany accents, and soft carpeting gave it the feel of a luxurious hotel. I could hear the same chaotic storm I had previously heard on the phone brewing inside. I felt hesitant but I already came all this way. I raised my hand up to knock, only for the door to fly open as I did.

‚ÄúOh. Hello. You're the babysitter, right?‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt look like how I pictured him at all. He wore a clean navy-colored suit and had a tall, muscular build. He was mostly well put together besides his deep sunken eye bags, messy curly hair, and unevenly shaved stubble. Despite it all, he was actually quite handsome.

‚ÄúYep. That's me,‚Äù I confirmed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fast one. Caught me by surprise,‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúPlease, come in.‚Äù

I walked into the small apartment and followed him into the living room. There, I witnessed two small boys, who both looked to be about seven or eight, fighting over a small green figure of a toy soldier. The entire living room was littered with hundreds of these soldiers and tanks scattered haphazardly across the carpeted floor. I almost didn‚Äôt notice the little girl in a black dress on the couch. She sat motionless staring at the TV. MasterChef was playing. Junior.

‚ÄúHey guys. Settle down please,‚Äù the man ordered sternly.

The three children stopped their antics and simultaneously jerked their heads around to stare at me.

‚ÄúDaddy is gonna be gone for a little while, alright? This nice lady here is‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúEmily.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmily is gonna look after you guys. While I'm gone she‚Äôs in charge. So be on your best behavior. I don‚Äôt want a repeat of last time.‚Äù

The children collectively gave a silent enthusiastic nod.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

The man then turned to me.

‚ÄúEmily, meet con‚Ä¶‚Äù the man caught himself mid-sentence.

‚ÄúSilly me. I meant to say, meet Zelos, the one in the white shirt, and Martius, the one in red. They‚Äôre twins. And Limos, the girl.‚Äù

Strange names I thought. The three children waved their little hands at me as their names were called. I awkwardly waved back.

‚ÄúPerfect. Bathroom is the door on the left,‚Äù he said as he gestured towards the connecting hallway with four doors. One on the left, two on the right, and one at the end of the hall. ‚ÄúAnd you can help yourself to anything in the fridge. Make yourself at home. Just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt go into the room at the end of the hall. That‚Äôs off limits.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no problem,‚Äù I assured him.

‚ÄúYou might hear something inside and‚Äî""

A buzzing noise interrupted him as he frantically fished around his pocket, pulling out a phone.

‚ÄúShi-oot. I really need to get going.‚Äù

He took his wallet out and without taking his eyes off of his phone, handed me a thick wad of cash.

‚ÄúHere. Order some takeout with this if they get peckish.‚Äù

Before I could think of asking questions the man disappeared out the door. I could respect an exhausted single father trying to make it through the day but he seemed awfully irresponsible leaving me, a stranger, with his kids.

I turned back to see the three children, staring at me with blank expressions.

‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm outnumbered, guys,‚Äù I joked, trying to break the ice.

They remained silent. The girl, Limos, lost quickly interest and turned her attention back to the TV. The boys craned their necks upwards, studying me. Somehow, I felt as if they were looking down on me.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs the battle going fellas?‚Äù I asked, attempting again to rid the awkward tension.

‚ÄúWould you like to play?‚Äù Martius asked.

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Zelos began to protest.

‚ÄúFather said she was in charge.‚Äù

Zelos glared at Martius, furious for even suggesting the idea that someone join their campaign. I thought it best that I remained neutral. After all, I was trying to take the next few hours as easy as possible.

‚ÄúNo it's alright. Thanks though. You guys carry on.‚Äù

I stood straight, furrowed my brows, and gave them a salute, doing my best impression of a soldier.

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù said Martius, as he saluted back.

I joined Limos on the couch, who upon a closer look, appeared thin and skinny. It was to the point where I was genuinely concerned that she had some kind of illness. Perhaps anorexia.

The small girl piped up with a soft quiet voice. ‚ÄúCan we eat? I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course we can sweetheart,‚Äù I told her, trying my best to show how concerned I was for her. Pizza ought to do some good.

We waited for the delivery to arrive. During that time the boys played on their battlefield and Limos lazed on the couch next to me. Her only presence being that of sharp breaths.

I found it rather cute that the boys weren‚Äôt smashing the tanks together and throwing toy soldiers at each other like I expected children their age would do. They looked as if they were competent generals of the great apartment war, and had to send their loyal men to die on no-man‚Äôs carpet. They paced around the battlefield, stroking their chin, careful not to step on any of the small soldiers.

I looked over at the little girl sitting next to me. She stared wide-eyed at the TV, mesmerized by the food.

Although pizza would be arriving soon, I thought I might as well rummage around in the fridge and cupboard for some snacks. I got up from the couch which alerted Zelos.

‚ÄúWhere do you think you're going?‚Äù he questioned.

‚ÄúJust gonna see if you guys have any snacks.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not for you, stranger. You think you can just come here and take what you want?‚Äù

I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I didn‚Äôt conduct myself with the maturity of my age. But something about this disrespectful little brat got on my nerves.

‚ÄúI recall your dad saying I was in charge and to ‚Äòhelp myself‚Äô to whatever I please,‚Äù I mocked, putting on a posh accent, mimicking that of royalty.

‚ÄúBitch.‚Äù

I was appalled to hear such a young boy be so vulgar and rude. I wanted to discipline him. I wanted to let him know that he was to respect me. That he should listen to what I say and learn to quickly apologize. In hindsight, this didn‚Äôt feel like me at all. I came here to make a quick buck. Why did I care so much about enduring insults from children? At that moment, I very much did care.

I straightened my posture to look as imposing as possible and stomped my foot down as hard as I could, just to try and make him flinch. As I did, I felt a sharp sting of pain shoot up my leg. I fell back onto the couch and lifted my foot onto my knees to inspect what had caused the pain. It was a toy soldier‚Äôs bayonet. The soldier‚Äôs arm was half torn off, only attached to the torso by a thin strip of green plastic. I slowly pulled the sharp plastic piece out of my foot, leaving a small stain of blood on my socks.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù I blurted aloud.

I looked up to see Zelos and Martius staring at me. Zelos, as expected, looked livid that I had broken his toy. Martius on the other hand, looked at the broken soldier that now laid on the carpet. The tip of its bayonet now covered in a dark tint of red. He had a mournful look on his face.

‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I apologized, the anger I had felt quickly fading away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy you a new one I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúTHAT WASN‚ÄôT HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO!‚Äù Zelos exploded.

‚ÄúZelos please. I‚Äôll replace it for you the next time I come over, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt be replaced,‚Äù said Martius, as he got on his knees and gingerly picked up the soldier.

He brought it to a small jar that rested on the coffee table. The jar was half filled with green plastic soldier parts. A loose collection of hands, feets, heads, and torsos. Martius carefully sets the soldier he held onto the top of the pile.

‚ÄúYou guys really shouldn‚Äôt just leave these toys on the floor like this.‚Äù

Martius shot a furious glare at me in response to that comment.

‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT CARE IF YOU‚ÄôRE IN CHARGE! IT‚ÄôS NOT FAIR!‚Äù

Then I did something I regretted. I giggled. I found it amusing how they were so immersed in this game of theirs. I tried to stop myself, especially when I saw how the twins were fuming.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm really sorry guys. I‚Äôll make it up to you I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. This is not a mistake easily amendable. But perhaps‚Ä¶‚Äù Martius stopped, turning to Zelos.

The two of them seemed to have a silent conversation between themselves. Zelos, with tears welling up in his eyes, gave Martius a solemn nod.

Zelos, reaching into his pockets, took out another toy soldier. He handed it to Martius, who in turn, presented it to me. This one was different. It was a bit shorter and had a smaller build. It was a woman, in the same soldier uniform and equipped with identical gear as the rest. This was my first close look at these toys and I was impressed with how detailed they were. Down to the intricate facial features.

I was puzzled by the realization. I was sure I was just overthinking it but the small green face that stared back at me, was mine.

Before I could examine it further, Martius quickly snatched the toy from my grasp. He marched back to the center of the carpet battlefield, with my soldier in hand.

‚ÄúPerhaps we can make you understand,‚Äù said Martius, as he places the soldier down on the carpet.

‚ÄúWait. Give that‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to say.

I never got to finish my sentence. I still don‚Äôt know which of the assaults on my senses alerted me first. Was it the awful smell of sulfuric odor, the metallic scent of blood, and the acrid tang of gunpowder? Was it the thick gritty taste of ash and smoke that lingered in the air? Was it the chorus of unintelligible screams, and the staccato of machine-gun fire that flew overhead? Regardless, what caught my attention the most, was the soldier in front me. He sat slumped into the mud and filth of the trench we were in. I knew he was dead by just the look on his face. His eyes, barely open, lazily staring at me. His jaws hung slack with a river of blood trickling from the edge of his lips. As for the rest of his body, it had been contorted to a mangled mass of flesh. His arms, attached to the torso by only a strip of sinew. His hands still held on tightly to his weapon. A rifle with a fixed bayonet.

Just a moment ago I had been sitting on a couch in a living room in a small apartment downtown. I blinked and everything changed so abruptly, I couldn‚Äôt even begin to comprehend what had happened to me.

The mud I sat on was softened by either rainwater or blood. It was cold and the moisture seeped into the uniform I now wore. Somehow sinking deeper into the ground gave me the slightest notion of comfort. Perhaps no one would notice me, I thought. I could pass for another corpse amongst the hundreds. And so I stayed quiet, holding myself back from screaming or crying. I tried remaining still but I couldn‚Äôt stop my heart from furiously beating or my teeth from chattering. I plugged my ears with my filthy fingers, covered in dirt and soot, desperately attempting to shield myself from the horrible blood-curdling screeches that could barely be said to have come from a human. I breathed small gasps of ashy air to avoid having to smell the rot. I took one last look at the dead soldier before shutting my eyes. I would‚Äôve kept them shut too if I didn‚Äôt catch a flicker of movement.

He blinked.

My eyes shot wide open, staring intently into the soldier‚Äôs soulless eyes. His eyelids began to flutter. His fingers twitched. His ankles shifted ever so slightly. Then without warning, his upper body heaved forward, lunging towards me. Its lower body didn‚Äôt follow and his spine immediately disconnected with a sickening crack. He landed at my feet, face-planting in the mud, and returned to being inanimate. I almost let out a yelp but it got caught in my dry throat. I thought that maybe some explosive shockwave had simply knocked him over.

Suddenly, his arm, attached only by a chipped bone and strips of exposed muscles flung upwards, grabbing me by my leg. I screamed but only a raspy gasp resonated as my vocal cords strained and burned. I kicked at the corpse but it refused to release its grasp. With surprising force and speed, it yanked itself towards me so that its torso landed on my knees. I felt the soft tissues of its dismembered half resting on me. Its body slumped onto mine and its face pressed right against my ears as I turned away, refusing to look at the monster. Surely I was in hell.

Then, softly, a whisper resonated deeply over the deafening sounds of the battle. The soldier croaked into my ears with a plea.

‚ÄúI ‚Äì I beg of you. Release‚Ä¶the pale rider.‚Äù

A bell rang in the distance. Like a wave, the sound washed over me and in an instant, everything fell away. The cries, the rot, the filth, and the corpse. All gone. The familiar sound of the TV and the fresh breathable air reassured me that I was back in the apartment, sitting on the floor, leaning against the couch. It was such a surreal and abrupt shift of scenery I could‚Äôve almost convinced myself it had all been in my head. That was until I saw Martius stood where he had been previously, holding a small green soldier in his hand. He looked at me, no longer with the look of anger, but of pity. I flinched as he began making his way towards me, careful of where he stepped. He crouched down next to me, took my hand, and placed the figure onto my palm. I didn‚Äôt need to look to know that it was my figure he had given me.

‚ÄúTake better care of this one,‚Äù he said to me as if I was a child in his eyes.

The familiar note of the bell that had pulled me back to the apartment rang once again. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize that it was the doorbell I had been hearing. Someone was at the door.

‚ÄúPizza time!‚Äù Limos shouted excitedly.

Slowly, I pushed myself off the floor, found my balance, then began making my way towards the door. I‚Äôm sure many of you, in my shoes, would‚Äôve taken this opportunity to escape. Likewise, I had made the decision that I was going to run fast and far the moment I opened the door, leaving this accursed apartment of demonic children. No amount of money could be worth what I had just experienced. I found myself in a small sprint as I neared the door. My hand shot out towards the handle and I forcefully yanked the door open, pulling myself into the hallway.

I was greeted by the fragrance of pizza and nothing. Utter darkness. The hallway I had entered from earlier, now void of any light besides the faint glow coming from the apartment. All that seemed to exist within the hallway was me and the box of pizza on the floor. Domino‚Äôs.

I stood there, contemplating on what to do. Perhaps the electricity had just simply gone out. That was fine, because I recalled where the stairwell was located. I could still escape.

‚ÄúAre you going to share?‚Äù

Limos‚Äôs voice from behind startled me. I leapt away from her and the apartment, deeper into the hall. She was standing at the threshold of the apartment. Between the two of us, the pizza box sat patiently.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hungry.‚Äù

The look on her face read of desperation. The black dress she wore appeared to hang loosely on her body. I was sure it fitted her earlier but now it seemed a few sizes too big.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she begged again. ‚ÄúThe pale one is close.‚Äù

There it was again. The mention of this pale thing. Upon hearing this ominous omen, I turned around and blindly sprinted in the opposite direction down the hall where I remembered the stairs to be. It had to be there. My foot stamped and beat against the floor as I bolted in a straight line. In the pitch black, it was impossible to see how close I was. I fully expected to eventually run into a wall. No obstacle ever came.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something you can outrun,‚Äù Limos spoke again, the volume of her voice noticeably hadn‚Äôt faltered with the distance I had traveled.

I stopped in my tracks. I turned to face her thinking she had followed me. She hadn‚Äôt. She still remained at the threshold of the apartment doorway. The pizza box still laid on the floor between us. And I stood where I had been at the start. A mere few feet out the apartment.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the fastest, but it‚Äôll catch you,‚Äù she spoke as I struggled to catch my breath. ‚ÄúIt always does.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked her, demanding the child for an answer.

I was at a loss. Everything certain that I built my understanding of the world on had crumbled away. What was left was anger and fear. Like a small mouse cornered and out of options.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pizza.‚Äù

‚ÄúWHAT IS THIS PLACE!‚Äù I yelled back, finally losing my temper. I never thought myself capable of hurting a child but at that moment, I was prepared to do so.

‚ÄúDomino.‚Äù

‚ÄúENOUGH!‚Äù I screamed as I lunged at her, attempting to do something horrible.

I reached out to grab her by the collar of her dress. She didn‚Äôt step backwards or attempt to dodge, yet somehow she shifted ever so slightly out of my reach. I fell flat on my face onto the cold solid floor, now noticing that I wasn‚Äôt even sure what I had been standing on. I felt pain, followed by blood trickling out of my nose. It most certainly wasn‚Äôt the soft carpeted floor I recalled when first arriving at this apartment complex.

As I laid prone on the floor, I stared up at the frail girl who now stood above me with an imposing presence. Behind her, the light of the apartment in stark contrast to the darkness made her figure a dark silhouette. I felt defeated. I didn‚Äôt even try to stand back up. I may not have been sure where I was but the ground felt solid and tangible. It was something I could be certain of and that brought me comfort.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked again, this time my question came out quivering.

Limos crouched down, inspecting me as if I was a small insect she found crawling across the floor.

‚ÄúThe path,‚Äù she answered.

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù she asked me, ignoring my question.

Her concern sounded genuine. I wanted to tell her I wasn‚Äôt since food was the least of my worries, but as soon as she asked, it was as if she reminded my body of the idea of hunger. I felt starved. I felt hunger like I had never felt before. My stomach curled and cramped within me, screaming for sustenance. The aroma of the pizza now overpowering all my senses. I could almost taste the fragrance in the air itself.

‚ÄúY-Yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you strong?‚Äù she asked again.

‚ÄúY-‚Äù I hesitated to answer. How could I be strong in the state I was in?

‚ÄúDo you want to live?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Yes please. Please let me live,‚Äù I begged her. ‚ÄúPlease help me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to live too,‚Äù she said as she began stepping towards the pizza box.

She gently lifted the cardboard box open and the smell of the bubbling cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni had me salivating. I immediately mustered up my last bit of strength and brought myself to my hands and knees. I crawled in the direction of the beckoning food, yet quickly realized I was making no progress. As if I was on a hamster wheel, I simply could not move any closer. I started to crawl faster, with more desperation, and before long, I had gotten onto my feet. I stumbled toward the little girl, who was now hunched over the pizza box on the floor with her back facing me. My stumbling sped up until I jogged, then ran, then to a full-on sprint. No matter how fast or slow I went, I made no progress. They were right there in front of me. I was so close yet so infinitely far. All I could do was move in place, watching Limos scarf down each slice before me. As she gleefully ate, my only thought was the dwindling food left for me when I eventually reached the pizza box. She was going to eat it all for herself and leave me with nothing. I couldn‚Äôt let that happen. One after another, the slices of pizza disappeared down her gluttonous gullet. I remember begging her to help me. To toss me just a bit. To save some for me. She never bothered to turn around. I yelled and screamed but eventually, I grew too tired to do so.

Finally, it came down to the final slice. She reached for it like she did the others. As I felt the last bit of my strength drain, in desperation, I tried leaping towards her one last time. I fully assumed that I would just land on my face as I did before, no closer to salvation. Yet I held out hope. I think that was what did it. Desperate, violent hope. One last act of defiance against the inevitable death. This time, I felt myself propel forward and for the first time, Limos rapidly approached me. I slammed into the small frail child, landing on top of her with incredible force. She yelped in surprise and pain as I felt her brittle right arm snap under the weight of my knee. In that moment, not only did I dismiss the injury I caused her, I felt retribution as it was revenge for watching me suffer. I quickly turned my attention to the box of pizza which to my horror, was now empty.

Furious, I turned back to Limos, who I now see in her right hand, despite the pain of her fractured arm, still held onto the last slice. Without hesitation, I ripped it out of her hand and forcefully shoved it down my throat. I expected it to taste like the most savory, delicious bite and yet, as my taste buds familiarized itself with the gooey slop, I was met with the disgusting taste of rot. Involuntarily, I threw up what little was left in my stomach. Black viscous liquid poured out of my mouth along with the half-chewed pizza. It appeared molded and putrid, as if it had been neglected for months. Dark moldy spots of purple and green hue festered on the crust. Small specks of pale maggots writhed in the spoiled cheese and toppings. I spat onto the floor, attempting to wash the terrible taste that lingered.

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Limos shrieked in horror as I keeled over the pile of vomit in excruciating pain.

With my knee still holding her down by her broken arm, she began to struggle with a surprising spur of strength. I watched as she forcefully tugged on her fractured arm, steam exuding from her elbow. Gradually, her arm stretched and strained as she pulled. I was too weak and terrified to stop her. With a wail of pain and triumph, she slid the bone of her forearm out of her arm as if it were a sleeve made of muscle and skin. The motion was so smooth it was like pulling the bone out of a tenderized rib.

Upon freeing herself, she pushed me aside and with her one arm, scooped the black vile mass into her mouth. The sound of animalistic slurping and feral grunts was all I heard. No traces of humanity were left. As she devoured the filth with reckless abandon my attention turned to the steaming flesh that she left behind. I feared a part of me knew that I was not far from descending to her level of madness.

It reminded me of the burning smell of human flesh from the trenches. I reached out to it. Piping hot to the touch. I grabbed onto the wrist and with a revolting squish, the skin and muscle fiber fell apart like pulled pork.

Just then, a shadow casted over me. A figure loomed before me, covering the light of the apartment.

‚ÄúPathetic,‚Äù Zelos taunted with a disgusted look of pity on his face.

I could only imagine what he saw of me. Then he slammed the door shut leaving me shrouded in true darkness.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I was there for. The awful sound of Limos‚Äôs savagery quickly died down as she finished what was left of my excretion. After that, it was hard to tell how much time had passed. I stayed grovelling on the ground, my hand still held on the warm moist lump of the girl‚Äôs discarded flesh. My hunger grew ever stronger but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. To stoop so low. To even think of consuming my own. It was abominable. I thought it better to be starved to death. To finally be free of this nightmare. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to understand or condone my actions, but know that I was pushed to the brink of my sanity. A deep primal urge within me wanted so desperately to live. To survive at any cost. So reluctantly, I held the mass of flesh and slowly brought it to my mouth, thankful that at the very least I could not see what I had to do. As I choked on the gamey meat through sobs, I heard a shuffling sound approach me. I couldn‚Äôt see her but I knew Limos was standing right next to me while I chewed on her member.

‚ÄúYou are strong,‚Äù she whispered.

Within the void, a blinding light washed over us. I squinted my eyes and in an instant, just as seamless as it had been in the trench, I found myself back in the apartment. Except this time it was quiet and empty. The TV had been turned off and the floor was cleared of the toys. The insatiable hunger I had felt mere moments ago faded away. The only thing left of the horrors in the abyss was the vile aftertaste that continued to linger. It quickly came to my realization that I appeared to be alone in the apartment. I got up and did a quick scan of the living room and the kitchen to confirm it. I was alone. Perhaps they had retreated back into their rooms. I looked down the hall to the bedrooms, which now appeared more threatening and ominous. As if some new terror lurks behind each door.

Once again, I found myself with an opportunity to escape. This time however, I feared using the front door and ending up back in that terrible purgatory. The next method of exit would be out the window. I could still hear the sound of bustling pedestrians and traffic outside. It calmed me knowing that I was still somewhat connected with the outside world. I was four stories up with no safe way of getting down, but at that point I was content with simply risking the fall. To my disappointment, the window refused to budge when I tried lifting it open. It was an old wooden framed window with no locks on it. Through some supernatural means, it was simply immovable. On the verge of a breakdown, I grabbed the nearest solid object to me which was a desk lamp and proceeded to smash it into the glass as hard as I could. I couldn‚Äôt even leave a scratch. Feeling at a loss, I reluctantly tried the door once again. Slowly and carefully, I opened the door, making sure that I kept myself within the confines of the apartment.

To my relief, I was no longer greeted by the abyss. The hallway had returned to its original state. Hesitantly, I stepped out into the hallway. As I crossed the threshold out the apartment, a faint cry emanated from behind me. It was the sound of an infant bawling. I flinched as the crying broke the eerie silence. It's odd that the sound of a helpless baby crying could invoke such fear within me but nevertheless I sprinted out of the apartment and ran for the stairwell. My heart pumped furiously as I sprinted as fast as I could away from the danger, taking two or three steps at a time. As I reached the ground level, I bursted out the stairwell door into the lobby. I found myself standing at the threshold of apartment 4H. The baby‚Äôs crying now intensified. I turned back expecting the stairwell I had just exited to still be behind me. The same hallway on the fourth floor greeted me. After being led on with the hopes of escape only to be denied it once again, I fell onto my knees and wept. For the next few hours I cried along with the infant.

In the lasting moments I stayed idle, the sunlight from the window never seemed to dim. The father, the man who lured me into this abstract non-euclidian prison, has yet to return, and I doubted he ever will. Eventually, my crying ceased as my eyes ran dry. The infant however, continued its tantrum alone. Its lungs never tired or faltered. Hours, perhaps even days go by. In the time I‚Äôve attempted multiple times to escape. My phone had no signal or connection and any attempt to reach the outside world failed. I tried the stairwell again only to find myself back in the apartment every time. I went knocking on the neighboring apartment doors only to be met with silence. When I tried forcing my way in, to my surprise, none of the doors were locked. Only it seemed every apartment was apartment 4H. The elevator, no matter what floor I chose, always opened to apartment 4H.

I never grew hungry or thirsty. I never tired or slept. I just existed in this static space where the sun never waned, the scenery unchanged, and the crying endless. I felt the essence of my soul dim. I had fought with all I had and committed heinous atrocities for the right to live. Now as I sat on the kitchen floor, feeling the sharp cool edge of a kitchen knife brush gently against my neck, I wondered why I had fought so hard. It‚Äôs okay to give up now, right? I‚Äôve tried everything. I‚Äôm at the end of the road. With my eyes shut, my grip on the blade‚Äôs handle tightened as I slowly pressed the sharp edge firmly against my throat. I applied pressure slowly, still fearing the last stretch of pain before I could finally rest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù a child‚Äôs voice piped up.

I froze, unable to even breathe. I hesitated to open my eyes. I could hear the child sniffling and whimpering in front of me. I had gotten so used to it, the sudden absence of the baby‚Äôs cries unnerved me.

‚ÄúCan you stay with me?‚Äù they asked, in a high-pitched shrill voice. It was the voice of a little girl but it didn‚Äôt sound like Limos.

I still held the blade closely to my neck with my eyes shut tightly. It felt reassuring that I could end the torment anytime I wanted to. To finally hold my own life in my hand. It gave me a sense of courage. My eyelids loosened and my vision fluttered open. Expecting to see a small child, instead towering over me was an old woman. She was impossibly tall, to the point she had to hunch over to avoid the ceiling. She stood naked, covered only by her long unkempt gray hair. Her ashened skin, although saggy and wrinkled, were clean and eerily pale. It was like the first hint of snowfall on a solstice, where soft curved patches of snow layered atop another. I didn‚Äôt notice a hint of blemish or imperfection. Her face however was that of a child. Up to her neck her skin becomes smooth like porcelain. Youth was distilled on only her facial features. Buttoned nose, wide eyes, small pink lips, and rounded cheeks. She looked at me with tears welling up in her puppy eyes.

‚ÄúCan you read to me?‚Äù she asked, in the same childish voice. It was uncanny to see the thing speak.

I remained silent, unsure of how to respond. She raised her bony hand and reached her thin fingers towards me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I hissed, turning the knife onto her.

She quickly retracted her hand and backed away, retreating to the far end of the kitchen. For a moment I felt relieved to see this creature feared me as much I feared it. The moment was short-lived as her brow tightened, her cheeks flushed and her mouth tensed. She looked like she was about to burst.

‚ÄúWhy? Why do you still resist? Why can‚Äôt you just stay with me? It won‚Äôt hurt. It won‚Äôt ever hurt again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I demanded.

She looked at me curiously. Her face softened, as if comprehending my question.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the last one,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm what's left when everyone is gone.‚Äù

Her expression shifted back to sadness, and I watched as a single streak of tear ran down her cheek.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lonely,‚Äù she sniveled.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay.‚Äù

Through her watery eyes, she cracked a warm smile.

‚ÄúYou will. You always do.‚Äù

The way she said it didn‚Äôt sound like a threat.

‚ÄúIs there a way to leave?‚Äù I asked, my eyes darting towards the open door to the hallway.

Her eyes followed mine out the door, then she looked back at me, shaking her head.

‚ÄúWhat can I do then?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can rest,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù

The sweetness in her tone made the idea sound rather comfortable.

‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶‚Äù she hesitated. ‚ÄúOr you can put me to rest.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happens if I do that?‚Äù I questioned, intrigued by an alternative choice.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll see you again, down the road.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I can leave?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now. You‚Äôll be back soon enough.‚Äù

She reached towards me, handing me a card I hadn‚Äôt previously noticed. Cautiously, I held it by the corner and took it. It was a polaroid. The image is blurry and yellowed by time. The photograph depicted an extreme wide shot of a beautiful meadow. In the distance, four horses frolicked in the tall grass.

I looked back at her, wondering what she was trying to tell me. With a grin on her face she excitedly twirls her finger around, signaling for me to turn the photo. I flipped it over and saw that written on the back in beautiful cursive handwriting, was a poem.

‚ÄúRead to me,‚Äù she said, as she made her way onto the couch in the living room.

She sat down, curling herself into the corner. She patted the cushion next to her, beckoning for me to join. I set the knife down on the kitchen counter and complied.

With a gentle tone, as if singing a lullaby, I began to read the poem aloud.

‚ÄúDawn heralded the coming of their steeds,

Each rider, a calamity of man‚Äôs sinful deeds.‚Äù

I glanced at her, to see her nodding in approval.

‚ÄúKeep going.‚Äù

I continued onto the next line.

‚ÄúFirst came conquest, who bolstered the pride of man,

The white messenger's taunt is where it all began.

Then war swiftly followed, with fiery hate in his heart,

The red knight's blade spilled blood, torn flesh apart.

Next crept famine, that consumed the very last bite,

The black witch's spell shrouded the world with blight.‚Äù

My voice cracks, as I was reminded of the corpse and the abyss. My mouth felt dry and a chill ran down my spine. I pressed on.

‚ÄúFinally arrived death, as they all wept and grieved,

The pale lady's touch gently granted them reprieve.‚Äù

My speech faltered as the realization dawned on me.

‚ÄúThe pale rider,‚Äù I muttered under my breath. I turned to see her eyes closed and her expression softened. She breathed steadily, her chest heaving with each inhale.

Even though she was asleep, I proceeded to read the final line of the poem to myself.

‚ÄúOne after another the domino falls,

Until dusk whisks the horsemen back to their stalls.‚Äù

As I finished, I felt a tear fall across my face. A tremendous wave of relief washed over me. As if a heavy burden had finally been lifted. Like for the first time in my life, I could truly breathe.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I told her as she slept. ‚ÄúBut not today. I can endure it for a bit longer.‚Äù

Then I watch the folds and sags of her skin tighten. Her body shrunk before me. Her hair retracted back into their follicles. Until laying beside me, was an infant. I carefully picked her up and carried her down the hall to the final room at the end. As I did, I walked past the three other rooms, the doors to which now hung open. In the first door on the right, I saw Zelos and Martius, sleeping in a bunk bed. I peeked inside, shut the lights off and closed the door as quietly as I could.

I continued down the hall and in the second door on the right, I saw Limos shivering in a fetal position on her bed. I walked over and pulled a blanket over her. Instantly her body relaxed and her breathing calmed. Again, I turned the lights off and closed the door behind me.

Onto the final room at the end of hall. Carefully balancing the infant in one arm, I turned the doorknob and stepped through. This room was by far the largest and most empty. Only three things took up any space. A crib in the center of the room, a small cot tucked away in the corner, and a wooden rocking horse painted white.

On the horse, carved the phrase: *M√≥ros, who stole our pain*¬†

I carefully set the child down in her crib and watched her nestle comfortably. Her breathing was gentle and rhythmic, with each exhale a delicate sigh escaped. She looked so fragile and serene, as if held in a moment untouched by time. The soft rays of the afternoon sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across her smooth, pale skin.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs beautiful, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

The voice of a man came from behind me. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was still familiar.

‚ÄúShe is,‚Äù I replied, not taking my eyes off the child.

The man joined me at my side and the two of us shared a quiet moment adoring the child.

‚ÄúThis is as close as I can be to her,‚Äù he said, somberly. ‚ÄúAnd yet you choose to continue suffering?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always suffering. There are moments like these that make the pain worth it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps. But you live as long as I have, experience the highest of highs and the lowest of low‚Ä¶I tire of this infinite stasis. I yearn for the day I shut my eyes for the last time.‚Äù

He spoke with no emotion. As heart wrenching as his words were, it was as if he‚Äôs said them before countless times. There was only one question on my mind. After encountering conquest, war, famine, and now death, I wondered just who this man who claimed to be their father was.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre thinking what kind of man I am to deserve this fate,‚Äù he said, as if reading my thoughts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a divine punishment to care for them. It‚Äôs a father‚Äôs duty after all. They are born of my sin. I may have fathered humanity‚Äôs ruin but to see my fellow man struggle and fight, refusing to let their next breath be their last‚Ä¶I am in awe of your resilience.‚Äù

I should have felt hatred towards the man. I should have held him responsible for the horrors I endured. Yet, without another word shared between us, I stepped away from the crib, and took my leave. I shut the door as I left, the last thing I saw being the man standing over his child, his fists clenched so tightly that beads of blood trickled down the creases of his hands.¬†

I walked out the apartment, descended down the stairwell, entered into the lobby and finally, I stepped out of the building onto the bustling sidewalk. If not for the polaroid tucked away in my pocket, I might have tried to convince myself that it was all a fever dream for the sake of my sanity. I took the photo out just to confirm it.¬†

I studied it for a moment, confused that the picture had now changed. In place of the four horses that ran across the horizon now stood four children. Two boys and two girls. They watched as before them, a lone man stood atop a corpse with a caved in skull with a bloodied stone in his hand. I flipped the polaroid over and as I had predicted, the poem had also been replaced.¬†

It now simply read: *The folly of Cain*",5,1730232735.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
