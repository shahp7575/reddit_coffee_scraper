I'm in my 40's and never had a date in my life. Literally, not a single person since has ever once thought I was worth spending 10 minutes with to even get a damn cup of coffee. It doesn't feel good , I can tell you that. 

I casually asked out a woman I talk too sometimes . She talked about being bored and lonely , so I just went for it. I wasn't surprised when she rejected me, I'm used to it. I'm used to an ever increasing and varied ways people can let me know they aren't interested in me other than a momentary distraction. But walking home, seeing couples at outdoor restaurants and bars it's like 'fuck. I'm really not allowed to participate in this aspect of life.
Like what is even the point of liking people if they are just going to reject you?

1jd2unr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lelit/comments/1jd2unr/inconsistent_extraction_time_need_help_lelit/,Inconsistent Extraction Time - Need Help! [Lelit Elizabeth v3],"Hey everyone,

I'm having an issue with my new Lelit Elizabeth and I was hoping to get some advice from the community. My previous machine was a DeLonghi Dedica, and I used to get very consistent extraction times within 30 seconds (± 2s) for a 1:2 ratio using 15g of coffee. However, with the Lelit Elizabeth, I'm experiencing significant inconsistencies despite following the exact same preparation process.

https://preview.redd.it/bkmz8t9vv5pe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe8ddd16e380592580868023b6f5f0d51d75cbb

**The Issue:**  
With 17g of coffee, aiming to extract 34g, my extraction times vary wildly. Sometimes I get 34g in 25 seconds, other times it takes 45s, and occasionally over 60s. In some cases, the coffee starts flowing after 20 seconds and comes out very slowly. A couple of times, no coffee even flowed at all.

**Quality Variations:**  
Crema inconsistencies (sometimes none at all, sometimes great)  
Taste fluctuates between great, good, bad, and horrible  
Different flow rates despite using the same grind settings and preparation process

**My Extraction Settings:**  
Extraction temperature: 93°C  
Boiler temperature: 132°C  
Preinfusion: 5s  
Pressure: 9 bars  
Water: Bottled water (ideal mineralization)

*I also tested with:*  
Preinfusion at 10s and 2s  
Pressure at 10 bars  
None of these changes helped.

**My Grinder:**

**Additional Observation:**  
After powering on the machine for the first time and seeing the ""OK"" signal on the display, I noticed that if I do a water purge through the group head, there is a lot of steam along with a strange steam noise. After a couple of purges by tapping the extract buttons 1 and 2, the steam stops.

**My Preparation Process:**

1. Weigh 17g of coffee beans
2. Spray water on the beans twice
3. Grind the beans into a shaker and weigh again to confirm exactly 17g
4. Shake for 20 seconds
5. Transfer grounds into the portafilter
6. Gentle bumps to settle the coffee
7. WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique)
8. Tamp (Im used to do this process very consistently, I've been doing this for 4 years now)
9. Extract

I've done over 20 tests with the same grind setting and coffee, yet the results are all over the place. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this inconsistency? Any suggestions on what to check or tweak?

Thanks BPPV. So I get BPPV attacks from my menieres ear - when the ear fills up it knocks the crystals out of place according to my doctor.

I had vertigo Tuesday and now I’m back to basic regular life. Lower salt- no coffee and tons of walking to get my system going.  

Just kinda venting. No one else gets it so sorry to fill this space but it is appreciated. I guess my next step is to learn the head movements I can do at home. I had the eply done on Wednesday and with a round of steroids to knock the fullness I have been feeling really good. 


But I’m just scared of the what if…. What if this is regular idk. How many times can I do the eply? So far I’m at 3 this past year I believe. It really does help me personally though. 

Maybe I need a steroid shot. I’m going to think on this.

I am taking him to the emergency room in the morning. What can I expect? I am bracing myself for them to do the bare minimum and cut him loose, which would be terrible.

Has anyone else been flagged, blocked, or had their accounts locked recently on CashApp for no real reason?
My personal examples: My best friend's account got literally flagged and barred from certain features all of the sudden last week. When she tried to find out what happened they just kept saying she needed more verification? She has had the account for quite some time and everything was current. They then a couple days later told her her account was flagged for peer to peer transactions seeming suspicious.... THE APP WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED FOR PEER TO PEER TRANSACTIONS like paying people for coffee or simple services or groceries?! 
Why is that suddenly a ""Suspicious Activity""!?
Cue today, my account Also got flagged? I was trying to send my fiance $35 in grocery money and the app told me it had an error from my bank? I tried a second time and cancelled again but this time I get the error page. But told him it ""Cancelled this transaction from (me) for your protection"" 
What the hell is that for? So I try to contact support and of course it's AI (garbage) bot tells me it sometimes flags transactions for suspicious activity. So I'm like is my account in trouble? The AI bit of course doesn't understand 😒
So I ask for a human, but of course their offices closed in the next five minutes so it told me I would have to wait until tomorrow. 

I used ZELLE instead with ZERO issue. This isn't the first random weird time CashApp has pulled some weirdo moves but has anyone else received problems like this?

However, with the Lelit Elizabeth, I'm experiencing significant inconsistencies despite following the exact same preparation process.

**The Issue:**  
With 17g of coffee, aiming to extract 34g, my extraction times vary wildly. Sometimes I get 34g in 25 seconds, other times it takes 45s, and occasionally over 60s. In some cases, the coffee starts flowing after 20 seconds and comes out very slowly. A couple of times, no coffee even flowed at all.

Extraction temperature: 93°C  
Boiler temperature: 132°C

When the silence continued, CLOE reportedly went table to table, calling out unsuspecting customers. ""One guy was just trying to enjoy his latte, and she told him he should be *honored* to be in her presence,"" another witness recalled. ""He just blinked at her.""  

Eventually, in a dramatic display worthy of a music video, CLOE flipped her sunglasses down, let out an exasperated sigh, and stormed out, vowing to ""never return to such an ungrateful establishment.""

i (24f) met this guy (26m) on hinge about a month ago. at the time i was visiting home and wound up not getting back to the city we're both living in for a bit, so we spoke online for maybe two weeks before we met up together -- a very chill, casual date of walking in one of the city's parks (a mutual hobby) and coffee after. he was a little shy in person (i am too, but i talk too much when i get nervous) but overall the conversation was good and on our walk to the train station he asked to hold my hand, which was sweet.

we met up again yesterday and went to an exhibition at a gallery relatively near my place. he bought the tickets and i said i'd pay him back or grab him a drink after, so he said we'd go for drinks. (the pub was packed so we went to a café instead and had coffees and some snacks. i doubt this matters lol.) anyway, this time we're both a bit chattier and again, conversation is good. a couple of times he's quite casual with touching -- bumping knees, tipping my hand while i'm showing him something on my phone, brushing my knee with his hand. i notice but don't say anything, and don't dislike it, though it's a little unexpected because, as i've said, he's quite reserved.

as the café is closing (9pm) he asks if i'd like to go back to his place, or perhaps to mine if it's closer. i'm a little caught off-guard, and because he's on his way to the restroom when he says it, i tell him i'll check with my building if i'm able to have guests over. (i'm a phd student and i live in student dorms; we have to register guests in advance.) i know that i absolutely don't want to go to his and don't want to have him to mine either, so when he comes back i just make up an excuse about not being able to have guests on such short notice; he asks again if i want to go to his, and i tell him i've got to meet a classmate of mine early in the morning to go over some work we're collaborating on. he doesn't push it -- though maybe he seems a little disappointed? or maybe that's in my head, i have to be honest -- and says he'll walk me home. he asks again to hold my hand. it's overall a pretty nice walk home. 

afterwards i just text him to say thanks for walking me home and to tell him i hope he gets home alright. i did want to bring up the whole ""inviting me back"" thing but i thought it'd be better to do it in the morning; however he shoots back with a nice text about the day and then asks, very politely, about my intentions for dating, etc etc. it's a really respectful question, and we have a generally respectful conversation about our goals and similar commitment levels etc. i admit that a past relationship (a LONG time ago) has made it difficult for me to trust people or to be very proactively affectionate, and that because i'm very inexperienced i'd really rather take things slow. he's very chill about all of this and generally super sweet.

my issue is that i can't help but feel that inviting me back to his was just for sex -- which is fine, and he's entitled to ask, and he was respectful when i said that i couldn't. (i imagine he would've been respectful if i'd said 'no' outright, too, but i'm not really forward like that and i was a bit caught off-guard.) but i think if he's comfortable going that quickly when we haven't even kissed yet it suggests a certain sort of incompatibility to me. i didn't give him any sign that i wanted the date to go any further, and i'm a little irritated that he asked without having any reasonable grounds for thinking i'd say yes. i was glad that he was open to a conversation about everything but i haven't brought up the whole invite yet because i haven't really settled on what i think about it. 

i guess i'd just like some other perspectives. can a guy invite you back to his (or ask to come to yours) after a date like that without the intention of sex? i find it weird that he'd ask to hold my hand but imply sex so casually. the date didn't work up to that and (because of my own history, and because i'm not 100% sure we have romantic chemistry) i didn't initiate any physical contact with him at any point, so i'm not sure why he'd ask.

me questioning whether we have a romantic connection is totally besides this point, for the record -- i was wondering that anyway, and i've been pretty clear about it. i just want to know what to make of this. 

**TL;DR: reserved guy asks me back to his at the end of the second date; is it just a sex thing? does he think i'll put out if he holds out?**",0,1742176971.0,dating_advice,13,0.5,False

1jd1xgp,https://timecrafter.carrd.co,I Downloaded a Time Blocking App. Now My Life is Literally in Blocks.,"Let me start by saying I’ve always sucked at productivity. My ADHD brain oscillates between doomscrolling TikTok and staring at walls like they’re IMAX screens. Then, last week, I stumbled on an ad for an app called **TimeCrafter**—*“Transform your chaotic life into perfectly segmented time blocks!”* It had *one* review: *“Works too well. Do not download. ⭐”* Sold.  

I installed it, and the interface was… weird. No tutorials, just a blank calendar and a pulsing red button labeled **“Block Time Now.”** I scheduled my first block: *“2:00–3:00 PM – Write TPS Report.”* Instantly, my laptop froze. The clock on my desk melted into a puddle of numbers. Then, the room *split*.  

A glowing, translucent cube materialized around me. Inside it, the air hummed. My brain fog vanished. I wrote the TPS report in 20 minutes, then tried to leave the cube. *Couldn’t.* The walls were solid. At 3:00 PM sharp, the cube shattered, and time snapped back to normal. My boss emailed: *“Best TPS report ever!”*  

**I was hooked.**  

I blocked everything. *8:00–8:30 AM – Coffee.* A cube spawned, forcing me to sip espresso while a countdown glared. *No procrastination. No distractions.* My productivity skyrocketed. I even blocked *“10:00–10:15 PM – Existential Dread,”* which somehow made my anxiety… orderly?  

Then things got weird.  

I overslept and missed a block labeled *“7:00–7:15 AM – Feed Cat.”* At 7:16 AM, my apartment filled with the sound of a thousand meows. My cat, Mr. Whiskers, duplicated. Twelve of them. All judging me. I panicked and created a new block: *“7:20–7:35 AM – Fix Cat Problem.”* The cube spawned, but inside was a *void*. No cats. No me. Just static. When the block ended, the clones were gone… but Mr. Whiskers now has three tails.  

**Reddit, it got worse.**  

I tried blocking *“9:00–9:30 PM – Talk to Crush.”* The cube dropped me into a dinner scene with Sarah from HR. She was pixelated, like a Sims character. I tried to speak, but my words came out as dropdown menus. She laughed robotically. Now she texts me in **bold, size 12 Arial font**.  

Last night, I messed with the app’s “Advanced Settings.” Big mistake. I created overlapping blocks: *“Workout”* during *“Nap Time.”* My body split into two cubes. One me did burpees; the other snored. When the blocks collided, *I glitched*. Now I’m stuck with a leg that randomly kicks and a left eye that’s always asleep.  

**The final straw?** I tried deleting the app. It replied: *“USER TERMINATION BLOCKED. SCHEDULE ‘UNINSTALL’ BETWEEN 13:00–13:15 PM, 3023.”*  

I’m posting this from a **“8:00–8:10 PM – Warn Reddit”** block. The cube is flickering. I hear whispers: *“Productivity requires sacrifice.”* My fingers are typing on their own. Don’t ignore one-star reviews. Don’t—

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It is a global movement fueled by an unstoppable community, real-world adoption, and a vision that goes far beyond blockchain. This is how DeFi becomes the biggest thing on the planet.

Kendu holders are built different. Most crypto projects rely on hype and short-term speculation. Kendu is backed by people who actually believe in it. These are diamond hands and true believers, the kind of community that took Kendu to a $300 million market cap. And that is just the beginning.

Now, here is where things get wild. Kendu is not just a token. It is an entire ecosystem coming to life. Kendu Beer is happening. Kendu Coffee is already brewing. A Kendu Cartoon is in the works. A Kendu Game is on the way. Kendu Jewelry lets you wear the future. And it does not stop there. Kendu is hitting the real world hard with events across the globe, including Kendu Nights in India and massive meetups in key cities.

What makes this different? There are no VC overlords and no central control. This is pure, community-driven innovation. The people building Kendu are not here to make a quick buck. They are here to change the game and create something that lasts. When a viral online army combines with real-world adoption, the result is exponential growth.

The future of DeFi will not be built by faceless corporations. It will be built by people who actually use and believe in the technology. Kendu is leading that charge.

Massive things are ahead. Stay tuned.

1jd1siy,https://i.redd.it/n0aj5gk3p5pe1.jpeg,Before the Coffee Gets Cold,"Review: Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi
Just finished this one, and wow—it’s like a warm hug and a punch to the gut at the same time.  

The good:
- The premise is chef’s kiss. A Tokyo café lets you time-travel, but with RULES (no changing the past, gotta finish before your coffee cools, etc.). It’s equal parts whimsical and heartbreaking.  
- The café itself feels alive—like a character haunted by regrets and quiet hope.  
- Kawaguchi nails the bittersweet vibes. If you’ve ever wanted to confront someone from your past, this book will wreck you (in a good way).  

The meh:
- Took me forever to keep the characters straight. They start off kinda thin, and I kept mixing up who was who.  
- Predictable AF. You’ll see the emotional beats coming, which softened the blow a little.  

Verdict: It’s not perfect, but it’s worth reading for the mood alone. Perfect if you’re into quiet, introspective stories with a splash of magic.  

Hot take: The best time-travel stories aren’t about changing the past—they’re about how revisiting it changes you.  

PSA: Full review on my tumblr (@thebookkolektiv) if you wanna dive deeper, also on Instagram.

My old form teacher (I'm at uni now, she's from school) has asked if I'd like to meet for coffee, and it would be really rude to say no, so I am going to see her.

I'm just so scared. She absolutely terrifies me! 

She's the first person who ever questioned my eating, and was always questioning anything odd (like her seeing me in the library at lunch, and asking when/where and what I ate). 

I basically saw her as a massive threat to my ED and someone I had to avoid at all costs. 

My mum and her were in at least weekly, sometimes daily contact around my ED. Updates, changes etc. For quite a few years! She called in to my big team meetings when I was in hospital, and knew the ins and outs of my treatment and all the different transfers.

Now, I'm of course not in the same situation, but the idea of seeing her for coffee is horrifying. She's lovely, but even saying goodbye to her a few years ago at school had me shaking like a leaf...

She will absolutely be looking at my body and making a judgement based on size. I'm well, but I hate being perceived, and knowing that I'm walking into a situation where someone is going to look at my body, makes me want to combust lol 🥲

We kind of had a toxic relationship. We’d fight almost every week, laging about sa ugali. Cycle siya, may sasabihin akong problema tapos he would take it as an attack at first tapos hindi mag uusap for hours or days. 

We talked about this cycle before, yung may problem then he wouldn’t take it nicely magcclash kami sa chats then silent treatment for hours or even days. Na improve naman namin to, before it takes weekss bago kami mag usap. I asked him bat ganon siya and he said na pag nagsasabi ako ng nafifeel or problema, nauuna daw init ng ulo ko agad kaya andami kong nasasabi out of anger. He said pag ganon he needed time/ space to process it all bago niya marealize or maka respond ng maayos. Ako kasi pag galit, talagang confrontational as in ichachat ko talaga lahat ng nafifeel ko so yun. Aminado naman ako na hindi ko pa siya naiimprove and mali ako don. 

For context, we both live in Batangas and our houses are 10 mins away from each other lang. Lately, nabusy si bf sa work laging OT (6 days/ wk) at first I understand naman kung bakit due to a valid reason naman and always naman siya naka update sakin pero kasi ilang months na din na ganon and I wanted quality time from him. Inopen ko yun last night sakaniya kasi nagdate kami. I told him na nawawalan na siya ng time for me, usually kasi pagkauwi niya from work after kumain and maligo onting usap lang then tutulog na siya. Lately, I felt down too because I’m still unemployed and I felt na paulit ulit lang ginagawa ko araw araw so I needed more of him kaya nahingi ako ng time. 
Onga pala, in a week usually nagkikita kami saturday night lang and minsan sunday afternoon so ilang hours talaga. Before kasi nung college, we spent so much time with each other so siguro nanibago din ako. 

So yun, nagdate kami last night (sat) and inask niya ko if sasamahan ko daw ba siya for his haircut appointment and sabi ko malalaman bukas (sunday). Ff to sunday, medyo busy kaming dalawa from duties and errands pero nasa isip ko na talaga na sasamahan ko siya because gusto ko din talaga mag coffee kasama siya na nasabi ko din last last week na nag ccrave ako non. Although, hindi ko pa nasabi sakaniya na sasama ako (1 hr before appointment) i automatically assumed na tatanungin niya naman ako bago siya pumunta don. Pero hindi, galing kasi siya ng errands tas nagchat siya na dun daw muna siya sa coffee shop mag antay ng oras.

So ako naman si tampo na hurt kasi kakasabi ko lang kagabi na I want to spend more time with him kasi bitin yung date namin kagabi and hindi man lang niya ko tinanong bago pumunta don. I felt unheard and not considered ganon. Are my feelings valid or oa na? So yun, as a dire diretsong magsalita kapag galit chinat ko siya about dun na hindi niya pinapakinggan sinasabi ko ganto ganan tas sinabi niya babalik siya at sunduin niya daw ako dito sa house. Ayaw ko ng sumama syempre kasi parang pilit na, ano yun kung hindi sasabihin hindi mo gagawin? Parang ganon. Tas yon, nagkainitian na sa chat (parehas kaming kulang sa tulog kasi late na nakauwi from date) tas sabi niya kung di daw ako lalabas ayaw niya na daw, ititigil niya na ganon. Ako naman na mataas pride at hindi ko siniseryoso kasi never naman siyang nag initiate ng break up, sabi ko sige bahala ka ganto ganan tas yon sabi niya kung ayaw ko ibalik ko nalang mga gamit niya. Ako naman, okay sige binigay ko tas paglabas ko binalik niya din mga gamit at picture ko sakin (na nasa car niya) so ako nashock at di pa medyo nag sink in. Galit at hurt lang naramadam ko that time. Yes, i know ang immature and toxic na nagbreak through chat. 

As of now, hindi ko alam kung anong maffeel ko ba or what kasi 1st time na siya yung nag initiate ng break up and may pag balik ng gamit. So final na ba talaga to? Ganon nalang ba after 8 years? Haha. I messaged him after 4 hours, nag sorry nag thank you ako for the 8 years and no reply. I also realized na baka napagod na siya sa ugali ko kasi lagi akong nagagalit. Is it my fault? Should I get him back?

Hi all, I’m 25 dpp, I pump around 8 times a day (I’ve had to stretch a pump here or there due to having a toddler, newborn, and husband back at work.) I thought I was doing well EBF my baby until his two week apt, when he had lost even more weight from his discharge from the hospital and his pediatrician let me know that at 12% they admit for hospitalization and a feeding tube, and my son was at 9%. I started triple feeding, and saw an LC who did a weighted feed and said his latch was good, but that he was inefficient at pulling milk, and said EBF would probably not work for us, and that my milk may not be nutritious enough for my son. After this appointment, I added in power pumping twice daily as well to up supply. 

I’m currently taking sunflower lecithin, liquid gold from legendairy milk, brewers yeast, drinking a minimum of 100 oz of water, plus two body armors a day, plus other fluids (such as coffee because I need caffeine). I also drink water with liquid IV for electrolytes. I eat oatmeal daily for breakfast, plus I add peanut butter for extra fat and protein. I snack on raw nuts for healthy fats, and drink full fat oatmilk in my coffee everyday. 

I’d say I’m typically producing a little more than my baby needs, he eats about 3 oz every 2 to 3 hours, and I pump about 5 oz every 3 hours, sometimes a little less or more.

I want to make sure my son is gaining weight, and I did get a baby scale (approved by ped), but he’s not gaining during weighted feeds so I’m bottle feeding pumped milk, but his weight gain is very very slow so far. I’m worried it’s my milk content, and would appreciate any suggestions of what I’m not already doing to make sure I am giving my body what it needs to produce nutritious enough milk for my son.

Thank you!

They’re not there to “build bonds” or whatever mushy nonsense the experts spiel; they’re rigged to catch the couples out and spark some juicy drama.

You’re handed a loaded gun and asked question like “What’s your biggest ick about me?” or told to rank the hottest spouse, and suddenly you’re either lying through your teeth or blowing up your fake marriage on national TV. It’s not therapy; it’s a trap.

The producers know exactly what they’re doing, tossing these poor suckers into a pressure cooker and waiting for the meltdown. Look at past seasons: couples who spill their guts get roasted, and the ones who dodge it still look shady. There’s no winning. The best play? Just don’t engage. Sit there, sip your coffee, and let the experts yap. Playing along is like handing them the script for your villain edit, every word’s a soundbite waiting to bite you back.

I originally was going to list my entire shops tool inventory as I feel its small enough to do so and not have the list be too long. However, I think I would rather ask you what you found to be the best investments into your shop you feel have the greatest value. Or what things you've done/added that you now couldn't dream of working without? 

  
I currently have a shop in an 8x10 resin shed that I am moving into a room in my basement so that I can actually do leatherwork when it's 0 F. For work stations I have a 4x4 pressboard coffee table with cutting mat, an old pressboard desk as a dye station. I also have a husky ""toolbox"" that's 36"" with a metal pegboard and a couple shelves and open storage below and a US general from Harbor Freight that has a 1"" wide belt sander and a vise bolted to the top. It's also full of tools for diesel service.... so IDK if it's even worth trying to lug that one into the basement just for an additional workstation. Let me know what your thoughts are on that.

  
For tools I have the basics from cutting to edge finishing. I can make simple wallets and have a very basic tooling/stamp kit. I don't have any sort of machines other than a small Dremel rotary tool. I have a max $1000USD budget. I was considering spending $400 to build a 2x4 workbench and maybe a 8x4 cutting table and then the remaining $600 on new tools or tool upgrades.

I utilized reddit so much when researching so I thought it would be helpful if I posted my own experience including pricing (FOR TWO PEOPLE) on everything. Its definitely not a cheap place to visit but honestly very comparable to a big city in the US so we weren't that surprised. We went in March and the weather was perfect. 70-80's no rain, minimal wind. We stayed at Airbnb's and felt very safe and comfortable (with the exception of a few bugs here and there).

La Fortuna: 

* Sunday: 
   * Land in san Jose, pick up car (Expedia), $500 
   * La Casita Cafe - Atenas $26 dollars - halfway between San Jose and La Fortuna. 
      * Incredible views, really refreshing juices, good service. 
      * Recommend going in the AM or early afternoon to give yourself at least 2 hours before the sun sets to leave and get to La Fortuna with sunlight. The roads to this restaurant were windy and at times very steep up-hill. Would not recommend doing it at night. 

* Monday: 
   * 8:00 AM- Mistico hanging bridges guided tour - $108 total 
   * Lunch at organico cafe $67
   * 11 AM - Arenal 1968 trail - $52 dollars no guide 
   * Dinner downtown La Fortuna - $60
* Tuesday:
   * Breakfast at red frog cafe $25 dollars 
      * Really good coffee and incredible breakfast
   * La fortuna waterfall $40
      * 500 steps down and up, we were able to swim in the waterfall which was so nice and refreshing! There is another area where you can swim downstream of the waterfall. Highly recommend it. 
   * Baldi hot springs -$132 total - hot springs and food 
      * Do not recommend it for a couple (Tabacon is a better and more luxurious experience from what we heard). Baldi would be a good spot if you have kids. They have waterslides and a whole section for kids.  Did not feel clean. If you do end up going, I'd skip the buffet., it was 2/10 experience. Felt like we were eating jail food. $10 dollar deposit for towels. $7 dollars non refundable for a locker. 
      * El Choyin - free hot springs by Tabacon. It was lovely! Would have loved to spend more time here. Felt clean and safe. Had to pay a parking guy $10 and he said he would watch out car and belongings. Parking is on the side of the street and then they direct you to where the stream is. You basically have to go down this rocky path and you'll see the hot springs. 



* Wednesday: 

* 8 AM: Coffee and chocolate tour with northfields - $82 dollars 
   * SO worth it!
* Head to Monteverde
* Cafe macadamia 49$
   * INCREDIBLE views, really delicious food. Great way to break up the drive. 

Monteverde: 

* Wednesday: 
   * Arrive in monteverde 
   * Gas 50$
   * Sunset watching across from CPI spanish immersion school. Lots of locals and tourists gather here to watch the sunset. We took some snacks and drinks there and had a great time.  FREE
   * Dinner: Hotel Belmar $72
      * Food was 5/10, drinks and vibes 10/10.

* Thursday: 
   * Stella’s for breakfast -  26$
   * Zip lining with 100% aventura 8AM-11 AM - 143 USD
      * About 10 different zip lines with a tarzan swing at the end. Really fun! If you have a fear of heights this is not for you. 
      * Carretera a Reserva de Monteverde, Provincia de Puntarenas, Santa Elena, Costa Rica, Costa Rica 60109
      * Free 24 hour cancellation 
   * Lunch at cafe orchid  $40
   * Bat museum without a tour $12
   * Sunset at Cerro Pinocho 
      * 2$ for parking
      * Cerro Pinocho is an incredible place to watch the sunset, it's about 20 minutes from Monteverde, it's this incredibly nice man's backyard where he basically allows people to come and watch the sunset. I’ve heard that he sometimes passes out free coffee for people. He seemed so genuine and nice. It was truly one of the best sunsets I've ever seen. He charges $2 dollars for parking and entrance. If you don't want to pay, you can stop a few meters before the Cerro Pinocho and still will have a lovely spot to watch the sunset. Saw a lot of locals do that. 
   * Morphea cafe $49
      * We went at night, overall food was good, service was good. 
* Friday: 
   * 730 AM: Hiking the cloud forest $70 for tour 57 for entrance and parking   
      * Do NOT recommend THREE BROTHERS TOUR - we booked last minute but our guide was not very knowledgeable.  
   * Stella’s $36
   * Hotel Belmar drinks $32
   * Tramonti for dinner - $57.5
      * Highly recommend going during sunset for the views. 
* Saturday: 
   * Drive to san jose 
   * Gas - 27$

* We didn’t take any cash before leaving, we ended up getting $20 dollars worth of colones at the ATM at San Jose. We were charged an $8 dollar fee. To avoid this, get it done at a bank before you leave for your trip!
* We found that most places accepted cards so the $20 was more than enough for us. We used it on tolls on the way from San Jose to La fortuna (they didn't accept card at the toll station so something to keep in mind). We used the rest on souvenirs at the end of our trip. 
* We felt incredibly safe the entire time we were there, the locals were SO friendly and helpful. The Pura Vida lifestyle made sense!
* We were there for 7 nights and split our time between Monteverde and La fortuna, I think it was a perfect balance and honestly recommend spending at least 2-3 days in each place. I keep reading that Monteverde is overrated, it’s not and was worth every minute that we spent there. I can’t wait to go back! 
* We signed up for basic coverage at Expedia - honestly recommend it because the roads can get a little rough and god forbid something happens, it's nice to know you have some coverage. We never ended up needing it but had peace of mind that we were safe just in case. 
* We were told to get Waze but google maps worked just fine. I would download it just in case. 
* We drank tap water everywhere and did well! It's really fresh and tasted great. 
* Highly highly highly encourage guided tours at some of the forests (cloud forest, mistico hanging bridges). The guide points out things you would completely miss if you were to just walk through these areas. They also carry around a telescope to zoom in on birds, snakes, insects, etc. Really felt like I was able to appreciate the forest better with the guide. It's worth it! 
* Some places we would have loved to go if we had more time - el tigre waterfall, la piedra del indio waterfalls (its on the way from La Fortuna to Monteverde so it would be a nice place to stop and do the hike which is about 3 hours long). 
* A lot of things can be booked while you're in Costa Rica so don't feel obligated to have everything done before going. I would definitely book hot springs early though because those sell out fast (Expect for Baldi). We also found that our Airbnb hosts got discounts and were able to set up tickets for us pretty easily.

**Original Post: My daughter wants me to rename her!**  
Subreddit Flair for the post: Name Change

My 18 year old daughter came out as a transgender woman. My husband and I have been 100% supportive (and I very much welcome another girl in the house — she has 3 brothers!). She expressed initially that she was comfortable going by her birth name, as it is gender neutral, but after turning 18 and getting ready for college, she’s decided she needs a new name. And, she wants me to choose it! She says that she still wants to be named by her mama. I melted.🥹

I come seeking ideas! Her only parameter is that it’s nothing that “seems like she renamed herself”; by this I’m assuming more ‘out there’ names are out. It’s such a challenge picking a name for someone you already know so well, and not a newborn!

She’s incredibly intelligent, bookish, shy but spunky, and a total sweetheart. Gorgeous, curly red hair and freckles. We are a family of Jewish-Irish descent and her brothers are Lev, Raphael ‘Raf’ and Elias. I never had girl names picked out, as I found out later in the game.

Do any names come to mind with this description? Her middle name will be Miriam (family name). Thank you in advance!

**Top Comments:**

(Editor's note: I highly recommend you read the comments and the discourse, at least the top voted ones. A lot of people being supportive, and coming up with appropriate, beautiful names for OOP's daughter. And name nerdery, as is appropriate for the sub).

A helpful Redditor said:

>Don't have any name suggestions yet but wanted to quickly say I love this post and wish you best of luck finding a beautiful name

>How incredibly touching 🥹

>Naomi Miriam – A timeless Hebrew name meaning “pleasantness.”

>Esther Miriam – A strong, classic Jewish name with historical significance.

>Clara Miriam – A bookish, vintage name that feels sophisticated yet warm.

>Maeve Miriam – A beautiful Irish name meaning “intoxicating” with a strong history.

>Talia Miriam – A lovely Hebrew name meaning “gentle dew from heaven.”

>Fiona Miriam – An Irish name meaning “fair,” fitting her red hair and freckles.

>Sylvie Miriam – A delicate yet intelligent-sounding name of French and Jewish origin.

>Daphne Miriam – A literary and nature-inspired name with a graceful touch.

>Lena Miriam – Simple, elegant, and effortlessly classic.

>To not seem like she renamed herself, I would suggest names that were ranking in the year she was born.

>Suggestions:

>Alicia

>Caitlin

>Callie

>Keira

>Phoebe

>Nadia

>Natalie

OP's reply:

>Good thinking! Keira is lovely.

Another Redditor asked:

>Did you have any baby names picked out for a girl when you were pregnant with your boys? Personally, I love traditional names. I’d go with something along the lines of Ruth, Rachel, or Anna.

>Wanting to be named by her mama :’) that really made my day.

OP's reply:

>I did not! I found out about my pregnancies fairly late into the game so it was never really a question.

A Redditor asked:

>What about your middle name, Mama?? This entire post brings me joy!!!

OP's reply:

>I will be passing on mine (and my mom’s) middle name for her middle. Miriam. 😆

Subreddit Flair: Story

Let’s preface this by saying that this will be long and mushy. I took this very, very seriously and would love to share the experience. Feel free to skip to the bottom for the name reveal (sharing with her full blessing!)

First of all, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the outpouring of support. The love far outweighed the hate, and we were absolutely awestruck by the support. I still have quite a few private messages to get through, but please know that I will read each and every one of them and do my best to respond!

I got quite a few comments asking why I would post to Reddit when my daughter asked ME to name her. The answer is that I’m simply not a very creative person, and trying to come up with a name from scratch is so, so hard! I haven’t named a baby in 16 years and we have an enormous family - ie, difficult to think of names that we love AND aren’t taken. I came here for inspiration and received more than I could’ve ever wished for!

Going about choosing was incredibly difficult, but I eventually got my list down to a top 3. They needed to past a few tests. 1. Does the name suit her? 2. Would 2006 me have chosen this name? 3. Does it sound out of whack with her brothers’ names? And most importantly… does she love it?

I brought the top 3 to her and she said “Mom, this is defeating the purpose. I don’t want to choose!” So, I had another idea. We would have 3 little coffee/lunch dates around the city and use a different name to order with, so she could feel each name out and see if any of them were definitive no’s. That ruled out Talia - gorgeous name, but didn’t feel quite right to her. Aviva was also a top contender that didn’t make the cut.

I mulled over the final two for what seems like years… but I chose, and she expressed that it was secretly her favorite too! It felt like divine intervention to be in this situation, considering this name, with Purim so close.

I am the incredibly proud mama of Esther Miriam! I absolutely love it, and so does she. “Essie May” evolved as a nickname from her father overnight, and it made me fall in love even more. May was the nickname of her namesake and she happens to be a May baby. Esther also has immense meaning to us as Jews, and I can absolutely say that 2006 me would’ve chosen it. The runner-up was Naomi.

I could not have done it without this forum. Thank you all so very much for sharing this with me. ❤️

To the point I would feel extremely sick. 

Hi! I haven’t posted here before but this is something I’ve been struggling with recently. I’ve always had a weird relationship with food - the dichotomy of forgetting to eat all day (adhd struggle is real) and also being a stress/boredom eater. For most of my adult life I had been around 180-190lbs (5’8 24f) until 2022 when I started smoking weed and ended up going down a really extreme binge eating rabbit hole. I’ve always struggled with cravings, which to an extent I think is normal especially during a certain time of the month, but with smoking all self control was out the window. 

During the binge eating period, I’d weigh 210-215lbs. I recently quit smoking back in January and have felt sooo much more in control of my health and eating habits, but I had a weigh in at the doctor and I was shocked to see I was 225lbs!

My eating habits now include mostly home cooked meals (often from scratch) like egg and cheese quesadillas, pasta or pizza from scratch, veggie + rice bowl. I don’t eat fast food anymore except occasionally subway or cava. If I eat a snack it’s usually fruit or cheese unless I’m craving some sweets (which is now closer to 1-2x per week instead of eating half my weight’s worth of calories in ice cream every night…that is sadly not an exaggeration). I also started eating chicken and turkey again after being pescatarian for 10+ years. And I do still enjoy coffee type drinks daily (sometimes eating out and sometimes at home) which I know can have a lot of sugar, but I’m still eating wayyy less sugar and calories overall. 

I also started doing yoga 1-3x week back in November since my job involves standing all day and I experience joint pain from my weight. Whereas before I would mayyybe hit the gym a couple times a month. I know I have the body composition that gains muscle extremely easy and I’m wondering if the added protein I’ve been eating has been contributing to sleeper build gains?? Because I feel like my clothes still fit the same, maybe slightlyyy tighter. 

So what gives? Is there something I’m doing wrong or is it just too early to be seeing physical results? I will say my mental health and energy levels have been better than ever, I’m just feeling discouraged about my physical health.

Kitchener was drowning in fear. Five murders in two months. No forced entry. No witnesses. Just a single red thread left on each victim’s chest. The media called him The Phantom Butcher. I called him my worst nightmare.

My name’s Loki. I grew up here, in Kitchener, where the streets were safe, and the nights were quiet. It was a simple life—me and my brother Rhay, always getting into trouble, but nothing too serious. We were close—too close, I guess. It was supposed to be a normal life, until Rhay disappeared.

Fifteen years ago.

One day, he was with me, laughing, sharing the usual stupid jokes. And the next day, he was gone. No explanation. No goodbye. Just a hole where my brother used to be. I was a kid, and I couldn’t make sense of it. My parents thought he ran away—maybe he was just a lost soul who couldn’t deal with life. But I knew better. I couldn’t accept that. Rhay wouldn’t leave me like that. Something had happened, and I wasn’t going to stop searching until I found him.

I became a detective, thinking maybe the answers I found in other people’s missing pieces would lead me to him. But as the years went on, I learned to live with the idea that Rhay was gone. Maybe he was dead. Maybe he was lost. But I stopped looking. Until…

The murders began.

Five bodies in two months. No one saw the killer. No one heard anything. The crime scenes were clean—almost too clean. But the one thing that stood out at every scene was the same: a single red thread placed carefully on each victim’s chest. A signature that sent chills down my spine.

I thought I was chasing shadows. I thought the killer was just a man, a sick mind playing a twisted game. But when I found the red thread in my own house, I realized—this was something personal.

I checked every lock. Every window. Nothing was broken, nothing was forced. The thread had been placed there on purpose. And then I heard it.

A creak.

From my bedroom.

I moved quietly, every step slow, measured, as if I could hear my heart beating in my ears. My fingers curled tightly around my gun as I stepped closer. The door to my room creaked open.

And there, standing in the shadows by my nightstand, was the face I thought I’d never see again.

It was Rhay.

The same brother I lost fifteen years ago. The same brother I had mourned like he was dead. But there he was—alive, twisted, a stranger wearing his face.

“You look surprised,” he whispered, tilting his head. “Miss me?”

I froze. It was him. It couldn’t be. The brother who disappeared—who I thought was gone forever. But now… he was standing right there. And his eyes weren’t the same. There was something dark behind them now. Something I didn’t recognize.

“Rhay…” I barely managed to say. “What the hell happened to you?”

He smiled, a cruel grin that made my stomach turn. “You weren’t supposed to find me. But you did. And now…” He paused, stepping closer, his voice growing colder. “Now, I have to finish what I started.”

Before I could react, he lunged at me, blade flashing in the low light. I barely dodged it, the sharp edge slicing through the air. We crashed to the floor, fists flying. My head slammed into the ground, pain shooting up my spine.

“You think I just vanished?” he spat. “You think I left because I wanted to?” His hands were on my throat now, squeezing, and for a moment, everything went black.

I fought back, desperation flooding through me. I kicked him off, finally getting some space. But when I reached for my gun, it was too late. He snatched it from the floor, the cold steel of the barrel pressed against my forehead.

“You left me,” he said, his voice trembling with rage. “You left me in that hellhole for fifteen years. You never came to find me. You didn’t care.”

His finger was on the trigger. The pressure was unbearable.

“You were supposed to find me,” he whispered. “But now, I’m the one who’s going to find you.”

He pulled the trigger—

Click.

Empty.

In that instant, I hit him with everything I had, slamming my fist into his throat. He staggered back, gasping. I took advantage of his momentary weakness and tackled him onto the coffee table, the glass shattering beneath us.

He was bleeding. But the twisted grin never left his face.

“You fight just like Dad,” he muttered, blood dribbling from his mouth. “Too bad he still died. Just like you will.”

My hands shook as I grabbed him by the collar, pulling him close. “You’re under arrest,” I growled.

He laughed, a sound that rattled my bones. “You think this ends with me?” he whispered, his eyes dark and wild. “You think I’m the only one?”

Before I could answer, he twisted free, running for the window.

I fired.

But he was gone.

All that was left was a single red thread, draped over the shattered glass.

This wasn’t over.

My parents have always been a bit dysfunctional. They both agreed on traditional ideals and in some ways I hear them but in others I wish they would go through with divorcing like they threaten each other to every other minute. It really shows. My mom is a chronic cheater who also abused those in the house hold and my dad is the breadwinner who is coping with alcohol and can’t stand having his convenience altered hence why they’ll separate and he would take her back despite literally all of my siblings and I not liking her. I can tell they’re miserable but I don’t want to be. 

I had to move back home last year due to being laid off work. That’s a whole other story honestly, but I ended up being unemployed. 

I started a new job recently…Of fucking course once that starts, shit hits the fan again. My parents got into an argument again and my dad kicked my mom out, was even seeming like making an effort to commit to that choice. I honestly didn’t mind it. I was happy that my abuser wasn’t under our roof anymore. I filled in the gap of holding down the fort the day she was gone. Truly I don’t see what she didn’t like about being at home give or take how one could feel stir crazy. I was legit happy, I could be honest with my dad without him going “she’s your mom.” Even though she betrayed him countless times. 

Anyways. That lasted for a day and he gave her the new code to the house. Getting that text that she was back made me sick to my stomach. It honestly pisses me off when I can see my dad choosing convenience over safety each and every time. It threw me back to when it happened the first time and I was 13-14 years old. My dad was so close to getting full custody because there was documentation for her behaviour and my older sibling and I were both old enough to voice ourselves legally albiet both parents agreed to not drag us into it. 

Fast forward to recently. One night after I finished my shift, my siblings and my dad picked me up from work. Clearly, my dad was quite *cheerful* and he wasn’t afraid to show it. He offered me a little bit of what helped h him but I just said I’ll wait till we got home. On the way home, he and the sibling driving were joking around. He then took it too far and was jokingly reaching over to the wheel, we lightly swerved over a little bit but my sibling was able to correct it, but too late, my heart was pounding, I kept my eyes shut and my other sibling was holding my hand. I had a really bad car accident a few years back and honestly I still am dealing with lingering fears around it, I haven’t driven much since. 

My dad just couldn’t understand why I didn’t like that, why I was freaking out, yet he deals with the same demon from a completely different hell. He should understand. 

This man expects me to pacify my mother via getting her coffee, or whatever else, or just to agree with everything she says. He also expects me to babysit her whenever I’m at home. Hell no, they’re both grown, I’m not getting involved. My mother constantly plays the victim herself and I have long since accepted that she and I will never see eye to eye save for maybe daughterly love I hold on my end. Yet she is the one who was physically abusing me through the years because I’m disabled and was a little shit who didn’t know how to properly cope with all I was dealing with on my plate yet. She stopped once I got old enough to fight back. 

I left home before for similar reasons and this is showing me time and time again that this cycle will continue. I just feel so fucking guilty at the same time. I want to take a flight with my cat and get away, granted it wouldn’t be an easy feat once on the other side. Idk I’m just all over the place honestly. I know this isn’t healthy but I also feel bad because I know they love me. 

TL;DR: my family, particularly my parents are being massively dysfunctional and I want to leave. I feel guilty to do so though.

We’ve got gods, we’ve got heroes, but where’s Alexander the Great? I mean, come on, the guy conquered half the known world before most of us even finish our morning coffee.

Imagine this: his ultimate ability could be a full-on cavalry charge, something like Guan Yu’s, but with a twist—maybe his troops follow him into battle, dealing AoE damage and stunning enemies in their path. Or perhaps he could summon a phalanx formation for some epic crowd control. Alexander would fit perfectly alongside legendary heroes like Hercules and Achilles, bringing some serious tactical vibes to the roster.

And for his first ability? Picture this: Battle Cry of Conquest. Alexander blows his horn, inspiring nearby allies and boosting their movement speed by 20% and attack speed by 15% for a few seconds. As a bonus, enemies within range would suffer reduced defense for a short time, demoralized by the powerful sound. It’s a perfect nod to his role as a battlefield leader, and it’d be an awesome way to shake up team fights.

So, what do you think? Would Alexander fit into the Smite 2 pantheon? And if so, what kind of abilities would you give him? Let’s brainstorm and maybe, just maybe, the devs will hear us out!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We have both been incredibly busy for the past few days (her doing her bachelor's and I'm doing my Master's). However, I felt something was off since I've asked her to have food with me or grab coffee for the past 4-5 days. She always says no, saying she's busy or she wants to eat in, which I found valid.

However, I did kinda feel like something was off. I wasn't addressing it because frankly the past 2-3 months have been simply chaotic for me (family member got a surgery, broke up with my ex boyfriend, financial issues...) and she's been there for me through it. I don't throw it at her, I simply tell her and ask for advice every now and then because she expresses genuine interest. 

However, I think I should've seen things coming. When I broke up with my boyfriend, I was crying my eyes out for hours in the living room. She texts me and asks where am I then joins. When I told her what happened and that I cried and it was emotional, well, she kinda laughed it off. She didn't ask me if I was okay. She didn't ask me how I'm feeling. But hey, she saw it was toxic so she maybe was just relieved.

Fast forward to yesterday when I asked her to hang out and she said she's hanging out with her guy best friend. I said okay, enjoy! I wasn't hurt she didn't invite me because frankly I felt like that guy hated my guts (you'll find out I was right and find out why in a bit). However, I soon realized that the entire friend group was hanging out and I wasn't invited. It did sting but I brushed it off.

A few hours ago, I text her asking her what's wrong. I expressed concern about our friendship and was wondering where I went wrong. She asked me where I was. I told her I'm working close by. Then, she sends this:

""
We aren't okay. I am not saying this to hurt you or anything, but at the same time, I don't want to pretend. I also don't want to share or explain anything to you, nor am I expecting anything from you. I asked where you were because it's late. It's really late. I checked everywhere, but you weren’t there. I was going to text you to ask if you were safe.
""

So I immediately ask her to meet. She, at first, said she's done with the friendship but she still cares about me. She didn't want to tell me the reason she's ending our friendship. I was shaking at this point out of anxiety because I genuinely had no idea where I went wrong. Then she proceeds to say this: I don't trust you anymore. I feel like everything you say contradicts itself. You even told our fommon friend something personal about your dating life and you told her not to tell me. I feel like you don't care about me and your stories always don't add up. I see something and then you go on and explain it in a completely different light. You keep giving excuses by saying you're just being a nice person.

This genuinely made me more confused. I tried probing, but she refused to explain. Then I told her I genuinely don't understand what you're saying and I just want to get it so I never do the same mistakes with you or anyone else. She goes on and lists these as instances:

1. During Christmas, she invited me to hang out with her friends and boyfriend (apparently the initial plan was spending it with her boyfriend but felt bad for me because I'm not close to anyone else here). So we go out, and on the way there we meet a few friends I know (not close, but acquaintances). We were all taking the metro to go to the same area, but the metro was SO FULL. So, because I felt bad for leaving the acquaintances behind (they don't know each other so it was awkward) I told my roommate and her friends to go ahead and wait for me at the exit of the metro station when they get there. Once I got to the area, I called my friend and she says ""oh! We were so hungry so we walked to the restaurant and we are ordering food."" I was pissed but I let it go. The area isn't safe btw at night, so the acquaintances walked me to the restaurant. Out of courtesy, I asked them if they wanted to join us for food. They did. After, we all walked around then went to a coffee shop. During that time, I interacted with my friend's friends but I also spent quite a lot of time with the acquaintances since they didn't know the rest (I admit this is my fault, I should've spent more time with everyone). When we got to the coffee shop, all was good and we all played games together. Later on, I asked her what was wrong because she was being cold and she said I'm spending too much time with them and it's rude. I explained my situation and my thought process, and all was good.

2. A friend of ours broke his ankle. A few days ago, me, the broken ankle dude, G and A all went out. G and A have history, but all was dandy. However, when we were walking around, G and A would always walk ahead alone. Now, the broken ankle guy couldn't walk fast obviously, so I stayed with him and talked about life. Later on, I was joking around with G and she said that ""oh you and broken ankle guy are hitting it off! You were together all the time!"" So, jokingly, I said , ""well you and A were walking together too and left us alone. Haha it's funny..."". G kinda took it personally. Later, I talked to my friend about this and told her honestly it isn't my fault that I was alone with the guy because A and G kept walking away. Even when they do stop for us to catch up with them, they'd start walking too fast again, so we wouldn't be able to match their pace. It did kind of annoy me because it felt like the blame was being put on me.

3. We went hiking 2 weeks back. Again, out of a group of 7, 4 of us were behind because one guy was very slow and nervous, so we stayed with him. At some point, we got separated. Me and this guy ended up walking up the hill alone. At some point, he was like ""oh I wanna try this"" and did a stupid stunt. I admit, I should've stopped him, but in the moment I didn't really think because I was about to do the same thing after him. When the rest found out, they got really mad at me for not telling them. The thing is, the injury wasn't bad at all. We just needed 10-15 minutes to rest and clean things up. Anyway, they did eventually come back to help and despite the bruises, everything was fine. We did take him to the hospital just in case. at that point, my friend was pissed at me for not calling them and telling them what's happening. She kept saying we had other plans too and you dismissed them and didn't think of us. Tbh, in that moment, I was freaking out because of the guy's injury and was just overwhelmed so didn't think straight. He also said that he just needed a few minutes then he'll be able to walk.

4. This friend/roommate had a really nasty fight with a girl 4 years ago. Last year, a close guy friend of mine started dating her. He really wanted us to meet. After saying no a few times, I agreed to hang out for a coffee. We sat for 45ish minutes and I left. I never mentioned it to my roommate until she asked me about the girl. I said that the guy is a good friend of mine and he just wanted me to meet his girlfriend. I told her we aren't friends, we aren't following each other on socials, we don't have each other's numbers, I never saw her after that....etc. I apologized for being insensitive but told her I had no intention of making her a friend, I just wanted to make my close friend happy.

Now, today, what came out was all of this once again. She kept saying I'm contradicting myself, and my assumption is what she means is that what she perceives is very different from what I say. I get that. I can't really explain everything I do, but I did nothing out of bad intention. She kept telling me it's time for me to grow up and be mature.

Her arguments about the situations were the following: 1. Why did you spend so much time with the guy when you were with us? It's like you're a competely different person in groups. When we're 1-on-1, you give me all the attention and love. But when we're in a group, you tend to stick to one person who you don't even know well. 2. She said that I told G that I wasnt pissed off at her for hanging out with A but I told my roommate that I was. I clearly told both of them that it's funny now but in the moment when they blamed me I got pissed because I didn't think it was my fault. She also said ""you tell G stuff and tell her not to tell me."" I swear to God I have no idea what she's talking about. My roommate is one of my closest and if anything she knows the most about me. 3. She was pissed I didn't consider the others since they had dinner plans and did not inform them of the injury when it happened. 4. She was so upset I didn't consider her feelings about hanging out with that girl. She said I didn't even tell her or ask her and I was inconsiderate. She also said that ""I would never do that. When your ex reached out and wanted to hang out, I clearly said no because I value you and don't want to hurt you."" This made no sense because my ex is someone she despised anyway and also, he's an ex, not a random person I'm only meeting once.

Last thing: she said she didn't want to keep being fake. She said she felt bad because she's been shit talking behind my back to our common friend, her guy best friend, and her boyfriend. It's been going on for a while apparently, which really does explain why her guy friend hates my guts (shoots weirdest stares all the time and avoids me when I try talking to him) and her boyfriend gives me weird reactions when I say anything. Also, we speak different native languages and I've picked up on her talking shit about me to her boyfriend on the phone a few times (she knows all my close friends speak her native language but I don't think she knew I can understand snippets). 

I don't know what to do. She said she cares about me still but doesn't want to create a toxic environment as we are roommates. She wanted to get it off her chest and end the friendship because she kept saying we have very different ways of leading life and we don't understand each other. She also kept saying you are not there for me when I need you and you abandon me. That just confused me. I was there on call for hours during her break up even though we weren't close, I was there during doctor appointments, I was there when her family situation was horrible, and I helped her out with everything I could. I'm just so confused. I'm not trying to compare the way we give and love, because she's been there for me at times too.

I'm just so incredibly confused. I think we have different ways of expressing and living our lives and communicating, but it also makes me hurt that she never expressed the concerns or how severe things have been. I don't know what to do. I've been walking around for hours because I feel so bad and I don't know how I can walk in and face her now.

I want genuine advice and criticism if necessary. I want to understand what I did and how I can work around it. I want to try to fix the friendship, but even if that doesn't work, I want to understand how to never make these mistakes again.",1,1742174860.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Tbh, in that moment, I was freaking out because of the guy's injury and was just overwhelmed so didn't think straight. He also said that he just needed a few minutes then he'll be able to walk.

4. This friend/roommate had a really nasty fight with a girl 4 years ago. Last year, a close guy friend of mine started dating her. He really wanted us to meet. After saying no a few times, I agreed to hang out for a coffee. We sat for 45ish minutes and I left. I never mentioned it to my roommate until she asked me about the girl. I said that the guy is a good friend of mine and he just wanted me to meet his girlfriend. I told her we aren't friends, we aren't following each other on socials, we don't have each other's numbers, I never saw her after that....etc. I apologized for being insensitive but told her I had no intention of making her a friend, I just wanted to make my close friend happy.

Now, today, what came out was all of this once again. She kept saying I'm contradicting myself, and my assumption is what she means is that what she perceives is very different from what I say. I get that. I can't really explain everything I do, but I did nothing out of bad intention. She kept telling me it's time for me to grow up and be mature.

Her arguments about the situations were the following: 1. Why did you spend so much time with the guy when you were with us? It's like you're a competely different person in groups. When we're 1-on-1, you give me all the attention and love. But when we're in a group, you tend to stick to one person who you don't even know well. 2. She said that I told G that I wasnt pissed off at her for hanging out with A but I told my roommate that I was. I clearly told both of them that it's funny now but in the moment when they blamed me I got pissed because I didn't think it was my fault. She also said ""you tell G stuff and tell her not to tell me."" I swear to God I have no idea what she's talking about. My roommate is one of my closest and if anything she knows the most about me. 3. She was pissed I didn't consider the others since they had dinner plans and did not inform them of the injury when it happened. 4. She was so upset I didn't consider her feelings about hanging out with that girl. She said I didn't even tell her or ask her and I was inconsiderate. She also said that ""I would never do that. When your ex reached out and wanted to hang out, I clearly said no because I value you and don't want to hurt you."" This made no sense because my ex is someone she despised anyway and also, he's an ex, not a random person I'm only meeting once.

Last thing: she said she didn't want to keep being fake. She said she felt bad because she's been shit talking behind my back to our common friend, her guy best friend, and her boyfriend. It's been going on for a while apparently, which really does explain why her guy friend hates my guts (shoots weirdest stares all the time and avoids me when I try talking to him) and her boyfriend gives me weird reactions when I say anything. Also, we speak different native languages and I've picked up on her talking shit about me to her boyfriend on the phone a few times (she knows all my close friends speak her native language but I don't think she knew I can understand snippets). 

I don't know what to do. She said she cares about me still but doesn't want to create a toxic environment as we are roommates. She wanted to get it off her chest and end the friendship because she kept saying we have very different ways of leading life and we don't understand each other. She also kept saying you are not there for me when I need you and you abandon me. That just confused me. I was there on call for hours during her break up even though we weren't close, I was there during doctor appointments, I was there when her family situation was horrible, and I helped her out with everything I could. I'm just so confused. I'm not trying to compare the way we give and love, because she's been there for me at times too.

I'm just so incredibly confused. I think we have different ways of expressing and living our lives and communicating, but it also makes me hurt that she never expressed the concerns or how severe things have been. I don't know what to do. I've been walking around for hours because I feel so bad and I don't know how I can walk in and face her now.

I want genuine advice and criticism if necessary. I want to understand what I did and how I can work around it. I want to try to fix the friendship, but even if that doesn't work, I want to understand how to never make these mistakes again.",1,1742174701.0,friendship,0,1.0,False

1jd15wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimReaderRealm/comments/1jd15wf/grandpas_secret_lived_in_the_basement_another/,Grandpa’s secret lived in the basement (another submission from me),"It was during the spring break of my second year at college that I got a phone call from my uncle Andrew, asking me if I’d be willing to spend a few days over at his house. My grandfather had been sick for a long, tough while, and it’d apparently gotten to the stage that the primary focus now was less so to treat him and more so to just make him as comfortable as possible for the time he had left.

I can’t say I envied anyone in the situation – Grandpa, who’d be getting ready to face eternity in a house that wasn’t his, with no company but a son who he barely spoke to these days, and Andrew, who’s girlfriend died giving birth to their daughter seven months ago and was now tasked with taking care of a dying man on top of that. I’d like to act as if I was making a saintly decision to come over and offer a helping hand out of love for my family, but the truth was that it had been quite some time since I’d spoken to Andrew last, and it had been… forever since I’d spoken to my paternal grandfather. No, I went because I was lonely, unbearably so. I didn’t have any friends to speak of at college, and ever since my mother passed away about a year ago, I’d had no one to talk to at all. I made the decision to help Andrew out of the desperation for proper social interaction. Not like there’d be much to it, anyway. All I really imagined I’d be doing is keeping the baby out of his hair when he was too busy and getting grandpa anything he needed.

Andrew’s house was out in the sticks, at least forty minutes away from the nearest town. My family are mostly dotted around a generally quite rural county, so there wasn’t much in the area but barren roads and the odd building or two. As for the house itself, there wasn’t really much to say about it from the front yard. Just another isolated double story that someone called home. I rang the doorbell, and after a few moments Andrew greeted me. He seemed more or less the same as the last time I’d seen him in the flesh.

“Ah, Nick, how’re you doing? Thanks so much again for coming”, he smiled, his voice nothing if not welcoming. “Nah, not like I had much going on anyway,” I replied, to which he chuckled. “Come on in, throw you jacket on the hanger there. You want some coffee?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Yeah, alright. Have a seat over in the living room. First door to your left.

I took his invitation and made my way over. Now that I was fully inside, I could see that there was more to Andrews’s house than meets the eye at first. It smelled like old books and something faintly musty, the scent of time that slowly claimed everything. The entryway was wide and dimly lit, with heavy curtains blocking out the daylight. There was a quiet rhythm to the house—the creaking of wood beneath our feet, the soft shuffle of Andrew’s footsteps echoing through long corridors. It had the basic interior of a house a lot older than you’d think it was from outside, with aged patterns across the wallpaper and a somewhat ornate type of miniature chandelier suspended from the ceiling. Clashing with these design decisions was the more minimalist furniture and art pieces hanging from the walls. It seemed like someone had taken these measures in order to give the inside of the building a more modern feel, but really, it was a bandaid on a bullethole.

I looked around after reaching my destination. The living room appeared comfortable enough, with an ever so slightly peeling couch, a worn rug, and shelves of books that didn’t seem to have been touched in years. It was the kind of place that felt frozen in time. A bit musty, but lived-in, as though the walls had absorbed the memories of countless years of family life.

A minute or so later, Andrew entered with two mugs. I sipped mine slowly as we exchanged some admittedly uncomfortable small talk. “God, you look so grown up. It’s been, what, two years?” It’d been at least five. This continued for a while until we got to the tasks that’d be at hand for the next number of days.

“I’ll be picking him up from the hospice tomorrow after work. It’ll probably be close to seven before we’ll be back. Chloe’s upstairs having her nap right now, so I’m gonna go and get started on making dinner. In the meantime, you go ahead and make yourself comfortable. There are two rooms free upstairs, you can take your pick.” He rose and clapped me on the shoulders before heading over to the kitchen. “I really do appreciate it, Nick. It’s been rough having to pay for babysitters.”

After going upstairs, I passed what must’ve been Andrew’s room on the way down the hallway, another chamber masquerading as belonging to a home far younger than was the reality, with a double bed and a child’s cot next to it, the baby sleeping soundly inside. I had a mountain of college assignments to get cracking on, so I’d brought my laptop and sociology textbook in my travel bag. That’s how I spent the majority of the evening, taking an hour’s break for dinner.

We had another fairly awkward conversation about what I’d been getting up to in college (spoilers: fuck all.) From my seat at the dining room table, I was able to look out the window at a filth-coated golden retriever pottering around the yard outside. I hadn’t noticed it before; I was surprised that Andrew was able to manage a dog on top of his life as a single father. As I tried to focus on my pork chops, something else caught my eye. There was a door in the corner of the room that I hadn’t noticed before. A small door, almost entirely hidden behind another old bookshelf. I couldn’t see much of it, but there was something about the door that captured my attention, something in the way the wood seemed to shimmer in the dim light, as though it wasn’t quite real.

“Is that a closet?” I asked, pointing.

Andrew looked over his shoulder and then shook her head quickly. “Oh, that? No, just a small little space in the structure I haven’t really found a use for yet.” He smiled, but it was tight, forced. I was going to ask him more before the dog outside started barking loudly. “God, what’s his problem?” Andrew sighed, exasperated. “Hey, you never mentioned you had a dog. Seems like an awful lot of work for you.” I commented. “Nah, he’s not mine, just some stray that’s been finding the yard lately for whatever reason.” The conversation petered off after that, but I remember thinking that if that was the case, it was odd that the dog had a collar.

I called it a night maybe two hours later, but I had a hard time sleeping because the dog continued to bark periodically until all hours of the morning. In the morning, Andrew was already gone to work when I awoke, but he’d left instructions on the kitchen counter for taking care of Chloe. I’d babysitted before as a teenager, so I could manage things fine, but it never really gets any more enjoyable changing a diaper. Other than that, there’s not much to say about the day other than that I’d tried checking out the door behind the bookshelf out of curiosity and boredom but I’d found it locked. I didn’t really care though, since it sounded like it was nothing more than just a small crawlspace or something.

When Andrew arrived home, wheeling Grandpa with him, I could see for myself just how sick he must have been. He had stage three skin cancer that had by now spread through a terrible amount of the tissue in his torso. Andrew would tell me later on that night that he had two weeks left, tops. The man looked like a skeleton, his complexion beyond wrinkled and pale, his head like a skull with its eyeballs left intact along with a few pointlessly added tufts of snow-white hair. His skin was hanging off of his body so, so loosely, as if the space between had been repeatedly filled with air and then deflated. I’d been hoping I could have at least some sort of conversation with him, since I’d seen him even less in my life than Andrew, but he could barely work a sentence together, mostly just murmuring, grunting and pointing at things to communicate.

The evening ended up being even more uncomfortable than the last, so I spent even more time with the company of my schoolwork, figuring Grandpa would probably prefer to be with his son anyway, especially seeing that as far as I knew, they hardly ever saw each other either. I ended up just going to bed early, Grandpa in the room next door, but of course I was kept up for ages by that stupid dog again.

I ended up spending, I think, another week at Andrew’s, and I’m not gonna recount every day from here on, since it ultimately doesn’t really matter much to where I am now. Andrew had to keep going to work, of course, so it fell to me to keep watch of Chloe, and help Grandpa take his medicine. The only words that he could consistently get out, or perhaps the only ones he cared to were his frequent complaints about the various pains in his body.

“The skin” “My muscles” “The flesh”

I’d heard before, not from my father but from my mother, about how Grandpa didn’t treat him and Andrew very well. He was Vietnam vet, and the war came home with him, rearing its head in the form of a bottle and the abuse that resulted from it. Even in spite of that, I couldn’t help but pity the pain he must have been experiencing for the last few months of his life. All I could do is keep encouraging him to choke down his pills.

During the second night with Grandpa in the house, I was woken up yet again by the incessant barking of the dog outside, After the dog had seemingly fucked off to annoy someone else, I was quickly drifting back to sleep, until I heard Grandpa mumbling something next door. I’d gotten accustomed to his mostly nonsensical mutterings throughout the day, and the house had thin walls, so I didn’t think too much of it, until I heard another voice, speaking back to him. Andrew’s voice, whispering, just audible.

*“No. I’ve told you already, it’s not happening, so get it out of your head.”*

*“You know you have to!”* came Grandpa’s slow response. His voice was like the creaking of an old floorboard, but he sounded far more lucid than I’d ever heard him before.

I don’t remember their conversation continuing beyond that point. I heard the door open softly, then shut again, and I didn’t have enough energy to ponder what I’d heard for long before I fell back asleep.

The next day, I decided to find out from Andrew about it in private.

“Hey, so, sorry if I’m being too nosy here, but I heard you and Grandpa talking about something last night. It sounded like you were arguing?” I asked. He sighed deeply. “Look, you… you’ve probably realised by now that this house is a lot older than you might’ve expected. Truth is it belonged to him – your father and I grew up here. He’s just, well, he’s not happy with how I’ve been running things here, that’s all. You know how older guys are really particular about that sorta thing.” He looked conflicted about what he’d said, and the silence between us was deafening. “Come on, I just managed to get Chloe asleep five minutes ago. Let’s get to bed for tonight.”

I can’t say I was entirely satisfied with that answer, but I could sense Andrew didn’t wish to discuss the matter any further, so I oblige him. On the bright side, there was no barking from the dog that night, or any of the following nights for that matter, so I slept well, at the very least.

I don’t have anything to say about the day after that, other than that the uncomfortable atmosphere in the house was only getting worse. Grandpa spent all of his time alone in his room, just sitting in his wheelchair in the corner, mumbling nonsense to himself – Andrew and I delivering his meals to him, giving him his pills, and sharing some unspoken weight about it all between us.

That night, I was woken up by another argument in Grandpa’s room. Grandpa’s voice was no louder, no more commanding, but I could sense an undeniable rage in it.

*“You’re a fool. You always were. I know what you did last night. You think that’s enough? It has to be me.”*

*“You don’t deserve it. You treated us like dirt!”*

*“IT DOESN’T MATTER IF I DESERVE IT. IT HAS TO BE ME, AND IT HAS TO BE TOMORROW.”*

I didn’t fall back to sleep quickly that time. Actually, I don’t think I got any sleep that night. I didn’t know what any of it meant, but grandpa’s words scared me.

The following day, Grandpa’s door was locked from the inside. Andrew also stayed home from work, and he looked terrible. I knew I had to ask him what happened last night, but I decided to give some space until the evening. I barely saw him all day, to be honest. The only perception I had of him was the tired cooing to Chloe every now and then, the unlocking and relocking of Grandpa’s door as he took his pills every three hours, and a dinner we shared in silence.

In the end, it was he who came to me.

“You heard us last night, didn’t you.”

I nodded.

“Yeah. I guess you deserve to know at least this much. I don’t imagine your parents ever told you before they were gone.” He looked like he was about to either scream or break down in tears. I’m not sure which.

“Your father and I had a younger sister once. Phoebe. I was eight when she was born, your old man eleven.”

My mind raced trying to fit this into my family history. He wasn’t lying, I’d never heard so much as a word of this throughout my life. “She went missing when she was five. Just gone, without a trace. They never found her. Dad started drinking a lot more after that.”

I didn’t know what to say. “That “tomorrow” Dad was talking about is the anniversary of the disappearance. I think the memories just hurt him the most today. They hurt me the worst today too.”

He was crying now. “I’m sorry,” I managed. “I don’t know what to say, I… I’m so sorry. No one ever told me.” Andrew rubbed his eyes, steeling himself. “Look, I’m sorry too. You should never have needed to know, really.” He started heading for the stairs. “I’m gonna try and get some sleep. Please, if you hear anything from him tonight, or if I have to come into him again, just ignore it. Please. It hurts everyone enough as it is.” With that, he headed up to his room, shutting the door behind him.

I was stunned. How much else had I not known about my dad’s side of the family? Even with what I did know now, I was left with more questions than before. It didn’t make sense how the truth about my Dad and Uncle also having a sister could link to everything else I’d overheard between Grandpa and Andrew. Why did it “have to be” Grandpa? What had Andrew done last night? What the hell even was “it”? My mind swam as I laid wide awake in bed that night. I think it was that state of fog in my brain that actually ended up putting me unconscious for a few hours, as it happened. But, one last time, I was awoken from my sleep, but it wasn’t by the barking of a dog, or by voices from Grandpa’s room next door. It was by slow, heavy footsteps, descending the stairs.

I know Andrew told me to ignore anything I might hear that night. To this day, I don’t know what compelled me to leave my room, but I crept out the door quietly, and the first thing I realised is that Grandpa’s door was open, and his room empty. The footsteps continued to pound through the house, into the kitchen, it seemed. I had to know. I had to know the truth to everything that was going on in this house, and I sensed that I was right at the cusp of it. As silently as I could, I too descended the stairs. I followed the noises to the kitchen, and I realised then what I’d been overlooking the whole time, the sight of it filling me with total dread.

The door behind the bookshelf, now wide open.

I abandoned whatever idea of stealth I had left in my head, rushing over to the door, where I found that it wasn’t some sort of small little cupboard or crawlspace at all, it was a flight of stairs, down to what must’ve been a cellar. Why had Andrew lied about this? I flew down the stairs and turned to the cellar door on my right, pressing my ear against it. Deep, heavy, fatigued breathing, and the surface of the door felt almost as if it was vibrating, pulsing with some impossible force. I gripped the door handle, and it felt white hot. My hand turns. The door opens. The truth is revealed.

Andrew was alone in the cellar, illuminated by one dim light bulb hanging from the ceiling, the kitchen knife in hand. No sign of Grandpa anywhere. Andrew barely reacted to my presence. He just kept staring at the wall opposite of him. Only, it wasn’t a wall. Not really.

Where there should have been brick and wallpaper, a pulsating, oozing, red-brown expanse of flesh spanned the side of the cellar ahead of us, the drywall at the edges of the adjacent walls transitioning from plaster and sheet brick into living tissue. The wall heaved, and throbbed, and sweat, somehow horrifically, impossibly given the gift of life. I can’t even begin to describe the smell. The smell was so fucking disgusting.

I could barely think. The sight of it almost made me feel mad, like I had found myself in a bizarre nightmare, any rational thoughts shackled away behind lock and key.

“What the fuck,” I choked. “What the fuck is this?”

“ANDREW! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHERE THE FUCK IS GRANDPA?”

He turned around, seemingly broken out of a trance. He stared back at the wall for a second. “He was right,” I heard him say, more to himself than to me. He turned back. “He was right. It had to be done.”

I glanced back around him to the putrid fleshy mass before my eyes. No. He couldn’t mean that.

“No. Andrew, where’s Grandpa? What have you done?” I begged, denying to myself what I knew had transpired.

Andrew glanced back at the wall again for few moments. He had a look of almost reverence etched across his face. He faced me for a second, madness twinkling in his eyes. “It’s what he wanted.”

“No! You’re lying!” I roared, not believing myself one bit. “WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THIS?”

He didn’t look away from the wall of flesh. “I inherited it, I suppose.

“It had to be done, you know. It’s what he wanted.”

The wall suddenly flexed outward grotesquely, emitting a low grumbling sound. Try as I did to deny it to myself in the moment, I knew what that must have meant, as I saw a look of concern flash across Andrew’s face. It was hungry again, needed to be fed soon. Clearly, Grandpa wasn’t a filling meal. Amidst the grumbling, we could both suddenly hear a high-pitched noise, piercing through it.

Chloe, crying from upstairs.

Andrew stared up at the ceiling, then back over to me.

“Don’t,” I whispered, but he was already charging towards the door. “Andrew, don’t!” He shoved hard against me as I tried to block him from getting out of the door. I threw myself against him with everything I had, tried to wrestle the knife from his grip, but he was far stronger than he looked, overpowering me quickly and slashing my right leg. I howled in shock and pain.

“You know what?” He hissed, throwing me to the ground and grabbing me by my legs as I gushed blood. “This is even better. You’re of far more use anyway.” I realised in an instant what he meant as he dragged me towards the wall of flesh.

“No,” I choked. “No Andrew please God I-” my words were cut off as I became almost entirely immersed in the writhing, living mass. Tendrils wrapped around me, almost painlessly puncturing through my skin, *connecting* to me. For a few brief, passing moments, I had the notion that I was linking, fusing to the grand, biological system of the wall, that soon all would be alive, all would be connected, before my mind went black.

After an unknowable length of time, I grew more and more aware of my surroundings once more, the bizarre, weightless sensation of simultaneously feeling out of my body and feeling one with another body. Then, something cold, foreign.

[“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”]()

I fell forward into someone’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up. I was surrounded by a team of men in yellow hazmat suits, working to fully cut me down from the wall of flesh. I laid in their arms, feeling the way I imagine a newborn infant must, my body and mind focusing entirely on trying not to seize up from how overwhelmingly cold everything seemed. A few minutes later, once I’d been fully freed from the wall, I was given sedatives that knocked me back out.

I don’t know how long I’d spent like that, but it must’ve been a few days at least, because it was my girlfriend, Emily, who had called the police after I hadn’t responded to a number of her calls. In the end, though, I was kept in some sort of containing facility for a day, where I was asked a great deal of dubious sounding questions that I couldn’t begin to answer for the most part. And they never ended up finding Andrew.

In the end, though, Emily took me back home, whatever classified part of the government that covers up shit like this did just that, and life mostly moved on. I tried my best to forget about that brief, hellish stint of my life. I certainly didn’t gain any sort of enlightenment or newfound appreciation for life by my experience. I was changed by it, I guess. Who wouldn’t be? But, as I said, life moved on. Emily was invaluable in ensuring that, comforting me about it when I needed her to but never acting like it defined me now.

Life moved on.

Four years later, I asked Emily to marry me. Five years later, she was my incredible wife. Eight years, and she gave birth to the joy of our lives, our daughter Lily. I loved my wife, of course I did, but there’s absolutely no feeling of adoration on this earth that compares to holding your own child in your arms.

And yes, of course I still felt scarred by my experience all those years ago. One night, as we were in bed getting ready to sleep, I told her about it once more. How even though things are fine now, things are *perfect* now, I still had nightmares about the wall of flesh sometimes. I still get sent into near panic attack at the sight of an open wound.

She held me in close.

“I know you do love, I know you do,” she murmured, her voice drowsy but full of care. “But you’ve got me, don’t you? You’ve got us.”

I closed my eyes and felt myself beginning to drift off as she held me closer still. I breathed in the beautiful smell of her rose-scented shampoo. “It’s okay, because I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you,” she whispered.

*“I’ve got you.”*

“I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you!”

“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”

I fell forward into the man’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up and all around, stared at the yellow-suited men, still screaming and babbling incoherently. I laid in their arms, still smelling the rose-scented shampoo, though there was now something horribly wrong with it, like how after you realise the trick of an optical illusion you can never see it as you originally did.

Pheromones.

\*\*\*

It turns out, the wall had been digesting me for quite some time indeed. I saw my reflection. I look emaciated, barely alive.

It showed me wonderful things. Now, I sit alone in my cold, dark apartment, looking outside at grey skies. I think of my wife’s smile. I think of my child’s laughter. I want to go back.",1,1742174481.0,GrimReaderRealm,0,1.0,False
1jd15tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1jd15tf/birthing_cabins_inconsistency_s2e9/,Birthing Cabins Inconsistency - S2E9,"I’m trying to forgive a lot of this show’s bad writing, and can usually (to a certain extent) forgive shows for trying to retcon certain storylines provided it’s done well. However I can’t forgive it when it’s just done so lazily that it treats the audience like idiots.

I just remembered how stupid Devon’s plan is in the latest episode. She says she wants to take Mark to the birthing cabin because she met a woman there who was severed and she believes the doors in the birthing cabin lodges can make oMark turn into iMark. Seems logical right? 

Well it shouldn’t, not from her perspective. In S1E5, Mark literally goes INSIDE the lodge that Devon and Ricken are in at the birthing cabins and he doesn’t turn into iMark. Why would she think it would work like that? She’s literally seen Mark go into one of those cabins and nothing happened. Why would it happen now? 

So is the retcon the writers are trying to use now that ‘only certain cabins have the door that can transition an outie to an innie?’ Well that might make sense right? No, it doesn’t. Because in S1E5, Devon and Ricken are talking about how those cabins are just more expensive (“fat cats making fat kittens”) which means that if they had the money, they could’ve easily been in those lodges. There’s also no security around those lodges in S1E5 which means Devon can just walk inside and grab a coffee with that severed woman, which she does. So what would have stopped Mark from doing that?

I can’t deal with show’s that try to treat their audience like idiots with poor attention spans. The writers clearly inserted the point where security stops Devon and Cobel to ask questions before entering the birthing cabins to show that the place is well secured. But if that’s so, why did they just let Mark go in there during S1E5 to visit Devon and Ricken? Wouldn’t that maybe cause alarm bells with security who should know that he’s severed? Wouldn’t security maybe keep an eye on him at least to make sure he isn’t randomly going into another lodge for coffee like Devon was able to. He’s even allowed to stay the night at the lodge, which he did.

- Btw, I can already anticipate everyone who disagrees with this being a plot hole/inconsistency saying “well we didn’t hear the phone call that Devon had with Cobel so maybe Cobel explained how it actually worked to Devon”. It’s funny how a lot of the logical explanations in this show seem to always happen off screen and in our heads. ",0,1742174473.0,severence,29,0.18,False

We broke up because of a few things. We'd both just gotten out of LTR's when we met and hit it off. She understood I was leaving the country in a year. We had a really great connection for about 5-6 months and she started to get distant. We'd obviously had normal relationship problems and have our flaws. But at the end of the day, by month 7-8, she wanted to end the connection. Her reasoning was our differences, and that the things she wanted to do with her life after her last relationship were being put on hold for someone who was ultimately leaving the country.

She reached out after we split up expressing care and that she didn't want to lose me from her life completely, and that if I wanted to talk about anything she'd be there. I was pretty heartbroken and we were both very sad it had to end. One thing led to another and we ended up still sleeping together and pretty much ended up being a couple still. For about a 1.5 months.

Think her friends encouraged her to properly end things, which she did, and I was obviously upset but understood. I'd kind of let hope get in the way of reality as we still wanted to spend all our time together.

So fast forward to 3.5 months since then, we've gone no contact since then, and she's been very distant and quite cold when I've seen her. Which I understand the need to protect herself and not fall back into anything.

So I leave in about 10 weeks to move overseas, it's been very hard accepting the end, but it was neccessary. I haven't begged or reached out, even though she said maybe we could get coffee in the new year. I think also people told her ""why?"", so she hasn't reached out for that.

So after all that, I've written a letter, and I also wrote her a song that I was supposed to give her on her birthday, but we didn't make it to that. Pretty much the letter just says ""I loved our connection, I understand why we had to end things, I remember all of these lovely things we got to do, I'll think of you often when I get there, and I envy the man who'll one day get to call you his. And I hope we get to see each other again one day and see you happy and proud of the life you've made"". I put the song on a USB in the letter and just mentioned that I hope it's okay I sent it, even though after 6 months you've well and truly moved on.

What do you think? I really do want to send it. I want to leave the country and the connection we had with love and respect and to honour what we had, not to beg to rekindle or anything. Planning on putting it in the mailbox on the way to the airport so she get's it after I'm gone. I have no idea if I'll see her before then, but I'm sure it'd be awkward if we did see each other.

Over the course of the whole day yesterday I took five hundred milligrams of caffeine. I would definitely say it was worth it yesterday. I was the most relaxed I have been in a while. It probably would have been impossible for me to deal with the many people I had to interact with if I did not have that much caffeine.  
  
Today, I only had one cup of coffee. Yesterday as my caffeine wore off I got a big boost of energy followed by drowsiness. As for today, I only felt drowsy. It was the perfect day to feel drowsy too. There were not a lot of people I had to interact with. I even felt better being drowsy than I normally do.  
  
Typically, I do not really like interacting with people. I feel as though I am separated from the human species a lot of the time. The times I am reminded of my own humanity are the times I am most disappointed. Caffeine really helps me deal with people, but also helps me to stay focused. Most times I am either way too over stimulated or under stimulated.

I am am analyst looking to switch coaches, and would love input/advice. 

here is my situation: i don’t feel like my coach and i have a strong connection at all. we’ve only met 3 times since i have started at the firm (it's been 7-8 months) and i feel that every meeting we have is just a 20 minute catchup on how i am doing on my project. (one time they rescheduled our meeting 4 times, hence why we only met 3 times thus far) our meetings don’t feel meaningful and i don’t seem to be getting great advice from them. maybe i could be a better coachee, but i think i am looking for a coach that is more similar to me in terms of skills/interests and offers more mentorship. 

i don’t have a strong network at the firm quite yet, so i plan on just messaging people and setting up coffee chats. ***my question is***: *what is the protocol to asking someone to be your coach?* do i just ask them at the end of the coffee chat if they want to be my coach? or is one coffee chat too short to ask? should i ask them after a few coffee chats? anyone who is a manager/above please let me know how i can best market myself to potential new coaches! i’m a remote analyst so virtual coffee chats are the way to go for me.

1jd0tis,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jd0tis/friend_i_made_at_the_psych_ward_lied_to_me/,Friend I made at the psych ward lied to me,"This is just crazy to me but Hello, I’ve never written one of these before, but this is too weird not to share, so bear with me... I am a 20-year-old female, and I’ve been struggling with mental health issues for a while, but they’ve never been severe enough for me to go into a ward. Until a few weeks ago, I made a mistake and ended up involuntarily in the psych ward for 48 hours.

During my time there, I didn’t talk to too many people, as this was very different for me, and I had never even been in a place like that before. I was also super anxious because the space wasn’t familiar. Halfway through my first day there, a girl introduced herself to me and then proceeded to introduce me to some others. One of the other individuals there kind of kept his head down and didn’t say much.

Anyway, as the day went on, the quiet individual—who I’ll call Jordan—started talking to me, and we quickly became mutuals. I’m a very empathetic person who has the urge to always help people and talk to them when needed. At this point, I was ready to get out, and my concern wasn’t as big anymore, so I was trying to be there for this individual. We hung out for most of my remaining time there, and it all seemed okay—nothing harmful. He walked around wearing one of those ""I heart my gf"" sweatshirts, so I knew he had a girlfriend. I, myself, have a boyfriend whom I’ve been with long-term.

I never saw this as anything but a quick friendship made within the walls. As I was leaving, he asked if he could have my number. I didn’t see it as anything other than innocent, so I gave him my number. Once I got out, I told my boyfriend how I made a friend who had similar issues as myself and mentioned how I gave him my number in case he ever needed someone to talk to.

After a few days, I got my first message, which read:

“Hey [my name], it’s Jordan. We met briefly at the mental health facility yesterday. Very glad I actually asked you for your number. It was quite warm, as I don’t know if you had noticed. Also, my apologies for stepping in when [other patient] randomly tried to say hi to you and your mother. I had walked by and told him to leave you alone. Didn’t want any altercations or him making you feel uncomfortable. I just wanted to make sure he was out of your business. I didn’t want him overstepping a boundary, especially with his history with the young person at the coffee shop. That’s why I sat with you in the morning at the table, watching over you. Also, sorry I didn’t help you out when the tower collapsed. I knew I should’ve, as I sensed it was about to happen. I wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to you, as [other patient] was a bad person in there and had done some questionable things. I was hoping you made it out of there as soon as possible. I wanted to make sure you were safe and got home alright. Just wanted to let you know I’m a level 3 now and very grateful for you, as you were very welcoming and kind. Also, sorry I never played Jenga with you. I was going to. I was actually going to call you and check to see if everything was alright, make sure you made it back all in one piece. I just thought it would’ve been a little rude, as I didn’t know your schedule. I was wondering if you wanted to talk over the phone later or on the lines of any of that. Now you have my number as well, so just let me know, or you can call. Whatever you may want to do. I have my phone for another 30 minutes.”

I saw this as harmless and thought it would end there. I never called because I thought that would be disrespectful to my relationship as well as his. After a day or so, he continued to text me paragraph after paragraph about what was going on in his life, struggle-wise. I didn’t see a problem, as I knew he was going through a hard time, and I said I would be open ears if he ever needed anything. After a few messages, he told me his now ex-girlfriend broke up with him over the ward phone, and he was really upset, among other things. I talked to him and tried to help. Keep in mind, my boyfriend knew I had been talking to this individual for help purposes, and he always knew what I was sending.

This went on for about two weeks. He would text me every day, and it was getting to the point where it was too much. I have issues with being direct, so I felt like I couldn’t just drop him, as I felt it was unethical to tell someone you’d be there for them if they needed to talk. I would still try my best to help, but it became too much, where he was texting so much about other things not related to personal issues that it felt very weird. At this point, I thought, “Okay, maybe he’s looking for a friend,” and that’s fine. But then he would throw subtle compliments toward me or overly nice comments, which me and my boyfriend found strange. I wouldn’t acknowledge it ever, but my responses started to get shorter and shorter, and I would only respond a few times a day.

But as this was all happening, if I didn’t respond within a few minutes to his paragraphs, he would send more messages adding on, and it was just crazy. But me being me, totally blindsided, thought once again, maybe he just needs a friend, and that’s okay. Keep in mind, he would ask me to call almost every day, which I only phoned him once because I felt bad, but I found it very odd. He told me his girlfriend broke up with him and that she was abusive, and nobody ever visited him at the ward or called him, etc. Of course, me being how I am, I felt bad and wanted to help because I felt obligated.

Eventually, he got discharged, and I noticed he kind of cut down on texting me, and my boyfriend and I both were kind of relieved. My boyfriend never had a problem with this, as he knew what was going on and supported me supporting him and was giving him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, as I was saying, it seemed he had cut down and stopped saving everything he’d send, because every message he would save in chat. A few days ago, I noticed he screenshotted my profile on Snapchat and then unadded me, so I was like, “Hmm, weird.” Then I saw he added me back, so I said, “I’m confused,” and he just played it off as if he didn’t know what was happening, then wasn’t answering.

Anyways, the day went on, and I noticed his ex-girlfriend requested to follow me on Instagram, as well as my boyfriend. She also got someone we all knew mutually to text my boyfriend to answer his ex. My stomach dropped because I was like, “Okay… this is weird.” So my boyfriend looked, and she basically was saying how she’s dating Jordan and saw all these messages and is wondering what’s going on and if he knew I was confiding in him.

Long story short, we explained our side of the story, and she was super understanding!! Basically, they NEVER broke up. He lied about that when she literally lives in his house with his parents. He never mentioned her again to me, just told me they were done and that he was having a hard time, and then lied to her, making me look bad!

Anyway, I sent her an 8-minute-long screen recording of every single message we had since he refused to show her, as well as I told her what he said about her. We were all absolutely shocked. It’s like he manipulated friendship. He knew I had a boyfriend and then made me think he and his girlfriend broke up. If I knew they were still together during this, I would have never continued talking to him, because that’s disrespectful, and that’s a girlfriend’s job to help someone, not a stranger. I’m just still baffled. He had sent me so many Instagram messages of things that I just never opened, and it was so much, I was lowkey freaked out.

I told her everything, gave her every screenshot, and she isn’t mad at me at all. She understands completely and has been so thankful for my boyfriend and me’s help in this, but I still feel terrible because I had no idea. I was just trying to be a friend.

Two months ago I posted on here talking about what I want to change to start living a life worth living.

For context I am studying since 2019 one of the hardest subjects in my country. Due to Covid-19 my university got shut down and stayed closed until winter 2022. As you can imagine studying all alone in your flat sucks. No normal university life, no party etc. It kinda threw me in some depressive state if I am being honest. I stayed in this state till 2025.

Furthermore I have some health problems that made the past years not that great. Because of that I had to give up my main sport and became kind of a couch potatoe.

Now to the update:

\- I started running the past two months. I ran years ago farely regular but I stopped. I dont know why. Anyways, six weeks ago I started running 1,5km and that was it. I felt like I needed an oxygen tent after that haha. But I didnt stop there. Now I am running 4 times a week and today I ran 15km without a break for the first time and it felt great! My goal was to try a halfmarathon in October but i think that I will try one in June already. I bought myself a rowing machine that I am using two times a week on my running-off-days with some strenght training as well.

\- I am meeting my friends two times a week now. I have to force myself to it sometimes but I already feel the improvement. Its like I really want to socialize more.

\- I dont know how but it seems like I passed my state exam on my first try! I dont know how I did it, but I got As in some of my final exams haha.

\- I stopped porn completly without any problems. I kinda felt like that I watched it because of the sake of it and now because I really wanted to. It was more a habit.

\- For a lot of you the next one will be just a small win but for me its huge: I started drinking coffee at the age of 15 (now I am 25). 1 1/2 months ago I realized that I drink up to 8 cups of coffee a day and nearly no water. I quit coffee cold turkey. Havent had a drop of coffee or any soda (because of the caffein) in the last 6 weeks. Just water and tee. The frist two weeks was not so great because of the headaches but now I am great!

\- I got a new job. Its a job that will be super interesting and completely in my line of interest. It combines my academic interests with some of my personal interest. The job starts in April and the pay is 35% better then my last job.

\- My physicians told me that my health problem wouldnt change for the better. Its nothing life-threatening but something with my hand. I injured my hand at the age of 9 and it wasnt threated properly. They told me that its more then likely that my hand will be completly paralized in the next 10 years. But thats okay. Finally some certainty that I can work around I guess. I think this news affects my family worse than myself. I have been living with problems, pain and worsening movement restrictions for over 15 years. I somehow expected something like this as it is getting worse and worse. Maybe one day I'll get a hand like Anakin Skywalker :D

What I realized during the past 6 to 8 weeks is that I have to quit or do everything that bothers me or that I want to change in a cold-turkey kind of style. Either I'm 100% in or I'm out. So far, this is an approach that works great for me.

1jd0rey,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1jd0rey/friend_i_met_in_psych_ward_tuned_out_to_be_a/,Friend I met in psych ward tuned out to be a manipulative liar,"Hello, I’ve never written one of these before, but this is too weird not to share, so bear with me... I am a 20-year-old female, and I’ve been struggling with mental health issues for a while, but they’ve never been severe enough for me to go into a ward. Until a few weeks ago, I made a mistake and ended up involuntarily in the psych ward for 48 hours.

During my time there, I didn’t talk to too many people, as this was very different for me, and I had never even been in a place like that before. I was also super anxious because the space wasn’t familiar. Halfway through my first day there, a girl introduced herself to me and then proceeded to introduce me to some others. One of the other individuals there kind of kept his head down and didn’t say much.

Anyway, as the day went on, the quiet individual—who I’ll call Jordan—started talking to me, and we quickly became mutuals. I’m a very empathetic person who has the urge to always help people and talk to them when needed. At this point, I was ready to get out, and my concern wasn’t as big anymore, so I was trying to be there for this individual. We hung out for most of my remaining time there, and it all seemed okay—nothing harmful. He walked around wearing one of those ""I heart my gf"" sweatshirts, so I knew he had a girlfriend. I, myself, have a boyfriend whom I’ve been with long-term.

I never saw this as anything but a quick friendship made within the walls. As I was leaving, he asked if he could have my number. I didn’t see it as anything other than innocent, so I gave him my number. Once I got out, I told my boyfriend how I made a friend who had similar issues as myself and mentioned how I gave him my number in case he ever needed someone to talk to.

After a few days, I got my first message, which read:

“Hey [my name], it’s Jordan. We met briefly at the mental health facility yesterday. Very glad I actually asked you for your number. It was quite warm, as I don’t know if you had noticed. Also, my apologies for stepping in when [other patient] randomly tried to say hi to you and your mother. I had walked by and told him to leave you alone. Didn’t want any altercations or him making you feel uncomfortable. I just wanted to make sure he was out of your business. I didn’t want him overstepping a boundary, especially with his history with the young person at the coffee shop. That’s why I sat with you in the morning at the table, watching over you. Also, sorry I didn’t help you out when the tower collapsed. I knew I should’ve, as I sensed it was about to happen. I wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to you, as [other patient] was a bad person in there and had done some questionable things. I was hoping you made it out of there as soon as possible. I wanted to make sure you were safe and got home alright. Just wanted to let you know I’m a level 3 now and very grateful for you, as you were very welcoming and kind. Also, sorry I never played Jenga with you. I was going to. I was actually going to call you and check to see if everything was alright, make sure you made it back all in one piece. I just thought it would’ve been a little rude, as I didn’t know your schedule. I was wondering if you wanted to talk over the phone later or on the lines of any of that. Now you have my number as well, so just let me know, or you can call. Whatever you may want to do. I have my phone for another 30 minutes.”

I saw this as harmless and thought it would end there. I never called because I thought that would be disrespectful to my relationship as well as his. After a day or so, he continued to text me paragraph after paragraph about what was going on in his life, struggle-wise. I didn’t see a problem, as I knew he was going through a hard time, and I said I would be open ears if he ever needed anything. After a few messages, he told me his now ex-girlfriend broke up with him over the ward phone, and he was really upset, among other things. I talked to him and tried to help. Keep in mind, my boyfriend knew I had been talking to this individual for help purposes, and he always knew what I was sending.

This went on for about two weeks. He would text me every day, and it was getting to the point where it was too much. I have issues with being direct, so I felt like I couldn’t just drop him, as I felt it was unethical to tell someone you’d be there for them if they needed to talk. I would still try my best to help, but it became too much, where he was texting so much about other things not related to personal issues that it felt very weird. At this point, I thought, “Okay, maybe he’s looking for a friend,” and that’s fine. But then he would throw subtle compliments toward me or overly nice comments, which me and my boyfriend found strange. I wouldn’t acknowledge it ever, but my responses started to get shorter and shorter, and I would only respond a few times a day.

But as this was all happening, if I didn’t respond within a few minutes to his paragraphs, he would send more messages adding on, and it was just crazy. But me being me, totally blindsided, thought once again, maybe he just needs a friend, and that’s okay. Keep in mind, he would ask me to call almost every day, which I only phoned him once because I felt bad, but I found it very odd. He told me his girlfriend broke up with him and that she was abusive, and nobody ever visited him at the ward or called him, etc. Of course, me being how I am, I felt bad and wanted to help because I felt obligated.

Eventually, he got discharged, and I noticed he kind of cut down on texting me, and my boyfriend and I both were kind of relieved. My boyfriend never had a problem with this, as he knew what was going on and supported me supporting him and was giving him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, as I was saying, it seemed he had cut down and stopped saving everything he’d send, because every message he would save in chat. A few days ago, I noticed he screenshotted my profile on Snapchat and then unadded me, so I was like, “Hmm, weird.” Then I saw he added me back, so I said, “I’m confused,” and he just played it off as if he didn’t know what was happening, then wasn’t answering.

Anyways, the day went on, and I noticed his ex-girlfriend requested to follow me on Instagram, as well as my boyfriend. She also got someone we all knew mutually to text my boyfriend to answer his ex. My stomach dropped because I was like, “Okay… this is weird.” So my boyfriend looked, and she basically was saying how she’s dating Jordan and saw all these messages and is wondering what’s going on and if he knew I was confiding in him.

Long story short, we explained our side of the story, and she was super understanding!! Basically, they NEVER broke up. He lied about that when she literally lives in his house with his parents. He never mentioned her again to me, just told me they were done and that he was having a hard time, and then lied to her, making me look bad!

Anyway, I sent her an 8-minute-long screen recording of every single message we had since he refused to show her, as well as I told her what he said about her. We were all absolutely shocked. It’s like he manipulated friendship. He knew I had a boyfriend and then made me think he and his girlfriend broke up. If I knew they were still together during this, I would have never continued talking to him, because that’s disrespectful, and that’s a girlfriend’s job to help someone, not a stranger. I’m just still baffled. He had sent me so many Instagram messages of things that I just never opened, and it was so much, I was lowkey freaked out.

I told her everything, gave her every screenshot, and she isn’t mad at me at all. She understands completely and has been so thankful for my boyfriend and me’s help in this, but I still feel terrible because I had no idea. I was just trying to be a friend. AITAH?

**Reasons the Ending is fake:**

Music clues didn’t make sense and cannot be reverse engineered.

Anghkooey meaning remember didn’t make sense and cannot be reverse engineered.

Molotov cocktails and monster capture setups never paid off.

Julie and Ethan are going to be mourning all over again - which we’ve already seen.

Cost very little to do, actors admitted to improvising segments.

Actors openly mocked the ending in an instagram live.

Many 1 on 1 conversations in the woods.

Reincarnation is already very difficult to pull off with different actors and accents, but even more so with actors with unique acting styles like David and Catalina.

Reincarnation and time-travel combined is a mess. 

Juli’s form of time-travel is a very strange astral projection that makes little sense to me.

**The Prank and the Fake Ending**

I believe the last 3 episodes of ""FROM"" S3 are not the real conclusion but part of an elaborate prank and publicity stunt. The ending we saw was fake, written and directed by the actors with support from the showrunners and MGM+. We’ll get three hour special, perhaps including a double bill and extended episode, and we’ll get to binge it all at once.

**Clues Point to April Fools’ Day**

Evidence suggests the real ending will drop on April Fools’ Day. In Donna’s room, there’s a calendar with a question mark on the space after March 31st, which is April 1st. This clue was prominently shown in the finale, inside the room where Elgin was tortured. The calendar strongly hints that the prank connects to April Fools’ Day, signalling when the true ending will be revealed. The actors have also dropped the word “fool” in some interviews.

https://preview.redd.it/j085cktee5pe1.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=97971722d7fc3c174e7471072bcf1f9105a888b2

I think they might quietly swap out the episodes, change the titles, and watch the world explode.

**Suspicion from Actor Interviews**

My suspicion about the fake ending comes partly from actor interviews. I noticed duper’s delight in their expressions—a sign they enjoyed fooling us. Before Season 3’s release, they dropped innumerable clues like mentions of explosions and kept hinting these even after the finale. Yet, no explosions appeared on screen, despite being set up by Kenny’s Molotov cocktails. I can’t express enough just how many clues the show-runners have left, in both the dialogue of the show and in the interviews themselves that have not materialised. Almost every interview is entirely scripted, and where not, the actors improvise.

Predictions for the Real Ending:

NB: the chronology of events and individuals performing each action will likely be very different.

Suspicion and Lists: Tilly’s murder gets accusations thrown around, and lists made. Sarah is hunted down by angry people, put on trial and judged guilty, then put in the box. She survives the night.

Jasper: the ventriloquist doll will speak in a creepy voice and do some Chucky-like things around town. Ethan will speak with the Boy in White.

Bridge Discovery: There will be a bottomless abyss with a broken bridge and a cliff, with something interesting on the other side.

Construction and Invention: Jim and Jade build a revved up motorbike together, which Ellis or Harold jump the chasm at 68mph to make a radio call up a mountain (or in the lighthouse). A Canadian answers, or they hear the Titanic distress signal.

Preparing a Bomb: Jade will build a nuclear steam-pressure bomb to destroy Fromland as revenge, made from the reactor of the fallen (and very heavy) Kosmos 954 satellite with a one minute timer by removing its fuel rods and exploding its casing near water. 

Salvaging a Life Raft: A 1990 Faucett Perú Boeing 727 plane will be found and its inflatable life rafts and life vests collected.

Kidnap: Fatima is captured and kept in the caves near a frozen lake. Elgin was indeed trying to help, trying to give her somewhere safe to give birth. 

Catching a Monster: Boyd will capture a monster using water and the Mabuse defibrillation paddles. He will strap it to the chair and torture it in the church’s basement to learn of her location by turning a screw.

Solar Storm and/or Eclipse: The sun will make everything extremely bright and hot. People will need to blindfold themselves and walk in a chain, holding each other, to deal with the harsh conditions. This may be followed by an eclipse. Both of these may occur in 1978 also. Either way, there is a massacre where monsters run freely, talismans fail, and nobody can see anything. 

Colony House Under Siege: Donna shuts down Colony House and defends it with her axe and shotgun until it is overwhelmed and the house is set on fire. We may see the true form of the monsters without their glamour.

The Battle: Several Fromily, including Ellis, Boyd and Kenny, will gear up with baseball equipment and go full Rambo-mode, throwing Molotov cocktails in the caves. They may find mines, and pick-axes, and burn a lot of spider eggs. 

Elgin and Fatima: Fatima will give birth in the dark via cesarean section. Her baby might be a shape-shifting changeling—(tinfoil: there could be twins, or just Thomas alone instead). This changeling will go back in time and swap itself with Thomas. 

Tinfoil: The bogeyman may then raise Thomas in another timeline.

Remembering: Tabitha will remember she is Eloise. Jade will remember he is Thomas.

Possession and Kidnapping: Several characters will be possessed by invisible spirits that have been haunting the town, watching and interacting, knocking, whispering, and indeed one of whom threw the rope. These people turn psychopathic and after doing drugs, feasting and behaving as if they’ve only a day left to live, they capture seven others, bringing them to Khatri’s stone circle. It may be that cicadas burrow into their heads through their ears and other orifices.

Ritual: Possessed people will play music with various instruments, like a violin, a guitar, a tambourine. There may be singing. The music will mimic the song from the fake ending but with richer tones. Cicadas dig through the back of the skulls of Juli, Marielle and Randall to control them. They do unique, almost interpretive dancing too.

Drugs like alcohol, morphine, cannabis, tobacco, coffee, mushrooms, and potion making of some kind will be involved. Each character will wear a different colour, and their clothing will unravel and fray as the ritual unfolds, forming a rainbow blanket/bridge. Various jewels and objects may also be involved. So too may substances like salt, pepper, honey, oats etc. So too will various fruits and berries like oranges, limes.

The possessed intend to harvest organs from their sacrifices, squeeze the organs for bodily fluids, and consume them. Animals will burst out of the possessed’s bodies and evolve and grow into seven giant monsters from modern European-Canadian folklore, including Big Foot, a Giant Squid, a Sea Serpent, a Giant Spider, the Grim Reaper and Bonne-Homme Sept-Heures..

John Griffin makes much of the fact that FROM is a fable in his latest interview. What is a fable? A story where animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature are anthropomorphised. 

**Russian Roulette Monologue and Trick**: The bogeyman (Bonnehomme Septheures) is embodied as a skinny stinking tall man with long coat, top-hat and bag of sand. He likes to play with his food. Boyd will trick the bogeyman by pretending to be unconscious. He will then challenge the bogeyman to a game of Russian roulette. But he will trick him by secretly filling his belly with alcohol, punching Jade’s belly to projectile vomit out of his mouth, shooting himself while doing the same, which will set himself on fire as he blows the three of them up. Jade will be part of this plan and contribute to the vomiting.

**Battle Royale**: Essentially, the seven spirits have been competing to fill the humans with different emotions, letting some stay alive longer to gather more, then harvesting then via bodily fluids in the organs, ultimately to power their transformations into monsters of modern North East Canadian Mythology (in this timeline), and also cataclysmic powers such as rainstorms, windstorms, freezes, boiling solar storms, tidal waves, floods, quicksand, earthquakes, eclipses and more. The dragon may be able to freeze people to stone like Medusa.

A massive battle royale will occur beside the Brundles, where the Polar Bear and perhaps the Bogeyman and Dragon win, potentially distributing winnings of treasure and magical artefacts. Tilly may fly around on a broom.

**The Canadian Mole:** We’ll learn Clara is secretly Canadian, making her a mole - alternatively she’s like Sarah. Either way, she tampers with Fromily’s plans.

**The Bomb:** Jade may need to disarm the bomb, and forget his iPhone password or run out of battery. Jade is injured. Dying from claw injuries, he recreates the story Julie tells to Ethan with the finger puppets, telling someone (Likely Ethan or if not, Julie or Victor) to tell his parents (Jim and Tabitha) he loves them and to tell his friends (of which he now has many) he said goodbye. The “secret fairies” monsters are closing in, and Jade is beside the bomb, which Ethan sets off by flipping a switch, destroying the fairies and burying them all. 

**Victor’s Escape:** Victor returns to the modern day real world through a red door in the air.

**Time-travel Through the Bottle Tree**: In the chaos, some characters get on the life raft, and others enter the bottle tree to escape. Jade will have solved the puzzle using the 17th Fibonacci number or the Golden Ratio, relating to time and space. But they can only choose a place, not the time. They’ll go through anyway, some holding hands.

**Multiple Timelines**: Several characters will time-travel to up to seven timelines: the 1930s, 1880s, 1860s, 1770s, and 1670s. In the 1860s, we’ll see Crazy Horse and Okie Ito. In the 1880s Fromland, there’ll be a lion, a baby elephant named Columbia, PT Barnum’s Circus Train, and several circus “freaks” and a clown. We may see some mafia guys in 1930s. Some characters may even end up in a future version of Fromland.

**Matthews family in 1978**: Tabitha, Julie, Jim and Ethan will travel to 1978. Ethan will shoot a younger version of his drunken grandfather (or Henry), who was scaring Julie, using Victor’s gun stolen from the post office (it may even be the bearded man in the root cellar). Julie will encounter and talk to the jock monster. They rescue Eloise and Thomas. Jim is captured, or killed. Jade remembers he was Thomas, and Tabitha remembers she was Eloise. They have ancestral memories too.

There will be a predestination paradox, where attempting to prevent an event from happening (Victor’s abandonment) actually ends up causing it. A future version of Juli may try to stop herself from time-traveling - to mimic a Polchinski paradox.

**Sophie’s Choice in 1978**: As they escape the monsters, Tabitha must choose between time-traveling with Julie, Eloise and Thomas, or returning to the real world with Ethan. She chooses Ethan, returning to the real world and living under an assumed name in the states. Julie time-travels to 1993 with Thomas and Eloise and escapes to the real world too.

**Julie, Eloise and Thomas in 1993**: Eloise and Thomas have lost theirs minds and has no memory. Julie will find herself near Tabitha and Stephen King’s house in Maine, and will seek shelter there.

**Eloise in 1993:** Tabitha King and Stephen King call the police with Julie’s permission, who place Eloise as a patient in an institution. Eloise is named Tabitha because that’s the name on the police report. Julie leaves a note with Eloise telling her to be kind to men named Jim—which Eloise’s adopted Colombian parents hide, but acknowledge. 

**Thomas in 1993:** Meanwhile, Julie drops off Thomas with a now much older Tabitha, telling her it’s her responsibility to raise him. With Ethan now old enough, Tabitha takes Thomas to France and raises him there, pretending to be his grandmother and naming him Jade. This makes Tabitha both his mother and “grandmother”, with Ethan and Julie being Jade’s siblings, Victor his uncle, Henry his grandfather. 

**We Have To Go Back in 1993:** Juli asks Ethan to come back to Fromland with her to help her rescue Jim. She may even have a bandaid on her head like Jack from Lost. Ethan refuses. Juli goes back and becomes a hermit, living alone.

**Stephen King’s House in 1993**: At the Kings’ house, Julie receives a red book used as a diary by Philippe de Commines from Stephen King. We may get a flashback from the reading of this diary to John Cabot/Bridget of York and Tudor England.

I imagine it like this:

*Dartford Priory 1498*

*A nurse runs down a corridor with a candle, it's cold and a woman is screaming in pain. She opens the door and she's told to shut it quickly and asked if anyone saw her. Prioress Cressner seems concerned with secrecy than teenage Bridget, screaming in the bed, who is being hushed by the nuns - it's clear she's a nun herself. Bridget gives birth to a girl she names Agnes. Someone calls her a princess. Everyone is sworn to secrecy. Bridget is told she can leave the baby, but she is banished.*

**Real World 2005:** All Eloise had was her mother’s bracelet, and after growing up to be Tabitha, later copies from subconscious memory and gives to Jim. This bracelet returns to Fromland with time-traveling Juli visiting the hospital to watch her birth. She then goes to Tabitha’s funeral in France, and buys Jade a soda on her way back. Ethan, who has come with Julie, is the uncle that Jade will live with in the real world now.

**Natural Disasters**: Jade’s bomb’s timer counts down and then goes off, setting off an earthquake that will fracture the ground, creating a giant hole and crumbling the town. A flood, twister, and rainstorm will follow. The rift will create whirlpool after a tidal wave.

**The Laser Battle:** Fromily will use the lighthouse’s fresnel lens to focus sun or starlight like a laser to burn the monsters.

**The Submarine:** Elgin and Randall take shelter in the remains of a British submarine, P-514, buried under the root cellar, its opening being what the hatch actually leads to - and is used as a bunker during the apocalypse. Later, they are deep underwater, seeing a giant squid, a great white shark, dolphins, porpoises, whales and a giant crab.

**The Ark**: The plane’s life raft will save people like Bhakta and Donna, and a loch-ness monster type sea serpent will chase the boat amid flare shots. A tidal wave will hit, and everything will be sucked into the hole, forming a whirlpool that pulls the boat through the core of Fromland, even where there’s no gravity, until they use a winched anchor hooked onto a tree to reel themselves back to the surface. 

**Journey to the Island**: Survivors in the boat will sail into an ocean following the North Star to an island. The survivors may catch a literal red herring to eat raw.

**The Lost Canadian Theme Park Tropical Island:** Jungles contain a rat-infested Canadian amusement park based on Trinity Loop in Newfoundland, with a Ferris Wheel, mini-golf, a Merry-Go-Round, four kings, teacup rides, and a roller coaster. A uniformed Mountie monster and Canadian sitcom stereotypes will be present. The town is populated by a Canadian community of “others,” played by former ""LOST"" cast members like Terry O’Quinn, Josh Holloway, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Emerson, led by a woman who might be an older version of Julie, who at one time was a Danielle Rousseau-type character.

I imagine it as the survivors getting off the lifeboat, staggering into a hot jungle, stumble out into a clearing with a rundown amusement park and ferris wheel...and then a mountie rides up them, yelling at them to “Get inside. It's not safe in the light.” 

**The World’s Shape**: We’ll zoom out to Fromland to see its shape: a bubble/bottle surrounding a board, with Canadian Fromland on top, and American Fromland in the upside-down. We may see all these figures playing the game, with everyone in miniature in a diorama.

**The Realm of the Dead**: By the end, nobody else is left in the town, which may have crumbled entirely. Many major characters are dead, and this round of the game is lost. The dead’s souls will be stored in trees growing from seeds. People may be shrunk into a snow globe or something like that.

Their ghosts will arrive in a black and white filmed, root-filled hellscape—a mirror-realm of the dead—full of townsfolk ancestors and people in white or grey, including an older woman, and perhaps Michael Emerson. This will involve Cleopatra and Marc Anthony’s tomb or pyramid, with mummies. Ultimately, many of the main cast are “on ice” until they can be resurrected. It’s likely the world of the dead is completely silent, where none can speak, but if not, the ghosts might only be able to say one word: “ANGHKOOEY!”

**Severance Crossover:** Series creator John Griffin could make a surprise appearance on Severance alongside Harold Perrineau, whilst Ben Stiller and Adam Scott make an appearance on FROM. 

**Canadian Fromland Spinoff with American Actors:** MGM+ alternate seasons of release. 

**Time-travel Fromland Spinoff:** Includes new cast from the future and surviving cast stuck in the past. I suspect there will be a converging timeline endgame, capping everything off with a crossover feature-film with limited theatrical release finale.

**Amazon All-Star Reunion Reality TV Candid Camera Escape Room Spinoff**

During the writers’ and actors’ strikes in summer 2023, I theorise that a unique event quietly occurred in Nova Scotia. Actors from major franchises associated with Midnight Radio, Amazon Studios, Paramount, and MGM+ were discreetly invited to the exclusive Fox Harb’r resort for unscripted filming. Participants adhered strictly to strike regulations and signed comprehensive NDAs to ensure complete secrecy.

The event, presented as an all-expenses-paid, relaxed getaway, provided actors with an opportunity to reconnect both formally and informally with former cast-mates as well as colleagues from other studios. 

What was filmed was a groundbreaking reality-TV candid-camera “haunted house” escape-room reunion show filmed on the existing FROM set. Actors would arrive by coach and take part in puzzles, either humorously meeting their demise or successfully escaping, while FROM cast members may have portrayed their actual characters.

**Revised final answer:**

*Fromland is an ancestral curse that once held Ben Franklin, Frank Sinatra, the Bearded Lady, Henry Morgan and Crazy Horse, located beneath Cape Race lighthouse contained in a broken bottle of urine and holy nails wrapped in a witch’s ladder of artefacts, where medieval board and tarot games are played in mirrored Canadian and US Fromlands and a Pyramid land of the dead, between 4 angels, 7 cursed humans and the people of Gomorah, from over a dozen mythologies and religions (Christian, Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, Arthurian/Welsh, Irish, Dante’s Hell, Heaven & Purgatory, Templar/Cathar, Norse, Iranian/Indian/Arabic, Indigenous Canadian, Modern Canadian) that began their lives as Samael, Shamsiel, Sariel and Azazel, Canaan, Cain, Lilith, Leah, Sarai, Rebekah and Rachel, with animal familiars harvesting emotions through human fluids and organs to battle in the form of Bigfoot and other evolving Canadian mythological beings, alongside time-travelling Juli and the tree-ghost of centuries-old Bridget of York, a former pregnant nun, English princess and cunning folk woman who took part in pagan international celebrations and endured a witch's trial that included a Penalty of the Peach by a mad homophobic priest who faked his death, all while marooned in Newfoundland with Dracula following an escape with her brother and pretender to the throne after he was broken out of the Tower of London by John Cabot, (whose descendants, Tabitha and Jade are unknowingly time-traveling amnesiac Eloise and Thomas) alongside the secretive order of the brotherhood of death at the behest of Philip the Handsome, spurring warring Rosicrucian orders founded by Da Vinci safeguarding and seeking objects across time (including Bridget’s (Esmerelda’s) Devil’s Forehead Urim Emerald Tablet Cathar Holy Grail Philosopher’s Graalstone once sought by a gay Jewish Nazi SS officer who loved Himmler, that was given to Elizabeth 1 by an occult magician) and passed between writers, artists, inventors, musicians, including Stephen King, Monty Python and David Bowie like a historical sisterhood of the travelling pants, inspiring works through dreams including Lost, Cthulhu, Alice in Wonderland and the Hunchback of Notre Dame – and it was all dreamed up by John Griffin when he was trapped in Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11.*",1,1742172970.0,FromCircleJerk,0,0.67,False
1jd0o5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jd0o5p/would_i_be_the_asshole_for_inviting_my_exwifes/,Would I Be the Asshole for Inviting My Ex-Wife’s Boyfriend to My Wedding?,"I (33M) am getting married to my amazing fiancée (31F). She’s been my rock through some of the hardest times of my life, particularly my divorce from my ex-wife, Stacy (32F).

A little backstory: Stacy and I were married for five years before I found out she was cheating on me with her coworker, Dan. What made it worse was that I considered Dan a friend, so the betrayal hit even harder. When I decided to leave, Stacy tried to manipulate me into staying—blaming the divorce on me for not being willing to “fight for our marriage” or go to counseling. I didn’t see the point in fixing something so broken, so I walked away.

After that, Stacy made it her personal mission to sabotage any potential relationship I could have. Growing up in a small town meant that word traveled fast, and she used that to her advantage. If I so much as went on a coffee date with someone, Stacy would find out and go out of her way to track them down—telling them we were still together, still married, or just spreading general lies to create drama. It worked. Most of the women I talked to wanted nothing to do with me after she got to them.

But my fiancée was different. Instead of ghosting me or believing Stacy’s nonsense, she actually came to me directly and asked what was going on. We had an open and honest conversation, and she quickly saw through Stacy’s manipulations. That was when I knew she was something special.

Fast forward three years, and we are now engaged. When we started discussing wedding plans, I half-jokingly mentioned inviting Dan—almost as a twisted “thank you” for cheating with my ex and inadvertently helping me get out of a toxic marriage. My fiancée actually loved the idea, seeing it as a final, satisfying bit of karma.

Now, here’s where it gets complicated. Some mutual friends have told me that Stacy and Dan are still together, meaning if I invite him, she’d be his plus-one. That makes it even more of a slap in the face, and while my fiancée and I find the whole thing amusing, some of my family members think it’s petty and mean-spirited. They’ve even said they might not come if we go through with it because they don’t want to be part of a wedding with that kind of drama.

So, would I be the asshole for sending Dan an invite? Is this just a harmless joke or a seriously bad move?
