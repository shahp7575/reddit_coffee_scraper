I’ve been severely depressed for about three years, not coping terribly well but army-crawling through life.

I have a few tasks to complete today, but I am very dysregulated following a difficult weekend with family members.

I drank some coffee and immediately felt overwhelmed. Took my ADHD meds too. I just feel scared of everything. Half the day has passed me by, and I’m under a heavy blanket now, trying to figure out how to find a way out. Maybe being aware of CPTSD has me less dissociated this days, which just drops me straight into anxiety.

I don’t have anyone to talk to, and not sure which crisis/distress phone lines would be appropriate, so I’m here. 

Any advice on how to tackle difficult tasks when triggered? Thank you in advance.",1,1729527026.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’m D, a 27-year-old female, and I have been roleplaying for a million years! I love occ. My writing style is third person, literate.  



Writing samples can be found here: 



[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOvu8S9qTohdUdZPZPBUfT5uoWgx4710eebFQo5RSrA/edit?usp=sharing\~](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOvu8S9qTohdUdZPZPBUfT5uoWgx4710eebFQo5RSrA/edit?usp=sharing~) 



Plots I am interested in playing:

1. Years after the events of \*A Court of Thorns and Roses\*, Nyx is sent to the Spring Court to assess its progress in rebuilding. There, he uncovers a startling secret—Tamlin has a daughter, a quiet and sheltered young woman whom he has hidden away for her protection. To Nyx’s surprise, she is his mate, a bond that throws him into conflict as he grapples with their family histories and the scars of the past. Torn between the tension of their court's fraught relationship and the undeniable pull of the bond, Nyx must decide whether to follow his duty or embrace the mate he never expected.
2. A senior football player at an HBCU is on the verge of the NFL draft, but his future is jeopardized by a class he’s struggling to pass. Enter his tutor, a fellow senior with a sharp mind and a compassionate heart, tasked with helping him stay on track academically. As they spend more time together, their relationship blossoms beyond just tutoring sessions, evolving into a deep, romantic connection. The pressure of the upcoming draft and the uncertainties of the future loom over them, but through their bond, they navigate the challenges, finding comfort and passion in each other. The story combines the excitement of their budding romance with moments of intimacy, all set against the backdrop of their final year in college and the life-changing opportunities that lie ahead.
3. A slice-of-life plot featuring a single father could be a wonderful mix of heartwarming romance and everyday life challenges. The single father, perhaps in his mid-to-late 30s, balances raising his child and managing his career, while my character, who is about 10 years younger, enters his life unexpectedly. She could meet him through work, at the child’s school, or in a casual setting like a coffee shop or park. As they grow closer, she becomes a supportive figure for both him and his child, and their connection slowly evolves from friendship into a romantic relationship. The story can explore the complexities of their age gap, her navigating the new dynamic of dating a father, and him learning to open up again to love after being focused on his child for so long. Their bond would blossom naturally, creating a sweet and tender romance.



I love romance plots with some spice. All of that being said, my story:smut ratio is 60:40. I can share my kink list upon request. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+. 



Happy Roleplaying, friends!

Vanilla Affogato- Vanilla flavor mixed with slight creamy milky notes. Overall flavoring is light. Coffee flavor is stronger than the flavoring (especially because it is a medium roast). Smooth flavor with a good taste but could use more vanilla affogato flavor.

Tiramisu- Dark Chocolate flavoring with slight cream flavor. I am not really getting a sweet cheese flavor like mascarpone. Oddly enough, I get nutty notes that somewhat resemble a light hazelnut. This one has more noticeable flavoring added than the Vanilla Affogato but seems less true to the name. It is not as smooth either. (It is also a medium roast,)

  
Between the two I believe the Vanilla Affogato is better but it could use significantly more flavoring. If you like coffee with very little flavoring the vanilla affogato is for you. If you like nutty coffee you will like the Tiramisu.",1,1729526869.0,aldi,0,1.0,False

we are regularly asked to do a variety of unrelated favors for people that are Whole Foods customers, not necessarily our customers. (Also from wf workers and Amazon returns workers.)
Requests include but are not limited to: Can I have a cup/cup of ice/a straw/3 cups with 3 lids/cup of hot water?
Can you wet this paper towel? Can you wash my fruit? (I just washed an Amazon returns worker's bag of grapes, which is what prompted the post)
Personally, I would never even think to go into a grocery store and expect to get cups of water, my fruit washed, hot water for my single serving of oatmeal. These are things you do after the store at home, but apparently these people's middle name is entitlement. (My theory is they need some sort of extra compensation after having spent what they spent at Whole Foods, but we’re just a smallish local business not owned by Bezos)…. But that’s a mouthful! 

And I'm sweet and I do it but it eats away at me and I want to deny the requests without sounding like the stingy Scrooge grinch lady who won't wash a baby's apple or someone's snack.

[About d.grayi](https://lv1.studio/pages/about-lv1-studio)

[Beautiful and secure packaging](https://imgur.com/a/IJUbLTK)

I purchased (and have since full sized!) **White Rabbit** and **Pandan**,  [which I originally reviewed here] (https://reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1flh884/first_time_trying_dgrayi_perfumes/). I had really enjoyed everything I tried from d.grayi, and they were kind enough to send me the AAPI Heritage Collection as press samples. 

I've had so much fun testing them, and the lovely packaging really adds to the experience — the box looks really nice on my dresser, no worries about sun exposure or leaks, and I can easily pick out a new scent everyday. 

The trading cards are adorable, and it's nice to be able to see the notes without having to go online. I also really like the ceramic tile — it's a great option for sleep scents or using perfumes to scent a room.

Also, they sell individual samples, but if you're interested in buying the full set, I definitely recommend grabbing [the one with the $50 gift card] (https://lv1.studio/products/aapi-month-discovery-set-16-x-1-5-ml-apothecary-vial-1) — it's the same price! Both of my orders were shipped securely and incredibly quickly (the first one went out on the same day!).

&nbsp;

And onto the reviews, in the order I tested them — so if you've read my last thread, skip the first two :)

🐇 **• White Rabbit EDP**

*TOP : Milk Candy, White Pepper, Carrot*

*HEART: Tuberose, Rice Paper, Pandan*

*BASE: Hay, Bunny Fluff, White Musk*



Opens with sweet, creamy lactonics, infused with pale vanilla and wrapped in sheer rice paper. Soft notes of warm, golden hay and sprigs of green alfalfa balance the milky candy. As carrot seed oil and silky tuberose deepen the scent, the rich gold of carrot seed oil blending with heady white florals for something that is as luxurious as it is comforting. 

A touch of fluffy, white, bunny fur is the perfect finish, a snuggly, gently animalic musk that elevates this scent far above the usual interpretation of White Rabbit candy — complex, yet soft and calming. I'm considering a full size, I can't get enough of this cute, cuddly scent!



💚 **• Pandan EDP**

*TOP: Bread, Coconut Milk*

*HEART: Pandan Tincture, Sandalwood*

*BASE:  Pine Resin, Vanilla Waffle*


The smell of warm, toasty bread fills the air, such a homey, comforting scent. Cool, creamy coconut milk follows, a soothing contrast to the freshly baked bread. The rich cream is slowly infused with fragrant vanilla bean, drawing out its natural sweetness. 

The familiar scent of Pandan emerges, pale green and delicately floral, a plush cloud slowly deepened with soft, nutty sandalwood and the sticky amber of pine resin. 

I've tried so many pandan scents, and this is definitely my favorite, exactly like a luxurious pandan dessert, deeply fragrant with great throw and longevity. I've been wearing this daily despite having lots of perfume to test and was about to get a full size when a lovely friend surprised me with an early birthday present — although at this rate, I might need another one soon, I'm obsessed!

☕ **• Cà Phê By Night EDP**

*TOP: Vietnamese Coffee, Carrot, Tomato Leaf*

*HEART: Jasmine, Oakmoss, Hay Absolute*

*BASE:  Sandalwood, Civet, Ambergris*

Opens with a bittersweet blend of dark brewed coffee and roasted chicory root, its nutty warmth deepened by the soft scent of toasty hay. 

Bright, peppery tomato leaf follows, enhanced by pillowy moss and gleaming oak — a green, herbal freshness that is soon smoothed by the silky gold of carrot seed oil. The snuggly carrot seed is sweetened with a heady infusion of night-blooming jasmine, creating an inviting aura of romance and comfort. 

A soft base of creamy sandalwood and rich, golden musk winds through the scent, a golden caramel that is luxurious and seductive with an undercurrent of cozy warmth. 

Dries down to swirls of sweet jasmine and carrot seed oil, scattered with delicate alfalfa, all resting on resinous musks and milky sandalwood with a splash of nutty coffee.

This is an incredibly complex and nuanced fragrance, with no single note stealing the spotlight. It makes me think of snuggling up in bed with a lover, sharing a cup of coffee before drifting off to sleep — beautiful and uniquely alluring, yet approachable enough to be a signature scent. 

Usually I love sharing my favorite fragrances with the community, but when I saw that there were no full sizes left, I was a teeny bit tempted to keep this one secret :p



🌴 **• Pemouwood EDP**

*TOP: White Pepper, Neroli*

*HEART: Vietnamese Pemouwood*

*BASE:  Sandalwood, Cedarwood*

An opening of bright, tropical neroli is followed by zesty white pepper, drawing out the flowers' buttery petals. The rich fragrance of pemouwood slowly emerges, notes of resinous amber and smooth, golden woods. 

A base of fresh cedar deepens the pemouwood, revealing its sweet, green notes and evoking thoughts of dense rainforests at dawn, peaceful and calm as the morning sun surrounds the trees with a gentle glow.

I've never smelled pemouwood before, but this is really lovely. It reminds me a bit of Hinoki of Hiba wood, but there's a rich, piney warmth and a natural sweetness to the pemouwood that I really enjoy. 

I was initially hesitant about trying this scent because neroli can be harsh on my skin, but beneath the citrus is a lush cream that blends perfectly with the balmy woods. Sensual and soothing, another addictive scent from d.grayi!




🐺 **• Black Dog EDP**

*TOP: Durian Tincture, Black Licorice, Vietnamese Spices*

*HEART: Tuberose Absolute, Galangal, Ebanol*

*BASE:  Labdanum, Vietnamese Oud, Civet*
 
 
Wet, this is dark and savory with an oily note that somehow reminds me of gasoline — I'm assuming this is the durian. As it dries, galangal emerges, a bright spice that balances the durian, bringing notes of sweet ginger and smooth lemon, soon joined by smoked anise and a touch of woodsy cinnamon. 

The scent deepens once again, dark oud and smooth, animalic musk. Heady tuberose follows, a tropical, floral cream that brings the sweet citrus back to the forefront, formed by a touch of smooth sandalwood.

This is a really interesting fragrance, I keep smelling it despite not vibing with the more savory and industrial notes. If you like either of those aspects, I highly recommend  giving Black Dog a try, it's undeniably high quality.





🐈 **• Myrrh Cat EDP**

*TOP: Catnip, Carthamus, Bergamot*

*HEART: Myrrh, Frankincense, (Betel)Areca Catechu*

*BASE:  Dragon's Blood, Civetone, Gingseng*

 
Opens with the peppery, herbal notes of catnip, made bright with a squeeze of citrus. The gentle nuttiness of carthamus softens the freshness, making way for the smooth warmth of real myrrh. Woodsy frankincense and spicy Betel deepen the rich resin, swirling with sultry animalic musk, as dragon's blood adds a touch of dark sweetness. 

I'm very fascinated by herbal medicine, so this scent really piqued my interest, especially since I've found that this house makes very balanced herbal scents, not harsh or overly clean. And Myrrh Cat is particularly smooth — a deep, golden musk with a sweet spark, very warm and comforting.



🐑 **• Lychee Sheep's Shadow**

*TOP: Bergamot, Rose, Reishi*

*HEART: Lychee Tinture, Pemouwood , Black Tea*

*BASE:  Wool, Labdanum, Oakmoss*


A cheerful blend of ripe, juicy lychee and pink rose petals is slowly brightened with a hint of bittersweet citrus peel. A splash of clear, black tea brings out the nuance in the botanicals, as the dark, musky caramel of labdanum adds its deep warmth. Fuzzy, white wool slowly emerges, wrapping the scent in a soft, snuggly hug. 

A base of resinous, golden woods and shadowed oakmoss creates a warm, woodland atmosphere, as the rich, pink glow brings out an element of feminine magic. A very evocative fragrance — a deep, thriving forest shining with hopeful mysticism and comforting, feminine vibes.

I'm not usually a fan of rose, so this would have normally been a sample I tested last, but it smelled so lovely in the bottle — and is even more wonderful on skin, a very gentle rose. The lychee is at the forefront here but never becomes overwhelming, and the supporting notes make it delightfully complex. The lanolin becomes more apparent after the first hour, enriching the cuddly sweater with its thick cream. Though the scent of the golden forest fades slightly on the drydown, the aura of natural magic remains.

A sweet, soothing scent with an element of dark fantasy, highly recommended!



🌹 **• Rose Dragon EDP**

*TOP: Perilla, Dragon's Blood, Pink Pepper*

*HEART: Rose, Peach Blossom Accord, Patchouli*

*BASE:  Frankincense, Golden Amber, Peach Resin Tincture*

Opens with soft rose powder, followed by a sheer blend of herbal perilla and fresh citrus. Scattered rose petals smooth the rose powder, creating a silky finish that is further deepened by the ruby red sweetness of dragon's blood — fragrant and rich without being perfumey.

Perfectly ripe peaches emerge and are slowly swirled with balsamic resins and liquid amber, creating a deliciously natural fruit resin. Delicate, white blossoms are plucked from the tree, becoming lush and creamy as amber envelops them. Jammy roses join the peach blossoms — sweet, romantic florals surrounded by the sensual glow of peach amber. 

A beautiful, realistic blend of fruits and florals with a complex, luxurious feel that is both empowering and alluring.

These two months without you,I've still loved you and fought The urges, the impulses, And every reckless thought. Maybe if you were dead, it would be easier—It wouldn’t be *he doesn’t want me*, just *he’s no longer here*. Gone from this world, no need to pretend—No rejection, just an inevitable end.

But you're alive, and that's good, right? Even though I see you're not doing well, Mentally or physically—I can see you swell. I tell myself it’s not my fight to fix, But damn, watching you fall apart, it sticks. You ghost me, but you’re haunting me daily, And still, I hold on to you—faintly, maybe.

Remember how we used to dream together? Late nights talking about forever? Now it feels like you’ve drifted away, And I’m just standing here, with so much to say. I still hope for us, I do, But I’m learning that hope feels like a noose too.

I’ve got a lot to catch you up on, But what’s the point if you're already gone? Still, you're not dead—just distant, like a ghost I can't touch, And I wonder if I ever mattered that much.

I saw your last post; you looked happy, I guess. But who am I kidding, I can see through the mess.Your smile was always good at hiding the pain, And I wonder if I’ll ever see you again.

Maybe this letter is just for me, A way to cope with the uncertainty. I’ll hold out hope for a little while longer,But if you don’t come back, I’ll just have to grow stronger. At least you're not dead—But sometimes, that thought fills me with dread.

I’ll wait for the day we talk again, Even if it’s just to say goodbye as friends. Until then, I’ll keep writing, trying to heal, And hoping someday, I’ll know what’s real.",1,1729526135.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

Imagine a day kicked off with a coffee brewed just the way you like it by a smart system, and a commute made smooth and safe by self-driving cars that talk to each other effortlessly. This vision isn't science fiction—it’s a look ahead to the possibilities of the next decade, where AI stands to boost our productivity, spur creativity, and free us to explore interests that once got lost in the shuffle of daily chores.

In this anticipated era, companies will tap into AI to enhance their operations, merging human creativity with the accuracy of machines. Envision a dynamic workplace where AI takes care of the tedious tasks, enabling teams to stretch their creative muscles. Fields such as healthcare will see transformations, with AI diagnostics offering faster, more precise patient care and tailored treatment plans. The synergy between people and technology could foster an environment ripe with innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable both professionally and personally.

Yet, this wave of technological progress isn't without its hurdles. While we welcome AI automation, we must keep ethical concerns and responsible implementation top of mind. The topic of job loss gives rise to important conversations about retraining and developing new skills, paving the way for a future where technology complements rather than competes. With careful planning, the coming years could herald an age where AI handles the routine, enhancing the human journey and striking a balance that nurtures growth, creativity, and connection in ways we've long envisioned. https://firebringerai.com/2024/10/20/what-the-future-holds-for-ai-automation-in-the-next-decade/",1,1729526088.0,FirebringerAI,0,1.0,False

Things that irk me about WFH:

The pop ins that deregulated NK, then the leaving me with that fussy kiddo who will now need to be settled.

The “do you think she’s eaten enough? Should I make more fruit?” No, this is my literal job, move along and let me do my job. But instead I then have to pick up raspberries off the floor because I already offered her raspberries and she didn’t want them but WFH DB butted in. 

The loud Zoom calls, the sneezing, slamming the door shut, flushing the toilet that shares a wall with a sleeping NK. Pretty much 90% of the noise throughout the day is from DB, despite having a toddler in the house 🤔

And the awkward moments where NK and I were doing something but DB comes and takes her and just stands around with her and I have no idea what I should be doing so I just tidy up and pretend to be busy because I don’t know if this is a long visit or a short visit and I certainly know we won’t be able to go back to what we were doing before we were interrupted.

Parasites? IBS? ","Very long post (tldr at end), kind of venting, kind of just want to be thorough, so sorry in advance! But hi, I had a colonoscopy in May and my doctor found mild inflammation (mostly redness in some parts of my colon, and a few small ulcers around where my small and large intestines meet) and she did a biopsy on each section, but none of them tested positive for crohn's. I also had blood work done the following week, and everything came back normal except I'm low on vitamin D and I'm on the lower side of normal for ferritin (but my iron levels are fine). I'm a 27 year old male if that matters, and I've been sick for a bit over a year now. My doctor put me on budesonide just to see if it helps, but I was getting side effects from that right away so she had me stop, and she also wants me to do another colonoscopy this next month which I'm really not looking forward to. I also had a calprotectin test last Fall/Winter and that was normal, and my CT didn't show any inflammation either (it did find a cyst on my spleen though), the colonoscopy didn't seen any swelling inflammation, just the redness in some parts and a few small ulcers around where my small/large intestines meet.

I'm still wondering if it could be something else, but none of the doctors I've seen really want to test for anything else. I suspected it could be a candida overgrowth because last year my GP put me on a prescription for acid reflux, which, as it turns out, I didn't have (all my symptoms back then turned out to be from a mix of seasonal allergies and pet dander allergies, I just had a scratching feeling in my throat that would radiate into my ear, and I was a bit gassy at night because I'd eat later at night since I was working from home, so I kind of suspected it wasn't acid reflux - I did have that in college for a bit because of stress/too much coffee so it wasn't chronic, but I knew how it felt and knew it wasn't what I was experiencing this time - when I told him about all this he pretty much said ""no it's not, it's acid reflux"" and that was it - I'm still trying to find a new GP lol). I read that acid reflux meds can cause a yeast/candida overgrowth even if you need them, so I'm guessing that since I didn't need them at all it probably increased my chances of a yeast overgrowth, especially since my symptoms started within a week or two of finishing my prescription. I also think I might have a gluten/wheat sensitivity since a lot of breads tend to make me gassy, so I don't know if that's a factor too.

I've also suspected it could be a parasite of sorts, because when I was trying natural remedies for candida (on suggestion of my first GI doctor, who didn't test for candida and instead just said ""yeah it sounds like it could be that!"" and also said there aren't any medicines for it, I just have to wait it out - I later looked it up and there are several medicines that can treat it) I saw these solid, opaque white, string-like pieces, that looked sort of in between twine/rope and plant vines. It wasn't transparent or mucus-y like intestinal lining or fiber tend to look like, so I don't think it's that (I've seen that before in my stool as well, it looked nothing like either), it was just a cluster of solid string/rope looking pieces. I had also read that the acid reflux meds can create the low acidity environment for existing parasites to grow/finally show symptoms in otherwise healthy people, so there's that. I've also had countless times where I'd see small white or sometimes whitish yellow pieces in my stool, all about the size/shape of a grain of rice, always with that flat elongated trapezoid-like shape, always in clusters, and I don't think it's food because I'd test it by not eating anything that even might look like that for at least a week or two before trying one of the detox foods again, like any seeds or nuts, then the same thing happened every time, with every detox approach I've tried. The last thing I noticed is that in almost every stool sample I've done there was also a thick, flat, rubber band type piece connecting between a few pieces of stool (it was kind of a whitish color, very rubbery/elastic and strong, if it was cut it'd have sort of a thick rectangular shape but it was only about .5cm wide, at most) and I'd always see a solid lumpy/dry feeling piece of stool that looked like it was stuck, followed by normal looking pieces, probably from the occasional constipation but still. I also had a stool culture done but it was only bacterial so it wouldn't have shown anything anyway (at least not candida), and the local hospital refuses to do microscopic stool tests for worms so I haven't been tested for parasites either aside from the few that release antigens in stool. I know these aren't too common in the US but I took in a stray cat about two years ago and I read you can easily get a few types of parasites from them (hydatid disease, flea tapeworms, etc.) and from what I've read, all of those require specific but simple tests to diagnose them, and my doctors just won't order them, even if it's just to be on the safe side, or at least to shut me up about it. My cat also had roundworms about a year and a half ago, maybe two years ago, not sure if those can be carried over to humans, and both my cats had fleas last year. At this point I'm half tempted to collect some of the worm looking pieces next time I see them and bring them to the vet and say ""oh I found these in my cat's bed can you test them real quick"" but that'd feel insane. I haven't been able to go over much of this with my new GI doctor because my first appointment was kind of rushed and she just wanted to get me in for a colonoscopy since I've been sick for almost a year, then at the colonoscopy I only saw her for like 5-10 minutes while lucid, but my other doctors have been very dismissive (either saying it's impossible to get either worms or candida, or saying ""oh yeah, it sounds like it could be that!"" then proceeding to do nothing). I also met with her PA a few months ago and she was a bit dismissive too, and kept misunderstanding what I was saying or just ignoring what I'd say. I mentioned how I read that the budesonide can also cause or worsen intestinal yeast/candida infections, and asked if me possibly having a candida overgrowth could be why I had such bad side effects from the budesonide, and she said ""haha no, there's no way it'd cause an infection that fast."" Like, I was asking if it could have worsened my symptoms because I might have already been sick with the candida overgrowth this whole past year but it seemed like she thought I meant that the budesonide caused a candida overgrowth? Also every single doctor I've seen puts ""abdominal pain"" as one of my symptoms and I haven't experienced that once since I got sick, I'll even correct them and say ""if anything it's more of a discomfort or just a bloating feeling, there's no pain"" and they say ""oh, okay!"" then I go for my next appointment and they ask about my abdominal pain again. Every time. I don't know if it's because any amount of discomfort is considered pain medically, but that'd be like saying that wearing a sweater that's too thick/warm is also painful, or literally any physical sensation counts as pain. ""Oh I noticed you're wearing a hat? Yes? And how would you describe your head pain?"" ""You're currently holding a water bottle, can you feel it in your hands? Ok great, how would you describe the pain from that?"" Like what is that. My GI's PA did give me a take home SIBO test, she said it'll probably come back negative, still haven't done it yet but I might just in case?

My main symptoms were a weird bloated feeling near my right hip, occasional constipation, extreme fatigue, and just feeling sick/jittery like my body was poisoning itself (I haven't had any pain in my abdomen, but I have gotten back/shoulder pain on and off, usually on my right side but sometimes on the left, this hasn't happened in months though - the real main symptom has been that toxic feeling though, it feels like I've been poisoned or drugged or something and all my doctors have said was pretty much ""oh so you feel sick?"" then write ""abdominal pain"" on my chart, then I say I haven't had any pain and it's not just feeling sick, again, and they're just like ""huh, ok!""). What's worse is this isn't like any sick feeling I've had before, it's like there are toxins flooding my intestines/entire body. I've also noticed that it's mostly triggered by eating a lot of sugary foods (more so the bloating), and carb heavy and/or starchy foods usually set off that toxic feeling, which is also why I suspected it could be candida or some form of parasite. My appetite hasn't really changed either, if anything I've been eating more since I got sick because I feel like I'm not absorbing enough nutrients. My side effects from the budesonide were fatigue, chest tightness, sometimes my heart rate gets fast, my legs would feel really jittery like they're about to run off of my body, more fatigue, feeling kind of weak (it feels more like a sensory thing though, like everything I touch or move has more of a weight to it now, even something as simple as lifting my water cup or coffee mug - also almost fell asleep in the shower because I had to close my eyes when I was rinsing my hair and it being dark made me feel like I was gonna fall asleep or just pass out). It's also weird to me that every type of natural remedy I've tried between candida and worms gave me the same ""die off"" side effects and all of them showed some improvement in my main symptoms after a while - some of them make sense since things like raw garlic or oregano oil are very harsh/acidic and they can probably cause weird side effects in healthy people, but just using herbal oregano in my food, or garlic, or even just adding coconut oil to my smoothies gave me the same effects - even ginger or pepper did the same thing. I feel crazy like I'm dwelling on all of this too much but it doesn't make sense to me that ALL of those had the same effect on me and wound up improving my symptoms after a few days once the ""detox"" feeling passed, and yet I still can't get tested for worms or candida. This whole thing's just been very frustrating, especially since I finally got the colonoscopy and now they still don't know what's wrong! I just want to not feel like my body's poisoning itself lol (that's another reason I'm a little skeptical, I've been reading up on crohns and IBS, both medical journals and forums where people share their experiences, and haven't seen anyone mention that toxic feeling I've been having, but I do keep seeing them on posts about fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections - I know that still doesn't mean it's not crohns, but I still haven't seen anyone mention that anywhere in regard to crohns). Another symptom I have that I didn't know could be caused by candida is I've had dandruff and a lot of dry skin patches this past year, I thought it was just from my diet changes and because I'm getting older but I never had either when I was younger and I read a few weeks ago that candida can cause both. Not sure if it's actually the cause, obviously, but I just thought I should mention that too.

I'm not even trying to obsess over either of these possibilities, I know both aren't too common, but it's just one of those things where I need to be sure, especially when the budesonide can cause or worsen candida, and I was having side effects right away (just for context, I was supposed to start at 9mg a day, but I started with 3mg a day just to see how I'd react - it was a new medicine for me so I was/still am a bit nervous, and the fact that I was getting side effects from such a low dose is a bit concerning), and even more because my first GI kept ordering the wrong tests then said I don't have any of those things (I saw the info on the test results that each one only tested for specific things - each parasite test was only for giardia, cyptosporidium, and one other, and the stool culture only tested for e. coli, salmonella, and shigella - both my GP, his PA, and my new GI doctor all later confirmed that these were all the wrong tests). I read that parasites and candida can both cause inflammation and even ulcers in the digestive system, so I don't really know what I should do or if I should just drop it, or keep pushing to at least get tested for these. I know that even if the biopsy came back negative it could still be crohn's, but this whole process has been extremely frustrating and I just want to be sure and finally get some answers. It's also a bit frustrating because with the worms my new GI said that if I have any she'd see them in the colonoscopy, but everything I've read said they usually live in the small intestines, same with yeast/candida, so I'm not sure if she's even going to want to do any more tests for either. I might ask for an endoscopy or a capsule endoscopy (not sure how expensive those can be though) but that makes me more squeamish than the thought of another colonoscopy. I realize that me asking about these so much probably gives my doctors the impression that I'm a hypochondriac but both cause almost the exact same symptoms and line up with my symptoms perfectly, so it's still very frustrating that they won't test for either.

Has anyone had any similar experiences? Or know anyone who has, or just knows anyone who's had parasites or candida? The CT tech told me that I would know if I had a worm because she had one once after a trip to Mexico and she could feel something was different (she said I'd be able to feel it moving though?), and I have that same hunch but it also didn't help that she said it took her months to get diagnosed even after being in Mexico because her doctor kept saying ""well those aren't too common here, you're probably fine,"" so that wasn't exactly reassuring either lol. The only thing that really worries me, and I guess why I'm so hung up on these two in particular, is that candida can spread into your blood and becomes very hard to treat, and a lot of worm species can migrate to other organs, including your heart and brain, so uhhh I really don't want that.

Sorry for such a long post, I'm honestly at a total loss with all of this. Also sorry if some parts are a bit jumbled, I originally wrote this right after my first colonoscopy months ago but I was nervous to post it. Really don't know what else to do at this point, I'm planning on doing another detox but actually sticking with it, and this time using something less harsh while also changing up my diet to fit/help the detox. I read some foods can help contain the release of toxins from a detox, like when candida or worms or I'm guessing anything similar dies off it releases all of its toxins so you feel way worse for a bit but then better, but if you change your diet and eat foods that can help absorb the toxins it cuts out most of the side effects? Not sure how true that is, I don't know if I should wait to try it again until after my next colonoscopy though because my doctor's PA thinks that the ulcers could be from trying detox remedies, even though I hadn't done any for about two months before my first colonoscopy. Also a bit weird that my GP got all snarky when I told him I was doing the colonoscopy because he thought it was just IBS and said ""well I really don't know what you think they'll find, it just sounds like IBS to me..."" so that was something. It also feels a bit ironic that my doctors say that the natural remedies I've tried could have caused the ulcers because ""anything's possible"" but won't test for worms or candida because ""those are uncommon, so that's impossible!"" I'm just sick of feeling like this and I really want to get my life together but it's kind of hard when I only have the energy to work a few days a week, and even that feels like a stretch sometimes. Thanks for any help, I just want to get better.

Tldr: I've been sick since last summer with some mystery digestive illness, my current GI thinks it might be Crohn's but most of my symptoms don't line up with it aside from general abdominal discomfort/bloating, changes in stool, and fatigue. My symptoms started with a bloating feeling and constipation and that toxic fatigued feeling, for the first like six months of this I went from being regular/going throughout the day to only going to the bathroom within the first few hours of waking up (it's mostly normal now), and my main symptom this whole time has been this weird toxic feeling like my body's poisoning itself, I've never been this tired, even on good days I feel like I only have half the energy I used to. Nothing I've read about crohns or anyone's experience with it points to that, and all my symptoms line up very closely, if not exactly, with candida overgrowth and intestinal parasites (even the white pieces in my stool). Doctors won't test for either because candida tests aren't always accurate, and I don't live in a tropical climate so worms aren't common, so they just won't test for that (local hospital doesn't even have the right tests even though it's just looking at the segments under a microscope and comparing them to the imaging provided on several medical websites because they have whole catalogs of parasites contractible by humans). My GP also put me on acid reflux medicine shortly before I got sick, then it turned out the scratchy feeling in my throat wasn't acid reflux but was instead due to seasonal allergies and pet dander allergies. I also took in a stray cat about two years ago who had worms, and had fleas at one point (gave her medicine for both), and I'm worried that I could have somehow gotten a worm/parasite from her, especially since I've read that acid reflux meds (especially when you don't have acid reflux, thanks GP) can provide the environment for both candida and worms to grow due to the lowered acidity levels in your digestive system, and since I didn't actually have acid reflux like my GP insisted I did, it lowered the acidity even more. It doesn't help that everywhere I've read has said that most people with worms could have had them for years before showing symptoms, and that they only grow when your health or diet changes enough for them to grow. My GP still thinks it's just IBS even with me having inflammation and ulcers, but my symptoms don't line up with that either, and I've read that most people have abdominal pain (usually pretty bad) with IBS/IBD and I haven't experienced any abdominal pain except if my constipation's bad but even then it's mild pain, and most of the trigger foods for either don't really affect me, whereas most of the foods to avoid while treating worms and yeast (carb-heavy foods, starchy foods, excess sugar, etc.) do. Since both have a lot of the same natural remedies, I've tried a handful and each one gave me the same or similar results and the same side effects that line up with people's ""die off"" symptoms I've read about, and all showed the same improvements after a few days. I didn't want to stick with any because the side effects can be a bit harsh with some (mostly the oregano oil, sometimes with the raw garlic but that wasn't nearly as bad) and I didn't want to risk doing more damage in case I don't have candida or worms, I just wanted to see if I'd react to it, and I did, and all of them showed improvements. Most of them also caused me to have white pieces in my stool, the garlic (even just garlic sauce from shawarma, even just herbal oregano causes milder side effects too) causes solid flat white pieces that look like flattened, elongated pieces of rice, usually with tapered corners, and the oregano oil caused me to pass solid, opaque white stringy/rope like pieces, not like fiber or intestinal mucus where it has that mucus-y transparent look, but it looked like bleached twine or small pieces of rope. I told my doctors about that and they all said it sounds like mucus or fiber, then I asked them what color those would be and they said white but mostly clear like nasal mucus, which has just been so helpful.",1,1729525482.0,IBD,2,1.0,False
1g8ss7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1g8ss7w/im703_north_carolina_race_report/,IM70.3 North Carolina Race Report,"This was the second time doing this race. I rarely like to repeat an event, but the weather, race venue and proximity of this one make it hard to pass up.

This race has some unique aspects, like the split transitions, which takes some additional planning. But having done it once already, the anxiety level was much lower. But as usual, the week before the race everything hurt, especially back and hips, which ramped the concern right back to DEFCON 4.

Swim: 30:34

3:30 wakeup was rude. Forgot to have some coffee with the normal race breakfast, which threw off some GI issues. Walking out the door to walk to T2 was about 49 degrees, but didn't feel terrible. We got on the first shuttle to T1 where our bikes are. We found them and discovered this year was a ""clean transition"" (no items left out around the bikes, everything had to be in the provided bike bag). So we placed bottles and pumped tires, and headed for the second shuttle to swim start. That's when the wind off the water made us realize just how cold out it was! Swim start is organized into swim waves (broken down by how quickly you anticipate finishing the swim).  I wandered to the 40ish zone but chose to get into the earlier wave just to get into the water. The water temp that morning was 69 degrees, wetsuit legal, and felt like a bath compared to the air temp. Once we entered the chute and the beeps went off, race face was on! The swim felt great! The water in the Wrightsville beach channel was clearer than expected, and while you couldn't feel the current while swimming, the buoys came up on you quickly! The first red turn buoy appeared to have drifted over a bit, as a few swimmers were pulling it back when I approached, but I made the turn and kept on. A few more zig zags later and the swim ladder appeared. My first thought was, really, we're done already?? Didn't bump into too many people and kept the sighting line well. Came out of the water in 30 mins!

T1: 11:16

It's a bit of a hike to get down the pier, across the highway and then finally into transition. I bypassed the wetsuit strippers (never used them before, didn't want to start now and risk anything), but did however need to stop at the porta-potty (revenge of no coffee!!) Finally got back to the bike, and removed the swim gear and toweled off. Opted for arm sleeves since it was still chilly out, socks with the bike shoes and the Rudy Wing helmet, got nutrition set and shoved everything else back into the bike bag (cannot leave anything you don't want out or they wont bring it to the final transition area). Grabbed the biked and headed for the mount line.

Bike: 3:02:21

I brought the new-to-me QR PR4 to this race. I've only had it for a few weeks, but done a few long rides and had it fitted properly at 90+, so I felt good about using it for this race course, as it's fairly flat and windy. And it was WINDY. For the first mile, I was worried that I couldn't shift to big ring, as that shifter has always been a little finicky and wasn't responding. And when we arrived in NC, the chain had fallen off, so I have to respool it. But then I finally looked down and saw it was already shifted to big ring, so I called myself an idiot (as is tradition) and cranked away. Despite the wind, riding in aero felt great, and I managed to average about 18 mph throughout the course. I didn't drink as much Skratch as I anticipated since it was still colder out (just 1 bottle) but having the X-Labs hamster bottle on the bars was nice to mix water in. Nutrition was my usual snacks (chocolate crepe, Maurten solid, Skratch bar and the magical Uncrustable at the 2 hr mark). Only two issues arose: my helmet really started to dig into my head and give me a headache, so I popped it off at the second air station and reseated it, and it seemed to behave for the rest of the course. My left knee also started aching on the back half of the bike, but not enough to truly affect the bike (though I was mildly concerned for the run afterwards). According to my Garmin, I made the 56 miles in under 3 hours. But according to Ironman, it was 3:02 (I blame the potty break at the second aid station!).

T2: 6:04

Hopped off at the dismount and ran to my spot on the rack. My run bag was where it was supposed to be, so I broke it open, decided to change into new socks, and shoes (used the HOLA Cielo Sky X1s for this event) and remove the arm sleeves, as the sun was now out and it was nice and warm. I had forgotten my handheld water bottle, so I was glad I had packed a mini-water to swish so I grabbed that, race belt and hat and headed for the exit. Remembering I had also forgotten sunscreen, I stopped at the tent just before the exit to grab a packet and smear it all over myself (mostly successfully, except for the backs of my shoulders). Then onto the last leg!

Run: 2:19:02

Run felt amazing! I checked my watch as I was starting and saw I was in my 5K pace, and knew I needed to slow down, but things felt like they were humming. So I decided to keep it up and just walk through the aid stations. I managed to do that for the duration of the 13.1 miles (even up the hills) which was a huge accomplishment. I mostly drank water at the aid stations, popped a Maurten CAF gel around mile 3, and did grab a Mortal cup there too (still gross, but wanted some electrolytes). I ended up not using my Salt Stick tabs I had in my race belt, and tried cramming as many gels from the aid stations in my jersey pockets (Which ended up flapping quite obnoxiously). The run course is great: aid stations were well stocked and the course has lots of shade once you enter the park area. The outside temps hit around 75, but not so bad that I needed ice or to pour water over my head. I stopped at 2 more porta-potties during the run, and about halfway through, my left knee decided it wanted some attention and started to ache. But I kept up the run and felt great all the way through the finish.

Finish

The finish line experience was great!  Slowed up a little to let a fellow racer cross the line and get her solo photos without my dumb head in the way! But got to hear my name as I crossed and then entered the post-race chaos! Finished in 6:09:15, shattering the previous three 70.3 times of 6:36 each!

We rushed him home, and spent all day Tuesday learning that he had an inoperable tumor, likely hemangiosarcoma, on the right atrioventricular sulcus of his giant, perfect dog heart, which has ruptured, and he was in heart failure. At his vet visit one month ago all of his blood values were normal. Now his liver enzymes were off the charts, evidence of significant liver metastasis. Ultrasound confirmed lesions there and in the spleen. We chose humane euthanasia so he wouldn't die in a panic, struggling to breathe with his heart racing.

He was so hard to bond with in the beginning. He was gorgeous and snuggly, but a total butt pain. He was so anxious. He was sound and light sensitive. He would spook when he saw dappled light twinkling on the wall. He was leash reactive (and 75lbs). I broke my wrist because of him. He barked at the TV. We kept treats on the coffee table so that if any animals or statues of animals or pictures of animals appeared we could distract him. He would shut down in new places and try to hide under tables. He was so difficult that it caused me to say out loud many times, ""no more dogs.""

But he was my snuggle bear. You could fully spoon this guy any time. He was great with other dogs, even and maybe especially smaller dogs, off leash. He was so expressive. He was a great hoop jumper and so proud of it. He was always there to help if you spilled some shredded cheese, or finished off the yogurt and needed the container cleaned out, or your sandwich was one bite too big. He made sure we got our exercise and got outside several times a day.

Hemangiosarcoma is a cruel disease. It is almost always discovered exactly this way. There is no test. It is very aggressive. You learn they are sick, when the tumor ruptures and they are dying. By then it has already spread everywhere. There is no easy way to lose a pet, but in a crisis in the hospital is one of my least favorite.

What I am learning, again, in my grief, is that they are not their bodies, they are their own unique manifestation of consciousness and so are we. When we connect with them we are connecting with a more pure form of consciousness itself. It's so hard to let go of the form, but it's easier if you remember that it was the consciousness that you loved and connected with. Consciousness always feels like connection and love. Animals help us recognize our own consciousness that's why vibing with them feels so good. They give us glimpses of our true selves without our egos.

1g8sqak,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1g8sqak/gfil_died/,GFIL died.,"GFIL died within hours of my own grandfather. I am in mourning, and seeking some kind of solidarity or understanding or empathy. Reassurance I'm not crazy. Husband is trying but I feel massive guilt because I wish this whole shit show hadn't gone down and my husband could focus on the normal grief processing that everybody needs when family members die, even if they were shitty family members.

Both men were in traditional Greatest Generation marriages. Needless to say, they both had complicated relationships with their kids and grandkids.

There's sibling drama within the parents generation, cousin dramas following. My husband has been an amazing support with the end of life stuff with my grandfather. I've been supporting my husband in forgetting the drama and going to the things to support his mom, his sisters, his blacksheep cousins who literally introduced us.

He is LC with his parents and siblings. He cares. He doesn't care for the drama. I am VLC, and as a result of extreme social anxiety not available to family that will not meet in person in an environment that meets everyone's needs.

Blacksheep cousin has been NC with GFIL and his own parents for years now.

Us four adults arrived to the visitation/viewing dealio with the baby in the stroller, and blocked at the lobby, being told I am to wait in the car.

Needless to say, my husband walked away with the stroller, I asked FIL to give SIL the gift I sent with the understanding that her administrative role in the end of life stuff is likely stressful given the chaos.

He refused, I went into the car, blacksheep cousin and his boyfriend went in to say goodbyes and hello/goodbyes to the ones they like, and shortly after met up with us for coffee.

I had also hoped to make sure that younger SIL was okay, being a developmentally delayed adult stuck in the chaos of it all, and maybe have been a safe hug should black sheep's even blacker sheep sister shown up for the first time in three years due to active addiction.

I grew up with that kid. In my experience, no contact, limited contact, conflict in general is not a reason to turn your back on family. My bff is my husband's cousin, so his little sister is a part of that.

I wasn't there really for anyone else; but I am civil and also muted by social anxiety. The drama doesn't matter. I'm not stupid, this isn't a place for making a scene. And I left as not to make a scene

An hour prior to, SIL told husband I wasnt not welcome. Husband went in breifly to gave his sister the gift himself and say that he wasnt going to leave his wife in the car. FIL followed him to his sister.

When hubby said he wasnt leaving his wife in the car, FIL said, and it's a quote ""suit yourself."" Husband turned around and left.

The obituary listed me as a spouse, but I wasn't to be there, and only one of our children were listed. My husband called the funeral home to ask that all three of our names were removed.

We have agreed that I am responsible for my child's safety, so our child will not be in environments I can't be.

He will probably drop from LC to VLC. For developmentally delayed sister's safety.

This all went down yesterday and I need to get ready for my own complicated family funeral, and I'm distracted waiting for the shoe to drop on us having asked to be removed from the obituary.

After that we became good friends and I don't know how or why I started feeling attracted to him. We would have long and deep conversations and relate on so many things. He even would do favours for me like grabbing coffee for me etc. In my brain I know that he is not a good person for me because he is nothing close to what my ideal guy should be like. I have tried to move on and ignore my feelings but my heart says otherwise. I even have been getting marriage proposals which I refused because of my feelings for him. I feel like it's mentally torturing because I know he doesn't feel the same way but I can't seem to get over my feelings because I see him everyday. Also, I literally haven't had feelings for someone in like 7 years (I'm 25) so this is so draining. :(

","So far... Couple of months into the game... I think the game has alot of good aspects to it... It's a really good game tbh... Many things are done right and many are done perfectly... Be it Art, Music, Character Designs, Battles Mechanic, UI, Voice Acting, Gameplay...Too early to discuss the story, (maybe rely on comics a bit more than character dialogue split screens?)

However so much was done right, but what was done wrong? (in my opinion) 
1. The reward system is not the best(AND IM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE POLYs)

I'm pretty sure many players have struggled alot with the lack of resources, be it; Dennies, Character Level up(thingies), Skill level up materials, Disk level up(thingies)and You name it... I think that nornally comes down to the fact that this isn't and open world game where you can collect items from chests, and im guessing that the devs forgot about that and imitated the reward system of Genshin and brought it here... Now this system does not really leave much room for error in building your team...

2. What's up with duplicate shops that are litwrally useless? And why are there shops that can be utilized, but are not?

Duplicate shops, 
a. Why are there 2 cafes with the exact same daily buff?If you are gonna drink coffee like only once a day? Like maybe allow once per cafe or something?

b. Why are there 2 noodle shops, with the same menu?Maybe offer other stat buffs in the Lumina square noodle shop?(crit dmg, crit rate, anomaly proficiency/mastery) 

c. Why are there 2 newsstands if I can only scratch once a day? maybe add something unique in the second newsstand

d. Why is 141 Convenience Store such a scam?and why do both stores share the same stock?like they both run out of stock if I bought everything in one store...

Shops you can utilize,

Duyi Acupuncture, maybe like be able to buff certain specific characters? Or allow them access to their Hollow Zero perk, outisde of Hollow Zero?

Dew Gardening Shop, maybe buy flowers and decorate the surroundings of the shop? Or your room?

Teamilk shop, I honestly dont have any idea for this one....

And please, remove metro station 🤣😂Literally just infrastracture wasting storage space in my phone...

For context, I'm from India and from a moderately conservative family. I've never been in a relationship before and this is the closest I've ever been to dating anyone and this was a long distance thing at that. 
Things were going quite well until around the 6 month mark, I got into a new job and things got a bit more busy for me. We met around 4 times in the last 4 months when he was in town. All coffee dates, short ones. Arounf this time I sort of felt that the feelings we initially had were waning off and felt like bith of us werent interested enough. The last time we met I brought up the topic of where this was headed and how he felt about me. Contrary to what I thought, he said he felt very sure about me and that he felt it ever since we met for the first time. He went on to say things implying that he could find a job if it meant he could get married to me and basically made me feel like I was somehow pressuring him into be someone he was not just for me, which I wasn't trying to do. Ever since that I've been feeling sort of detached and honestly bored of it. And after that he said he'll call me on phone (we've never done that before, we always text each other)  to tell me some things but he never got around to doing that. I feel very conflicted on where to go from here. Our conversations have been very sparse and boring ever since and I feel like I might be wasting his time because I don't share his feelings.  

I need advice on how to deal with this.

1g8seav,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1g8seav/get_out_from_behind_your_desk_to_manage_gmat/,"Get Out From Behind Your Desk to Manage ""GMAT Stress"" ","The GMAT preparation process is inherently pressure-filled. So, if you prepare for the GMAT for months, as most test-takers must, you need to find ways to blow off steam. Stepping away from your desk and getting your body moving is a great way to do that.

Exercise is a scientifically proven stress-reducer. It both lowers the level of the stress hormone cortisol in your body and stimulates endorphin production, improving your mood. Exercise also provides an energy boost and helps regulate sleep.

Even if you can get in only a 20-minute run, you’ll feel the benefits! So, try to make your preferred method of regular exercise a part of your schedule. Consider it another facet of your GMAT prep!

Additionally, a simple change of scenery can be helpful in overcoming GMAT stress. Between work or school and GMAT prep, spending hours upon hours seated at a desk each day can make us feel physically and mentally sluggish. So, if you’re dealing with GMAT stress, it might be time to mix things up.

For example, if the weather is nice, instead of studying at home on Saturday morning, grab a cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop and find a quiet spot to study at a local park. If you’re using flashcards to aid your GMAT prep, why not take a stroll around your neighborhood while you quiz yourself with them?

The point is, doing the same thing day in and day out can make preparing for the GMAT feel like a grind. That feeling breeds stress. So, get out from behind your desk, get moving, and get a change of scenery. You may be surprised how refreshed you feel when you do!

I don’t know if your letter about dreams is for me or for him. It made me sad. I want you to live your dreams.

And maybe you will. Sooner than you think. And it won’t end, like you think it will.

How could I walk away from the spectacular sunset you are?

Im older and wiser and this time is THE time. No obstacle will change that.

You write to him, think about him and Im still here. Still waiting. No pressure or anything.

This time nothing will stop me.

No one could love me like you love me. And I don’t think I’d love anyone else like i love you.

Im pretty sure you’re the one Im supposed to be with.

I was always drawn to you without really knowing you but after my trauma revelations, Im even more sure of it.

I feel bad because you deserve better than me but I’ll try to rise to the occasion.

I’ll treat your heart tenderly because you’re so so important to me (yeah, i realize right now that’s not exactly happening because i get confused about what is happening, in person it will be so much easier to anticipate things)

I’ll talk to you about every problem and try to explain my side so misunderstandings don’t compound between us.

I’ll be affectionate and cuddly every day cause I’m a touch kind of person and you are too right?

Imagine sleepy mornings where i bring you your coffee in bed and whatever else you would like ( i don’t know your favourite breakfast items :() and we stay in bed and talk and cuddle and fool around.

Imagine not being alone ever cause im like a puppy and will follow you wherever you go.

Imagine being able to share your pain with me so it’s easier to bear.

I personally can’t wait to fall asleep beside you, holding you close and whispering things in your ear.

I’ve never had that and always wanted it. To sleep next to someone you love. Feel them in the night.

Imagine having the life you always dreamed of, just not with the person you always dreamed of it with.

Maybe who you thought was the right person, wasn’t the right person after all.

He just made it seem that way to hide you from who you were actually supposed to be with.

But it’s very difficult to see that, not your fault at all

Anyway, it’s morning. You made it through the night. Did you get any sleep?

If not, there’s always naps. Sometimes naps are better.

I miss you and I love you

I hope today you get some hope back

And I know, one day your dreams will come true

Ill make it happen

1g8scgj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g8scgj,Anyone have any advice ,"This boys name is Brantley. I just got him from a shelter. He’s a fantastic guy. He’s only a year old or so and he’s very intelligent. But sometimes certain behaviors don’t exhibit at shelters and in his own case, this behavior was separation anxiety. This boy is TERRIFIED that I’m just going to leave him and never return. It breaks my heart. To me, it’s fantastic that he loves me so much. I don’t get it, he probably likes me more than I like me..but separation anxiety to the extent he has it, it’s concerning. For one, I’ve taken off work to help him adjust but I do eventually have to go back. I don’t think he’s going to be able to handle it though. If I put food and water out for him, he’ll not touch a crumb or drop of it unless he can have his eyes on me the entire time. If his back is to me, he’ll eat/drink for a second and then have to turn around and make sure I’m still in eye shot. Sleeping has been a big problem too. It’s not so much that he’s not tired, he gets PLENTY of exercise, (although I’ll admit that maybe a bit more mental stimulation would benefit him at this point. I’m currently waiting on some interactive toys from Amazon) ..he’s definitely exhausted. He’s barely slept since he got here. But he goes to sleep and then every couple of minutes, 30 is the LONGEST he’s slept without waking up, he scares himself awake and checks to make sure I’m around. If he doesn’t see me because it’s dark, he whines. Last night he got me up around 12:40 am bc he had to use the bathroom, I took him out and walked him and he did his business immediately but I walked him a little more after I’d noticed the entire time we’d been in bed that he was restless. We got back and he then stayed up until like 3:30 am. He was self soothing by sucking on his blanket at first and then that switched to excessively chewing on stuff. Not his toys mind you. No, he thought the coffee table was better suited for that. I redirected his attention a few times and I gave him stuff that he was allowed to chew up, that seemed to soothe him for a while. They don’t recommend training for a while after adoption. I’ve already been in contact with a training and boarding place that he’ll eventually start. I understand completely that he’s going to need plenty of time to adjust and that it may take him quite some time. But I don’t want him to miss out on being a dog because he’s terrified of me leaving. I also can’t stand the idea of him not eating or drinking when I leave the house or him wailing and crying if he thinks I’m gone. I just need help. This boy loves me. And I love him. I want to be as patient as possible but knowing I have to go back to work eventually and knowing how long it can take to get dogs out of this, it’s a little disheartening I won’t lie. I just want him to thrive here. I want him to know I love him just as much if not more than he loves me. If anyone has any suggestions…lay them on me. I’ve had mastiffs before, well one anyway but it’s been a long time and Fred was quite different in just about every way. I’m already trying the training thing where I have him wait and then call him over. He actually did that a couple times before his little self couldn’t stand it anymore and his nerves got the best of him. That’s fine. I understand it takes a lot to overcome panic. Bc I have it myself. I’m also trying where I make him stay in my bedroom and tell him I’ll be right back and just leave for a little bit and come right back so he associates those words with the fact that I’ll be back. I’m not sure that one of the Kong toys will even work when it gets here because the toys he brought, his food, his treats, none of that concerns him if he thinks I’m about to walk away. It doesn’t even have to be out of the house, just out of sight. I’m desperate right now. The very last thing I wanna do is take him back. I have really close neighbors though and I can’t leave him here if he’s going nuts. Some barking and wailing I can handle but not at this level. He wasn’t a barker at all in the beginning. He was very dog social. It’s completely changed now. Is it me?? What do I do? Thank you for all your help. ",5,1729524293.0,Mastiff,0,1.0,False

You can ask me anything about my experience.** 

*Why am I doing this?*

I spent a considerable amount of time studying **myself** after this. I found the whole thing incredibly interesting as a psychological phenomenon, how I fell for someone like him. Along the way, I gained a lot of knowledge on narcissistic relationships and on how these people operate. I'm happy to offer support or encouragement to anyone who needs it now or share what I've learnt. I think this whole experience, even if very tough, made my life richer, myself, more grateful, and my new relationship better for it. 

  
*Here's a condensed version of my (very typical) story:*

I was 25 when I met him, and life was going great—I’d landed a permanent job in Europe, bought an apartment, was fit and felt really pretty. He followed me on Instagram. For weeks, I watched his stories and he piqued my interest: successful, good-looking, into design, sporty, often posting his family, and a dog dad.

Eventually, he slid into my DMs, and we met for coffee. After that first date, he told me he was “smitten” and proceeded to court me with (what seemed like) so much intention, ask me to be his girlfriend, and invite me on a holiday with his family half across the world, all within 1 month of meeting each other. It felt intense but I found him charismatic and attractive, was drawn to his self-made success, and went with it.  
  
But that family holiday, two months in, was when things started to crack. What followed was a year of emotional chaos: word salad, confusing conversations, criticism over things he initially admired (my body, my sensitivity, my emotional maturity). Gaslighting wasn’t the obvious ""I never said that"", but a more subtle “It’s not what I meant,” which left me questioning myself. There were many double standards—he could do things I couldn’t, and I just couldn't figure out a way to be good enough for him. \*One thing I realise was **not** textbook, there was no social isolation. I think it's because my close friendships mean absolutely everything to me and he must've sensed there was no chance this would fly by me.

Each time I tried to leave him, he’d turn to that ""smitten"" version of himself, for which I repeatedly fell. In time, I learned to stand up for myself and thickened my skin, only to be eventually countered with his infidelity. I knew that being upfront wouldn’t work, so I ended up pretending to concede to him as though yes, he was right all along, I didn't deserve the great man that he was, I was broken and miserable, and he deserved someone happy and positive. That kinda worked, and he let me go.

Of course, he then tried to come back dozens of times, his most preferred strategy being that I've always been ""the one"" and he'll never forgive himself for losing me. To this day, he tries to reach out sometimes through a different means of communication where I've not yet blocked him. I find it kinda flattering now and laughable, but at the time it was exhausting. 

The separation felt like detoxing from a drug. I missed him deeply, but I also knew I had to leave, I felt I owed it to the women in my family who weren't particularly happy in the love department and I didn't want to be like them. I think it impacted my health—tonsillitis, fibromioma, severe acne—all these weird things started kicking in as my body started defrosting from the freeze state.

Since then, I’ve seen two close friends—both self-aware, kind, bright women—fall for narcissist guys. It's true they often target people with strength, not weakness. If you’re going through this, chances are, you’ve got the stamp of a good person all over you, too. :)",1,1729524115.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,1.0,False

I took the grandson with me so she could see him. He is 2. Obviously, she has not seen him because I’ve been staying away and so has my whole family because we’re all scared of her. 
This is the message she left me: 

Hi (blank)  (she says my name super sarcastic)You big bitch You bring back all my Christmas so much you stole from me all of them and I mean all of them I'm tired of this shit . I'm tired of my utensils Civil War(civil war is what my phone translated her words to not sure why)  everything you miss stealing you bring it all back you bitch…” end of message 

She then calls again. I answer… I know, dumb…
Says the same stuff and now she is calling the police.  Y’all think the police will really come? What the f#ck do I do now? Beg my siblings to call the a committal?  They seem like we shld just deal with it. But it is not them. Yes here and there she has went off on them. But nothing like she has to my son and myself..see my previous post. 

No I did not steal her coffee cup, jewelry, Christmas decorations, glasses, coffee, sugar, dog, leashes, and whatever else she came up with.  I might add most of the time my sister finds said items… but mom never remembers. She then stashes it all over again.  So I can’t find it 😔 sigh 
I may add my mom is so young (73) but has had multiple surgeries to her spine and at one point had a broken neck. So I’m assuming long-term anesthesia has played apart and some of this. Any who… 😑🥹

OVERVIEW
We are a bit more unconventional compared to this sub, as you'll see with our itinerary.

-Day 1: arrive Paris, overnight Paris

-Day 2: train to Munich, Munich overnight

Day 3: Oktoberfest, train to breganz, train to lugano, lugano overnight

Day 4: lugano to Florence train

Day 4- Day 9: Florence

Day 9: train/ferry to Maiori 

Day 9- 14: Maiori stay

Day 14-19: train to Rome, Rome fly out

The front end was fast paced, and exciting. We slept in a new place each night. Took trains all over. Got to see so much in a short time. Our average daily steps were around 24k.

Florence is one of my favorite cities. And we slowed down and took it all in. We also did a day trip to Verona.

On the amafi coast, we laid on the beach for 3 days (found two beach chairs for 10 euros each) and then had a boat tour of the coast.

And in Rome, we did food tours, walked a huge portion of the city, and went back to a few historic sites We've seen already (vatican, colluseum, castle, and pantheon)

SPECIFIC TIPS WITH TODDLERS
1. We brought a double stoller (baby jogger city tour 2), and it was the best decision ever. Both our kids took naps in it while on the go. It's only 25in wide, which is as wide as most tandems. It's lightweight, tri folds, and easy to maneuver. The wheels held up but took a beating in Italy. I couldn't imagine trying to baby carry our 3 year old for hours. The stroller fit in every elevator (when there were elevators) and when there wasn't one, my oldest got out and walked the stairs while my wife and I carried our youngest in the stoller/ in her carrier down the stairs. Florence was the most difficult with a stoller due to the random sizes of side walks, but that was mostly in the touristy areas. In Paris, our airbnb didn't have an elevator, so we left our stoller at the bottom in a storage area the airbnb had. The stoller was a breeze to carry compared to our carry-on rolling luggage. We even brought our double stoller to the colluseum without any issue. When we took the metro in Paris, I simply just folded and put it over my shoulder. Easy process with gate checking. It is especially important for our kids to nap after we landed due to the time change - and the stoller lays flat. 


2. We brought a small portable sound machine - our kids slept through all of the choas. However, the ambulance and police sirens woke them.


3. We're morning people, and we got to all the historical sites before or at opening. It was incredible the difference in crowds. Highly recommend considering going early with kids. At Castle Sant Angelo, we walked in at opening without tickets and had the whole upper level to ourselves for about 30 minutes.


4. Most days were structured like this: walk to get espresso and light breakfast by 730-8am. See a historical site. Stoller nap for youngest. Visit a local playground for the kids to get out energy. Grab a takeaway or sit down lunch. Back to the airbnb around 1pm when it's hot, rest for a few hours while kids napped again. We got airbnbs with patios, which was great for this. Visit a historical site in the afternoon/early evening. Or go out for early dinner.

5. We had no issues going out to eat at 5-6pm. It was not crowded too, which was great for us.

6. We talked to so many people with kids at the playgrounds. And so many Italians (especially older) were so kind and stopped to say hi to our kids. We found all of the locals to be wonderful towards young kids, especially when we went to grocery stores / areas outside high tourist zones.

7. My kids love the trains, especially walking around to the food car. And we booked seats in family cars, where the stoller could be set up - which was great for naps

8. The flight we had we had, we economy with 3 seats across. My oldest had room to lay down on us in middle seat (with her seat belt on of course!) And youngest kind of slept in baby carrier (this was the hardest part - she did not enjoy the carrier very much - YMMV)

9. Tablet + cheap wireless headphones + bluey entertained our oldest on the plane. We're not huge on screens, but that was necessary.

10. My kids tried a lot of food, but ultimately didn't each much at restaurants. We mostly bought them food from grocery stores.

11. Airbnb with a fridge and kitchen was clutch. As was having a washer.

12. Anytime the kids were acting out, we just took them to an open park or playground. Parco giochi D'Azeglio in Florence was our go-to. Maiori had a park right in the central boardwalk. In Rome Parco giochi and the playground at Villa Borghese were our go tos. My wife and I brought a mini portable blanket and would often just lay out and have a picnic while the kids played. Lugano had an incredible park right on the lakefront and at the top when we took the funicular.

13. My oldest is fine in a bed, and we used pillows to create bumpers. My youngest slept in a nap tent. It was clutch peapod i think is the brand. Some places didn't have pack n plays. It's super small and light.

14. My wife used a large fanny pack as a diaper bag. My oldest is potty trained, so it was mainly for our youngest.

15. We brought a 20-oz yeti to keep milk cold on the go.

16. I used a pakt carry on 40L, my wife used an osprey 35L, and we had a rolling carry-on that held all the kids' stuff. Having no checked bags made things super smooth. At the airport, there were family lines that expedited the process for customs/passport control.

17. This is obvious, but it was very easy to find all baby supplies (diapers, wipes, etc). we packed enough for 5 days and just bought as we went along on our trip.

18. We had two light umbrellas - I would hold one for my wife and I, and we'd put the other over the stoller. Kept us mostly dry in light to moderate rain.

19. Hotels we stayed in - we loved having a divder wall (Maiori) - my wife and I could have adult time, watch a movie in bed, or sit on the patio and just unwind.

NON KID SPECIFIC TIPS
1. Mint mobile international data add-on worked surprisingly well. I had left over data at the end.
2. We averaged about 9 miles walking every day. In Italy, we could have taken the bus, but it was often jam-packed full. Paris metro was hard but fo able.
3. Vacation for us is exploring, with a day or two for rest. This is not for everyone.
4. List of things we did: Duomo + bell tower, sun rise at piazza michalengo, rented a car and drove to Sienna, and Monteriggioni, day trip Verona, Oktoberfest, Paris: eifel tower, louve (outside), Jardin du Palais Royal. Maiori: hiked path of lemons, ferry to positano and amalfi, and boat tour. Rome: Colluseum (I did the arena floor by myself), Pantheon, Castle, and vatician - didn't go in, but saw Pope do his Wednesday talk.
5. We brought 100 in euros, used about 80.
6. Lots of mosquitos in Rome. No big deal, just couldn't leave the windows open for fresh air.
7. Luggage storage in Munich and Breganz worked well.

BIGGEST CHALLENGES

1. Youngest didn't want to sleep on the plane. She was running around like a maniac. Didn't like the carrier naps.
2. The few nights we were up late, the kids started acting out, crying/screaming. Made for a bad time 😂 
3. In Italy, it felt like no one served food (other than bread/pastry) before 9 am.
4. My oldest got motion sickness and vomited on the bus (aka the vomit bus) on the amalfi coast.
5. Generally, it's just a pain constantly washing /cleaning my youngest milk bottle. Comes with the territory. And it is definitely challenging with all the naps - I had a full spreadsheet that I used to help us, but just lots and lots of planning. We couldn't be as spontaneous as we'd like, but again, that comes with having kids.

All in all, it was a great trip. It was our third time in Italy and second in Paris. I think we're at like 23 or 24 countries at this point. But I'd highly recommend it if you're up for the challenge. Hopefully, there was something helpful for someone in the long wall of text!",1,1729523950.0,travel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been keeping it together since I found out last week. But this morning, it finally hit me. What triggered it was something so insignificant, so stupid. I was sitting in my office at home, going through emails, and before she left for work, she brought me a mug of coffee, wished me a good day, and gave me a kiss. I realized everything I was about to lose and that was it. That was my undoing. 

All the feelings I have been successfully keeping at bay came at me in full force. The sadness, the anger, the rage. And I just bawled for hours after she left. I just thought about the life we built together over the last 12 years. I don’t know if I’ll ever get a satisfactory answer to explain how she could do this to me. I am still tracking her movements and their conversations through her iPad, which haven't stopped. They met up yesterday, initially planned to go to a motel but she ended up going to his house when his wife had to make an urgent trip to visit her sick mother. They disgust me.

I am so angry at her. At both of them. Not only do I have to contend with losing her, I am also losing a close friend. This man stood by me on our wedding day as he watched us exchange vows and he stood next to me while I buried my parents.

12 years gone down the drain because both of them couldn't keep it in their pants.

Please don’t tell me I need to leave her. I will. I still have several consultations with different lawyers to go through in the coming days before I settle on the right one and begin the divorce process. I just needed to type this out to a bunch of strangers because this is unbelievably hard and I feel as though the weight of this burden is going to crush me. I lost my parents two years ago and now I am about to lose the only family I have left. 

I am NOT ok. No, scratch that. I am pretty fucking depressed. And to top it off, I have to keep it together and maintain my act until she is served, when all I want to do is fucking scream. ",49,1729523847.0,Infidelity,30,0.98,False

I didn’t really have much symptoms so far except pain at the injection site 20 minutes after I injected, but that went away quickly. Today on day 3 I feel fine. My bowel movements have been ok. 

As far as my eating, I noticed myself eating less but not like a significant amount. For example, I noticed im not snacking in between meals anymore or before bed. I was already eating super healthy (clean foods 85% of the time) so that portion didn’t change much. I only drink water, coffee and seltzer. 

Sometimes I get a very very mild headache but thats my body’s cue to drink more water, so I do. Other than that, I feel pretty much the same. The “food noise” seems to have gotten quiet. in the past, I was very into weightlifting and going to the gym in my 20s, so I’m very used to having to think about my next meal to calculate it. so far I have not decided to track macros or count calories just yet because I wanna see what the medication does with me just being mindful while eating versus having to count everything that I eat.

I really haven’t done much exercise with the exception of doing some walks around my neighborhood because again I wanna see what the medication does with mindful eating and lessened food noise in my head.

I think that means the medication is working.. right?

A quick backstory is that I’ve had gestational diabetes with both of my pregnancies and have insulin resistance because of it and a very difficult time losing weight.  I am currently pre diabetic and was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome as well.

So something interesting I’ve observed with the Aiden. Could be a coincidence. So I’ve had it for 4 days. First brew I made with the exact same coffee and grind setting I’ve used today and same water recipe I got a flat bed. Today the bed looked less flat and more like mountains. Yesterday it was like a hole in the middle. It doesn’t seem to impact the flavor. It’s just something that made me curious to why it happens because I don’t agitate. I just shake the basket so the bed is flat after I dose the grounds in the filter. Has anyone experienced something similar? My elevation is 160ft above sea level if that matters.

**Here's a bit of background:**

I recently found out I have pcos (though I have suspected it for a while), and the first thing the doctor told me as I entered the chamber was you need to lose weight 🫠 My weight had rapidly increased from 53 kg to 58 kg, and now I am officially overweight. I was shocked myself coz I have never gone over 55 kg. 

**Here are my numbers:**

*height:* 150 cm / rounding it off to 5' because I hate using 4'11"" lol 

as of ***October 21, 2024 -***

*weight:* 58 kg / about 127 pounds (not 100% accurate as I don't remember the exact decimals after 58)

*bmr* coming at around 1,247 cals acc to online calculator.

*arms*: 12.5 inches (right) / 13 in (left)

*thighs:* 25 in (r) / 24.2 in (l)

*waist:* around 32 in

*calves:* 14 in (r) / 14.2 in (l)

**Some points for context:** 

I'm a college student, and I live by myself in a hostel so I dont have the freedom to curate all my meals to be healthy. I gotta eat what they serve for at least breakfast, but other than that i will be buying fruits (mainly bananas coz I love them, and they fulfil my sugar cravings), veggies that i don't mind eating raw, yogurt and milk. I probably eat way too much milk but that's a consideration I have to make because I am addicted to coffee and don't want to ditch it. I will, however, be reducing the amount of times I drink milk coffee)

**Now onto progress:**

* oct 18 -

started my 1 hr daily walk journey.

calories consumed - around 1200 (went high on carbs 🥲)

breakfast wasn't unhealthy per say, but had high carbs but rest were fine. except sugarcane juice (I'm not sure if it's healthy or not, would love any advice on this coz I love it)

* oct 19 -

walked 1 hour

calories consumed - around 1500 (again, high on carbs. i don't know how I can escape the carb cycle 🫠)

lunch was extremely unhealthy but the rest were goodie.

* oct 20 -

had joint pain so skipped the walk. I did walk around my room a bit, cleaning things here and there. and did a bit of light exercise.

calories consumed - around 1700. nothing was unhealthy (unless you consider cereal to be unhealthy) but failed to portion control.

* oct 21 -

1 hour walk + walked in college, managed to cross 10k steps aggregate 

calories consumed - 1900 cals. crazy. went to burger king with friends, had a lot of junk yes but I'm resilient af so let's ignore that L move 🫠 (swearing to myself rn that I'll try better tomorrow)

1g8s0mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g8s0mk/do_i_have_adhd_or_am_i_just_lazy/,Do i have ADHD or am i just lazy ?,"I (24m) already know that the only way to have a final diagnosis would be through a psychiatrist but i wanna know if I’m just trying to find a new excuse to my laziness or if it’s really something pathological, so i came here hoping to compare my experiences with people already diagnosed with ADHD.

Basically it all started a couple of weeks ago, i was going to this techno party but i didn’t wanna take mdm* because of it’s neurotoxicity (and i already had it 2 weeks prior), so i searched for an alternative which ended up being 2CB. I asked my usual dealer for 2cb but he said he didn’t have that but had amphetamines instead, so i did my research and i was like “oh cool that’s what students take to study better, I’ll try it why not”. Next day i take the pill (25mg according to the dealer) at 7pm (big mistake ik) i put some music and sat on my desk and started studying (4th year med student); about an hour later it hit me and it was mind blowing for me, it was the first time in my life that i actually feel interested in what i was studying, i usually just memorize stuff as is (which i struggle with also), but this time it felt like i really wanted to understand the reason behind everything and using AI to explain stuff more in depth than the documents i study from. But a few hours later i started getting anxious and my heart started beating harder and faster, couldn’t sleep … you know the drill. So next day i was like yep this is not for me lol and put the other pill away (i bought 2). A few days later i wanted to go study at the library so i decided to take half the pill this time and see how it goes : it went perfect little to no side effects, some waves of euphoria tho for like 10-20 min but then everything felt normal but i was able to sit still in the library for around 5-6 hours getting shit done and actually understanding. After that i searched a bit about ADHD and felt like i had some symptoms, did an online test (which i think is the most up to date one with a section A and a section B) and according to the test i have a good probability of having ADHD BUT I’m worried that i wasn’t really truthful while doing the test and just exaggerating just to get the result i wanted and that’s why I’d like to hear your opinions.

What makes me think i have ADHD : 
Procrastinated all my life-always felt i was really bad at memorizing stuff compared to my friends in school and med school-I’ve done 6 years of university so far and never once was able to focus during a lecture my mind always wanders so i ended up studying alone at cafés or home-no matter how much i study i never ever got a good grade, i always pass with less than average grades-whenever i study “well” used was when i went early to a cafe i knew, didn’t eat all day there, binge drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, and as soon as i quit smoking my productivity went downhill- i have a really addictive personality-i used to sleep a lot during classes in the last years of high-school or just did something else meanwhile-i have restless leg syndrome- introverted-i always let stuff for last minute-i get super anxious if I’m talking on the phone to someone and someone else talks to me irl, like it’s impossible for me to multitask, often when i study or read something my gf would talk to me and i would just day yeah yeah without noticing or hearing anything she said-often when i watch a complex video essay on youtube i end up having to go back because my brain shut off for like a minute-i always create a new way of studying (flashcards, highlighting, writing my own notes with different colors etc) it feels like I’m more focused on doing the method properly than focusing on the subject itself-i often sleep in cinemas (even though i love movies)-i barely have any apps on my phone cz i get really easily distracted by it-every time i have an exam i can’t wait to finish or have to pause a bit during the exam and then continue and very very rarely have i reread what i wrote-when i read book i tend to always focus on the essential and disregard everything else, or having to reread paragraphs cz i read them but without really reading them idk if it makes sense-i always forget stuff and dates (bringing book to school/ buying flight ticket for the wrong month/losing keys and wallet often etc-finally my dad (also did medschool) had the same problems as me (not going to classes, restless leg syndrome etc) but was never diagnosed and i have a cousin my age diagnosed with ADHD. 

What makes me think i don’t have ADHD : 
I’ve always been excellent in maths and physics or anything that doesn’t rely on memorizing but understanding instead-i didn’t want to do med school at first so i assumed my lack of focus was due to disinterest-i have a friend with ADHD that told me that he can’t read book but i can so … -I’ve always been very calm and not impulsive (but sometimes when i get really frustrated and i can’t keep it inside anymore i usually burst of anger but most of the time in private- i ve seen people as lazy as me- I’m succeeding in my studies even if i don’t have the best grades i just assume people with better grades are just better at memorizing and are more interested than me- i can watch 5 hours long youtube videos sometimes and watch YouTube a lot (+4000 videos saved for later and all watched) but it’s always documentaries or video essays-when I’m solving a math or physics problem i can just stay on it for hours until i find a solution-i have an addictive personality so i might be convincing myself just to get what i want",1,1729523472.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I just moved into a new house and I’m on a mission to make it smell absolutely perfect. So far, I've tried using dhoop cones (bought from Phool), and while the smell is amazing, the longevity is just not there. 



After doing a bit of research, I found that I could try an [ultrasonic aroma diffuser](https://preview.redd.it/awsof5iok4wd1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd43c4a4a250a0f700bbe0188db9b2eb1de0f6d), and I’m thinking of getting some oils from Piyush (Jashn Fragrances) or someone else in the community. 





Here are a few things I need help with:

 

1. **Which ultrasound aroma diffuser should I buy?** Any recommendations on brands that work well? Also, if I go with this, how long does the scent usually last in a room? I’m aiming for gourmandish or coffee-like fragrances—something that makes my home smell like a bakery or café.

   

2. **Reed diffusers** sound nice, but I’m skeptical about the cost versus how long the fragrance will last. Has anyone here tried them? Are they worth it?



3. I also considered **bakhoor**, but I couldn’t find anything close to coffee or bakery scents in that range, and it's a bit expensive for regular use. Any bakhoor recommendations that aren’t insanely pricey but still offer cozy, warm vibes?



4. Lastly, I’m open to **other suggestions** on how to keep my house smelling amazing. I’m all ears! 



I did try searching the sub for similar questions, but didn’t find anything comprehensive. Thanks a ton for your help in advance! Links to products are super welcome if you're recommending anything.

Sorry if this post is redundant, I did a brief search but I didn’t see exactly this. I figured I’d shoot my shot here before doing the separate city deep dives and venturing into the travel tiktoks.

A band my bf and I love will be touring in Wisconsin later this winter (we’re in NY). Debating if we should do the Madison or Milwaukee show. Would arrive on a Thurs and do at least two nights/days.

Casually asking around my east coast circle, Madison is surprisingly in the lead as “more fun.” We’re 30ish, down to spend $$$ on this experience, like good food/cocktails, thrifting, museums etc. We would prefer a conveniently located boutique hotel over an airbnb for this trip. 

A big factor is the Sylvee vs Pabst theater. It’s a band that we wouldn’t want to sit through for most of the set. Pabst appears objectively more gorgeous, but doesn’t have the GA standing room Sylvee does. 

My initial inclination was Milwaukee but logistically, I think Madison might make more sense. Would love some strong opinions - and suggestions for at least one romantic dinner spot whichever way you are swaying me! Cool coffee shops, diners, dive bars etc also welcome :)",1,1729523228.0,wisconsin,0,1.0,False

Burner because they’re on Reddit. My spouse (AMAB 39) is urinating 3-4x the normal amount. Here is relevant information:

1.) they have seen a physician and gotten bloodwork (more below). The physician ordered a 24 hour urine test, and my spouse filled two 2 gallon containers… plus some more.

2.) in the bloodwork: creatinine normal. Osmolality, BUN, Eos, thyroid, blood pressure, cholesterol high. One round of bloodwork showed elevated sodium and chloride levels, but those lowered after the next round.

3.) they are tall and heavyset, but they work out an hour a day, 5 days a week. (For their build, think Kevin Owens).

4.) they take a low dose of SSRIs (50 mg) but nothing else regularly. Just otc stuff for pain, seasonal allergies, etc.

5.) I consider their diet pretty middling. We eat the same dinners (I’m a health nut vegetarian), they’re an omnivore who loves junk food but tries their best to not have it more than one or two times a month. However, it’s possible they eat more and don’t tell me. When they do drink- which is a few times a week- they will have more than I consider to be healthy, about 3-4 servings. Because of their size, it has no effect. They drink coffee a bit, but in small amounts. They also snack a lot. However, since this started, they do not consume any alcohol or caffeine.

6.) their family does not discuss medical issues. AFAIK though, no history of kidney issues.

7.) symptoms are excessive thirst and urination, and some constipation UNLESS they drink as frequently as their body tells them to. Which also means excessive nighttime pee trips. Energy levels and activity levels normal. Appetite reduced due to anxiety. Skin tone normal (not pale or yellow or overly flushed). No sudden weight loss or gain. 

8.) their doc is out of the office and testing is still happening, but their anxiety is getting the better of them while they wait for answers. I keep telling them that if it was dire, they’d be a lot sicker, but I’m also very much not a doctor and I am mostly just trying to keep them calm. Does anyone have any thoughts?

**TIPS:**

**HOW TO IGNORE 3D:**

I see so many people asking this question almost every day here on reddit. Lucky for you, I'll explain that also. So, when someone tells you to ignore your everyday reality you try to do it and find it really difficult, which is absolutely normal and reasonable. How can you ignore your reality when you are literally living in it. Once again, you need to have a certain level of understanding of this subject in order to be able to successfully ""ignore"" your reality. What you need to know here is that there is a law of Universe, same as already mentioned law of attraction and law of gravity. That law is called ""law of gender"" and it decrees that all seeds have a gestation or an incubation period. Some fruits or vegetables need few months in order to grow, humans need 9 months in order to be born. Every seed (desire) that gets planted in your subconscious mind needs some time to finally manifest in your 3d. So let me give you an example. Let's say you don't have a job and you really want/need/desire one. You plant that seed in your mind by affirming, visualizing, having faith and all those thigs I already explained in this post. So how do you ignore your 3d? How do you ignore the fact that you don't have a job when you've been affirming that you have it, and you've been doing it with faith and conviction? You do that by getting to know about law of gender. If everything takes some time to manifest, and your current reality is the result of your past thinking (""For as he thinketh in his hearth, so is he"" - Proverbs 23:7) then it is true and a fact that you are currently experiencing the reality of your past self, but you are now different person because you've been affirming that you have a job, and you believe it and your past thinking doesn't have anything to do with your new life and your new way of thinking. So, what you see around you is because of your past, but now the reality is different, you already have a job, it just needs to arrive to you. ""For we walk by faith, not by sight"" - 2 Corinthians 5:7. You can now see that delivery of your desire is actually what is called an incubation period of law of gender. When you start to feel like you don't have a job affirm something like: ""This is because of my past thinking, in my mind I actually do have a job and I'll soon have it in my physical reality.""



**MAKE A DEFINITE DECISION:**

""Making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really driving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision""

When you become aware of your desires, and you want to see them manifested, make a decision that you are going to have it. Once you make that decision you are showing God that you are very serious about getting it. Making a commited decision is one of the major steps when it comes to manifesting. 



**HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE:**

It is so important to be able to control you own emotions and stay positive during the day. The more I learned about all of this the more I was able to control my emotions and it helped me so much. When something bad happens to me I don't let it ruin my day. There are dozens of small things that have the ability to ruin our day if we'd let them. Continue learning about the subject and also meditate and you'll soon find yourself easily controlling your feelings. Stay positive and you'll attract good things to you. Soon you'll find yourself in the loop of receiving good things. I like the story of the chinese farmer, which helped me so much in my life. Farmer had a horse which escaped from his farm and his neighbours came to him and told him ""that's bad news"", to which he said ""maybe"". The next day the horse came back, bringing with him another horse, so the farmer now had two of them, his neighbours came to him and said ""that's good news"", to which the farmer said ""maybe"". The next day farmer's son fell off the horse and broke his leg, again the neighbours came to the farmer and said ""that's bad news"" to which the farmer said ""maybe"". Then the war started and army general came to the village to recruit all the young healthy man to bring them to war and because the farmer's son broke his leg, he didn't go to war. The neighbours came to the fa... You already know how it goes by now. So yeah, everything happens for a reason. ""And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them - Romans 8:28"". Decide now to believe that everything that happens to you is for you own good, because we as humans have limited minds and we can't know for sure why are some things happening. Then we often go and play victims asking the God ""Why is this happening to me? Why me?"" when in reality it would all for our own good, only if we had faith that it will end that way. ""Trust in the Lord with all your hearth, and lean not on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight - Proverbs 3:5-6"". I like the story of famous streamer and youtuber Fanum. He said he finished high school, went to college but only went there for a short time because he didn't like it and didn't have money to buy books. One day, as he was going back home his phone fell down and broke. He didn't have 80 dollars to fix it and then he said ""let me try this youtube shit"". Now he earns millions of dollars and he is living his best life. Breaking your phone while being broke to the point where you are not able to fix it is something that would make a lot of people in his position lose their minds. Once again, we as humans often don't understand why are certain things happening, but if we have faith and positive attitude, we will soon understand why those things happen. ""You don't understand now what I am doing, but later you will understand - John 13:7"".



**GOD'S TESTS:**

The God will test you. It actually all depends on what you're manifesting because in my opinion, God's tests are directly connected to the level/amount of faith you need to have in order to receive your manifestation. If you are manifesting a coffee, seeing something or someone, getting a good grade or something like that God will probably just let you have it because things like those take much smaller amount of faith in yourself and in God. Of course, he won't give you that either if you have literally 0 faith. On the other hand, if you are manifesting millions of dollars and wealth, you perfect partner, a new house or something much bigger than a coffee in this example, be sure that God will put you to some testing. It is completely normal and as I understand it, it is necessary because in moments like those, when we are tested we actually show our faith. We actually show whether we really believe that our desires can be ours. Faith is the most important emotion/ingredient when it comes to manifesting. ""FAITH is the basis of all ""miracles"", and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science! FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE!"" 

Now, as I said, it all depends on what you are manifesting and how big are your desires. I want to take this chance to say that I see a lot of people here dreaming too small. I understand, most of the people here are new to this but they are manifesting things that are so small that personally, I wouldn't even spend my energy on manifesting that when I can invest that energy into manifesting and getting something much better and worthwhile. The thing is that there are literally hundreds of stories of people manifesting wealth, love, abundance, prosperity in all forms etc and then people are dreaming much smaller than that. Sometimes I feel like that is bad way of using your knowledge about law of attraction. You can get literally (almost) whatever you want and y'all are using it for small things. But yeah, do with it whatever you want.



**BREAKING POINT:**

A lot of people start to lose faith when the thing they desire takes some time to manifest. That is completely normal, because as I already wrote it, that is God testing you. What people usually do is they give up in those moments. At that point in time, you need to show your faith and stay positive because it is very likely it is a test after which God gives you the thing you desire, only if you pass that test. ""More than five hundred of the most successful men this country had ever known, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach""

""Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the world tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward that dream. That's the point at which most people give up. It's the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon. Every search begins with beginner's luck. And every search ends with the victor's being severely tested.""

From this quote you can also learn that when you start applying law of attraction consciously to get your desires you meet with some beginner's luck. In the past week, I saw maybe a dozen of posts of the people saying that they were successfully manifesting things when they just learned about law of attraction, but now things aren't going their way. It is most likely because either God is testing them somehow or they are currently in analysis paralysis which I already mentioned and because of that they started to doubt themselves and temporarily lost their ability to successfully manifest. Sometimes it's much better to know less things. As I said, if you just knew the basics of it and had faith you would be manifesting like crazy. Law of attraction is not complicated, like at all, people nowadays just make it seem like that, in most cases just to get money out of your pocket by selling you some courses and offering you their coaching.

.

.

.

**Final message:** My final message for you is to have fun with manifesting. It's something that should be fun and calming to do, it definitely shouldn't make you feel anxious and frustrated. If you are feeling negative emotions when you manifest stop it immediately because you are doing it in vain and you are not doing it the right way. When you do it, do it like a child, you are literally role playing your new self. Yeah, just enjoy the process that's all I got to say for this post.



**Books I recommend:**

3) Ask and it is given by Neville Goddard

4) The secret by Rhonda Byrne

Most players love the game and the uniqueness, and it has  about 13,5 K visits so far, but traffic comes in spurts, so there is not always players. It is a donation game , but not your typical boring donation game. Players can play how they want, or roleplay. when a player donates they can unlock certain effects to perform on that player. This includes giving the temp items like a crown, wings, changing their head, sending a tornado or lightning at them, (There are many more items). Certain businesses players claim give temp rewards to the player that donated such as a coffee, donut, wad of cash, Candy and so forth. 

It seems like Roblox is starting to show the game in recommended more as traffic is picking up and players are telling me that is where they saw it. Realize the game is functional , but is still a work in progress, i need to work on the map a bit more and add more features, detail and tidy up. It seems like the game is ready to explode at any time and this is happening quite fast. I already have several plans, but I would appreciate feed back on the game as to what I should focus on first as my time is limited.

We booked in WTP, and I am Silver status.

First leg: EDI-LHR. After asking nicely, all 3 of us were allowed through Fast Track for security. They also let the 3 of us into the lounge which was very much appreciated.

Flight to LHR landed at T5 on time but then there was some weird shenanigans. Firstly, the plane couldn't access the gate because another plane had somehow managed to reverse onto the grass when exiting and needed to be moved using what looked like a remote control skateboard as all it's electrics had failed.  This delayed us about 30 mins.

Then, when the gate was finally cleared we were told we couldn't get off until some bags were unloaded ""because they are all loaded in the back and if you get off the plane will tip up"".  Is this an actual thing? Are planes really not heavier than bags by some margin??!  This added another 15 mins or so.

Eventually we were let off and had about 45 mins to get our connection, which made me very nervous even though it was also going from T5. But once we got through the boarding pass scanning gates at Flight Connections I knew we were OK.

Weirdly (at least to me) the JFK flight went from an A gate and we didn't need to go through any security or bag checks, so actually it didn't take long to get to the plane and it wasn't boarding by the time we go there. Missed out on any LHR lounge access though, as we had no time.

The WTP cabin was pretty good I thought. Definitely a much more spacious feel than Economy, and a decent recline on the seats. Food and drink service was fine, although one attendant seemed very grumpy when I went down the back and asked if I could get a (soft!) drink mid-way through the flight.

After we landed (on time) we were in line for passport control when we heard our name being called over the tannoy, telling us to contact a BA agent in the luggage hall. Turned out one of our bags didn't make it onto our plane, but the very nice agent told us that it was already loaded ready to go on the next one, and would be delivered to our hotel. He said if we needed to by anything missing then we could claim it (we only needed some pyjamas and a toothbrush for my daughter so we will claim for them). That all went pretty smoothly too, to be honest, with the case arriving in the middle of the night (the hotel didn't disturb us and I fetched it in the morning).

Return leg to LHR started well, once again we were allowed to use fast track and the Greenwich lounge at JFK (which is much nicer than LHR A lounge in my view), and the flight went entirely without incident or hitch - the flight attendants were much more engaged and fun than on the outbound, but that's luck I guess.

At LHR it was pretty busy and the receptionist at the lounge said we couldn't all come in, which we were about to accept when a kind man overheard and signed my wife in as his guest! So thanks to that kind stranger we managed to check out the LHR A lounge too, and it was definitely very full, but fine for what we needed which was a cup of coffee.

Last leg to EDI was all good and the bags made it all the way so happy days.

Overall a pretty good trip!",4,1729523024.0,BritishAirways,6,0.75,False

I asked y'all to upvote it and write your doubts and questions you want answered in the comments but it didn't go as I expected it to go, probably because it was a clickbait post so I was getting downvoted like a motherfucker lol. So because no one had any specific questions I am just going to write whatever comes to my mind, maybe there will be part 2 in which I can explain some other things I missed here. Anyways…

This will be a long post. I was writing this for 4 days. If you are to lazy to read it, that's fine, but I am suggesting you to read it because I am 100% sure somewhere in this post you'll find something that will help you connect the dots and I GUARANTEE that you'll learn at least one thing that you didn't know before. So yeah, save this post and you can read it later or after few days if you don't have the time to do it now. If you don't read it you might miss the opportunity to finally understand law of attraction. I hope that I didn't forget something and that I put all the basics about manifesting here. Because my last post didn't go well, feel free to comment if you want to know something I missed and didn't put in this post. As I already said, maybe there will be part 2?

I see a lot of people here asking weird questions so I realised a lot of you need help because you don't actually understand how this whole thing works. I am going to write everything I can think of which should in the end be all you need to manifest whatever you want. I'll do that by explaining what is manifestation, giving you my opinion of some of the biggest mistakes people usually make and giving you some extra tips in the end

Note 1: I actually don't care if you are christian, muslim, hindu or something else. I believe in one God and you can call him however you want. I don't want to go into religion too much **BUT**, I've read the Bible a little bit and I found out that it literally teaches law of attraction so there will be some Bible quotes in this post. There will also be quotes from other great books I've read. As I said, I don't want to impose certain religion to you, so if you don't like the fact that some Bible verses will appear throughout this text, you can stop reading it now.

Note 2: As I said, I was writing this post past 4 days. I had thousands of thoughts running through my mind so I apologize if this post is a bit ""messy"". There are a lot of things that I wanted to say and I tried to express my thoughts in the most organized way possible, so I hope that this post will be easy to understand and that I didn't make it too complicated.

# What is manifesting/manifestation and law of attraction?

First things first, I see a lot of people do not understand what manifesting actually is. It's related to famous Law of attraction which states that we attract in our lives that which we are vibrationally aligned with. One really easy example to understand this is looking at the people you are close with, your friends and people you spend your time with. You are vibrationally aligned with them so that is why you have good relationship with them. Even when you meet new people and become friends with them, you can say you manifested them because you attracted them. That being said, manifesting is not something that you do as some form of activity, hobby, or job. Manifesting is same as breathing, beating of your hearth, blinking etc. It is automatic and you are manifesting ALL THE TIME, even when you sleep. The reason for that is that you are at every moment vibrating on the certain frequency, depending on your emotions and thoughts and law of attraction is at work every second of time, exactly the same as law of gravity or other laws of the Universe. There is 2 types of manifestations - unconscious (which most people use without even knowing it, because you don't need to know about law of attraction in order for it to work or use it) and conscious (which probably all people here on this subreddit use to manifest what they desire).

**Most people don't get what they want...**

So many people on this subreddit don't get what they want because they keep repeating same basic mistakes, so now I am going to try to name every single mistake people usually do (or at least most of them) and explain to you exactly what you have to do in order to fix it.

**1. MISTAKE - BEING DESPERATE/ATTACHED**

I saw a lot of people here saying something like ""please I need help, I've been manifesting my sp for 7 months now and even tho I saw some movement in the beginning now things are way worse, I am getting desperate and depressed please tell me what I've been doing wrong. I am doing affirmations, 369 method, water method, candle method and I detached from the outcome.""

What's wrong here is that you can't manifest anything while you are depressed or desperate. When you are feeling this way you are literally saying that you don't have that thing you want so it makes you feel bad and you feel lack of that thing and that's why your desires are running away from you. Also, one mistake is only for methods, I'll speak about that later. If you were really detached you wouldn't be doing all those methods, think logically about it for a second. Do rich people affirm ""I am rich"", do famous people affirm ""I am famous"" etc? The thing is that being attached creates the resistance in your mind, that resistance blocks all the positive energy to come and flow through you and you are not able to intuitively receive ideas and get hints from God and the Universe.

So the main question right now is how do I detach? You detach by:

***1) understanding the law***

***2) having faith in yourself and in God/Universe***

**1) Understanding the law**

Here you need to understand desire part of law of attraction. What you desire desires you. Now I may disappoint you in the beginning already, this is not true for your sp. If you desire them it doesn't mean they desire you back, and the reason is very simple - they have free will exactly like you do. What you desire desires you is true for material things and stuff like that but you can't manipulate someone into liking you if they don't like you. It is possible but you shouldn't be doing it. Imagine someone doing that for you, trying to manifest a relationship with you when you don't even like them. So, that being said, there is a difference between wishing for something and desiring it. Every desire was once a wish but by constantly thinking about it, it became a burning desire within you. When that happens God/Universe wants you to have it and you can say it is God's vision or plan for you. ""Whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the Universe. It's your mission on earth."" ""When a person really desires something, all the Universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream."". Messi and Ronaldo desired to be professional football players, Jordan and Lebron desire to be professional basketball players, rich people desire to be rich. If they only wished for it, it probably wouldn't happen. Wishing and wanting are different than desire. If someone came to you and asked you ""Would you like to know how to solve Rubik's cube?"" you would probably say either ""No"" or ""I wish I could solve it, that would be so cool"" but you don't desire it (wish it enough) in order to actually take some action and learn how to do it. But if you could snap you fingers and immediately learn it, you would probably do it, because why not? So that is the difference between wishing and desiring it. Once you understand that if you desire something God wants you to have it, it is easier to detach from it because you know it is something that God plans to turn into your reality, only if you would let it.

2) **H*****aving faith in yourself and in God/Universe***

The more faith you have in God, the easier it will be to let it go and trust the process. Your desires can be compared to ordering food or new clothes. When you order something you don't think about whether it will come to you or not, you KNOW it will. You don't doubt it, you are relaxed. Especially when it comes to buying new clothes or shoes you are probably excited and you can't wait for it to come so you can wear it. Now, when you order something you know it is yours, it just didn't arrive yet. That food or package or whatever has your name and address on it, it belongs to you and that is why they deliver it to you, not to your neighbour or someone else. The same thing with your desires, they are yours. Okay, if you desire to be professional football player, you share your desire with many other people so it's not like only you have it, but if you ask 100 people on the street what do they desire answers would be very different. The point is that you desire something for a reason, and those desires are yours, not someone else's. God knows your desires and when you get clear about them, set the attention that you want them, you can look at it as ordering it from God/Universe, then you just need faith (and maybe some work) and if you don't doubt it but you know it is yours, it will become yours.

Detaching doesn't mean giving up on it or completely stop thinking about it or trying to get it. It means having attitude that even if it doesn't happen you'll be just fine, with or without it. Because when you have that attitude you stop needing it, you don't need that thing to be happy in life and then God can finally bring it to you. You don't need that thing because you already have it, it is yours, it just needs to arrive. So be joyful in that fact. That is also my understanding of living in the end. You now it's yours but you don't need to act like you literally already have it in 3d, because you don't. It was very confusing for me when people said ""act like you already have it"". Bro, if I already had my desire in 3d I would be buying mansions, yachts and cars, I would be travelling the world with family and friends, instead I am going to college lol. Trying to act like you already have it and get the feelings you would have if it's yours will probably, in most cases, only lead you to experiencing lack of that thing.

**NOTE:** That is why you see so many success stories and then you see they manifested a coffee, cake, seeing specific thing or something like that. That is very likely to happen because it is easier to believe you'll get a coffee that it is to believe you'll get a million dollars, so detachment from it is a lot easier which removes doubts and lets the God/Universe do its thing to bring it to you. Detachment is directly connected to faith. More faith you have, the easier it will be to detach and let the thing you desire come to you.

**2. MISTAKE - PUTTING METHODS ON PEDESTAL**

This is maybe the biggest mistake people usually do, especially when they just found out about law of attraction and manifesting. They read somewhere that someone manifested their desire by doing the 369 method, and then they think ""369 method definitely works, I'll do that"". And then they do it, which is fine by itself, the problem is the first mistake - they do it attached and with the wrong attitude. 99% of the successful conscious manifestations are faith and right attitude, maybe 1% is the method you use. You see some people say affirmations work for them, others say it's visualization and yet others say it's some third method. To be completely honest you don't need a method or technique in order to manifest something, because as I already said, you manifest all the time by being unconscious of that. So, even when you weren't aware of law of attraction and manifesting you didn't know what you were doing but yet you manifested your life. You didn't use any methods but somehow you manifested your reality. Needing methods is like saying you need to know about law of gravity in order for it to work on you and pull you back down when you jump up. It doesn't matter if the law if physical (like law of gravity which you can physically feel) or mental/spiritual (which you can't see and feel physically), the law is the law. So, what so many people do is they choose the method and then they think method will do it for them, method will manifest their desire. Methods don't have any power, unless we give it to them. So many people put methods on pedestal thinking that methods are somehow more important than them, when in reality the power to manifest is within you, and it's your thinking, feeling and faith, the power is not in some stupid method. If you REALLY believe that staring at your room's wall and saying your desire backwards 10 times exactly at 10 pm will manifest your desire then it will, but you have to believe it 100% without doubting. That being said, it is you, not the method. Am I saying not to use any methods? Not really, you can use some methods but it is important not to put them on pedestal and think that methods are more important than your attitude and state of mind, because they are not. You can definitely manifest anything without using the methods, at least methods like 369, water method, candle method, LITE method or something silly like that. What I always recommend is affirmations, visualization and vision boards. When you think about it, it's really basic stuff when it comes to manifesting. Affirmations are basically your self talk, which everyone does in their mind or out loud. We all constantly speak to ourselves every day. So you've actually been doing this method whole your life. Do you know understand why those methods are not something special? Same thing with visualization/imagination, you've been playing with it since your childhood, you are constantly creating fake scenarios in your mind. And yeah, I like vision boards because they are easy to make and it's like guidance to your mind to know where to take you. It's basically setting your goals, just instead of writing it as a list on a piece of paper you take pictures and make a nice vision board. You just look at it few times a day, remind yourself where you are going and that's it, you don't think about it too much. So yeah, vision boards are just like a reminder for me.

***ACTION:***

Before explaining affirmations, I just want to speak a little about action. Some people say you need to take action and some people say you don't need to and that your desire will come to you instead of you running after it. Both are correct. If you are manifesting something like smaller amount of money or a trip or something like that it is likely that it will find you and you will one day just get the money or get the trip ""out of thin air"". But on the other hand if you want something specific like being a state champion in tennis, you have to take action by training hard. It's more like preparing yourself so you can be ready when opportunity arrives to you. Sometimes the thing you desire doesn't come to you directly. In this case it would probably come to you as an invite to some tennis tournament in which you can participate and win it because by training you are now prepared for it. Basically it all just depends on what you're manifesting. What I would suggest is to take some small actions every time, if you can. Going back to new shoes example, when you order new shoes you probably throw away the old ones, give them to someone, you make space for them in your closet etc. If you want to take a trip to let's say Africa, then plan how you'll spend your time there, what places you'll visit etc. Because you ordered your desire from God and you know it's coming, then you should prepare yourself to receive it, right? If you are going to the beach or swimming pool you put on your trunks or swimming suit, you bring cold beverages, towels, balls, sunscreen etc. You prepare yourself because you know you'll need those things. In the same way, take action by preparing yourself to receive your desires. By doing that, you also show your faith to God and you tell him that you are ready for your desires, you expect them to come to you soon, because they are on their way.

**NOTE:** You must take action with the positive attitude and with faith and expectancy. If you take action but you don't believe in yourself or in God then it's useless. Again, you build your faith by learning and understanding.

***AFFIRMATIONS:***

""The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit"" - Proverbs 18:21

Now, doing affirmations the certain way is not a mistake. Some people say that robotic affirmations works for them, other people say it doesn't work. So again you see how believing that something works is more important than the thing/method itself. Here I just want to say what I think is the best way to affirm. As I said, for me affirmations are basically just self talk, positive or negative. What I like to do is do them by thinking logically. You can do that if you understand the law well enough and have faith in what you are studying. For example, you want to win that tennis tournament and be champion. You can affirm something like this: ""My desire is to be a champion, if that is my desire then God wants me to have it. Therefore in my head I already am champion and I will soon be one in my physical reality."" or something like this idk, play with it. Basically what you are doing is giving your mind concrete reasons for why you are already a champion, in the form of positive self talk, which I think makes your subconscious mind accept the idea faster. If you ask me, you don't need to affirm in front of the mirror or robotically just to convince your mind you have it. You don't affirm to convince yourself that you have it, you affirm it because you do already have it, it is ordered and it is yours. Because of that you can also affirm by being grateful, for example: ""Thank you God for giving me an opportunity to be a tennis champion"", again you just need to understand the law and how it works and you'll know that you already are champion and that can make you feel grateful for it even before it happens in your 3d reality. Also don't worry about affirming it in the present moment or in the future. Affirmations, as other methods are just vehicles that take you to the feeling of being or having what you desire. If you affirm ""I will be a champion"" and you believe it and feel like one already, then it will happen. If that makes it more believable to you then affirm it that way, whatever makes you feel better. Emotions (your faith and conviction) are more important than words. So now hopefully you understand why you can affirm something with ""I am"" but also feel like it's actually already yours instead of just feeling lack of it or trying to convince yourself of having it. In the end, it is a fact that affirming something with understanding, faith and conviction will be accepted by your subconscious mind much faster than affirming something which you don't even believe. As I understand it, the only reason robotic affirmation are working because you don't put any emotion behind it and you are completely detached from the outcome, which gives space for God to do it's thing. And remember, it's 99% you, only 1% is the method.

Another great way to do affirmations is to read or affirm some of your favourite quotes, perhaps from the Bible or some self improvement books. You see all the quotes I put here in this post. When I'm feeling down, I read my favorite Bible quotes or I go back to the books I read and read sentences I underlined. It really helps you bring your faith back and is actually building a new beliefs if you read it often enough. Affirmations don't need to be only in the form of ""I am"", you can affirm some quotes to bring your focus from negative things you're thinking about back to positive things.

Also, don't be scared of saying the wrong words. Try to change your self talk so you speak more positively in general but if you affirm something and then affirm the opposite of that don't think that suddenly your progress is lost or something stupid like that. It's okay, your mind won't accept some negative statement immediately after saying it, it takes some time and repetition for subconscious mind to accept something. While I'm at it, people today want everything to happen quickly, that's fine because when you desire something you want it right now I get it, but be happy that it takes some time to manifest, otherwise you'd get negative stuff quickly as well.

***VISUALIZATION:***

Same thing for visualization, if you believe it will work, it will work. What I want to say here is that people usually believe that if they don't see their imagined scenario vividly then it won't happen. Only a small percentage of people can visualize something clear like they are actually seeing it, most of the people can't do that so don't worry about it. In the same way, if you are in the middle of your scene and your focus drifts away to some other things that also doesn't mean that your progress is ruined. Just take your focus back on your scene and continue. Feeling is what matters.

**NOTE:** When you affirm or visualize I think the best emotion you can feel is gratitude. Think about something you have right now that you wanted so badly before, for example your phone, shoes, laptop, pc, car or something like that. When you first got that phone you so badly wanted you were probably so careful not to drop it, you put it down really slow, you took care of its battery by not charging it all the way to 100% and shit like that. Now, few months/years later you are throwing it on your bed, it falls down from your pocket but you are like ""whatever, it didn't break so it's fine"", you don't care about battery health anymore, phone case is all broken and ugly etc but you are grateful for that phone. But if someone was to ask you how do you feel about having your phone you would probably say that you don't feel anything really. Yeah you're grateful for that phone but you ""just have it"", it is sometimes you take for granted because it is normal. It is normal for you to have your phone, clothes, car etc and you are grateful for those things but let's be honest you are not to pumped about them. Same thing is for your desires, when you get them, you'll be happy and hyped but after very short time it will be just something that is normal in your life and you're going to live with that attitude. Human mind is like that, even if you desire 10 million dollars right now, if you were to get it, you'll maybe think ""it's actually not that much money"" and you'd probably want 50 million next. That is because our brains are goal seeking machines, your brain is constantly looking for some goals to achieve. So what I'm trying to say is when you affirm be grateful but when you visualize, visualize it like it's normal for you, like it's nothing special and it's your every day life. Do that and your mind will accept those pictures and scenes quicker because it's normal for you, it's already yours and it will actually make you feel the certain way because you are not forcing your emotions which is also a mistake a lot of people make. If you have to visualize it like you already have it, then it would be normal for you, emotions will come with it naturally. I spent a lot of time visualizing how I would feel the moment I get my desire, but don't do that. While it is not wrong to visualize that moment and it absolutely can't hurt trying, I think it's better to visualize already having that thing for some time, as I said, when it becomes normal part of your life. The reason for this is that it is a bit difficult to imagine how exactly you would feel if you get something you desired for a long time. In sports, when players or teams win the trophy, some people cry, some people laugh, some can't really believe it etc. It's maybe stupid to predict that feeling because it all depends on the moment to be honest. No one knows how exactly they will feel in those moments. I actually think it is one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my journey because I sometimes felt so frustrated for not being able to predict those feelings or decide what those emotions would be. It all depends on your desire really, how big it is and the type of that desire. I am not saying not to do that, I'm just saying that for you it's maybe better to visualize it as a normal every day thing in your life because that is easier for me.

Now I want to say why I think affirmations and visualization are two best methods (+ vision boards). It is because literally everyone uses them, consciously or unconsciously. Other methods are not used by everyone. Think about Kobe Bryant. Do you think he used water method? Of course he didn't, he had faith, he put in the work, he talked trash and was saying he is the best player in the world, which he believed and he probably always visualized hitting the game winning shots, winning the trophies, receiving the awards etc. Every professional sports player, entrepreneur or successful person used this methods since they were little kids. Not only them, everyone uses it, it's just that they use it in positive way for their own good while most of the people think and talk negatively about themselves and use their imagination to visualize scenarios that make them anxious and nervous. Am I saying that you should use only this 3 methods and not use others? No. Use whatever works best for you. I just want you to understand that it's not the methods that make things possible, it's your faith and attitude. You can get anything WITHOUT using any methods, it's just that it's human nature to think about the things we want and self talk and visualization are 2 easiest, quickest and most basic ways to do that and you probably do that automatically after thinking about your desire.

**3. MISTAKE - NOT BEING PRESENT AND TRYING TOO HARD**

I think this is also quite big mistake, although it is not as big as the first two. A lot of people have problems detaching from their desire and because of that they get too obsessed with it, especially when it comes to their sps. I was also a victim of this. When I was manifesting my sp, I was so obsessed with her at one point in time that probably two minutes couldn't pass without me thinking about her which definitely wasn't healthy and good for my mental health. I know a lot of you reading this are in the same position right now. So, I would constantly think about her, then I was worried about my future, I was thinking about how and when my desires will come to me, then I would think about my past, then I was repeating that cycle all day long so I spent least amount of my time living in the present moment. I recently started meditating, although I admit I should do it more often because it is not a regular practice in my life yet. Meditation enables you to stay in the moment and be present, so I would definitely recommend y'all to start meditating. Now, I don't know if it's because of meditation, or because my mindset really changed, I may say overnight, or maybe my mindset changed because of the meditation, I don't know what exactly is the reason, but in the last week or two I am much more relaxed and detached from my manifestations. I still desire them and God knows that, but I am absolutely fine if they don't happen, although I know they will. I don't know if I felt this calm about my desires since I started learning and practicing this 5 years ago. I think reasons for this are definitely reading my favourite Bible verses and honestly just being tired of trying to be perfect and trying to make every step of this journey perfectly. I kind of stopped caring and my faith increased suddenly because of that. I also feel like my desires are much closer to me now. I guess it is a sign that detachment really works. That being said, stop trying too fucking hard. Now you know that you are manifesting even when you are not aware of it, even when you don't know that manifesting is a real thing. So if you can do it effortlessly then, why would you be trying too hard now? Too many people look at this manifesting stuff like it is their second job or something like that. And I was like that too not long ago. That's one of the reasons why I don't like those methods too much. During a period of maybe 1 or 2 months I was doing this: I wake up and then as soon as I can I grab a piece of paper and pen that were right by my bed and I write some stupid affirmations about my sp 3 times and I read them. Then I come home from the college, tired as fuck, just wanting to chill or maybe take a nap, but no! Before that I ""need"" to write it again and read it 6 times. Same thing before going to sleep, as you may guess, writing and reading it for 9 times tired to the point when I can't even look, my eyes closing but I ""need"" to write and read it 9 times before I go to sleep because then it will work and I'll have my sp, just if I write them, if I don't then I'll never have them because I skipped it one time so not he progress is ruined, lol. It is actually so stupid and it felt like a job and something I absolutely have to do. I was putting all my trust in a method instead of putting my faith in myself and in God. I finally became tired of manifesting my sp because I didn't see any progress (I wonder why lol) and decided to let it all go. Let this be kind of warning to all people who are reading this and are currently manifesting sp, don't make the same mistake I did because you won't get your sp and you'll spend hours of time and so much energy into nothing. So yeah, don't try too hard, it is a paradox because people think that in order to get something you need to work hard for it. It is true to a certain degree but don't try it too hard you know. Put some faith in God and Universe also and let it do its thing and help you. You don't need to do it all by yourself. Manifestation and life itself actually, it is all a game, have fun with it. I know, it is a game that sometimes really tests us and our mental health lol but it's not all that serious. One of my favourite quotes is ""Don't take life to seriously, it's not like you are going to make it out alive"". We are all going to die one day and it might just be tomorrow, we don't know for sure. Yeah it's nice to remember some memories from the past and yes it is exciting to dream of our future, but spend some time in the present moment, it is all we have. Why spend all your life remembering and dreaming, live a little bit. You'll realise if you think about it for some time, that you feel most alive when you are fully present. When you are spending time with your friends, entirely occupied with present moment, you don't have time to worry or think of anxious thoughts, you are fully in the moment. When you are fully present you'll realise and when you can ""turn off"" your thoughts you'll realise that you are truly happy in those moments, and happiness is one of the highest vibrations you can be in, therefore being in that vibration will get you good things that will literally be attracted to you. Time is literally flying. I sometimes wonder where did all that time go lol. Stop for a few times a day, perhaps when you meditate and enjoy the present moment and be grateful for it. This is the youngest you'll ever be for the rest of your life. Be grateful and enjoy little moments in your life. And don't tell me that you don't have anything to be grateful for. You can be grateful that you read this post. You can be grateful about the fact that you have eyes and ears which enable you to learn about law of attraction and that can change your life. Just find the smallest thing and you'll soon find yourself noticing all other things which you feel grateful for.

Also, if you need, take a break from learning law of attraction. I recently watched one of the videos from Nero knowledge on youtube (check some of his videos if you want, he has some interesting things to say) and he said something that really clicked for me. He talked about analysis paralysis. That is basically reading the books or watching the videos all the time because you feel that you don't know enough, that you are missing that final piece of information that will connect all the dots and finally enable you to manifest anything you want. Also one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my journey. It is fine to read new books (I've read over 50, some of them up to 30+ times), it is fine to watch more videos. Everyone teaches this subject in their own way so you can hear new angles and details from them, but don't think that you are missing something. Almost anything you need is in this post, as I tried to really include everything. If it's not, it's in the few books that I always recommend (I'll write them in the end of the post). So yeah, take a break if you need. Too much information can be overwhelming. One week, two weeks, whatever it is, I guarantee you you'll feel fresh and rested in your mind.

I was told by someone that I shouldn't tip here. I keep wanting to tip. I went to a coffee house and we sat on the forth floor. The girl had to bring the coffee up all the stairs. Anyways here is the situation I had today.

  
I'm in Cat Ba and staying at a hotel. We checked in and a bell boy brought our luggage to our room. We finally caved and decided to tip. My girlfriend gave him some money. The kid gave us a weird look and took it. I thought his reaction was odd, and at first, thought it was because he is not supposed to take tips. I asked my girlfriend how much he gave him, and she said 10,000 dong. I was like no wonder he gave us a weird look. You tipped him 40 cents. I chased him down and gave him 5 dollars USD. He had another weird reaction. 

I went back to the room and started talking to my girlfriend. We figured out that we gave him 10,000 yen. That's around 66 dollars USD plus 5 dollars USD. We debated on whether we should say something. I was pushing for saying something.

  
On our way to dinner, we saw him at the front desk. We asked him if we have him 10k yen and he said yes. We explained the situation and asked for it back. He at first said no and then reluctantly gave it back when I said it was an honest mistake.

  
Anyways, what would you have done?

   * Founded in 1966, Cohiba was initially a private label reserved for Fidel Castro and Cuban dignitaries. The brand remained exclusive to the Cuban government until its public release in 1982, making it one of the youngest yet most prestigious Cuban cigar brands.
   * The brand’s name, “Cohiba,” is derived from the ancient Taino word for tobacco, symbolizing the deep connection to Cuba’s rich tobacco heritage.
* **Premium Tobacco Selection**:
   * Only the finest tobacco leaves are selected for Cohiba cigars, all sourced from the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba, an area globally renowned for producing the highest-quality tobacco. This region’s unique climate and soil provide the perfect growing conditions for the best tobacco plants.
   * Each leaf used in Cohiba cigars is carefully hand-picked to ensure top-tier quality, contributing to the brand’s legendary status.
* **Unique Fermentation Process**:
   * What truly sets Cohiba cigars apart is their special three-stage fermentation process. This additional step, exclusive to the brand, helps refine the tobacco, resulting in a smoother and more balanced smoking experience.
   * This unique fermentation adds a layer of depth to the flavor, enhancing the richness and creating a smoke that is both complex and harmonious.
* **Flavor Profile**:
   * Cohiba cigars are known for their complexity, offering an elegant blend of flavors that often include hints of cedar, earth, spice, leather, and subtle sweetness. This balance of flavors evolves as you smoke, offering a dynamic experience from start to finish.
   * Whether you prefer a medium-bodied cigar like the **Siglo Series** or the full-bodied richness of the **Maduro 5**, Cohiba delivers a variety of blends that cater to different palates while maintaining its signature smoothness.
* **Iconic Lines**:
   * **Cohiba Siglo Series**: A medium-bodied cigar with a creamy texture, offering notes of mild spices, wood, and a touch of sweetness. Perfect for those looking for a refined and balanced smoke.
   * **Cohiba Maduro 5**: A fuller-bodied cigar, rich with flavors of coffee, cocoa, and earthy undertones, making it a favorite among those who appreciate a bolder cigar.
   * **Cohiba Behike**: The crown jewel of the Cohiba portfolio, the Behike uses the rare **Medio Tiempo** leaves, which grow on only a small percentage of tobacco plants. This results in a cigar that is exceptionally rich and smooth, often described as the best cigar in the world.
* **Symbol of Prestige**:
   * With its signature black, white, and gold band, Cohiba cigars are immediately recognizable and symbolize the pinnacle of luxury and craftsmanship in the cigar world. Smoking a Cohiba is not just about the flavors—it’s about enjoying a piece of Cuban history and indulging in an experience that is reserved for those who appreciate the very best.
   * A Cohiba isn’t just a cigar; it’s a status symbol, recognized globally for its unparalleled quality.
* **For Collectors and Aficionados**:
   * The rarity and exclusivity of certain Cohiba lines, such as limited editions and regional releases, make them highly sought-after by collectors. Owning a box of Cohiba cigars is often seen as an investment, with many aficionados regarding it as the centerpiece of their cigar collection.
   * Special releases, including the **Cohiba 1966 Edición Limitada**, have become legendary, fetching high prices on the secondary market and adding to the brand’s mystique.
* **Cohiba’s Legacy in the World of Cigars**:
   * Few brands command the same respect and admiration as Cohiba in the cigar industry. Whether smoked to celebrate life’s grandest occasions or to mark personal milestones, Cohiba cigars are a timeless choice.
   * They offer something more than just flavor; they deliver a unique, immersive experience steeped in decades of Cuban tradition. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned smoker, Cohiba remains a symbol of excellence that transcends generations.",1,1729522515.0,KnowCigars,0,1.0,False

### Training
Prior to this year, I was literally just running for my health. I averaged *maybe* 20km/week? I saw it as more of a supplement to my lifting, to keep myself in not-terrible shape. As such, I've literally only been doing easy runs prior to this, which was at about a 6:45-7:00 pace. Anytime I got below 6:30, my heart rate would start creeping up. 

So, I signed up for the half marathon in late march, start increasing my running training, and promptly twisted my ankle pretty badly in late May, resulting in me taking two weeks off from training. I could barely walk, and it was only with the help of my amazing physio that I was back doing some light jogging two weeks later.

So, from there, I began again in June, ramped up my mileage from about 20km/week up to a peak of 55km/week. During which, my easy run paces went down from a 6:45 or so to around a 6:05-6:15, although, I can't tell how much of that is because the weather got cooler, and how much is actually an improvement in fitness. I could sustain faster paces, and even did a 25:05 5k, and a 53:52 10k during my speed work. I also managed to maintain about 90% of my squat/bench/deadlift strength, despite the huge (for me) ramp up in running volume. 

One thing that I found that built a lot of confidence in my running speed was progression runs. My coach (aka, my runner friend who does about 4 marathons a year) drew up a plan, which included progression runs once a week. I found that these built a lot of confidence in my ability to maintain speed, it was during these progression runs that I managed a 25:45 5k time and a 53:52 10k time. I actually managed to hit 20k twice during my running, albeit at slower paces, and they felt *hard*. The only time I managed any significant distance at my goal HM pace was 16km. So I definitely had some nerves going into Sunday. 

My lifting, I did a program called Simple Jack'd, by u/DadliftsnRuns, who I look up to both as a lifter and a runner. 

* Monday - Morning - easy run, Evening - Simple Jack'd Bench
* Tuesday - Tempo/Speed work
* Wednesday - Simple Jack'd deadlift
* Thursday - Easy run
* Friday - Simple Jack'd Bench
* Saturday - Long Run
* Sunday - Simple Jack'd Squat

### Pre-race
Tried to keep the schedule everything about the same. I had one easy run on the Friday, was a couch potato on the Saturday, ate like normal. Except I had some melatonin around 7pm, which helped me fall asleep by 8pm. Which allowed me to wake up at 5am nice and refreshed. Had coffee, oatmeal, banana, and tried to poop. Unfortunately, it was a little bit too early. Which bit me later on. Showered, changed, and had my sweats on until like 20 minutes before the race began. Then we took public transit down to the event. Got there with about an hour to spare... most of which actually got eaten up by the fact that I needed to poop, and the lines for the washrooms were huge. Thankfully, they delayed the start, so I managed to poop, change, and warmup. My fiancée was there to cheer me on, and she was able to hold my bags for me. I'm so grateful fo all her help. 

### Race
Despite the late start, I didn't manage to get into the right corral. Hence, my first two kilometers being a lot below my goal pace. I eventually caught up to the 2:00 pacers, and just kept up with them. I gotta say, this race had me super hyped. I was actually a little bit scared because my heart rate after the first kilometer was actually about 20bpm higher than it had been in training for that given pace, but my legs felt great, breathing felt easy, and so I just assumed it was the hype of the race and cheering, and that it would settle lol. It never settled. I was hyped the entire race, my legs felt great, my lungs felt great, even if my heart was racing. 

First 3km was on an incline. Followed by a 3km decline, and from there, we were running along the waterfront. Running through the city was great because of all the cheering. Running along the waterfront was great because the view was gorgeous. The sun had just risen, and it looked fantastic. I will say though, learning to drink from a cup mid-run was a pain. I kinda wish I brought my water bottle instead, but oh well. Had one gel that they handed to me around the 1km mark, but I don't even think I needed it. The electrolyte water, the cheers, and the other runners kept me amped up. 

This was definitely new territory for me. By the time I got to about 12km or so in, I still felt fantastic, so I started pushing the pace a little bit. I actually got ahead of the 2:00 pacer, and next thing you know, I couldn't even spot them behind me in the crowd. So I just ran from group to group. I think around 18km in, my feet and legs were feeling a bit sore. And in the final stretch, all I could say is that it felt a lot longer than it probably was. So I just dug deep and kept running. And apparently managed 4:33 on my KM21, which absolutely blew me away. Even in training, 4:30s is something which I only hit during my interval work. 

Which tells me maybe I could have paced it a little bit better, and started a little bit faster. My garmin predicted that I could do a 1:49 finish. I think I could have probably done 1:55 if I had paced a little bit better. 

I finished smack dab in the middle of the pack for my age group (606/1244), and in the top third overall (2972/11636). Not too shabby for my first ever race. 

### Post-race
So, as my first ever race, it was fantastic, and I loved both the hype and all the energy. So I immediately signed up for the a full marathon in May. 

I'll probably spend the next 2-3 months focusing on lifting while cutting down the running to about 40km/week of easy running, before ramping things back up for the full. 

Also, man, I'm sore right now.

Using tap water or bottled ""mineral"" waters were never as good as water I made myself. I use Lotus drops and have settled on a recipe that is almost exactly the ""Bright & Juicy"" recipe on their site. I've done lots of blind side by side testing, which is obviously an n=1 and my preferences do tend towards the ""under-extracted"" acidic side of things, even for modern pour over preferences, so keep that as a caveat.



I have a friend who has been telling me that reverse osmosis water is as good as any other water he's used and I've been calling BS for the last few months, but I finally tried some side by side testing and was  surprised. On two very good coffees that I had well dialed in, the Vinka Sidra and Finca La Roca Gesha from Prodigal, I noticed minimal difference between my water recipe and RO water. Maybe slightly slightly more clarity and a crisper mouthfeel with the re-mineralized water, but I had trouble differentiating them in the testing and the difference was minimal enough for me to wonder if the extra steps and cost of making my own water are worth it.

  
Some thoughts...I prefer much lower extraction than most (though based on recent musings from Lance and Dr. Smrke, maybe this is where general preferences are headed), so maybe I don't need the help of minerals in the water to increase extraction. But from what I've seen, there's controversy on whether the long held belief that certain ions help with extraction is actually true, so who knows. Maybe these coffees are already so good and fit my taste so perfectly that the difference would be minimal no matter what water I use. And of course, this was with only two coffees and one person, so very un-scientific. Bottom line is I'm wondering if anybody else has similar experiences or any thoughts, super interested to hear!",1,1729522343.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

Problem 1- People moved in in May-ish and leave their dogs out on the balcony all day, all night. They bark all day, all night, and this is what the entire neighborhood has been listening to for 6 months. Multiple people in the community have had personal conversations with the tenants, we have called animal control multiple times, and we have contacted the Bluesky Landing leasing office. I went to bed to the sound of barking dogs, again, and had my coffee listening to it this morning.

Problem 2- Over the last two months someone's car alarm has gone off \*literally every single morning\* between 5:50a-6a. I get that car repairs are expensive and this seems to be some messed up wiring, I guess, but I don't know how a person navigates the world thinking nothing of waking up the entire neighborhood every single day? Maybe they think it's quiet? I'm not creepy enough to go hang out in the parking lot in the morning to try to let this person know their car wakes up everyone every single day but... what else could I do to ask this nonsense to stop?

I am really at a loss for how to reclaim some semblance of peace and quiet in the neighborhood, and I know all of my neighbors are upset about this too. Any other ideas? I feel like a Karen but I am LOSING MY MIND.",3,1729522219.0,LakewoodColorado,0,1.0,False

1g8recv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1g8recv/online_dating_advice_from_an_audhder/,Online Dating Advice from an AuDHDer!,"I wrote this as a reply to someone’s post about online dating as an AuDHDer looking for a long term relationship and thought it would make a good post on its own.

Here’s some things I’ve learned about online dating that help me find people with potential to be a partner:

1. Be picky about who you swipe right on. If you’re looking for a long term relationship, only swipe right on others who have that marked in their bio. Idc how cute they are, if you’re looking for short term or “figuring out your dating goals”, we’re not looking for the same thing. You can be picky with other stuff here as well (I won’t swipe right on anyone who doesn’t have liberal marked for their political views).

2. Meet up as soon as possible. I find texting exhausting because it’s going to be all small talk in the beginning. I don’t do “talking phases” I’m a grown ass woman. We’re either dating or we’re not. This also helps to get rid of the people who aren’t actually serious about meeting someone, and it moves the process along way quicker. No one wants to spend weeks texting someone then you finally meet up in person, and you realize you don’t vibe with them. I straight up just say, “hey I’m not big on doing a bunch of texting to get to know someone. I’d much rather meet up. Would you like to grab some coffee?” and if they don’t like it, we’re probably not compatible anyways.

3. Be straight forward with what you’re looking for and what’s important to you in a partnership on the first date. I make it very clear that I am only interested in dating with the goal being we end up in a long term relationship and what that means to me. If they’re not also looking for that or we don’t share similar views about what that means to us, then no second date. I also ask about what life goals they have, what their values are, how they take care of themselves (physically, mentally, emotionally), and what their lifestyle is like. These are key things to discuss to figure out compatibility and find any red flags/dealbreakers. Again, if they don’t like it, they’re not for me.

4. When it comes to masking, I only do a “half-mask”, where I’m a little more bubbly and aware of social queues, but I also let some of my ND traits show (looking away when talking and making eye contact when listening, interrupting, forgetting what I was gonna say, being blunt and direct, speaking about my SPINS and hyperfixations). Everyone is a little fake on first dates anyways, but this allows me to show more of myself and makes it easier to unmask more if we continue seeing each other. Again, if they don’t vibe with it, they’re not for me.

5. Go at your own pace and communicate boundaries early. Dating is exhausting in the early stages, so I limit how often I see them (and text them) and how long we hang out with it slowly increasing as I get more comfortable with them and unmask more. Again, I straight up tell them I’m pretty introverted and these early stages are very draining on me. If you’re compatible, they’ll understand and respect this. 

6. For intimacy, again, communicate your boundaries with this. Demisexuality is very common in neurodivergence, so we might need more time to feel that desire. If they initiate something you don’t want to do (even if it’s something you might want to eventually), let them know you need more time. Again, someone who is compatible with you will understand this, and anyone who pushes your boundaries is waving a giant red flag in your face. Ditch them. 

7. Lastly, remember to take breaks with dating. Sometimes it doesn’t work out, or sometimes you find yourself going on a million first dates. It’s exhausting! Take time between to rest and recharge before immediately getting back on the apps. Dating is suppose to be fun and exciting! If it starts feeling like a drag, it’s time for a break.

I hope these tips help! The current guy I’m dating is also autistic, and he says he loves how blunt and direct I am. He doesn’t feel like he needs to try to read my mind, and I have my boundaries understood and respected. We can do it ya’ll!",1,1729521921.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

I've tried gels/blocks/beans (gross! and gives me tummy aches!), eating 3-4 hrs before running (will have awful cramps), eating before running (just no), and no luck, just terrible runs (no pun intended).

TLDR: My question is this... Is it possible to train my body to run long distances with food/nutrition even though it has always given me terrible trouble? Or do I just train without fuel (besides electrolyte water) and get comfortable with that?

Bond to the max, unfortunately we fell out around age 19-20 due to her BF, her hardcore Christian views, & plain arguing. At the time, after sharing a room my entire life, I was finally happy she moved out even if we did not talk. Was able to breathe, think on my own & came into myself. Whenever she would come, are talks became more sparse. BF was mentioned more, & he was a toxic dude. She wanted someone to gossip too, but endure the situation with her which I flat out rejected. I IGNORED THIS RED FLAG. She would go talk to my little sister, who ended up telling her to leave him, then those talks would end. Overall, understood, she is going to do what she wants & lie if she needs to. One day she reassured me she would not get pregnant, (I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD & DID NOT REGISTER THAT AS A POSSIBILITY). Fast forward to May ( we are not talking FOR ALMOST A YR) & I start to feel guilty, & two days in a row I leave her a coffee. She invites me to lunch that week & discloses she is 6 months pregnant. I bawl like a baby, & tell her the family is here. I went thru the overnight transition of not speaking to her for so long, to having the desire to spend all time we had left. Something was registering to me, that  she was NOT ready for a kid. I read her journal bc she leaves it EVERYWHERE(MY BAD) & read concerning statements like, ""They'll be disgusted when they find out his real age', 'when I found out I was pregnant, I was relieved he'd be in my life forever"", & she claimed she loved him more than God. Overall, she has voiced BOTH she can't stand him, he's stupid, she doesn't see a future, he's misogynistic, etc. but will go ahead & do what she wants. Friday she goes into labor, we hear she doesn't go to hospital bc BF  is tense & 'weird' (her words)Today I saw my nephew for the first time, it was a calming experience & I trust he'll be fine. I would want better for my sister, therefore him & sometimes it feels like she consciously doesn't try to self sabatogaes. I was told he was 24 yo, I heard that age from my little sister & my twin confirmed same thing. After spending the night with my sister, we stood up till 4 am , talking about family drama & planning stuff. She complained about how the BF waited 2 hours after contractions, cuz he didn't wanna get in traffic, held her down in delivery, did not listen, played dumb, etc. I told explicitly I need to know any details I can since baby is born that will help - because she told me she was pregnant 7 months after, & I felt uneasy about her managing a relationship w my mom, her BF and the family and her kid. She is dependant/ attached to each one of them & we are all disagreeing. SHE DECIDED TO STILL NOT DISCLOSE HIS AGE. The boyfriend came in around noon & was the first time I just had to sit & just observe their real life interactions. Mind you, BEING HER TWIN, I could not control the visceral response my body had. Just sitting there, listening to his boring, boring, self. He had such empty talk, (understand he is probably exhausted)but I couldn't believe this was the guy it was all for, & I felt uncomfortable just seeing the reality of him. I blame my sister for just expecting people can tolerate their loved one and someone like that interacting in front of them, (SHE WONT TELL ME DIRECTION OF RELATIONSHIP -BC SHE WANTS BABY TO BE OK FIRST -WE ALL FEEL UNEASY) I never understood what she saw in the guy, could not ask her, but she would disclose how immature & disrespectful he was. I said, can I ask ""when's ur bday?"" He said' Dec 24th,' I said, ""turning?""

and he responded, ""..32."" I nodded & mumbled thats what I thought. 2 mins later, I said, ""I didn't know that.'

and he chuckled, ""no?"" I said it's not funny, My twin finally chimed in & said ""not for her."" My twin started ti freak out, cuz she could feel how angry he was, & looking back knows how immature dude is, so it's a cluctserfuck.

I emotionally reacted, ""I didn't even think you were 25, you seem immature. I'm just saying, both of ur guys issues is so observable.""

My sister said thats my opinion, then BF  started grouping himself  with ""we feel"" comments, we  both began bickering, but she was crying. He started to coddle her &  said, ""it's not about me, about baby health, etc"". Which, to me is diverting. The fact that he can't understand why a sister would react that way, after real time being lied to. He chuckled to my twin, ""I don't care you told them I am 25."" I said, ""you won't give her a standard.""  then my sister CRIED again, she does this to trigger him cuz he starts babying her. THIS IS A POSSIBLITY WHEN U LIE TO THIS EXTENT, I just repeated ""consequences of your actions.""

She said, ""I'm glad you got your feelings out."" I said, ""I'm glad you lied, I agree it\\s about the baby's health, tho""

She cried for a little more, BUT THE WHOLE INTERACTION WAS ABOUT 5 MINS TOTAL, SHORT IN SHORT I CONFRONTED HIM, HE DIVERTED, WE WERE ALL EMOTIOANLLY HEIGHTENED AFTER THE AGE AT DIFF LEVELS, BUT THEY DONT CARE TO ADRESS IT ( I MEAN I JUST TOLD MY LITTLE SISTER THE REAL AGE, HOW LONG WAS IT GOING TO BE?)

Hi guys, it's not my first time here but I guess something kinda clicked and I am finally measuring the ""emergency"" of my situation.

I am a 25F.
I am 178 cm tall (5ft8) and I am currently weighting 186.4 lbs (84.5 kg).

According to my BMI (28.3) and my body fat pourcentage (31%) i am considered overweight. I also FEEL overweight : simple exercising is much harder, lots of friction everywhere on my body, I feel out of shape etc...

The thing is, everything was very different 2 years ago.
I was weighting around 150 lbs (68 kg), never felt insecure about my body and people used to compare me to models because of my height...

I gained all this weight very fast and we are still unsure about the reasons of why the weight gain was so sudden.

Some causes :
- I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder 3 years ago, two years ago I had a Venlafaxine treatment but switched 6 months ago to Prozac.
- I was diagnosed with bulimia (without purging) a year ago, but this pattern of binge eating has been there since my teenage years and it used to have no impact on my body.
- I am now 25 years old, I guess at a certain age some things change...


I tried many times to loose weight, I have weekly appointments with a nutritionist and a therapist. But I keep getting bigger, alternating between healthy eating and huge binging session and walking 10k steps a day to spending all day in my bed.

However last week something kinda clicked... We spent 3 days in NY with some friends and walked A LOT. And I was feeling so out of breath, but also so uncomfortable in my own skin...
Since I gained a lot of weight I don't fit in a lot of my clothes anymore so i am not comfortable with my current style...

So I decided to finally be consistent, because it looks like it's the lack of consistency that makes me take steps backwards.

I wanted to ask to you guys if this looks like a good diet+ exercising plan :

- 1500 kcal/day (2000 is my weight maintain)
- 10k steps a day OR a light workout (everyday)
- 1.5 L of water/day
- no sodas
- 2 coffees max/day
- 8 hours of sleep min
- self-massage for blood circulation

For the light workouts I was thinking of 30 min of dancing or 30 min of standing workouts video (like pilates)


Do you guys think I could loose weight following this plan?

Are the health benefits related to drinking coffee related to its caffieen content ? Or is it the antioxidents and what we assume to be some good combination of healthy molecules .

If my problem could be related to caffien (drinking coffee , or preworkout) maybe consuming decafewould give me the best of two worlds the benefit without the presumed unknown harms of caffien .

My partner tends to criticize the littlest things I tend to do, from how I speak to strangers to how I like to be nosey when I see police activity. 

Yesterday we were driving home from visiting old friends. I was driving, he was in the passenger seat. 

I noticed a storm of police cars behind me and pull over to let them pass. I made a comment that it was intense and something is going on. As I am driving down the highway I noticed every exit being blocked off by police, then looking onto the opposite lane highway, it was completely bare for miles and I pointed that out, something was happening. 

I kept driving along, I can feel my partner staring at me, watching and waiting for me to look at any police activity passing by. 

I made a comment again, wow something is happening, maybe check your phone and see if anything is on the news, every exit is blocked off, and then we see the opposite side being blocked completely and the traffic was at a complete stop with police getting out of the cars and going to each car for some reason. 

I look over to my partner and he is staring at me still and then goes on a rant “you are rubber necking, you are being nosey, you are rubber necking” on repeat. And I’m like how can you deny something crazy is happening all around us? And he keeps repeating that I’m rubber necking. 

So I lashed back and said “who cares if I am??!! Who cares if I am a little nosey and want to know what’s happening?!” And he keeps interrupting me “you are rubber necking” like antagonizing me. 

I keep coming back to him like “idgaf! This is who I am! Let me be!” 

I’m not slowing down traffic, I’m not stopping, I’m just driving down and observing all that is happening around us and really want to know what’s up! 

He keeps going at it with me. 

So I flip out. His father tends to criticize every move their mother makes, from how she spreads the butter on the bread to how she serves her husband a plate of dinner but forgot the knife, etc etc. it’s really hard to watch when I am there, she’s like his slave. So I freak out on him and call him by his father’s name, and told him I am not going to be subjected to this controlling behavior. 

He laughs and he seems to be getting a kick out of me being upset. Says again again rubbernecker. 

So I tell him how it makes me feel, I said while I was driving I felt him staring at me waiting for me to say something about the police activity. He won’t even look at all the police activity (literally it was insane and surrounding us, including helicopters too and drones but he doesn’t notice because he chooses not to look at that but to stare at me and wait for me to look at our surroundings). So I gently touched his face and directed it towards me and said how would you like it if you are stared out this closely being criticized. Again, I was not rough, he has a beard and I was touching his beard and turned his head my direction (we were in traffic, at a stop), and he FLIPS out for touching him as if I was abusing him. And literally said you laid your hands on me. And I’m shocked because I wasn’t rough at all, it was the slightest guide of my hand moving him into my face. 

And now he won’t speak to me. 

Sure I probably shouldn’t touch him, but the intent wasn’t to hurt or hit or anything like that. It was “how do you think I feel with you staring down my face like this” while he was ranting and calling me names and I was doing this to get his attention. 

 He won’t talk to me now. 

He didn’t take out the trash this morning or make us coffee. 

So I don’t know what to do now. 

He is : 40/m  I am 40/f 

Together for 25 years. 

I can’t stand when he acts just like his father, it scares me that I’m putting myself at risk like his mom. ",0,1729521788.0,relationship_advice,17,0.33,False

I (24M) and my girlfriend (22F), in an 8 month relationship, are now experiencing a very steep downhill path in our relationship.

For Context:
This is my first ever relationship, been involved in a lot of situationships before though. To start, we started as friends who fell for each other in the course of the friendship. I courted her for 4-5 months roughly. And she said yes during valentines. It was going well for 2 months and during our 3rd month we fought for the first time, big time fight. Pero yon nagkaayos kami, pero nagstart ung mga pagaaway namin tungkol sa maliliit na bagay, since first relationship ko nga to, tungkol sa hindi ko siya nasstory pag nagsesend siya ng pic, one time nakalimutan bumati agad during monthsary (school day kasi and medyo busy: college things), etc.
 
Then yon came 4th monthsary namin, galing pa kami ng away non kaya medyo wala pa kami sa mood pareho but we decided going on a date (which honestly I think we shouldn't have), and things went oh so wrong, it started nung nagkita kami tapos buong time na papunta kami sa place di niya ako pinapansin, di niya ako kinakausap and nauuna siya sakin maglakad so medyo nainis ako sa ginawa na yon. Tapos nung nasa coffee shop na kami, she was so into using her phone more than interacting with me so lalo akong nainis so I left her (not very good and gentlemanly of me to do I know, nandilim lang talaga paningin ko). Then yon paguwi nagkagalit nanaman kami lalo sa messenger saying bad stuff to each other leading to a cool off for almost 3 months. We didn't go no contact though kasi nga we still wanted it to work, so ung set up is BFF shiz? still close but not intimate? IDK nakakag*gong setup IK. then ayon ""nagkabalikan"" then I started seeing the oh so many red flags but still I chose to stay. Then ayon narealize ko na sheesh sobrang baba ng tingin sakin, I was not allowed magtampo, mainis, magalit, while all the while siya laging nagagalit even from minor things. One instance pa we were playing codm non, akala ko naririnig ako magsalita, wtf nagalit na hindi daw ako agad sumakay kasi wala daw siya loot, ending 5 araw na akong di nirerespeto bilang tao HAHAHAHAHA (and YES eto po ung current na away namin, natatawa na nga ako eh HAHAHAHA).

1g8r5sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g8r5sv/first_date_11_gifts_love_bombing/,First date: 11 Gifts = Love bombing? ,"I went on a first date last night. For some background: I’ve been avoiding meeting this guy I matched with on Hinge for about a year and 5 months - simply because I was in a very abusive relationship before and I wasn’t quite ready to date in-person. I did share this with him and while he understood, he also tried a few times to meet and I always turned him down. Until last night. A few red flags but I’m wondering if they’re truly red flags - so I need advice.

We were supposed to meet on Friday and I rescheduled for Saturday. Once Saturday came, we couldn’t decide on a location because we’re about an hour from each other. I tried to cancel but turned out he had already decided to drive into my town. So he said he was around and available and just wanted to meet, even if it was for 30 minutes. I see this as a potential red flag because he drove into town so I couldn’t or wouldn’t cancel/reschedule. He admitted this to me because he said he had a feeling I would (from previous attempts with me). Is this a red flag?

Second potential red flag is he gave me a good amount of gifts. He got me a bouquet of roses, a bag of chocolates and since he’s from Serbia, he stopped at a local Serbian store and grabbed a bunch of delicacies from his country to gift to me. It was chocolate spread, tomato spread, coffee, a coffee cup, pickles, four different chocolates and the roses. He admitted driving into town before I could agree so he had time to grab the gifts. I could see how this is may be love bombing? I need to see it from someone else’s perspective.

As a thank you, I decided to give him a tap kiss. Before parting ways at the end, we kissed, more intensely and he grabbed the back of my head, fingers through my hair and he kind of made a fist with my hair. He also grabbed my neck while kissing. While I enjoyed it (especially after three glasses of red wine) in the moment I also asked myself if this was maybe too much? Am I reading into things too much bc of previous trauma in past abusive relationships?

- highest possible ram and processor (thinking 16gb and an i5 or Ryzen equivalent)
- no more than 512gb storage (256gb if it means upgraded specs in other areas)
- Good built in webcam (1080p minimum)
- No frills or gimmicks if it mean downgrading core internals (don't care about 2in1 touch screen, fingerprint etc)

Back then, it wasn’t just a game—it was... well, nothing, because it literally didn’t exist yet. But somehow, that’s what made it so exciting. The world was wide open, and I could imagine navigating Victorian spaceships through the vast vacuum of steam-powered bureaucracy. My backyard was basically the Wild West of interstellar travel—except, you know, minus the lasers and space pirates. It was more like avoiding cholera and hoping your horse didn’t die on the Oregon Trail. Same vibe, though.

I miss how easy it was to score a good trade back then. Forget ISK—trading two potatoes for a rusty pocket watch felt like winning the lottery. These days, you can’t even get a decent cup of coffee for under five bucks, and don't get me started on inflation—this was back when a loaf of bread cost 5 cents, and gold rushes weren’t just EVE updates; they were real, sweaty men digging holes in the ground with pickaxes!

And the PvP? Oh, the PvP was brutal in 1897. Ever try to outpace your neighbor in the weekly ""who can dig the biggest hole in the yard"" competition? That’s what real competition felt like. Or trying to steal someone’s horse without getting caught. It was a cutthroat environment, much like modern-day Jita, except instead of market scams, you were scammed into buying “patent medicines” that were basically just alcohol and snake oil.

Honestly, I miss the excitement of random encounters. One day you’re milking the cow, the next you’re dodging the draft for the Spanish-American War. It was unpredictable, just like the old EVE days when you could undock your ship and BAM! You were caught in a territorial dispute over who owns a star system (or in this case, who’s entitled to the last stick of butter).

Now? Now it’s all gentrified. The Industrial Revolution came in and suddenly we have assembly lines, trains, and telephones. Back then, the only ""industry"" was you trying to figure out how to grow enough potatoes to survive the winter. Those were the real challenges. The ""early game"" grind was insane, but the sense of accomplishment when you didn't die of tuberculosis? Priceless.

I blame Edison for all of this, honestly. Sure, light bulbs are cool, but where’s the mystery? Where’s the adventure? Once you can illuminate the whole room, there’s no excitement left in walking around in the dark, hoping you don’t trip over a chamber pot.

TL;DR: I miss EVE Online from 1897 when the game didn’t exist, and life was all about potato-based economies, avoiding cholera, and competing for yard supremacy. Modern life is just too predictable with its light bulbs and steam engines.",12,1729520861.0,Eve,4,0.77,False

Brief context, I applied for Chancenkarte, and it got approved in August. So I quit my job in my country and hopped on a plane 2 weeks ago, lol.

I am currently staying at a friends place, and probably will live here for a while. I have some general technical questions about banks and stff, but the main reason I'm posting this is my friend is gonna be away for 1-2 weeks, and I have no idea what to do in the city in general! I stay near Sanssouci Park, and I realize Berlin would offer more for socializing but expatrio has still not opened up a blocked account for me, so I cannot get the 50-eur ticket, and I don't wanna get an ABC ticket everytime I go to Berlin, so I'm holding that off for a bit, until my bank stuff is all taken care of.

Can you guys recommend me some cafes, clubs, restaurants etc, that I can go by myself? I like going to a cafe and ordering a coffee, reading/writing/being on my laptop whilst drinking it. Would that be seen weird in certain cafes? Or for concerts, what would you suggest? I listen to pretty much anything.

I tried some dating apps to find people/make friends, but those apps always feel like a hellhole.

Idk, currently feel very awkward on what to do outside, hopefully not a stupid question.



Also, my other questions (if anyone'd want to answer) are as follows:

* Has anyone used expatrio, and what document did you upload for the final step of verification? The only 4 options it gives me are; ""Anmeldung"", ""lease contract"", ""a bill to my name"" or a ""letter from an insurance company"". Since I'm staying at a friends place, I do not have 3/4 of these things. I uploaded my insurance contract (which I signed with expatrio's own insurance service anyway!) but it's still waiting for validation for 2 days, and I'm kinda afraid it's gonna be rejected.

* I realize an Anmeldung is necessary, but I believe I cannot get it while staying w/ my friend. Are there any workarounds for this? Everything seems to require an Anmeldung, but I will be searching for jobs all over Germany for the following months, so I dont know if I can lease a place right now, since I might be required to move if I find a job..

I guess thats it, thanks in advance,

As a foreigner I'm interested in learning about how things work here in Albania business wise - not necessarily planning to open a business or anything, just purely hypothetical.

I obviously know Tirana is bombarded with cafés but to be more precise, I'm a remote worker and I think I identified a need for more ""modern"" cafés or Specialty Coffee places such as Antigua Specialty Coffee or Hana Corner Cafe which I absolutely love. So feel free to ""steal"" my idea and open up more places like that here lol.

Just in case I'd actually decide to pursue this idea in the future I'd love to know - how hard are things here with bureaucracy? How fast can you get something done and open up a coffee shop? Is it possible to estimate how much of an initial investment would it cost to start a small café like Hana for example?  
I'd probably imagine a foreigner couldn't start a business in Tirana if they don't speak Albanian or don't have a local business partner, would you say that's generally true?

I haven't drunk caffeine regularly before. And I didn't drink any type of caffeine after I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at 17. 
But recently, I started drinking energy drinks half a year ago because I realized how helpful of a tool caffeine can be in your arsenal. 

 I drink energy drinks almost every Monday and Thursday because those days are very long and tightly scheduled for me, and I need the extra energy. I don't like coffee that much, so I drink energy drinks. I regularly watch my blood pressure and heart rate, and I don't see any spikes or changes. And I feel good. 

So I wonder if energy drinks are really that bad for you. Because here the countries in the European Union banned a lot of chemicals, synthetic ingredients, and such. Therefore, almost all the bad stuff is removed, that is, in the energy drinks in the USA or the UK, for example. So if I drink 2, 250ml cans of zero-sugar energy drinks that have 160mg of caffeine in them regularly, is it gonna cause any harm to me in the long term?

You know those posts where people have friends  or mutual who  behave like a flying monkey to harass their friend who is clearly not in the wrong on behalf of a friend who clearly is??   Well I’ve found some of them! 

I found it hard to believe these kind of people actually exist but they do and I know lots of them apparently! 

We have a friend (m38) Jacob who has been in a 5 year relationship with Jenny (f36). They live together in his house for the last two years. Well Jenny who wfh got told she had to head up a project 5 hours away so was doing every second week away from home. This went for nearly 4 months until Jacob discovered there was no project and she was leaving to go live in his best friend’s house every second week. This guy (m38) Jason has been his best friend since they were babies. Like brothers! So Jacob threw her out and blocked them both. Appropriate response I felt! 

Well Jenny has been gathering the minions to harass Jacob in order to let her move back in. Jason finally found a conscience and dumped her so she has no where to go. She is struggling to find an apartment that will take her two very large dogs! They are boisterous and Jacob spent hours just walking them and looking after them. She insisted on taking them but then Jason told her she couldn’t stay. Her family don’t live close by either. 

Well I got the call that we needed to get Jenny back in Jacob’s house for her and the dogs sake as she is running out of money in an air bnb and she is afraid the owners will find out she has dogs! They wanted me to harass poor Jacob by text Into  pressuring him to let Jenny back and to forgive her. 

Well I recently broke up with my bf and when I was getting his sob  story filtered back through mutuals ( because I wouldn’t talk to him) I immediately told everyone that I didn’t want to hear about ex and anyone who did would be blocked. So I’m not here for harassing Jacob. 

So I sent out a group message saying any of them could take in Jenny and her dogs or she could give the dogs to Jacob as he was the one who looked after them anyway and anyone who asked me to harass Jacob was getting blocked! 

 I really can’t believe the audacity of these people getting involved to this point! 

Anyway I started to get some nasty messages calling me heartless and cruel so I just went on a mass blocking spree! 

My best friend agrees that they are all out of line but thinks me  going scorched earth was too far and a bit of an overreaction. 

Now as I’m still fairly raw from my own break up I’m wondering if I did go too far. Jacob has contacted me to thank me ( I put him in the group chat) and he says it’s been very disheartening. He says he has his ex friend desperately trying to make amends but he’s not interested and he has Jenny harassing him for room and board and to “make it work” and he feels like he is going to implode anyway but then the campaign of texts and messages  from friends and mutuals has nearly driven him over the edge. I get it. Especially after such a huge betrayal anyway then to have his supposed support system side with the cheater must be devastating for him. Anyway we are meeting for coffee and will keep in touch more. But seriously I can’t be wrong here can I ?? 


Edit sorry about all the J names. 🤣 Jacob and Jason real names do both start with the same letter but his exes doesn’t and I kept typing her real name by accident so came up with Jenny ( who is my cat ) 😂 ",2,1729520418.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

My grandma is very charming and sweet, I don't disagree with that, but it's clear when she's being manipulative about it. 
When I was in high school I was a vegetarian, so after the graduation ceremony I was asked where I wanted to go and I just wanted Olive Garden or somewhere Italian. My grandma wanted to go to a specific steakhouse, I said ""But I'm a vegetarian and the only non-meat item on their menu is a small French onion soup,"" she looked at me with astonishment and said ""But honey, that's your grandma's favorite restaurant! Don't you want grandma to be happy?"" She convinced everyone else in the car, so we ended up going to the steakhouse, I left the restaurant hungry because the soup was too small. 
At my wedding earlier this year, she wanted to gift me baby clothes in front of the entire reception during speeches. I wasn't pregnant on my wedding day, but my husband and I had planned on trying for a baby as soon as we were married, and we let our family know our plans. I told her ""Grandma if you give me baby clothes in front of everyone, they're going to think I'm pregnant at my wedding, and I plan on drinking at my wedding it's going to be a bad look,"" she said ""But sweetie, grandma flew all the way over here and I want everyone to know I was the first to gift you baby clothes!"" I told her no, she kept saying that she was going to do it at the reception and when I reminded her that she better not she'd just say ""oh well I'm just an old lady I forget things."" Luckily she ended up not doing it.
On my wedding day, my grandma flew in from pretty far away with my cousin who was keeping an eye on her. I told my grandma and everyone else that my cousin and my brother would be the ones to attend to her if she needed anything since I'd be so busy the morning of my wedding; despite this she still kept coming to me to get her a glass of water, coffee, etc even after I told her repeatedly ""cousin or brother can get you that."" She even asked me to run down to the pharmacy to pick up aspirin for her while I was getting my makeup done; my brother and cousin are not incompetent by the way, they were with us in the room and got her everything she needed.
Now I am actually pregnant, and my grandma wants to fly across the ocean 12 hours for the baby shower. At first I was very flattered and I said ""Grandma that's so sweet of you but I'd prefer if you waited a few months for when the baby is born; it's an expensive trip so I'd like it if you saved your money to actually meet him, and especially because I wouldn't be able to help you out as much right now because I'm massively pregnant."" By the way, my grandma is not a wealthy woman at all; she worked as a waitress her entire life. She also doesn't use a smart phone, so we'd need someone to pick her up from the airport and escort her everywhere like what my cousin did for the wedding, which I'd be happy to sort out for her in a few months time but not right now. She insisted that she wouldn't need that; she said the same thing about my wedding and it didn't play out that way at all.  I just know that as soon as she lands she will drop the ""I'm independent act"" and play the ""little old lady who doesn't know anything"" card like she did for the wedding and demand attention for any little thing just like the wedding. She said ""I have 5 pairs of baby outfits I want to give you in person,"" I said ""grandma you already gave me baby clothes in person the day after wedding."" I also told her that I'd be worried about her being late for the party; she wants to fly in the morning of (again a 12 hour international flight), go straight to the party, then fly back home. I said ""you flew in the morning of my wedding and you were almost late in walking me down the aisle,"" (btw she wasn't late because of the flight, she got to the hotel 7 hours before the ceremony. She almost missed walking me down because she spent extra time on her hair and missed all of our frantic calls, my maid if honor had to hunt her down). She said ""well a baby shower is different I'll definitely make sure not to be late for that."" I told her that was a really upsetting thing to say and she just said ""oh I'm an old lady I don't know what I'm saying anymore.""",1,1729520377.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I was detached that time, I am an INTJ. We have the same trait, same humor, and relevant experiences about childhood. We also go along with choices and plans, the different is that I create a foundation and I am the one who feels, while she's avoidant.

We had misunderstandings before, yet we are able to provide solution for those circumstances that we had faced. I always open up to her, she then acknowledge her mistakes, we learned from each other. I honestly could not believe that she'll love me— 'cause in the first place, loving someone has never been in her plans. I was her first girlfriend too.

Until some matters changed. She became impatient and irritable with things, to the point that she'd offended and disrespected me. At first, it was a talk, it was light. After a few months, she became cold. I was used to her cold behavior and her black and white thinking, but one night, when we were in a call, she dropped it because I was just joking and she said that it offended her. I was also hurt because I was disrespected. I apologized to her about the joke, simply I just said that she shouldn't have ghosted her internet friends, I thought she'll take it lightly, yet she did not, but I admitted that it was my mistake that I told her that.

The disrespect that she gave me made me felt low. It hurt me. During that time, I really wanted to depart from our relationship, but then she talked to me and handed me her side. I understood her. I took my initiation of splitting up with her because I wanted to be compassionate and I want to know her more, perhaps, a bit more patient to her coldness. I still love her even though it had happened.

Until she stopped being so open to me. There are times that she would be cold, she'll distance herself to me. I had understood why it happened, I communicated it to her, but she said that it really happens. She's trying to pacify it for me, yet it kept going.

I changed that time. I prevented myself to be open to her since I was so worried that it would be unfair that I am sharing something to her, yet she isn't. I don't wish to add up another problem to her. My partner was so insistent about knowing my problems, I end up sharing. It made me guilty, as she is keeping everything by herself, while I am opening up to her.

There are times that she'll get irritated at me, especially at my jokes. Beforehand, we could greatly exchange jokes at each other. She's very patient, but then, it changed. I am not gaslighting ot blaming her though. Her feelings are valid.

She's a working student this time, which is a factor why she changed from something sweet, active, and loving to a cold, avoidant one. It affected our relationship, it also affected me.

I kept asking space for the two of us. There was a time wherein she acted cold and irritated got me overthinking. I actually wanted to break up with her that time, yet I took her stances because I believe that a relation should be a team. I reflected, I told myself to be more restraint.

Until I forgot that I am tolerating someone to hurt me. My view for my partner changed, I got so afraid whenever she went mad, I got so afraid of opening up my thoughts, I got afraid that she won't listen. One time, I reached her out—I opened up my thoughts that I suppressed, she got offended and mad, but I understood it. It's really confusing on what to react because I am burnt out that time. My mind is not functioning. I was afraid to be judged by my partner.

And days after, something happened. We had a date. We ate at a coffee shop. She was from school that day, she travelled 2 hours just to see me. I was also sleep deprived, but I wanted to see her often since we are long distance. When we had our date, inconveniences occurred, but it went well since I took her to an art gallery prior to going to the coffee shop.

While we were in the coffee shop, I felt cold. I was wearing a dress that time, I forgot to bring a jacket or a cardigan. She handed me her jacket and scarf, but I was still feeling cold. Her irritation aroused, she was dealing with her bag that time when she said ""if you're that cold, just wait for me outside,"" her tone was cold, irritated. During that night, I wanted to walk out, but I didn't. My respect and patience for her uplifted.

Another major inconvenience appeared. I had a financial problem. I told her that I wanted to stop going to school because my problems was stifling me. I am concerned with her future which is why I told her to break up with me if she couldn't take my problems anymore. It is so selfish to remain while she's being involved, but I still love her deeply despite of those circumstances.

My partner became colder and distant to me. It made me overthink matters again. I opened up the feeling that I had been feeling when she act cold to me, yet she only stated that it's natural to her. I was offended because I wanted her to simply be kind and sweet to me, but it seems complicated. I talked to her that time, I told her that I don't want to break up with her, she said the same.

Until a time came where I needed her the most. She had seen my messages. I got a major ick. I wasn't informed that she was resting that day, so I acted grumpy. We have a group chat involving my close friends, she got to seen the messages and put a story in her ig account, but she said that she forgot to message me. It had became a fight. It made things worse. I distanced myself to her, unfollowed her, left group chats that she's involved because I was hurt. My partner left me on read. I don't know if it was shallow or immature, but if it is, I admit that it was my mistake.

We had an argument, she triggered me. I opened up to her that she was abusing me emotionally. After saying that, my world stopped when she responded that we should end things anymore because she don't want arguments anymore. Her splitting up with me was indirect, but after how many responses, I got the message, we were drifting apart. Tbh, my mind was so banged that time, I was processing things, and there came my biggest regret, I agreed.

I was on our department ceremony when it happened. It hurts. It took me 10-12 hours to realize that I didn't want to lose her. I messaged her after, but then she got mad. I honestly looked desperate during that time, I was begging her to comeback, I kept believing that she still love me, yet she told me that she felt numb and she's no longer inlove with me.

I wanted to get mad at her, yet I could not. Five days after our break up, I read a lot of forums, listened to songs that I could relate with, accepted the reality that she wouldn't come back to me anymore. We didn't end up in good terms, she was apathetic to me.

It was so complex. Until now, I am still crying. I already accepted the fact that she is already non-existent, yet still, the loneliness and memories keep bringing her back. I wanted to forget her as fast as I could, it's so painful, but it's still a journey to take. I really wish, moving on was that easy. It's so mortifying to have the ability to love someone that deeply.",1,1729520087.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I enjoy rich coffee and wanted an espresso machine but couldn’t drop $700+. So far with the nespresso, I’ve tried the stormio and melozio pods that came in the starter pack. I’m surprised by the sharp, bitter taste. I’d expected a smoother tasting brew. I usually add a little cream to my cup and even with a lot, that sharpness is still there and leaves an old coffee taste in my mouth. Is this typical for nespresso or does it sound like the pods are stale or I need to do something more to set up the machine? TIA. ",1,1729520038.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False
