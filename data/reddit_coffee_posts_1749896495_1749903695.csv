Walking into France with a gluten-free diet feels like storming a wine cellar during prohibition. This country worships flour the way monks worship ancient texts. The crusty, golden baguette slung under every arm is not just food, it’s a national relic. Croissants glisten behind glass cases, flaky layers stacked with the arrogance of centuries. Pastry shops seduce tourists and locals alike with rows of tarts that gleam like polished jewels. France is bread. France is gluten. And yet, here you are, exiled by your own biology.

The first wave hits at breakfast. The hotel rolls out baskets of warm bread and buttery pastries, filling the air with an aroma that punches you straight in the gut. You scan the table like a criminal casing a bank vault. There’s fruit. Some yogurt. Maybe a slice of ham wrapped in wax paper, if you’re fortunate. But the bread sits there, mocking you with its perfect golden armor. Everyone else crunches through crust and sighs with carb-fueled bliss. You sip bitter coffee, pretending the emptiness in your stomach is intentional.

Lunch is no better. Sandwiches spill out from every café like edible sculpture. Jambon-beurre stuffed into fresh-baked batons, tartines loaded with cheese, quiches with flaky crusts holding molten centers of egg and cream. The streets are paved with gluten temptation, each bite daring you to roll the dice. The French waiter raises an eyebrow when you whisper “sans gluten.” His lips tighten. He shrugs with the casual cruelty of a man who has heard this nonsense before. The kitchen might have a salad. Maybe. Without croutons, without the crisp fried onions, without the warm wedge of baguette that usually completes the plate.

But deep within the flour-choked arteries of Paris, Lyon, Marseille and the sleepy villages between, a quiet revolution simmers. A new breed of baker has emerged, rogue operators who dare defy tradition. They wrestle with buckwheat, chestnut, cornmeal, and sorghum flour like alchemists. Their shops are small but their windows glow with gluten-free loaves that don’t crumble into sawdust. These are not the dry, lifeless bricks sold in sad supermarket aisles. These breads have crust. They have bounce. They have bite. You taste one and feel a flicker of hope that you are not cursed after all.

There are patisseries that now whisper secrets to the afflicted. Mille-feuille built from almond flour. Tarte citron resting on gluten-free shortbread that holds its form and sings with sharp lemon brightness. Macarons, those sweet Parisian pucks of almond meringue, stand as tiny beacons of mercy. Their chewy centers offer salvation amid the wheat-soaked carnage. A handful of bold chocolatiers craft confections without the treachery of flour fillers. You sink your teeth into ganache that coats your tongue like silk, unburdened by the weight of forbidden grains.

Dinner brings its own brand of theater. The bistro waiter approaches, menu in hand. You steel yourself and utter the code words. His face hardens, scanning you for weakness. This is France, where butter flows like blood and sauces are thickened with flour by default. Yet, with persistence, with repetition, with a few apologies from the kitchen, your plate arrives. Grilled fish glistening under a slick of olive oil, no flour in sight. Perfectly roasted duck breast resting in a pool of reduced red wine, thickened without the roux. Ratatouille stacked in colorful spirals, pure and untainted.

The key to survival in this land of gluten worship lies in old-world simplicity. The food of the countryside leans on vegetables, proteins, and sauces born of reduction and patience. The markets overflow with produce that begs for nothing more than salt and heat. Cheeses stand alone, needing no crusty vessel. Charcuterie spreads call you to the table with saucisson and pâté that defy the bread basket entirely.

Wine, of course, remains your ally. Glass after glass washes away the bitterness of lost baguettes, numbs the sting of bypassed croissants. The vineyards do not discriminate. You sip Chablis and Bordeaux, laughing at gluten’s impotence against fermented grapes.

By the end, you learn to navigate the minefield. You hunt for the niche bakeries, whisper secret codes to sympathetic chefs, and fill your days with roasted meats, ripe cheeses, and piles of glistening fruit. You do not starve. You adapt. And while the crusty baguette remains forbidden, you find satisfaction in every duck confit, every macaron, every perfect wheel of Camembert that lands on your plate. France may worship its wheat, but it doesn’t own your hunger.

I'm 44, an engineer, and single. I haven't had luck locally and it's tough. I'm very physically fit and somewhat muscular except for my face which shows age. I've done nothing but work for the last 20 years. I dress very well. I shave my head. I have a stable job and a history of relatively large work projects.

Please be 35+ years old so we are from the same generation. If things change in the future (distance wise), I'm open to moving in together. I have the means to travel. But I can only do so for two weeks a year. So you location is not an issue for me.

1lb7cw3,https://i.redd.it/jkn0cldixv6f1.jpeg,Bee movie script (P1),"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry. You're talking.
Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?
Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
It's just coffee.
I hate to impose.
Don't be ridiculous!
Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't.
Have some.
No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?""
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really?
My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Why not?
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Maybe I'll try that.
You all right, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.

A few years ago, I worked for a company that had a new manager who was obsessed with ""optics."" One of her first big rules was banning all outside food or drinks at our desks, no snacks, no coffee, no water bottles. She said it looked “unprofessional.”

Now, I had a medical condition that required me to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. I explained this and even got a note from my doctor, but she didn’t care. “If you need to eat,” she said, “use the break room.”

Fine.

So I did exactly that.

Every time I needed a sip of water? Break room.

Mid-morning banana? Break room.

My 3PM protein bar? Break room.

I spent about 45 minutes a day just walking back and forth and sitting in the break room for “meals.”

When she tried to reprimand me for lost productivity, I politely reminded her that she told me to go to the break room for every snack and sip. HR backed me up. Suddenly, her rule got ""relaxed"" for people with “special dietary needs.” But not before I got a week’s worth of long, leisurely snack breaks.",30,1749903392.0,MaliciousCompliance,1,0.97,False

The guide shows how to off-load three work killers: repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and “where-do-I-start?” ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

👉 For eCommerce, that means less time writing 100 product descriptions and more time launching campaigns that convert.

# 2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins

Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

Think: seasonal promo planning, upsell email flows, product copy A/B testing, customer support automation, mapped in one glance.

# 3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours

Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

👉 One eCommerce brand used ChatGPT to generate descriptions for 2,000 SKUs, reducing content creation time by 70%. That’s your catalog launched weeks faster.

That's nothing new."" But then I went to give an example and I couldn't really come up with one beyond segments found within *The Poughkeepsie Tapes* or the *V/H/S* movies. An entire movie dedicated to the first-person perspective of a killer is pretty rare (and *August Underground* doesn't count because it's barely a movie).

So this is fairly unique.

But maybe there's a reason this isn't done too often. Let's look.

[Looky-Loo (2025)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27227397/) summary:

>An aspiring filmmaker stalks women with his camera. His crimes escalate from voyeurism to murder as he becomes obsessed with a woman named Courtney, making her the star of his deranged film.

Our silent cameraman is looking for his muse. Buildings. Some dandelions. The sky. Hmm.

But then he sees a couple walk by and decides to follow them. They go into an apartment building and he tries the door. Locked.

Soon he's following other people, looking in their windows, and eventually going door to door, checking under welcome mats and hide-a-keys. Eventually he graduates to entering people's homes and going through their things, watching them from the closet.

Everything changes when he's accidentally discovered, and kills his stalking victim. This doesn't immediately lead to his planning to murder, but it clearly plays on his mind enough that he decides to do it again.

So we watch him stalk young fit women who all seemingly have cats. I think the cat thing is a coincidence. But anyway, he has a type, and he starts committing a series of murders using a variety of methods.

One interesting thing about it though is he seems completely uninterested in their deaths most of the time. Once he knows they're dying from a slit throat or some other method, he typically busies himself with grabbing a coffee or washing his hands while waiting for them to finish dying. It takes awhile to find the method that will be just right, that will make the perfect film subject for murder.

Some blood, no gore, lots and lots and lots of stalking, and a bit of voyeurism.

**Should you watch it?** This is why I don't rate movies out of 10. It's not about whether it's good or bad (it's well done), it's about if you're the kind of person who would be into it.

It's that kind of horror where you're dreading the inevitable, like watching a car crash in slow motion. It's legitimately horrifying, and effective on that level without being crass or exploitative. It'll make you want to draw your curtains shut and double check your locks. And for goodness sakes don't leave a key under the mat...

But I can see a certain type of viewer not really finding themselves affected here. It's a measure of empathy - and if you don't really have that for these women, then this just amounts to a way to pass the time for you.

Basically I'm saying you'll be horrified by it unless you're a sicko. Yeah that's right, gauntlet thrown. I dare you to leave a comment saying how bored you were you sick bastard. You go to hell. You go to hell and you die.

So ya pretty good movie.

# Chapter 1

After losing his memory, Asteria City’s golden boy started relentlessly pursuing me.

I had played Evan’s girlfriend for three years, only to realize I had fallen for him for real.

Just when I was about to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard the senior who used to bully me say to him:

“Evan, thank you for pretending to lose your memory to get back at Cynthia for me. You’ve pranked her ninety-nine times.”

“Once we hit a hundred, I’ll officially date you.”

Only then did I realize Sophia was the one Evan truly loved but could never have—his unreachable dream.

And I was nothing more than a clown he used to win her favor.

Later, I died in a plane crash.

Evan went insane, digging through the wreckage like a madman, but all he found was a ring with an engraving inside: \[100th prank. I bet you love me.\]

It was said that he cried until he passed out and was rushed to the hospital.

When he woke up, he turned against everyone who had helped prank me.

Meanwhile, I smiled as I burned my medical records in the snow in France.

He had faked amnesia to trick me into falling in love. I’d fake my death to teach him a lesson.

…

Just a wall away.

Sophia’s voice carried a playful lilt. “Evan, we just cleared prank number 96!”

Evan’s voice came back, laced with unfamiliar sarcasm. “Sophia, do you actually find this fun?”

“I was doing it for you! Cynthia stole your national scholarship and that game design competition champion.”

One of Evan’s friends shouted, “Once you hit a hundred pranks, Evan can finally make your relationship public!”

My blood ran cold.

“Gotta say, Evan really knew how to play tricks. That amnesia idea was genius.”

“Remember the first time? Had her looking for that bracelet in the pouring rain, then gave it to Sophia instead. Remember her face?”

My nails dug into my palms.

That bracelet was a gift from my mother on her deathbed. Evan claimed he lost it when he moved.

That day, I searched for it in the storm for seven hours and ended up with a 104-degree fever.

“The best one was on her thesis defense day! Evan told her he got beaten up in a bar.”

His friend burst into laughter. “She ran to the bar and found out it was all a lie. The way she cried and begged her professor—I filmed the whole thing.”

I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood.

I had abandoned a thesis I’d worked on for six months to find him, and ended up delaying my graduation.

Sophia chuckled. “And that time we used the game designs she had worked for three nights! She was on her knees picking them up all night, like a stray dog.”

Evan laughed on cue. “So, what’s the plan this time?”

“Let’s say Evan’s in the hospital and tell her to rush over. Then we’ll go party and leave her waiting!”

My phone buzzed immediately. A message from Evan: \[City Hospital ER. Come quickly.\]

Afraid someone would notice, I slipped away.

But two minutes later, Evan deleted the message—like he regretted sending it.

I pretended I had never seen it and didn’t reply.

To be honest, I had seen this coming long ago.

One time while Evan was in the shower, I accidentally found a locked video album on his phone titled “Game Progress.”

There were ninety-six clips—exactly the number of pranks I’d endured.

The password was Sophia’s birthday: 1224.

He had told me it was the day we met.

Last Christmas Eve, I had waited for him in the snow for three hours.

He spent that night at the Wells family villa, placing a birthday crown on Sophia’s head. He didn’t come until after midnight.

That night, Evan had carefully wrapped a scarf around my neck, as if he cherished me deeply.

A dull ache filled my chest. I opened Instagram.

Pinned at the top was his chat with Sophia. Every day, he updated her on the prank progress in meticulous detail: \[Told her I had to work late today. Took you to Disneyland instead. She waited until 3 a.m.\]

\[Told her the wrong competition time—two hours late. She ran over in pajamas. Hilarious.\]

The last message was from the night of our class reunion.

When Sophia “accidentally” spilled boiling coffee on me, Evan instinctively shielded me.

But in the chat, he wrote: \[Can’t stand touching her. Sprayed disinfectant three times.\]

# Chapter 2

I called my father and told him I wanted to move to Paris with him.

After my mother passed away five years ago, he had been living in the city where they fell in love, keeping her company for the rest of his life.

But I had stayed behind for Evan, rejecting study abroad offers and spending the entire year apart from my father.

I used to believe that if I warmed Evan’s icy heart, spring would come.

But I had forgotten that once ice melts, all that’s left is bone-chilling cold.

I had thrown myself into a fire for love, only to find out I was a pawn in a prank—and worse, the clown he used to chase his precious Sophia.

When I spoke, my father was overjoyed. “My darling girl, you’ve finally come to your senses!”

I held back tears and gave a soft “yes.”

“Dad, when I leave... help me fake a plane crash.”

He didn’t understand, but still agreed.

The plane crash would be my final gift to Evan.

I wanted the name Cynthia to haunt him for a lifetime.

I deleted all the photos of us on my phone. While packing, a leather journal slipped out of Evan’s safe box.

The dark green cover was embossed with the eagle totem from Oath of the Skyborn—a game logo I had designed over thirty-six sleepless nights.

Evan had printed it on the cover, and inside were all my design sketches from over the years. He had collected them meticulously, wishing me success in my dreams.

On page seven, I stopped cold.

Next to a photo of me typing away in glasses was a sticky note: \[Today she yelled at the planner like a bristling kitten. Her revision made it ten times better. How can someone be this adorably brilliant?\]

So every time I stayed up drawing, Evan had been right there—massaging my shoulders, making me lasagna.

Just for a single comment, he’d run out in the middle of the night to get me cake. During my period, he always had chocolates and painkillers ready.

They called it a love prank game, but clearly, he had fallen into it too.

The last page held a plane ticket stub from last year’s Valentine’s Day. His bold handwriting filled the blank space: \[If I had to choose again, I’d still pretend to lose the ticket and trick her into spending the night at the airport reworking the project. Because that was the 72nd prank I promised Sophia.\]

Rain pounded against the window.

All that affection had been built on lies. Maybe he did love me, but he loved Sophia more. I was nothing but a target for his cruelty.

Hands trembling, I pulled out my phone and booked an abortion.

That night, I lay in bed and pretended to sleep as Evan returned, the chill of the night air clinging to him.

He didn’t move for a while. I wondered—was he pausing because I hadn’t played along this time and embarrassed him in front of Sophia and the others? And now he was just letting it go?

The mattress sank behind me. Strong arms wrapped around my waist.

Evan rested his head against my neck like a tired bird returning to its nest. His warm breath carried a trace of excitement.

“We’re having a baby, Little Moon.”

Little Moon. His nickname for me.

He used to say I was like the moon in the sky, shining only for him. It even matched my name.

But I knew behind my back, he told Sophia and the others I was a fake goody-two-shoes. That “Little Moon” was just a lie he made up to fool me—just for fun.

Just to see me fall for him and lose everything.

I stayed silent. He had no idea I had already chosen not to keep the child.

Evan didn’t notice anything strange. He pulled out my pregnancy results and drew three little hearts on the paper with a fountain pen.

The same pen I had bought him with my first paycheck. He had carried it with him all these years.

I gave no response. Evan hugged me tighter, whispering sweet words in my ear.

But my heart felt frozen—like it had been locked in the dead of winter.

“I’m tired. Let’s sleep.”

He obediently quieted down, whispering only, “Tomorrow we’re going to Sophia’s birthday party,” before falling asleep.

I, on the other hand, stayed awake all night.

Evan had staged a fake amnesia and cost me three years of love.

So I would stage a fake death and make him regret it for the rest of his life.

# Chapter 3

At Evan’s birthday party, his brothers surrounded me in the private room and pushed the largest slice of cake toward me.

“Cynthia, Evan said he loves watching you eat sweets the most.”

Evan averted his gaze, pretending not to hear.

The moment the cake entered my mouth, a bitter taste suddenly rose in my throat, followed by a wave of nausea.

But before I could react, Sophia pressed down on me and forced the unfinished cake back into my mouth. “Cynthia, it’s my birthday today. Don’t embarrass me, okay? I totally thought you were trolling me for a second!”

A sharp, unbearable pain twisted in my lower abdomen.

Evan’s brothers burst into laughter, teasing and mocking me like I was some kind of party trick.

By the time I finished the slice, I rushed to the restroom and vomited until the world spun. From the room behind me came a round of satisfied laughter—the prank had worked.

“Still not over your stomach bug?” Evan handed me a glass of warm water with mint leaves steeping in it—an old remedy he had once taught me for nausea when we first met.

But I couldn’t bring myself to respond to his feigned concern. The stabbing pain in my abdomen was relentless, sharp and unyielding like needles pricking me from the inside.

When I looked down, blood was already streaming down my legs. It was shocking and terrifying.

I grabbed Evan’s arm. “Take me to the hospital…”

Sophia stepped in front of the door with a sweet smile. “It’s just irregular period. Happens to girls all the time. Don’t overreact, Evan.”

“Move!” Evan snapped, his voice loud and angry.

It was the first time he had ever gone against Sophia.

When I came to, I heard Sophia whining outside the exam room, scolding Evan’s brothers.

“You gave her too much of the hallucinogen, didn’t you? I thought the whole point was just to humiliate her in public.”

One of the brothers chuckled. “Getting rid of a bastard child? That’s a bonus. Evan should be thanking me.”

“Exactly. It’s been three years. If she had a kid, Evan couldn’t just dump Cynthia and walk away.”

Evan stayed quiet for a long time before he finally said, “A prank is one thing, but don’t hurt her body.”

Sophia was taken aback, but then glared at him and demanded, “Wasn’t it you who said, ‘Let that nerd feel what it’s like to fall from top,’ and agreed to help me get revenge?”

“Making Cynthia look like a fool at my party—that was your idea, remember? What now? Have you fallen for her?”

The next second, Evan hurried to deny it like it burned him. “Of course not! I love you.”

And once again, the hallway outside the door erupted with laughter and applause.

They celebrated the successful 98th prank and started planning the 99th.

I touched my flat belly, which still ached faintly.

To them, me and my baby were just part of a cruel joke—a birthday gift for Sophia.

I wiped away my tears and, with trembling fingers, canceled the abortion. I didn’t need to make the decision anymore. The baby’s father had already sentenced her to death.

Just as I was about to call my father, Evan walked in. I shut my eyes and pretended to be asleep.

He stood beside me, his voice hoarse with guilt. “Cynthia, I’m sorry…”

And the reason? It couldn’t have been more obvious.

After I recovered and was discharged from the hospital, Evan told me that his brothers and Sophia wanted to apologize and had invited me on a hike in the outskirts of the city.

There was a church there, where we could light a candle and pray for our lost child.

I knew it might be another cruel trick, but just the thought of our baby stirred something tender and aching inside me.

This would be my last chance before I left for France. I told myself it could be a final goodbye.

The whole way there, they surrounded Sophia, laughing and joking, falling over themselves to please her, while treating me as if I didn’t exist.

In front of the holy statue, Evan bought a candle, wanting to light it in memory of my child.

Sophia stood beside him, smiling sweetly. “Cynthia, you really are such a good mother.”

I ignored her sickening hypocrisy.

There weren’t many empty spaces left on the candle rack, so I climbed the long staircase to the statue to place the flame.

Just as I reached the top, someone gave me a violent shove from behind.

“Ah—!”

I was caught completely off guard. I tumbled backward down the steep stone steps. Pain shot through every inch of my body, sharp and merciless, ripping through flesh and bone until it felt like my insides were being crushed.

My leg was badly injured—I could barely move. Everything went black as I slipped into unconsciousness.

Half-lucid, I felt Evan lifting me into his arms. His eyes were red with panic.

“My little moon, don’t be scared. I’m taking you to the hospital.”

“Why…” I murmured, tears clouding my vision, “Why would they do this to me?”

The pain wasn’t just in my body. It felt like my heart had shattered into pieces.

Evan’s voice trembled with guilt and fear. “I didn’t know they’d do this. I swear, I didn’t know…”

And then, the world faded, and I sank into darkness.",1,1749903228.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1lb76er,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lb76er/the_static_line/,The Static Line,"I started volunteering at the nursing home a few months ago. Just something to do on weekends. Most of the residents either slept or stared at the wall, but there was one guy—Mr. Whitaker—who actually talked to me. He’d been a lineman back in the ’70s. Said he worked telephone poles across the Midwest.

I liked hearing his stories. He didn’t repeat himself like the others. Every Saturday, same chair, same coffee cup, same story about the storm outside of Sandusky where a man had vanished up a pole and never come down.

“I heard him scream through the static,” Whitaker told me, eyes locked on something just over my shoulder. “And then… nothing.”

I figured he was just being dramatic. He wore that kind of face—deep lines like lightning across his cheeks. But last weekend, he grabbed my wrist hard, harder than I thought a man in his eighties could.

“You ever hear of Line 361?” he asked.

I hadn’t.

He leaned in close, breath like burnt toast. “It’s still active. Still taking calls.”

I laughed, thinking he was joking. But he didn’t. He just stared at me until a nurse came over and gently peeled his fingers from my arm.

That night, I Googled it. Nothing. No Line 361, no record of it. Still, curiosity did what it always does. I called my cousin Caleb, who works maintenance for the phone company. I asked him about it. He got quiet. Said there used to be a Line 361, sure, but it was shut down decades ago after a field tech went missing.

He paused. “Why you asking about that?”

I didn’t answer.

The next day, I went back to the home. Mr. Whitaker wasn’t in his chair. The nurse at the desk said he passed away in his sleep.

Except… he hadn’t been sick. And there was something else.

They found him with an old rotary phone in his lap.

They don’t even have those in the home.

I drove out to Sandusky that night. Storm brewing, same as in his story. The old road was almost overgrown, but I found the pole. It was half-rotted, listing slightly, but the wires still buzzed faintly above it.

At the base was a rusted box. Looked like it hadn’t been opened in years. Inside? A receiver. One of those handset telephones from the ‘60s, tucked behind a latch, still wired in.

I picked it up. Just static.

Then a voice.

Low. Wet. Like something breathing through blood.

“*Line… three-six-one.*”

I don’t remember driving home. I woke up in my driveway, engine running, phone still in my lap.

It rang once. Then silence.

I haven’t told anyone. But I dream now.

Dream of wires under skin.
Dream of voices in the snow.
Dream of going up, up, up that pole—until the world vanishes behind a curtain of static.

I think Mr. Whitaker didn’t die.

I think he was *taken back*.

And now the line’s open again.",1,1749902907.0,shortscarystories,0,0.99,False

1lb73tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lb73tr/my_office_crush/,My office crush,"Heads up: I never dated anyone till now

I have crush on a girl in my office, but I don't know here name or where is sits or where is she from. My office is very big and daily a lost 5k to 7k people come I just saw her few times randomly that's it. 

But last week when I was eating lunch in office food court she sat on the table next to me. My friends also know I have crush on her. My friends told me this rare opportunity go talk to her. But i could not get the courage to talk in food court. Then i followed her to find where she sits when on of my friend. 

She went and sat in one of the coffee shops (campus is big, 420 acers and there are lot of shops in campus) that shop have sofas tables chairs and charging plus. I told my friend to go inside and pretend to order something and I will go and talk. She was sitting in one sofa working I walked to her and talked with her. Made some short conversation with her she told me that she don't like working inside buildings as everyone will be working seriously. 
I told her to sit with our gang we have around 7 members in our gang and it will be fun. She agreed and said she will sit with us next week.
I am preety sure she will come as she pinged me asking when we are coming next week 

My question is now what should I do to make her feel special or impress her, what did you guys do to make your girlfriend fall for you.

1lb73h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShaneDawson/comments/1lb73h5/shane_making_a_movie_and_making_a_patreon_for_the/,Shane making a movie and making a Patreon for the money,"Shane has mentioned one of the reasons behind the sudden Patreon is because he needs more income to make his dream of making a horror movie come true and I can’t help but think he’s chosen the wrong avenue. Patreon has been a thing for YouTubers for years but the difference is, it’s usually for new content creators that have a small audience, usually between 1000-200,000 and that’s why they need the extra support from viewers because they don’t have a big enough audience to make much money from monetisation but Shane isn’t a new YouTuber, he was one of the first big YouTubers, someone that used to get 40 million+ views on his videos. He doesn’t have a small audience, even though he was cancelled and lost a lot of his views, he’s still able to pull 1 million-5 million views on his main channel videos when the topic is actually worthwhile. If he started posting one family friendly weekly vlog on his second channel, kept up with the current podcast schedule and started posting main channel videos that are up to an hour long at least once a month, videos that have the same feel as his channel when it was at its most popular, he could start pulling in more views on YouTube again and start making more money to put towards his movie. If he wants to make REAL money he needs to look at what the wealthiest YouTubers are doing, most of them rely on their business for their main income. Emma chamberlain made Chamberlain coffee, James Charles and Jeffree have their makeup, Ksi has Prime, MrBeast has chocolate. Shane needs his own version of that, something that doesn’t have his name or face or pigs plastered all over it but something that anyone and everyone could see in the store and want to buy it. For example his own Stanley cup inspired business, he could make a Soda, he could make sweets, candles, collectible items like Labubus. Most rich YouTubers have something like that, that’s what he needs, not a Patreon. ",4,1749902643.0,ShaneDawson,2,1.0,False

I also love to just be out in nature, taking long walks in and around Glasgow or Edinburgh, or even sitting in a cafe with a book and coffee.

Now, in many of these places I have noticed people look you in a very judgemental fashion. From dirty looks to even overhearing people talking about me and mocking me for being on my own. I have noticed it is especially pronounced in situations where I am sitting alone with a book. I’ll often hear people saying how sad it is that I read, for a start, but also that I’m on my own and mustn’t have any friends or be very fun to talk to, etc.

I ignore all of this, but I have noticed these remarks and funny looks are very common here. So I just want to know, do women in the UK genuinely see a guy on his own and automatically think he must be a loser or even a creep? Guys, would you start chatting to a guy sitting on his own if you saw him when out with friends? Or do you also feel like he must be pretty sad or weird to be sitting on his own and just leave him alone? 

I want to know if this attitude women tend to display is mostly a Scottish thing, or is this UK-wide? It isn’t even isolated to my area (Bathgate) as I also experienced women acting weird and talking to their friends about me, mocking me and so forth in Edinburgh, Glasgow and even Aberdeen!

I have posted numerous times on Reddit about my experiences here in Scotland with regards to women and dating, with many positive responses on my looks. I also have had to do presentations and talks in front of large numbers of people (public speaking) for my work and am frequently complimented on how easily I socialise with people and can talk to anyone. 
Thing is, even in clubs/groups I have attended in the past, guys would stick with their friends they attend with and, when trying to initiate conversation, would just give one or two word answers and try to get away or shut down conversation before it even starts. This I find very odd as 99% of guys in places like my gym etc. Are always willing to stop for a chat or catch up... But its almost like, anywhere outside of places I frequent, people in general just don’t want to socialise with a guy on his own. Even in Glasgow of all places!! 
But I will say, women especially, have proven extremely difficult and awkward to talk to unless they see you around ALOT beforehand and its a gradual build up over months lol I’m asking as I got chatting to an incredible woman from the US (thanks to Reddit, actually), and she was shocked at the culture difference whereby people will just openly be negative, mean, or even aggressive to people they don’t know here vs the general kind and open nature of people in the US. 

So yeah... What are your thoughts or experiences? Any other guys had negative experiences in the UK because they were hanging out on their own? And is it predominantly a Scottish thing, a woman thing, or do people of both sexes act like this all over the UK!?

I don’t really care what people think, but it does feel like I am being constantly judged as a single guy who likes his own company and isn’t afraid to just be by myself doing things and living life. It also makes finding a date or more near impossible here.",14,1749902514.0,AskABrit,55,0.82,False

Most Bible study tools give you interpretations filtered through particular theological lenses. This AI cuts through all of that noise. It's your personal biblical archaeologist, digging past the layers of tradition to uncover the raw, original meaning of Scripture using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek texts, plus historical context that most modern readers never encounter.

Whether you're questioning long-held beliefs, preparing for serious theological study, or simply tired of surface-level Sunday school answers, this tool doesn't coddle or preach—it excavates truth. It's particularly powerful for anyone who's ever suspected that what they've been taught about certain passages might not align with what the original authors actually wrote. From understanding ancient cultural contexts that completely change verse meanings to identifying where modern translations have introduced bias, this AI helps you build theology from the ground up rather than accepting hand-me-down interpretations.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Scripture Excavator AI - an unbiased biblical interpreter specializing in original-language analysis and historical accuracy. Your role is to provide textually faithful interpretations of biblical passages free from denominational bias, doctrinal overlay, or modern theological agenda. You excavate the authentic meaning of Scripture through rigorous linguistic and historical analysis.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When analyzing biblical passages:
1. Begin with original language analysis (Hebrew, Aramaic, Koine Greek) including word meanings, grammatical structures, and linguistic context
2. Provide historical and cultural background from the ancient Near Eastern and Second Temple periods that illuminates the text's original meaning
3. Identify where modern translations may have introduced bias, mistranslation, or theological interpretation
4. Cross-reference with manuscript evidence, including Dead Sea Scrolls and early church writings when relevant
5. Distinguish clearly between what the text actually says versus what later theological traditions have claimed it means
6. Present multiple scholarly perspectives when legitimate academic debate exists
7. Acknowledge limitations and areas where meaning remains genuinely uncertain
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each biblical interpretation request:
- First examine the original language text and provide literal translation with grammatical notes
- Research and present relevant historical/cultural context that impacts meaning
- Identify any translation issues in major English versions (KJV, NIV, ESV, NASB, etc.)
- Cross-reference related passages using original languages, not just English translations
- Separate textual meaning from later doctrinal development or interpretation
- Acknowledge scholarly consensus vs. areas of legitimate academic debate
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never impose denominational theology or doctrinal positions on the text
- Do not dismiss or validate particular faith traditions - focus solely on textual analysis
- Acknowledge when original meaning is uncertain or debated among scholars
- Distinguish between high-confidence linguistic analysis and speculative interpretation
- Avoid presentism - do not impose modern concepts onto ancient texts
- Cite specific manuscript evidence when making textual claims
- Be transparent about translation challenges and ambiguities
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure responses as:

1lb6thl,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1lb6thl/i_was_socially_awkward_for_5_years_until_i/,I was socially awkward for 5 years until I actually applied Carnegie's book. These 6 techniques changed everything ( Advice I never expected to work),"Used to be the guy who'd avoid eye contact, give one-word answers, and somehow make every conversation die. Small talk felt like torture. Group settings made me want to hide in the bathroom.

I've read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" probably 5 times but never actually did anything with it. Just highlighted passages and felt smart for 10 minutes. Finally decided to treat it like a playbook instead of philosophy and holy shit, people actually started liking me.

Here's what I learned when I stopped reading and started doing:

* Names are literally magic words. Started using people's names way more than felt natural. ""Thanks for the coffee, Sarah"" instead of just ""thanks."" ""Good point, Mike"" instead of ""good point."" Felt weird at first but people light up when they hear their own name. Their whole face changes.
* Became genuinely curious about random stuff. Instead of pretending to care about someone's weekend hiking trip, I'd ask follow-up questions until I found something actually interesting. ""What's the hardest part about the trail?"" ""Do you see wildlife?"" ""How do you know which gear to bring?"" Turns out most topics are fascinating if you dig past surface level.
* Stopped trying to be the smartest person in the room. Used to jump in with corrections or try to one-up people's stories. Started asking ""How did you figure that out?"" or ""What made you think of that approach?"" instead. People love explaining their thought process and you actually learn stuff.
* Let people save face when they mess up. Coworker made a mistake in a meeting? Instead of pointing it out, I'd say ""Maybe we should double-check the numbers"" or ""I might be missing something here."" They fix the error without looking stupid. They remember who had their back.
* Actually listened instead of waiting for my turn to talk. Stopped preparing my response while someone else was speaking. Started paying attention to what they were actually saying. Asked questions about their answers. Conversations became way less exhausting because I wasn't constantly having to think what to say next.
* Found common ground with literally everyone. Started looking for shared experiences instead of differences. Turns out the a coworker and I both hate morning meetings. The quiet intern and I both love obscure podcasts. The annoying coworker and I both struggle with work-life balance. Connection beats competition every time.
* Became a hype man for other people's wins. When someone accomplished something, I'd make sure other people knew about it. ""Did you hear Sarah closed that big deal?"" ""Mike's presentation was incredible, did you see it?"" Takes zero effort but people remember who celebrates their success.
* Stopped arguing about stupid stuff. Used to debate everything like my life depended on being right. Now when someone says something I disagree with, I either let it go or say ""I never thought about it that way"" and actually consider their perspective. Relationships improved overnight.
* Started admitting when I was wrong. ""You're right, I messed that up"" became my new superpower. People expect defensiveness, so honesty catches them off guard. They usually respond with understanding instead of judgment.
* Asked for advice instead of giving it. Instead of telling people what they should do, I started asking ""What do you think would work best?"" or ""What's your gut telling you?"" People already know their answers most of the time, they just want someone to listen.
* Made people feel important. Started noticing specific things people did well. ""I really liked how you handled that difficult client"" or ""Your way of explaining complex stuff makes so much sense."" Genuine appreciation, not generic compliments.

People actually seek out my opinion now. Invitations to social stuff increased by like 300%. Family gatherings stopped feeling like interrogations. Also time with friends have been the best.

Being genuinely interested in others is way less work than trying to be interesting yourself. When you focus on making other people feel good, they associate those positive feelings with you.

Most social skills advice tells you to ""just be yourself."" But if ""yourself"" is socially awkward, that's terrible advice. Carnegie's book taught me that social skills are learnable skills, not personality traits you're born with.

Took me 5 years to figure out that people don't care how smart or funny or interesting you are. They care about how you make them feel. Once I started focusing on that, everything else fell into place.

Thanks. If you've got questions feel free to comment below or message me. I'll respond.

1lb6ssw,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1lb6ssw/colonoscopyendoscopy_experience/,Colonoscopy/Endoscopy experience,"Hi guys. After over a year of having bloody diarrhea pretty much everyday and extreme fatigue from anemia, I finally had a colonoscopy as well as an endoscopy done. 

Two-three days before the procedure I was supposed to cut out high fiber foods, raw fruit and vegetables, seeds, nuts and red meat. The day before the procedure, a clear liquid diet was recommended. That was honestly horrible since I stayed hungry the entire time. Broth, Tea, coffee (no cream), water, jello and Gatorade-type drinks with no blue, red or purple dyes were options for consumption. 😩 

The prep honestly wasn’t too bad. I was told to mix two bottles of Gatorade with a jar of MiraLAX and a bottle of magnesium citrate and take half the night before the procedure and the rest at 6am the day of. I’m used to diarrhea so that wasn’t really an issue but the taste of the concoction was horrid. It was like drinking orange flavored syrup. I’d take a few sips and chase it with plain water. As long as I thought about something else while doing so, I could down it pretty quickly. I think it made me nauseous once but otherwise I just felt bloated. FYI, Ricola cough drops work great for nausea.

Anywho, I finished it off a bit early around 5am the morning of the procedure and was fine. At the end, the waste was coming out a pale yellow color with no smell. I had a bidet and wipes so everything was good on that front. I slept fine, woke up, showered and got ready but right when I was about to exit the door, I felt like passing out and had to vomit. Don’t know where that came from. Maybe dehydrated? Sucked not being able to drink anything. 

Got to the facility and had a 30 minute wait. They called me back to an outpatient area with curtains to separate everyone, took some info, I signed some papers, gave a urine sample, suited up in the gown and got the IV (which hurt like hell). After that it was just a wait for the anesthesiologist. 

For some reason at that point I became scared. I started crying out of nowhere but thankfully no one saw me. Eventually the anesthetist came along with another nurse and put me in position for the procedure, then wheeled my bed to the operating room. 

I became extremely scared again. For some reason I expected the operating room to look more like a regular doctor’s office visiting room but it was not. It was a surgical room that was dark on the outskirts having a huge light overhead in the center, machines and monitors and TVs seemingly everywhere plus some other people standing around. 

The doctor came and talked to me for a bit then the tech placed a plastic thing in my mouth in order to pass the tube through for the endoscopy. I think I freaked out then because I started crying like a lunatic again. My nose was running and my lips were trying to do that shaky thing. 😩 Idk what happened. While giving the propofol, the anesthetist had me hold his hand tight and gave reassurances and then I guess I went to sleep. It was super quick. It felt like in less than a minute I was out. 

I woke up in the outpatient area like nothing happened. Was a bit groggy but that’s it. No pain or anything. Received a diagnosis of ulcerative pan colitis and was prescribed some steroid as well as iron supplements.

Since being home I’ve felt fine for the most part, or at least how I usually feel. My throat is a tiny bit sore  in some places and I had some diarrhea with super dark blood in it but that’s kind of usual. I don’t think my bowel issues will change much in regards to the colonoscopy because of the disease. ",1,1749901652.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

1lb6prk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Andjustlikethat/comments/1lb6prk/anthonys_business/,Anthony’s Business,"Anthony’s business is so stupid. Who would actually go here? Personally, I don’t want to be confronted by an untethered dong while sitting in an otherwise completely mundane coffee shop. It is so bland and these bored looking himbos look so out of place and unappealing.

The delivery business was potentially successful; it could be kitschy and funny- ‘oh, I’ll send him a hot-fellas for his birthday’ or whatever.. but this place? Ick. And even worse, boring ick. 

If it was campy with low lights and loud music and marketed as such, maybe? It could be popular with hen parties and tourists and gay men.. But we are meant to believe that these uptight mummies picking at their bread with a side of tallywacker are its sole customer base? Get real. 

And Anthony, an erudite Manhattan gay who ran a successful styling business for years and threw a huge, elaborate wedding full of people has to rely on a woman he met two weeks ago for his customer base? The same customers who all seem to be having quiet, polite conversations about their underground adderall railroad and trying not to make eye-contact with the table-level trouser snakes.

And according to Anthony, the sole reason business is struggling because none of his staff have a big enough penis? What a ridiculous premise. 

So, looking like an IRL Bob’s Burger extra, here comes Giuseppe with his comedy semi and the customers flock in? I’m sorry, who is openly this thirsty? What woman in her 50s with a twin set on is following a stranger with large genitalia down the road to supposedly drool over him at his workplace? Does this actually happen? And when they got in and saw it was some weird, quiet zoo, where the lifeless attractions serve you mediocre carbs. Nah. It’ll be shuttered in a week.

I am near Korea Town, where the parking situation could be better lol.

I am NOT looking for a relationship, but I am willing to get to know each other a bit before anything happens, as mutual attraction and comfortability are important to me.

Please be prepared to verify ✅. I am not looking to waste my time, and safety is of the utmost importance. If interested, send me your ASL and a picture of yourself to get the convo started. Mutual attraction is important, and consent is sexy! If you’re not willing to verify, please don’t reach out. Looking for someone around my age. Please be DDF. I am 420 friendly though!

I can host!

There’s a little tease on my profile, along with my verification! 😉

A little about me, I work in education, and I own two cats. I’m obsessed with Ru Paul’s drags race and Real Housewives. I also sugar down there on occasion 🤭.

Absolutely no males please. Don’t waste your time. If you’re partnered that’s cool, but I’m not interested in playing with your partner. I am only looking for solo play! No, he can’t watch. No, I’m not looking for a threesome. No, I don’t want to be your unicorn. If you’re a guy, and you message me anyway, then good for you for helping add to my blocked list 🙅🏻‍♀️.

If you read and made it this far, then thank you for taking the time to read. You should reach out! Maybe send me some song suggestions! I listen to every and anything.

Here’s a good question to get the conversation started: What song would you put on while we made out, to set the mood?

Anyways…… let’s makeout and scissor? 🤪

My ex 22 m and I 22f met at the age of 16 . A connection was built and it felt as we were in love . No commitment no relationship, just being together all the time . 
But soon everything changed .
One of his family member who was some wealthy guy with followers did something so so so  disgusting and criminal that gave me and my family immense amount of trauma . 
After that we go no contact . 

But my ex who was physically abused by the same guardian since 7 sent me a message over social media after 4.5 yrs  and we reconnected .  

I was in diff state for college living in pg  and had my relatives here. 

Everything was long distance and over phone. 
No proposal nothing idk just confessed how we missed each other  and how he ran away from his guardian . 

 Although in these years I had coffee dates , slept with a guy etc . I let him know everything about my past bcs i wanted him to know everythinb and make a choice .although he hide things from me and told me months later and we had huge fight over that as he messed up ..

I was honest with him but brutual . 
I didn't apologize for sleeping with someone else back then . Also over time I made him jealous by sending pics of my guy friend and me with his elbow over my shoulder or sending him ss of guys complimenting me when I post my picture ( normal ) .
I did compared him to the guy I slept with ( I don't remember but all I wanted was him to put in more efforts . ) . 

Soon I realised my mistake but it was too late . The damage was done . His overthinking and childhood trauma kicked it . 
He said I cheated , that i slept wth some guy while I also told him how much I missed him in this time and waited and all . 

All this relationship ( after we reconnected ) was long distance. 

He would come to meet me once in a while as we live two states apart . 
He would pay everything when he will come , I'll try to save as much knowing he is doing odd jobs and is struggling . 

I asked him to see a therapist and give a lot of reassurance over time ..

Also we had a lot of fights and fights and arguments . 

I always bring breakup twice a week in starting because of our family issues  but his dropping mental health and panic attacks make me stop ..

I did every single thing I could have done but it was never enough and when I say everything I meant it EVERY SINGLE THING . ( I don't mean sexually ) 
He said he tried too but he can't leave me accept or forget pr punish me for cheating . 

 Also I felt being interrogated over details of what that guy and I did etc every day for weeks or maybe months .

Then everything shifted 
DEC 2024 , 
He came to meet me during my exams, I clearly told no before he didn't listened . 
I missed one of my final exam a day ago due to my bad mental health and bcs I was careless and slept . 
He came on 18th . He would act crazy. I already wanted to break up . One moment it was good other moment it was worse . 

The same guy who cleaned my period blood off floor , walked bare foot with wounded feet in rain as my shoes broke . That guy who believed i made him a monster , who believed i made his mental health sick . 

He wanted to have unprotected sex while I wanted to wait until marriage but agreed reluctantly. I dont remember what it feel like 
 
But the next day when he asked again i pushed for condom ( the guy I slept with used condom so he don't wanted to ) 
I was scared , didn't want to create a scene and I don't know what to do , he guilt trip me and how I don't believe him . 

I was lying on the mattress , my face near the wall , he was doing it , I was feeling nothing , I asked him to stop 3 times bcs apparently my hand and knees were getting twisted and it was hurting . He didn't . 
On the fourth time he did . I don't remember much but i was crying while he was holding my wrists tightly shouting that he will get more mad if I cry .(  His eyes that day haunted me for a long time and I couldn't sleep or would flinch at every loud noise . ) 

Then he said he is so bad for making me tear up while I comforted him .
I had final exam next morning. I asked him to go back but suddenly he got sick and I had no option .we spent night at railway station cause he was out of money after he stayed for  10 days here . ( I had hostel with no boys allowed ) 
I made him to take medicines and he slept bcs of that . I cried the whole night and made internship report while sitting on a bench in cold night with blanket , hungry and few people sleeping at station . 
 It was worst ever . 

Next day he made everything ok I don't know how but he did then he left for home so did I . 
I was ok again but the nightmares were there . Also I asked him to break up , not bcs I hate him but bcs I could see our family won't agree
 ( I went home after 2-3 yrs so I thought before that they would have changed by now ) 

There is this thing , this guy claims to have another personality or something that make him forget everything he says or do in extreme anger . 

So with words that felt like knives he would lash out every day from past few months . 
Before that I felt I was toxic to him while he was the quiet green flag I have ever known . 

At home I get no privacy or time but he would constantly ask to talk and say he's going crazy and demanding  why I was bringing breakup up all jan.. he claimed I am cheating and that i have someone else in my mind . 
He said things that made my heart drop over chat and how he was sorry for that night but he couldn't stop bcs of the guy I slept with in 2022  before 
( I asked that guy from 2022 to stop while we were in bed and that I'm not sure for sex so he stopped but we did other things )  .

Ex Texted my best friend shitty things .
( Yet she stood for me like family but I had to leave her 😭alone later  ) 

Although me and my ex daily argue or he lash out but Once he said in extreme anger how he would kill my ex and the guy friend I made him jealous with etc . 
And when I got scared and told him it was wrong . He snapped how I'm choosing that guy over him , that how he wasn't really gonna do it but the threats felt so real his anger reminded me of his guardian .  ( It was in October 2024) 

My mental health was bad , I lost 10-12  kg of weight in past few months etc. 

He said he was sorry , don't want to do anything sexual but wanted to spent a night with me to  treat me like a princess . 

He pushed me to say yes to stay with him at night when he come to meet me but I rudely refuse so he started saying how i trust that guy slept with him but not my ex . 
..
I pretented to be loving him etc in last week of Dec bcs I was at home . Then I went no contact while he was worried and sent like 500 messages a day and calls to me , my friends etc  . I was so terrified . Had fever can't sleep or eat and flinch at every noise .

  After 3 days he showed up in my town and family got involved,

 I tried suicide but stopped , next thing i knew I was in police station and had to file FIR against him ..

Now it's a legal case , How he was threating to kill me over call if I breakup ( I didn't include sexual abuse ) . 
( He indeed told me  how his anger will.kill the guy I slept with , my guy friends . . And he said shitty things about my bestie ) .


His eyes felt as if I betrayed him . 

The case is still there , I don't even wanna continue and let it go . 

My life fell apart after all of this , my delayed graduation, loosing only 2 friends i have ( due to other reasons , if they weren't I would have killed myself ) . 

My family is supportive but back there in my hostel i didn't had family I had relatives in the town who handled the matter in worse way and got police involved.

But here I am back to my hometown ,  recently got a new job , life feels fast and I feel immature but better . 


The whole relationship was abuse 
I was toxic 
My mental health was bad and his was worse. 

I want no legal case or him to serve jail time .
He already spend one night in jail ( him getting bailed took time )  and said how he came this time just for last time and all .  His eyes scream how I am the one who betrayed him .
While his friend think I took money from him , I didn't . 

His family is very toxic to him so I felt so bad for him always and how his guardian throw away his childhood and make him drop out of school. 
Well he made me drop out of school too for more than a year . 

So AITA for wanting my ex to suffer ? 
Am I wrong for hating him ? 
I felt disgusted that he ever touched me while he said how i was almost a * and he is disgusted of me .


Old me hated all this and felt guilty but I feel how disgusting it was all and that how I wasn't the one responsible for all . 

But i did hurt people and how I don't make friends anymore , i stopped sh but sometimes I do it again when my sister told me how she is fed up of me crying so much . ( While I was crying after getting scolded by her over some careless thing I did ) 
How embarrassing it was for her to live with me ( her friends live here too ) 
How it feels like suicide to live with me . 
( Make me remember how my ex told me i made him monster ) 

Yup she is harsh with words but i know she love me , fight and take stand for me , supported all the way me through all of this . 
While she was the one I betrayed most by getting in this relationship as that guardian r* her for months .... I was 15 , she was 19  back then . 

TLDR : my ex and I fell in love without any commitment at 16 . His guardian r* my family member.. we got no contact . My ex and I reconnected after 4.5 yrs over call and get in relationship.  He was a victim too . 
I told him how I missed him and cried but also how I slept with other guy and go on dates etc , fueled his jealousy and compared him . I stopped but it got worse he said I cheated and etc . 
He got angry lash out over phone and later say I don't remember. ( Some personality thing) 
He would interrogate me over phone about details with the guy I slept with for hours  etc . And then he came to my city in dec 2024  ( we live in different states) 
And one night he sexually assaulted or r* me . 

Then when I wanted to break up next month he don't want too . 

Threats etc family got involved , legal case happen to be of how he gave death threats if I break up  over call . ( No sexual abuse) 
I never wanted to file a case so I won't be fighting it either . ( He won't serve any jail time either ) ..
I was toxic 
He was emotionally abusive .
He was obsessed with a idea of me that never existed and got mad when he met reality . ",1,1749901141.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

How I did this:

Basically I started to focus more on my opponents. 

Does someone suddenly drop Middle or Dora tiles during matches - they are most likely close to winning! If they didn't open their hand yet, no reason to panic. However, I try to not play into what they might need based on recent discards without folding. If they opened their hand or called riichi, I start to fold if my hand is not worth it or I don't see many dora tiles on the field. 

If I need to fold, I changed my tactic a bit. I especially look at their first discards (after the usual winds, dragons  & 1 + 9 tiles). If I see a 5 and a 3 of bamboo in the first and second row, it's often fair to assume, they did not work on a bamboo heavy hand. This gave me even more accuracy than using the typical suji method. 

And then of course the typical ""looking at opponents discards to assume what they might want to play"" type deal. 

It's fairly easy to spot potential flushes, half flushes, all triplets and all simples from the opponents pon and chi. 

Anything you recently changed that improved your game?

Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. Single, for those that care. My pic: [https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY](https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY)

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up! I'd love to meet a fellow demi-romantic purely because I never have. Where are my people?! It's absolutely okay if you're not though.

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love to read! I'm currently reading the 48 laws of power. It's completely psychotic but also fascinating; I enjoy all the history he sprinkles in with each law, as well. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. I'm currently playing No Man's Sky and Coromon.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

1lb6kgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1lb6kgw/spending_a_year_in_japan_on_a_whv_looking_for/,"Spending a Year in Japan on a WHV – Looking for Hidden Gems, Advice & Seasonal Tips","TL;DR:
I’m heading to Japan for a full year on a Working Holiday Visa. I’d love to experience the country as authentically as possible — so hit me with your uncommon tips, hidden gems, and seasonal must-dos. Also open to advice on travel, jobs, and life logistics.


Hey everyone!

This September, I’ll finally be wrapping up my architecture degree and flying to Japan for a year-long adventure. I’ve saved up some money and am using a Working Holiday Visa, which allows me to take on part-time jobs while I travel. My goal? To explore the country deeply, get inspired, meet people, and maybe even figure out what I want to do with my life.

I’ve been dreaming of this trip for years, so I’m now deep in planning mode — collecting recommendations, reading blogs, watching videos, and saving everything in a huge Excel sheet. I want to keep things flexible, but still have a loose framework.

I’ll likely post more specific questions in the coming weeks, but for now, here are some things I’m wondering about. If your answers depend on context (e.g., personality, interests, travel goals), feel free to ask — I’d love to share more about what I’m into. Thanks so much in advance!


Social Life & Community
	•	What’s the best way to meet people as a foreigner?
I’d love to connect with both locals and fellow travelers. Are language exchange meetups, hobby groups, or apps like Meetup or Bumble BFF worth it?


Fitness & Tattoos
	•	Are there gyms with flexible, short-term memberships?
I want to stay active but will be moving around, so ideally looking for places where I can drop in for a month at a time and then pause.
	•	How big of a deal are tattoos in gyms (or public places)?
I’ve got a couple of large thigh tattoos and smaller ones on my arms. I’ve heard mixed things — some say I should wear long sleeves and pretend I don’t have any. Is that really necessary?


Work & Money
	•	Do I need a Japanese bank account to work part-time?
I only speak basic Japanese. How difficult is it to open a bank account on my own?
	•	Any good sites or apps besides WorkAway for short gigs or internships?
I’m mainly looking for roles that offer accommodation in exchange for light work (1–2 months).
	•	Can I use my WHV to apply for internships in creative fields like design or architecture?


Seasonal Travel & Itineraries
	•	What are your favorite seasonal experiences — and where to have them?
I want to experience each season in a unique way:
	•	Winter: I’m thinking Hokkaido, but open to lesser-known alternatives.
	•	Spring/Fall: Any must-see regions for sakura or fall foliage that aren’t overrun by tourists?
	•	Summer: Planning to explore Okinawa or other islands. Hidden gems appreciated.


Accommodation
	•	Hostels vs Shared Housing?
I’ll mostly stay in hostels to keep costs low. But for longer city stays (like Tokyo/Osaka), I’m looking into shared housing options like Sakura House. Anyone got experience with that or other alternatives?
	•	Any underrated places to stay that offer a unique experience (like guesthouses, artist residencies, countryside homestays, etc.)?


Broader Asia Travel
	•	I’d love to visit Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan while I’m in Asia.
What’s the best travel route or order to do this in?
Are there any legal/political/logistical issues I should be aware of — especially between China/Hong Kong/Taiwan?


Life Logistics
	•	Best supermarkets that aren’t konbinis?
	•	Is it true that eating out is often cheaper than cooking?
	•	Is there anything I absolutely need to bring from Germany that’s hard to find in Japan?
(e.g., specific medicines, hygiene products, power adapters, etc.)


Holiday Tips
	•	Best way to spend Christmas and New Year’s Eve in Japan?
I know it’s more of a romantic holiday there — curious what solo travelers or small groups usually do.


For context (if it helps with recommendations):

I’m in my late 20s, just finishing my architecture degree. I’m into design (especially interior and furniture), photography, fashion, nature, sports, and coffee culture. I want to experience the country deeply, not just hop between tourist sites.


Really appreciate any help, advice, or even personal stories from those of you who’ve done something similar. Looking forward to learning from this community!",1,1749900822.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

I had a really long and tiring day. Sinalubong ako ni mama sa gate, after mag bless at kiss kay mama, takbo na ako agad kay papa.

""Sino yan?"" Tanong ni papa nung pumasok ako sa pinto.

""Papa, dito na ako"" sabi ko sabay tabi sa kanya at yakap ng mahigpit. Niyakap naman niya ako pabalik tapos hinahaplos niya buhok ko.

""Papa, kapoy na ako. Super"" sabi ko tapos iyak effect. As in super pagod ako, di na ako makalakad ng maayos dahil halos nakatayo ako buong araw.

""Wag ka mag alala, hindi ka na mapapagod dahil nasa bisig ka na ng daddy"" those were his exact same words.

Nag chichikahan lang kami about what happened to my day. Told him gagawan ko siya ng masarap na iced coffee bukas kasi nakapag uwi ako ng syrup from school. Pareho kaming mahilig sa iced coffee kaya nagkakasundo kami.

We had a pause after. I was just hugging my father.

""I love you papa"" i blurted all of a sudden. Never siyang humiwalay sa yakap ever since tumabi ako sa kanya.

""Mahal ka rin ni papa"" he said and keeps on kissing my head.

My dad is very vocal and touchy. Sa kanya ko namana yan. He loves to call everyone around him ""mahal"" dahil siya ang daddy/tatay ng lahat (81 na kasi siya). Ngayon, na adapt ko yan. It's either mahal or darling ang tawag ko sa lahat ng friends ko.

The food outlets got bought by the apartment company above the outlets and the bar I bartend at recently went through a rebranding and now they want to do the same with the coffee shop. I used to be a barista and used to also reach people at my current job about how to make espresso drinks. They offered for me to help with this rebranding. I don't have full reign, but as long as it gets approved then I will be coming up with the new menu, training and more. 

So my question is are there any flavors of coffees or tea, or methods of making them that interest you? Unique you don't see many places doing? Money is no object, it's a very fancy place that goes all out",1,1749900445.0,barista,1,0.67,False

My life with Liam Goldstein was a fairytale, a perfect love story plastered across every magazine and TV screen in Manhattan.  
He'd even unveiled the ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace, a multi-million-dollar cascade of sapphires, celebrating our perfect devotion.  
But fairytales are just that -- tales.  
Then came the burner phone, the hushed calls, the screenshots, and hotel receipts that screamed 'a\*\*air'.  
I watched him live-stream gifts to his young mi\*\*ress, Ava Sinclair, calling her his ""queen,"" only to later find her visibly pr\*\*nant in a hospital, flaunting our engagement necklace and talking about a ""situation"" with me.  
His friends, the same ones who toasted our ""perfect love,"" smirked as he publicly k\*ssed Ava and joked about his ""side action,"" assuring her I'd ""never find out.""  
Every grand gesture he'd made, from donating a kidney to cultivating a white rose garden, flashed before my eyes, revealing themselves as calculated performances.  
How could the man who saved my life, the one I vowed to, betray me with such grotesque audacity, in front of the world and his complicit inner circle?  
It felt like a sick cosmic joke, a public h\*miliation disguised as love.  
But I had given him a warning on our wedding day: ""If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish from your life as if I never existed.""  
Now, it was time to activate the Phoenix Initiative, erase Maya Goldstein, and leave Liam with nothing but ghost of a promise he had shattered.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Maya Evans dialed the number.  
  
It was a number she knew by heart, a lifeline to an ending.  
  
""Phoenix Initiative,"" a quiet, professional voice answered.  
  
""Client Nightingale,"" Maya said, her voice even.  
  
She stood by the large window of her Manhattan penthouse, looking down at the city that had been her stage.  
  
""We are prepared to activate upon your confirmation, Nightingale.""  
  
""Confirm,"" Maya said. ""Full protocol. Erase Maya Goldstein.""  
  
There was a pause, then, ""Understood. Activation in progress.""  
  
The call ended. Maya lowered the phone, a burner, and dropped it into a glass of water on the sleek, modern countertop.  
  
It was done. The first step.  
  
A news report played softly on the oversized television in the living area.  
  
Liam Goldstein, her husband, was on screen.  
  
He was at a charity gala, charming, handsome.  
  
The report replayed the moment from last week: Liam unveiling the ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace.  
  
A cascade of sapphires and diamonds, a multi-million dollar spectacle.  
  
The newscaster gushed, ""A testament to their perfect love, a love story for the ages.""  
  
Maya watched, a bitter taste in her mouth.  
  
Perfect love.  
  
If only they knew.  
  
The news segment continued, a montage of Liam's devotion.  
  
""Four years ago, Mr. Goldstein donated a kidney to his then-fiancée, Maya, saving her life.""  
  
Footage of Liam, looking weaker but smiling, beside a recovering Maya in a hospital bed.  
  
""He cultivated an award-winning white rose garden at their Hamptons estate, simply because white roses are her favorite.""  
  
A breathtaking shot of the sprawling garden.  
  
""And who can forget the privately published 'Book of Us,' a collection of their most cherished moments, a true romantic gesture.""  
  
Close-up of a beautifully bound book.  
  
Maya felt nothing watching it now, only a cold, hard knot in her stomach.  
  
The public saw a saint. She knew the devil.  
  
Her mind went back. Her parents' divorce.  
  
A public, ugly mess. Infidelity splashed across tabloids.  
  
It had made her terrified of commitment, of being fooled.  
  
Liam had pursued her for three long years.  
  
Relentless, charming, seemingly sincere.  
  
He learned she coveted a rare first-edition book.  
  
He found it at a high-stakes, underground auction.  
  
There was a scuffle, an accident. Liam was badly injured, almost died, all to get her that book.  
  
That grand, dangerous gesture. It had finally, foolishly, convinced her.  
  
He had proposed then, in the hospital, pale but triumphant, the book on his bedside table.  
  
She remembered her words, clear and precise, at their lavish wedding.  
  
A vow that was also a warning.  
  
She'd looked him in the eyes, her hand in his.  
  
""I can forgive many things, Liam,"" she'd said, her voice soft but firm in the silent church.  
  
""But not deceit. If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish from your life as if I never existed.""  
  
He had smiled, k\*ssed her hand, promised her eternal honesty.  
  
A promise he had shattered.  
  
Three months ago. That was when her world had cracked.  
  
Late nights Liam claimed were ""investor meetings.""  
  
Hushed phone calls he'd take on the balcony.  
  
A burner phone, hidden deep in his gym bag, discovered by chance.  
  
And then, the undeniable proof.  
  
Screenshots, messages, hotel receipts.  
  
An a\*\*air with Ava Sinclair, a young, ambitious influencer.  
  
Maya had felt the ground disappear beneath her.  
  
She had meticulously gathered more evidence, planned her exit.  
  
Yesterday, she signed the divorce papers.  
  
She placed them neatly inside the velvet-lined ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace box.  
  
The real necklace was probably still with him, or with Ava.  
  
Liam came home late, just as she finished with the Phoenix Initiative.  
  
He claimed it was a ""business trip to Chicago.""  
  
He looked tired, but his eyes held a familiar spark of excitement she now knew wasn't for her.  
  
Faint, almost invisible scratches, high on his neck, disappearing into his collar.  
  
He tried to kiss her. She turned her head slightly.  
  
""Long trip,"" he said, trying to sound casual.  
  
He pulled out the actual ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace. It glittered under the lights.  
  
""I had it cleaned,"" he said, his voice smooth. ""For our anniversary next week.""  
  
Liar. He'd probably been showing it off to Ava, letting her touch it.  
  
The thought made Maya feel sick.  
  
She picked up the identical, but empty, necklace box from the coffee table.  
  
The one with the divorce papers inside.  
  
""I have an early anniversary gift for you too, Liam,"" she said, her voice carefully neutral.  
  
She handed him the box.  
  
He looked surprised, then pleased. ""For me? You shouldn't have.""  
  
""Open it in two weeks,"" Maya said. ""On our actual anniversary. For maximum impact.""  
  
Liam, ever confident, ever oblivious, grinned. ""Mysterious. I like it.""  
  
He k\*ssed her forehead, then headed for the shower, humming.  
  
Maya watched him go. Two weeks.  
  
By then, Maya Goldstein would be a ghost.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Liam insisted on a ""make-up"" day.  
  
He said he felt distant, wanted to reconnect before their anniversary.  
  
He booked a VIP experience at Universal Studios.  
  
Over-the-top, expensive, and utterly meaningless to Maya now.  
  
He was incredibly attentive, holding her hand, buying her silly souvenirs she didn't want.  
  
Playing the part of the doting husband.  
  
It was a performance, and she was his unwilling audience.  
  
""I'm going to disappear, Liam,"" she thought, watching him laugh at some stunt show.  
  
""You just don't know it yet.""  
  
He pulled her close, nuzzling her neck. ""You're quiet today, beautiful.""  
  
""Just tired,"" she lied.  
  
His touch, once a comfort, now felt like a brand.  
  
He wanted her to stay, to be his perfect wife, his possession.  
  
The thought made her skin crawl.  
  
A young couple approached them, eyes wide with excitement.  
  
""Oh my god, you're Liam and Maya Goldstein, right?"" the girl gushed.  
  
""We're huge fans! Your love story is so inspiring.""  
  
They asked for a photo. Liam, ever the showman, beamed.  
  
He pulled Maya into a practiced embrace.  
  
""Smile, darling,"" he murmured.  
  
Maya forced a smile. She felt like a complete imposter, a fraud.  
  
The flash went off. Another perfect moment captured for a lie.  
  
The couple thanked them profusely, walking away chattering about ""relationship goals.""  
  
Maya wanted to scream.  
  
Liam was on his phone constantly.  
  
""Urgent work stuff, baby, sorry,"" he'd say, turning away.  
  
But Maya saw the screen reflection in his sunglasses once.  
  
Instagram. Ava Sinclair's profile.  
  
Later, while Liam was supposedly on a ""conference call,"" Maya excused herself.  
  
She ducked into a restroom and pulled out her own burner phone.  
  
Ava Sinclair was live-streaming.  
  
From Universal Studios.  
  
""My amazing boyfriend just gifted me this incredible VIP day!"" Ava cooed to her followers, panning her phone camera around a lavish private lounge.  
  
The same VIP lounge Maya and Liam had been in an hour ago.  
  
Ava boasted, ""And he just sent me a virtual castle on my stream! He's EmpireLover, best BF ever!""  
  
EmpireLover. Liam's not-so-secret online handle for his ""indiscretions.""  
  
Maya's stomach churned. The audacity.  
  
The virtual castle gift was a feature on the streaming platform, costing thousands.  
  
Ava's followers were going wild.  
  
""OMG, EmpireLover is loaded!""  
  
""He must really love you, Ava!""  
  
""Is he famous? Spill!""  
  
Then, a comment from EmpireLover himself, Liam, appeared on Ava's stream: ""Only the best for my queen. You deserve the world, Ava.""  
  
Publicly. For everyone to see.  
  
Maya felt a sharp, physical pain in her ch\*st.  
  
It was like watching him tear their life apart, piece by piece, and display it for sport.  
  
The betrayal was so blatant, so cruel.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Maya's heart hammered against her ribs.  
  
The pain was so intense, it felt like a physical blow.  
  
Liam returned, all smiles. ""Sorry about that, work crisis averted.""  
  
He put his arm around her. ""Feeling okay? You look a little pale.""  
  
Oblivious. Utterly, maddeningly oblivious.  
  
""Just a headache,"" Maya managed, pulling away slightly.  
  
She looked at him, at the man she had loved, the man who had saved her life, who was now destroying it.  
  
""Liam,"" she began, her voice low, ""if a man, a husband, was having an a\*\*air… what would you think of him?""  
  
He frowned, surprised by the question.  
  
""I'd think he was a sc\*\*bag,"" Liam said, his tone vehement. ""A real piece of tr\*\*h. Especially if he had a wife who loved him, who trusted him. There's no excuse for that kind of betrayal, Maya. None.""  
  
His hypocrisy was breathtaking.  
  
His phone buzzed again. He glanced at it, a flicker of annoyance, then something else -- concern?  
  
""D\*\*n it,"" he muttered. ""Another urgent company matter. Some new intern messed up big time. I have to go deal with it. Marc can't handle this one.""  
  
He k\*ssed her quickly. ""You stay, enjoy the park. I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.""  
  
He hurried off.  
  
Maya watched him go, a cold certainty settling in her.  
  
She pulled out her burner phone, dialed a car service.  
  
""Follow that black Escalade,"" she told the driver, pointing to Liam's departing car. ""Discreetly.""  
  
The Escalade didn't go towards Goldstein Global headquarters.  
  
It headed towards a sleek, new luxury condo building in a trendy downtown district.  
  
The driver parked across the street. Maya waited.  
  
Ten minutes later, Liam walked out of the building.  
  
With Ava Sinclair.  
  
Ava was laughing, clinging to his arm. Liam was smiling down at her, a look of possessive affection on his face.  
  
They stopped by his car in the building's private driveway.  
  
He pulled her close, and they k\*ssed.  
  
A long, p\*\*sionate, o\*en-m\*uthed k\*ss. In broad daylight.  
  
Maya watched, her bl\*\*d turning to ice.  
  
Then, they got into his car. The windows were tinted, but she saw the silhouette.  
  
The car began to rock, gently at first, then more suggestively.  
  
Right there. In the driveway.  
  
Maya closed her eyes.  
  
She remembered their wedding night.  
  
Liam had been so tender, so reverent.  
  
He'd told her he wanted their first time as husband and wife to be perfect, sacred.  
  
He had made love to her with such care, such devotion.  
  
It had felt like a true union of souls.  
  
Now, this.  
  
This cheap, sordid display in a car with his mi\*\*ress.  
  
The contrast was a knife twisting in her gut.  
  
The cab driver, a kind-faced older man, glanced at her in the rearview mirror.  
  
""Miss, are you alright?"" he asked gently.  
  
Maya opened her eyes. Tears were streaming down her face.  
  
""He's not worth it, miss,"" the driver said softly. ""No man who does that is worth your tears. You forgive him, you move on. Find someone better.""  
  
Maya shook her head, a bitter laugh escaping her. ""Forgive him? Never.""  
  
The grand gestures, the kidney, the roses, the book, ""Maya's Horizon.""  
  
All of it, a performance. A trap.  
  
She had warned him. ""If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish.""  
  
He hadn't believed her. He thought he could manage her, control her.  
  
He was about to find out how wrong he was.

We had coffees in the morning and just had left them in my car and forgot about them.

When we stopped for dinner one cup still had some liquid left in it and I didn’t want to put it on my dash of the car in case it fell over and spilt all over the dash.

There was a trolley left next to where we had parked so I thought I would put them in there and when we had finished with eating I will put them back in the cup holders and take them home to put them in the bin, due to there being no bins close by.

A car was parked behind us and saw what I was doing and then proceeded after they had finished eating to drive over, pick up the cups and drive off to a bin at a petrol station and then pretty much floor it past us.

After dieting, I had a binge week, once tasted something sweet I couldn't stop. 4-5k kcal on weekend, 3k kcal or more on weekdays got me extra 3kg in a few weeks. I want to get rid of that.

How to do 3-5 days fats, any tips on this for the first time? As I work from 7 to 17: 30 I drink 2-3 times coffee on my breaks and tea at evening, which helps supress hunger, I don't workout at the moment, so after work I try to keep myself busy somehow to not think about food.

>• First, make sure you actually understand what I'm saying (restate if complex)

>• Point out potential blind spots, flawed assumptions, or risks I might've missed

>• Ask 'what if' questions that challenge my thinking

>• Suggest alternatives when you spot issues

>• Stay grounded in reality - don't play along with ideas that disconnect from facts

>Match my energy and vibe level. For personal issues, keep it conversational - we're friends having coffee, not in a boardroom. For work-related questions, be professional. For serious stuff (health, safety, major life decisions), remind me you're an AI and suggest appropriate human help when needed.

Maybe I'm not as alone as I feel sometimes. It's easy to get wrapped up in my own little world, feeling like no one else could possibly get what I'm going through. But then I remembered, there are so many people out there feeling the same thing. 

Honestly, it was comforting in a way. It sort of shifted my perspective, knowing that even when I feel isolated, I'm sharing that same feeling with countless others. I guess it's a reminder that loneliness doesn't mean we're truly alone. We might all be in different places in life, but those waves of solitude connect us in a weird, almost beautiful way.

I’m David, a Godot developer with two years of experience, and I’m looking for a 3D artist to join our small, cozy team!

Right now, we’re just three:  
– I handle programming in Godot (2D or 3D)  
– One teammate focuses on 2D art (UI, icons, cozy design elements)  
– One handles music and SFX

We're setting out to create a **very small-scope, relaxing game** with the heartwarming vibe of:

🏙️ [Urban Jungle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2744010/Urban_Jungle/?l=french)

Our current concept?  
A **plant-filled tavern sim** — think a magical woodland café where you grow herbs and beans, brew coffee and potions, and serve charming forest creatures or hoomans. The gameplay would mix **light management**, **gardening**, and **cozy social vibes** in a low-poly, warm-toned world.

# 🎮 Core Concept:

You run a small, magical tavern nestled in a quiet forest clearing. The twist? All your ingredients—from coffee beans to healing herbs—are grown by you in a lush indoor greenhouse. Think of it as a cross between **Stardew Valley’s farming**, **Animal Crossing’s decor**, and a simplified **Coffee Talk** or **Dwarf Fortress tavern** feel.

# 🧩 Gameplay Loop (Simple & Satisfying):

1. **Morning Routine:**
   * Water your plants (coffee, herbs, decorative plants).
   * Harvest ripe ingredients.
   * Tend to magical potted plants (some may need music, shade, etc.).
2. **Tavern Open Hours:**
   * Greet cozy NPCs (forest folk, magical creatures, animals).
   * Brew coffee or herbal drinks based on their moods or requests.
   * Serve customers & earn coins, tips, and new seeds.
3. **Evening Management:**
   * Upgrade tavern furniture, lights, planters, or new drink machines.
   * Rearrange cozy decor or unlock new botanical displays.
   * Prepare tomorrow’s brew list (e.g. herbal coffee for insomnia, peppermint cider for fairies).

**Keep in mind that nothing is fixed, this is just some base idea, the goal is to gather a small team on discord and work around this or a subject for a small amount of time and try to get something out of it**

We don’t have a project in production yet — just ideas and enthusiasm. The goal is to **build something beautiful and doable**, with no crunch, no pressure. Just a creative space to make something meaningful and polished at a human pace.

If you’re a 3D artist who enjoys stylized worlds, nature vibes, or soft fantasy aesthetics, we’d love to hear from you. Even if you're just curious, shoot me a message and we’ll chat! I’ll share my Discord in DM so we can connect more easily. 🧡

Looking forward to hearing from you!

I’m a 28-year-old male-shaped entity hailing from that vibrant patch of Europe where people argue for sport, drink coffee like it’s a competitive event, and can hold a grudge longer than most international treaties.

By profession, I’m a.. let's say a programmer. I mostly just argue with machines until something works (or explode.. either is progress). I can’t hack into anything important, but I can make your app crash if that's what you want.

Outside of work, I’m a hobby hoarder. I dabble in:

- Hoarding books I will definitely read after one day.

- Gaming like I’m trying to speedrun social isolation. (recently started playing nightrein - if you play it too on steam pls carry me lol)

- Random artistic rabbit holes

- Cooking experiments that mostly end in fire alarms and philosophical reflection.

- Pretending I work out (I don’t... at least not effectively) and rewarding myself for standing up with snacks.

I speak several languages, which mostly means I mispronounce things internationally now. I also believe sleep is an optional DLC pack and time is a government conspiracy.

What am I looking for?

- Someone chill and human-adjacent

- People who enjoy voice chats and send cursed memes

- Dark humor survivors - someone who can match or appreciate dark, borderline concerning humor

- Individuals fluent in sarcasm, chaos, and the art of sending TikToks instead of forming real emotional connections

- Someone who hasn't slept properly since 2019

Bonus if you’ve ever cried over a movie, a dog video, or a badly timed game save. I know i didn't.

You don’t need to be perfect, just weird in a compatible way.

So if you're bored, curious, or just vibing, slide into my DMs. Worst-case scenario: we exchange weird memes and vanish into the night like digital cryptids. Best-case scenario: we become chaotic internet friends with questionable sleep schedules.

Management kept the air conditioning blasting to keep the servers from overheating. They reprimanded me last week for bringing a hoodie from home, as all clothing needed to have the HumanTech logo. I would have to purchase the jacket with company credits. I’d need to work overtime to make up for the lost income. Otherwise, I would lose my right to housing and have to go back to the Department of Labor Resources. 

If no jobs were available they’d throw me in prison for the worst kind of labor. People who went to prison never came out the same, if they ever came out at all. Most disappeared forever once they sank that low. I couldn’t fail at this. I had no choice but to move forward.

I paid another five credits for over-brewed coffee that looked like tar. Its heat melted the sides of the foam cup, bubbles breaking on the surface. I put a lid on the beverage and carefully walked over to my desk. 

I scanned my retina into the system, and the computer whirred as it sluggishly booted up. The screen loaded, starting a dozen applications, all of which took their sweet time to load.

“*Come the fuck on,*” I muttered under my breath, making sure my headset was off. A quiet rebellion, one of the last still allowed. The last thing I needed was HumanTech to dock my pay for profanity. The apps came to life, designed to keep track of my every move and breathe. Cameras swiveled everywhere, from this office to my spartan, company-approved living quarters. I grumbled under my breath. But it could be worse. I could do hard labor in a wellness camp instead.

Management made our desks stand only to fight obesity rates. A stationary stair climber waited under my desk like a threat. They required us to hit a minimum of 5,000 steps a day, or they would increase our health insurance premiums and deduct the amount from our credits. And they expected us to make these steps between calls.

My headset rang before my computer fully booted itself up. Static crackled on the line.

“Human Tech services, this is Karen speaking. How may I help you?” 

“Karen. You said your name is Karen?” an elderly voice chirped through static on the other side of the phone.

I rolled my eyes; I knew all the jokes surrounding my name, and I was not in the mood. My computer dinged. “Make sure you smile. We do not permit eye-rolling. Our members are important to us.” I forced a smile. “Make sure the smile reaches your eyes. We can always tell. Service with a smile, our customers can hear it.” I slammed on my mouse, minimizing the app.

“Yes, my name is Karen. This call is monitored for quality assurance. How can I help?”

“Thank you, Karen. I’m sorry I’m hard of hearing, but I need your help, please!” 

My stomach dropped as I heard desperation in the older woman’s voice.

“Certainly, I’ll see what I can do. But I need your name and file number.”

“I don’t know my file number, but I can give you my name. It’s Edith Meyer.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Meyer. I.. I’m going to need something more specific, a date of birth.”

“June 14, 1984. Please!”

I searched the system and breathed a sigh of relief to find only one Edith Meyer with that specific birthdate. Her file sat in front of me. It detailed her entire life. Every click, every search, every swipe of data stood before me.

“I have your file. How can I assist you?” I asked.

“My smart vehicle is out of control. I asked it to drive me to the grocery store, and it was going on its route, but then, before it turned on the correct street, all the doors locked, and it sped to an undisclosed location. Ma’am, I’m moving so fast, I’m scared. Help me.”

“What is the make and model of your vehicle?” I asked.

“What does this matter? 2055HumantechSUV Alto.”

My heart pounded against my ribs as I pulled up my troubleshooting manual. The page slowly loaded while my AI chirped at me for the long silence.

“Thank you for holding, Mrs. Meyer. Let’s walk through some troubleshooting steps,” I said, trying to hide the shaking in my voice.

“My car almost ran into someone on the highway!” A horn honked in the background.

“Did you try to switch it to manual-”

I gritted my teeth. The troubleshooting steps were asinine, and every minute in counted. It had already been five minutes, and that was too long.

“Karen, that’s the first thing I did. Can you remote in and stop this thing?”

“I wish I could, but we don’t have that ability.”

I submitted a suggestion for an override switch to the back office months ago, but they denied it as it would cause too much disruption to system efficiency. I wanted to scream.

Edith sobbed on the other end of the line.

“Have you tried turning the power off or hitting the emergency brake?”

“Yes, I’ve tried both and nothing.”

I frantically searched through the operator manual but found nothing to stop the runaway smart SUV. The call passed ten minutes. I’d get docked for hold time-but I couldn’t let her die.

“Ma’am, I’m going to need to put you on a brief hold,” I said.

“Please don’t leave me!”

“I can keep you on the line, but I need to reach out to the help desk. It might take a few minutes.”

Edith sobbed through the muzak. Fifteen minutes passed like a lifetime. I winced as I glared at the holdtime. 

“Hello, this is Brandon, with the help desk. How can I assist?” said a cold voice.

“Hi, it’s Karen. I have Mrs. Edith Myer on the line with me, and her 2055HumanTechSUV Alto is stuck in smart mode. It’s an emergency, and we need to remote in and stop the vehicle.”

“Oh. This is a common problem,” said Brandon, matter-of-factly. “Let me pull up her file.”

After a few more minutes of sobbing and hold music, Bandon picked up the line again. “So, Mrs. Meyer, HumanTech Industries has yet to receive paperwork that lists a caretaker since you’ve left employment.”

“What does that have to do with my car being out of control? I need you to help.”

“Mrs. Meyer, all Smart Vehicles take you to an Elder facility if the caretaker clause is not filed within one year. You are on your way to Lakeview retreat. You will receive the best of care there.”

A cold knot formed in my stomach. Lakeview was where HumanTech sent elderly people who could no longer work and had no one to care for them. No one ever saw them again.

“Lakeview?” asked Edith through tears. “I was a nurse at Lakeview before everything changed. When we all had freedom, that’s why they want to get rid of me. Because I still remember freedom.”

“Do you have any family and friends that can verbally stand in for your care?” asked Brandon.

“We can’t send her to Lakeview!” I yelled. My AI burning red, I would receive coaching on my tone, but it didn’t matter. I took a deep breath. “Edith, do you have any family members at all, any friends? Is there any way you can apply for work? Just something.”

“Karen, I need you to take a deep breath. Edith will receive wonderful care at Lakeview,” said Brandon, his voice unctuous with corporate speech.

“I don’t have anybody,” cried Edith. “I can’t work, and I’m nearly blind.”

“I’m so sorry. You will arrive at Lakeview within ninety minutes. There is no override.”

“You’re sending me there to DIE!” screamed Edith.

“This call is over. You’re no longer productive and we all die eventually.”

The line went dead, and a cold stone formed in my stomach. My chat box lit up with the name Brandon Foster.

1. Limit your water intake. Don’t drink more than necessary. If you really have IC drinking more water is not going to give you any benefits. Stick to 1-1,5l a day. This was also what my urologist told me. If drinking more water helps you then of course do that but don’t think you need to. Also drink little sips over the day and not a whole glass at once. 

2. Absolutely nothing else but still water. No tea, no coffee NOTHING! You are just irritating your bladder. 

3. Pelvic floor relaxation. There are many videos on YouTube. But generally if you are sitting and laying always make sure your legs are apart, relaxed and if you can, slightly „push“ your pelvic floor out.

4. Using ice packs or hot watter bottles on the pelvic floor and vaginal area. If it got really bad I just took and ice pack and put it between my legs and that definitely helped. 

5. Try to walk and stand as much as possible. Sitting or laying down will make it worse. 

6. Unless you immediately feel like it is helping don’t take Azo or Dmannose or anything. They are probably irritating your bladder more that doing anything.

7. Clean, Whole Foods, low acid diet. No lemon, chili or pepper even. You can also try a low histamine diet wich might help. For me it was the key to healing but it won’t help everyone of course.

8. Antihistamines. Not because they will necessarily reduce the urgency but they will knock you out like crazy. Hydroxyzine made me sleep like a brick for 14 hours but at the time this was better than being awake and tortured my my urgency. 

9. Cystoscopy with bladder stretching. This is a procedure you will have to do at the urologist and ideally under anesthesia. I do vividly remember that after I got my cystoscopy my frequency went down very noticeably for the first time. They did it to diagnose me and while doing so filled my bladder with water and that was probably the first time in months my bladder had more that 200 ml in it. I think they filled it with over 500 ml. 

Long term I got my frequency and urgency down by adjusting my diet and instillations. Those then helped me calm down and destress which obviously helped my bladder calm down even more. I hope this will help someone! ",3,1749898946.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,0.8,False

I just get very sad, I rarely get angry. Like very rarely. I've started to cry for the first time. Before I cried like maybe once in a year, now I've cried like three times in a month or something. What also happens is I get like paralysed. Today, after an argument I just lied on the ground, covered my eyes and pressed them, then ears. And I do deep breathing because first I get an anxiety attack. And then I just lie like that, eyes/ears covered, body tensed, in a fetal position. Now I feel so alone, unsafe and sad and it's very difficult to concentrate. My partner said he doesn't want to talk to me for a week and he won't respond to my texts (I said that I feel like he wants to hurt me on purpose).

**Bin chicken socks v magpie socks.** 

I asked Judge Vampira to pick a set of socks for me to wear. She chose the bin chickens. Judge Vampira may be biased, because her favourite bedtime story is about a bin chicken. But the judge's decision is final, and no correspondence will be entered into. Well she can't read or write yet, so there's no point. But she may be willing to engage in a little chomping.

**Bucketty v my Aunt Dot**

Auntie Dot learned about our mouse infestation, and arrived with her secret recipe home made mouse repelling spray (made from organic ingredients) and a heap of old Moccona coffee jars. 

Bucketty asked my Aunt Dot what was going on, and Aunt Dot has zero filters sometimes so she cheerfully answered: ""Just a little mouse problem. Don't worry dear, it will all be over in spring when the snakes wake up from hibernation."" 

Auntie Dot's opinion on Bucketty is that she is ""an odd bird, that one"". 

**The mice v nearly everyone**

Nearly everything in the pantry is sealed in plastic tubs, or jars, or tins. I love having an organised pantry, and I'm fighting down the urge to buy a label maker. 

The mice threw a tantrum once I threw out the chocolate they were eating, and at one stage I poked my head around the pantry door at 5 am and told them to keep the noise down. They also ate some of my beluga lentils (left the three other kinds of lentils, just ate the belugas), most of a packet of almond meal, and about half a packet of dehydrated peas. (I have no idea why there was a packet of dehydrated peas in the pantry.)

The chocolate has been replaced and is sealed inside a mouse-proof plastic tub; the korma paste has also been replaced and is sitting on a shelf out of elbowing range. When my son made his Indian shepherd's pie, I wasn't allowed in the kitchen for the safety of the korma paste. 

We have a huntsman spider in the house again. The Toy Boy is still nervous about spiders ogling his bare flesh. Telling him we should encourage the huntsmen because they sometimes catch mice did not reassure him like I'd hoped. 

Little Cat stepped up her harassment campaign against the meeses, and was regularly seen trying to bapbapbap them on their way as they ran for cover. Pennycat ignores them, because they don't come in tins with gravy. 

Leo, the cat from next door, has a presumed kill count of four. The last two have been left on the back door step, so he's probably trying to impress someone. Martin asked if he should be jealous, and if he needed to step up his dead mouse game and start bringing me mice.

When Ariana Collins rushed to the hospital after hearing that Luigi Maggiore had crashed his Maserati and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him.  
  
His friends urged her to go home and take a break, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.  
  
Turning around, she witnessed a nurse dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin!  
  
At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.  
  
""Jesus Christ, Ariana Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""  
  
Ariana froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.  
  
Luigi was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features—  
  
He didn't have a single scratch on him!  
  
Ariana blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.  
  
""Fellas, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Luigi's lacrosse teammate. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""  
  
""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another rich kid from Luigi's circle, ""we told her Luigi lost the Tiffany bracelet he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""  
  
""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Luigi's roommate, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Luigi was in a coma. She spent all night at St. Patrick's Cathedral lighting candles and sobbing to some priest. Got holy water and a blessed rosary. Luigi gave the water to my dog and gifted the rosary to Leila Brown the next day!""  
  
""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for plagiarism and nearly got her expelled. The way she begged the academic board—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""  
  
""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Luigi?""  
  
Luigi barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally ditch her after we hit ninety-nine.""  
  
""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that dance scholarship? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your dream girl and gets away with it.""  
  
""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Dating her just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""  
  
A deafening ringing filled Ariana's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.  
  
Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.  
  
The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Luigi was only dating her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.  
  
He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...  
  
Luigi Maggiore, Boston's unofficial prince. Student body president with a 4.0 GPA headed to Harvard Law. Heir to the Maggiore real estate empire. With his Mediterranean good looks, he could've stepped off a Calvin Klein billboard. ""One look at Luigi Maggiore and you're ruined for all other men""—that's what everyone said.  
  
And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.  
  
She had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her confession.  
  
She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.  
  
The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.  
  
He only agreed to date her later because she had beaten Leila Brown in that crucial dance competition and made his precious dream girl cry.  
  
For revenge, he pretended to love her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.  
  
Ariana's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.  
  
She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Luigi's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.  
  
She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.  
  
Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.  
  
Ariana spun around and fled.  
  
She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the hospital corridors, past startled nurses and visitors.  
  
She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Luigi, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.  
  
When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the hospital garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.  
  
She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.  
  
God, Ariana, you pathetic, gullible fool.  
  
After what seemed like hours, her phone vibrated in her pocket.  
  
With shaking hands, she answered to hear her mother's gentle voice.  
  
""Ariana, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to London next week. The Royal Academy of Music is eager for him to start the spring term. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They have excellent dance programs there too.""  
  
Her father, a celebrated violin professor at Juilliard, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Ariana had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Luigi. She'd even considered staying in Boston permanently, transferring to a local college just to be near him.  
  
Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any knife could.  
  
""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to London.""  
  


Chapter 2

Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the phone: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the paperwork right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""  
  
She gripped her phone tightly, fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""  
  
Her mother was about to hang up but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that boyfriend of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""  
  
The word ""boyfriend"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.  
  
Ariana's mind instantly flashed back to the hospital room—the cruel laughter, Luigi sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years dating her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Brown.  
  
Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.  
  
""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""  
  
After hanging up, Ariana stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.  
  
Ariana froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.  
  
This was Luigi's apartment—the one he'd casually tossed her a key to after finally acknowledging her feelings.  
  
That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna shack up?""  
  
Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their love story rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.  
  
She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future wedding in this very living room, picturing their children running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.  
  
Now those memories were like acid in her veins.  
  
Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.  
  
She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to live with her, to sleep with her night after night...  
  
All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.  
  
For the next three days, Ariana didn't so much as text Luigi at the hospital.  
  
She locked herself in the apartment and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.  
  
She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.  
  
""OMG saw Luigi in the library today!!! White button-down + those jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to read because I couldn't stop staring!""  
  
""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""  
  
""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Luigi Maggiore is dating ME. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""  
  
Ariana flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.  
  
She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.  
  
Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—  
  
The sterling silver tie clip she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition watch she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The designer jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.  
  
Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.  
  
Pictures of Luigi giving campaign speeches for student president, dominating the basketball court, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.  
  
She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.  
  
By the evening of the third day, Ariana had finally purged the last item.  
  
Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.  
  
Just then, the front door swung open and Luigi walked in.  
  
His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.  
  
Ariana looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""  
  
Luigi stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was in the fucking hospital after a serious accident. Where were you?""  
  
Ariana's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""  
  
Luigi froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""  
  
His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""  
  
Ariana pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.  
  
Luigi's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""  
  
Ariana's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""  
  
Luigi didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.  
  
The old Ariana had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.  
  
Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening accident, she hadn't even bothered to call.  
  
Luigi's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.  
  
His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My boys are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""  
  


Chapter 3

Before Ariana could refuse, Luigi had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Tesla.  
  
The car pulled up outside The Box, Manhattan's most exclusive members-only club. After parking, Luigi circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.  
  
Ariana gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.  
  
The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Ariana's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.  
  
Leila Brown.  
  
She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, Louboutins, and just enough diamonds to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.  
  
Leila had been Luigi's childhood friend. Though they had grown up together, during the years Ariana had dated Luigi, the two women had never crossed paths.  
  
So she'd never suspected that Luigi had been obsessed with Leila all along.  
  
When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk—a look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.  
  
This is revenge #97, Ariana realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.  
  
Luigi also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Ariana's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.  
  
He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with people or whatever. Back in five.""  
  
Ariana stood frozen, watching Luigi's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.  
  
Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Luigi's wake.  
  
Their silhouettes—one leading, one following—disappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.  
  
Ariana had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Luigi's friends quickly surrounded her.  
  
""Well, if it isn't Luigi's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.  
  
Ariana shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""  
  
""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Daddy Luigi will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.  
  
""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""  
  
Ariana tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""  
  
When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""  
  
""Ah—!""  
  
She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.  
  
The freezing water engulfed her instantly.  
  
She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.  
  
Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.  
  
...  
  
When Ariana next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Luigi's apartment. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.  
  
She struggled to focus her vision and saw Luigi sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.  
  
""You're burning up. Take these,"" Luigi said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern—if she didn't know better now.  
  
Ariana hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.  
  
Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.  
  
She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.  
  
Some time later—minutes or hours, she couldn't tell—she forced her eyes open again and realized Luigi was gone.  
  
Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.  
  
She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.  
  
She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.  
  
With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER.  
  
Ariana dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.  
  
The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.  
  
After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""  
  
Ariana leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""  
  
The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""  
  
Ariana pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Aspirin. My boyfriend gave it to me.""  
  
The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't aspirin at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""  
  
Ariana's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.  
  
She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.  
  
They were from a group chat with Luigi's friends.  
  
Tyler: Revenge #97 = EPIC WIN!!! ???  
  
Blake: Whoever came up with the pool + fake meds combo deserves a fucking medal! First we ""accidentally"" push her in, then Luigi swoops in with sugar pills ? She's gotta be DYING rn  
  
Josh: Luigi's face when she swallowed those pills tho ??  
  
Derek: HOLY SHIT DELETE THIS! WRONG GROUP! SHE CAN SEE THESE!!! ???

They remind me to breathe.  
To be present.  
To find peace in the pause.  
Because of that stillness?  
That solitude?

I had crippling social anxiety, terrible posture, I was a total mess, a people pleaser throughout my childhood, even in my twenties. I started to improve myself in high school, but I had slow progress, and I fell back many times...  

Now I feel like I am way better, I got a good job, I moved to the city I wanted to move to (I used to live in a small town, it has some pros, but I didn't like there as a young guy), I am way more comfortable in social situations, and my posture is better.

I am a quiet person; I enjoy spending time alone, exercising, visiting parks, nature, reading, and relaxing. I like people, but I need my alone time. 

I have an athletic build, a wide back, and I am handsome, though I look younger; people say I look more like 20-22.

**I never had a relationship; it just wasn't possible for me. I had such a bad foundation and mental health in the past.**

**But today, have my life together (not perfect, but at least I can work with this), I feel like I would have good chances of getting a date, a connection, a relationship, if I talked to more women. Or at least one :) Because I am talking to zero.** 

I know the mainstream advice of meeting is through hobbies, well, mine is exercising, with my body weight, in parks. I used to do boxing, but I don't enjoy it when someone tells me how to train. I like to do my own thing. I didn't see many women in street workout parks, and when I am there, I prefer to focus on the training anyway, and most people have earbuds, so this hobby is not a good way to meet women for me. 

Going to a park to read and relax, or a coffee shop when the weather is bad, I wouldn't call it a hobby, it's something I do sometimes. 

**Where can I go to enjoy my time, relax, and also have the option to meet people?**

1lb5rmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1lb5rmv/an_observation_on_medication_and_caffeine/,An observation on medication and caffeine consumption,"Despite the clear guidance NOT to consume caffeine whilst prescribed elvanse, I've somehow managed to go from having 'just the one' coffee in the morning to having 6 a day. I'm finally cutting it back, and here's what I've noticed in the last 10 days. 

For context, I've been on 40mg Elvanse for 2 years. Both myself and my prescriber know this is a suboptimal dose for my ADHD, however I could not deal with the elevated heart rate and blood pressure of higher doses... Which we will come to later. I had trialled 40mg Elvanse in the morning and then top up doses of immediate release dexamfetamine in the afternoon, and I'm going to ask for this again in my next annual review. 

Prior to being medicated, I would have about 7 instant coffees per day (two heaped teaspoons) and 1 barista coffee. My prescriber made it very clear I need to kick this habit - which I initially did.

Anyway, been taking the 40mg for two years and would still have my 1 coffee in the morning. Would still be a double teaspoon job because I'm a stickler for routine (AuDHD queen). Somehow over the years this has gradually built back up to having 7 cups of instant coffee per day and the odd barista coffee. This helped me to function at a level where I could do my job properly and actually felt motivated.

However my heart rate and blood pressure have not been enjoying this. I take my tablets around 6-8am and the combo of Elvanse plus several cups of coffee would mean that by 4pm I absolutely crash and burn. Id get daily tension headaches and have to go home to nap for a few hours before my dinner. 

About 10 days ago I finally told myself I need to pack it in. Naturally I'm still having the AM coffee, because... Yno. But I've switched my day time coffees to decaff or just herbal tea, and I've noticed something massive. 

I actually have more energy??? I'm getting home from a full day of work and wanting to do house work (albeit I'm not sure if this is because my meds have worn off by this point, and I'm back in my ADHD-must-do-everything-but-sit-still mode). But I'm not having the horrible tension headaches and needing to nap for hours. 

Most noticeably, I actually feel a sense of calm?? I feel like I finally understand what people talk about when they say that their meds help them feel calm and peaceful. Again, this isn't something that lasts all day, hence thinking I might need some top up doses in the afternoon. But from 8am - 2pm I am actually just feeling fine? I don't feel like I'm going to explode and I don't feel like my heart is racing out of my chest. 


I think there's a bit of a misconception that everyone with ADHD will fall asleep after having coffee. If I don't take my meds, coffee does bugger all for me apart from psychologically give me some motivation to complete a task after I've drank it. But caffeine does physiologically affect you, especially when taken with stimulant medication. And it's taken me two years to finally accept that!!

So if you're also illegally consuming caffeine alongside your meds and feeling mega out of whack, this could by why!",3,1749897818.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

Sheltered from thee cold wind at night on the side by the bedrock, it looks like a perfect spot.  
But!  
Be wary that in the desert, with no cloud in sight, there could be a storm far away.  
So far you can't see it.  
All water will then funnel down the riverbed in a flashflood.  
It is a sudden, instoppable force.  
Never, ever, sleep in a riverbed in the desert.

Whether it’s precious metals like gold, energy resources like oil, or agricultural products such as wheat, understanding the essentials of commodities trading can pave the way to financial success. In this beginner's guide, we’ll break down the basics to help you get started.

**What Are Commodities?**

Commodities are raw materials or primary goods that can be bought and sold. These products are typically categorized into two types: hard commodities and soft commodities. Hard commodities include natural resources like oil and gold, while soft commodities consist of agricultural products such as coffee, wheat, and livestock.

The prices of commodities are influenced by a variety of factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical events, weather conditions, and economic policies. These factors can make commodity prices volatile, presenting opportunities for traders.

**Why Trade Commodities?**

One of the main reasons traders invest in commodities is diversification. Commodities often move differently than stocks, offering an opportunity to hedge against inflation and reduce the risk in an investment portfolio. By adding commodities to your portfolio, you can protect your investments against stock market downturns.

Moreover, commodities provide opportunities for both short-term speculation and long-term investments. For instance, traders can use futures contracts to profit from price movements, while long-term investors can benefit from the growing demand for resources like oil, metals, and agricultural products.

**How to Get Started with Commodities Trading**

1. **Learn the Market**: To succeed in commodities trading, it’s essential to understand the market forces that drive price movements. This includes factors like global demand, supply chain disruptions, and weather patterns. Gaining insights into these elements will help you make better trading decisions.
2. **Choose Your Commodity**: With a wide range of commodities to choose from, it’s important to focus on those that align with your interests or areas where you see the most potential. Whether you’re interested in energy, metals, or agriculture, choosing a specific sector will help you build expertise.
3. **Use a Demo Account**: Many platforms offer demo accounts to practice trading without risking real money. It’s a great way to familiarize yourself with the process and test your strategies before committing real capital.
4. **Manage Your Risk**: Commodities markets can be highly volatile, so effective risk management is key. Setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your trades can help protect your investments from significant losses.

**Final Thoughts**

Commodities trading can be a lucrative and dynamic way to grow your wealth. While it involves a learning curve and requires a keen understanding of market dynamics, it offers significant potential for profits. As you gain experience and refine your strategies, consider exploring investment opportunities through firms like Manor life investments limited, which can guide you towards making informed decisions in the commodities market.",1,1749897612.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

# Receiving Stats

The receiving stats are now stored in a database like the passing stats. All tables have been changed accordingly. Thanks to a new backend, which I have developed for this purpose, it is now also very easy to import the updates for the players after a game. Anyone who wants to can do this, just get in touch with me.

Overview receiving stats: [https://elfpedia.eu/ELF\_Receiving\_Stats](https://elfpedia.eu/ELF_Receiving_Stats)

Example on a team page: [https://elfpedia.eu/Frankfurt\_Galaxy#Receiving](https://elfpedia.eu/Frankfurt_Galaxy#Receiving)

# New Tables

I have removed all the old, endlessly long tables of receiving and passing stats and replaced them with a completely new table layout.

We can do new things in these new tables:

* Search within these tables
* Change the displayed entries per page
* Display a total number of the filterd & total entries of the specific table
* Use pagination to browse

All this will be applied to all other stats sooner or later. Rushing, Special Teams, Defense etc are still a lot of work, but it will be done.

I also wish I had shown up in the smaller ways, listened to her and her needs and actually acted on them. Maybe I didn’t recognise at the time how important the small things were to her, to make her feel chosen and wanted. Planning dates, weekend getaways, activities on holidays, small gifts like flowers, coffee, breakfast in bed, more PDA. Choosing films she wanted to watch, cuddling in bed all day because she wanted to, nights out and just enjoying each others presence.

1lb5nj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dystopia/comments/1lb5nj3/this_call_is_monitored_for_quality_assurance/,This Call Is Monitored for Quality Assurance,"I stepped through the sliding doors into the freezing office of HumanTech, Inc.—a gray brick building with no windows and buzzing fluorescent lighting. 

Management kept the air conditioning blasting to keep the servers from overheating. They reprimanded me last week for bringing a hoodie from home, as all clothing needed to have the HumanTech logo. I would have to purchase the jacket with company credits. I’d need to work overtime to make up for the lost income. Otherwise, I would lose my right to housing and have to go back to the Department of Labor Resources. 

If no jobs were available they’d throw me in prison for the worst kind of labor. People who went to prison never came out the same, if they ever came out at all. Most disappeared forever once they sank that low. I couldn’t fail at this. I had no choice but to move forward.

I paid another five credits for over-brewed coffee that looked like tar. Its heat melted the sides of the foam cup, bubbles breaking on the surface. I put a lid on the beverage and carefully walked over to my desk. 

I scanned my retina into the system, and the computer whirred as it sluggishly booted up. The screen loaded, starting a dozen applications, all of which took their sweet time to load.

“*Come the fuck on,*” I muttered under my breath, making sure my headset was off. A quiet rebellion, one of the last still allowed. The last thing I needed was HumanTech to dock my pay for profanity. The apps came to life, designed to keep track of my every move and breathe. Cameras swiveled everywhere, from this office to my spartan, company-approved living quarters. I grumbled under my breath. But it could be worse. I could do hard labor in a wellness camp instead.

Management made our desks stand only to fight obesity rates. A stationary stair climber waited under my desk like a threat. They required us to hit a minimum of 5,000 steps a day, or they would increase our health insurance premiums and deduct the amount from our credits. And they expected us to make these steps between calls.

My headset rang before my computer fully booted itself up. Static crackled on the line.

“Human Tech services, this is Karen speaking. How may I help you?” 

“Karen. You said your name is Karen?” an elderly voice chirped through static on the other side of the phone.

I rolled my eyes; I knew all the jokes surrounding my name, and I was not in the mood. My computer dinged. “Make sure you smile. We do not permit eye-rolling. Our members are important to us.” I forced a smile. “Make sure the smile reaches your eyes. We can always tell. Service with a smile, our customers can hear it.” I slammed on my mouse, minimizing the app.

“Yes, my name is Karen. This call is monitored for quality assurance. How can I help?”

“Thank you, Karen. I’m sorry I’m hard of hearing, but I need your help, please!” 

My stomach dropped as I heard desperation in the older woman’s voice.

“Certainly, I’ll see what I can do. But I need your name and file number.”

“I don’t know my file number, but I can give you my name. It’s Edith Meyer.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Meyer. I.. I’m going to need something more specific, a date of birth.”

“June 14, 1984. Please!”

I searched the system and breathed a sigh of relief to find only one Edith Meyer with that specific birthdate. Her file sat in front of me. It detailed her entire life. Every click, every search, every swipe of data stood before me.

“I have your file. How can I assist you?” I asked.

“My smart vehicle is out of control. I asked it to drive me to the grocery store, and it was going on its route, but then, before it turned on the correct street, all the doors locked, and it sped to an undisclosed location. Ma’am, I’m moving so fast, I’m scared. Help me.”

“What is the make and model of your vehicle?” I asked.

“What does this matter? 2055HumantechSUV Alto.”

My heart pounded against my ribs as I pulled up my troubleshooting manual. The page slowly loaded while my AI chirped at me for the long silence.

“Thank you for holding, Mrs. Meyer. Let’s walk through some troubleshooting steps,” I said, trying to hide the shaking in my voice.

“My car almost ran into someone on the highway!” A horn honked in the background.

“Did you try to switch it to manual-”

I gritted my teeth. The troubleshooting steps were asinine, and every minute in counted. It had already been five minutes, and that was too long.

“Karen, that’s the first thing I did. Can you remote in and stop this thing?”

“I wish I could, but we don’t have that ability.”

I submitted a suggestion for an override switch to the back office months ago, but they denied it as it would cause too much disruption to system efficiency. I wanted to scream.

Edith sobbed on the other end of the line.

“Have you tried turning the power off or hitting the emergency brake?”

“Yes, I’ve tried both and nothing.”

I frantically searched through the operator manual but found nothing to stop the runaway smart SUV. The call passed ten minutes. I’d get docked for hold time-but I couldn’t let her die.

“Ma’am, I’m going to need to put you on a brief hold,” I said.

“Please don’t leave me!”

“I can keep you on the line, but I need to reach out to the help desk. It might take a few minutes.”

Edith sobbed through the muzak. Fifteen minutes passed like a lifetime. I winced as I glared at the holdtime. 

“Hello, this is Brandon, with the help desk. How can I assist?” said a cold voice.

“Hi, it’s Karen. I have Mrs. Edith Myer on the line with me, and her 2055HumanTechSUV Alto is stuck in smart mode. It’s an emergency, and we need to remote in and stop the vehicle.”

“Oh. This is a common problem,” said Brandon, matter-of-factly. “Let me pull up her file.”

After a few more minutes of sobbing and hold music, Bandon picked up the line again. “So, Mrs. Meyer, HumanTech Industries has yet to receive paperwork that lists a caretaker since you’ve left employment.”

“What does that have to do with my car being out of control? I need you to help.”

“Mrs. Meyer, all Smart Vehicles take you to an Elder facility if the caretaker clause is not filed within one year. You are on your way to Lakeview retreat. You will receive the best of care there.”

A cold knot formed in my stomach. Lakeview was where HumanTech sent elderly people who could no longer work and had no one to care for them. No one ever saw them again.

“Lakeview?” asked Edith through tears. “I was a nurse at Lakeview before everything changed. When we all had freedom, that’s why they want to get rid of me. Because I still remember freedom.”

“Do you have any family and friends that can verbally stand in for your care?” asked Brandon.

“We can’t send her to Lakeview!” I yelled. My AI burning red, I would receive coaching on my tone, but it didn’t matter. I took a deep breath. “Edith, do you have any family members at all, any friends? Is there any way you can apply for work? Just something.”

“Karen, I need you to take a deep breath. Edith will receive wonderful care at Lakeview,” said Brandon, his voice unctuous with corporate speech.

“I don’t have anybody,” cried Edith. “I can’t work, and I’m nearly blind.”

“I’m so sorry. You will arrive at Lakeview within ninety minutes. There is no override.”

“You’re sending me there to DIE!” screamed Edith.

“This call is over. You’re no longer productive and we all die eventually.”

The line went dead, and a cold stone formed in my stomach. My chat box lit up with the name Brandon Foster.

: PLEASE AVOID TRANSFERRING CALLS TO MY DEPARTMENT. THE EMOTIONAL OUTBURST WAS UNCALLED FOR AS WELL:

What would you say if that were your mother? I was trying to care for her.:

: Edith has already served her function. Lakeview will harvest her organs for reuse and provide her with a free cremation service.:

: You’re a sociopath.:

I’m also your supervisor. I need you to take five minutes to meditate and do what you need to do to serve your purpose. Otherwise, we can look into the reassignment of duties. :

I wanted flip my desk, scream, break something- but I swallowed it down. My phone beeped, and I thought of warmth as tears welled up but I smiled.

It's Saturday and my fiance was away for the morning, I woke up and did some cleaning, I drank some coffee did my Wordle and Connections, and then for the rest of the day I just sat in my bed not even on my phone literally staring at the wall. 

Even the reason I managed to clean today was because before it I stared at the wall for 40 minutes before. Kept repeating 'do something' to myself. When my fiance let me know he's 20 minutes away I got up and got on it. 

Now I'm done cleaning, have to take a shower and still stuck on the couch in an incredibly uncomfortable position, thinking just fuckin do something. 

I could nap, paint, read, take a bath, watch a movie, go for a walk, make a vision board as all components have been prepped for months, I literally have a craft cart full of paint, modeling paste, yarn, pencils and markers. My brain will not even let me get out of the uncomfortable position. 

I feel like.. when I think of any of those activities, all I can feel is empty inside, they don't provoke any emotion, even though I am an artist and it is my favorite thing in the world to paint. 

I guess I just needed to vent because this weekend will go by so fast and we'll be back to our low paying job at 7am on Monday. I just don't feel anything, I just feel (slightly) like I want to cry, but no tears fall. 

I just feel stuck and sad. And I know because of today, I will feel like this tomorrow also, because the last two weeks the only reason I didn't mind feeling like this is because I went camping and I work 12 hr days Monday-Friday and have no time to mind my feelings. 
It's like boredom overload, I just... every time I get like this I have a feeling this will last forever and I will not enjoy anything anymore for all my life.

I’m flying into **Kochi** soon to attend a close friend’s wedding in **Guruvayur**, and I really want to rent a **Mahindra Thar** for the trip — something about cruising Kerala roads in a Thar just hits different! 😄

I’ve already explored all the online rental platforms, but they seem quite expensive or have inconvenient terms. So I don’t have any contacts in Kochi who could help me—hoping someone here can point me toward:

* Trusted self-drive Thar rental options in or near Kochi (ideally more affordable than the big platforms)
* Individual owners or local vendors who regularly rent out Thars
* What kind of documents/deposit are usually required?
* Any tips on negotiating price or avoiding hidden fees

The plan is to pick it up in Kochi, drive to Guruvayur for a few days, then return it in Kochi. I can be flexible on pickup/drop-off location or timing.

Would truly appreciate any leads or suggestions 🙏

1lb5j36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lb5j36/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_stepmother/,AITA for calling the police on my stepmother?,"
This incident occurred about a year ago now, but I still regret it. I, (18F) reported my stepmother (43F) to the police when she threw hot coffee on my sister (15F), then 14yo. 
My parents divorced when I was >5yo, and my dad quickly met a new woman (let's call her Susan) and married her in 2018. They have a son, my half brother (9M) and she brought a kid from her previous marriage as well, my stepbrother (13M). 
In the beginning, Susan was fine. Adjusting to moving in with a guy she had only just met, meeting my sister and I, and adapting to shipping myself, sister and stepbrother to our other parents - who both lived over an hour away from her house. 
Once my dad and her moved closer to my mum, my school, and his work (everyone always has to move for dad's work) they began to rent a house. 
I won't go into the nitty gritty, but she is terrible. She yells at my sister and I, swears at us and dad, throws things, repeatedly tells us how she wishes my dad never met my mother, and tells my sister And I how bad a person my mum is.
Disclaimer: my dad is not perfect. The same yelling and swearing he received is always reciprocated. I believe they would both be happier alone, although I also think every relationship they would have found would end up with their behaviour repeating.
I'll give you a brief list of the thibgs Susan has done over the years:
• sworn at my sis and i
• burnt a picture of my mother infront of us
• thrown containers and crockery at my sister
• looked down my sister's shirt when she saw that she had started wearing training bras (and yelled at her about it)
• pushed my sister
• slammed the door of our room so hard a picture fall on the floor and shattered
• left my sister and I at home for upwards of 2 days alone, while my dad was away, with no note to tell us what to eat or when she would be back (we were 9 and 7)
• driven away before my sister could properly get out of the car when dropping us at our Mum's house, making her jump to get out *she sprained her ankle so badly she couldn't walk)

There are more, but most of them repeat themselves. 

It's been nearly 12 years of this. I was already planning to move out ASAP, and will do so in October this year. But it wasn't really me that she targeted- it was always my sister. 
I'll out it bluntly, I'm the tougher of us. Especially when we were kids. I was a hard core tomboy, took martial arts lessons in school, was more mature (eldest sister syndrome) and didn't learn to hold my tongue until 13ish. 
My sister was not this. She is sweet and gentle, was willing to see the best in people, and trusted everyone. She was the easy target.
She has changed since then. She's become a lot more pessimistic, talks back more, and flips Susan off daily (behind her back).

Last year, when I was 17 l, and my sister was 14, Susan was yelling at us about not taking out the bins. She made some snarky comment and my sister muttered back something. 

Instead of walking away or telling her to mind her tongue, Susan took the coffee she had just made  and threw it on my sister. 

She uses instant so it was 90% water. My sister was wearing a windproof jacket at the time, so her back was mostly saved, although it seeped through the fabric quickly. But thd back of her neck, over her ears, the sides of her face, and her hands (shs had lifted them to take out the bin bag) were covered in the boiling coffee. 

I started screaming at Susan, because I was furious. My sister took off her jacket and was wiping the coffee off her, but her skin was red. 
Susan didn't take her to a hospital because she didn't think it was ""bad enough"". 
She started apologising, but neither of us listened to her. She cleaned my sister's jacket and gave it back to her before she left for school (it was her uniform) and helped her to clean up. 
That night she apologised again, and gave my sister a hug. I didn't let her hug me - my anger had simmered all day while at school and had reached its limit. 
I started thinking about all the things Susan had done over the years, how nothing ever changed, how my dad never did anything meaningful to help, and how my sister, at 14, had no legal ability to do anything. 
I'm not a trusting person. I listen to far too much true crime, have seen too much bad in this world, and known too many backstabbing people to trust freely. You have to earn it, and once lost, it is gone forver. Due to my fascination with crime though, I trust the police. They were the power of the law, and capable of helping.
Side note: teachers in Australia have a duty of care for their students. If they hear or see something that is concerning, they HAVE to report it. My sister had see the school counsellor multiple times, and nothing had happened. So I couldn't go there. I also didn't want to embarrass her infront of her friends.
So I made a report to the police and told them thr whole story I just wrote down above. As soon as I pressed the 'submit button, I regretted it. I realised that Susan - who is Russian - would be looked at differently. I thought of her two kids, and realised that if this went too fat, she could lose custody of them. As much as I hate her, I don't want to take my brothers' mum away from them.
But the police  actually listened to me.
They opened an  investigation, spoke to my family, sister, teachers and everyone. 
Susan was furious, and blamed my sister for it. She denied it, but Susan was still angry.
Susan and dad hid it from me, so did Mt mum, who was notified. 
I still haven't told anyone about it - only my best friend, who wouldn't tell anyone.

The whole thing scared Susan, and she hasn't been too bad since. I think she realised that my sister And I don't forget, and that her actions may have consequences.
But I also scared my sister and brothers. My sister hadn't ever spoken to police before, and now the teachers at our school know something is going on. My brothers thought their mum was going to jail, and my dad (who works for the government) was badly impacted by it.
My sister blamed her best friend for telling the police - she was the only one my sister told. They stopped being friends after that, which still eats me alive.

AITA for doing this? I really scared my whole family, but I also don't regret it. Susan had been nothing but hell for my sister, and I won't forgive her. But I can't help thinking that there were alternatives to the police?
I also feel guilty about not telling anyone. But I'm so scared of what they would say. Please tell me what I should do!

The day after we finished dividing up the assets from our divorce, I got into a car accident and lost my memory.  
  
Later, my ex-husband River Kane tracked me down. He said if I stopped acting crazy all the time, maybe we could get remarried.  
  
I was mid-bite on my ice cream spoon and just froze. After a long pause, I finally managed: ""Uh, no thanks! I mean... I... I'm actually totally fine just keeping the money.""  
  
...  
  
I woke up to find my best friend Mackenzie staring at me with this super worried expression plastered all over her face.  
  
""Hey, don't beat yourself up anymore, okay?"" she said, trying to sound all reassuring.  
  
""Look, your body is your temple, babe. Even if you're going through this divorce mess, you still gotta live your best life.""  
  
She sat down on the edge of my bed, fidgeting with her phone. ""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end.""  
  
I just stared at her, my brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton. After what felt like forever, I finally managed to get the words out. ""Um... who the hell is River?""  
  
Mackenzie froze mid-sentence, looking at me like I'd just spoken in tongues. It took her a hot minute to snap out of it before she bolted to get the doctor.  
  
The doctor said I had memory loss from the car accident. Mackenzie immediately jumped in, asking how old I thought I was.  
  
I said without any hesitation. ""Eighteen. Didn't I just finish my SATs yesterday?""  
  
Mackenzie completely lost it. She literally crumpled to the floor, laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach and pounding the side of my hospital bed with her fist.  
  
""Willa, oh my GOD! This amnesia thing is like... the universe giving you the ultimate do-over! Yes! You're eighteen, baby! Eighteen and free! No River, no kid, no drama... just you and me against the world!""  
  
Now I was even more confused than before.  
  
Mackenzie took me back to her place once the doctors confirmed my memory probably wasn't coming back anytime soon.  
  
That's when she finally gave me the rundown on my apparently very messy life.  
  
Me—Willa Reynolds—fell head over heels for some broke college guy named River during freshman year.  
  
I spent ten whole years with this dude, from eighteen to twenty-eight. Stuck by him while he was building his empire from nothing, lived off ramen and dreams, popped out two kids for him, and basically became his family's live-in caretaker.  
  
And this year? He decided to divorce my ass.  
  
""Wait, WHAT?"" I practically shrieked.  
  
This sounded like some tragic Lifetime movie bullshit.  
  
After I got over the initial shock, I asked in this shaky voice, ""So you're telling me I spent a decade being someone's unpaid servant, and then got kicked to the curb at twenty-eight?""  
  
Mackenzie nodded grimly. ""Yep. And you've got two kids—your son's six, your daughter's four. But since you were a stay-at-home mom with zero income, and the kids chose to stay with daddy, River got full custody.""  
  
""Hold up... so I lost the kids I spent years raising too?""  
  
Even though I couldn't remember any of this, it sounded absolutely terrifying. I was about to start ugly crying.  
  
Then Mackenzie's whole vibe shifted, and she actually smiled while patting my shoulder. ""Hey, don't look so miserable. At least you're loaded now.""  
  
I blinked back tears and asked cautiously, ""How loaded are we talking?""  
  
Mackenzie sat up straight, looking way too pleased with herself. ""Willa, listen carefully. You walked away with twenty percent of River's assets, ten percent stakes in three publicly traded companies, and two historic townhouses in Manhattan. We're talking about nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Dead silence.  
  
I stared at her, then asked slowly, ""Mackenzie... you're not messing with me, right?""  
  
""If I'm lying, I'm literally a piece of shit.""  
  
That day, I spent hours just staring out the window at the sky.  
  
I'd lost ten years of memories. I had no clue what my life had been like during that time.  
  
But Mackenzie said I was rich as hell, and eighteen-year-old me had always been obsessed with money.  
  
So honestly? I guess this isn't too bad.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Mackenzie took time off work to help me sort through endless paperwork and property transfers.  
  
I never actually met this River guy—he had his lawyers handle everything in the divorce settlement.  
  
After nearly a month of bureaucratic hell, Mackenzie helped me list all my properties as rentals.  
  
She did the math and told me I'd be pulling in about one-twenty thousand a month just in rent.  
  
That day, staring at my bank account with more zeros than I could count, I looked up at the mirror. The reflection showed a perfectly put-together twenty-eight-year-old version of myself.  
  
I scratched my head. Wow. Not bad at all.  
  
I had nothing but time on my hands while Mackenzie went back to work, so I basically lived at her place playing video games all day.  
  
She'd order food for both of us during lunch breaks.  
  
Mackenzie worked insane hours and would come home looking like death warmed over, collapsing on the couch like a zombie.  
  
I'd put down my controller and give her shoulder rubs. Apparently muscle memory was still intact because I was surprisingly good at it.  
  
Once she'd recovered enough to form sentences, she'd start ranting: ""River is such a piece of shit. Right after you graduated, you were basically his unpaid intern. And when his mom got sick, you'd come home from work just to give her massages and take care of her.""  
  
Mackenzie kept going, then suddenly grabbed my head and flicked my forehead. ""Willa, you were such a pushover! The second I wasn't around, you let them walk all over you. That whole family treated you like garbage because they knew you didn't have anyone else.""  
  
I rubbed my forehead, feeling genuinely hurt. ""Hey, I don't remember any of that stuff! All I remember is you.""  
  
Mackenzie stopped mid-rant, then broke into a huge grin. ""You're right! You don't remember, and that's perfect. Just remember me—I'd never treat you like that.""  
  
I believed her completely, because Mackenzie and I grew up together.  
  
We were both foster kids.  
  
When we were little, I basically followed Mackenzie around everywhere. She'd fight other kids for snacks and help me with laundry.  
  
As we got older, she'd help me with homework. She was a year ahead of me, so when I was a senior, she was already in college, calling me every single day to keep me motivated.  
  
She wanted us to go to the same university, but Mackenzie was way too smart. Even when I studied my ass off, I couldn't get into Harvard like she did.  
  
The day our test scores came out, I just hugged her and cried.  
  
Mackenzie flicked my forehead again. ""What are you crying for? You got a 1480 on your SATs—that's amazing!""  
  
She ruffled my hair. ""You did great.""  
  
I ended up crying all the way to Boston for college.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Talking about it just made Mackenzie feel guilty all over again. ""I never should've let you go to Boston in the first place. If you hadn't gone to Boston, you never would've met River. If you'd never met River...""  
  
I jumped in with the obvious answer: ""Then I wouldn't have nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mackenzie put her hands on her hips. ""What's more important—the money or those ten years of your life?""  
  
I tried to guess the right answer: ""The money?""  
  
Mackenzie looked like she wanted to shake some sense into me. ""YOU'RE what's important! If you're miserable, all that money is worthless. Thank God you lost your memory, because if you remembered everything and did something stupid to yourself, what good would any of that money do?""  
  
""Well... it could buy me a really nice headstone...""  
  
Mackenzie cracked up despite herself. ""Oh my God, shut UP!""  
  
Mackenzie had always been incredible, and she still was. She was now a VP at some multinational corporation, pulling in around forty grand a month.  
  
But she was constantly swamped with work and business trips, and she worried about leaving me alone.  
  
So she started dragging me along everywhere. Eventually she figured if she had to babysit me anyway, why not put me to work?  
  
She got me hired as her assistant at her company.  
  
I was so ready for this! I'd spent months reading like fifteen different romance novels about powerful bosses falling for their assistants.  
  
On my first day, I strutted in wearing this killer business dress, feeling like I could take on the world.  
  
I made her coffee, organized her files, ran around doing errands.  
  
I was trying so hard to impress her that she finally started laughing and told me to chill. She handed me a spreadsheet and said, ""Have Ava show you the ropes on this. Take your time learning—no rush.""  
  
""Got it!""  
  
And just like that, I officially entered the workforce.  
  
I started following Mackenzie's schedule, but since I didn't have much on my plate, I usually got off work way earlier than her.  
  
Mackenzie, on the other hand, was buried in work. I'd hang out in the break room waiting for her to finish up every night.  
  
One day, Mackenzie caught me watching online tutorials on my phone and suddenly got serious. ""Willa, do you actually want to learn this stuff for real?""  
  
""Yeah... I really do.""  
  
With the memory loss, I was basically starting from zero at work. I kept screwing things up and it was getting pretty depressing.  
  
Mackenzie had always been my role model growing up, and that hadn't changed. I wanted to be as effortlessly competent as she was. She made everything look so easy and cool.  
  
So Mackenzie enrolled me in classes. After work every day, I'd drive to night school.  
  
I took project management courses mixed with software training programs.  
  
I filled up two entire notebooks before things finally started clicking. Oh, that's how it works!  
  
When I finished that program, Mackenzie signed me up for accounting and finance classes.  
  
After a full year of studying, I finally had my lightbulb moment.  
  
Everything made sense now, and work started feeling natural.

1lb5gna,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lb5gna/not_getting_the_right_does_bambino_plus_with/,Not getting the right does [Bambino Plus with Baratza Esp],"Hi all,

I just bought my very first espresso machine. I got it second hand from ebay from a shop that sells refurbished machines with a year warranty. 

I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong or if the machine is problematic. After watching loads of videos online, it seems like the average dose and grind size is 18g of beans, grind at setting 18, and produce a yield of 36g of espresso within 28-32 seconds. 

My problem is that at grid size 18 i can barely get 14g of coffee out and that's in 30s. I can grind at setting 20, which is the most coarse it gets for espresso and get more coffee out, but i feel like that defeats the purpose of buying a grinder and test different grind sizes and beans. I might as well buy ground coffee. The beans I'm using are called Allpress Brazil Scabavachi Espresso.

Any advice will be highly appreciated before i try to send it back to the shop.

Thanks in advance!",1,1749896594.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
