Not only do I get to avoid the daily commute, but I've also discovered a sense of freedom and flexibility that I never thought possible. Here are six real benefits of remote work that I think are worth sharing – and one bonus that might just surprise you.  


**1. My Day, My Rules**

One of the best things about remote work is being able to create my own schedule. I'm not a morning person, so I don't have to pretend to be one just to fit in with the office crowd. I can work at 10 am, 2 pm, or 5 am – whenever I feel most productive. And with no commute to worry about, I can take breaks whenever I need to.

**2. Time and Sanity Restored**

Let's face it: commuting can be a real drag. Traffic, crowded trains, and long hours spent sitting can take a toll on our mental and physical health. By working from home, I've saved hours of my day that I can now use for more enjoyable activities – like taking a walk, practicing yoga, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee in peace.

**3. Home Sweet Office**

My workspace is my happy place. I can wear whatever I want, cook my favorite meals, and even have my furry friends by my side. It's amazing how much of a difference a comfortable workspace can make in terms of focus and productivity. Plus, I no longer have to deal with awkward office chair ergonomics or awkward small talk with coworkers.

**4. Autonomy and Creativity**

When I'm working remotely, I feel like I have more ownership over my projects. I can take the time I need to research, brainstorm, and experiment without being micromanaged. This freedom has allowed me to develop my skills, try new things, and even come up with innovative solutions to problems.

**5. A World of Opportunities**

Remote work has opened doors to new possibilities for me. I can work with clients and companies from all over the world, which has broadened my perspectives and introduced me to fascinating people and projects. Plus, with the rise of remote work, I've noticed that many companies are now more open to hiring people from diverse backgrounds and locations.

**6. Work-Life Balance, Redefined**

When I'm working from home, I can seamlessly integrate my work and personal life. I can take care of errands, attend to family obligations, or simply enjoy a quiet cup of coffee in the morning without feeling guilty. It's amazing how much more productive and fulfilled I feel when I can take control of my [work-life balance](https://wiredtoremote.com/how-do-you-maintain-work-life-balance-while-working-remotely).

*And A Bonus Point?*

**You'll Discover Who You Are Outside of Work**

When I'm not stuck in traffic or dealing with office politics, I have the space to explore my passions and interests. I've started painting again, reading more, and even learning a new language. Remote work has given me the freedom to be me – outside of work, at least. It's been a journey of self-discovery, and I'm grateful for it.",1,1754295590.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

sometimes, and only sometimes, i’m deemed to never trust a fart; having moved my pony to a new yard with only a single plastic porta loo i began feeling such anxiety that i took Imodium daily like it was cr*ck; i’m sorry, but the visions of gassing out this plastic tardis made it worth it

until never trusting a fart became farting endlessly with a truck load of shite trapped in my
colon

i’m telling you, i feel and look 7 months pregnant

i came home from stabling my pony last night and ate my weight in malted wheat, topped with 2 bananas. i was certain that this was going to get things moving since it’d been around 48 hours since i last abused imodium (a heart to heart with my friend concluded with, “once you sh!t in that porta loo once, you’ll never be scared again” i had to reverse the poop chain and fast)

this didn’t work

knowing grapes are a trigger, i ate several of them from the fridge like a hungry rat at 4am

Tapering Prozac 10mg


Hi everyone,

I’ve been on 10mg of Prozac daily for several years. Aside from a one-month increase to 20mg in December 2022 (which I then tapered back down from), things were relatively stable. I would occasionally miss a day here or there without major issues.

But in June 2023, something strange happened. I walked past someone smoking weed and got a strong secondhand whiff. From that point I felt that I got a second hand high. The next day, I felt sedated and noticed the world looked strangely “video game-like.” That was the beginning of a nightmare.

Since then, I’ve had:
	•	Shortness of breath
	•	Random panic
	•	And most disturbingly: intense food sensitivities and digestive issues

I started reacting to things like Coke, baked goods, coffee—foods I used to tolerate fine. Even a sip of soda would bring on panic, detachment, and other weird sensations. I took a sip of coke and woke up in the night with heart beating through my chest and hot flash all over my head and I was running back and forth thinking I need to go to the ER.

I lost a lot of weight because eating started triggering symptoms.

I suspected serotonin syndrome and spoke to my doctor. We agreed to taper. I began in November 2023 with a 2-days-on, 1-day-off pattern. That led to new reactions—rage, dissociation, body-wide discomfort—especially after foods like bagels and cream cheese.

After several months, I transitioned to 1-day-on, 1-day-off, then to 2-days-off, 1-day-on. During the taper, I developed severe trouble swallowing and couldn’t eat or drink. I did every test imaginable—nothing conclusive.

I reverted to 1-day-on, 1-day-off, and with time my swallowing also slowly improved. I also began taking a PPI for stomach discomfort. Things were stabilizing until my therapist pressured me to return to the full 10mg dose.

Against my instincts, I caved. Within days:
	•	Vivid, intense dreams
	•	Panic surges throughout my body
	•	Severe food reactions (even plain rice made the world feel like it was tilting — maybe vertigo?)
	•	Heart palpitations
	•	Cognitive decline: racing thoughts, inability to focus, drugged feeling

I dropped back to the 1-day-on, 1-day-off schedule again. Some symptoms improved, but the food issues, vivid dreams, and cognitive impairment remain. My stomach still burns after certain foods. I feel my brains always chattering, and unable to think clearly.

I’ve tried asking my doctor, but they’re no help. I feel like I’m stuck in some kind of withdrawal or kindling loop and have no idea how to escape. I’m scared I’ve done long-term damage.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Am I going through kindling? Is there any way out?

Any advice or shared experience would mean the world. I feel really lost.",1,1754294774.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**All-Purpose Concentrate:** ‌The Branch Basics All-Purpose Concentrate ⁢serves as ​the primary cleaning agent. Composed of ingredients⁣ like⁤ chamomile, coco glucoside, and sodium citrate, this concentrate is biodegradable and ​free from harsh chemicals, fragrances, and dyes.Its key ‍function in ‍the ‍dishwasher ​is‌ to cut through grease and grime, leaving ⁤dishes‌ clean ‌without any harmful residues.‌ The concentration allows for customization of ⁢the cleaning power depending on the level of soiling of the dishes, and the type of‍ dishwasher being used.

Branch Basics recommends starting with a‌ small amount of concentrate⁣ to test compatibility and adjust as needed.

**Multi-Purpose functionality:** Beyond⁣ dishwashing, the Branch Basics Concentrate and Oxygen ‌Boost can also be used for pre-treating heavily soiled dishes, ⁤cleaning the dishwasher itself, and as a general‌ surface cleaner​ for the kitchen. This versatility minimizes the need for multiple specialized cleaning products, simplifying the⁣ buying⁢ needs of the consumer.

**Eco-Friendly Packaging:** Branch Basics emphasizes its commitment to sustainability with its packaging. The concentrates are available ‍in reusable bottles which helps ⁢reduce plastic waste. Additionally, the company offers subscription services ⁤that further‍ encourage continuous reuse. The materials are carefully‌ checked to⁤ minimize environmental​ impact.

For families with children, pets, or⁢ sensitivities, this can provide significant peace of ⁤mind.

**Environmentally Friendly Cleaning:** ⁣Branch Basics' biodegradable formulas are‌ designed to minimize environmental impact.By avoiding harsh‍ chemicals, the ‌products‌ reduce ⁣the risk of water pollution and harm to aquatic life. Also, the reusable packaging options contribute⁣ to ​a lower carbon footprint by reducing plastic waste.

**Gentle on Dishes:** The ‍gentle ⁢nature of Branch Basics' ingredients makes‌ them ⁤less likely to damage or corrode sensitive dishware,⁤ glassware,​ and silverware. ‍This is ​especially beneficial​ for delicate items like⁣ fine⁢ china, crystal, or items with decorative⁢ finishes. The oxygen boost removes tough stains without abrasive chemicals, ‍prolonging the life of your dishes.

**Residue-Free Cleaning:** Branch Basics‌ formulas are ​designed⁣ to rinse cleanly, leaving dishes sparkling and free from residue‌ that can affect ⁣the taste of ⁤food‍ or ⁣cause clouding and streaking. This ensures ​a more enjoyable ⁢and hygienic dining‌ experience. With traditional detergents, residue ⁤is a common complaint, making ​this a key benefit ⁣of ⁢Branch basics.

The Oxygen Boost can be added into the detergent dispenser with the all-purpose concentrate, or directly to the bottom of the dishwasher.

**Will Branch‌ Basics products damage my dishwasher?**
No, Branch Basics products are formulated ⁤to be gentle on dishwashers. the⁣ low-sudsing‍ formulas prevent excessive foam buildup that​ could⁤ potentially damage the ‌machine.

[[Explore Top rated best rv water filter on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=best rv water filter)

## Key Features Analysis

The market for RV water filters offers a variety of options, each with unique features and capabilities. Understanding these technical aspects is crucial for selecting the best filter to meet your specific needs.

**Filtration Stage Configuration:**

Some RV water filters come with multiple filtration stages. A typical setup might include a sediment filter to remove large particles, a carbon filter to remove chlorine, VOCs, and improve taste and odor, and a final polishing filter for finer particles. Higher-end filters may incorporate advanced filtration media like KDF (Kinetic degradation Fluxion) to inhibit bacterial growth or specialized resins to reduce heavy metals. The number and type of stages directly impact the water quality.

**Flow rate:**

The flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM), indicates how quickly the filter can deliver water. A higher flow rate ensures minimal pressure drop, allowing you to use multiple water fixtures simultaneously without a significant reduction in water pressure. Consider your RV's plumbing system and typical water usage when selecting a filter. Low flow rates can be frustrating, especially when showering or filling water tanks.

**Filter Capacity:**

Filter capacity refers to the amount of water a filter can effectively treat before needing replacement. This is often measured in gallons.Higher capacity filters require less frequent replacement, which reduces maintenance and operating costs. Consider your average water consumption per trip and choose a filter with sufficient capacity. Regular filter replacement is essential to maintain water quality.

**Housing Material and Construction:**

The housing material should be durable enough to withstand the rigors of RV travel, including vibrations and extreme temperatures. Look for filters with robust housings made from BPA-free materials that are resistant to cracking or leaking. Connection types are also significant, with standard garden hose fittings being the most common and convenient. Check for reinforced fittings to prevent leaks.

**Filter size and Installation:**

RVs have limited space, so filter size is a crucial factor.compact filters are easier to install and store. Consider whether you prefer an inline filter that connects directly to your water hose or a canister filter that mounts permanently to your RV’s plumbing. Installation complexity can vary; simpler inline filters are generally easy to install,while canister filters may require plumbing modifications.**Certifications and Standards:**

Look for filters that are certified by reputable organizations like NSF International. NSF certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets specific performance standards for contaminant reduction and material safety. Common certifications include NSF/ANSI Standard 42 for aesthetic effects (chlorine, taste, odor) and NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for health effects (lead, cysts).

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality RV water filter provides numerous benefits that enhance your RV experience and protect your health.**Improved Water Taste and Odor:** RV water filters effectively remove chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants that can negatively impact water taste and odor. This makes drinking water more palatable and improves the flavor of cooked foods and beverages. Such as, a filter with activated carbon can significantly reduce chlorine, leaving you with refreshing water to drink.

**Enhanced Health Protection:** Removing harmful contaminants like bacteria, protozoa, and heavy metals is vital for protecting your health while traveling. Many RV water filters are designed to reduce or eliminate waterborne pathogens, reducing the risk of illness and ensuring safe drinking water for yourself and your family. This is notably important when sourcing water from unknown or unregulated sources.

**Prolonged RV Plumbing Lifespan:** Sediment and other particles in unfiltered water can accumulate in your RV's plumbing system, causing clogs, reduced water pressure, and premature wear and tear on appliances like water heaters and washing machines. by removing these particles, an RV water filter helps extend the lifespan of your plumbing system and reduce maintenance costs.

**Protection of Appliances:** Appliances that use water,such as coffee makers,ice machines,and dishwashers,can suffer from mineral buildup and corrosion from unfiltered water. Filtered water is cleaner and less likely to cause scaling or damage to these appliances, prolonging their lifespan and maintaining their efficiency. For example, a water softener filter can prevent hard water stains on your dishes.

**Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have a reliable source of clean and safe water can significantly enhance your RV experience. With a quality RV water filter, you can confidently access water from various sources without worrying about potential contamination.This peace of mind allows you to focus on enjoying your travels and creating lasting memories.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about RV water filters can help clarify the selection process and ensure you choose the right filter for your needs.

**how often should I replace my RV water filter?**
The replacement frequency depends on the filter type, capacity, and water quality.Typically, sediment filters should be replaced every 3-6 months, while carbon filters can last 6-12 months. High water usage or poor water quality may require more frequent replacement. Always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for optimal performance.

**Can I use a standard home water filter in my RV?**
While some home water filters may technically fit, RV-specific filters are generally recommended. RV filters are designed to withstand the vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and space constraints of RV travel. they also often have fittings compatible with RV plumbing systems. Using a non-RV-specific filter may result in leaks or reduced performance.

**Do I need a water softener in addition to a water filter?**
A water softener is designed to remove minerals like calcium and magnesium that cause hard water. while a water filter removes sediments, chlorine and other contaminants, it doesn't soften water. If you frequently encounter hard water sources, a water softener can prevent scale buildup and improve the performance of appliances and fixtures. Combining both a water filter and a water softener provides comprehensive water treatment.

**What is the difference between an inline and a canister RV water filter?**

An inline filter connects directly to your water hose between the water source and your RV’s inlet. They are easy to install and replace but often have lower capacity and filtration capabilities compared to canister filters. Canister filters are permanently mounted to your RV’s plumbing system and offer higher capacity and more advanced filtration options. They may require professional installation and are more suitable for full-time RVers.

I'm a proper budget coffee drinker, I currently drink Alcafe Barista Moments Intenso instant coffee or use supermarket ground coffee for my Morphy Richards coffee to go machine. I used to have a Mokka pot but found cleaning a hassle and often burnt the coffee so that's gone. 
I've got the K0 grinder arriving today and should be getting the Aeropress original tomorrow as part of the PACT coffee welcome offer. I've opted for their house blend coffee beans as I predominantly drink black coffee. 
I know that without investing heavily, I won't be getting the best results but I'm hoping for an improved brew at home.

I have to pay for them but they are both on the lower income end to other therapies which I need. 

I’m nervous but excited. If these don’t help in the long-term then I’m at a loss.

When I met my partner, he was the most gorgeous, handsome and amazing healthy guy I’d ever spoken to. We instantly clicked. He was so so kind and caring. We went on two dates in the first week which was already a lot for me! Then a third and a forth, and made an effect everytime. 

Now 2.5 years in.. been living together for awhile, talked about the future. But somehow this spiral I’m currently in feels different.. almost like I feel I’m actually growing alongside the spiral and that I’ve decided we’re incompatible anyway and am content/happy with that? Which makes me feel super deflated.

I’ve done a lot of growing recently. Started jogging regularly (i never do exercise lol).. my work schedule is better, I feel inspired, but it’s almost like my relationship with my partner is the only thing that hasn’t grown. He has 2 days off a week which he typically spends studying and relaxing with his video games - but it’s like all my energy to try and ask “shall we go to the beach for a coffee” or “go to the cinema” or “do a puzzle” is gone. It’s almost like I’d RATHER leave him be, and I’d rather just do things on my own. I thrive on my own and I feel guilty for feeling like my partner adds nothing to my life atm. He’s caring and kind and looks after me well, but there’s just no stimulation there? I also do have ADHD so not sure if I’m bored.  

I put a post in another group yesterday about the idea of a ‘forever’ person terrifies me. And most people commented saying that this isn’t the way anyone ever looks at it. Humans change overtime, especially in their 20’s, and even if someone’s kind, handsome and gentle, other people will be too. You don’t have to latch onto the first kind person you have after so much abuse. You also don’t need to consider ‘forever’ at all in relationships - you just need to be happy/fulfilled in the moment and then reassess again in maybe 6-12 months and whenever/if the answer ever changes to a ‘no’ that’s when you leave - simple right? Potentially not helpful for us ROCD folk. 

I know I constantly give advice for others, but it’s like my feelings for him have turned off. I look over at him and think “wow he’s so handsome and cute just nerding out on his video game”, but otherwise, we do separate things, we work separate schedules, we’re happy quietly doing stuff alone. I don’t know what’s normal anymore. We’re still intimate even if it’s just hugs and kisses and saying we love each other. But I don’t know if, through my recent growth of genuinely finding out what sort of thing it is I need, that I’ve discovered I need someone slightly different? Someone with fire in his belly, a passion, ambitions, or someone who love the outdoors and gets up and goes out there - or.. I don’t know if this is just a preference (which would be silly to break up over) because he is making his own progress in his own time, but has owned up the fact he just doesn’t feel that passion in himself for anything - it’s like it almost just doesn’t exist. I’m sad. All my thoughts this past 2 weeks have literally been “if we breakup, where would I live/go?”.. I even imagine myself back at my parents house.. almost back at square one crying and I try imagine the feeling of having broken up with him and it’s devastating but not something I couldn’t handle? Idk if this is the ROCD illusion, part of my personal growth knowing I don’t NEED a man.. or genuine incompatibility. I almost feel the stupid ‘pull’ of reconnecting with him because I suck at no contact. And I even consider how it would feel to be sexually free/able to go a bit wild and have fun with new people. I had this type of ‘fun’ when I was younger but it became less and less appealing to me after I’d got it ‘out my system’ so I’m not sure why my brain is trying to encourage me to go feral.. reignite old flames for just one night.. meet new people in my city, even try dating girls for a bit. No regrets and all that. A teeny tiny part of me does still want to hold onto my partner. I’d never disrespect him he’s an angel. But I have no idea what the decision needs to be.

If so how much. 

For example, If my husband earns 80K USD a year and is it reasonable to ask for $250 a month? 

For context this money will be used for general maintenance and physical upkeep to look good for my husband and maybe a coffee a few times a week. 

My reason for asking this question is that I am worried that if I also earn my own money he will just throw all the burdens on me and we will be living like room mates and not a married couple. Giving me pocket money still allows him to have some sense of responsibility towards me. I don’t want thousands a month but just a reasonable amount that reminds him that he has a responsibility towards me too. 

In my previous marriage I was spending my entire salary on the home and groceries and doing 100% of the domestic work too. I don’t want that to happen to me again. ",2,1754294243.0,MuslimNikah,3,1.0,False

- canned black beans or chickpeas
- frozen green beans or asparagus
- rolled oats
- graham crackers
- milk
- crackers
- Greek yogurt

I usually have a few dollars left over depending on what I need that week that I save for other staples that I go through more slowly, like coffee and olive oil. This is my only income.

Every day I have overnight oats with the yogurt and some chia seeds for breakfast, and I make one cup of dry rice and one can of beans, eating half for dinner and half for lunch the next day. I snack on the fruit and crackers, sometimes with yogurt, and every other day or so if I have the energy I'll make a salad with the spinach and cucumber, or sautée some vegetables.

I still feel like I'm thinking about food all the time and I get hungry a lot, particularly at night.

Seeking feedback on the below itinerary for a couple on their first trip to Japan, which kicks off in just a few days. In general, this trip is going to be alot of 1.) picking a neighborhood and heading out into it early 2.) chilling during the hottest part of the day 3.) back out in the evening. Deeply appreciate warnings about absolutely terrible ideas and mistakes best avoided, but also things we might be overlooking in categories of interest. What are categories of interest, you ask?

* Anything and everything and just beneath the water (e.g. snorkeling, not scuba)
* Bookstores and local neighborhoods
* Urban architecture & infrastructure, e.g. walkable canals and funiculars
* Local markets, especially food markets and food halls
* Your favorite restaurant of literally any cuisine
* Neat department stores for (mostly) her, World War II history for (mostly) me.

Here's the breakdown, much of which was established with this here subreddit:

* **SAT, 9 August:** Arrive Narita @ 1600, probably taking the Limousine Bus to our Shinjuku accommodations. Clean up, walk around Shinjiku for dinner, crash.
* **SUN, 10 August - Thursday, 14 August - TOKYO:**
   * **Walking Routes:** Shinjuki Station to Shibuya Station; Ebisu over the hill to Shibuya via Daikanyama; Nippori Station to Ueno Stationj
   * **Ticketed**: Imperial Palace; National Museums (Tokyo National Museum); Shibuya Sky; Hokusai; From *Odaiba* \- Ferry to Asakusa
* **Unticketed**: 
   * Asakusa Senso-ji (Park + Temple); Ebisu Yokocho; Daikanyama T-Site; 
   * *Shimokitazawa* Walk-around (old Tokyo/Bohemian neighborhood); 
   * *Shinjiku* Hanazono-jinja Shrine Antique Market, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, Godzilla Head ([Location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Godzilla+Head/@35.6950521,139.6993368,779m/data=!3m3!1e3!4b1!5s0x60188cd8241c6fb7:0xb49c0a492285a910!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188d74dcc81ccd:0x2d7e490be8560647!8m2!3d35.6950521!4d139.7019117!16s%2Fg%2F11rqz9_01n?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYzMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D))

   * *Marunochi*: Intermediatheque ([intermediatheque.jp](http://intermediatheque.jp))
   * *Taito*: Ueno Park (Western-style park, U.S. Grant visited)
* **THU 14 August - Travel to Shizenju, Izu, Peninsula:** Late morning Shinkansen to Mishima to pick up a rental car to Shuzenji.
* **THU 14 August - SUN 17 August: Izu Peninsula**
   *  We would like our job to be beach, please. Thinking we'd start with Sirahama and Hirozo and then motor along the coast roads as we please.
   * We would, though, like to find a nice spot on the western coast to Fuji-gaze, if circumstances permit. 
   * We'll dedicate a portion of one day to do the Mount Omuru hike. We have a ryokan here, so breakfast and dinner are accounted for.
   * **Question:** The thinking is to utilize our dinner in the ryokan and then head back out in the evening for a sunset drive or wander about town. Is this ill-considered?
* **SUN, 17 August:** Return vehicle to Mishima and catch Shinkansen to Kyoto, for a hotel in Higashiyama. Probably won't push ourselves once we get in as we have the week in the area.
* **MON, 18 August - FRI, 22 August: Kyoto & Osaka.** Could certainly use help refining this, including whether a venture to Kobe makes sense. We are from Seattle and Kobe is our sister city. Recognizing this does not include major attractions like Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama, which I think we'll do if it's not absolutely nuked by tourists.
   * **Kyoto (Ticketed):** Ryoan-ji Temple, Kyoto; Kyoto Botanical Gardens; Toji Temple Market (August 21,[ Koubou-ichi / Kyoto Toji market](http://www.touji-ennichi.com/info/tohji_e.htm)); Kabuki Theater; Minamiza Theater; Saihoji Kokedera; Hozugawa River Cruise
   * **Osaka:** Dotonbori at night 
   * *Not Ticketed*: Isetan Department Store; Nishiki Market; [Ōkōchi Sansō | Discover Kyoto](https://www.discoverkyoto.com/places-go/okochi-sanso/); Weekender’s Coffee (multiple locations); Kōdaiji Temple (https://www.helenabradbury.com/blog-1/2-day-kyoto-itinerary)
* **FRI, 22 August:** Shinkansen from Kyoto to Himeji Castle. Store our bags to allow easy exploration. Return to Shinkansen station and continue on to Hiroshima before catching ferry to Miyajima Island for the night.
* **SAT, 23 August:** Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Park, and Museum. Also intrigued to make it to Shukkeien Garden. Evening tickets to a Hiroshima Toyo Carp Baseball Game. Hoping to also get around to some back-warren areas of the city.
* **SUN, 24 August:** Exploration of Miyajima Island, including Mount Misen.
* **MON, 25 August:** Flex day. Could just chill in an onsen, could go back out on the island again, or if we're up for it, maybe a day trip to Fukuoka. 
* **TUE, 26 August:** Relaxed morning before catching Shinkansen back to Haneda Airport for 9:55PM return flight to the U.S.

TDLR: can a woman gift stuff to a man and not come off as too much? Is handmade coffee mug too much? Looking for ideas for a joke/fake merch gift. 

I (a woman) have a Dutch friend (a man) with whom I’ve been chatting online for nearly a year. We’ve met in person once when I flew in to see him and another friend from the region. I don’t live in the Netherlands. We’re friends, though sometimes we send each other mixed signals. We’re both in our mid-30s.

I want to post him something.

I’ve been reading this sub for a while now and understand that Dutch people might not be too keen on gifts if they feel like there’s an expectation to return the favour. I also get that it should be something modest (doe normaal and all that)

I mentioned the idea of sending him something by post, and he gave me his mailing address. So, I assume that it means he doesn’t mind receiving something from me.

My original idea was a small handmade ceramic coffee mug, but after reading some more here, I’m wondering if that’s maybe a bit much? too much effort? maybe too personal? 

And is it even very doe normaal for a woman to send a gift to a man in this way? Should I stick to maybe some snacks from my region or something like that? Or maybe a small coffee mug, just not handmade? I really don’t want it to come across as too intense or suggestive. I rather enjoy our ""friends, or?..."" dynamic and would like to keep it this way.

There is no holiday attached to the gift either. Idea was to make it into a fake merch of his... business. Like a joke merch. But I want it to be practical besides being funny. 

Other cultural commentary welcomed!

# Best Black Walnut Table 2025: Styles & Reviews

Black walnut tables represent more than just functional furniture; they are statements of style, craftsmanship, and enduring quality. As we look towards 2025, the demand for these gorgeous and versatile pieces continues to grow. Known for thier rich hues, unique grain patterns, and durable nature, black walnut tables are increasingly sought after for dining rooms, living rooms, and home offices alike. This review explores the latest trends, features, and considerations for those looking to invest in a black walnut table that will stand the test of time. Whether you're a seasoned interior designer or a first-time homeowner, this guide will help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The construction and design of a black walnut table are crucial factors that determine its overall quality and suitability for your space.

**Wood Source and Quality:** The origin and grade of the black walnut wood are paramount. Premium tables are crafted from sustainably sourced, kiln-dried wood that minimizes warping and cracking.

Tables sourced from responsibly managed forests contribute to environmental conservation and ensure long-term availability of this valuable resource. kiln-drying reduces moisture content, making the wood more stable and less prone to movement over time. Additionally, the grade of the wood determines the presence of knots and imperfections, with higher grades featuring fewer blemishes and more consistent grain patterns.

**Tabletop Thickness and Edge Design:** The thickness of the tabletop and the design of its edges significantly impact the table's visual appeal and structural integrity.

thicker tabletops, typically ranging from 1.5 to 2 inches, offer increased durability and a substantial feel. Edge designs can vary from simple straight edges to beveled,live-edge,or waterfall designs. Live-edge tables preserve the natural contours of the tree, adding a rustic and organic touch, while waterfall edges create a seamless flow from the tabletop to the table legs. Beveled edges can give the table a lighter, more refined look.**Base Material and Construction:** The table base provides essential support and contributes to the table's overall aesthetic. Common materials include metal, wood, and combinations thereof.

Metal bases, frequently enough made of steel or wrought iron, offer a modern and industrial look, while wooden bases provide a warmer and more customary feel. The construction of the base should be sturdy and well-engineered to ensure stability and prevent wobbling. Look for bases with reinforced joints and solid connections between the tabletop and legs.

**Finish and Protective Coating:** The finish applied to the black walnut wood protects it from moisture, scratches, and stains while enhancing its natural beauty.Common finishes include oil-based, water-based, and lacquer coatings. Oil-based finishes penetrate the wood,providing a rich and lustrous appearance,while water-based finishes are more environmentally friendly and offer good protection. lacquer coatings create a durable and glossy surface that is resistant to spills and scratches. The finish should be applied evenly and smoothly to highlight the wood's natural grain patterns.

Key features of a high-quality black walnut table include:

   Sustainably sourced, kiln-dried wood
   Durable construction with reinforced joints
   protective finish that enhances the wood's natural grain
   Aesthetically pleasing design that complements various interior styles

Supporting sustainable forestry practices helps protect forests and ensures the long-term availability of this valuable resource.

1mh7b63,https://i.redd.it/b83dq2onhygf1.jpeg,My Lp(a) results. Next steps - LDL management.,"As many members of the sub suggested that I get my Lp(a) serum checked immediately, I had one done. I got the results a while ago : Less than 10 mg/dL

I was so relieved that I made myself a cup of coffee :D (I had been limiting coffee to 1 cup/day after reading that it raises your LDL level)

However since my LDL is a125ish and the total cholesterol/HDL ratio is slightly higher than 4, combined with the fact that my dad and his 2 brothers (one died!) had a heart attack, I have decided to heavily cut saturated fat for the next 3 months (I shall keep it below 10 mg/day). As I am also trying to bulk, I will focus on plant-based diet + fish and avoid other meat or dairy products. I will then get my lipid profile tested again after 3 months and will visit a cardiologist to decide on further steps necessary. I have even made up my mind that I will happily start Statin if the doc tells me to.

I know prioritizing my heart health will be costly - I will need to give up on things I love, maybe I won't be able to bulk the way I want, give up on activities I enjoy, prioritize cardio to HIIT, and so on. But I feel that if I tread the path for some time, I would reap benefits other than improved cardiovascular health.

All in all, I'm very happy but cautious/conscious at the same time.

I was in a relationship for a year. He was amazing to me. Kind,exciting, caring. He would make me coffee at his work after I finished university and tried to make sure I was okay. I was intensely  burnt out and I think he could tell when I was struggling. It was right around the end of my second year of university. My largest burn out yet was around the corner and I was stressed but more than that I felt empty. I wanted for nothing and I felt nothing, just flares anger. 

So when I woke up suddenly feeling nothing for this man I couldnt help but think maybe this will pass. This must be circumstantial right? Feelings don't  dissapear like that. He could tell I was growing distant. My birthday was around the corner and I had made the impulsive decision to break up with him.
I didn't  want him to get me gifts when I was so unsure of my feelings. Unfortunately for us he already had. He was willing to still give them to me. A cat pin, 2 fittonia plants, and a handmade clay model of my favourite flower. All things He knew I would love. The plants have been dead for 6 months and still sit on my window sill. The cat pin sits on my trincket dish and the lilly of the valley model on my desk. I cant bring myself to throw them away.

The break up was fast. Seeing him on the edge of tears hurt me but I felt I had no right to cry. That feeling was brief. I still can't understand myself.I walked back into the building and starting working again like it was nothing. I felt nothing. Even saying it out loud to my friend "" I just broke up with my boyfriend"" sounded odd when my voice was so unfeeling. They thought it was weird of me. I was raving about him just days ago.

We messaged briefly in the past year. Ended on good terms. But that brings us to now.
It is summer. All of our college friends and mutuals are in the city and he had opened up a business. I leave my house for months at a time so my friends had dragged me out. We went to his event. I didnt feel my nerves till I was inside.
It was only when I saw him again that I felt something. And when he said my name it repeated in my mind until the next morning. He had said hello to me. Our only interaction. I was jealous, what if he had found someone else? I was angry at myself for letting him go and was scared about what these feelings mean.

I heard he was nervous to see me too. Why would that make me feel good?
I was dragged out again a few weeks later. Same friends, same place. This time nothing more than a wave from him.
Why now? Why after a YEAR would I process how I feel now? 
Why is it I can go days without thinking about him since I last saw him and then think about him the whole 24 hours another day?

I have heard another woman experience break ups this way as a result of her ADHD. Does anyone share a similar experience?

1mh73q0,https://i.redd.it/rx9bcf2qhygf1.jpeg,I took a 10000x Salvia Extract Part-1,"As far as I can piece together, I was a heavy drug user. My apartment confirms it: AA and NA coins scattered across the floor like relics of promises I broke. The studio is cramped, suffocating. Two walls are lined with shelves holding two dozen ten-gallon cases, each brimming with a stalky plant crowned by a purple flower, its petals almost glowing under the cheap grow lights. An intricate watering system snakes across the ceiling, weaving into the bathroom and disappearing into the upper deck of the toilet. The whole room feels alive, like it’s breathing with me.
When I woke up earlier, my mouth was dry, dry like a bonsai abandoned in space. No alarm. No TV blaring static. Just the violent shake of a thin, sickly man standing over me. His glazed grey eyes looked like they’d been encased in Epoxy. A pot leaf tattoo sprawled across his cheek; obscured words crawled across his neck.
He ripped a blister pack of Xanax from my hand, one I didn’t even remember holding and glared at me. Hatred. Disappointment. Both at once.
I couldn’t even ask what his problem was. My breath caught as I finally read the words on his neck.
“Mother Divinorum.”
Something cold crept up my spine, chewing at the edges of my sanity. The man’s expression didn’t change. He just turned, walked out, and slammed the door.
Searching for any clue of who I was, I scoured the apartment. On the coffee table sat my wallet and phone, sticky with fingerprints. When I powered it on, I absorbed every bit of information it gave me: Toni Sage Arceneaux, twenty-two, from Greece. Psychedelics enthusiast.
A photo stopped me cold. Me, holding a purple Kuromi bong, ice fogging the glass, the bowl loaded with something that looked like liquefied amethyst. The caption read:
“Είθε η μητέρα να μας κάνει ολόκληρους.”
 (May Mother make us whole.)
That’s when it all came rushing back: the trip, and my long, deceitful relationship with Mother Divinorum.
My first encounter with Salvia or seer’s sage, the plant Salvia or seer’s sage, the plant every Psychonaut longed for but dared not touch.
I still remember the French Quarter, the smell of rain on brick as I made my way to my favorite parking garage overlooking the Mississippi. The top floor was my escape, my throne until I noticed a beaten-down van parked too close to my lawn chair. Its speakers screamed Korn into the humid night. I decided I’d grab my chair quickly and avoid whoever was inside.
As I reached for it, the van door slid open.
It was him, the same man who shook me awake. Frank.
His pale green eyes were already fogging, like frost spreading across glass.
“Hey, you smoke?” he asked, his voice scraping against my nerves.
I stammered, then nodded.
“Looking for something new?”
“I’m not interested,” I snapped. “I’m not throwing away my sobriety for some Chinese drywall cut with god knows what. I just want my chair.”
He chuckled. “Not like that. It’s natural. Care to have a look?”
My hand closed around the pink pocket knife in my hoodie. He noticed fast. Too fast for any street junkie.
“I mean you no harm,” he said, almost offended. “Honestly, the opposite.”
“You still haven’t told me your name. Or what you’re offering. Or anything that would make me even remotely comfortable stepping into your van.”
“You have a point, friend.” His voice softened, almost hypnotic. “Name’s Frank Panon. What I offer isn’t poison. It's psychedelic. My home, really.”
New Orleans was full of dealers, but none like this. The closest to psychedelics here was PCP.
“Listen, malaka, nice meeting you, but I’m taking my chair and finding a new garage.”
“What about a free sample?” His grin widened, not friendly but knowing. “What kind of dealer kills his potential customers, gnostos?”
We switched to Greek, something in common and after a tense back-and-forth, I agreed to look. But I made it clear: if he tried anything, I’d fight.
Inside, the van felt like a shrine. Purple-green plants grew from every corner, twisting around furniture like they owned the place. Frank moved among them with a reverence that chilled me. Every time a leaf brushed him, he whispered an apology.
He grabbed a small jar from the dash and placed it in my hand. It looked like lip gloss. The label read:
 “Violet Solar System – 500x Extract.”
I shot him a skeptical look. He just pointed at the nearest plant.
“This is Salvia Divinorum,” he said, voice trembling with awe. “The strongest psychedelic you’ll ever meet. Add it to a bowl, somewhere safe. And… don’t forget to put down the piece.” His laugh was soft, almost nervous.
The jar felt heavy, like it wanted to be smoked.
“You need a trip sitter?” he asked.
I should’ve said no. Should’ve walked away. Should’ve left my stupid lawn chair and never looked back.
But I didn’t. I sat on his bed. He packed the bowl. He handed me his phone for music. I queued something that felt safe, something that tethered me to reality.
He put the mausoleum glass pipe in my hand. I expected fear. Doubt. Instead, an unnatural calm washed over me. I cradled it like a newborn. It felt wrong to light it carelessly, so I let Frank spark it.
The smoke slid down my throat like a serpent. Warmth bloomed inside me love, appreciation, a maternal presence I never had surrounding me like a womb.
I exhaled. The world tilted. Frank laid me back and pulled the blanket over me.
Then the floor melted. My body dissolved. Ego death swallowed me whole.
When I regained something resembling “self,” I stood in a forest of impossible geometry. Leaves shifted shape as I moved. A song rose through the air, deep, sultry, female, vibrating the world itself. Her voice was a siren call, and every part of me needed to see her.
The plants turned purple as I followed the sound. The path stretched longer, her voice fainter. I ran, but the forest pulled back. Her song became a tease.
Then reality ripped me away.
I woke up gasping, eyes wide, recognizing Frank as the room came back into focus.
“Did you meet her?” he asked.
“The singing,” I croaked. “I couldn’t reach her. Who is she? How could you know what I saw?”
Frank smiled like a priest.
“You’ll need a higher extract,” he said.
 “Mother Divinorum longs for you.”

1mh72uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1mh72uf/watched_the_same_news_report_twice_it_wasnt_a/,Watched the same news report twice. It wasn't a recording.,"This happened last Thursday morning, and I can't stop thinking about it. I’m not a paranoid person. I work in IT, live alone, no drugs, no alcohol. I say that because I know how this sounds.

My alarm is set for 7:00 a.m. but I woke up at 6:20 for no reason. Just wide awake. The room was dark except for the glow of the TV — which was weird in itself. I never fall asleep with it on.

The news was on. A live report. A female anchor talking about a school lockdown in Michigan. There had been “a credible threat reported by staff,” she said. I remember that line exactly. She looked tense. She stumbled slightly on the word *“incident.”* They showed a blurry aerial shot of the building, and the screen read:

**""Breaking: East Hill Elementary – Active Lockdown""**

I thought it was strange they’d be reporting it so early — like it had just happened — but I didn’t think much of it. I left the TV on, went to make coffee, scrolled my phone for about ten minutes.

When I came back into the room, the news was *still* talking about the same thing. But not as an update — it was **identical.**  
Same anchor. Same expression. Same slight stutter.  
Even the shaky aerial footage repeated, with the exact same freeze-frame glitch halfway through.

I checked the time: 6:34. I hadn’t been gone long. The live ticker kept moving normally, showing the right time. No rewind. No video replay indication.  
I grabbed the remote to check the program info. It just said: *“Live Morning Report – 6am to 9am.”*

Nothing made sense.

But here’s the part that really messes with me:

Later that day, I looked up East Hill Elementary. I figured it might’ve been a local news story that didn’t go national. But there’s **no school with that name in Michigan.**  
None.  
Not in Oakland County, Wayne County, or anywhere.  
There’s no news reports archived for that day.  
No lockdowns. No threats. No anchor with that name.

I even asked a coworker who watches the same morning station. He said they were covering traffic delays and a mayoral election that morning — no school lockdown.

So either I hallucinated a full segment with fake footage and fabricated names while holding a hot cup of coffee… or I watched the news *from somewhere else.* Somewhere that bled into here.  
Just for ten minutes.

Has anyone else ever seen a “live broadcast” that no longer exists?",6,1754292890.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1,0.88,False

I'll be traveling home from Kyoto early to mid-November, flying out of Narita. I'll have already been to Tokyo so thought I'd stay somewhere else on my way back and then travel directly to the airport. 

I was planning on Kamakura as I like outdoor areas (gardens, temples, trails), reading in coffee shops and wandering neighbourhoods, and then got looking at Hakone.  

If you had 3 nights to spend between Kyoto and Narita, would you go to either of these and if so which one? 

If it matters,  I have large tattoos and would love to visit a nice onsen out in nature, but I know my options are pretty limited given I can't cover mine up. So might not be possible on this trip.*

1mh70u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/comments/1mh70u1/a_grassroots_action_plan_to_mobilize_real_climate/,A grassroots action plan to mobilize real climate action,"If you’ve been watching the climate get worse and feeling like nothing you do matters like me, then good, because that’s the point of me posting this, tonight at 2AM, as I lie awake yet again, worrying about the state of our environment. 

We’ve been sold the idea that climate action is a privileged lifestyle choice, that the system will self-correct if enough of us “choose green.” But all that framing has done is preserve the wealth and power of the real culprits behind the damage while making the rest of us feel responsible, anxious, guilty, hopeless, and isolated. 

It truly think collective pressure, coordinated political engagement, and strategic disruptions are basically the only levers left that will actually move the needle now. The window to act is closing, and the people who benefit from the delay in climate action are already working behind the scenes to protect their profits and power from the worst of the damage that is coming. 

The one thing I know for certain is that the people profiting from the climate crisis aren’t going to give up power because they feel guilty. It’s more than likely that they don’t feel guilty at all and will just continue to shift the narratives, and fund more delay campaigns, and legislate loopholes. That is, unless we make it costly and time-consuming for them. 

So I’ve devised a simple plan that everyone should be able to follow. And if we all actually make an effort, I think it could actually work. 

Step 1:

The first step is getting the story straight and correct and spreading it everywhere. For too long, many people have avoided the topic, either out of fear of causing arguments or sounding like a radical or an alarmist, and sometimes simply because it feels easier not to think about an uncomfortable subject. But silence and avoidance only breed further division and inaction.

Also, too many conversations begin and end with guilt and blaming about single-use plastics instead of naming who’s rigging the game in the first place. Most people don’t even realize that a small handful of companies and individuals have warped the narrative so much that they’ve made us feel like climate responsibility is a personal responsibility. 

The truth is that fossil fuel producers and their investors have been linked to over 70% of historic industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.  ￼ Governments, meanwhile, make fossil fuels seem “cheap” by subsidizing them. (Other major contributor include agriculture, plastic, and pharmaceuticals). 

Their “cheap” gas and heating costs are hiding massive societal bills, and that legal and policy structures are stacked to protect those polluters while silencing anyone who challenges them.


Step 2:

Once there is shared understanding, begin building local groups for activism. And when I say “group”, it doesn’t have to be something huge. It can literally just be three friends meeting over coffee, a handful of neighbours, online friends, etc. Basically, the only job of those gatherings is to turn awareness into coordinated intention. Someone brings a recent policy development to explain. Someone else shares a local impact story. Another person asks, “What are we doing about it this week?”

And as a side note, but still heavily related: political engagement needs to stop being the abstract “write your MP” suggestion and become a group activity!! Organize “constituent pressure evenings” where you and a few others draft and send coordinated messages to elected officials, asking specific questions about how current policies align with their stated climate goals. (Eg. reference a local development approval that lacks proper environmental assessment, call out a bill or regulation that weakens oversight and local voices, etc.). 

If they try to brush aside your climate concerns as “too complicated” or “not the right time”, continue to show up anyway. Ask uncomfortable questions, and do it in visible pairs or small teams so officials can’t dismiss you as a “lone crank”. 

The presence of informed citizens in numbers, no matter what size, changes the dynamic because it signals that silence is no longer the default!

Step 3:

Identify the most accessible pressure points you can go after, like municipal councils debating development approvals, school boards considering curriculum or fleet emissions policies, regional planning processes, and any public consultation related to energy, transit, or land use. 

Whatever it is you choose, just make sure to define the climate goals that matter most in your region, and then use that language consistently across your network. 

Also, elevate and advocate for voices that are too often left out, like Indigenous groups, frontline community members, students, and working-class people living with increasing climate impacts. When the narrative is broad and inclusive, it becomes harder for opponents to frame the movement as fringe or self-interested.

If a proposal or new policy tries to slip through without proper assessment, mobilize a rapid response through phone calls, emails, form submissions, local op-eds, and social media amplification. Public presence and vocal local opposition often scares bureaucrats and developers more than distant national outrage!! 

(I can also confirm this method does eventually work from recent experience! Patience and persistence are the keys lol)

Step 4: 

Celebrate and broadcast any of your wins, even if you win something seemingly small, like getting a local representative to publicly commit to reviewing a loophole. 

Share it everywhere you can with the framing that “this was possible because of organized civic pressure”. 

That recognition does two things: 1. it rewards people who showed up, and 2. it signals to fence-sitters that participation actually works. 

Equally important, when things go sideways and a bad policy passes or gets greenlit, debrief it publicly. Explain what happened, why it succeeded, and what the next point of pressure is; people will stay more engaged if the path forward is clear. 

Step 6:

Finally, there will more than likely come moments where the window for polite engagement closes, and that’s when things like civil disobedience, strategic non-violent disruption, and symbolic public actions can break the “business as usual” complacency. 

That could mean coordinated public demonstrations outside official/corporate offices, peaceful occupations of policy forums, or coordinated days of action that temporarily slow the machinery of fossil fuel expansion. There are many, MANY ways to disrupt the status quo in non-violent ways, but the main thing it gets across is that the people are NOT going to step aside quietly! ✊🏼

History shows that when systems are locked in by concentrated interests, transformative change rarely comes from waiting; it comes from making the cost of continuing the old way higher than the cost of change. 

So if you’re still breathing and still reading, you have more influence and power than you’ve been led to believe, and your influence isn’t limited to what you choices you make as a consumer. 

It expands with who you organize with, what systems you pressure, and how many others you bring into the conversation with a clear plan; so, talk to someone today, gather your first group, and start building a local node that isn’t willing to accept the 1% who are profiting off our delayed or absent climate action and creating division among the 99%.  

If we’re going to accomplish anything meaningful as a society, we all need to stop pretending that ditching plastic straws and using reusable bags will save us, and start organizing the masses. Despite what we’ve been indoctrinated to believe, when we work together (even at the grassroots level!), we do actually have the power to stop normalising the status quo and begin to force systemic change.

A nerd in quite literally every sense of the word and unapologetically so. I’m the type of person who can lose hours in the grimdark lore of Warhammer 40k, debate the finer points of Star Wars vs. LOTR over coffee, or obsessively rewatch my favorite sci-fi or horror films while quoting lines like it’s a second language.

Gaming is a regular escape and music is my deepest love, the kind that makes you feel seen, like it’s narrating your life in the background. I’m fascinated by the cosmos, drawn to the deep, mysterious pull of the ocean, and always curious about the unexplored. Anime is another passion, equal parts comfort and inspiration.

I’m introspective, a bit sarcastic, weird in the best way, and always down for a meaningful or ridiculous conversation, whichever direction the energy flows.

What am I looking for?
Look, I can’t 3D print my perfect FWB (yet), but if a hypothetical gun was pointed my way, I’d say: someone curvy, nerdy, heavy emphasis on the nerd part. Someone with a sharp wit, emotional depth, and who knows how to actually carry a conversation without it feeling like pulling teeth.


Ideally, I’d love something that feels like a friendship with tension, where we can geek out, talk late into the night, make each other laugh, maybe share playlists… and let things evolve naturally into the other zone. Being able to enjoy each other’s company, fully clothed and not, is kind of the dream.

I think you should make a decision soon.



Chairman Zhan said that if he signs this document, he will immediately help save the Tong family.



The condition is that you and him must no longer have any lingering relationship. If you're going to cut it, you have to cut it completely.""



In the dimly lit living room of a Chinese mansion, on a Qing Dynasty sandalwood chair, a young woman with a face so beautiful it could almost be called seductive showed no emotion.



She didn't hesitate any longer, picked up a pen and signed her name, Tong Fei, at the bottom of the document on the coffee table.



Handwriting as beautiful as yours



""Attorney Qi, please go back and tell Chairman Zhan that you thank him for his generosity.



I will do as he wishes.""



Tong Fei's voice was gentle and calm, just like her own.



Her clear eyes seemed to reflect the bright sky.



Lawyer Qi stood up and collected the divorce documents: ""Chairman Zhan said you can stay in this mansion until tomorrow.""



""I'll have to bother you to go back and tell him again.



When I don't want to have a relationship that is in flux, I will immediately cut off the ties of love.



This house, I'm moving out today.""



Lawyer Qi sighed: ""Then... Madam, goodbye.""



""Please call me Mr. Tong, Attorney Qi. We won't meet again.""



Lawyer Qi felt that he didn't want to see Tong Fei again, so he held the documents and left.



In the empty living room, it was so quiet that you could almost hear your heart beating.



She looked around the mansion where she had lived for three years, her hand gently rubbing her lower abdomen, and she couldn't help but smile.



Two years of secret love, three years of open love, two years of engagement, one year of marriage...



Eight years, she loved him for eight years, he was bored with her for eight years.



Until now, the marriage she loved one-sidedly has ended.



Pain? Regret? These feelings are real.



But she thinks she has progressed.



She used to think that if Zhan Tianjue ever left her, she would want to commit suicide.



But now, she doesn't have that kind of thought anymore.



Suicide for a man who...doesn't love you? No way.



She is no longer the innocent girl she was eight years ago.



Since that night when he got drunk and had sex with her, but his mouth kept calling out other women's names, she knew that her love would never bear fruit.



After eight years, shouldn't even the iron tree have blossomed?



For a man who wouldn't even divorce her personally, what else could she say?



She slowly got up and walked up the stairs to her bedroom.



This is their bridal chamber, but since their engagement until now, she has moved in for three years. In these three years, he has only slept here one night.



And that night, he got drunk...



From the most famous beauty in Ancheng to Ancheng's number one abandoned wife, it only took one day.



She opened the drawer of her bedside table and took out his passport, ID card, the bank card he used before the marriage, and an abortion appointment slip for this afternoon.



Like this, you're considered to have left the house empty-handed.



As I left the mansion, at the main gate, the black Lexus window slowly rolled down.



A young man's voice, both careless and charming, rang out: ""For the last time, do you want me to send you off?""



Look at the handsome, mature and mysterious face sitting in the back seat.



Even now, when she sees this face, her heart still beats faster.



But she is not a fool, she has her own pride.



She tried to straighten her back, making herself look less miserable.



""No need, Chairman Zhan. Thank you for your kindness. I don't have much. There's no need for someone to send me off.""



...

The young man's cold gaze fell on her face.



Tong Fei smiled at the corner of his mouth: “And the property division contract that Chairman Zhan gave me, I have already placed it on the coffee table in your living room.



Thank you for your kindness. Both Dong family and I will not bother you again.



As you wish, I will disappear from your world forever.



Take care of yourself.""



Tong Fei proudly held up her small bag and walked away, trying hard not to let the tears flow.



It's over.



The Dong family is over, her marriage is over, she... finally has nothing left.



Really good



Dad was right. People pay for their own decisions.



When the one who made the wrong decision was you



Now, even if you feel sad, it's not your right.



In the car, Zhan Tianjue narrowed his eyes dangerously.



""Brother Huang, drive the car.""



""Second Young Master, are you not interested in the madam?""



""I told you to drive"" is an order.



""yes""



Brother Huang started the car and drove away.



As the Lexus drove past her, Tong Fei smiled at the corner of her mouth.



Depression is for oneself only.



Zhan Tianjue looked at Tong Fei, who was smiling with the corner of his mouth, through the rearview mirror.



His dangerous eyes narrowed.



Proud, huh? It seems like you really don't lack anything.



This is what he hates the most.



He wanted to know how long she could stay proud.



She walked almost three kilometers before she could hail a taxi.



Arriving at the hospital, she stood there, hesitating in a daze.



Are you really going to give up this little life?



This is her child and he who she has been waiting for all day and night.



If it weren't for him being drunk, she wouldn't have had the chance to have this child.



Are you really sure you won't regret it?



She took a deep breath and looked up at the sky.



On the electronic screen of a skyscraper in the distance



An Cheng's latest economic news was clearly visible before her eyes.



Business tycoon Ancheng, Young Master Zhanrong, and his wife Zhan Tianjue have completed their divorce proceedings today.



He will hold the wedding of the century in a month to marry the girl of his heart, Ye Zhen.



In that moment, her heart broke and tears poured out.



She took a few steps back until she reached the hospital wall, her body leaning firmly against it.



Now, the last straw that will save her life is only a wall strong enough to support her weight.



Ye Zhen, Ye Zhen... Why... Why does it have to be you?



She took another deep breath and stared at the smiling young woman holding onto Zhan Tianjue's arm as she walked into the hotel amidst the flashes of light.



The two looked at each other deeply for a while.



Those sweet gazes pierced Tong Fei's eyes.



On the day of her second year graduation, when she heard that Zhan Tianjue was willing to get engaged to her, she held Ye Zhen's hand and went crazy playing all day.



Ye Zhen held her hand and asked, “Fei Fei, is this Zhan Tianjue family really that big?”



""Hmm, very impressive. And most importantly, Brother Jue is very handsome.



You know, just looking into his eyes makes me feel full.



If I had to choose between my favorite snack and Brother Jue's,



I would choose fasting without any hesitation.



Oh... Zhenzhen, I want to scream like this forever.



Today is the happiest day of my life.



Come on, congratulate me. Come on.""



Ye Zhen smiled with envy: “To be engaged to such a man, you must be so happy.”



Congratulations, congratulations, my love.""



The funny thing is that she still kissed Ye Zhen's cheek hard.



At that time, she told Ye Zhen all her secrets, inner feelings, and dreams that she was too embarrassed to speak about.



Thinking of these things, she raised her hand and wiped the corner of her mouth hard.



...

How disgusting!



She felt a lot of hatred, but not because Zhan Tianjue abandoned her or because Ye Zhen betrayed her.



But I hate that I'm blind.



She is clearly a person with good eyes but a blind heart.



เธอดึงใบนัดทำแท้งออกจากกระเป๋า ฉีกมันเป็นชิ้นเล็กชิ้นน้อยแล้วโยนขึ้นฟ้า



ไปให้พ้นกับการผ่าตัดนั่น



เมื่อกลับถึงคฤหาสน์ตระกูลถง ที่บ้านวุ่นวายไปหมดแล้ว



คนรับใช้หลายคนที่ทำงานให้ตระกูลถงมาหลายปีกำลังยืนขวางประตูเรียกร้องเงินเดือน



การปรากฏตัวของเธอทำให้ทุกคนเบนความสนใจมาที่เธอ



""คุณหนูใหญ่กลับมาแล้ว""



คนรับใช้หลายคนได้ยินเสียงแล้วหันมามอง เห็นว่าเป็นถงเฟยกลับมาจริงๆ



พวกเขาทั้งหมดรุมล้อมเธอเหมือนฝูงผึ้ง



""คุณหนูใหญ่ ในที่สุดคุณก็กลับมา



ท่านถงบอกว่าบ้านล้มละลายแล้ว จะปลดพวกเราออก



พวกเราทำงานให้บ้านตงมาหลายปีแล้ว รู้ว่าตอนนี้บ้านตงมีปัญหา



พวกเราไม่ได้เรียกร้องเงินชดเชยอะไร



แต่อย่างน้อยก็ต้องจ่ายเงินเดือนให้พวกเราสิ



ท่านถงแอบอยู่ในห้องไม่ยอมออกมา



นี่มันเรื่องอะไรกัน



พวกเราไม่ได้รับเงินเดือนมาครึ่งปีแล้ว""



ถงเฟยมองประตูที่ปิดสนิทนอกทางเข้าวิลล่า



เธอพูดอย่างสงบ: ""ทุกคนวางใจได้ ถึงบ้านตงจะล้มแล้ว



แต่เงินเดือนเล็กน้อยนี้ บ้านตงจะไม่เบี้ยวแน่นอน



ฉันจะจ่ายให้พวกคุณเอง""



""คุณหนูใหญ่ แล้วคุณจะจ่ายเงินเดือนให้พวกเราเมื่อไหร่ล่ะ



พวกเราดูข่าวแล้ว



คุณหย่ากับสามีแล้วไม่ใช่เหรอ



พวกเราไม่ได้ตั้งใจจะทำร้ายจิตใจคุณนะ



พวกเราแค่อยากได้เงินเดือนเท่านั้น""



ถงเฟยกำมือแน่น นี่มันสมจริงกับสำนวนที่ว่า เมื่อต้นไม้ล้ม ลิงก็กระจาย กำแพงพัง คนก็ช่วยกันผลัก



เธอเม้มปาก: ""ลุงเฉิน ช่วยคำนวณดูหน่อยว่าบ้านตงติดค้างเงินเดือนทุกคนเท่าไหร่



บอกฉันแล้ว ฉันจะโอนเงินให้พวกคุณทันที""



ลุงเฉินมองถงเฟยด้วยสายตาเห็นใจแล้วพยักหน้า



เขาเรียกทุกคนไปด้านข้างเพื่อคำนวณตัวเลข



หลังจากผ่านไปเพียงสิบกว่านาที ลุงเฉินเดินมาบอก: ""คุณหนูใหญ่ คำนวณเสร็จแล้ว



ที่นี่มีคนรับใช้ทั้งหมดห้าคน



ทุกคนไม่ได้รับเงินเดือนมาครึ่งปีแล้ว



รวมทั้งหมด 140,000 หยวน""



""ลุงเฉิน คำนวณผิด มีหกคนต่างหาก""



ลุงเฉินยิ้มบางๆ: ""ผมทำงานให้บ้านตงมาสิบปีแล้ว



ผมเป็นคนที่เคยได้รับบุญคุณจากบ้านตง



เงินเดือนผมไม่เอาแล้ว ผมก็ไม่ได้ตั้งใจจะออกไปไหน""



ถงเฟยมองลุงเฉินด้วยความซาบซึ้ง เธอค้อมตัวเล็กน้อย: ""ลุงเฉิน ขอบคุณมากนะคะ""



เธอหยิบบัตรธนาคารออกมายื่นให้ลุงเฉิน: ""รหัสคือวันเกิดของฉัน



ลุงเฉิน ช่วยไปโอนเงินให้หน่อยนะคะ""



""ได้ครับ คุณหนู""



หลังจากทุกคนเดินตามลุงเฉินออกไปแล้ว ถงเฟยเดินไปที่ประตูแล้วเคาะ: ""พี่ เปิดประตูหน่อย""



ประตูถูกเปิดจากด้านใน



ถงเฉินถอนหายใจโล่งอกเมื่อเห็นถงเฟย: ""เด็กบ้าเอ๊ย เกิดอะไรขึ้นกับเธอ



ข่าวที่พี่เห็นวันนี้เป็นข่าวปลอมใช่ไหม พวกเธอไม่ได้หย่ากันใช่ไหม""



""ข่าวเศรษฐกิจจะเป็นข่าวปลอมได้ยังไงล่ะ"" ถงเฟยยิ้มขื่นแล้วก้าวเข้าไปข้างใน



""ถงเฟย เธอบ้าไปแล้วเหรอ



พี่สงสัยว่าทำไมคนพวกนี้รู้ว่าบ้านตงล้มละลายแล้วยังทำงานอยู่ที่นี่ดีๆ



วันนี้ทำไมจู่ๆ ก็มาวุ่นวาย



ที่แท้ก็เพราะเธอนี่เอง



เธอคิดอะไรอยู่ เธอกล้าหย่ากับจั่นเทียนจวี้ได้ยังไง



เธอไม่รู้หรือว่าตอนนี้บ้านตงอยู่ในสถานการณ์แบบไหน



รีบโทรไปหาจั่นเทียนจวี้แล้วยอมรับความผิดซะ



ตอนนี้เธอหย่าไม่ได้หรอก เธอไม่รู้เหรอ""



ถงเฟยหันไปจ้องถงเฉิน



หลังจากหย่า ไม่มีใครเจ็บปวดมากกว่าเธอ



ไม่มีการปลอบโยน ไม่มีความห่วงใย มีแต่การตำหนิและคำถาม



นี่จะเป็นพี่ชายแท้ๆ ของเธอได้อย่างไร



หลังจากผ่านไปนาน เธอพูดเบาๆ: ""เขาเป็นคนขอหย่า""



""แต่เธอก็ต้องรั้งเขาไว้สิ



ตอนนี้มีแต่เขาเท่านั้นที่ช่วยบ้านตงได้ เธอไม่รู้เหรอ""



...

เธอเห็นแก่ตัวแบบนี้ได้ยังไง คิดแต่เรื่องของตัวเอง



รีบกลับไปเดี๋ยวนี้นะ



ถึงต้องคุกเข่าก็ต้องขอให้เขาช่วยบ้านตง""



""No one can help the Dong family.



As long as the Dong family is in her hands, the Dong family will soon fall apart.""



Tong Fei shouted with extreme anger.



Slap!



Tong Chen raised his hand and slapped Tong Fei's face once.



Tong Fei didn't cry or make a fuss, she just looked at her real brother with a puzzled look.



The one who was called the spoiled child since childhood, the eldest young master of the Dong family.



When my parents were still alive, how prosperous was the Dong family in Ancheng?



Just two years



Dong's house fell completely from heaven to hell.



All thanks to this son of a bitch.



They say that people will be rich within three generations. When they come to your house, you believe it.



This is the hardest time for the Dong family, but it is also the most painful time in her life.



And all her real brother could do at this moment was to make things worse for her.



She turned around and prepared to go up the stairs.



Tong Chen stepped forward and grabbed her arm: “Where are you going?



You don't listen to what I say, do you?



Or do you want to be a beggar from today onwards?""



""Brother, I beg you, please let me preserve the last bit of dignity I have left.""



Tong Fei shook off Tong Chen's hand.



Tong Chen ran back to the living room and picked up the landline phone: “Do you think dignity can be eaten?



We'll have to declare bankruptcy soon.



What the hell is dignity?



I don't want that kind of worthless thing. If you don't call, I'll call myself.""



Tong Chen quickly dialed Zhan Tianjue's mobile phone number.



When Tong Fei ran down to snatch the phone, it was already too late.



""Hello, brother-in-law. It's me, Tong Chen. Our house...""



Before Tong Chen could finish speaking, a terrifying voice came from the other end of the line.



""Didn't you watch the economic news today?



From today onwards, I am no longer your brother-in-law.



So now you can call me Chairman Zhan or Second Young Master Zhan.""



The sound from the home phone was very loud.



Even though Tong Fei was standing just a step away, he could still hear it clearly.



Tong Fei closed his eyes and tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart.



""Is there anything I can help with?""



""Well, I believe you know that the Dong family is currently experiencing a financial crisis. I would like to...""



""Enough!"" Tong Fei stepped forward and pushed him to the ground.



She grabbed the phone and immediately put it on the machine.



""Tong Chen, do you still have the nerve?



Didn't you hear what Zhan Tianjue said?



He's telling you that he's no longer part of your family and has no right to wipe your arse for your stupidity.""



""Who exactly is causing these things?



You crazy girl, you still dare to yell at me.



If you hadn't divorced Zhan Tianjue, how could this have happened?""



Finally, Tong Fei couldn't hold it in any longer. She grabbed her forehead with her hand and shouted at the top of her lungs.



""Ahh... Is this all because of me?



It's you, sir. If you learn from your father, how could the Dong family fall apart?



Please, I've been hurt enough.



Don't hurt me any more.""



Tong Chen gritted his teeth: “I don’t care. I don’t want to be a beggar.



Now, only Zhan Tianjue can help us.



I have to find him.



And when she got divorced, how much of his assets did he give her?



Hurry up and bring it all.""



Tong Fei closed his eyes helplessly. ""Can't you see that when I entered the door, I was only holding this? I came out empty-handed.""



""Tong Fei!"" Tong Chen pointed at Tong Fei and shouted angrily: ""She's really crazy!



She married Zhan Tianjue, what did she get in return?

## key Features Analysis

The performance and longevity of a refrigerator water filter determine its value. Here is an analysis of key features often found in Frigidaire refrigerator water filters:

**Contaminant Reduction:** the primary function of a water filter is to remove impurities from your water supply. High-quality Frigidaire filters are designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, particulates, and other contaminants that can affect the taste and safety of your water. Look for filters certified by NSF International to ensure they meet industry standards for contaminant reduction. Specific certifications, such as NSF 42 for chlorine reduction and NSF 53 for lead reduction, indicate the filter's capabilities.

**Filter Lifespan:** The lifespan of a water filter refers to the amount of time or gallons of water it can effectively filter before needing replacement.Most Frigidaire refrigerator water filters are designed to last for approximately six months or 200 gallons, whichever comes first. Monitoring your water usage and adhering to the manufacturer's recommended replacement schedule is crucial for maintaining optimal water quality. Some refrigerators include an indicator light to remind you when it's time to replace the filter.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate measures how quickly water passes through the filter. A higher flow rate provides water more quickly, but it doesn't necessarily mean better filtration. Ideally, the filter should provide a balance between adequate flow and effective contaminant removal.Check the manufacturer's specifications for the flow rate, usually measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A typical flow rate for refrigerator water filters is around 0.5 GPM.**Material Composition:** Frigidaire refrigerator water filters are typically constructed from activated carbon, which is highly effective at adsorbing impurities. The quality and type of activated carbon used can influence the filter's performance.Some filters use compressed carbon blocks, while others use granulated activated carbon. Carbon block filters generally offer finer filtration due to their denser structure. High-quality filters often incorporate multiple layers of filtration to capture a wider range of contaminants.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with your specific Frigidaire refrigerator model is essential. Frigidaire offers different filter models designed for various refrigerator types. Verify the model number of your refrigerator and consult the Frigidaire website or owner's manual to identify the correct filter. Using an incompatible filter can result in poor performance, leaks, or damage to your refrigerator.

## Core Benefits

The use of a quality Frigidaire refrigerator water filter translates into practical benefits for your household.

**Improved Water Quality:** By removing contaminants like chlorine, lead, and other impurities, Frigidaire filters substantially enhance the taste and odor of your drinking water. This not only makes your water more palatable but also safer to consume. Regular use of a filter ensures you're drinking clean,healthy water free from harmful substances.

**Enhanced ice Quality:** Similar to water, ice made with filtered water is clearer and tastes better. Unfiltered water frequently enough contains minerals and impurities that can cloud ice cubes and affect their flavor. A Frigidaire water filter helps produce ice that complements your beverages without compromising taste. This is notably noticeable in drinks like iced tea, coffee, and cocktails.

**Protection of Refrigerator Components:** Sediment and mineral buildup from unfiltered water can damage your refrigerator's water dispenser and ice maker over time. A water filter helps prevent these issues by capturing debris before it enters the system. This prolongs the lifespan of your refrigerator's internal components and reduces the need for costly repairs.

**Cost Savings:** While purchasing water filters requires an initial investment, it can save you money in the long run compared to buying bottled water. The cost of bottled water accumulates quickly,and using a water filter provides a convenient and more economical way to access clean drinking water. Furthermore, by protecting your refrigerator's components, filters can prevent expensive repairs, further contributing to cost savings.

**How often should I replace my Frigidaire refrigerator water filter?**

Most Frigidaire refrigerator water filters should be replaced every six months or after filtering 200 gallons of water, whichever comes first.The exact replacement frequency can vary depending on your water quality and usage. Refer to your refrigerator's manual for specific recommendations.

**How do I find the correct replacement filter for my Frigidaire refrigerator?**

the easiest way to find the correct replacement filter is to consult your refrigerator's owner's manual or the Frigidaire website. Look for the model number of your refrigerator, and then search for compatible filters using that number. You can also find the filter model number printed directly on your existing filter.

**Are aftermarket (non-Frigidaire) filters safe to use?**

While aftermarket filters might be less expensive, it's essential to ensure they meet NSF standards for contaminant reduction. Not all aftermarket filters are created equal, and some may not effectively remove impurities. Choosing NSF-certified aftermarket filters can provide assurance of their quality and performance. Always prioritize filters that meet or exceed the standards set by Frigidaire.

**how do I install a new frigidaire refrigerator water filter?**

The installation process typically involves locating the filter housing, removing the old filter (usually by twisting or pulling it out), and inserting the new filter. Make sure to align the filter correctly and twist or push it into place until it locks. After installing the new filter, flush the water system by dispensing water for several minutes to remove any air or loose particles. Consult your refrigerator's manual for detailed step-by-step instructions.

Hey everyone! I hope you’re having an awesome day. 🌞

I’m practically bouncing in my seat thinking about the massive, almost mind-blowing impact AI automation is having and will HAVE in our day-to-day lives. It's everywhere—from what Netflix recommends to the bots answering customer support at 3am! But what really gets me grinning lately is this: What would work actually *feel like* if so much busywork just... disappeared?

Here’s what keeps popping into my head:

- Imagine a to-do list that actually shrinks itself while you drink your coffee.
- Spreadsheets that magically fill themselves out, leaving gaps only for your wildest, boldest ideas.
- Creative bursts instead of copy-paste marathons!
- Tedious emails, endless paperwork, dull data wrangling… swept away by a helpful AI sidekick.

Just appreciating the freedom that AI automation gives back—like, TIME to *think*, to SOLVE cool problems, to learn stuff we actually care about—gives me pure, goofy joy. 😂

Now, yes, I’ve heard the worries. Of course we have to figure out the job transition thing. We can't and shouldn't ignore that. But also—imagine how much happier we all might be at work if our days were packed with *interesting* challenges instead of monotony.

Here’s the wild part:

- More room for us to discover weird/crazy solutions to big problems!
- Openness to new roles we can’t picture yet, jobs that are literally being invented in real time.
- Sharing success, growing skills, collaborating with amazing people—all supercharged by an AI-powered “easy button.”

Honestly, is anyone else as genuinely stoked as I am to see just how *happy* workplaces could become, long-term, if AI automation cuts out the worst overhead? 

What will we create when we aren’t so bogged down? How will lives change when everyone—not just techies—get the benefits?

I’d love to know your positive, hopeful spins as well as your honest hesitations about AI automation. Who’s already feeling the joy? Where do you think we need to be extra careful?

Let’s dream a little—and plot the path to get there, too. (Add your wildest thoughts, or your favorite hopeful news story, below!) ✨

1mh6nr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh6nr0/the_monster_between_us/,The Monster Between Us,"Leaving this here as a cautionary tale. If there is any disdain or resentment between you and your loved one, please for the love of God work through it. It grows if you don't resolve even the smallest of issues.

My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly seven years. We’re high school sweethearts who started dating during our sophomore year. One thing I wish people had told us from the beginning is how much we both would change in less than a decade. When you're young like we were, you don't consider how time will shape you before tying yourself to someone who makes your heart flutter.

The first year of our relationship was like any other new romance. We couldn’t get enough of each other and wanted to spend every waking moment together or on the phone. We were young, dumb, but happy. The beginning is always the easiest; love outweighs any issues, and you’re blind to red flags.

I had just gotten out of a messy relationship where I’d been manipulated by an older girl into giving up parts of myself I had planned on saving. She convinced me it was God’s will. I was foolish. She ended up cheating on me several times before I finally built the confidence to leave her for good. Needless to say, I brought trauma into my new relationship. I had severe trust issues and became overly protective. I wasn’t willing to risk being hurt again. I also became overly critical of anything my girlfriend did that caused me even mild discomfort or anxiety.

I've always been good at reading the intentions of other guys. She, however, was not. She was naive and friendly to almost everyone and deep down, I resented her for it. How could she be so kind to people she didn’t even know? Didn't she see she was opening the door for potential problems? I see now that the real problem was me.

That’s not to say she was perfect either. She came from a rough childhood. Her parents divorced due to infidelity when she was young, and she suffered serious physical abuse from one of them. She was diagnosed with depression early on. Some of her trauma led to attention seeking behavior and seeking approval from guys throughout her teens, some of which carried over into our relationship.

She also brought physical abuse into our relationship. For about a year, she would slap me in the face or punch me in the ribs or stomach. I’m not afraid to say it hurt. She may have given me a concussion right before a school field trip one day. What hurt more was that she did this in public. I’m a private person. I believe what happens in my relationship is no one else’s business. She, however, had no problem with public arguments or physical aggression.

I remember one argument in class. She was berating me, and I could feel everyone watching. When she reared back to slap me, I caught her hand and yelled, ""I'm sick and tired of this bullshit! Why can’t anything be private with you? If you hit me in front of everyone again, we’re done."" I walked out of class with tears in my eyes.

You’re probably thinking we didn’t belong together. That we were toxic. I wouldn’t blame you. But it wasn’t all bad. We did love each other. Over time, we worked through many of our issues. I became less problematic, and she confronted her trauma. She hasn’t hit me in years and I’ve loosened my grip. We established boundaries; ones we mostly respect now. She stopped dressing for attention and became somewhat more emotionally stable. I learned to trust her more. We helped each other heal.

But we skipped something vital: forgiveness.

The next phase of our relationship started with a serious question: Were we still the people who we had fallen in love with? Had we changed so much fixing our issues that we’d lost what originally drew us together?

I didn’t know. I still loved her deeply. But I had grown complacent. I saw her as a permanent fixture in my life. I no longer feared losing her, and that led me to take her for granted.

I didn’t neglect her intentionally—I just stopped trying as hard. I gained weight, not an extreme amount, but I was no longer the 6’4”, 210-pound man she had fallen for. I now weighed 250, and those 40 pounds weren’t muscle. I didn’t care much for my appearance either, to be honest. College can do that to you.

She also gained some weight, but I still found her stunning. I didn’t really mind. I also didn’t buy her flowers or gifts randomly anymore. I still did well on holidays and birthdays, but the day to day effort faded. That complacency, paired with side effects from her antidepressants, created a new issue between us.

She lost her sex drive. Completely. Meanwhile, mine was overwhelming. Conflict returned. I feared she wasn’t attracted to me anymore or worse, that she was finding intimacy elsewhere. She didn’t understand why her desire disappeared and worried she didn’t love me anymore. We tried to be patient, but resentment quietly grew. Our past issues reemerged and became weapons.

We hurled insults calling each other whores, assholes, cunts, bastards while losing sight of what was building between us. We still tried to love each other. We often calmed down by night’s end. But the damage lingered. Though we said, ""I forgive you,"" neither of us truly meant it. Those old grievances were too satisfying to use.

Eventually, we broke. We became so toxic that she began catching feelings for coworkers and imagining being with them. That shattered me. I hadn’t cried in over five years. I cried then.

We turned cold and distant. Too stubborn to leave, too loyal to cheat, and too broken to fix things. We wore fake smiles for our peers while waging war behind closed doors.

That’s when I first saw It.

I was outside in the middle of the night during a particularly vile one of our arguments when my usual anger and sadness were overwhelmed by a deep, dark feeling. Something heavy had seemingly enveloped the yard and was suffocating my emotions.

The phone went silent as neither of us could speak. The line went dead. I was frozen in place. My heart pounding in my chest was the only sound I could hear but I couldn’t feel it. I felt nothing. A numbness had overtaken my body.

The motion sensor light that had been granting me visibility throughout my pacing and arguing no longer detected my presence, and soon I was left in darkness. The streetlight in the corner of my yard was the only light visible, but it was too far to illuminate my surroundings.

My brain screamed at my body to move, to run, to do anything, even to breathe, but my body refused. It was only when my brain gave up on directing my limbs that I heard the despicable whispering voice in my ear, close enough to feel its warm moist breath on my earlobe.

“You’re always alone,” it said in a low, dark register.

The vibrations from its whisper alone reverberated through my head. As soon as it spoke, my eyes began to water, and tears streamed down my face.

Was I crying? I didn’t feel like crying. I didn’t feel anything. I was fully aware of what was happening, but I had no emotions. Just tears. No hyperventilating, no mumbling, no nothing. My face didn’t even change expressions.

Then I felt it, a hand the size of my torso gently placed itself on my back. It was unusually warm. Its fingers tapped rhythmically along my side. It whispered again, this time in a deceptively warm tone,

“But I will always be with both of you. To guide you. You are my father.”

It was only then that my ears detected another sound breaking through the deafening whisper, my dad was calling my name.

The presence lifted like a strong breeze from around me, leaving my body nearly collapsing onto the ground.

I quickly rushed to my father and tried to tell him what I had just experienced but I couldn’t. As soon as I tried, I could feel the hand across my back reappear.

Instead, my father said, “I just wanted to come check on you before me and your mother go to bed. You’ve been out here for a while. Is everything okay between you and that girl of yours?”

All I could manage to respond was, “Yeah, I’m… we’re okay. Better than ever. I’m heading inside now anyway.”

I went inside to my room and tried calling Rae back. I got sent to voicemail immediately. I called seven more times... nothing. I sent her messages on Snapchat and through regular texts, but they weren’t even being opened.

I was tired. Beyond tired. I was completely exhausted.

The next thing I knew, I woke up with the sun blaring through my window.

Immediately, I searched for my phone and called Rae. She picked up almost instantly.

“Hello, Rae? Are you there? Are you okay?” I said with a shaken voice.

“Yeah, I’m okay... something strange happened last night... I... I don’t know if I can talk about it.”

“It’s okay. I’m gonna come see you, okay? I’ll be there in 30 minutes.”

I hung up the phone and raced over to her house. Once I arrived, I ran up to her door and began knocking.

“Rae, it’s me! Open up, please.”

When she opened the door, I could hardly recognize her. Her hair was greasy and unkempt, her skin was shiny, and she had dark bags under her eyes. It was obvious whatever she experienced last night had not only kept her awake but also drained her physically and emotionally. Her skin was a sickly pale color. Her eyes had a dead look behind them as she stared past my face. She showed no emotion that I was there.

I hugged her tightly, gently sat her down on the couch, and began telling her what I had experienced in hopes of her opening up to me. I was scared that whatever I had encountered would keep me from telling her what happened, like it did with my dad. Luckily, for some reason, it didn’t.

Her eyes sparked somewhat back to life, and her skin regained the slightest color by the time I finished recounting what had happened. I grabbed her hand and begged her to tell me what had happened to her.

This is what she told me:

“I... I was on the phone with you when the lights in the house suddenly got a dark haziness to them. The air felt... thick and humid. Eventually, the dark haze seemed to completely envelop me. That’s when I heard the door open. I could hear its footsteps coming directly towards me. It walked with such determination until I could feel its presence all around me. It felt overwhelming. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. I could barely think. It placed its hand over the top of my head, completely containing my whole head in its hand. I felt its fingers drooping around my face. It pulled my head back and brushed my hair behind my ear. Its voice... Oh God... its voice. It whispered in my ear and said... ‘You’re unlovable.’”

She gripped my hand hard. I could feel her body shaking.

“Its finger kept tapping along my cheek. I could feel my energy draining. I don’t know how long it stayed, holding my head firmly in place. All I could hear was its shallow, raspy breathing. It then said, ‘I still love you. I will never abandon you. You are my mother.’”

Her shallow eyes were now clearly filling with tears. I wrapped her in my arms and tried my best to reassure her that she was safe now. But I myself was unsure.

She told me that it held her like that until the sun began shining through her blinds. She was stuck like that for hours.

I stayed with her for three days after that, tending to her every need. Slowly but surely, she regained her normalcy. We never had any encounter with it during that time. We began to believe that maybe somehow we had hallucinated the whole thing. I mean, what else could it be? We didn’t see anything. Maybe we passed out from anger or exhaustion and had some form of sleep paralysis that just so happened to make us hallucinate this entity that addressed our issues.

It didn’t make sense to us either, but it was all we could come up with. We didn’t fight for an entire two weeks after that, and we didn’t encounter it either. Eventually, we pushed the whole situation into the back of our minds and were back to our status quo of fighting over any little thing.

Only when the fighting returned did I begin to notice a slight difference in our arguments. Tinier things would set us off into big disputes that would turn into name-calling and insults. We were more vicious than we previously were, and it was getting worse with every fight. I could also feel a slight chill down my spine that would grow with every occurrence of hostility.

After a while, it finally returned.

We had just gotten off the phone around 3 a.m., and I was lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling, contemplating the future of my relationship. It was the first time I had ever seriously contemplated leaving Rae. I couldn’t take the constant arguing anymore. My emotions had run thin. I knew I still loved her with all of my heart, but maybe we just weren’t meant to be together.

Then I heard it, a slight tapping on my window. Immediately, the paralysis set in. The tapping got louder. Then it began scratching at the window. I could hear its long, sharp claws slowly scraping down the glass. Then I heard the window unlatch and slowly open completely.

It made no noise as it climbed through the window. The only sign that entry had been made was the thick black mist that filled the room. I could no longer see.

It dragged its finger starting at my foot and slowly moved up my leg. Its finger was long—almost the length of my shin. Once it reached my torso, it stopped in the middle of my stomach before applying pressure with its claw. I wanted to scream. It felt like at any moment it would pierce through my skin and puncture my intestines.

Then my emotions were suppressed, and the fear instantly left my body. I was numb once again.

It leaned into my ear, breathing heavily directly into what felt like my eardrum. It whispered to me softly,

“No one will love you. You’re tainted, wasted, minuscule. There is no hope for you. You are mine. She is mine. You both gave birth to me, and I will consume both of you.”

I thought about resisting.

“There is no point. You are nothing without me. Neither of you could survive without me. Think about the pain you’ve felt. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? That pain... that beautiful, disgusting pain. Do you feel it all over again?”

Instantly, what felt like all the pain and all the negative emotions I’d felt throughout my life filled my body. My stomach knotted, and my body began sweating profusely. My eyes streamed with tears. My ears rang loudly. My heart felt like it was about to explode out of my chest. The pain was overwhelming. It made my skin crawl and my hair stand on end.

“Yes... beautiful... sadness. I can save you... I can save both of you. This pain... this pain is inevitable without... me.”

It slowly removed its finger from my stomach, lessening the overwhelming amount of emotion.

“I love you,” it said as I felt the presence quickly shift back toward the window. The thick black mist slowly faded as it slowly lowered my window back closed. With one final tap on the window, it left me alone, lying there.

I woke up the next morning gasping for air. Before I could even get to my phone to call Rae, she called me. I quickly answered, and immediately she confirmed my worst nightmare.

“It’s back.”

I sped back over to her place. Apparently, her encounter was much less traumatic than mine. She told me that it only visited her briefly and replayed images of her abuse in her head before leaving her with the same disturbing goodbye it gave me.

We sat there in silence for a while, neither of us knowing what to say. Our entire worldview had been so personally ripped away from us, and we were utterly defenseless.

Rae broke the silence first.

“It feeds off our negativity between each other.”

“I know.”

We sat in silence a few minutes longer before I stood up and said,

“We’ve got to figure out what this is. I know you’re thinking we should break up, but I don’t want to. I also don’t think that would save us.”

“Why shouldn’t we? If it’s feeding off of our anger and resentment, then how would that not solve the issue?”

“I just have a feeling that that’s what it wants. We can’t fight anymore. It’s our fault that it’s like this. If we keep fighting, it will keep coming back.”

“I know.”

We left and went to grab something to eat. We decided that I would spend the next two weeks with her. We fought less when we were together anyway.

For the first week, we did really well. We were actively choosing not to fight over little things, like leaving dirty clothes on the floor or forgetting to put the toilet seat down. But it wasn't perfect. We could both tell we still weren't exactly happy, but we were at least coexisting. We finally had hope that maybe we could actually do this, that we had figured this thing out, and that maybe our relationship would be stronger because of it.

But deep down, I could feel that It was still getting stronger. We both could. We just hoped that our lack of fighting could keep It at bay.

It wasn't until the end of the second week that everything fell apart.

We had finally had enough. Our biggest argument yet was occurring. In the middle of all the chaos and violence, we both finally snapped. We broke up.

She screamed, “I can't fucking stand you! Everything I do is a problem! I'm always the problem! It's never you! I'm done! I can't fucking do it anymore! I'm just a fuck up in your eyes anyway!”

Immediately, the lights went off. Just as quickly as she screamed those dreadful words, we both went dead silent. We could feel that whatever power It was trying to achieve, it had done so.

We heard Its thunderous footsteps slam onto the front porch. BAM!

We both froze in fear. Our bodies, not yet paralyzed by the monster, allowed me to sprint toward a lamp in the living room. I quickly turned it on. The light began flickering on and off rapidly, illuminating the room with every flash.

Rae wrapped around my arm and screamed. We stood with our backs pressed against the wall next to the lamp. It began dragging Its long, sharp claw along the outside of the house. The sound was that of nails on a chalkboard. It stopped once it reached the front door again.

Tap... TAP... TAP!

Before our brains could even register the taps on the door, It ripped the door off its frame in an instant and immediately filled the room, staring down at us.

In the flashes of the now even more rapidly flickering lamp, we could see Its face. Its flesh was a pale pink that adhered tightly to its bones. Its teeth were brown and sharp, fixed in a long, menacing grin. Its mouth dripped a steaming black liquid that smelled of sulfur and smoke, burning the floor as it formed a puddle.

It had the horns of a ram growing from where its ears should be, spiraling in a false halo around Its head.

I looked at the giant body that had to slump to fit in the room. Its body was long and slender. If It had been human, It would have appeared malnourished. Long black wings stretched from Its shoulder blades and draped around us in the room. The wings appeared to be molting; feathers shed onto the floor.

Its ribcage was exposed, as if the skin had been pulled back from the sternum to the far side of the ribs. Its blood was thick like syrup and slowly dripped from Its exposed insides.

The room reeked of sulfur and death, a sweet, putrid smell like weeks-old rotten fruit. The sight of It alone caused the death of all hope we had left. We were going to die.

The fear alone was completely and utterly overwhelming. All I could do was scream at It.

“What do you want?! What more could you want from us?!”

It screamed. My ears bled. My brain vibrated inside my skull. Blood poured from my nose and my vision went blurry.

Then It spoke, in a deep, demonic voice:

“I am the End. I am one of many. I am Legion.”

It swung its long, clawed hand toward us. I managed to shield Rae with my body as Its claws caught my back and splayed the skin, exposing my ribs and spine. Its hand sliced the bookshelf next to us, causing books to fall onto the floor. I collapsed to the ground.

The wound across my back sizzled from the heat of Its claws. It hurt too badly to scream, and I barely managed to stay conscious.

Rae quickly came to my side, crying and begging It to leave us alone. It laughed at her words and tears.

With the back of Its hand, It knocked Rae across the room, where she crashed into the destroyed bookshelf. A Bible fell from the remaining shelf and landed open next to her, revealing Isaiah 44:22:

""I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.""

Before I could manage to begin getting back on my feet, It grabbed my leg and effortlessly lifted me into the air. My leg fractured from the force of the monstrosity’s two fingers.

“Your anguish pleases me.”

It released me, causing me to crash headfirst into the floor.

Rae quickly ran to me, grabbing my arm and laying on top of me, holding me in her arms. Her tears dripped from her face, and I could feel them raining down upon me.

“I'm sorry, Jacob. I forgive you for everything. Please don't leave me. Don't die, please. I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you. I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you. Please... please forgive me.”

With what little consciousness I had left, I grabbed her hand and looked into her eyes.

“I'm sorry too. I'm sorry for blaming you for everything. I'm sorry for being so overbearing. I'm so sorry. I forgive you for everything. I love you.”

“I love you too.”

She squeezed me tightly as It laughed deeply at our display of emotion, mocking us the entire time.

“Pathetic.”

It moved toward us with unfathomable speed. We closed our eyes and braced for the end.

Suddenly, the room filled with a piercing light. We heard It scream in agony. I slowly opened my eyes and could barely make out what I saw. It was burning and trying to claw Its way toward us, but something in the light was dragging the demon down through the floor.

In one last effort, It spread Its wings and thrust forward before being slammed down onto the floor. Dazed by the collision, It lost Its grip and was quickly pulled into the floor below.

As soon as It disappeared, the light vanished, and the room fell dead silent.

We sat there, astonished by what had unfolded before us, before quickly snapping out of it. Rae rushed me to the hospital for my wounds.

That's where I am currently. I received seven skin grafts across my back and over 700 stitches. The surgeons and nurses said they had never seen a wound like mine before. Seven millimeters deeper, and my spine would have been severed.

Of course, I came up with some complicated, extravagant lie about how I got my injuries. I could tell by the looks on their faces that they didn’t believe it in the slightest—but it didn’t matter. I had my relationship back. I had my Rae back. We survived, and we had learned to forgive each other.

Anyway, I’m being discharged in an hour. Rae has been by my side during my entire recovery, only leaving to get food and coffee. She looks at me differently now. There’s a sparkle in her eyes that I haven’t seen in a very long time. I think I'll finally propose to her once I've fully recovered.",2,1754291248.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Likewise, if you are wondering whether to trek in the base camp of this beautiful place then, you should keep an eye out for the weather.

The trek to the base camp can be done throughout the year following some measures and techniques. However, Autumn is one of the most popular trekking seasons for trekking to the high altitudes places in Nepal.

Out of the seasons in Autumn October is one of the most pleasant seasons for the trek to the Annapurna Base camp.

October is a season where the amount of rainfall is low, the temperature is not too high nor too low which is suitable for adventurous activities such as trekking.

There’s nothing more beautiful like the magnificence of Annapurna Base Camp Trek in October. Similarly, it gets a lot better with all the classic trails, old-style remote villages, and splendid landscapes.

The season makes everything look grand and fantastic with majestic background scenes. At an altitude of 4130 meters, Annapurna Base Camp offers wonderful views with clear and fresh air.

Similarly, October prevents both monsoon rain and the bitter cold of winter where days are warmer and pleasant with clear skies and clean air. However, the nights are slightly cold with a chilly wind blowing from the campsite but it is bearable.

In October, one can have a majestic view of Annapurna and Machhapuchhre. The trails passing through the forest are covered with spectacular fall foliage which ultimately makes the trek relaxing and comfortable to walk.

On the other hand, rare birds migrate to the region in October to enjoy autumn. October witnesses great weather throughout the month and also the view of unobstructed snow peaks.

If this post seems really recent it’s because dumbass Reddit deletes your posts after 6 months. :/

Hello!
This isn’t my main account, but it’s the one I use for socializing (or at least trying to). That being said I’ve started using this as my main account so it’s kinda cluttered with other bullshit, but I’m trying to clean it out xD

Call me Moon~
I’m a dorky midwesterner with a lot of niche interests. My favorite things in life are nature, animals and music. 

I’m non-binary (afab), lesbian, and I aim to have an androgynous body. Despite identifying as non-binary I consider my gender identity to me a lot more complex, which I’ll explain below. 
I also consider myself transmasc due to my (upcoming) top surgery and hopefully, in the future, a clitorophallus.
I *wont* be going on testosterone.

I consider myself demisexual.
Please— Don’t message me with horny shit, I do not like that. 
I am *not* poly and not interested in anyone who has kids or has been married.

Anyway……….

I’m trying to make lasting connections here!
As of writing this, I’m single. I’m looking for something longterm and serious, not just a fling.
Born in ‘04. Wallflower, socially awkward but around friends I’m pretty outgoing. Super small, regular weight, babyfaced. I look “scary” (exact quote) but I’m very soft and polite lol— I just happen to wear lots of spikes! I look like every lesbian; flannel, ripped jeans, short dyed hair. I like the grungy look as well as the folk-punk aesthetic.
I’ve been described as having cat energy but I’m pretty sure I’m just a flightless bat that screams at things and bumps into windows. My brother says I’m more like a weasel. 
So don’t expect “golden retriever gf” vibes, but also don’t expect “dominant goth gf” vibes either. I’m just a little forest gremlin xD

Obligatory mental illness check: I have autism, adhd, depression and anxiety. I also have BPD but it’s surprisingly well managed. I’m in therapy, medicated and receiving TMS. 


Here’s some info on things I like or any other general stuff about me:

GENDER:
I use the term non-binary, but I also feel comfortable being referred to in a masculine context. I don’t identify as a man, but I’m fine with being called “twink” or “femboy”. I’m also fine with labels like “dyke”, “butch”, whatever. I’m afab and I am NOT on hormones, nor will I ever hormonally transition. 
So am I a girl? No. Am I a boy? something like a boy, I guess. Am I both? No. Am I neither? Yes. I’m a Lovecraftian nightmare.

HOBBIES:
drawing, making stuff like jewelry and costume accessories, foraging, looking for animals, fishing (badly) and hopefully soon I’ll be able to rollerskate. I’m like dollar store Ramona Flowers.
I love farm life and homesteading. That’s my ultimate goal, to have a homestead somewhere in the woods and not be surrounded by people.
I really like looking for animals outside, especially reptiles! I love snakes and lizards. I really love snapping turtles and newts. I’d love to find friends to catch turtles with!
Wildlife rehabilitation is also one of my goals, and I volunteer with animals downtown.
I’m also very interested in bugs and spiders! Exotic pets are my jam! 
When the weather gets nice I forage, especially for mushrooms ^_^

MUSIC: 
Early Punk/Grunge/Alt metal/folk metal/everything. 
Bands I love: X-Ray Spex, Nirvana, The Ramones, 311, MF DOOM, Weezer, Korpiklaani, Finntroll, Caravan Palace. Smashing Pumpkins, Sublime, Queens Of The Stone Age, Gorillaz.
Anything rock from the 90s is probably on my list, especially alt rock or grunge! I like most metal. The only genres I don’t like are emo (besides FOB) and modern pop for the most part. I listen to older music like Michael Jackson and funk music. I also listen to stuff like Fleetwood Mac. I’ll comment a list of all the bands I like. 

SPECIAL INTERESTS: oh boy. 
I love vulture culture and bone collecting. Oddities and taxidermy too! I love bugs and spiders, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and animals in general. I want to be a zoologist and wildlife Rehabber.
My other interests are collecting Breyer horses, stuffed animals, and jojos Bizarre Adventure (specifically part 5. everything else after is meaningless to me. My heart is in Italy.) I can talk about it for HOURS- I have so many headcanons and ideas shshshhs. I love Bruno so much 


OTHER SHIT:
My favorite show is Bojack Horseman, but I also love Moral Orel. As far as movies go, I love Scott Pilgrim (still working through the comics) as well as movies from the 70s, cult classics like Harold & Maude. Love emotional shit, like Jojo Rabbit or Fried Green Tomatoes.
I’m a fan of animation too; prince of Egypt, the lion king, spirit.
I don’t read much anymore but my favorite books are 1984, Blood Meridian, Call of The Wild, Tale Of Despereaux and The Book Thief.

FANDOMS:
Not into any social groups but
I’m a furry (in terms of art and such).
I have a lot of generic edgy OCs and I really like fursuits. other than that, I don’t interact with the fandom much, but I’d love furry friends! That being said, I’m NOT into the nsfw part of the fandom. I’m not weird about it, I just like drawing edgy characters lol.
surprisingly I’m not a gamer.
I like film reviews, psychological stuff, learning about scientific and philosophical things.

I’m also a therian! My theriotype is canine, usually a wolf of coyote. My other theriotypes are a stag, a feral horse, pine marten and a little brown bat. If this weirds you out I getcha- but I don’t make it my whole personality and I’m not weird about it. Most people don’t even know. 

PETS:
This is the most important info obviously xD
5 wonderful cats, 2 dogs, a turtle, a giant goldfish, a fox, and like 30 snails!
…and whatever random animal I decide to take home. I rescued a chicken once. Expect nothing but chaos from me lol. My most recent rescue was a little mouse named Spumoni, bless his soul.
Not a plant parent but I want to be. I don’t know how to keep them alive :( I love moss, though! And mushrooms! 

FOODS:
Useless information again but eh. I like fruits, vegetables, pasta, shellfish, sushi/sashimi and matcha flavored things. Big on tea, not so much coffee but I’m experimenting! 
No allergies so feel free to throw food at me in exchange for compliance. 

DATING:
I like people with dyed hair, piercings, tattoos.
Im really attracted to intelligence and emotional depth. I need to really connect with you before I give you my heart. 

I prefer non-binary afab folks that are not on T, or butch lesbians. 
Potentially willing to try things with someone transmasc though again i prefer those who are not on hormones.
Appearance wise I like a androgynous/masc look, alt style and makeup and healthy body types. Tall or short doesn’t matter to me.

NO:
I don’t smoke. 
I don’t get high besides taking edibles for extreme social anxiety and when I can’t calm down. 
I take normal meds and I firmly believe in science so please don’t rub crystals on me or I may eat them (jk).
I don’t party. At all. Do not bring me to the clurb, either. I don’t drink but occasionally I have limoncello after dinner~
I do not like discussing politics or religion, but I do have my own set of beliefs.
No, I’m not the emo kid from Horton Hears a Who; he is a coward, and I am not a coward.
(I hope someone gets that reference).
I’m not poly.

TO ANYONE HERE THAT HAS A PROBLEM:
I love myself just the way I am, even if I sometimes struggle to remember that. I face problems like every one of us and I do my best to survive. I’m poor, I’m gay, I’m ugly, but I’m free. So please don’t hesitate to suck my goth balls and leave me alone.

1mh6kj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/1mh6kj0/in_the_market_for_a_medium_size_air_compressor/,In the market for a medium size air compressor.,"Hi all, as the title says I'm shopping around for a shop air compressor and of course I'm a little lost. 
I've been looking at these two. 
McGraw 29 gallon 165 PSI 5.3CFM, 
Fortress 26 Gallon 175 PSI, 5.1 CFM
both from Harbor Freight I've also seen this one on Amazon that has higher CFM But lower gallon and PSI

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX6WT3YV?ref=emc_p_m_5_mob_i_atc

I'm a hobbyists wood worker and i love working on my cars so I guess I'm looking for one to power things like DA sanders, small Brad nailers (I don't do a lot of like construction building houses or anything) and paint guns and my air impact I've never used 😤
I  know the ""cheap Chinese air compressors"" and paint guns don't mix well with a budget such as mine. Ideally I wouldn't be painting entire cars in one go. I'd probably do it in sections even if I had a larger one. One fender/door at a time, the hood at one time. Things like that. 
I'd also paint things like coffee tables, desks, and eventually guitars when I commit to that style of wood working. My budget is around that of the more expensive harbor freight one. I know very little about paint guns, but I've heard success out of those cheap ones from Harbor Freight. 

Thank you all in advance for the help.

1mh6j6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh6j6d/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_2_final/,I thought angels were in my walls. (Part 2- Final),"There was a moment as I walked through the front door that I didn’t hear the scratching in the walls, that I thought my forgiveness had cured my haunting, but within a few moments it returned as they registered my arrival. I made my way around the flat and checked the bowls I had left out. *Full, full, full.* All of them were untouched. Clearly these angels didn’t have a taste for cereal. Deciding that there wasn’t much I could do about them, I went about my day. 

I began to pile up my textbooks onto the coffee table, gently pushing aside the bibles I had laid out the night before. Slipping on headphones, I started the assigned reading that I had missed for the last 3 lectures. Every paragraph seemed to drag on and on. I found myself glancing around the room, desperate to focus on anything even remotely more interesting. 

Within half an hour, I had given up, instead choosing to watch a long video on a film I had never watched. *Daniel would have studied. Daniel would have been on top of this*. I tried to shoo those thoughts, but the guilt of failure still sat heavy on my chest. That weight left me trapped watching video after video until my evening slipped away. 

When I finally got up to go make dinner, the stack of textbooks had only served as an eyesore. 

I decided on a simple dinner. I went through the motions blindly, following a pattern I had done many nights before. Heat up the pan, defrost some buns, slice the cheese and the tomato and the- My finger was bleeding onto the cutting board. 

“Ah! Goddammit!” Hissing as my finger began to throb, I shook out the bleeding hand and scurried to the bathroom. The cut wasn’t deep, just enough to bleed all over my sleeve. I rummaged around one-handedly trying to find the old box of plasters. After three different drawers and cupboards I managed to pull out the beaten box. By the time it was secured my finger was only distantly aching. I left the mess of open drawers in the bathroom and quickly hurried back to the kitchen to check the stove. 

Luckily, the patties were still sizzling happily. I went back to my, surprisingly clean,  cutting board and continued preparing dinner. 

“Goddammit.” *No. Please not again*. The voice came from the lounge. I went back to chopping the lettuce. 

“God-” From the hallway this time. I moved my fingers further from the trembling knife in my other hand. 

“Forgive me, for taking the Lord’s name in vain. Amen.” I whispered it to myself, too afraid to try and say it to the angels watching. I could hear murmurs further in the flat, but I couldn’t distinguish what they were saying. I didn’t move my eyes from the lettuce in my hand, studying every drop of water settled on the leaves. I didn’t move until I stopped hearing that murmuring. I went back to preparing dinner in silence. 

After dinner, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling listening to the angels scurry through. *I wonder why they stay in the walls.* The noise kept me wired and awake for a long time. I slowly drifted off thinking about what they did while I slept. 

Rebbekah was already waiting for me as I walked in to my lecture the next morning. I slunk into the seat next to her, shedding my jacket to try and avoid dripping it over my damp clothes. 

“Hey drowned rat, you’re late! You usually get here before me.” She shifted slightly to avoid any contact with the dripping rain, softened with an easy smile. I tried to return it, but it came out more as a grimace. I looked away. 

I zoned out most of the class. Rebbekah would occasionally glance over at me throughout her stories, giving me a look that I hadn’t seen since I first began to attend class with her. A sturdy look, eyes soft and flittering over me. Trying to avoid her prying eyes, I focused further on the lecturer. However her words just flowed directly through my head like water, impossible to grasp. 

“Are you okay?” I hadn’t realised that Rebbekah had been silent for the last however long. Her voice almost startled me. 

“Yeah. Yeah why?” 

“You’re quiet. Which, I mean you’re always quiet, but like you haven’t even been listening which- I don’t know, you just seem off.” I stared for a hollow moment at the crease between her eyebrows. Her eyes drilled into my head the longer the silence went on. 

“Just- Haven’t been sleeping well. The uh- the rats in my apartment again.”

“The exterminator didn’t work? I thought your landlord fixed that ages ago? You should really do something about that. It’ll only get worse.”

“I’ve been trying.” I thought about the bowls of cereal; about my fervent prayers. 

“You need to say something to your landlord. That place has been infested since you moved in which I think means he is not up to code or something-”

“It’s fine. He tried to get rid of them.” I had told him the last exterminator worked. I didn’t want him in my apartment. 

“Well can I at least come over and have a look for you? I got a friend’s brother who works in some sort of pest control so, I mean, he could come help maybe.” The thought of Rebbekah in my apartment, with the angels watching her, sent shivers across my arms. I breathed slowly through my teeth. 

“ No, no, I don’t want to bother him. It’s fine.” Rebbekah didn’t look convinced, her foot tapping agitated against her seat. 

“Marnie, you can’t live in a rat overrun apartment. You’re gonna get, like, a flesh eating disease or something.” She twisted her bracelet between her fingers over and over. “It would make me feel better if I could at least see how bad it’s gotten.” Her voice turned soft. It was the same tone she used when she first met me. That sickly sweet pitying tone that lit my insides in shame and rage. 

“I don’t need your help, Rebbekah. Just cause you couldn’t save Daniel doesn’t mean you can hover over me.” The air between us froze. The lecturers droning voice sat in the space like static. Rebbekah turned away for a moment, lips pursed firmly, eyes downcast, glassy. My insides turned to lead gravel and churned. I tried to say something, anything, to patch up the rift that I had just torn through us, but I just gaped softly in an attempt to form an apology. 

“I didn’t realise I was-” She paused, her lip wobbling as she searched for the word. “Overstepping. Sorry for worrying about you. No, wait.” She pressed her nails against her lips, mocking chewing them like a kicked habit. “That was mean. I know I've been a bit protective or whatever. I didn’t realise it was affecting you. I just worry, with you being alone, after your brother.” She continued to fake her nail biting as her eyes flicked between me and the lecturer. 

“No, I'm sorry. That was- You were trying to help. Sorry” Guilt burned through my blood, pooling in my chest. *How could I yell at her? She was trying to help. She’s my only friend. God, it really is in my nature.* “Do you want to come over this week? We could study or something.” Rebbekah held my eyes a little longer before glancing away again. 

“Okay. Thank you. That sounds nice; We haven’t hung out in a while.” Rebbekah spent the rest of the class uncharacteristically quiet as she soaked in the charged air. I spent the rest of it picturing Rebbekah as a dark spot on my living room carpet. 



As soon as I rushed through my door, I quickly began hopping about in a fruitless attempt to avoid dripping rain all over the floor. My shoes thudded against the wall by the door where I flung them. Stumbling through to the living room, I dropped to my knees next to the couch. 

“Forgive me. Please forgive me. I-” My mind was racing too fast for me to pull my thoughts into a sentence. “I didn’t mean to yell at her. She was- She was only trying to help.” My eyes darted around at the walls, listening for any creak or groan that might sound like forgiveness. “I didn’t mean to say that. I never mean it.” I don’t know if they could hear me as my voice grew quieter and quieter. “I don’t know why I think these things, or why I say them.” It came out as a whisper, barely audible even to myself. I stayed there. I listened for any noise in response. 

My knees began to ache from where I sat but I stayed. Kept my hands clasped in my lap and waited. And waited. And waited. But nothing happened. For the first time in a long time my apartment was silent and still. I stayed there, trembling arms clasped together, and knees throbbing against the bald carpet, and when the feeling of being watched never came, I stumbled up to my feet. 

Hesitantly I walked away. My stomach turned from the uncertainty. I walked past the kitchen and straight to bed. Curled up in my nest of tangled blankets, I continued to pray in my head. 

The silence lulled me through into sleep. 

Blinking through the haze of sleep, I was surprised to find my face pressed against rough carpet. An odd ache was present in my ankle. An ache, like a cold hand curled around it. My foot brushed up against a cool solid surface. In fact my whole body was chilled without my blankets. 

Being tugged across the floor was what shot me into consciousness. 

In an instant, I registered my hair dragging through the washing on my floor; The sensation of being held upside down, blood pooling towards my head. My drowsy body struggled to flail, arms moving thickly through the air. Whatever was dragging me had its hands curled around my entire leg, reaching up my back slowly, stroking and reaching for the rest of my body. I darted my eyes around the room, but I couldn’t see a thing in the darkness. My hands reached to pull off whatever was holding me. 

“Agh! Ah! Wha-” I was gasping, short, sharp sounds leaving me involuntarily as I struggled. Whatever it was, I couldn’t reach it. 

I was tugged harshly, pain beginning to radiate up my leg, and I was fully upside down. Scrabbling at the wall didn’t help. Whatever it was, it was strong. Quickly trying to escape I dropped my body, my back hitting the wall hard. By touch I scrambled to find anything. Brushing up against something solid, I grabbed it and flung it hard into the wall. My metal drink bottle thudded loudly. Whatever had my leg seemed to, in a humanlike moment, flinch. 

It released. It felt like hundreds of bugs skittering over my skin. My head hit the floor hard, my neck cricking badly as I crumpled into the carpet. I stumbled, my body fighting against me as I forced it up, and managed to slam on the lightswitch. 

Every corner and nook was like an eye watching me. I tried all I could to stare back at each one. All of them were empty. Locating where I had been dragged, found by the dent in my drywall, I tracked up to where I was going. The hole in my ceiling, from the leak last year. Where I always felt angels staring at me. My lip wobbled, poised between emotion, before stretching out into a toothy grin. Tears pooled in my eyes.. Dropping to my still aching knees I stared up at that little hole and cried like I had never cried before. I was going to Heaven. 



I woke up atop my duvet. My head pounded and my eyes ached, as if I had spent the night blackout drunk instead of sobbing on my bedroom floor. The apartment was dead silent. *They’re gone. I passed.* Giddy joy raced up through my chest, pulling at my cheeks and eyes. I almost felt like crying again. My duvet pooled around my hips as I pulled myself up to start this clean new day. 

The sun was streaming in through the curtains as I dressed, bravely donning a yellow crewneck that had sat for a long time in the back of my wardrobe. It felt good to walk through my apartment without hiding. I stepped out into the sunny lounge and for the first time since I left my childhood home, I felt hopeful. The dark spot was still there on my couch, but I decided to just pull down the blanket over it. *I’ll have to clean that at some point.* The bright day still continued to shine through the windows. I ended up moving to my couch to decide how to spend the day. Before I could think too much about it, my phone began to ring in my hand. 

“Hello?”

“Hey sweetie!” My mum’s cherry voice crackled through the phone, sounding almost distant, as if she was standing away from the receiver. 

“Hi, Mum. How are you?”

“Good good. Very busy as usual! How about you? Working hard?”

“Yeah, been studying a lot.” I lied. 

“You work so hard! Just like your brother. Be sure to take a break every now and then.”

“Don’t worry, I take care of myself.” With my free hand I picked at a loose thread in my jeans. 

“Oh, you have class today don’t you, so I better leave you then. Just give me a ring if you have time, okay? I like to know how you’re doing.” 

“Okay. I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.”

“Love you too. Bye now.”

My phone beeped as I hung up. I felt a little guilty lying to her about my classes, but I was determined to not let it ruin my day. Deciding then, I went to put on my coat and walk out in the sun. 

Stepping out, it felt warmer than it had in weeks. The sun kissed over the only bare skin on my face. Although despite its warmth I could still feel the chilled wind nip at my nose and ears. I picked the same path as last time, hoping to rewrite the memories of that desperate escape to the church. 

It was a beautiful day. Rays of light cast dappled shadows over the concrete and I now saw the autumn colours scattered through yards like a mosaic. Ever since last night it was like I had stepped into a new world. Like I had stepped into Heaven now that I knew I wasn’t damned. 

The church rose into view the same as it had days prior. There were still a few lone fogged up cars sitting in the carpark, and still skeletal trees stretched up around it. I stopped for a moment to just look, but this time, I walked on past. Instead I walked on to a local corner store. It was quiet, the only other customers I saw as I approached was a father shepherding his kids out with fistfuls of packaged candy. I scooted past the excited kids and into the store. 

Down the back of the store, I wandered to the fridges of chilled drinks, taking my time to browse the rows of colourful aluminium cans and plastic bottles. *I think I deserve a little something. After all that shit*. Eventually, I picked out a soda with cute packaging and slowly made my way to the counter, glancing through the rows of sweets along the way. After paying, I found a spot to sit on a metal ledge against the wall and took a moment to sip my drink in the sun. 

Eventually, I made my way back home. As I crossed onto my street, I checked my phone and found a text from Rebbekah. 

*May come over today to study. Be home. Also what snacks you want*

*1 hr ago*

*Oops.* My pace sped up as I went to meet Rebbekah. However, as my apartment came into view, I thankfully couldn’t see her car outside. I dug through my coat pockets for my house key as I juggled my bottle of soda and focused on not tripping. Pulling out my keys, standing on my front door step, I unlocked the door and went to step in but noticed something had stuck to my shoe. I looked down to scrape whatever it was off but it wasn’t on my shoe. It was on my doorstep. A large pool of something dark red and half dried. My stomach lurched and I nearly found myself throwing up on my shoes. *God please. Not again. I thought I was good.* My vision began to blur. Before I could pass out I flung open the door. 

Racing through the hall, leaving a grisly trail of sparse, disgusting spots, I grabbed the first thing I could find. I pulled the mink blanket from the couch, stumbled through the hall, and flung it over the pool. Dropping to my knees, I scrubbed at the mark. Most of it had already dried. My fingers cramped around it, gripping the fabric until my knuckles were white. I could feel the glassiness of my eyes, drying and tearing in the cold wind. The blood wasn’t coming off. 

At some point I could no longer feel my fingers, and my knees were beginning to regain feeling; a scraping, aching pain. I left the blanket on the doorstep covering the puddle. Closing the door felt like pulling shut a coffin. 



I locked down my house. If the angels wanted to deal with me then no one else needed to be involved anymore. My phone went into the bottom drawer of my dresser, underneath the folded shirts. I didn’t want to know if it was Rebbekah that had been on my doorstep. The curtains were drawn and would stay drawn for as long as this would take. After my doors were locked, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I sat alone on my couch, next to the remains of Brandon, with a half drunk bottle of soda on the coffee table. I waited. Waited for anything to happen. Maybe I should be scared at the prospect of going to Hell, but at the time I wasn’t. I didn’t feel much of anything. I just stared and stared at the bottle sitting on the table and waited. 

As I sat there in silence, eventually something moved. A little shadow in the corner of my eye. Looking up, it had already skittered away. I would have dismissed it had I not heard the scratching of something on the floor as it went. My hands began to gently tremble where I had them folded in my lap. Another one flittered through my vision deep in the dim light of the kitchen. It was too far and too quick to identify. The skin of my lip broke under my teeth. 

“It’s okay. You can take me now. I know what I did wrong.” My voice was cracking under the weight of the words. There was almost a relief in them though. 

The angels, as always, said nothing. Another one peeked from around the doorway to the hall for a moment. 

They made me wait. I stayed still, still as I could. I didn't move from where I was sat, and I waited. And waited. More and more they would flitter through my house; I could hear them scratching over the floors, but they never came near me. The light was beginning to dim through the curtains when I became restless. Every moment I waited, the guilt and fear built up in my chest. My lip was bloody and the holes in my jeans picked through. *Is this part of the punishment?* My body ached from how taught I held my muscles, and the anxiety that was trembling through me. 

I thought about my Mum. I wish I could have said goodbye. I wish I could be there to comfort her through the loss of her last living child. At the thought of her I could feel my eyes becoming wet, at the thought of her soft hands, her smile lines and crows feet, and her lively voice crackling through the phone. 

*I should have called her more*. 

An angel skittered through the kitchen door, stopping for a moment, almost long enough for me to look at it, but it fled again before I could clear the blur of tears. I rose from the couch,  knees cracking loudly in the silent house. 

“Why aren’t you taking me?” It came out hushed. I cleared my throat and rose my voice to be heard. “I admitted that I’m damned. The judgement is over, why aren’t you taking me to Hell?” Angel’s clattered around the house, now whispering amongst each other. I could hear fragments of what I had said repeated back. Mindlessly I moved towards the kitchen. The angels I could see scattered away as I approached.

“Do I need to confess? What do I need to do?” 

They whispered back; *What do- I need- What do-* The guilt and fear was churning in my chest, slowly turning on itself again and again. It hurt. The angels peeked around corners like they were listening.

“Please just tell me. You don’t need to punish anyone else, just me.” Again all I heard was hushed voices amongst the tapping of small feet and peeking heads. That feeling in my chest began to burn. It burned through my chest, into my arms and behind my eyes. 

“What do I do?!” I snapped. The angels skittered at the loud noise, shuffling back into their dark corners. 

“Just tell me what to do!” My chest ached. If they came back, I wouldn’t know; I could barely make out those judgmental figures through the blur of tears. The frustration began to burn hotter.

“Ple-e-ea-se!” I could barely draw a breath to form the words, blocked in my chest and throat. All they did was watch. They didn’t care. At this point, after those bloodstains, I didn’t either. The thought of the people who had been punished in my place stuck like a tack in my chest.

The bar stool had cracked through the drywall before I knew I picked it up. Splinters sprayed across the linoleum. My fingers ached as they clenched what was left. All eyes were on me. It clattered on the floor as I threw it down. I had definitely got their attention. The angels seemed to be peeking from behind every corner, doorway, and open cupboard. 

“It was my envy, right?! Because I hated Daniel?! I know, okay! I hate myself for it!” My face was wet and I could barely breathe between the guilt and rage clogged in my chest and the pathetic snuffling of my crying. “Please, I know, and you can punish me for it! I know I’m a bad person, I’ve known for a long time, but I’m confessing it! I confess that I was relieved when he died so I wouldn’t have to live in his shadow! I confess that I wished he would die for years! I confess that I hated him! It’s my fault! Let me be punished!” My throat felt shredded, as if the words themselves were tearing out of me as much as it felt like they were. 

The angels whispered endlessly. They made no move to drag me to Hell. They just watched and watched and watched as they judged my sins. I trembled under the hot anger flushing my face. I grabbed whatever was in reach and smashed it. Something shattered across the wall. 

“Do something!” My voice was raw. Everything felt raw. A university branded mug shattered into a burst of ceramic shards. There was no satisfaction in its destruction. Just a growing feeling of exposure. 

“Fucking university. I only went to make Mum proud since her pride and joy couldn’t achieve anything ever again.” The shards crackled under scurrying feet. “ I bet she wishes I died instead.” I said the words, but under the rage, I didn’t believe them. But my rage didn’t care. My other barstool was shoved to the floor where it lay pathetically. 

“Just punish me already!” Something inside me bubbled over and my hand buried itself inside my drywall, dark creatures scuttling out like insects. The pain radiated up my arm, jumping through me. Hissing, I pulled my fist away, blood and crumbling drywall dropping to the floor. The small cut on my knuckle was enough to shock me out of the haze I had been in, and in a moment all my anger melted back. As if I had just woken up, I was suddenly aware of the mess of shards and glass that littered the floor. My face was wet and my throat hurt. Throbbing pain shot through my hand. Looking back to the jagged hole in my kitchen wall, there were no insects pouring out as I had imagined. 

Though no one was there to see it, I felt ashamed of the state. 

I curled up, crouched over the mess, and I sobbed. It was like I was floating, every sin I had carried was pulled out of me, and I could feel the weightlessness of that burden. It was nice. But it was also like a part of me had left, and left behind a hole. But for now I just hoped maybe I had been relieved of my judgement. 

I cried hard into my hands. Everything I had been holding back for the past few days, my endless grief over Daniel, my guilt, all of it bubbled up in that moment, and I could not stop crying. It spilled out and out and out; over my face and spilling into my hands. I crouched there, sobbing so hard it began to echo throughout the house. 

From down the hall, I heard each of my own sobs, off-beat and hushed. My crying began to trickle into hitches of breath as I registered it wasn’t me I was hearing. They were in the hall. They were still here. I wasn’t even angry at this point, I just felt so tired. The glass crunched under my heels as I stood, impaling into my dirty sneakers I still hadn’t removed from my walk. The doorway to the living room felt impossible. Everything fell silent. There was a moment, where my breath was held and the air was as tense as I was; then a horrific reflection of my own face appeared from that doorway. 

I registered it was meant to be my face, but everything about it was wrong. Its eyes seemed to be melting from its head. The body jerked around the corner like an amateur’s marionette, struggling to move through its impossible proportions. Despite the sniffling half sobs coming from somewhere inside it, it conveyed no expression and its mouth stayed glued shut. I was frozen as I tried to register what this horrific doppelgänger was. Shambling across the glass, it didn’t even seem to register any sort of pain as it slowly moved closer and closer. 

Finally, my senses caught up to me. I scrambled backwards, skittering over glass until my back hit the edge of the counter. It continued to amble closer, seemingly knowing it would get to me in its own time. I was pinned in the kitchen. I had to move. As it’s gnarled hands reached out towards me I dropped to the floor, clambering across the ground and stumbling out to the lounge, nicks cutting into my hands and knees. Glancing back, it turned, slowly, its uneven eyes struggling to follow me as they rolled around in its head. Scrambling for anything, my head whipped around looking for something, some way to save myself. As soon as it left my sight, it pounced. 

My head cracked against the floor as we thudded into the carpet, rolling around and scrabbling against each other like animals. My nails caught and bent against the strange folds of the creature, where its soft peach rind skin had tried to form clothes. I struggled to shove it off, hands slick with sweat. It wasn’t coordinated, more slapping and wriggling as it struggled to puppet its body, but it was strong, and dense. Grunting, I managed to catch my hips enough to throw it off, and fumble back away from it on my hands until I hit the coffee table.

It seemed to fight against itself for a moment. Its limbs, appearing devoid of muscle, floundered under it as it attempted to push itself from the floor. Its useless eyes stared out at me from the warped version of my face, a blank unreadable expression and it’s empty maw of a mouth gaping open and closed. 

Everything in me was trembling. Sweat and tears dripped into my eyes. The doppelgänger limply rose, its neck twisted and its head drooping over its chest. 

*Huff huff.* It was mimicking my panicked breaths. 

“Do some- Do something.” My own voice, in a desperate rasp, choked out from it, muffled from within its body. I couldn’t help but sob in horror. I clawed at the floor as I crawled back towards the kitchen, out of the corner I had been backed into. It caught my ankle. Kicking and gasping, I fought against its bruising grip. It did not let go. It tugged at my leg, attempting to drag me to it, but unable to devise using it’s other hand. 

“An okay- an ok-y host. Host. Okay host.” It blabbered on and on. The grip on my ankle was so strong, it felt as if I could feel my bones creaking. The sobs from my chest were uncontrollable now. It was so strong. 

*I don’t even know what this is. I can’t do this. I can’t, I can’t, I don’t want to. God, please just let it stop.* It was hopeless. 

The creature yanked me back, clambering up my body on its unsteady limbs. I let go of the handfuls of carpet I had been gripping and clutched at my face, smearing tears across my cheeks and into my hair. A jolt of searing pain raced up my leg as small mouths dug into my flesh. Through the blur of tears I could see my own face buried into my leg with blood smeared across the many pairs of strange protruding mandibles, like bugs tearing into an overripe fruit. 

It was painful. The most pain I had ever felt. Now that it had got me, it reveled, tearing out bloody chunks of my leg muscle. I lay pinned, writhing and hiccuping beneath it, the same way I had when I broke my ankle falling from a tree when I was 12. More than anything, more than I wanted the pain to stop, I wished Daniel was there like he was when we were 12. As my vision spotted, I tried to picture him crouched next to me, hoarsely calling for mum and patting my muddy hair. I tried to feel his bony hand clutching my fingers through the overwhelming waves of pain. The tearing sound was drowning out his cries for help. 

Daniel had always been better than me. Where I had been spiteful in my envy, he had always cared for me. He hadn’t let go of my hand the whole way to the hospital. I may be an evil person, but Daniel never was. He would have told me to keep going. He wouldn’t have wanted me to give up and follow him. He would have forgiven me. 

I could almost feel his gentle fingers clutching my hand as I reached back, grasping with shaking hands the bowl of cereal that was still on the living room floor. It shattered as it collided with the creature’s head, splintering apart in my hand. 

It’s head seemed to dissolve, bug sized *things* skittering in all directions over my mangled leg. I used my numb arms to scramble back, smearing blood over the carpet, and tried to pull my leg from under it. Agonising pain shot through me like fire from a simple movement, but I kept trying, eventually pulling it free as I slid through the pools of blood. The thing was now half formed, struggling to keep whatever was making it up from skittering away as well. It was somehow more grotesque than when I had first seen it, now just a jaw sitting atop the neck, and its skin shifting and crawling. 

My back hit the wall, but I kept shuffling back, trying in vain to phase through and away from that creature, but all I could do was pull my legs in tight, having to manually pull what remained of the bloodied one towards me with my hands. The feeling of my own muscle flexing uselessly under my fingers still aches through my hands from time to time. 

Those bug-like things dispersed faster and faster, and what was once my doppelganger seemed to almost dissolve with it, jerking and twitching. Some of them skittered towards me, trying to get at my open wound, but as I yelped, they would run off; a lot less brave on their own. 

As my nightmare collapsed into nothing, along with it went my strength. My writhing shuffle slowed into shaking. Afraid to close my eyes, I continued to watch lifelessly as the last creatures skittered back away into the walls, and for a long time after I stayed there with my eyes open. After seeing something like that, after spending the last few weeks in a paranoid daze only to be proved right in a way, it’s hard to know what to do next. *Alright. Just break it down.* 



I don’t remember much of the after. Now that I’m back in that flat I can piece it together. I don’t remember it, but there's a blood trail from where I had huddled up against the wall all the way through to my dresser of my room. The bottom drawer is still open and my clothes are pulled out all over the floor. I must have called for help because I remember flashes of a hospital bed and a paramedic leaning down through the ghostly, bright lights asking my name. I know I didn’t tell them anything because Rebbekah told me she had to describe me to the nurses at reception. She had shown up to my flat to study, only to see the ambulance leaving and several cops milling around dumbfounded at my door. I still wonder who that stain was. Every night I apologise to them but I wish I had a name to pray for at least. 

Rebbekah dropped me off here today. I know she still desperately wants to know what happened that night, but I don’t know if I could explain it to anyone. I guess that’s why I’m writing this down. I just need it to be out there, but it must stay in this house. I just came to get my things. From here, I’m going back to my Mum for a bit. I don’t know from there, but at least I’ll drop by Daniel. Now though, I need to call my mum.

1mh6ie2,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1mh6ie2/royal_caribbean_family_stateroom_took_75_hours_to/,Royal Caribbean “Family” Stateroom – Took 7.5 Hours to Get My 5-Year-Old a Bed,"We’re currently on Independence of the Seas with my wife and our 5-year-old daughter. I booked a family stateroom with a window.

When we got to the room, the pull-down bunk bed was still up. I asked about it and was told it’s “not for under 6 years old.” Fair enough, but then things went downhill fast.

Over the course of five separate visits to customer service, I was told:

	•	My daughter should just sleep in my bed.

	•	We should push the small sofa against the wall so she doesn’t fall out (she's longer than the sofa).

	•	I should sleep in the bunk bed while my wife shares our bed with our daughter.

	•	They’d remove the sofa and coffee table and bring in a rollaway bed (which never happened until I chased it myself grabbing an actual helpful housekeeper walking the halls).

Eventually, I had to track down a housekeeper personally to get a rollaway bed. But they left the sofa in place, meaning there’s zero room next to beds and currently looks like tetris the beds.

To top it off, I was told I should have paid extra to “pre-book” the room to guarantee my daughter a bed in a family stateroom, no less.

From boarding to finally getting her bed set up, it took 7.5 hours.

This was exhausting and definitely not the start to our trip we expected. Has anyone else run into this issue with Royal Caribbean and “family” rooms?

Worth noting during my numerous trips to CS I found other families similar issues no beds for their kids and/or pull down bunks not pulled down and setup.

1mh6id2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh6id2/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_1/,I thought angels were in my walls. (Part 1),"I was never really religious. I was raised catholic, same as my mother, and her mother; grew up going to church, singing in the back row of the school choir, but it never really sunk in for me. The only time I understood the fear my mother felt was leafing through her yellowing children’s bibles. The idea of those angels, with so many rolling eyes and golden bodies, being able to see me. My brother would make fun of me for it, but I hid under the covers every time I read them so those colourful paper angels wouldn’t see me look at them in fear. 

I stopped attending church when I moved away to university.

When this all began, I believed my dingy apartment was infested with rats. The place was cheap, and already had a serious mold problem.  I began to wake up in the night to scratching in the walls. I called my landlord, who called exterminators, who came in and went with no help. Nothing was ever caught in the traps I put out, and for a while I thought maybe I had some sort of overworked student psychosis until my friend Rebbekah suggested we move to the library study rooms. 

As someone who couldn’t afford another place so close to campus, I began to just try to live with it, as any other student would. It was after I came home from my home town, after the anniversary of my brother Daniel’s death, that it switched from rats to angels. I don’t know why I thought it, most likely a mixture of grief and sleep deprivation, but once the thought entered my head it never really left. In the moment it made sense. It was simply my own actions catching up to me, and they were preparing for my judgement. 

Maybe that little thought in the back of my head was why I let Brandon stay on my couch. Brandon, who had fought with his girlfriend. My tall, rat-like, coworker who always spoke too loudly and far too long. And maybe a part of me felt guilty for wishing his girlfriend would leave him already, even if I didn’t say it. Maybe it was because he reminded me of my brother. Maybe I thought it would make me a good person. Whatever it was, now Brandon was lying on my thrifted, once strawberry red, couch with my $15 dollar mink blanket. 

“Well, goodnight. Just wake me up if you like get cold or need something. The rats can be a bit noisy but- They don’t really do anything.” I stood like a stranger at a party in my own living room. 

“Alright. Glad I won’t wake up with some rat running over my toes then.” Brandon tossed the blanket over him. “Can you turn the lights off on the way out? I dunno where the switch is.” He was scrolling through his phone as he spoke. 

“Sure. Night.” Flicking the lights out, I left the room. 

Lying in bed, I listened to the rats scurrying through the wall. They seemed a bit livelier than usual. Perhaps they knew someone else was in the house. But if I really was being judged, it could wait until morning.

The sun awoke me. It gently shone through the thin curtains against my eyelids. I lay there a while, basking in the quiet, soft awakening. Part of me hoped that Brandon had made up with his girlfriend in the night so I could enjoy my peaceful morning. 

Eventually, the assignments in the back of my head drove me out of bed. Quietly I shuffled up, and down the hall to the lounge. I pressed the handle softly, toeing open the door to avoid potentially waking Brandon. 

Peeking in, the room was dimly lit. The sunlight was shining through the curtains, leaving the room in a warm haze. The couch was empty. Stepping in, I quickly glanced around. Perhaps he had gone to the bathroom, or to raid my kitchen. I picked up the mink blanket that lay in a heap next to the couch, quickly folding it into squares. Propping the blanket onto the back of the couch, I saw it. Some dark puddle was pooled on the couch cushions. It was dry, already having stained into the fabric, and a rich colour. 

“Brandon?” The name echoed dully through the room. “Brandon? Are you okay?” Not even the rats made a sound. My chest became tight as I tried to calmly search the apartment. The bathroom door was open and empty. *Maybe he really did make up with his girlfriend in the middle of the night.* The front door was still locked, as I left it. 

“Brandon?” The kitchen was clean, just the same dishes drying from last night’s dinner. My shoulders cradled my jaw as I wandered back to the lounge. He was just gone. As if he had vanished into another world. The dried blood stared back at me. My breath was coming shorter and shorter. I could see my eyes wide and glossy in the black reflection of his cellphone sitting on the floor. What could have happened? Surely, rats couldn’t have done this. That was absurd. The front door was still locked, all the windows closed, and I had slept like a baby all night, and Brandon was just gone. The glowy haze felt suffocating. I stared into that bright light streaming through the windows, as if that inky black spot would just vanish like he had if I tried hard enough. My eyes slowly drifted up with the sunlight. I could only think in colourful fading pages. 



I don’t know how long I stayed stuck there. My limbs were heavy. Black spots flickered through my vision, swimming through the golden light. Black spots, black spots. Brandon did not appear from any corner of the room as I waited. The haze lifted eventually. My body ached as I stumbled through the dark room. Quietly I changed clothes, brushed my hair, packed my bag, and left the apartment. I locked the door on that dark spot in my living room. 

I was an hour early for my lecture. The wind was cold so I waited in the hallway for the current lecture to finish. Occasionally some harried student or self important tutor would wander by, but they paid no mind to me. I stayed huddled from the cool draft against the wall, cupping my hands in front of my flushed face like some victim. Where I sat, the oil heater dug into my back but I didn’t feel the need to move. It was too much effort to move my leaden limbs anyway. 

Thankfully, the lecture room cleared soon enough. Students flooded out in streams, a wave of chatter and bodies. Managing to stand, I was shuffled against the wall further as wired young adults and scruffy book bags brushed against my arms. As they dissipated off to their flats and study rooms I finally moved through to the theatre. My class wasn't for another half hour, but the room didn’t have a draft like the hall did. The quiet was disconcerting after the morning. I kept expecting to hear the scuffle of rats that I had grown used to. If they were even rats at all. *Don’t think about it.* But the sparse silence of the theatre didn’t leave much for me to think about instead. I glanced around at the posters littering the walls. *Looking for participants! Study in anxiety amongst young adults.* A diagram of the muscle structure. *How grief effects you.* A poster for a guest lecture on head trauma. *Free lunch for all students. Meeting at First Church on Knox Street.* The desk suddenly became much more interesting. The grain flowed right. A knot near the top edge to my left. Three chips on the edge, two next to each other, one on the other side of my body. A darker patch in a blob-like st- 

“Marnie!” I jumped back. Rebbekah appeared at my side. “Ah! Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. Real focused on that table huh?” I glanced back down at the table. I could no longer find the stain. 

“Uh, sorry just” Shaky breath out. “Lost in a daydream I guess.”

“Okay.” Rebbekah flopped into the seat next to me, immediately spreading her stationary all across the table. “Man, I totally did not watch the last, like, four lectures so who even knows what this is about.” 

I couldn’t tell her if I wanted to. Rebbekah didn’t seem like she wanted to find out anyway as she immediately launched into a lengthy story about a man she had met at a party over the weekend. I stayed silent, watching her speak. 

Her curly maroon hair bounced every which way as she spoke, exaggerating every word. Her hands swung wildly, painting an abstract picture of this mystery man. The faded cord bracelet Daniel had given her bobbed on her wrist. Every time she spoke, she became completely lost in her own words. It was one of the reasons I just listened. The other was that I couldn’t stop her even if I tried. 

Even as class began, the lecturer’s words seemed to only be a breaker between her story. Soon I too found myself pulled into the world revolving around this claiming to be 6’4 man and his escapades amongst the very cramped house party. 

As she spoke and spoke, the events of this morning became more and more like a dream. He probably did leave in the night. Probably left his phone in the rush. The room was dark and it was early. 

As we walked out of the stuffy lecture theatre, It felt like nothing had ever happened. Rebbekah pealed off towards the library and the rest of the walk home was spent quietly. 

Arriving at the door is what snapped me back into the horrors of the morning. I hesitated to unlock it. Maybe if I never go in, it never really happened. My fingers began to hurt as the keys cut into the cold flesh. The keys seemed to jingle so loudly as I swung open the door. *Nothing happened. Brandon left last night. Just go inside.* I stepped in quickly and shut the door behind me. Walking briskly through the house, I went about putting away my coat, dropping my bag onto the bed, and taking off my shoes. *Shower, shower sounds good. Warm up.* I grabbed a towel from the edge of the basket and wandered through to the bathroom. My eyes skimmed past the yawning entrance to the living room. 

The shower was just what I needed for both my nerves and chilled skin. Warm steam seemed to flow right through my throat and lungs, soothing and gentle. Soaking in the heat, I began to feel the goosebumps fading and my fingers gently ached. The sound of the water pattering against the shower floor was a comforting background noise. *Wait*. Beyond the white noise of the water was a sound. Scratching. *Just rats.* Relieved, I went back to scrubbing through my hair, foamy trails slithering down my face and forcing me to close my eyes. I tried to ignore the scratching, to pretend it was just another layer of splashing water. My hair fell in a thick sheet as I rinsed it under the stream.

“C-n yu trn mmm” Whatever noise it was murmured under the water. I quickly opened the shower door. Goosebumps rose over my arms. The water splashed loudly on the plastic floor and the walls scratched and creaked, but I couldn’t hear any intruder walking through the hallway. 

“Can you turn off the lights-“ Brandon’s voice was right outside the door, sounding like the very night he vanished. I nearly smashed into the floor stumbling up out of the shower. Swinging open the door, towel clutched around my body, I was faced with an empty hall. 

“Brandon? Brandon, where have you been?”  My breath was catching amidst whatever was stirring in my chest. 

“Brandon?”

“Can you-“ His voice had moved towards the living room. Swinging open that door led to yet another empty room. The blanket still lay folded on the couch from this morning. Brandon’s phone, lit up with notifications, still lay unmoved on the floor. The only signs of life were my own wet footprints leading into the room. 

“Brandon? Did you go somewhere last night? I was worried- There’s blood on the couch.” The room remained cold. There was no one here. 

“Can you turn the lights off on the way out?” It was as if Brandon was standing right behind me. I yelped, stumbling forward. Whipping around, only the empty hall was behind me. The rats scratched more fervently. 

Oh God, there was no one there. 

I raced out the room, slamming into my bedroom and flinging shut the door. 

I scrambled into the corner, heart pounding through my ears and eyes. Something continued to blabber outside in Brandon’s voice. *Oh Mary, full of grace.*  I found myself praying out of sheer instinct, years of following my mother’s church shoes. *God please, is this some kind of punishment? Please, I’ve tried to be good. I didn’t mean it.* 

“Gl-d I wnt wk p” Whatever it was was suddenly outside my door in the hall. 

“Please stop! I don’t know what you want!” I managed to whine out a plea through my fervent prayer. The angels in the walls scratched harder and harder, as if trying to break out and drag me away. My eyes were watering now, and every fiber of my body stood on end as if it had its own electrical current. *Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary.* 



For a long time I stayed crouched in that corner; long after whatever was taunting me stopped speaking. By the time I moved, only my hair was still wet. The angels continued to scratch in the walls, and I felt them watch me in my closed off room for the rest of the afternoon. 

I went to work that evening in a daze. I sleepwalked into the gas station. The fluorescent lights shone as cold as the AC, which was far too cold for the brisk fall air outside. Despite the overstimulating reflective surfaces and goosebumps crawling up my arms, it was better than being at the flat. 

Alone at the counter stood my coworker, looking more than ready for the shift change over. 

“Hey. How’s it going?” She was leaning on the counter amongst the candy bars and stacks of takeaway cups. My feet carried me towards the staff room. 

“Good. How was your shift?” It was more of a mumble that came out of my mouth than anything. Still, she followed me with her eyes before following me to the back. 

“Uh fine. Quiet for a Tuesday. I mean, I wouldn’t know. I was just covering since Brandon didn’t show; I don’t normally work today.” She shrugged on an obnoxiously red raincoat. My tongue seemed stuck to the roof of my mouth. 

“I mean he’s probably just pulling a sickie like usual.” She glanced at me. “Are you okay? You look kinda pale. Please don’t say you’re sick too.” I felt sick. 

“I’m alright. Just didn’t sleep well.” It didn’t seem like she cared past that. 

“Okay then, see you. Try not to fall asleep.” And with that she walked out of the store. Mechanically, I put down my bag and wandered to the counter. 

The rest of the shift seemed to disappear before my eyes in a vortex of thoughts. Over and over the events of the day flickered through my mind with an unending list of questions. 

*Why are they watching me? Why now? I never meant for anyone to get hurt.* Over and over and over. *Why did Brandon have to suffer because of me? Are they watching me right now? I’m a bad person. I did this. I deserve this.* 

Customers occasionally shuffled in and out of the store. Not a single face comes to mind thinking back. 

*Dear God, I’m sorry. I’ll try harder. I’ll be better. Just tell me what to do to make up for it.* 

As the sun set, the fluorescent lights glow made it seem as if the day would never end. Anxiety crawled through every muscle like every test I’ve ever taken. But I didn’t know when this one would end. If it ever would. 

I managed to fight my way out of my head enough to close the store. Sitting in my car, waiting for the warmth of the heater, I was frozen. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where they were waiting; awaiting my judgement. Behind that door there was still a black stain in my faded red couch. 

A loud, obnoxious, default ringtone was blaring from my pocket. Digging it out I was met with a smiling picture of Mum. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi sweetie! I was trying to call you!”

“Oh. I was at work.”

“All day? Joking! I know you’re so busy with your study and friends!” I only have one friend, and she wasn’t even mine to begin with. My Mum thinks more highly of me and I am not inclined to burst her bubble. “I just wanted to call and see how you were holding up? I hadn’t heard from you for a while.”

“I’m fine, Mum. Just been busy.”

“How was your exam? That um… lab one.” It was Anatomy 304. 

“Ah, it went alright. Didn’t do as well as I wanted to.” Or as well as I needed to pass that class. 

“Well you tried and that’s what matters. I’m proud of you for even getting in!” I did try, and I did fail, and it’s a community college with a 90% acceptance rate. The words still stung at my eyes. Her standards have lowered since Daniel. 

“Thanks. I might have to go. I’m just in my car right now.”

“Okay. Well I’ll call you later in the week. I love you.”

“Love you too. Bye.”

“Bye, sweetie.” The silence in the car felt heavier. My Mum couldn’t know what I had done, what I had caused. My phone clicked onto silence. I turned on my headlights, hoping to anything but angels that they would lead me away.

I unlocked my front door with trembling hands. I had already heard the skittering before I pulled out my key. Coat away, bag unpacked, shoes off; I gathered my courage. I made a plan in my head.

“Hello.” It came out a whisper. I didn’t know what else to say to them. They didn’t respond other than some slight scratching. I moved shyly into the kitchen, afraid to breathe. Pulling out cereal, I poured it into several bowls. *What am I even doing.* Taking the bowls I placed them around my flat. One next to the TV cabinet, one next to the toilet, a bowl in the entry way and on top of my closet as close to the hole in the ceiling as possible, and lastly one next to the couch. 

I don’t know what I expected; maybe to feed them, appease them. My mum did always say to offer guests something to eat. I found myself lighting candles in the living room and digging out the dusty bibles my Mum gave me when I moved out. Not quite having figured out what I was doing, I just stacked them on my coffee table. When I stepped back, my home looked like a strange funeral. 

“If you need something… Just say. I’ll try to be an okay host.” My voice faded out at the end, feeling silly talking to the walls. Heat flushed my cheeks for a moment but that icy black spot only a foot away drove me back to the reality of it all. I crept back to my room, once again an intruder in my own home. 



For the first time since I left home, I prayed before bed. I had never once prayed for friends or good scores, though maybe I needed to, but right now, I prayed for forgiveness. I somehow fell asleep after praying that I would wake up a better person. 

I woke up feeling unrested. My sheets had wrapped around me in the night and my joints ached from the battle. I fought my way out of bed as the cooling sheen of sweat left me uncomfortable. 

The angels shuffled quietly through the walls as I walked through to the kitchen. The room was hazy and golden, like every other morning, but the chill still crawled over my skin. Over breakfast I tried to research what was happening to me. *Angels seen IRL. Do angels exist? How to live a virtuous life. Am I going to Hell?* Most of the videos were obviously fake, glaringly full of bad photoshop and worse acting. A few promising leads led me to fanatic christian blogs but all their claims of angels and miracles were only anecdotal at best. It seemed that this was my burden to bear. 

With my head clouded in articles and the burning loneliness of my situation I headed out into the brisk morning to try and grapple with it all. The cold air numbing my face was a perfect distraction for my muddy head. Something about the physical sensation of the cold just helped pull me back to the here and now. I don’t know where I planned to go, but I just kept walking further and further from the crowded apartment. 

I must have done it unconsciously, but I arrived at the steps of a small local church. Just a tiny building, a metal cross over the doorway and rough off white concrete with chipping paint, and sparse trees littered in thin gardens around it. A few lone cars sat in the carpark, windows foggy, but I couldn’t see anyone inside. I hesitated on the stairs. Who better to discuss this with than a priest, but it had been a long time since I had stepped foot in a church. This wasn’t a place I belonged anymore. Yet neither was my own apartment. Or my childhood home seven towns over. *Do I belong anywhere anymore? Do I deserve to belong to anyone anymore?* Before I lost my courage I pushed through the heavy door. 

The church was wide and empty, despite its small size. The only person I could see was an elderly priest standing at a side table. He was pushing through a bible with the gnarled fingers of one hand and making notes to a sermon with the other. He didn’t look up as I entered, but I felt him acknowledge me anyway. Somewhere deeper in the church I could hear someone, *or something*, moving around. It was so quiet I felt as if my breathing was disturbing the peace. I shuffled in and let the door swing shut behind me. For a moment I just stood there in the doorway, unsure what to do. A small confessional booth caught my eye. As if afraid of being caught, I softly walked over to it and slipped inside. 

The hard wood was uncomfortable but it was comforting to be hidden away from it all; a facade of protection behind the carved walls. The wood on the other side of the divider creaked as someone sat down next to me. We sat there quietly, just breathing. I brushed down my dark blue coat as if I had to appear presentable. Or maybe it was just in a way of delaying the conversation; of building my confidence. 

“Forgive me father for I have sinned.” My voice was hushed, afraid of breaking the awkward serenity of the church. “I’m sorry, I don’t remember how this is meant to go.”

“That’s quite alright. Just tell me what’s haunting you.” His voice was raspy, possibly a smoker’s, but had a strong, almost posh, undertone. 

“I think I’m being judged.” My breath shook as I forced out my confession. He hummed quietly in contemplation. 

“We are all being judged. Do you think you deserve it?”

“Yes.”

“Why is that? You are here to be forgiven are you not? To be forgiven you must first be judged.”

“I think…” I paused and let his words hang over me. “I don’t know if I can be forgiven. I think it’s in my nature.”

“We can all be forgiven, my child. Otherwise there would not be a single angel in Heaven.”

“Then why are they watching me? I prayed for forgiveness.”

“Who is watching you?” He coughed slightly next to me. It may as well have been a gunshot. 

“I don’t know. Angels, I think. Maybe God through them.”

“There is a comfort in having them watch over you, even if they may be the eyes of judgement. Just let them guide you; they will tell you if you are on the right path.” I couldn’t force out how I had already been punished. 

“Thank you, Father.” I could feel my eyes start to well. “Am- Am I forgiven?” He shuffled a little. His voice was closer to the divider when he spoke. I could see his silhouette through the carved wood.

“Of course, my child. Be at peace.” I rose unsteadily, and fled the church before a tear could fall. 

The cold wind outside made my eyes water anyway as I made my way home again. In my chest, I knew my forgiveness wouldn’t change anything, I was being judged for everything to come just as much as my past sins, but it made me feel lighter. Just a bit.

After four years in Rhode Island, we decided to move out of Farmerville, Louisiana, in 1979. However, Farmerville was just a little too country for us. It only had one gas station and one restaurant. It was in a dry county, and it was a sixty-mile round trip to Ruston or Monroe to do anything fun.

Most of the people in the Kingdom Hall had moved to Farmerville to help the struggling congregation. There were only two families who were actually from the area. So, everyone was trying to convince visitors to move there, the reason being that if you could get someone else to move there, you could move out. That way you wouldn’t *feel guilty* for abandoning our struggling congregation. We didn’t wait to find our replacements.

I was finally weaning myself off of the guilt.

We got on the phone with Debbie’s best friend Lynn Garrett, who lived in Oregon. After an hour on the phone we decided to move to Oregon, sight unseen. In fact, we didn’t even know it rained there.

When I left Bethel, I made a vow to never work for anyone else, but in Oregon, I got a job as a lumber broker at *Sun Tree Lumber Company* and then at *Western International Forest Products.* I worked my way up to division manager. Even though I made great money, I hated the corporate politics. In 1990, I started working for myself again and became a real estate agent.

My whole life seemed to zoom by in a blur. Weeks turned into months. Months turned into years. Week after week of Witness meetings. Five meetings a week. Thousands of meetings. Endless meetings. Jehovah this and Jehovah that. Hurry, Jehovah is coming, no time to waste.

How did I rationalize everything I had experienced growing up in the Jehovah’s Witnesses and what I saw at Bethel? No one wants to believe his or her whole life is a lie. For many years, I couldn’t connect the dots. I guess that’s not true. I didn’t want to connect the dots. If I had, those dots would have pointed me in only one direction: the backside of building four with my friend Jimmy Olsen.

To paraphrase Scarlett O’Hara at the end of *Gone with the Wind,* “*I can’t think about that right now. I know I’ll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day!”*

If you ever back a Jehovah’s Witness into a corner, and they have to admit to the problems and insanity that is going on around them, they will tell you one of two things: “*You must have faith” or “Jehovah will take care of all the problems someday.”*

See how easy that was? Now you don’t have to think about all those discrepancies and the things that make no sense whatsoever.

In my fifty years as a Jehovah’s Witness, there were a few occasions when it happened. When I thought to myself, I’m in a religion just like all the others. It would be on those darkest nights when my thoughts went into the forbidden zone of doubt – the zone the Society said you could never go to.

Once, many years after Bethel, I was with several of my old Bethel buddies, guys who had been Jehovah’s Witnesses and Elders for thirty, forty and even fifty years. These guys had seen all kinds of insanity associated with this religion. We sat in my hot tub and gazed up at the stars. And the words came out. The thoughts that I believe almost every Jehovah’s Witness has had at least once in his or her lifetime. You might say the words to your closest friend or you might just think them to yourselves.

The words are: *“Even if this isn’t the truth, it is still a good way of life…. isn’t it?”*

Really?

In the end, this rationalization is how most Jehovah’s Witnesses coped with all the discrepancies, flip flops and the amazing confusing *new light* that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. We rationalized the insanity by thinking that we were living *“a good way of life.”*

On the other hand, doesn’t this really mean the *end justifies the means*?

Usually most, if not all, of our family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, plus all of our friends are part of the Society. There is no world but that world, their world. I wasn’t ready to leave the only world I had ever known. If I had connected the dots back then, there would have been no place to go. I would have been on the outside looking in. To lose the only life I had ever known would have put me on the couch looking at the .38 special revolver on the coffee table. Just like my father-in-law Robert had done. I stopped thinking about it. I couldn’t think about it.

I was back in bindery-line mode. I was just trying to get through each day sticking one book into the machine at a time.

Then if you might be drifting away there is a rope that can pull you even tighter into the cement of their organization. This rope they use is one of the key reasons why a crazy old man named Charles Russell could turn just a few followers into millions of drones and create an organization worth billions of dollars.

So, what is this rope?

Sex... and it is how the vast majority Jehovah's Witnesses are created now and not from the *door to door work*. Yes millions of Jehovah's Witnesses having sex with millions of other Jehovah's Witnesses.

I didn’t know it at the time, but the *rope of bondage* to their organization for me and many others was actually an umbilical cord attached to my two children. We now had two new young ones who we were charged to indoctrinate. As children, they had no choice in the matter. My mother never asked me what I thought of her new religion, and my children did not have that option, either. They could make the decision to leave the religion that felt like *“the Borg*” from *Star Trek* years later. Of course, if they left also, it too would cost them everything.

Even if I didn’t take a lead in indoctrinating my children, my wife surely would. At the time of their births, I was still a believer, so my path was clear.

Now that I had a family, we had one more meeting each week added to the five meetings we already attended. That meeting was called the *Family Home Bible Study.* This weekly study was required to mold the children to the will of the organization – to the will of the all-powerful god Jehovah. It was easy to do.

There would be only one world for my children: the world we showed them. Just like me, they were eager to join their new family – the family of millions of *Brothers and Sisters* all around the world. They soon became the righteous and zealous followers we wanted them to be.

Our children sometimes didn’t go willingly into the Jehovah’s Witnesses thought system. Just like most Jehovah’s Witness parents, we too employed corporal punishment at times. We were told by our leaders that our future young converts needed to be kept in line. It was not unusual and you will see it often—Jehovah’s Witness parents in the Kingdom Hall grabbing up their screaming two year old and taking them outside for an attitude adjustment by way of a spanking. For some odd reason, it wasn’t easy to keep a small child sitting in their seats quietly for over two hours.

The Witnesses love to quote the famous phrase, *“spare the rod and spoil the child”* even though this phrase is not in the Bible. The actual quote was written by Samuel Butler, a 17th century poet, but it is likely inspired from the Bible verse in Proverbs 13:24, “Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them.”

This meant that my father would take me out into the parking lot and explain this wonderful Bible passage to me many times growing up as a child. I would, of course, be doing the same thing to my children years later.

The beat/beatings goes on. No pun intended.

Has Kurt Vonnegut said it so perfectly in *Slaughterhouse five* ""and so it goes.""

There is an interesting true story about a rambunctious five year old that the Witnesses love to relay and laugh about. In the middle of the Watchtower study, a young mother annoyed by her child’s behavior grabs him and throws him over her shoulder. The child obviously knows what is waiting for him in the parking lot. As they are heading down the aisle and towards the exit the child looks back over his mother’s shoulder and yells out, “*Jehovah, save me!”*

There was one time when my five-foot, sixteen-year-old daughter stood up for herself. She wanted to do something that was not in line with the church’s policies. It became a yelling match and I, who no longer could defend my position became enraged and out of control. There was no logic to my defense and she knew it. I guess on some level I knew it too. I got up from my seat and slapped her across her face. I will never forget how she looked sitting there in silence, with tears in her eyes. I had totally crushed the spirit in this young woman. I knew in that moment I had crossed over some line. I truly hated what I had become, an enforcer of the church’s unreasonable policies.

Just like it was for me, there would be no school dances, no school sports and no school friends who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses. My children, too, would be isolated for their protection and for the protection of the organization.

They both left high school so they could be homeschooled. The Witnesses love to create a vacuum in which they insulate their children. This was one way to keep the children safe and away from the contamination of any *worldly influences* and desires. The information the children received and their environment were strictly controlled. Many Jehovah’s Witness families don’t even own a television set back then. Some even refer to the TV as “the Devil’s box.”

It their teens, my children were both baptized. We had done our job; they had joined *the club* and were now locked in. They both pioneered and went to pioneer school, so, just like the vast majority of Witness children back then, there would be no college education for them.

Most religions, like governments, like to keep their people ignorant.

We even took them back to New York in 1996 to visit Bethel. My son was seventeen and my daughter was nineteen. In some sick way, I was hoping my son would want to go there too. You know, to make a man out of him like it did me. It seemed like a good idea at the time, since I was still taking my *“crazy pills.*”

I really do believe that kids today are so much smarter than their parents. After my son walked through the old factory and book bindery, he knew it wouldn’t be a place for him. He said he couldn’t find one smiling face there.

He was right of course, because twenty years later things hadn’t changed much.

In fact, it was the wisdom (the ability of spotting bull shit) from my children, just a few years later, that would be instrumental in my departure from the church also.

My daughter likes to relay the story about a lunch she and I enjoyed many years ago. This was a couple years later, after our Bethel trip. I forget what we were talking about. However in the course of the conversation, she got the nerve up to tell me there were many things about the church’s policies that made no sense to her and she frankly was having a hard time believing in anymore. She set there waiting for my response. What happened next, was a defining moment for her and for me too. I guess she was waiting for me to regurgitate the church’s propaganda and defend the insanity.

I could not do this any longer. Instead I set there with what she would describe as a funny, little, weird look on my face. She told me years later that in that moment, not by anything I said but just the look I had on my face, she knew I wasn’t buying the program anymore either. For me, I realized that my daughter was coming to the same conclusions I was having. Yes, our days of drinking the *Kool-Aid* together would soon be over.

Anyway back on our Bethel Tour. We went through the new laundry and saw Peter Hollingsworth. He had been at Bethel for twenty-seven years and had worked in the laundry the entire time. I told Bob Rains that they needed to give poor Peter a break and let the guy out of the laundry.

I found Daryl Christianson stuck in the Squibb building, working by himself on a deserted floor. I don’t know what he was doing, maybe sorting paperclips or something.

Self righteous, Daryl had only one memory about me that he wanted to relay to my children. I had known Daryl for four years and all he could think about was a time twenty-five-years earlier when my car was acting up. He told my family how I decided to turn the car around and go back to Bethel instead of going to the meeting that Sunday. Yes, because of me and my car troubles, he had missed a *Watchtower study*. It was probably the only Watchtower study he had ever missed in his thirty years at Bethel.

What a jerk.

Daryl looked and seemed like all the other old, dried-up, company men I had known years earlier.

We sat at Norm Brekke’s table for lunch and ate hamburgers. There wasn’t much conversation. Dozens of people were chowing down. The dining room was deathly quiet, just like the old days.

I sat there and wondered how many other suicides Norm had known about in his fifty years at the headquarters.

After lunch, I met with my old friend Ciro Aulicino. He had a very prestigious job in the writing department again. I say again he had been kicked out of there back in the 1970's.

He had received a job change to the hand bindery in the factory back in 1973. He went from writing the articles in the *Watchtower and Awake!* to pasting song books together in the hand bindery. Of course, they told him his new job was a *“privilege of service.”*

I’ll never forget the look on his face when I had to inform him that his “*privilege of service”* was really *“the shaft”* instead. He couldn’t believe it. He just couldn’t believe it was possible after so many years of faithful service.

However, now twenty years later, Cerio informed me, with a smile on his face, that he was back in the writing department and no longer in the hand bindery. *The shaft* had been removed. He was back on top again and the evil men who put him there were are all gone.

I didn’t know it at the time, but Ciro was the person who was chiefly responsible for turning the *Watchtower Bible and Tract Society* into an NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) member of… *the United Nations!*

If you are a not a Jehovah’s Witness reading this, you probably couldn’t care less about this. But if you are a Jehovah’s Witness, this is huge. Why? Because the Jehovah’s Witnesses had spent decades condemning the United Nations as the *scarlet-colored wild beast in the Book of Revelation*. They have always believed this organization is run by the Devil himself.

The Society became a Non-Governmental Organization Associate Member of the UN in 1992. In order to join this organization, they would have to sign and AGREE to the UN charter. This charter clearly states that, as a member, the Society must “*support and respect the principles of the charter of the United Nations.”*

Do you see a problem here? Let’s connect some dots. According to the Witnesses, the United Nations is an organization run by Satan himself and will soon be destroyed by god himself. Now they have agreed to join one of Satan’s organizations and even sign a document stating they would *respect* its charter.

Does this *Kool-Aid* taste strange?

For nine years, the Society was a member of the United Nations. In 2001, the Society resigned its membership. Why? Did they get some more *new light* on the matter? It could be, but the real reason was because of the shit storm that their membership created within the organization. Many of the smart Jehovah’s Witnesses could see the bullshit and severed all ties with the Society for what they considered to be a hypocritical and dishonest chapter of the religion’s history.

Anyway, back to my reunion tour of the *Lord’s house*. Before that day, I hadn’t been back to Bethel in twenty-two years. I left the headquarters for the second and last time in my life. I had a strange feeling that nothing had really changed there. It was like walking back in on an *Orwellian movie*.

From Brooklyn, our tour bus headed north and finally ended up at the *Watchtower Farm.* I had never been to the *Watchtower Farm*. Yes, I had been at Bethel for four years and never visited the farm, not even once. I told people it would have been like showing a starving man a steak dinner. I knew if I had seen it back then, it would have made my stay in Brooklyn that much harder. For people who were transferred to the farm from the factory, it was like leaving a concentration camp and being sent to Hawaii.

I even tracked down Ester Lopez, the old bat from Dixon’s table. She was still alive and was now at the *Watchtower Farm.* I had her paged. I stood there in the lobby, waiting for her with my family. I had looked forward to this moment the whole day.

She walked into the lobby with a total look of surprise. “It’s you! It’s you!” She said.

“Yes, it’s me.” I didn’t say anything more as I walked right over to her and grabbed her hand and put it on my stomach and held it there. I had put on a few pounds since I left Bethel. I held her hand and patted it on my stomach, “You were wrong, Ester. I didn’t starve to death like you predicted!”

She had a confused look on her face and of course she had no idea what I was talking about but I remembered what she had said to me way back in 1974.

*The Great Tribulation* that was to happen before Armageddon that she and millions of Jehovah's Witnesses had hoped for hadn’t come. This, of course, meant I didn’t have the opportunity to starve to death as Ester had hoped for.

That was twenty-eight years ago I'm still fat and the old bat is long dead....rest in peace.

I was raised catholic, same as my mother, and her mother; grew up going to church, singing in the back row of the school choir, but it never really sunk in for me. The only time I understood the fear my mother felt was leafing through her yellowing children’s bibles. The idea of those angels, with so many rolling eyes and golden bodies, being able to see me. My brother would make fun of me for it, but I hid under the covers every time I read them so those colourful paper angels wouldn’t see me look at them in fear. 

I stopped attending church when I moved away to university.

When this all began, I believed my dingy apartment was infested with rats. The place was cheap, and already had a serious mold problem.  I began to wake up in the night to scratching in the walls. I called my landlord, who called exterminators, who came in and went with no help. Nothing was ever caught in the traps I put out, and for a while I thought maybe I had some sort of overworked student psychosis until my friend Rebbekah suggested we move to the library study rooms. 

As someone who couldn’t afford another place so close to campus, I began to just try to live with it, as any other student would. It was after I came home from my home town, after the anniversary of my brother Daniel’s death, that it switched from rats to angels. I don’t know why I thought it, most likely a mixture of grief and sleep deprivation, but once the thought entered my head it never really left. In the moment it made sense. It was simply my own actions catching up to me, and they were preparing for my judgement. 

Maybe that little thought in the back of my head was why I let Brandon stay on my couch. Brandon, who had fought with his girlfriend. My tall, rat-like, coworker who always spoke too loudly and far too long. And maybe a part of me felt guilty for wishing his girlfriend would leave him already, even if I didn’t say it. Maybe it was because he reminded me of my brother. Maybe I thought it would make me a good person. Whatever it was, now Brandon was lying on my thrifted, once strawberry red, couch with my $15 dollar mink blanket. 

“Well, goodnight. Just wake me up if you like get cold or need something. The rats can be a bit noisy but- They don’t really do anything.” I stood like a stranger at a party in my own living room. 

“Alright. Glad I won’t wake up with some rat running over my toes then.” Brandon tossed the blanket over him. “Can you turn the lights off on the way out? I dunno where the switch is.” He was scrolling through his phone as he spoke. 

“Sure. Night.” Flicking the lights out, I left the room. 

Lying in bed, I listened to the rats scurrying through the wall. They seemed a bit livelier than usual. Perhaps they knew someone else was in the house. But if I really was being judged, it could wait until morning.

The sun awoke me. It gently shone through the thin curtains against my eyelids. I lay there a while, basking in the quiet, soft awakening. Part of me hoped that Brandon had made up with his girlfriend in the night so I could enjoy my peaceful morning. 

Eventually, the assignments in the back of my head drove me out of bed. Quietly I shuffled up, and down the hall to the lounge. I pressed the handle softly, toeing open the door to avoid potentially waking Brandon. 

Peeking in, the room was dimly lit. The sunlight was shining through the curtains, leaving the room in a warm haze. The couch was empty. Stepping in, I quickly glanced around. Perhaps he had gone to the bathroom, or to raid my kitchen. I picked up the mink blanket that lay in a heap next to the couch, quickly folding it into squares. Propping the blanket onto the back of the couch, I saw it. Some dark puddle was pooled on the couch cushions. It was dry, already having stained into the fabric, and a rich colour. 

“Brandon?” The name echoed dully through the room. “Brandon? Are you okay?” Not even the rats made a sound. My chest became tight as I tried to calmly search the apartment. The bathroom door was open and empty. *Maybe he really did make up with his girlfriend in the middle of the night.* The front door was still locked, as I left it. 

“Brandon?” The kitchen was clean, just the same dishes drying from last night’s dinner. My shoulders cradled my jaw as I wandered back to the lounge. He was just gone. As if he had vanished into another world. The dried blood stared back at me. My breath was coming shorter and shorter. I could see my eyes wide and glossy in the black reflection of his cellphone sitting on the floor. What could have happened? Surely, rats couldn’t have done this. That was absurd. The front door was still locked, all the windows closed, and I had slept like a baby all night, and Brandon was just gone. The glowy haze felt suffocating. I stared into that bright light streaming through the windows, as if that inky black spot would just vanish like he had if I tried hard enough. My eyes slowly drifted up with the sunlight. I could only think in colourful fading pages. 



I don’t know how long I stayed stuck there. My limbs were heavy. Black spots flickered through my vision, swimming through the golden light. Black spots, black spots. Brandon did not appear from any corner of the room as I waited. The haze lifted eventually. My body ached as I stumbled through the dark room. Quietly I changed clothes, brushed my hair, packed my bag, and left the apartment. I locked the door on that dark spot in my living room. 

I was an hour early for my lecture. The wind was cold so I waited in the hallway for the current lecture to finish. Occasionally some harried student or self important tutor would wander by, but they paid no mind to me. I stayed huddled from the cool draft against the wall, cupping my hands in front of my flushed face like some victim. Where I sat, the oil heater dug into my back but I didn’t feel the need to move. It was too much effort to move my leaden limbs anyway. 

Thankfully, the lecture room cleared soon enough. Students flooded out in streams, a wave of chatter and bodies. Managing to stand, I was shuffled against the wall further as wired young adults and scruffy book bags brushed against my arms. As they dissipated off to their flats and study rooms I finally moved through to the theatre. My class wasn't for another half hour, but the room didn’t have a draft like the hall did. The quiet was disconcerting after the morning. I kept expecting to hear the scuffle of rats that I had grown used to. If they were even rats at all. *Don’t think about it.* But the sparse silence of the theatre didn’t leave much for me to think about instead. I glanced around at the posters littering the walls. *Looking for participants! Study in anxiety amongst young adults.* A diagram of the muscle structure. *How grief effects you.* A poster for a guest lecture on head trauma. *Free lunch for all students. Meeting at First Church on Knox Street.* The desk suddenly became much more interesting. The grain flowed right. A knot near the top edge to my left. Three chips on the edge, two next to each other, one on the other side of my body. A darker patch in a blob-like st- 

“Marnie!” I jumped back. Rebbekah appeared at my side. “Ah! Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. Real focused on that table huh?” I glanced back down at the table. I could no longer find the stain. 

“Uh, sorry just” Shaky breath out. “Lost in a daydream I guess.”

“Okay.” Rebbekah flopped into the seat next to me, immediately spreading her stationary all across the table. “Man, I totally did not watch the last, like, four lectures so who even knows what this is about.” 

I couldn’t tell her if I wanted to. Rebbekah didn’t seem like she wanted to find out anyway as she immediately launched into a lengthy story about a man she had met at a party over the weekend. I stayed silent, watching her speak. 

Her curly maroon hair bounced every which way as she spoke, exaggerating every word. Her hands swung wildly, painting an abstract picture of this mystery man. The faded cord bracelet Daniel had given her bobbed on her wrist. Every time she spoke, she became completely lost in her own words. It was one of the reasons I just listened. The other was that I couldn’t stop her even if I tried. 

Even as class began, the lecturer’s words seemed to only be a breaker between her story. Soon I too found myself pulled into the world revolving around this claiming to be 6’4 man and his escapades amongst the very cramped house party. 

As she spoke and spoke, the events of this morning became more and more like a dream. He probably did leave in the night. Probably left his phone in the rush. The room was dark and it was early. 

As we walked out of the stuffy lecture theatre, It felt like nothing had ever happened. Rebbekah pealed off towards the library and the rest of the walk home was spent quietly. 

Arriving at the door is what snapped me back into the horrors of the morning. I hesitated to unlock it. Maybe if I never go in, it never really happened. My fingers began to hurt as the keys cut into the cold flesh. The keys seemed to jingle so loudly as I swung open the door. *Nothing happened. Brandon left last night. Just go inside.* I stepped in quickly and shut the door behind me. Walking briskly through the house, I went about putting away my coat, dropping my bag onto the bed, and taking off my shoes. *Shower, shower sounds good. Warm up.* I grabbed a towel from the edge of the basket and wandered through to the bathroom. My eyes skimmed past the yawning entrance to the living room. 

The shower was just what I needed for both my nerves and chilled skin. Warm steam seemed to flow right through my throat and lungs, soothing and gentle. Soaking in the heat, I began to feel the goosebumps fading and my fingers gently ached. The sound of the water pattering against the shower floor was a comforting background noise. *Wait*. Beyond the white noise of the water was a sound. Scratching. *Just rats.* Relieved, I went back to scrubbing through my hair, foamy trails slithering down my face and forcing me to close my eyes. I tried to ignore the scratching, to pretend it was just another layer of splashing water. My hair fell in a thick sheet as I rinsed it under the stream.

“C-n yu trn mmm” Whatever noise it was murmured under the water. I quickly opened the shower door. Goosebumps rose over my arms. The water splashed loudly on the plastic floor and the walls scratched and creaked, but I couldn’t hear any intruder walking through the hallway. 

“Can you turn off the lights-“ Brandon’s voice was right outside the door, sounding like the very night he vanished. I nearly smashed into the floor stumbling up out of the shower. Swinging open the door, towel clutched around my body, I was faced with an empty hall. 

“Brandon? Brandon, where have you been?”  My breath was catching amidst whatever was stirring in my chest. 

“Brandon?”

“Can you-“ His voice had moved towards the living room. Swinging open that door led to yet another empty room. The blanket still lay folded on the couch from this morning. Brandon’s phone, lit up with notifications, still lay unmoved on the floor. The only signs of life were my own wet footprints leading into the room. 

“Brandon? Did you go somewhere last night? I was worried- There’s blood on the couch.” The room remained cold. There was no one here. 

“Can you turn the lights off on the way out?” It was as if Brandon was standing right behind me. I yelped, stumbling forward. Whipping around, only the empty hall was behind me. The rats scratched more fervently. 

Oh God, there was no one there. 

I raced out the room, slamming into my bedroom and flinging shut the door. 

I scrambled into the corner, heart pounding through my ears and eyes. Something continued to blabber outside in Brandon’s voice. *Oh Mary, full of grace.*  I found myself praying out of sheer instinct, years of following my mother’s church shoes. *God please, is this some kind of punishment? Please, I’ve tried to be good. I didn’t mean it.* 

“Gl-d I wnt wk p” Whatever it was was suddenly outside my door in the hall. 

“Please stop! I don’t know what you want!” I managed to whine out a plea through my fervent prayer. The angels in the walls scratched harder and harder, as if trying to break out and drag me away. My eyes were watering now, and every fiber of my body stood on end as if it had its own electrical current. *Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary.* 



For a long time I stayed crouched in that corner; long after whatever was taunting me stopped speaking. By the time I moved, only my hair was still wet. The angels continued to scratch in the walls, and I felt them watch me in my closed off room for the rest of the afternoon. 

I went to work that evening in a daze. I sleepwalked into the gas station. The fluorescent lights shone as cold as the AC, which was far too cold for the brisk fall air outside. Despite the overstimulating reflective surfaces and goosebumps crawling up my arms, it was better than being at the flat. 

Alone at the counter stood my coworker, looking more than ready for the shift change over. 

“Hey. How’s it going?” She was leaning on the counter amongst the candy bars and stacks of takeaway cups. My feet carried me towards the staff room. 

“Good. How was your shift?” It was more of a mumble that came out of my mouth than anything. Still, she followed me with her eyes before following me to the back. 

“Uh fine. Quiet for a Tuesday. I mean, I wouldn’t know. I was just covering since Brandon didn’t show; I don’t normally work today.” She shrugged on an obnoxiously red raincoat. My tongue seemed stuck to the roof of my mouth. 

“I mean he’s probably just pulling a sickie like usual.” She glanced at me. “Are you okay? You look kinda pale. Please don’t say you’re sick too.” I felt sick. 

“I’m alright. Just didn’t sleep well.” It didn’t seem like she cared past that. 

“Okay then, see you. Try not to fall asleep.” And with that she walked out of the store. Mechanically, I put down my bag and wandered to the counter. 

The rest of the shift seemed to disappear before my eyes in a vortex of thoughts. Over and over the events of the day flickered through my mind with an unending list of questions. 

*Why are they watching me? Why now? I never meant for anyone to get hurt.* Over and over and over. *Why did Brandon have to suffer because of me? Are they watching me right now? I’m a bad person. I did this. I deserve this.* 

Customers occasionally shuffled in and out of the store. Not a single face comes to mind thinking back. 

*Dear God, I’m sorry. I’ll try harder. I’ll be better. Just tell me what to do to make up for it.* 

As the sun set, the fluorescent lights glow made it seem as if the day would never end. Anxiety crawled through every muscle like every test I’ve ever taken. But I didn’t know when this one would end. If it ever would. 

I managed to fight my way out of my head enough to close the store. Sitting in my car, waiting for the warmth of the heater, I was frozen. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where they were waiting; awaiting my judgement. Behind that door there was still a black stain in my faded red couch. 

A loud, obnoxious, default ringtone was blaring from my pocket. Digging it out I was met with a smiling picture of Mum. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi sweetie! I was trying to call you!”

“Oh. I was at work.”

“All day? Joking! I know you’re so busy with your study and friends!” I only have one friend, and she wasn’t even mine to begin with. My Mum thinks more highly of me and I am not inclined to burst her bubble. “I just wanted to call and see how you were holding up? I hadn’t heard from you for a while.”

“I’m fine, Mum. Just been busy.”

“How was your exam? That um… lab one.” It was Anatomy 304. 

“Ah, it went alright. Didn’t do as well as I wanted to.” Or as well as I needed to pass that class. 

“Well you tried and that’s what matters. I’m proud of you for even getting in!” I did try, and I did fail, and it’s a community college with a 90% acceptance rate. The words still stung at my eyes. Her standards have lowered since Daniel. 

“Thanks. I might have to go. I’m just in my car right now.”

“Okay. Well I’ll call you later in the week. I love you.”

“Love you too. Bye.”

“Bye, sweetie.” The silence in the car felt heavier. My Mum couldn’t know what I had done, what I had caused. My phone clicked onto silence. I turned on my headlights, hoping to anything but angels that they would lead me away.

I unlocked my front door with trembling hands. I had already heard the skittering before I pulled out my key. Coat away, bag unpacked, shoes off; I gathered my courage. I made a plan in my head.

“Hello.” It came out a whisper. I didn’t know what else to say to them. They didn’t respond other than some slight scratching. I moved shyly into the kitchen, afraid to breathe. Pulling out cereal, I poured it into several bowls. *What am I even doing.* Taking the bowls I placed them around my flat. One next to the TV cabinet, one next to the toilet, a bowl in the entry way and on top of my closet as close to the hole in the ceiling as possible, and lastly one next to the couch. 

I don’t know what I expected; maybe to feed them, appease them. My mum did always say to offer guests something to eat. I found myself lighting candles in the living room and digging out the dusty bibles my Mum gave me when I moved out. Not quite having figured out what I was doing, I just stacked them on my coffee table. When I stepped back, my home looked like a strange funeral. 

“If you need something… Just say. I’ll try to be an okay host.” My voice faded out at the end, feeling silly talking to the walls. Heat flushed my cheeks for a moment but that icy black spot only a foot away drove me back to the reality of it all. I crept back to my room, once again an intruder in my own home. 



For the first time since I left home, I prayed before bed. I had never once prayed for friends or good scores, though maybe I needed to, but right now, I prayed for forgiveness. I somehow fell asleep after praying that I would wake up a better person. 

I woke up feeling unrested. My sheets had wrapped around me in the night and my joints ached from the battle. I fought my way out of bed as the cooling sheen of sweat left me uncomfortable. 

The angels shuffled quietly through the walls as I walked through to the kitchen. The room was hazy and golden, like every other morning, but the chill still crawled over my skin. Over breakfast I tried to research what was happening to me. *Angels seen IRL. Do angels exist? How to live a virtuous life. Am I going to Hell?* Most of the videos were obviously fake, glaringly full of bad photoshop and worse acting. A few promising leads led me to fanatic christian blogs but all their claims of angels and miracles were only anecdotal at best. It seemed that this was my burden to bear. 

With my head clouded in articles and the burning loneliness of my situation I headed out into the brisk morning to try and grapple with it all. The cold air numbing my face was a perfect distraction for my muddy head. Something about the physical sensation of the cold just helped pull me back to the here and now. I don’t know where I planned to go, but I just kept walking further and further from the crowded apartment. 

I must have done it unconsciously, but I arrived at the steps of a small local church. Just a tiny building, a metal cross over the doorway and rough off white concrete with chipping paint, and sparse trees littered in thin gardens around it. A few lone cars sat in the carpark, windows foggy, but I couldn’t see anyone inside. I hesitated on the stairs. Who better to discuss this with than a priest, but it had been a long time since I had stepped foot in a church. This wasn’t a place I belonged anymore. Yet neither was my own apartment. Or my childhood home seven towns over. *Do I belong anywhere anymore? Do I deserve to belong to anyone anymore?* Before I lost my courage I pushed through the heavy door. 

The church was wide and empty, despite its small size. The only person I could see was an elderly priest standing at a side table. He was pushing through a bible with the gnarled fingers of one hand and making notes to a sermon with the other. He didn’t look up as I entered, but I felt him acknowledge me anyway. Somewhere deeper in the church I could hear someone, *or something*, moving around. It was so quiet I felt as if my breathing was disturbing the peace. I shuffled in and let the door swing shut behind me. For a moment I just stood there in the doorway, unsure what to do. A small confessional booth caught my eye. As if afraid of being caught, I softly walked over to it and slipped inside. 

The hard wood was uncomfortable but it was comforting to be hidden away from it all; a facade of protection behind the carved walls. The wood on the other side of the divider creaked as someone sat down next to me. We sat there quietly, just breathing. I brushed down my dark blue coat as if I had to appear presentable. Or maybe it was just in a way of delaying the conversation; of building my confidence. 

“Forgive me father for I have sinned.” My voice was hushed, afraid of breaking the awkward serenity of the church. “I’m sorry, I don’t remember how this is meant to go.”

“That’s quite alright. Just tell me what’s haunting you.” His voice was raspy, possibly a smoker’s, but had a strong, almost posh, undertone. 

“I think I’m being judged.” My breath shook as I forced out my confession. He hummed quietly in contemplation. 

“We are all being judged. Do you think you deserve it?”

“Yes.”

“Why is that? You are here to be forgiven are you not? To be forgiven you must first be judged.”

“I think…” I paused and let his words hang over me. “I don’t know if I can be forgiven. I think it’s in my nature.”

“We can all be forgiven, my child. Otherwise there would not be a single angel in Heaven.”

“Then why are they watching me? I prayed for forgiveness.”

“Who is watching you?” He coughed slightly next to me. It may as well have been a gunshot. 

“I don’t know. Angels, I think. Maybe God through them.”

“There is a comfort in having them watch over you, even if they may be the eyes of judgement. Just let them guide you; they will tell you if you are on the right path.” I couldn’t force out how I had already been punished. 

“Thank you, Father.” I could feel my eyes start to well. “Am- Am I forgiven?” He shuffled a little. His voice was closer to the divider when he spoke. I could see his silhouette through the carved wood.

“Of course, my child. Be at peace.” I rose unsteadily, and fled the church before a tear could fall. 

The cold wind outside made my eyes water anyway as I made my way home again. In my chest, I knew my forgiveness wouldn’t change anything, I was being judged for everything to come just as much as my past sins, but it made me feel lighter. Just a bit.

\[Jasmine’s POV\]

""Harlow!"" My manager’s voice cracked through the hallway like a gunshot, silencing every conversation within earshot. Heads turned. No one wanted to miss the show.

He stormed toward me, his eyes blazing, and jabbed his phone inches from my face. On the screen: the email I’d sent barely twenty minutes ago.

“Is this a joke? Please tell me this is a joke.”

My throat tightened as I scanned the message. There it was, the mistake. I’d written 10:30 AM instead of 10:00. A thirty-minute error. Fuck.

“It’s just a small–” I began.

“A small what?” he snapped, cutting me off. “A small fuck-up with a C-level exec involved? Do you have any idea what you just did to the schedule? Jesus, Jasmine, are you even capable of doing this job without tripping over your own incompetence?”

The words hit like a physical blow. Fury coiled tight in my chest, but I forced myself to remain calm.

This wasn't about a typo, this was about reminding me of my place.

""I understand your concern,"" I replied, voice professionally neutral despite the storm inside me. ""I take full responsibility and will ensure it doesn't happen again.""

He pulled out a thick stack of contracts, shoving them into my hands. ""Take these to Conference Room A. The Blackwoods are waiting!""

I gave a stiff nod and walked away, cheeks burning.

It wasn't the first time someone had tried to put me in my place at Cadence Records. The thing is, I'm good at what I do. Exceptional, even.

I navigate this chaos like I was born for it, juggling schedules, managing producers, keeping everything organized. I have a sharp ear for music and contribute to more projects than anyone realizes, but I'm invisible in the ways that matter.

Just the girl who keeps the machine running.

The moment I stepped into Conference Room A, the atmosphere shifted. Three men sat around that stupidly expensive table, and I immediately understood why my manager had been sweating bullets when he handed me these contracts.

Liam Blackwood commanded the head of the table like he owned the building, which he actually did. Sleeves rolled up over forearms that belonged in a fucking gym advertisement, perpetual five-o'clock shadow that suggested he'd rather be anywhere but in a boardroom.

When he glanced up, his green eyes held the kind of stare that made you wonder if he could see straight through your bullshit corporate smile to every dirty thought you'd never admit out loud.

""Good afternoon,"" I managed, sounding way more professional than I felt. ""I have the contracts you requested.""

""Thank you,"" Liam replied, his voice deep and smooth. ""Just set them down here.""

Moving around the table felt like walking through quicksand. Every step is hyperaware, every breath calculated.

I placed the copies in front of each man, and when Liam's fingers brushed mine—my brain short-circuited: *Holy shit, he's gorgeous.*

Asher Blackwood sat to his right, and where Liam was a barely contained chaos, his younger brother was a polished control.

Head of A\&amp;R, power radiated from his perfectly tailored suit, dark hair dark hair tousled in that *‘I woke up like this but actually spent twenty minutes with pomade’* way, and a jawline so sharp it could slice through my carefully constructed professional composure.

His mouth lived in a permanent state of almost-scowling, like he was constantly annoyed by everyone's existence.

""Anything else we need to know?"" His voice was rougher than Liam's, gravel and smoke with an edge that sent shivers cascading down my spine like dominoes.

""Standard terms are highlighted on page three,"" I replied, fighting to ignore how his stare made me feel completely fucking exposed.

Like he could see every fantasy I'd never voice.

Then there was Finn Blackwood, sprawled back in his chair with the kind of casual confidence that suggested he'd never encountered a situation he couldn't charm, manipulate, or fuck his way through.

Their cousin, but he fit into their power dynamic like he'd been molded for it.

Tousled hair that begged for fingers, shirt unbuttoned just enough to be borderline inappropriate, and that trademark smile—the kind that could talk nuns into strip clubs.

No instruction to leave, so I stood there like an idiot, trapped in professional purgatory while they reviewed documents. But my eyes had developed a mind of their own, cataloging every detail despite every rational neuron screaming to look anywhere else.

These weren't just my bosses—they were legends walking around in human suits. Powerful, successful, completely out of my twenty-five-years-old-virgin league in every conceivable way.

Yet that didn't stop my brain from diving headfirst into dangerous, completely inappropriate territory.

What would it feel like to run my fingers through Asher's hair? Mess up that controlled perfection? Would he lose that calculated composure if I pushed the right buttons?

That man Liam—fuck, would that raw intensity translate into other areas? Those hands on my skin, that barely contained energy focused entirely on making me fall apart?

And Finn... Jesus Christ. With that lazy smile and those knowing eyes, I could practically hear him whispering things that would make my toes curl.

I was so lost in mental gymnastics that bordered on pornographic that I didn't realize how long I'd been staring, basically eye-fucking all three of them simultaneously, until Finn glanced up.

He caught my gaze with laser precision, and that knowing glint in his eyes suggested he could read every single filthy thought racing through my head.

""See something you like?"" he asked, voice dropping to a register that bypassed my brain entirely and went straight to my nervous system.

That trademark grin spread across his face like spilled sin while mortification crashed over me like a cold wave. My face flamed red, and I quickly looked away, mumbling something incoherent about needing to get back to work.

""I should... the other contracts..."" I stammered, backing toward the door like a deer caught in headlights.

I fled the room as fast as my heels would carry me, my heart pounding so hard I was sure they could hear it. Damn it, I was supposed to be professional, not fantasizing about my bosses like some schoolgirl with a crush.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, jolting me back to reality. The caller ID showed my baby-brother’s name.

""Leo?"" I answered, stepping into an empty office for privacy.

""Jas..."" His voice was shaking, barely above a whisper. ""I messed up. I messed up really bad.""

The air seemed to leave my lungs all at once. ""What do you mean? What happened?""

""I thought I could fix it myself, but they wanted the money immediately. They're not waiting anymore.""

""Leo, slow down,"" I said, gripping the edge of a filing cabinet for support. ""What money? Who wants money?""

""I borrowed it,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""I thought... I thought I could help… But now these people—""

""How much?"" I whispered, dreading the answer.

""Thirty-seven thousand dollars.""

The number hit me like a physical blow and I slumped against the wall, my knees suddenly weak. ""Leo, listen to me—""

""Harlow!"" A sharp voice cut through the office, making me jump.

One of the senior assistants was standing in the doorway, hands on her hips and an impatient expression on her face.

""I need those media contact sheets for the Morrison project. Where the fuck are they?""

Looking from the phone to the woman, I felt panic rising in my throat.

I closed my eyes, torn between my professional responsibilities and my brother's terrified voice on the other end of the line. In the end, survival instinct won.

I need this job more than ever now.

""Leo,"" I whispered urgently into the phone, ""I have to go. We'll talk about this at home tonight, okay?""

""But Jas—""

""Tonight,"" I said firmly, then hung up before I could change my mind. I slipped the phone back into my pocket and looked up at the assistant with a forced smile. ""The Morrison materials are on my desk. I'll get them for you right now.""

As I walked back to my workstation, my legs felt unsteady.

Everything around me looked the same, the familiar chaos of the office, the stacks of paperwork, the framed photos of Grammy winners on the walls, but it all felt suddenly fragile, like it could disappear at any moment.

My hands were shaking as I reached for the contracts, and for the first time in my life, I understood what true desperation felt like.

*Where the hell am I going to find thirty-fucking-seven damned thousand dollars?*

Chapter 2

Walking into our apartment felt like stepping into a crime scene where the victim was my peace of mind and the murder weapon was whatever fresh hell Leo had unleashed this time.

Leo was planted on our piece-of-shit couch like he'd grown roots, staring at some mindless sitcom with the volume muted.

His hands were doing this weird compulsive thing—rubbing together, then wiping on his jeans, then back to rubbing like he was trying to scrub off invisible guilt. Classic Leo stress response.

I'd seen it enough times to know we were about to have a conversation that would age me approximately six years.

He didn't even look up when I walked in. Red flag number two.

""Leo."" I used my no-bullshit voice, the one that usually got results.

When he finally looked up, I wanted to travel back in time and hug eleven-year-old me for thinking we'd escaped the worst of our childhood drama.

His eyes were red-rimmed, his usually decent hair looking like he'd been stress-grooming for hours. He looked younger than his twenty-one years, more like the scared kid I remembered from our worst foster placement.

""You want to tell me what's really going on?"" I stayed standing, arms crossed. ""Because thirty-seven thousand dollars doesn't just materialize from thin air, and you've been acting like someone's holding a gun to your head.""

Leo's Adam's apple did this nervous bobbing thing. ""I borrowed it for Mom and Dad.""

I froze, the water glass halfway to my lips and nearly slipped from my hands. ""I'm sorry, what now?""

""They needed help, Jas. Medical bills. Mom's been sick and—""

""Stop."" The word came out sharp enough to cut glass. I set my water down harder than necessary. ""Just fucking stop right there. Are you seriously telling me you borrowed thirty-seven thousand dollars *for those people*?""

""They're our parents—""

""No."" I was pacing now, because sitting still would've meant accepting this insanity. ""No, they're not. Parents don't abandon their kids. Parents don't choose heroin over making sure their children don't starve. Parents don't—""

""They said they were clean!"" Leo's voice cracked like he was twelve again. ""They said they needed help getting back on their feet, that Mom had medical issues and they just needed—""

""How long?"" I spun around to face him. ""How long have you been talking to them behind my back?""

His silence was loud enough to wake the dead.

""Leo. How fucking long?""

""A year and a half,"" he whispered.

I swear I felt something break inside my chest. ""A year and a half? You've been in contact with those people for over a year and you never told me?""

“See! ‘Cause I knew you'd lose your shit!""

""Lose my shit? You mean react like someone with a fucking functioning memory? Like someone who remembers what they put us through?""

""They said they changed!"" Leo was on his feet now, matching my energy. ""They said they were sober, that they wanted to make things right—""

""And you actually believed them?"" I was shouting now, all pretense of calm shattered. ""After everything? After they left us alone for days? After the evictions and the fights and the nights we went to bed hungry because they spent grocery money on their next fix?""

""Jasmine—""

""No, you listen!"" Tears burned my eyes, but I pushed through. ""Do you even remember being five years old and I was the only one taking care of you when you had the flu because they were too high to notice? Do you remember when CPS found us? We were eleven and seven, Leo. Eleven and seven!""

Leo's face was crumpling, but I couldn't stop.

""Do you remember the foster homes? The Hendersons who locked us in the basement when we 'misbehaved'? The Garcias who made us compete for meals? Mrs. Chen, who seemed nice until her boyfriend decided he liked teenage girls much more?""

""Stop,"" Leo whispered, sinking back onto the couch.

""Why?"" My voice was breaking now. ""You want to remember the good times? What fucking good times, Leo? When exactly were they good parents? When they missed every birthday? Every school event? Every single moment that actually mattered?""

""They're still our parents!"" Leo shouted through his tears. ""I can't just erase them like you did! I can't just pretend they don't exist!""

I stared at him like he'd grown a second head

""I thought maybe they really changed,"" he said, his voice completely broken now. ""I thought maybe... just maybe, we could have a real family. That they could actually be the parents we deserved.""

And there it was. The truth that gutted me more than any amount of debt ever could.

Looking at my little brother, my baby brother who I'd raised and protected and loved more than my own life, I saw it written all over his face.

He'd been hoping. All this time, he'd been hoping for something I'd buried years ago.

""Oh, Leo."" I sat down beside him, my anger dissolving into something deeper and infinitely more painful. ""Baby, they don't change. People like them... they just don't.""

""I know that now,"" he whispered. ""God, Jas, I know that now. The money I sent wasn't for medical bills, was it? It was for drugs. It was always for fucking drugs...""

I pulled him into my arms as he broke down completely, his shoulders shaking with sobs that seemed to come from somewhere deep and wounded inside him.

""I fucked up,"" he cried against my shoulder. ""I fucked up so bad, and now these people want their money and I don't have it and I don't know what to do.""

""How much did you send them?"" I asked quietly.

""Over the year and a half? Maybe fifteen thousand. They always had emergencies, always needed just a little more to get back on their feet."" His laugh was bitter and broken. ""But the thirty-seven thousand was different. They said Mom needed surgery, that it was life or death, and I panicked. I went to these loan sharks downtown because the banks wouldn't give me anything.""

I closed my eyes, trying to process the magnitude of this disaster. ""What exactly did these loan sharks tell you?""

""Interest compounds daily. They want forty-five thousand now, and if I don't have it by the end of next week..."" He shuddered. ""They made it clear what happens to people who don't pay.""

""We'll figure this out,"" I said, the words coming out automatically. ""I don't know how yet, but we will. Whatever it takes.""

""What does 'whatever it takes' mean?""

I looked at my brother, my responsibility since I was eleven, the only family I had left that actually mattered, and felt something fundamental shift inside me.

""I don't know yet,"" I admitted. ""But I'll figure something out. I promise you, Leo. We're not going to let them hurt you.""

He leaned against me, and we sat in silence for a long moment, both of us emotionally drained.

""I'm sorry,"" Leo whispered. ""I'm so sorry, Jas. I know you've already sacrificed everything for me, and now I've made it worse.""

""Hey."" I tilted his chin up. ""We're family, okay? Real family. The kind that shows up and doesn't bail when shit gets hard. You made a mistake, but we'll fix it together.""

Leo nodded, wiping his eyes.

I stared out at the city lights, each one representing lives that weren't falling apart, people who weren't facing impossible choices.

Forty-five thousand dollars. In fourteen days.

I wonder how much you can sell a kidney for these days.

Chapter 3

Three days had passed since Leo's breakdown, and I could feel the weight of it crushing us both.

I sat at my desk staring at the numbers I'd scribbled on a napkin.

My savings: $5,000. Leo's contribution from tips and his small emergency fund: $2,000. Total: $7,000.

We were still thirty-eight thousand dollars short.

Lunchtime at work used to mean scrolling through Instagram and pretending my desk salad was actually satisfying.

Today, it meant diving headfirst into the seventh circle of internet hell, hunting for ways to make forty-five grand appear out of thin air.

I'd already burned through the obvious shit—side jobs that would take three years to pay off Leo's debt, gig economy apps that required cars I didn't own, and freelance opportunities that demanded skills I'd never developed because I'd been too busy raising my brother to learn how to code or become a social media influencer.

Selling everything I owned might get me another few thousand, but it wouldn't even make a dent.

""Come on,"" I muttered, scrolling through job boards. ""There has to be something.""

Every search led to the same dead ends: scams promising easy money, pyramid schemes disguised as ""business opportunities,"" and offers that were either too good to be true or required me to sell my soul to some multi-level marketing cult.

Conclusion: there was no legitimate way to make that kind of money in a week.

My browser history was becoming a monument to desperation. *Quick cash jobs.* *Emergency loans no credit check.* *Ways to make money fast without skills.*

Each search is more pathetic than the last. That's when I stumbled across something that made my stomach drop straight through the office floor.

A forum thread titled *""Selling virginity for millions: real or myth?""*

My cursor hovered over the link for a full thirty seconds. Part of me wanted to close the laptop and pretend I'd never seen it. The rational part of my brain was screaming to scroll past, find a normal solution, be a normal person with normal problems.

But forty-five thousand dollars wasn't a normal problem.

I clicked.

The thread was surprisingly detailed, with links to news articles about women who'd made headlines for auctioning their virginity. A model who'd supposedly received over a million dollars, a college student who'd paid off her entire education.

The amounts were staggering. One comment caught my attention: *""It's not just a myth. There are legitimate sites for this. High-end, discrete, safe. Virtue Exchange is the most reputable.""*

My hands shook as I typed the name into a new browser window. The website that loaded was nothing like what I'd expected. Sleek, professional, and disturbingly legitimate.

Like someone had taken the concept of human trafficking and given it a Silicon Valley makeover. Women auctioning their virginity for jaw-dropping sums, all under the guise of ""empowerment"" and ""luxury experiences.""

My hands were shaking as I scrolled through profiles of women who looked nothing like me—polished, confident, the kind of people who probably had trust funds and backup plans. But the numbers... fuck, the numbers were real.

Starting bids in the tens of thousands. Completed auctions reaching six figures.

""This is insane,"" I whispered to myself, but I kept scrolling.

It was terrifying. Degrading. Absolutely fucking insane and dangerously tempting.

Because here's the thing nobody tells you about desperation: it makes the impossible seem reasonable. It takes your moral boundaries and relocates them to more convenient zip codes.

All my life, I'd been too busy playing mom to Leo to have relationships. Too focused on survival to waste time on boyfriends or one-night stands. I'd always thought my virginity and inexperience was just another thing that made me different, another way I'd missed out on normal teenage experiences.

Turns out, some rich assholes were willing to pay a premium for that exact thing.

The irony was so twisted it almost made me laugh. My ""purity"", which was really just years of having zero time for romance, apparently had market value. Who knew?

As I read through the site, calculating figures in my head, a knot formed in my stomach.

Nothing I'd found so far offered this kind of solution. Nothing else could solve Leo's problem this quickly, this completely.

And that fact alone made it impossible to look away.

I was so deep in the rabbit hole, so lost in conflicted thoughts about whether I could actually go through with something like this, that I didn't sense someone behind me until I felt it—a soft breath on my neck, a warm, low voice brushing my ear.

""Having fun at the workplace, Harlow?""

I nearly launched myself into orbit, slamming the laptop shut so hard I probably cracked the screen, spinning around to find Finn Blackwood standing right behind me.

*Way too close.*

That trademark smirk playing across his lips and a dangerously amused gleam in his eyes. My heart was doing some kind of arrhythmic death dance.

Had he seen what was on my screen? How long had he been standing there?

""Jesus Christ,"" I gasped, pressing a hand to my chest. ""Do you have some kind of ninja training, or do you just enjoy giving people heart attacks?""

The words were out before my brain caught up with my mouth. Shit. I just swore at my boss. My extremely powerful, could-fire-me-with-a-snap-of-his-fingers boss.

""I mean— Sorry, Mr. Blackwood. You startled me. That was unprofessional from my side.""

""Relax,"" Finn said with amusement in his eyes. ""I just came to ask if you had those numbers for the Drake account.""

Right. Work. Normal, professional work things that didn't involve researching how to auction off my virginity to pay my brother's debt to loan sharks.

""The Drake numbers,"" I repeated, trying to get my brain to function. ""Right. Yes. I have those.""

But Finn wasn't moving. If anything, he seemed to be enjoying my flustered state way too much.

""You seem... distracted today,"" he said, his voice taking on that playful tone that made my pulse stutter. ""Everything okay?""

""Fine,"" I said too quickly. ""Everything's totally fine. Just, you know, working. Doing work things. Very professional work things.""

His smirk widened. ""Uh-huh.""

I turned back to my computer, pulling up the Drake files with hands that were definitely not shaking. Definitely not.

I could feel him behind me, still standing too close, his presence like a live wire against my back.

""Here,"" I said, printing out the reports and handing them over without looking at him. ""Everything you need should be in there.""

Finn accepted the papers with a lazy smile, but his eyes lingered on my face. ""You know, Harlow, if I didn't know better, I'd say you've been a bad girl, getting distracted at work.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. Heat shot straight down my spine, and my thoughts spiraled into parts of my body *they absolutely shouldn't go*.

Especially not here. Especially not with my astronomically hot boss.

My cheeks flushed crimson, but I forced my voice to stay steady. ""Just focused on getting you what you need.""

""Mm-hmm."" His gaze swept over me once more, that sly smirk lingering as he stepped back. ""Thanks for these. Try not to work too hard.""

And then he was gone, leaving me alone with my racing pulse and the lingering scent of his cologne.

For a breathless second—okay, maybe more than a second—I considered it. Considered doing something reckless, something career-ending, just to see what it would feel like to have that man against me, on the desk, near the wall. On me, *in* me.

But the moment passed. Reality crashed back like ice water.

This was Finn Blackwood. Heir to a music empire, probably had a different supermodel in his bed every night, definitely out of my league in every conceivable way.

What would someone like him want with someone like me anyway? Totally inexperienced, totally ordinary, totally drowning in problems he couldn't even imagine.

And besides, I had actual problems to solve. Dangerous ones. The kind that involved broken legs and concrete shoes if I didn't figure out a solution fast.

Leo's crisis was still looming and the loan sharks' deadline was still ticking down. Lusting after my boss was a luxury I couldn't afford.

I reopened my laptop, staring at the Virtue Exchange website still glowing on my screen.

Forty-five thousand dollars. Eleven days.

*Sometimes the impossible was the only option left.*

Chapter 4

Meeting Nora for lunch is usually the highlight of my week—my best friend's chaotic energy and zero-filter commentary serving as the perfect antidote to whatever corporate bullshit I've been drowning in.

We were sitting in our usual spot at the little café across from Cadence Records, taking advantage of our lunch break to catch up.

Today, though, I'm carrying Leo's debt like a lead weight in my chest, and even Nora's trademark snark isn't quite hitting the same.

She's already two mimosas deep, her dark hair perfectly tousled in that effortless way that takes her forty-five minutes to achieve. Legal department pays better than the administrative, apparently.

""You look like death,"" she announces, not bothering with pleasantries. ""What fresh hell has life delivered to your doorstep this time?""

""Good to see you too,"" I mutter, flagging down the server. ""And I'm fine.""

""Girl, you've literally got that haunted Victorian orphan thing going on."" She leans forward, studying my face with the intensity of someone who's made a career out of reading people. ""Spill.""

I order a drink, something strong enough to numb the edges of my panic, and deflect.

""Tell me about your weekend first. I need to live vicariously through someone who actually has a sex life.""

Nora's eyes light up like Christmas morning. ""Oh, honey. Buckle up.""

What follows is a graphic, enthusiastic play-by-play of her latest conquest—some investment banker she met at a rooftop bar who apparently had both stamina and creativity.

She describes positions I'm not sure are anatomically possible and techniques that would make a porn star blush.

""And then he did this thing with his tongue that literally made me see God,"" she finishes, taking another sip of her mimosa. ""I'm talking about a full-body religious experience. I might convert to whatever religion he practices.""

I can't help but laugh despite the weight crushing my chest. ""You're insane.""

I envied her confidence. Nora moved through the world like she owned it, taking what she wanted and leaving the rest behind.

She'd been trying to set me up with someone for years, but I always found excuses.

""Speaking of men,"" she said, leaning forward with that mischievous glint in her eye, ""how are things with the holy trinity of hotness and masculine perfection upstairs?""

My drink pauses halfway to my lips. ""The what now?""

""Don't play dumb. The Blackwood brothers. Please tell me you've at least noticed that you work for three of the most fuckable men in the music industry.""

Heat crept up my neck. ""Nora, they're my bosses.""

""So? That makes it hotter, not illegal."" She leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Liam's got that whole golden retriever energy, right? All sweet eyes and gentle smiles until you realize he's probably the type who'd absolutely wreck you in bed and then bring you breakfast after.""

""Jesus Christ, Nora!""

""What? I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on Asher. That man got that whole controlled dominance thing going on. Like he'd fuck you on his desk and still expect you to take notes afterward.""

I tried to focus on my food, but images flashed through my mind. My face is on fire now. ""Can we not—""

""And Finn,"" Nora continued, completely ignoring my discomfort, ""is basically a walking sex. All that lazy confidence and that smile which could talk a nun out of her vows. I bet he's the type who'd make you laugh right before he made you come.""

""Oh my God, stop."" I buried my face in my hands, but I could feel myself blushing furiously.

""You're thinking about it now, aren't you?"" Nora's voice was pure delight. ""Finally! I was beginning to think you were made of stone.""

""I am not thinking about anything,"" I lied.

""Bullshit. You're thinking about what it would be like to have one of them pin you against a wall and—""

""Nora, please stop."" But even as I protested, my mind was already there.

I especially think about yesterday, about Finn's voice in my ear, about the way my body responded to something as simple as proximity. About fantasies I can't seem to turn off.

""Why? You're practically squirming in your seat right now."" Nora's grin is wicked. ""When's the last time you felt this turned on just from talking about someone?""

Never. The honest answer is never, but I'm not giving her that ammunition.

""They're completely out of my league,"" I say instead. ""I'm just a regular assistant in their label. They probably don't even see me as female.""

""Cut the shit."" Nora's voice turns serious. ""Jas, you're gorgeous and you have no fucking clue. You walk around in those conservative little outfits, thinking you're invisible, but trust me—they notice. I've seen how they look at you.""

""How would you even know?""

""Because I have functioning eyeballs and I pay attention. Last company mixer? Finn couldn't stop staring at you. And don't get me started on the way Liam watches you during meetings like you're the most interesting thing in the room.""

My stomach does this weird fluttery thing that I absolutely hate. ""You're imagining things.""

""I'm observant. There's a difference."" She points her fork at me accusingly. ""Your problem is you're so busy taking care of everyone else that you've forgotten you're allowed to want things.""

The words hit like a slap. ""It's not that simple.""

""It could be. You're already working with them every day. You're smart, beautiful, and you're the only woman in that office who doesn't throw herself at them like they're some kind of k-pop boysband.""

""Because I have professionalism.""

""Because you're scared."" Her voice gentles slightly. ""Look, I'm not saying you have to sleep with all three of them—though honestly, that would be the power move of the century. I'm just saying maybe it's time you stopped acting like wanting someone is a crime.""

""Even if you were right, which you're not, I wouldn't know what to do. I don't have your... extensive field experience.""

""Experience is overrated. Enthusiasm counts for way more."" That wicked grin returns. ""Besides, with men like that? They'd probably enjoy being your teacher.""

""I can't just walk up to one of them and say, 'Hey, want to take my virginity?'"" I protested.

""Why not? I bet they'd fight over the privilege.""

""You're insane.""

""I'm practical. Look, I've seen the way they look at you. All three of them. It's not a professional interest, honey. It's hunger.""

""That's not... they don't..."" But even as I tried to deny it, I remembered moments.

Lingering glances, casual touches that lasted a beat longer than necessary, the way conversations seemed to carry undercurrents I didn't understand.

The conversation shifts after that, but her words stick with me like thorns under my skin. As we part ways, she grabs my arm.

""Seriously, Jas. Life's too short to spend it wondering 'what if.' And virginity isn't some precious gift you have to save for marriage. It's just another experience to have.""

Nora's words stayed with me long after I'd returned to work and home after that.

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, my mind racing.

I pulled out my laptop, telling myself I'd look for legitimate opportunities one more time. But every job board led to the same dead ends.

That's when I found myself typing those words again: *virginity auction.*

The Virtue Exchange website loaded just as pristine and professional as before. The whole thing looked more like a luxury concierge service than anything sordid.

""What the hell am I even doing?""

Shame coiled in my stomach, but so did something else. Hope? Desperation? I couldn't tell anymore.

I closed the laptop without making any decisions, but I didn't clear my browser history either.

The next morning, I was in the kitchen making coffee when Leo stumbled through the door, still wearing his work clothes from the club. His face was pale, his hands shaking as he pulled a crumpled envelope from his jacket pocket.

\[POV Sophie\]

“*Ahh…*” The sound slips out of my mouth before I can stop it. A moan. Soft. Timed. Measured. Almost like a reflex.

Not because I feel anything. Not because I want to. But because I’m supposed to.

Ethan’s weight presses down on me, his chest damp against mine, thrusts mechanical like a body on autopilot. He always starts slow, like he thinks it’ll build to something—it never does.

The room is dark, but I keep my eyes open, trained on the ceiling fan above us as it creaks in slow circles. I try to count the rotations. Anything to ground myself.

I don’t think about Ethan. I think about my vibrator—the rose-shaped one I keep hidden in my sock drawer. I think about what it feels like when I do it.

When I’m in control. When no one’s panting above me like they’re punching a clock.

Ethan groans, low and tired, and shifts his weight. *Missionary*. Always missionary. He never even tries anything else. I know this rhythm like the back of my hand. Quarterback rhythm. Predictable. All brawn, no finesse.

He used to be the golden boy of our high school—letterman jacket, cleft chin, proud parents in the bleachers. And I guess I was the smart girl who looked good enough on his arm.

We’ve been dating since junior year. Back then, it felt like enough. Being wanted. Being chosen. But now?

Now I lie still, staring blankly while he does his thing, already knowing I won’t come. *Again*.

It’s been years of this.

I’ve wanted to break up with him for a while now, but he’s so… familiar. His voice, his hands, even the smell of his cologne—Axe something, always a little too strong.

I hate change. Always have.

But tonight, I try. I cup his jaw, feeling the sweat gather there. “Babe, can you… go a little harder?” I whisper.

He doesn’t respond. Just keeps moving like a freaking metronome.

“What if we…” I shift under him, angle my hips, try to guide him. “Tried it from behind?”

He pauses. Just for a beat. Then, with a little snort, “No. Why mess with what works?”

My stomach knots. Works for *who*? I bite my lip, trying not to sigh. “Right. Yeah.”

I try to silence the voice in my head. The one that keeps comparing him to the men in the books I secretly read under the covers. Books where the girl gets pinned to the wall, keeps coming wildly over and over again gasping his name.

Where control is a weapon and surrender is earned.

I tell myself to stop reading that crap. Those dark romance novels are fantasy. Fiction. Dangerous, even. But God, at least they make me feel something.

I press my hand against his chest, steadying him. He grunts, annoyed. “What now?”

I hesitated, before finally saying, “What if you… *choked* me?” He stops. Cold. “Like, not hard,” I add quickly, my voice small. “Just a little. It’s a thing. People do it, sometimes...”

Silence. Then his face twists with disgust.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” he says sharply, pulling out of me with a slick sound and rolling off my body like I’m contagious.

I blink at him, stunned. My hands scramble for the sheets, covering my chest even though we’ve done this a hundred times. “Ethan—”

“You seriously just killed the vibe,” he says, grabbing his phone off the nightstand. “You want to be abused during sex now? Jesus, Soph.”

“I didn’t say ‘abused’,” I mumble. “It’s… It’s just some kink, you know. It’s not like—”

“Oh, so now you’re into *freak* shit?” he cuts me off, standing. “What, you want me slapping your face around next? Spit in your mouth? Should I call you a fucking whore while I’m at it?”

Imagining Ethan actually doing it to me made me wet just now. Shit.

“That’s not what I meant,” I whisper, shrinking into myself. My cheeks burn.

“God, this is why I don’t watch porn with you,” he cuts, starting to pace. “You get these ideas in your head from TikTok or some trashy smut book you think I don’t you’re reading and suddenly I’m supposed to what—*dominate* you?”

“I just…” I clutch the sheet tighter. “I’ve rarely come lately, Ethan. I thought maybe—”

“Wow.” He whirls on me. “So this is my fault now?”

“No! I didn’t—”

“You’ve got issues,” he snaps. “Maybe you should think about why you’re even into that shit.”

The words hit like ice water. I sit there, naked and exposed, watching him grab his boxers from the floor. His back is to me now, all rigid shoulders and wounded pride.

“I’m not into anything,” I say, voice barely audible. “I’m just trying to figure out why I feel nothing.”

He freezes mid-step and his voice drops to something dangerous. “Nothing?”

I should backtrack. Should apologize. Should make it okay like I always do. But something snaps.

“Nothing,” I repeat, louder this time. “Three years, Ethan. Last three *fucking* years of faking it because you never once asked if I was enjoying myself.”

He turns around slowly. His face is a storm. “So you’ve been lying to me this whole time?”

“Have you been lying to yourself?” I fire back, surprising us both. “Did you really think those little theatrical moans were real? That I was coming every single time in exactly two minutes like clockwork?”

His jaw works. “You’re being a bitch.”

“No, I’m being honest. Finally.” I stand up, still clutching the sheet. “Do you know what I think about when we have sex?”

He doesn’t answer.

“My grocery list. My sociology paper that’s due Monday. Whether I remembered to turn off the straightener.” My voice is gaining strength. “Literally anything except you!”

“Fuck you, Sophie.”

“You already did. Badly as usual.”

The silence stretches between us like a chasm. He’s staring at me like I’ve grown a second head. Like the girl who’s been accommodating and sweet for years just sprouted fangs.

“You know what?” he says, pulling on his jeans. “You’re right. This is fucked up. We’re fucked up.”

“Finally, something we agree on.”

He grabs his keys from my dresser, movements sharp and angry. “Don’t call me.”

“Wasn’t planning on it.”

The door slams so hard my picture frames rattle.

Chapter 2

“He didn’t make you *come* again, did he?”

Cleo’s voice rang through the apartment like a morning fire alarm—loud, unapologetic, and entirely too on-point for 8:42 a.m. I sat on the kitchen counter in an oversized shirt, nursing my coffee like it was the only stable relationship I had left.

“I heard your stupid rose the whole night,” she added with a smirk, grabbing the oat milk from the fridge.

My cheeks flamed. “Can you not say that like you’re announcing it to the entire floor?”

“Girl, please.” Cleo flipped her curls over her shoulder and leaned against the fridge in nothing but a sports bra and satin boxers. “You think anyone on this floor isn’t already using a vibrator named after a flower? Or a fruit? Get with the times.”

Cleo Rossi had been my roommate since freshman year, which felt like decades ago even though it was only three. We couldn’t be more opposite.

She was a fire—loud, reckless, stunning. Long, dark curls always piled messily on her head, winged liner so sharp it could stab someone, and a wardrobe consisting mostly of crop tops and dangerous confidence.

She wore pleasure like perfume.

Cleo was also getting regularly railed by Ayden Chase, the six-foot-four basketball captain with thighs like carved oak and the attention span of a golden-retriever. They had a situationship built on post-practice visits and broken condoms.

Meanwhile, I had Ethan. Or… maybe didn’t anymore.

I sighed and stared into my coffee. “We got into a fight last night.”

“Shocking.” Cleo raised a brow. “What about this time? Let me guess. You tried to spice things up and he cockblocked you.”

I looked up slowly.

“Oh my god, did he?” she gasped, eyes sparkling. “What’d you do, ask him to pull your hair? Use his words? God forbid.”

“I asked him to choke me,” I mumbled into my cup.

Cleo dropped her oat milk dramatically. “Yes, bitch! You go, girl!” Then narrowed her eyes. “Wait. Did he at least try?”

“No,” I said, voice small. “He freaked out. Rolled off. Said I’m sick and into a freak shit and needed therapy.”

“Oh, please. Princess Ethan?” Cleo snorted so hard it echoed. “That man probably thinks fingering is second base. What did he say exactly?”

I exhaled through my nose. “He said—and I quote—‘You want to be abused during sex now?’”

Cleo slammed the milk on the counter like it personally offended her. “That’s rich, coming from a man who considers foreplay turning off the lights. His dick’s got the personality of a soggy breadstick.”

Despite myself, I laughed. A little too hard. Then suddenly, I almost cried.

Because even though the sex was garbage, Ethan had been my comfort zone. The one consistent thing in a life full of weight I wasn’t ready to carry.

“I don’t know…” I rubbed my hand over my face. “It wasn’t even about the choking. I just wanted something… *more*. Not even crazy. Just to feel something.”

“Soph. It’s not you.” Cleo didn’t flinch. “Ethan’s ego is bigger than his dick, and somehow still less useful. You deserve someone who listens. Who makes you feel seen. Not… serviced.”

I choked on a laugh. “You’re the worst.”

“No, babe. I’m honest.” She grinned. “And I’m glad you’re not with that stupid *shit* anymore. He was the human equivalent of saltless fries.”

The truth clung to my ribs. I’d never dated anyone before Ethan. Never had the time. While other girls went to dances and fumbled through high school romance, I was packing lunches and signing school slips for my sisters.

My dad worked twelve-hour shifts at a steel plant—came home coated in soot and silence. It was always me who filled the gaps.

So when Ethan wanted me, it felt… *safe*. Predictable. Like a role I could play without breaking character. But now that I’d grown into my own mind—into my own body—I realized safety wasn’t the same as satisfaction.

“Come on,” Cleo said, already dressed up and grabbing her keys. “Class in ten. Let’s go get distracted by literature and academic repression.”

I grabbed my bag and followed her out, the morning sun sharp against my tired thoughts. The walk was brisk, leaves crunching underfoot, but my head lagged behind, still stuck in the fog of last night.

As we approached the lecture hall, the buzz of students grew louder, the usual chaos of campus life kicking in, Cleo leaned in, whispering, “Did you hear the rumors?”

“What rumors?”

“Our new professor. Apparently he’s, like, hotty *hot*. But also terrifying. Ayden said he made someone cry in a grad seminar last semester just by correcting their syntax.”

""Sounds fun,"" I muttered, already mentally preparing for academic torture.

But the moment he walked in, I felt it.

The entire room held its breath. Conversations died mid-sentence. Even Jessica, who never shuts up about her weekend hookups, went silent. It wasn't just his looks—though fuck, those were undeniable.

It was something deeper. Predatory, almost.

He moved like a serpent. Sharp black button-down that probably cost more than my textbooks, perfectly tailored slacks that screamed *‘I have my shit together in ways you can't even imagine,’* and eyes so cold they could freeze your GPA mid-semester.

No smile. No friendly professor bullshit. Just pure, undiluted control.

He dropped his briefcase—leather, expensive, the kind that makes a statement when it hits the desk. Adjusted his cuffs like he was preparing for surgery.

Then he stared at us. Not looked. Stared. Like we were specimens under a microscope.

""Literature,"" he said, voice smooth as aged whiskey but cutting like a blade, ""is the science of manipulation. I am Professor Adrian Lewis. Let's begin.""

My heart did this weird stutter-step thing.

He was older—late thirties, maybe early forties. But not in that pathetic way where professors try too hard to relate to students. This was different. Confident. Magnetic in the most dangerous possible way.

Stern jawline, dark hair with silver threading through the temples like he'd earned every strand through sheer intellectual dominance. Eyes that didn't just see you—they dissected you, catalogued your weaknesses, strip you bare.

He didn't scan the room like normal professors do. He *dissected* it. Each glance was surgical, precise, calculating.

Fifteen minutes into his opening lecture about power dynamics in Victorian novels, my phone buzzed against my thigh. I shouldn't have looked. Every functioning brain cell screamed *don't do it*. But my hand moved anyway, muscle memory overriding common sense.

A DM from someone I didn't know. Private profile. Generic name. One photo that made my stomach drop into my shoes.

*Ethan*. His tongue halfway down some brunette's throat in what looked like the hallway outside Delta Phi.

The caption: “*Is this your boyfriend? I’m sorry but I thought you should know.”*

I gasped. Too loud. Way too fucking loud. Heads swiveled and Professor Lewis's granite eyes locked onto me with laser precision.

""If something is more important than my lecture, please, share with the class.""

My breath caught somewhere between my lungs and my throat. ""I'm sorry—""

""Then show it by leaving quietly. And don't return until you're capable of basic attention.""

Dead silence. Even the air conditioning seemed to hold its breath.

Cleo's hand found mine under the desk, squeezing hard. But the damage was done. Professor Lewis had already moved on, dismissed me like I was nothing.

After class, Cleo cornered me by the stairwell. ""You okay?""

I just showed her the photo.

Her jaw went rigid. ""Fuck him. We're going out tonight.""

Chapter 3

“Another shot,” I declare, slamming the empty glass onto my vanity with more force than necessary.

Cleo raises an eyebrow from where she’s sprawled across my bed, already three shots deep. “Babe, we haven’t even left yet. Pace yourself.”

“I’m pacing myself perfectly,” I lie, reaching for the vodka bottle. “This is called pre-gaming with intention.”

She laughs, rolling over to watch me apply another layer of mascara. “Intention to what? Black out before eleven?”

“Intention to forget the five years of my life I’ve spent on that asshole.” The mascara wand trembles slightly in my hand. “Is that too much to ask?”

“Fair point.” She sits up, studying my reflection. “Damn, Soph. You look incredible.”

I step back from the mirror, taking in the full effect.

The black bodycon dress hugs every curve, stopping just below mid-thigh. The plunging neckline is borderline scandalous—definitely not something I would’ve worn with Ethan. The strappy heels add four inches to my height and make my legs look endless.

“I feel like someone else,” I admit.

“Good. That was the point.” Cleo bounces off the bed, smoothing down her own outfit—a crimson slip dress that makes her look like a vintage movie star.

“Tonight, you’re not Ethan’s ex-girlfriend. You’re not the responsible one. You’re just Sophie, and Sophie gets to do whatever the fuck she wants. And to fuck whoever she wants too.”

“What if I don’t know what I want?” I whispered.

“Then you’ll figure it out. That’s what tonight’s for,” she said, taking my hands and leading me to the entrance door.

The club hits us like a wall of sound and sensation. Bass pounds through my chest, making my ribs vibrate. Colored lights strobe across bodies pressed together on the dance floor, creating a kaleidoscope of movement and shadow.

“This place is insane,” I shout over the music.

Cleo grins, grabbing my hand. “I know the owner. VIP treatment all night, baby.”

We push through the crowd, and I’m already feeling the effects of our pre-gaming session. Everything feels heightened—the music, the lights, the way strange eyes track my movement through the crowd.

The VIP section is a different world entirely. Plush velvet couches surround low tables, and several hookah pipes bubble gently, filling the air with sweet, flavored smoke.

We settle onto a deep purple couch, and spend the next hour in a haze of conversations. The guy—who joined us at some point—is charming enough, but I find myself distracted. Every time someone walks by, I catch myself looking for something, though I’m not sure what.

“I need another drink,” I announce, standing too quickly. The room spins.

“Girl,” Cleo gives me a look. “I’ll come with you.”

“No, stay. I can handle a trip to the bar.”

*Famous last words.*

I make it halfway down the stairs before the combination of alcohol, hookah smoke, and flashing lights catches up with me. The world tilts violently, and I stumble, my heel catching on the step.

Strong hands catch me around the waist, steadying me before I can fall. “Easy there.”

I look up into the face of a stranger—at least, I think he’s a stranger because I can’t see a shit in this half darkness with my hazed eyes.

There’s actually something familiar about him, but my alcohol-soaked brain can’t place it.

“Thanks,” I manage, acutely aware that his hands are still on my waist.

“You okay?”

“Just peachy.” I try to step back, but my legs aren’t cooperating. “Little too much liquid courage.”

“When’s the last time you had water?”

I blink at him. “Water?”

“Come on.” He doesn’t ask—just guides me toward a quieter corner of the club where the music isn’t quite so overwhelming. “Stay here.”

He disappears into the crowd and returns minutes later with a bottle of water, already opened.

“Drink,” he commands. Something about his tone makes me obey without question. The water is cold and perfect, and I didn’t realize how thirsty I was until I started drinking. “Better?”

“Much.” I study his face, the parts of it actually, underneath his mask that I can see now. “Not many men in here care whether I’m coherent.”

He leans closer, close enough that I can smell his cologne—something dark and expensive.

“That’s because they don’t want to earn you.”

The words hit me like a physical thing. When’s the last time someone wanted to earn me?

“Dance with me,” he says, and again, it’s not really a question.

He leads me onto the dance floor, and suddenly we’re surrounded by bodies and music and heat. His hands find my waist, pulling me against him, and I go willingly. He leads, and I follow, our bodies finding a rhythm and everything to do with the electricity crackling between us.

One song bleeds into another, and we don’t stop moving. His hands are respectful but possessive, resting on my hips, occasionally sliding up to the small of my back.

When he spins me around, pressing my back against his chest, I can feel his heart beating against my shoulder blade.

“You’re trouble,” he murmurs against my ear, his breath warm against my skin.

“Good,” I breathe back. “I’m tired of being safe.”

He turns me around to face him, and the intensity in his eyes nearly makes me stumble again. This time, it has nothing to do with alcohol.

“Can I ask you something crazy?” The words tumble out before I can stop them. He nods, his eyes never leaving mine. “Don’t be gentle with me,” I whisper. “Just… make me feel something.”

For a moment, he just stares at me. Then his hand comes up to cup my jaw, thumb brushing across my bottom lip. “Are you sure?”

Instead of answering, I rise up on my toes and kiss him.

The kiss is electric, demanding, nothing like the careful pecks I’m used to. He kisses like he means it, like he wants to consume me, and I let him. His hands tangle in my hair, and I press closer, wanting more contact, more heat, more everything.

When we break apart, we’re both breathing hard.

“Come with me,” he says, and I nod without hesitation.

He leads me through the crowd toward a section marked VIP, past velvet ropes and security guards who nod at him like they know him.

The private room is dimly lit, furnished with plush couches and low tables. The music is muffled here, creating an intimate bubble away from the chaos outside.

The moment the door closes behind us, he has me pressed against the wall, his mouth on mine again. This time there’s no hesitation, no careful exploration. His hands gripped my face like he couldn’t bear space between us, then slid down, gripping my waist, pulling me flush to him.

I can feel every hard line of his body, and it makes me dizzy with want. This is what I’ve been missing—this fire, this desperate need that makes everything else fade away.

My breath hitched as his fingers slid beneath the hem, hooked into my panties, and yanked them down. His palm pressed between my thighs, fingers finding my slick heat without hesitation.

He didn’t ask. He *knew*.

I cried out, and he swallowed it with his mouth, devouring my gasp as his fingers sank deep inside me—*thrusting*, curling, relentless.

One hand at my throat, just enough pressure to keep me pinned to the wall, the other between my legs, dragging moans out of me like he had every right to them.

He twisted his fingers and I nearly collapsed. But he didn’t let me fall.

Instead, he *spun* me.

Before I could blink, my cheek hit the wall, cool and jarring. One palm curled around the back of my head, his other hand slipping right back between my thighs like it had never left.

I was gone. Floating. Writhing between him and the wall like nothing else existed.

My fingers scrambled uselessly at the flat surface, lips parted in a silent moan. My body bucked. My mind blurred. There was *nothing* but him. The way his fingers filled me, stretched me, how the pressure in my core coiled tight, tighter, *burning*—

My phone rings, shrill and insistent, cutting through the moment like a knife.

*Cleo’s ringtone.*

Reality crashes back into me like cold water. I’m in a private room with a stranger, drunk and completely out of my mind with lust.

“I have to—” I start, but he’s already stepping back, giving me space.

“Go,” he says simply.

I grab my phone with shaking hands. “Cleo?”

“Sophie, where the hell are you? I’ve been looking everywhere!”

“I’m… I was just…” I look at him, standing there in his leather mask, looking like every dark fantasy I’ve ever had. “I’m coming to find you,” I say finally, not taking my eyes off him.

“Good. I’ll be by the bar.”

I hung up and didn’t even look at him before telling helplessly, “I have to go.”

I smooth down my dress and head for the door. As I stumbled out, I could feel wetness trailing down my thighs, heels clacking like gunshots on the tile and heart threatening to explode.

Chapter 4

I couldn’t stop thinking about his hands.

Not just the way they moved—though Christ, they moved like they had a PhD in finding every nerve ending I didn’t know existed.

Mostly, it was the way he touched me like he already owned me, like my body was a language he’d been fluent in for years.

Twenty-four hours later, and I could still feel the phantom pressure of his fingers against my throat, inside me. The way he made me want to forget my own name and beg for his.

My vibrator had been working overtimes since I got back to the apartment, but it felt like trying to scratch an itch with oven mitts.

Wrong texture. Wrong rhythm. Wrong everything.

“Earth to Space, Cadet Sophie,” Cleo’s voice cut through my spiral, and I realized I’d been standing in our kitchen for god knows how long, coffee mug halfway to my lips, probably looking like I’d been lobotomized.

“Sorry,” I mumbled, taking a sip of what had apparently gone cold. “Just thinking.”

“Thinking?” Cleo snorted, hopping onto the counter with her legs swinging. “Babe, that wasn’t thinking. That was full-body reminiscing. You had that same glazed look you get when you watch those TikToks of guys doing construction work.”

Heat crept up my neck. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Right. And I don’t masturbate to Audio Porn on Reddit.” She grinned wickedly. “So, scale of one to ten, how thoroughly did Mystery Man rearrange your internal furniture?”

I choked on my coffee. “Jesus, Cleo.”

“What? I’m invested now. You disappeared for like twenty minutes. Then you show up at the bar looking like you’d been hit by a very *attractive* truck.” Her eyes narrowed. “Also, your panties were missing.”

My face went nuclear. “How did you—”

“Because I know you, Sophie. You’re the girl who wears matching bra and panty sets to the gynecologist ‘just in case.’ You don’t just lose underwear unless something very interesting happened to it.”

I buried my face in my hands. “This is not a conversation I’m ready to have.”

“Too bad. I’ve been waiting twenty-four hours for details, and I’m about to combust from curiosity.” She leaned forward conspiratorially. “Was he big? Did he make you come? Did you make those weird squeaky noises you deny making?”

“That’s it, I am leaving,” I announced, grabbing my overnight bag from where I’d dropped it by the door.

“Running away to Daddy’s house won’t make your lady boner disappear!” Cleo called after me. “But hey, maybe some good old-fashioned family dysfunction will distract you from the fact that you finally had decent foreplay and then ran away like Cinderella with commitment issues.”

I flipped her off without turning around, but she wasn’t wrong.

My family was chaos incarnate, and right now, chaos sounded better than sitting here obsessing over a man whose name I didn’t even know.

The two-hour train ride to my dad’s house should have been peaceful. Should have been time to decompress, read a book, maybe catch up on some work.

Instead, I spent it staring out the window, replaying every second of what happened in that VIP room. The way he’d made me feel like the only woman in existence while simultaneously making me forget I was supposed to be a *good* girl.

By the time I reached my stop, I was wound tighter than a spring and probably radiating enough sexual frustration to power a small city.

Home sweet chaos.

The front door wasn’t even fully open before my dad launched himself at me like I was a life preserver and he was drowning in estrogen and elementary school drama.

“Sophie, thank God,” he wheezed, wrapping me in a hug. “I think I’m having a nervous breakdown.”

From somewhere deeper in the house came the sound of my little sister Abby shriek-crying like she was being murdered by cartoon characters. Madison, my middle sister, was nowhere to be seen, which meant she was either dead, in jail, or locked in her room plotting someone else’s demise.

“What happened?” I asked, already mentally rolling up my sleeves.

“Madison got suspended for cutting off some girl’s ponytail with safety scissors,” Dad said, running his hands through his hair until it stuck up at odd angles. “Abby’s been crying for three hours because her favorite Barbie doesn’t have a head anymore—don’t ask—and I burned dinner because I forgot the stove was on while I was trying to untangle Christmas lights in *fucking* March.”

I blinked. “Christmas lights?”

“Madison said they were fairy lights for her room, but they’re clearly Christmas lights, and now they’re somehow tangled around the ceiling fan and I think I might have accidentally created a fire hazard.”

This was my life. Had always been my life.

Mom walked out when I was thirteen, and I’d been the unofficial family crisis manager ever since. I was the one who remembered to buy groceries, who knew which sister needed which type of hug, who could negotiate peace treaties between teenage hormones and elementary school meltdowns.

I was twenty-two years old, and I’d been mothering my own family for almost a decade.

“Okay,” I said, dropping my bag and switching into crisis mode. “Go sit down. Pour yourself something stronger than coffee. I’ve got this.”

Three hours later, I’d successfully negotiated a ceasefire between Madison and reality after she came home from detention, convinced Abby that headless Barbie was just “practicing for Halloween,” untangled the Christmas lights without electrocuting anyone, and made a dinner that didn’t require calling the fire department.

Madison was curled up next to me on the couch now, her head on my shoulder, finally admitting that maybe slashing her ex-boyfriend’s tires hadn’t been her most mature moment.

“I just felt so stupid,” she mumbled into my sweater. “Everyone at school saw him with that *bitch* Debby Lister, and I just… snapped.”

“I get it,” I said, stroking her hair. “Heartbreak makes you do crazy things.”

“Have you ever done crazy things because of a guy?”

I thought about that night. About kissing a stranger. About letting him touch me in ways that still made my thighs clench together. About running away before I could find out his name or whether what I felt was real or just really good alcohol and better hands.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “I have.”

By the time Dad had fallen asleep on the recliner and both girls were tucked into their respective beds, I was emotionally drained and physically exhausted. I grabbed a glass of wine—okay, fine, I grabbed the bottle—and slipped out onto the back porch.

The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in hours, I could breathe without someone needing something from me. I settled into the old porch swing, tucking my bare feet under me, and let myself just exist for a minute.

This was my pattern. Take care of everyone else until I was running on empty, then steal moments like this to remember I was still a person with my own wants and needs and desires.

Desires that, apparently, included mysterious strangers with commanding voices and hands that knew exactly how to make me forget my own name.

My phone buzzed with a message from the *Unknown number.* Strange.

I opened it and saw that the message itself wasn’t words. Just a photo.

My black lace panties, delicate and unmistakable, held in a large, masculine hand. I nearly dropped my wine before the second message followed immediately:

*Unknown: You left these behind, Cinderella.*

1mh6ac0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1mh6ac0/late_night/,Late Night,"I'm so glad to see that you're all feeling happy. The summer is meant to be enjoyed and free of worry. I can't avoid how it feels though, to have lost your respect, your gentleness, and I'm scared I've lost your love. It's a love that brings me a sense of purpose and challenge to do better than I say I should.

I will always love you.

From the very start of when you passed me by, before I knew your name, until the day my lungs fail to breathe. 

I will be a better man. I know I can, I've improved before. I'm trying my best and I know it will be a long road, but if it leads me back to you, to bring peace instead of pain,  I will drag myself through it if I have to. Your worth is unmatched to anyone out there, and the children bring a joy and fulfilment in ways I had never thought I'd be blessed to experience.

I know I have my faults and some are quite upsetting, but please remember the good I do, the good I am able to do, and the work I'm always willing to do. You've only ever tried to help me believe in myself, to relieve my pains, planning our goals in what we want for our family. Sometimes I worry I will fail you, that I won't be strong enough, that I'll ruin everything. I already feel as though I have, like a sad, broken human addled with regret. Please don't take my efforts to be cheap conjurations to lure you back to me. I want the results to bring you back to me to feel safe again. It may be asking for more than you feel up to allowing, but I can only ask for forgiveness, grace, to know that I will never bring harm in any way ever again. 

I understand how you feel. I accept it, I'm not upset at you for your feelings, nor am I desperately asking you for the answers, as I know what I need to do. I have my feelings as well, they demand to be felt. To feel like my heart is bleeding from rigid ribs like a cage, pouring into every inch of me that wants to hear your voice, see your texts, see you laugh, the way you'd smile at me, our little lunch dates and hot coffee with FRIENDS, the weekend dinners and football games, sleeping in each other's arms, stopping time, knowing there was no greater comfort. To feel connected is to feel loved, to know you feel safe and can be your fun-loving self without anger, without disappointment, fear or dread. I can be taxing to be around, I understand. I want to be a gentle man, who can promise and follow through. My resolve is through pain in knowing I've let you down in ways we had promised each other not to. 

The love I have for you is without fault or bounds. And while I won't ignore how you feel, while I'll never forget the look of your eyes, I can't help but feel the chain of my grief and regret, my shame, and the loudest of all in given pain to those who didn't deserve it, because all of my love has no place to go, no hand to hold, no closeness, as it wanders the remnant chambers, like a ghost of what we had before hurt.",1,1754289839.0,UnsentTexts,1,1.0,False

POV Noelle

This is either the best or worst decision I’ve ever made.

I’m staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, and honestly? I look like trouble wrapped in designer labels.

The dress is criminally short, the neckline plunges to somewhere around my naval, and if I bend over, I’m showing the entire world everything God gave me.

Dad would *fucking* hate this outfit.

Which is exactly the point.

See, Daddy dearest has been MIA for six weeks now. Singapore, then London, then some oil conference in Dubai that was apparently more important than his daughter’s existence.

The man who used to read me bedtime stories and teach me how to ride bikes now communicates through wire transfers and his assistant’s carefully worded emails.

*‘Miss Morris, your father sends his regards and hopes you’re doing well in your studies.’*

Yeah, well. His regards can go *fuck* themselves.

I’ve been the perfect daughter for twenty-two years.

Perfect grades, perfect behavior, perfect little princess locked away in her ivory tower. And what do I get? Radio silence and a black card with no limit.

So tonight? Tonight I’m going all out and that includes finally losing my stupid virginity to my boyfriend.

The vodka burns warm and familiar as I navigate through the packed house. Bodies pressed together like sardines, music thumping so loud I can feel it in my bones. This isn’t my scene—I’m more of a curl-up-with-a-book-and-expensive-wine kind of girl.

But desperate times call for desperate measures.

“Noelle! Get your perfect ass over here!”

Jamie’s voice cuts through the chaos like a blade through butter.

My best friend stands near the kitchen island, looking effortlessly stunning in his fitted black shirt and designer jeans that cost him one evening of shouting with his mother about trashing out money.

He’s got that rare combination of devastating good looks and the confidence to use them on anyone who catches his eye.

“You look like you’re about to make catastrophically bad decisions,” he says, pulling me into a hug that smells like expensive cologne and safety.

“That’s literally the plan.” I steal his drink and take a sip. Whiskey. Of course. “Speaking of bad decisions, see anyone interesting?”

His eyes light up with that mischievous spark that usually means trouble. “Oh, honey. There’s this man by the fireplace who just obliterated my entire sense of self-worth.”

I follow his gaze to a figure in all black, standing apart from the crowd like he’s carved from shadows and bad intentions.

Much older than the college crowd—probably late thirties. Dark hair, sharp jaw, and an aura that screams ‘*I could end your entire existence without breaking a sweat.’*

“Did you try the full Jamie-charm offensive?”

“I tried everything short of actual nudity. He looked at me like I was a mildly interesting houseplant.” Jamie sighs dramatically. “I’m deeply attracted to his please-harder-Daddy vibes and complete indifference to my existence. It’s problematic.”

I laugh, but it dies in my throat when familiar hands slide around my waist from behind.

“There’s my girl.”

Warren’s voice is honey-smooth against my ear, but his grip feels possessive. Claiming. Like I’m already his property, which, let’s be honest, I probably am.

Warren was my boyfriend for three months now, ever since he noticed me crying in the library after Dad missed another one of my award ceremonies.

He swooped in with his perfect smile and his daddy’s money, offering comfort and validation I was too desperate to question.

“Miss me?” I tilt my head back against his shoulder, playing the part I’ve perfected over months of this toxic dance.

“Always.” His fingers trace patterns on my hip that feel more like ownership than affection. “I have a surprise for you upstairs, babygirl.”

The thing about Warren is that he’s perfect on paper.

Rich family, law school bound, abs that could cut glass. But there’s something cold behind his smile, something that makes my skin crawl even as I lean into his embrace because I’m apparently allergic to self-preservation.

He fills the void Dad left behind, gives me the attention I crave, makes me feel wanted in a way that’s probably unhealthy but addictive as hell.

Every red flag looks pink through rose-colored glasses, right?

Jamie’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline. He mouths “*Are you sure?*” and I nod, even though my stomach does a weird flip that has nothing to do with the alcohol.

Warren’s hand is firm on my lower back as he guides me through the crowd, his fingers spread like he owns me. The music throbs beneath our feet, drowning out every rational thought screaming at me to run.

We climb the stairs, leaving behind the packed living room and half-dressed strangers grinding against walls. Up here, the air is quieter. Thicker.

He opens a door to what looks like someone’s bedroom. Bed unmade, a hoodie slung over the desk chair, someone’s cologne still lingering in the air. But something’s wrong. Immediately.

The room isn’t empty.

Marcus and Tyler from Warren’s usual crew sit on the bed and window ledge like they’ve been waiting. My designer heels stutter on the threshold.

“Warren?” I say, voice smaller than intended. “What’s going on?”

The door clicks shut behind me. Heavy. Mechanical. The lock slides into place like the closing of a coffin lid, and my breath catches.

“Relax, Noelle.” Warren’s voice has shifted—gone is the silk, replaced by sandpaper. “You’ve been teasing all of us for months. Time to stop pretending you don’t like the attention.”

My pulse spikes. There’s a laptop open on the desk, its camera lens pointed squarely at the bed.

And that’s when it hits me.

The drink. The one he insisted on getting me. The one I took only a few sips from before we came upstairs.

“You’ve been begging for this in that little dress of yours,” Warren continues, eyes raking over me like I’m a buffet meant to be shared. “You knew exactly what you were doing.”

I step back, but Marcus moves in, casually blocking the door. Tyler stands too, arms folded, gaze flat and unreadable.

Predators, all of them.

“I want to leave,” I say, voice shaking. “Open the *fucking* door.”

“No one’s leaving until we get our content,” Tyler says, and the way he says it makes bile rise in my throat.

“Warren, let me out. Please.”

“Come on, Noelle,” he says, voice colder than I’ve ever heard it. “Don’t be a prude. You can't tell me you haven't thought about it. We all know *you want this*.”

When he lunges, I scream—loud, raw, terrified. But even before he gets to touch me, before he gets any chance, the door explodes inward with a thunderous crack.

The lock shatters like glass. Wood splinters fly and everyone freezes.

The man from downstairs—the one Jamie was obsessing over—stands in the ruined doorway, dressed in black, his frame backlit by the hallway light like some vengeful god.

The room drops ten degrees when he finally speaks. His voice is calm. Casual. Deadly.

“Which one of you wants to die first?”

Warren stumbles back, all that cocky swagger crumbling like wet paper. “Who the *fuck* are you—?”

The man moves before Warren finishes the sentence.

A blur of motion. A fist connects with Tyler’s jaw—the crack is wet and final. Marcus tries to run but doesn’t even make it to the door. Warren lunges for the desk and gets a knee to the gut that folds him like origami.

One scream. Then nothing but whimpers and groans.

My back is pressed to the wall, knees buckled, my heart a live grenade in my chest. The man turns to me, expression unreadable. Controlled.

“Your father sent me.”

Chapter 2

POV Owen

There's one thing I fucking hate, and that's babysitting bratty spoiled daughters.

This is not what I signed up for when Michael called in old friendship favors. When I heard the name Morris, I knew exactly what kind of bad news was heading my way.

He called three weeks ago, and I figured he'd want me to eliminate someone.

Maybe a rival dealer, maybe a witness, maybe just someone who'd looked at him wrong. That's the usual currency in our world—blood for blood, life for life.

But this? This is somehow worse.

Michael and I go way back. We're almost the same age, did business together on occasion, shared drinks and war stories. Professional respect, maybe even real friendship.

But in all our interactions, he never once mentioned having a daughter. Smart man.

In our line of work, family is a liability you keep buried deeper than your enemies. Now I know why he hid her so carefully.

Because Noelle Morris is literally a walking sin. I've been watching her for an hour, and she's been a masterclass in bad decisions.

The dress that barely qualifies as fabric, the way she moves like she owns every room she enters, the complete lack of situational awareness that comes with being daddy's protected princess.

She's beautiful in that dangerous way that makes smart men stupid and stupid men dead.

The pretty boy with the perfect smile—Warren something—leads her upstairs, and every instinct I've honed over the years starts screaming.

I give them thirty seconds before I follow.

The door's locked when I reach it, but locks are suggestions when you know what you're doing. I hear her scream through the wood, and that's all I need.

The door frame splinters under my shoulder like it's made of cardboard.

Three guys, one girl, one laptop recording everything. The math is simple, and so is the solution.

I don't fight. I execute. The whole thing takes maybe fifteen seconds.

When the dust settles, Noelle's pressed against the wall, shaking like a leaf in a hurricane. Her eyes are wide and unfocused—whatever they slipped her is kicking in hard.

""Your father sent me,"" I tell her, shrugging out of my coat.

She stares at me like I’m speaking a foreign language and I can see her one remaining brain cell struggling to process what just happened.

""My father sent you? Who the hell are you?""

""Owen.""

""Owen who?""

""Owen Tate. I'm an old friend of your father.""

""Right.” Her laugh is bitter and sharp. “Because my dad has so many friends who just happen to show up at frat parties.""

I wrap my coat around her shoulders. She tries to shrug it off, but her coordination is shot.

""Don't touch me. I'm not going anywhere with you."" She attempts to stand and immediately stumbles. ""I don't know you.""

""Your father—""

""My father what? Sent his goon to drag me home? This is such bullshit."" I reach for her, and she swats at my hands. ""I said don't touch me.""

I lift her into my arms before she can protest further. She's smaller than I expected, all sharp angles and delicate bones, but she fights me like a wildcat.

""Put me down right now,"" she mumbles, but there’s no strength behind it.

“Not happening.”

I carry her down the stairs, and she starts getting mouthy. She goes quiet for a moment, and I think maybe the drugs are finally winning. Then she starts up again.

Even drunk and traumatized, she’s still got an attitude.

“You’re very tall though,” she observes, like she’s just noticed. ""And this is kidnapping, you know.""

I carry her to the car, and she provides commentary the entire way. About how this is ""literally the worst night of my life,"" how I ""smell like violence and lust,"" and how she's ""definitely calling the cops.""

Christ. Even roofied, she’s a smart-ass.

""Are you going to kill me?"" she asks as we finally reach the car, and there’s something almost curious about the way she says it.

""No.""

“Good. I have plans tomorrow.”

I slide her into the passenger seat and she immediately starts messing with the radio, turning knobs randomly. “This car smells like leather and bad guys,” she announces.

“Just leather.”

“No, definitely bad guys. I can smell them.”

The drive to the Morris estate takes twenty minutes, and she argues with me the entire way.

About why she doesn't need protection because *""I'm not a child"",* why this is illegal with *""Pretty sure this violates my constitutional rights""*, and why her father is *""literally the worst person on the planet.""*

""How do you even know my dad?"" she asks, staring out the window.

""We've done business together.""

""What kind of business?""

""The kind you don't ask questions about.""

""You keep saying that.""

""Because it keeps being true.""

""Are you in the mafia?""

""There's no mafia.""

""Are you a drug dealer?""

""No.""

""Are you a hitman?""

I don't answer that one.

""Oh my god, you're a hitman."" Her voice goes up an octave. ""My father hired a hitman to be my bodyguard. This is insane. This is actually insane.""

""I'm not hired.""

""Right, you're doing a favor. What kind of favor involves babysitting someone you've never met?""

""The kind where old friends call in debts.""

""What debt?""

""The kind you don't—""

""Ask questions about, yeah yeah, I see."" She slumps in her seat. ""This is really so fucked up…""

The Morris mansion rises before us like something out of a novel—all marble columns and perfectly manicured gardens. A monument to family money and power built on blood and bullets.

""Home sweet prison,"" she mutters as I carry her up the front steps.

""Can you walk?""

""I can do lots of things. Walking might be one of them.""

I set her down gently, and she immediately stumbles into the marble foyer.

The place is obscenely expensive—crystal chandeliers, imported Italian tile, artwork that costs more than most people's houses.

""Welcome to the Morris mausoleum,"" she says, throwing her arms wide and nearly toppling over.

I catch her elbow before she face-plants into a million-dollar vase. ""Let's go. Your room.""

We start climbing the grand staircase, her heels clacking unevenly against the steps. She leans against the banister like gravity's got a personal vendetta.

We start climbing, her heels clacking unevenly against the steps.

At the top of the stairs, I guide her down the hallway toward the guest wing. Her room's at the end—white furniture, floor-to-ceiling windows, all of it too pristine to feel lived in.

I get her to the bed. She flops down, limbs splayed like a rag doll, then curls up on her side.

""Owen?""

""What now?""

""When I wake up tomorrow, are you still going to be here?""

""Yes.""

""Are you going to be here every day?""

""Yes.""

""Are you going to ruin my life?""

I pause at the door. ""I'm going to keep you safe.""

""Same thing,"" she mutters into her pillow.

I look back at her, small and vulnerable in her designer prison, and I feel something I haven’t felt in years. Something that might be sympathy.

But then I remember who she is. Who her father is. What I’m here to do.

I close the door behind me and lean against it, running a hand through my hair. There’s one thing I hate, and that’s babysitting bratty spoiled daughters.

Looks like I’m going to be doing a lot of things I hate.

Chapter 3

POV Noelle

My alarm is having a full-blown seizure at 8:47 AM, and honestly? Same energy.

I slam my hand down on the nightstand, missing my phone three times before finally murdering the demonic shrieking. Twenty minutes. I have exactly twenty minutes to get to Riverside Children's Shelter for tutoring.

Fuck my entire life.

I'm throwing on jeans and a Princeton sweatshirt when my phone starts buzzing like it's possessed.

""Bitch, where are you?!""

Jamie's voice could shatter reinforced glass and I had to hold the phone away from my ear. ""Jesus Christ, Jamie. Indoor voice.""

""Don't Jesus Christ me! I've been texting you for hours! You disappeared with Warren and I thought you were finally getting properly laid.""

""I'm home.""

""Boring. Tell me about the good stuff."" I can practically hear him vibrating with excitement. ""Is your cherry popped? Do I need to come over with a cake that says 'Cherry Popped'? Because I absolutely will, and I'll make sure it's shaped like a di—""

""Nothing good happened.""

There's a long silence before he speaks again, ""What do you mean nothing good happened? You left with Warren Nielsen looking like you were about to climb him like a fucking tree.""

""It was a setup."" The words taste like ash and betrayal. ""A really fucking elaborate setup.""

""Setup how? Like performance anxiety? Because honestly, guys like Warren are usually all swagger and no substance when it comes to—""

""Jamie."" I cut him off before he can launch into one of his doctoral dissertations on toxic masculinity. ""Warren tried to assault me. Him and his buddies. They even had cameras set up.""

Dead fucking silence from his side for what felt like eternity.

And then finally: ""I'm going to castrate these fuckers with a rusty spoon.""

""Get in line.""

I check my reflection—still look like I went ten rounds with a blender, but the kids have seen worse.

""But it's fine. I'm officially done with Warren fucking Nielsen. Should've listened to my gut instead of my daddy issues.""

""Good. He was manipulative trust-fund-baby trash anyway."" Jamie's voice goes from murderous to curious. ""Wait, how did you get out?""

""Remember that man you were eye-fucking at the party and get cockblocked?""

""The one who made my dick rock hard and had my panties in a twist?""

""That's the one. Owen Tate, meet my new bodyguard.""

Jamie's shriek nearly ruptures my eardrum. ""You're fucking kidding me! Your father hired a bodyguard without telling you?""

""Just another executive decision made without consulting the person it affects most."" I pause at my door. ""Anyway, I have to go. The kids are waiting.""

""Wait, what kids?""

""Shelter kids. I tutor on Saturdays, remember? Math and reading help for kids who've been separated from their families.""

""Oh right. Your guilt-driven community service.""

""It's not guilt-driven, it's—"" I pause. ""Okay, it's partially guilt-driven. But those kids need help, and I'm annoyingly good at explaining why X equals whatever the fuck X equals.""

I hang up and take a breath. Time to face whatever fresh hell awaits me.

I open my door and immediately want to crawl back into bed.

Owen stands directly across from my doorway like some kind of well-dressed sentinel. Fresh clothes, perfect hair, looking like he stepped out of a magazine spread instead of spending his night beating up college boys.

""Going somewhere?"" His voice is calm, controlled, like stalking me is just another Tuesday.

""Yes. Away from you."" I lock my door and start walking toward the stairs, but he falls into step beside me like a shadow with commitment issues.

""I'll drive you then.""

""I have a car.""

""And I have a job to do.""

""And I have a functioning brain.""

""Debatable.""

I stop dead in the hallway and turn to face him. ""Excuse me?""

""You walked into an obvious trap last night. Your decision-making skills are questionable at best.""

""Oh, fuck you."" I spin around and start walking again, but faster this time. ""You don't know anything about me or my life or why I make the choices I make.""

""I know enough.""

""You know nothing."" I'm practically speed-walking now, my anger making me careless. ""You're just some father's old ass friend hired to babysit me because he's too busy making money to actually parent his own daughter.""

The words taste bitter, but they're true. Dad would rather pay someone else to care about my safety than actually be present in my life.

I hit the top of the grand staircase still fuming, still walking too fast, still not paying attention to where I'm going.

My foot catches the marble edge wrong, and suddenly I'm airborne.

For a split second, I see my immediate future: tumbling down two flights of stairs, probably breaking my neck in the process.

What a perfectly pathetic way to die—killed by my own anger and expensive flooring.

But then Owen's arm shoots out, catching me around the waist and pulling me back against his chest. We're pressed together for a moment, his hand splayed across my stomach, his breath warm against my ear.

""Careful,"" he says, and his voice is softer than I've ever heard it.

My heart is hammering so hard I'm surprised it doesn't bruise my ribs. ""I'm fine.""

""Humor me."" He guides me to sit on the top step, then crouches down and gently lifts my foot.

His hands are warm and steady as he rotates my ankle, checking for damage with the kind of precision that suggests medical training. Or combat training. Or both.

I get this weird fluttering in my stomach as his fingers brush carefully over my skin.

It's completely inappropriate and absolutely unwelcome, but there it is.

""Does this hurt?"" He applies gentle pressure to the side of my foot, and I have to bite my lip to keep from making a sound that has nothing to do with pain.

""No.""

""How about this?"" His thumb traces along my ankle bone, and I swear to God, I can feel that touch everywhere.

""Fine. It's fine.""

Owen releases my ankle and stands, but he doesn't step back. Instead, he offers me his hand to help me up, and I stare at it for a moment.

Strong fingers, callused palms, hands that know how to fix things. Hands that probably know how to do *a lot more* than basic first aid.

I take his hand, and the contact sends an unwelcome jolt through my system.

His grip is firm, steady, confident. The kind of hands that could probably make a woman forget her own name if he put his mind to it.

Which is a completely inappropriate thought to have about my father's friend.

But I can't help wondering how good those hands would feel if they weren't being professional. If they were touching me because he wanted to, not because he was checking for injuries.

He's still holding my hand, and I'm still letting him.

We're standing way too close, and I can smell his cologne—something expensive and masculine that makes me want to lean into him.

Owen's thumb traces across my knuckles, and I swear it's not accidental. The touch is too deliberate, too careful, too fucking intimate for a bodyguard checking on his client.

""You're going to be late,"" he says, dropping my hand like it burned him.

The moment shatters, leaving me standing there feeling like an idiot.

""Right. The kids."" I adjust my bag, trying to pretend my hands aren't shaking. ""They're waiting.""

""I'll drive you.""

""Fine. But you're staying in the car.""

Owen's smile is sharp as a blade, but there's something else in his eyes now. Something that wasn't there before.

""We'll see about that, angel.""

Christ. I need therapy. Or a cold shower. Or both.

Chapter 4

POV Noelle

Three weeks. Three goddamn weeks of Owen Tate existing in my peripheral vision like some kind of ridiculously attractive surveillance drone.

I can't breathe without him analyzing my lung capacity. Can't order coffee without him scanning the barista for potential threats.

Can't even take a piss without him positioning himself strategically outside the bathroom door like some kind of urinary security detail.

It's psychological warfare disguised as protection, and I'm losing my fucking mind.

""You look like you're about to commit homicide,"" Jamie observes, stirring his oat milk latte with the precision of a chemist. ""And not the fun, crime-of-passion kind. The slow, methodical, body-in-the-freezer kind.""

We're at Grind Coffee, our usual Saturday spot, and Owen is stationed at a corner table with perfect sightlines to our booth.

He's pretending to read some military thriller, but I can feel his attention like a physical weight.

""I'm seriously considering it,"" I mutter, stabbing my blueberry muffin with unnecessary violence.

I’m really pissed off.

""Do you know what he did yesterday? He followed me to my women's studies class. Stood outside the door for the entire two hours. Professor Sanders thought I was being stalked by an ex-boyfriend.""

""Technically, you are being stalked.""

""By my father's friend. Which is somehow worse.""

Jamie's eyes dart to Owen's table, and I watch his pupils dilate slightly. ""Christ, Noelle. Have you actually looked at that man? Like, really looked?""

""Unfortunately, yes. Every fucking day.""

""Those shoulders could probably bench press a small car. And his hands..."" Jamie fans himself dramatically. ""Those are hands that know things. Dirty things. Things that would make you forget your own name.""

Heat creeps up my neck. ""Jamie.""

""What? I'm just saying, if I had to be under constant surveillance, I'd want it to be by someone who looks like he stepped out of a very specific type of pornographic fantasy.""

""He's not a fantasy. He's a nightmare with good bone structure.""

""Bullshit."" Jamie leans forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""You're telling me you haven't thought about it? Haven't wondered what it would be like to…""

""To what?""

""To fuck him.""

The word hits me like a physical blow. Heat floods my cheeks, and I'm pretty sure my heart just attempted to escape via my throat.

""I haven't— That's not— He's my father's friend!""

""So?""

""So it's inappropriate.""

""Inappropriate is my middle name, babe. Well, technically it's Sebastian, but you get the idea.""

I glance toward Owen's table. He's still pretending to read, but there's something about the set of his shoulders that suggests he's hyper-aware of our conversation.

Can he hear us? Does he know we're talking about him?

""Besides,"" Jamie continues, ""you're twenty-two. He's what, thirty-five? Forty? That's not actually illegal, it's just hot.""

""It's complicated.""

""The best sex always is."" Jamie's grin is absolutely wicked. ""And speaking of sex, when was the last time you got properly laid? And don't say Warren, because we both know that disaster doesn't count.""

My face burns. ""That's not relevant.""

""Oh, honey. It's completely relevant. You're walking around with all this pent-up sexual tension, and you've got a walking sex god following you everywhere. It's like cosmic irony.""

""I'm not sexually frustrated.""

""You're a twenty-two-year-old virgin who's been living like a nun for three weeks. If you're not sexually frustrated, you're clinically dead.""

The virgin thing hits like a slap. Jamie's the only person who knows, and he wields the information like a weapon when he thinks I'm being stupid.

""You know what your problem is?"" he says, leaning back in his chair. ""You're thinking about this all wrong.""

""How am I thinking about it?""

""Like a victim. Like you're powerless."" His eyes gleam with mischief. ""But you're not. You're Noelle fucking Morris. You're smart, you're gorgeous, and you've got daddy issues that could power a small city. Use it.""

""Use what?""

""Your power, idiot. Seduce him.""

I choke on my coffee. ""I'm sorry, what?""

""You heard me. Seduce Owen Tate. Sleep with him. Rock his world so hard he forgets his own name.""

""That's insane.""

""Is it? Think about it logically. You want him gone, right? Well, what's the fastest way to get daddy dearest to fire a bodyguard?""

The pieces click into place with terrifying clarity. ""Inappropriate conduct.""

""Exactly. The minute Michael Morris finds out his precious daughter fucked his old friend, Owen's out on his ass faster than you can say 'sexual harassment lawsuit.'""

""Jamie, that's—""

""Brilliant? I know."" He's practically vibrating with excitement. ""Plus, you get to lose your virginity to someone who actually knows what he's doing. Win-win.""

My mind races through the possibilities. Owen, professional mask finally cracking. Owen, looking at me like I'm not just a job. Owen, touching me without the pretense of checking for injuries.

""I can't just seduce him. He's too controlled, too professional.""

""Honey, have you seen the way he looks at you? Like he's trying to memorize every detail while simultaneously fighting the urge to throw you over his shoulder and carry you off to his cave.""

""He does not look at me like that.""

""He absolutely does. Especially when you're not paying attention. It's like watching a man slowly lose his mind.""

I steal another glance at Owen. He's turned a page, but his jaw is tight, and there's something about his posture that suggests internal conflict.

""Even if that's true,"" I say, ""he'd never cross that line. He's too old for that shit.""

""Everyone has a breaking point, Noelle. Even Mr. Perfect over there."" Jamie's smile is pure evil. ""You just need to find his.""

""And how exactly do I do that?""

""By being yourself. But more. More gorgeous, more tempting, more impossible to resist.""

He pauses then for more dramatic effect, eyes sparkling with mischief.

""Think about it. You've been dying to lose your virginity to someone who won't fumble around like a teenager. Owen looks like he could show you things that would make you forget your own name.""

Heat pools low in my belly at the thought.

Owen's hands on my skin, his mouth on mine, those careful, controlled movements becoming something desperate and wild.

""This is crazy,"" I whisper.

""The best plans always are.""

""What if it doesn't work? What if he's not interested?""

""Then you'll have tried. And you'll still be stuck with him, but at least you'll know."" Jamie reaches across the table and squeezes my hand. ""But trust me, babe. He's interested.

""Sloppy form on that dismount, Reyes!"" Coach Foster's voice cut across the gym like a whip crack.

He stormed toward me, clipboard clutched in his white-knuckled grip.

""And those landings—are you gaining weight again? It's getting obvious!""

Around us, the other gymnasts froze mid-routine, their eyes darting between George and me like spectators at a gladiator match.

Sarah stopped her floor routine entirely. Maya's hands slipped on the beam.

""I hit my marks,"" I said, my voice steady despite the fire burning in my chest.

""Don't you dare argue with me!"" George stepped closer, invading my space until I could smell his stale coffee breath. ""Your body fat percentage is up. Your form is deteriorating. And if you think attitude is going to get you to the Olympics—""

""My weight is exactly what it was last month.""

The gym went dead silent. Even the sound system seemed to pause between songs. George's face flushed red, his jaw working like he was chewing nails.

""Extra conditioning. Tonight. And tomorrow morning at five AM."" He scribbled furiously on his clipboard. ""Maybe hunger will teach you respect.""

I stayed still, heart pounding from more than just exertion.

In gymnastics, perfection isn't a goal, it's a demand, and the price is your body, your mind, and everything in between.

I learned early enough that pain gets praised and silence keeps you safe. But even silence can't shield you when everything starts to shift.

The gym doors creaked open, and Maria Holloway, the center director, stepped inside.

Clipboard in hand. Tight jaw. I could tell something was off before she said a word.

“George. Sienna.” Her heels clicked across the floor. “We have an update. Ford Callen is joining our coaching staff.”

The name hit harder than George’s insults. I glanced at him, and the reaction came fast, pure disdain.

“Callen?” His voice climbed. “That washed-up has-been? Couldn’t handle being second best, so now you're bringing that reform zealot into my program?”

""Our program,"" Maria corrected sharply. ""And he starts today.""

""Over my dead body!"" George's face went purple. ""That man is poison! He destroys everything he touches with his soft-approach nonsense. My girls are champions because I make them champions!""

""Your girls are breaking down,"" Maria shot back, her composure cracking. ""Injury rates are through the roof. Three girls quit last month alone.""

""Weak links!"" George slammed his hand against the nearest apparatus. ""I don't coddle quitters!""

I stayed quiet, processing. I’d heard of Callen, of course. Everyone had. Olympic prodigy turned coach with a reputation for... well, *a lot*.

He was either ahead of his time or a walking controversy, depending on who you asked. George hated him, clearly. That alone made me curious.

""I..."" I started, but the gym doors opened again.

Ford Callen walked in like he owned the place.

Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed entirely in black athletic wear that made him look like death incarnate. His dark hair was tousled, a thin scar cutting through his right eyebrow like a battle wound.

But it was his eyes that commanded attention—sharp, observing, missing nothing as they swept the room.

He didn't announce himself. Didn't smile or offer pleasantries. He simply stood there, taking inventory of the chaos he'd walked into.

""Callen."" George's voice dripped with venom.

""Foster."" Ford's response was flat, emotionless.

The tension between them was electric, crackling across the space like live wires. Every gymnast in the room felt it.

We'd all heard the stories—former training partners, rival coaches, bad blood that went back years.

Something about the way he looked at me, not lascivious, not cruel, but clinical, and it made my pulse jump. And then I hated myself for noticing how attractive he was.

He looked like trouble.

The kind that didn’t yell but dismantled you with silence. I broke eye contact, jaw tight, and resumed stretching like it hadn’t happened.

""Sienna Reyes,"" he said, my name carrying weight in his deep voice.

""That's my athlete,"" George snarled, stepping protectively—or possessively—in front of me.

“Sienna, I know this is sudden,” Maria started. “Ford Callen has a different approach, but he’s been brought in for a reason. He’s highly respected.”

“I already have a coach,” I said, keeping my voice even. “Coach Foster’s methods work.”

Her eyes softened. “I’m not asking you to switch loyalties. Just… be open. We all want you at the Olympics. Callen’s here to help.”

I nodded once. No promises made.

That evening, I stayed late for my second round of conditioning. It wasn’t mandatory, but I’d built a routine that didn’t allow rest. The gym was quieter than usual, lit by half the overheads.

My arms ached, legs heavy, but I worked through it. Floor passes, rope climbs, core sets until the burn dulled into background noise. My phone buzzed mid-cooldown.

*\&gt; Coach Foster***:** *Callen watched your floor today. Claims your landings are unstable. Wants access to your training logs. I told him exactly where he could shove his opinions. Don't speak to him. Don't listen to him. Extra conditioning tomorrow, 5 AM sharp. We'll show him what real commitment looks like.*

I stared at the message, thumb hovering over the screen. My body screamed for rest, but I typed the only reply George expected.

*\&gt; Me:* *I’ll be ready.*

But as I packed up my gear, movement caught my eye. A figure in black sat motionless in the bleachers, arms crossed, watching. Ford Callen. Waiting.

This time, I didn't look away. Didn't pretend he wasn't there. We stared at each other across the empty gym, two predators sizing each other up.

""Rough day?"" he called out, his voice echoing in the silence.

""I've had worse.""

He stood slowly, deliberately, and walked down from the bleachers. Each step seemed calculated, purposeful. When he reached the floor, he stopped just close enough to make his presence felt.

""George thinks he owns you,"" he said simply.

""Nobody owns me.""

""Good."" His eyes held mine steadily. ""Because tomorrow, we're going to find out what you're really capable of.""",1,1754289487.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of pinecone candles depend on a variety of features related to their materials, construction, and scent.**Wax Type:** The type of wax used in a pinecone candle considerably impacts its burning time, scent throw, and environmental impact. Paraffin wax, while common, is derived from petroleum and can release soot. Soy wax,made from soybeans,is a more sustainable and cleaner-burning alternative. Beeswax is another natural option, known for its long burn time and subtle honey scent.

The composition of the wax determines how cleanly the candle burns and how effectively it disperses its fragrance. A higher-quality wax blend frequently enough results in a more even melt pool and a more consistent scent experience throughout the candle's lifespan. Many manufacturers are now opting for soy-based or beeswax blends to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.

**Scent Profile:** The scent of a pinecone candle is crucial to its overall appeal. Common scent profiles include pine, cedarwood, cinnamon, vanilla, and other woodsy or autumnal aromas. The use of essential oils versus synthetic fragrances also plays a role. Essential oils provide a more natural and subtle scent, while synthetic fragrances can offer a wider range of bolder aromas.

The strength and complexity of the scent are also vital considerations. Some candles offer a delicate and understated fragrance,while others provide a more robust and immersive scent experience. Individual preferences vary widely, so it's critically important to consider the desired ambiance and the size of the space when selecting a scent profile.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The visual appearance of a pinecone candle is just as critically important as its scent. Candles can be designed to mimic the appearance of a pinecone through intricate molding or by incorporating actual dried pinecones. The size, shape, and coloration of the candle all contribute to its overall aesthetic appeal.

Some candles feature elaborate details, such as hand-painted accents or glitter embellishments, while others embrace a more minimalist and natural design. The choice of design often depends on the individual's personal style and the intended décor.

**Burn Time:** The burn time of a pinecone candle is a key factor in its value. Longer burn times mean that the candle will provide more hours of enjoyment before needing to be replaced. burn time is influenced by the type of wax,the size of the candle,and the number of wicks.

Manufacturers typically provide an estimated burn time for their candles, but actual burn time can vary depending on environmental conditions and usage habits. It's critically important to consider burn time in relation to the candle's price to determine its overall cost-effectiveness.Key features of the best pinecone candles include:

*   high-quality wax (soy or beeswax blend).
*   Natural and appealing scent profiles.
*   Intricate and realistic pinecone designs.
*   Long and consistent burn times.

1mh64yg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh64yg,What did Lenin die of?,"At the time of his death, Lenin was only 53 years old. He never complained much about his health. What killed this energetic and young man?

The debate about the causes of Vladimir Ulyanov's illness and death continues to this day: many facts related to his death are classified. A real sensation in 2017 was the discovery of Lenin's doctors' diary in the archives. From these entries, one can understand what he was actually being treated for. But after the discovery became known, access to the document was closed again.

Vladimir Ulyanov died on January 21, 1924 in Gorki near Moscow. According to the official conclusion, ""the basis of the deceased's illness is widespread atherosclerosis of the vessels due to their premature wear,"" and the cause of death was circulatory disorders and a cerebral hemorrhage. It was believed that the disease was provoked by excessive stress, as well as the consequences of an assassination attempt on him in 1918.

Despite official statements, many rumors about the causes of Lenin's death began to spread in Russia and abroad, the most persistent of which was about the syphilitic nature of his illness. Concerned about this, the People's Commissar of Health Nikolai Semashko even gave a special order to write that no signs of ""syphilitic lesion"" were found during the autopsy of Lenin's body.

But the rumors did not arise out of nowhere - the symptoms of ""arteriosclerosis"" (as atherosclerosis was called at the time), which the patient Ulyanov suffered from, were too atypical.

The first signs of the disease became noticeable in mid-1921: Lenin began to feel dizzy, faint, and suffered from insomnia and headaches. The illness was explained by ordinary fatigue. But the disease was advancing: fainting became more frequent, attacks began in the form of sudden paralysis, loss of speech, and memory. Colleagues and relatives noted that Vladimir Ilyich's character had also changed: he became capricious, often falling into a rage. ""The old man was... in a state of great irritation... especially irritated by the appearance of N.K. [Krupskaya],"" wrote party member Yevgeny Preobrazhensky in a letter to Nikolai Bukharin after a visit to Gorki in July 1923.

At the very beginning of 1924, Vladimir Ulyanov seemed to be getting better. The last day of his life, January 21, began as usual: Ilyich drank broth and coffee, slept a lot. “But soon his chest began to bubble… a spasm ran through his body, I first held his hot, wet hand, then I just watched as the handkerchief was stained with blood” - this is how Nadezhda Krupskaya described her husband’s death. The conclusion on the causes of Ulyanov’s death was drawn up on January 22, 1924 and signed by ten doctors.

The death of the leader began to be surrounded by rumors the day after January 21, 1924. The most popular versions were recorded in the reports of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission:

● Lenin died six months ago and was frozen all this time;

● Lenin died a long time ago, but the Bolsheviks made a wax doll of him, which they showed to the people;

● Lenin was poisoned by Trotsky (Stalin);

● Lenin is alive and went abroad.

Ninety-three years later, in 2017, geriatrician Valery Novoselov, while studying the aging of the brain, discovered in the former Central Party Archives of the CPSU Central Committee (now RGASPI) the ""Diary of the medical history of V. I. Lenin from May 28, 1922 - January 21, 1924"". The ""Diary"" contains notes by the doctors on duty who treated the leader: a description of symptoms, prescribed medications, procedures, etc. Novoselov became the first (judging by the archive records) to be issued the document since it was placed in the archive. From the ""Diary"" Novoselov learned that Ulyanov's patient was treated with drugs based on arsenic, mercury, iodine and bismuth, which are used in the treatment of lues (syphilis). Ulyanov also underwent RW analysis (diagnosis of syphilis) many times, but the results of the first two tests are omitted from the ""Diary"". According to Novoselov, the information obtained from the ""Diary"" allows us to make an unambiguous conclusion that Ulyanov had neurolues.

""No doctor could forget to indicate the RW results, unless there was a special order to do so... Ulyanov's attending physicians diagnosed him with luetic brain damage, treated only this disease, and there was no other treatment,"" Novoselov states in an article published in a collection of the Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

According to the physician, there is nothing surprising or shameful in the fact that Lenin had a tertiary form of syphilis - neurolues. At the beginning of the 20th century, more than 43% of the population in certain areas of Russia suffered from syphilis. Infection often occurred through everyday contact - through shared towels and dishes.

Novoselov applied to the archive for permission to copy the ""Diary"", but was refused. Moreover, access to the document was completely closed, although by law the 75-year secrecy period expired in 1999. It turned out that the “secrecy” was extended for another 25 years – at the request of Lenin’s niece Olga Ulyanova (who died in 2011).

Doctor Novoselov filed a lawsuit demanding that the extension of the restriction on access to the diaries of Lenin's doctors be declared illegal and that the documents be declassified. In March 2018, the Zamoskvoretsky District Court of the capital rejected the lawsuit.

The publication of the doctors' diary could put an end to the nearly century-long disputes about the causes of the illness and death of the leader of the October Revolution. But for now, this is prohibited.

\-------  
  
  
The year I finished high school, on Mom's birthday, Dad brought home a mother-daughter pair and a red rose.  
  
  
Mom took the red rose the little girl handed her and quietly spent her 39th birthday. That night, she slit her wrists.  
  
  
So on my wedding day, I told my husband Blake Ashford, ""If you want a divorce, just give me red roses.""  
  
  
He held me close and said, ""Don't worry, babe. There won't be any flowers in our house. Ever.""  
  
  
Five years later, during a company bidding process, he kicked out the partners and blacklisted them completely—just because someone on their team wore a red rose on her chest.  
  
  
That day, I realized marriage could actually be beautiful.  
  
  
Until six months later, I finished my new drug research and walked out of the lab.  
  
  
The entire hallway was covered in roses.  
  
  
And there was Blake, standing in the middle of it.  
  
  
Right next to him? The same woman he'd kicked out of his company, smiling like the cat who got the cream.  
  
  
My face turned ice-cold, but the man just shrugged like it was no big deal.  
  
  
""Lila put all this together for you. She's your sister. She came here to patch things up between you two.""  
  
  
I stared at Blake for two seconds flat, then turned and walked out.  
  
  
I don't have a sister.  
  
  
And as of right now, I don't need a husband either.  
  
  
...  
  
  
I sat alone at Mom's grave for three hours. Today was her birthday and the tenth anniversary of her death.  
  
  
Red roses used to mean love for my parents.  
  
  
But ten years ago today, Dad just stood there while his mistress's daughter Lila Morrison handed Mom that rose, breaking her completely.  
  
  
Red roses became my worst nightmare.  
  
  
And ten years later, my husband brought the woman who destroyed my mother right back to me, with all those damn flowers. Talk about a knife to the heart.  
  
  
Fireworks lit up the sky in the distance—Blake's party celebrating my drug research. Six months of hell, 180 days of no sleep, all my work. Now it felt like Lila's victory dance.  
  
  
I said goodbye to Mom and stood up when Blake called.  
  
  
He was drunk: ""Party's almost over and you're MIA? What kind of research director are you?""  
  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
  
Any other night, I would've been all playful and sweet with him. But tonight I had nothing to say.  
  
  
Blake's voice got louder: ""Ember, I'm talking to you! Where the hell did you disappear to?""  
  
  
""The cemetery.""  
  
  
Blake went silent. Like he suddenly remembered today was my mom's anniversary. Like he suddenly remembered that for my research, I'd skipped my own birthday, canceled our anniversary dinner. The one thing I asked for was for him to come with me to visit Mom.  
  
  
Two seconds of dead silence before Blake finally spoke: ""I... I was so excited about today, I forgot.""  
  
  
""Wait for me.""  
  
  
I hung up, then turned and left straight away.  
  
  
But when I reached the parking lot, Blake's texts came through:  
  
  
\[Ember, it's too late tonight. Next time, okay?\]  
  
  
\[Lila's wasted. I need to get her home first.\]  
  
  
\[Don't worry, I'll make it up to you.\]  
  
  
I wasn't surprised at all.  
  
  
With Lila's games, of course she'd find a way to keep Blake busy tonight. I could see right through her act. Blake, who'd survived years in cutthroat business, could definitely see it too.  
  
  
But Blake didn't care. He was enjoying every second of it. He didn't give a damn about my feelings.  
  
  
That's fine though. From now on, I don't have to care about his either.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Blake didn't come home that night. No texts, no calls, nothing.  
  
  
I didn't care. Didn't even ask.  
  
  
Next morning, I got to the office early. Blake was the CEO, I ran R&D. In five years, we'd built this company from a garage startup to a downtown powerhouse.  
  
  
But our relationship? Went the opposite direction.  
  
  
Phase one of the new drug was done, so things were pretty quiet for now.  
  
  
I was sipping my coffee, reading through the divorce papers my lawyer sent, when Blake walked into my office.  
  
  
I was drinking my coffee and going through the divorce papers my lawyer sent when Blake strolled into my office.  
  
  
""Lila twisted her ankle getting out of the car last night, so I had to take care of her.  
  
  
It got really late, so I just grabbed a hotel room.""  
  
  
I nodded and kept reading my divorce papers, answering without looking up: ""Okay, got it.""  
  
  
Made sense. We were about to get divorced anyway.  
  
  
Who he slept with and where was his business, not mine. No need to keep me in the loop.  
  
  
Blake froze, like he wanted to say something but held back:  
  
  
""Let's grab dinner tonight. You're the star of this whole drug project—we should celebrate properly.""  
  
  
He paused, glanced at me, then added: ""Maybe we should invite Lila too. I think you two need to talk. She was just a kid when your mom died, you know.""  
  
  
Hearing Blake defend Lila made my hand stop mid-page.  
  
  
I wanted to ask him—wasn't I just a kid too when my mom killed herself?  
  
  
I pushed down my anger, took a sip of coffee, and said quietly: ""Mind your own business. Tonight, just us two.""  
  
  
We needed to talk about the divorce anyway. Didn't need an audience.  
  
  
Sister? My mom only had one daughter. Me.  
  
  
Blake looked at me like I was being jealous.  
  
  
He was about to smirk and say something when his phone rang.  
  
  
The second he saw ""Lila"" pop up, his face lit up. He grabbed his phone and bolted out of my office.  
  
  
Near closing time, Blake sent me a restaurant reservation.  
  
  
Some fancy private place. His idea of making it up to me.  
  
  
I stuffed the divorce papers in my bag and headed out.  
  
  
Blake's car pulled up as I left the building. He rolled down the window: ""Go home and get ready. Quick client meeting, then I'll meet you there.""  
  
  
He drove off before I could even answer.  
  
  
I used to spend two hours getting ready for dates with Blake. Always stressed about makeup and outfits, but somehow loved every minute of it.  
  
  
Not tonight though. No point.  
  
  
Instead, I hit up a massage place nearby. Let my body unwind after all those late nights and overtime. Felt amazing.  
  
  
When I got to the restaurant, Blake wasn't there yet. I texted him—no response.  
  
  
I shrugged and didn't wait around like usual. Just ordered.  
  
  
The place was actually really nice. Great atmosphere, incredible food. Way better than wolfing down takeout at the office.  
  
  
So when Blake never showed up, I wasn't even mad.  
  
  
The guy threw away seven years with me. Why would I care about one more no-show?  
  
  
Truth is, he had no clue. The biggest gift he could give me was signing those divorce papers.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
After dinner, I walked home slowly. All those sleepless nights at work had cut me off from the world. The street life around me felt refreshing.  
  
  
I stopped when I reached a familiar corner.  
  
  
The garage where Blake and I started our company was gone—completely demolished.  
  
  
That little dumpling shop where we'd eat every day to save a buck? Now it was some fancy bakery.  
  
  
Everything changes. Even the memories I used to treasure had faded with time.  
  
  
My phone rang. It was my old professor.  
  
  
There was hesitation in his voice: ""Ember, your application for the classified 707 project got approved yesterday.""  
  
  
""But I need to ask one more time—are you absolutely sure about this?""  
  
  
""It's a five-year commitment minimum. Without you, your husband's company will tank.""  
  
  
""Will he be okay with this?""  
  
  
I stepped forward, leaving that familiar street behind, my voice steady: ""Professor, I'm getting divorced.""  
  
  
...  
  
  
Since the classified project was starting soon and I wanted out fast, I told him to send someone tomorrow.  
  
  
I wasn't in the mood to wander around anymore, so I just grabbed a cab home.  
  
  
The living room lights were on. Blake was on the couch, texting someone.  
  
  
The second he saw me, his frown disappeared.  
  
  
He rushed over, grabbed my hand, and demanded: ""Why didn't you wait for me at the restaurant? I showed up and you were gone—do you know how embarrassing that was?!""  
  
  
I stared at him, surprised he'd actually gone.  
  
  
But seeing him act all righteous and offended? I almost laughed.  
  
  
Made sense though. He was used to me waiting around for him.  
  
  
I pulled my hand away from Blake's grip. ""I was done eating. Why would I stick around?""  
  
  
Maybe realizing he was actually in the wrong, he swallowed his irritation and handed me a gift box.  
  
  
""Got this specially for you today. Go ahead, open it.""  
  
  
Not surprising. After standing me up twice, he had to throw me a bone.  
  
  
That was Blake's thing—mess up, then toss me some small gesture afterward.  
  
  
And I used to sit there anxiously hoping for more, maybe just a little extra time together.  
  
  
I took the box and tossed it on the couch.  
  
  
""How thoughtful.""  
  
  
My tone was flat and polite.  
  
  
His smile froze. First time he'd actually noticed I was going through the motions.  
  
  
Panic flickered in his eyes as he reached for my hand again.  
  
  
That's when Lila's voice drifted down from upstairs:  
  
  
""Blake, maybe I should just go home. I don't want Ember getting the wrong idea when she comes back.""  
  
  
She appeared at the top of the stairs, and when she saw me, the smugness in her eyes vanished. She covered her mouth, putting on this whole shocked act.  
  
  
Blake rushed to explain: ""Lila hurt her ankle yesterday, so I took her for a follow-up today. That's why I was late.""  
  
  
""She can barely walk right now, so I told her to crash in the guest room tonight.""  
  
  
He stared at me intensely, like he was bracing for me to blow up.  
  
  
I nodded, completely unbothered: ""Fine. I'll grab a hotel room then. I'm not staying under the same roof as her.""  
  
  
Blake just stood there, stunned. This wasn't the reaction he was expecting.  
  
  
""If you really don't want Lila staying here, I can take her—""  
  
  
Before he could finish, Lila tumbled down the stairs and started sobbing, clutching her foot.  
  
  
Blake freaked out and rushed to carry her back upstairs, massaging her ankle.  
  
  
When I came back downstairs with my suitcase, Blake appeared in the living room again.  
  
  
His lips were pressed tight as he grabbed my hand, refusing to let go. The guilt in his eyes kept growing deeper.  
  
  
Finally, with Lila calling for him upstairs, he said: ""Tomorrow. I'll go with you to see your mom. We'll talk everything out in front of her.""  
  
  
I stared at him blankly and walked out.  
  
  
Talk? He could talk to my lawyer.  
  
  
The second Lila showed up in our house, I was done discussing anything with him—even the divorce.

1mh620x,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mh620x/nobody_believes_me/,Nobody believes me,"This is my first ever reddit post so forgive me if I am not good at this.I will be honest, I came here because I wish for some sort of confirmation. For someone to hint that they believe me. 
I will give to you the brief over view of my life and an explanation as to how I am now in my current postion, unemployed and out of education for the past year.

As a child I was quiet.Too quiet, almost mute.There were 3 things people used to say "" she is so good at art"" ""she is too sensitive"" and ""she day dreams a lot"". My parents repeated these sentiment and told me to toughen up.I remember dissociating in classrooms and teachers getting quickly frustrated when I so easily managed to grasp one thing and not another. I particularly remember 30 minutes holding back tears as one explained how commas was used. My brain would not focus on what she was saying. Like it was fuzzy and whilst I could hear her just fine, my brain could not process what she had said. I was labelled as weird by other children. Told me there was nothing good about me. I was incapable of answering registers out of shyness but so desperate to fit in. I could not read the social ques so many understood. On the rare occassions I grew the courage to ask a question because I was told ""there are no bad questions"" I was met with yelling and weird looks. I had taken the statement literally as I had to learn not to do. I had asked how long was left till break. It made sense in my head, a respectfully asked question as I had something I felt I must urgently  do but from that moment I was labelled as rude and selfish.
I remember a school trip. The fire drill protocol they woke up all the kids for but me. They had forgotten me and left me inside and the pang I felt from that lasted months if not years. I tried my best to please everyone and got bullied in the end for being kind. I was an overachiever despite my disorganised backpacks and last minute homeworks. It worked out for those years but that is because it was primary school.

Then there were my teenage years. The intense burn outs began. A certain virus had stopped me from taking my GCSE. I can say with certainty I would not have passed.I imagine this is where I started socially adapting. I finally had friends. I learned to at least sort of hold my tongue and stumble on my words less. With new found independency though I had started losing track of normalcy. I could not form habits.It took so much  energy to just think about brushing my teeth or showering, so how am i going to actually brush my teeth or shower? All the planners, calenders, and random papers I would impulsively buy would get filled with repeated to do lists that I would forget to look at in the end. Any subject requiring memorisation would make me end up in tears. My sleep schedule would get progressively worse until it was unfixable. I did nothing but revise. I no longer had hobbies. I was in constant work mode and yet I was getting nowehere. Why? I was doing what everyone  else was doing. I tried so hard. Why does it feel like theres never enough time?
I starting trying coffee. Energy drinks. Anything. But they just would not work. I would lose my bag, my stationary, my keys, my phone and soon my dad shouting at me for such things became the norm.

Next thing I know I am in sixth form. Almost an absolute blur. I remember the stress of it all. The constant burn out and self hatred. The feeling of not doing enough and not being enough. I remember in particular the conversation I had with my physics teacher, telling me that after 2 years of sitting in after school sessions and try so hard, that he could not raise my predicted grade from a C. He had this look on his face like he knew what I was feeling but I don't  thing anybody did. I was mentally not well and it was not just because of the studying. I was always somewhat angry even if it didn't  show. It would slowly build up, explode in the silence of my room and last for weeks or months.  I had started going home early sometimes, hoping I would be able to dissociate so that i didn't  feel so ""here"" despite never feeling truly here.it felt like I was failing at everything. It doesn't  make sense but it does.All nighters were a norm for me. I look back at videos now of myself seeing how upset I was and thought ""how did nobody see it, it was so obvious? Did none of you care?"" And then I feel guilty for being so selfish. I blanked out on two of my exams, forgot to hand in my phone on another and hoped nobody would notice.
I had an art trip to London. My closest friends were there. I was going to my favourite museum and yet I thought.""What a waste"".It felt like I had never left the confines of my room. How could I be in one of my favourite places and be so miserable? I snapped at a friend. Just barely. I knew by now that my emtions were to much so I had learned to hide them. I was never angry at her, it wasn't  even anything she did. I was overwhelmed.  Extremely sad and I felt this need to be alone and at home. This feeling lasted years. Honestly i don't  thinks it's  ever truly gone away and neither has my guilt for everything I have done because of it.

We are at university now. The thing that really lead me here. I was an architecture student. Good at what I did if not for the sake of time and perfectionism. I was confused as to how everyone just got on with it, got started.  How do you move on from one section without it being perfect? How can you possibly be keeping up without having sleepless nights like I do? Why am i barely passing, I am trying so hard?? Why does nobody feel the need to ask for help with everything like I do? Don't they need clear instructions? Why can I help so well on assignments that arent my own? University was not fun. I did not attend those social events. The friendships I thought I had built suddenly switched on me. They realised I was weird, I don't  know when. My daydreaming was mistaken  for dirty looks and my silence as arrogance.I was getting ignored,I encountered a crowd of people listening to the peer on my assignment talking behind my back. I had spoken up as i was passing without thinking. I have thought about that for the past year. How all of those people sat and listened and nobody defended me when I was so generous to them? It took a while for me to realise they were not laughing with me but at me. 

By the end of my second year I had not slept for almost a week. I had an assignment worth 60%. I had forgotten to eat or drink. I felt sick and eventually I had given up on a deadline for the very first time. The feeling of failure was crippling and my mother, as much as I love her, was as over bearing as ever. I wanted to be left alone to think. Thinking is all I do, let me think please. I have finally been able to make a big decision, don't  make me change it. I am ashamed to say I had reached breaking point. Asked to be left alone for the 5th time in an aggressive tone and crawled at the feeling of her touch. What followed in the next few months wasn't  any easier. I was given another month to submit. I barely passed. I worked that hard, was given an extra MONTH and barley passed. My mother was convinced I did not need my gap year off. That it was stress and nothing more and that it would do me no good. I had felt- I FEEL like I have been at war with my brain for years. 

I am reaching the end of my gap year. I got refferred by my GP after booking an appointment out of urgency for my 3rd year approaching. The more I read, the more I realised the way I operate  is not normal.
My family is making fun of me. My ex asked me why I am self diagnosing as if he himself did not point out the things I was doing that he found odd. To preface, I never did, and I am not now. I said I suspected ADHD.
My brother says that everyone thinks they have adhd now and it is too easy to get diagnosed.

I have been trying to hide how badly I have been doing for so long and now when I am trying to get help, nobody believes me because of that. I don't  particularly enjoy being shouted at on a weekly basis for things that are seen as ""routine"" but i have been forgetting for years. I don't  like almost crying behind the driving wheel because I am overwhelmed. I dont find much happiness in forgetting to feed my cat despite setting multiple alarms.

The impulsive spending, the hoarding, the suddenly intense mood swings and forgetfulness. Is there anything else this could be?

The starting hundreds of shows and books and never finishing them. The starting projects and never finishing them. The jumbling of words because I think faster than I speak. The horrible message response times. The loss of interest in hobbies that I have collected so many of. The object impremannece. The attatchment to love interests, they become my only motivator.But then my sudden loss of interest in love interests? The lack of missing people. The horrific sleep schedule. The constant want for changes in style. The need to interject my interesting facts into any conversation. The intense feeling of rejection at the slightest comment. The lack of happiness over anything at all. Being labelled as selfish for wanting my view to be understood? The hate for physical contact? I cant hug my own mother. She says I will regret it when she dies. She says I am cold and unfeeling. Is that not what happens when you tell somebody to stop being emotional?
I have a sister, 12 years old,I don't  get to be not okay because she has become the only one who is allowed to not be okay. I'm so tired.
I want to be believed.
Is this what I get for being so quiet about it for so long?
Ive been dreading going back to university. I can't  do it. I've  been dreading it from the minute it ended.

I am sorry if this is a lot but I had the need to vent and get insight. Sorry if I come accross pessimistic here and if I broke any rules, I am new to this.

Its 7:50am and I have not slept if that accounts for anything.
If anyone is reading, thankyou.

Reason is simple, we see the opportunity of LLM like chatgpt bings to people with zero trading knowledeg like us. So, we planned to build a LLM driven agent who can automatically generate strategy, do backtesting, and iteratively optimize the strategy until reach a satisfied result. With many late night coffees, I finally shipped a strategy development system which has three modules: strategy optimization module, backtesting module, and deployment module. Its most recently generated strategy have a backtesting performacne of 20% average annual return with 13% max drawdown in the period of 2018-2024 trading a single aluminum futures only (I know this is not a result worth showing off, but considering the noobie agent only made money of a few hundred bucks a few month ago, I am still inspired with it).

However, this is still far away from our initial objective building a fully automatic agent, like Tony Stark's Jarvis. Although we are still on the way, Here I want to share a few lessons I have learned so far in case any of you might be intertested with:

1, first of all, the LLM agent (I used Gemini 2.5 pro and grok 4) demenstrated itself having the capability to initiate and optimize trading strategy. The backtest module has verifies the incremental performance enhancement of the strategy output from the strategy. But this is built on the preconditions:

a) input prompt must be accurate. It follows the garbage-in-garbage-out rule. If inaccurate analytic data is feeded to the model, it will output misled results.

b) well-designed prompts and agentic workflow. A single reponse to a single optimization request promt from a single agent is not enough. But a well organizaed unit of agents can deliver in-depth insights indeed by digesting correct and powerful quantitive analytic data.

2, vibe coding like cursor or claude code can significantly increase the working effiency to quickly code and validate the strategy. but that doesn't mean it can do everything for you. Massive handcrafting is still needed. Many times I found vide coding is challenging to precisely follow instruction and convert natural language description of strategy to code. It may diverge from . Sometimes it is just lazy, using placeholder values or functions instead of coding the real strategy initial strategy design. In short, quantitive trading and data analysis is still a overwelming task for autonomous coding agent.

I just deployed the agent-derived strategy to the trading market last Friday. So it is still too early to evaluate its performance. Alghough with above the issues, I still find it as a competent copilot helping people with zero trading knowledge like me get started and ship a strategy to trading market quickly.",0,1754288807.0,quantfinance,1,0.33,False

## Key Features Analysis

The market for metal table legs is diverse, with options ranging from simple hairpin legs to complex geometric designs. The key features to consider include the material, construction, weight capacity, style, adjustability, and finish.

**Material:** The most common materials for metal table legs are steel and iron. Steel is known for its strength,durability,and resistance to corrosion,making it a suitable choice for heavy-duty applications. Iron offers a more rustic and traditional look but may require more maintenance to prevent rust. Additionally, the gauge or thickness of the metal impacts its load-bearing capacity.

**Construction:** Welded construction provides greater strength and stability compared to bolted or screwed connections. Look for legs with clean, strong welds that are free of defects. The quality of the welding significantly impacts the overall structural integrity of the table legs. Furthermore, details like the presence of a mounting plate and its thickness are crucial for secure attachment to the tabletop.

**weight Capacity:** Weight capacity is a critical factor, especially for larger or heavier tabletops. Manufacturers typically specify the maximum weight each set of legs can support. It's essential to choose legs with a weight capacity that exceeds the anticipated load to ensure stability and prevent sagging or collapse. Always consider the distribution of weight when assessing weight capacity.

**Style:** Metal table legs come in a variety of styles to complement different design aesthetics. Hairpin legs offer a minimalist, mid-century modern look, while industrial-style legs feature exposed welds and a raw metal finish.Tapered legs provide a more refined and elegant appearance. The choice of style depends on the overall design intent and the desired aesthetic of the table.**Adjustability:** Adjustable table legs allow you to fine-tune the height of your table, which is notably useful for uneven floors or creating ergonomic workstations. These legs typically feature leveling feet or adjustable extensions that can be easily adjusted to achieve the desired height. Some adjustable legs are designed to switch between coffee table and dining table heights.

**Finish:** The finish of metal table legs not only affects their appearance but also their durability and resistance to corrosion. Powder coating provides a durable, scratch-resistant finish that is available in a wide range of colors. Chrome and brushed metal finishes offer a sleek, modern look, while painted finishes provide a more traditional aesthetic. The choice of finish should complement the overall design and consider the intended use of the table.

## Core Benefits

Investing in high-quality metal table legs offers several core benefits that directly impact the functionality, aesthetics, and longevity of your furniture.

**Enhanced Stability:** Metal table legs provide superior stability compared to wooden or plastic alternatives. The inherent strength and rigidity of metal ensure that your table remains wobble-free,even under heavy loads. This is particularly significant for dining tables, desks, and other surfaces that require a stable and reliable foundation. Properly installed metal legs will improve the product lifespan.

**Increased Durability:** Metal is a highly durable material that can withstand years of use and abuse. metal table legs are resistant to scratches, dents, and other forms of damage that can plague wooden or plastic legs.This durability makes them a long-lasting investment that will continue to look great for years to come. This is especially useful in high traffic environments.

**Versatile Design Options:** Metal table legs are available in a wide range of styles, finishes, and sizes, making them a versatile choice for a variety of design applications. Whether you're creating a minimalist modern desk or a rustic farmhouse dining table, there are metal table legs to complement your design aesthetic. Custom designs are also easily fabricated from steel.**Easy Installation:** Most metal table legs are designed for easy installation, requiring only basic tools and minimal effort. Many legs come with pre-drilled holes and mounting hardware,making the installation process straightforward. This ease of installation allows you to quickly and easily upgrade your existing furniture or create new pieces from scratch. Installation is a major consideration for DIY projects.

## FAQs Section

**What is the best way to clean metal table legs?**
The best way to clean metal table legs depends on the finish. For powder-coated legs, a damp cloth and mild soap are usually sufficient. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the finish. For chrome or brushed metal finishes, use a specialized metal cleaner to remove fingerprints and smudges. Regularly dusting will also help maintain the appearance and prolong the lifespan of the finish.

**How do I prevent metal table legs from scratching my floors?**
To prevent metal table legs from scratching your floors, consider using protective floor pads or feet. These pads are typically made of felt, rubber, or plastic and attach to the bottom of the legs to create a barrier between the metal and the floor. Regularly check the pads for wear and replace them as needed to maintain optimal protection.Additionally, ensure that the floor is clean and free of debris that could become trapped under the legs and cause scratches.

**Can I use metal table legs outdoors?**
Whether you can use metal table legs outdoors depends on the type of metal and the finish. Steel legs that are not treated for outdoor use will rust over time. Look for legs that are made of stainless steel or have a powder-coated finish designed for outdoor use. These finishes provide a protective barrier against the elements, preventing rust and corrosion. Regularly inspect outdoor legs for any signs of damage and address them promptly to prolong their lifespan.

I’m (M38) planning a 2-month sabbatical for early next year, and I want to combine it with one of my biggest personal goals: finally improving my Spanish through real immersion.

I've been learning Spanish on and off for a few years — mostly self-taught with Dreaming Spanish, Coffee Break Español, some grammar work, and occasional tutoring. I’d say I’m at a solid A2 level, and my aim is to reach B2 by mid or late next year.

Since my company (based in Central Europe) allows sabbaticals between 1 and 3 months, I want to make the most of it — learning the language, experiencing Latin American culture, while avoiding constant moving around.

The plan is to start in late January and travel for 8 weeks. Here's my current itinerary:

1. 5 weeks in Medellín (Colombia)
   * Stay in El Poblado
   * Start with a 3-week intensive Spanish course (group + private classes + cultural activities)
   * Then 2 weeks of self-guided learning and local immersion (fitness, cafés, language meetups etc.)
   * Goal: speak Spanish daily and build a local routine
2. 1 week in Antigua (Guatemala)
   * Explore the town, hike Volcán Pacaya, try ziplining and visit waterfalls
   * Optional: hike Acatenango overnight
   * Maybe take a short Spanish refresher or just practice with locals
3. Final week in Isla Mujeres (Mexico)
   * Relax and enjoy the beach
   * Casual Spanish practice if possible
   * Easy direct flight back to Europe from Cancún

What matters to me:

* Learning Spanish through immersion
* New cultural experiences
* Not rushing from place to place — I prefer staying longer in fewer spots
* A good mix of social time and privacy (will rent my own Airbnb)
* I’m not trying to do it all — just make meaningful progress and enjoy it

Any feedback, tips, or suggestions? Would love to hear your thoughts!

I’m a 26-year-old guy from Germany working in commissioning for custom-built machinery. It’s one of those roles that are hard to explain unless you’ve seen it firsthand, but I enjoy the variety and challenges it brings. Just started my day with a strong cup of coffee and thought it’d be a good time for some relaxed conversation.

I’m always open to meeting new people, no matter where you’re from. Some of my main interests include traveling, technology, music, anime, and gaming. Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time playing CS2. I also have a soft spot for those unexpected stories people share that somehow stick with you or brighten your mood.

If you feel like having a casual chat or just want to share what’s going on in your world, I’m all ears. Let’s trade some positive vibes and see where the conversation takes us.",1,1754288514.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
