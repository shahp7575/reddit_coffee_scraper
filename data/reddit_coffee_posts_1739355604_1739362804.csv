- Why'd you leave when you were earning so well? (Limited opportunities to grow & so on) 
- Tell me top 3 electrical companies in india( i listed havells, schneider, Alstom. Tbh it felt like he wanted to hear some specific name, my guess is BHEL/BEL)
- F2: what field would you like to work in? (Told strategy building in a technical company since my UG blah blah blah) 
- If you were to advertise an EV, how would you go about it keeping Indian audience in mind? ( I answered to the best of my abilities, but she wanted to ear a one-liner text or jingle; couldn't come up with it) 

Overall, a good experience.

**The Liberty Trail after you cross the Man O'War pedway bridge and then head towards Liberty Elementary has a place where an apartment complex has a sidewalk and connects it to the trail.  Nearby this area is a city trash can.  The trash can is usually on**
The trash can is usually on the right side of the trail.  This area of the trail over time has become extremely nasty.  Numerous people from the apartment complex bring their dogs to go to the bathroom in this area of the trail between the sidewalk and the trash can.  The piles of dog feces build up and up over time.  It becomes quite gross.  I was wondering if a MUTT MITT station could be put in this area to try and encourage the residents to pick up after their dogs.  Maybe even signage reminding them to pick up and the problems feces left on the ground and trail cause.  I took pictures of the area where the sidewalk from the apartment complex meets the trail and where the trashcan is located if you need a better visual of the area.  In the fall it was quite covered, and you have to be careful not to let your dog get off the trail here for fear of getting feces on their paws.  It is definitely needing to be addressed before spring and good weather are here once again and the area becomes gross.  Thank you!

The property owner of 952 Gerardi (Michael Schroeder, michaelalanschroeder@gmail.com, 502-797-9683) reached out to LEXserv / LexCall on May 9, 2024, and to his CM and Parks on May 13, 2024, about concerns with trees and limbs in Liberty Park that could fall onto his property and cause damage to his fence or home.  His emails were routed to DES on May 20, 2024 (subject line “Dead trees and limbs”), but without accompanying SRs that would’ve tracked the issue for our follow-up.  Nathan, please coordinate with Mr. Schroeder at your earliest convenience and provide an assessment of the trees that are of concern to him.

On day 14 I have started to wake up every morning with a thumping heart, ruminating and sometimes coming to tears. Has anyone else noticed similar effects to this?

Like the title suggests, I'm looking for good UK roasters who deliver relatively fresh coffee by default, so 7 days or less off roast routinely. 

I understand that the general consensus points towards resting light roasts for three weeks or more, with rest times in the order of several months not being uncommon, but every time I do this I find that the flavour has deteriorated, not improved.

Like salt in cooking, I can always add aging myself, but I can't remove it if it's already been added for me. 

Plenty of good roasters who normally deliver coffee two weeks or more off roast will accommodate a request for fresher coffee, but A. I need to remember to do that each time and B. They need to remember that I've requested this before packing the order. Plus the conversation always feels awkward - like I say, an unpopular request these days. 

Any suggestions? I have Crankhouse, Horsham and Hundred House so far.

They were weird sometimes and boring sometimes. 

I don't remember my dreams that frequently, so maybe I'm dreaming of other places and forgetting?

But for several years now, when I do remember a dream, it took place in one of 5 different settings that are constant. 

There's a library with many floors

there's an old house also with many floors and a spooky basement

there's a coffee shop

there's a weird floating highway that always leads me to a huge airport

and there's a loooong stretch of beach with houses along it. I only ever get to be on the sand or in the water, I've never gotten to the other side of the houses. 

Generally the feeling of the dream decides where it happens, I think. The highway/airport is my stress/anxiety dream location. 

The coffee shop and library are neutral/positive places. 

Does anyone else have this? It doesn't feel normal but it doesn't feel that weird? ",1,1739362441.0,DoesAnybodyElse,0,1.0,False

There is a lot of development happening on skeetclub/Wendover. The city has plans to widen NC-68 over the next 8 years around this location. The apartment complex behind panera is pretty huge. That will add a lot of people and traffic probably.

I can hear the swelp swelp swelp of the broom sweeping the kitchen poorly and the soft hum of the vacuum cleaner in their future.  I even have some steak to cook.  

The kids will complain and demand to do their homework and 7F will try to make a 30 minute paper last 2 hours, but I’m on to her.  

I did something completely for me yesterday.  I drove 30 minutes to a pie shop in a tiny town named Spearman, TX.  A widow friend of mine makes pie and coffee on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I went down and had a slice of pie.  She was just a bit too busy to chat much but I spoke with her friends and it was nice.  I don’t get much time to talk to adults without my kids present.  I hung out for a couple hours and still couldn’t finish the banoffe pie.  Think banana cream with a layer of caramel under it.  I brought back a slice of it and a chocolate cream pie for the kids.  I’ll go back whenever I am able, but it’s a tad out of the way.  She’s been a widow for 10 years and has a 12 yo girl, senior girl and two older boys.  

I am hoping to have her as someone local I can talk to.  She’s been through the wringer and is pushing on.  I admire her positivity.  From the outside she always seemed so in control and confident and strong.  Then she tells me that even years after people would say how are you doing and she would think TERRIBLE.  She was and is lonely.  Yesterday morning she had a flat tire and had to change it herself while trying to get the two kids left in school headed off.  She said she wishes she had that help.  She gets it.  Sometimes you just need someone who gets it.  

Anyway, I didn’t even cry while we spoke but I almost did.  She didn’t either, but she almost did.  You know what?  I got three hugs too.  I don’t think I’ve been hugged by an adult in several months.  Try and go someplace you can talk and be hugged.  It’s pretty damn nice.

Everyone is welcome to share here, but let’s try to keep it positive.  We have plenty of negative in our lives already.

1inp7x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1inp7x4/is_zowie_king_the_best_milk_frothing_pitcher_my/,Is ZOWIE KING the best milk frothing pitcher? My review.,"I’ve been using the ZOWIE KING milk frothing pitcher daily for several months now, and I have to say, this little jug has become an indispensable part of my morning coffee routine. I’m not an expert barista, just someone who really loves a good latte or cappuccino. Still, this stainless steel pitcher makes me feel like I could open my own café. Its sleek design and practical features make it a standout product, but, as with anything, there are a few quirks worth noting.

This pitcher’s size is perfect for one or two cups of frothy goodness. At 12 ounces, it’s small enough for single servings but not too tiny to handle a bit extra. The stainless steel build feels surprisingly sturdy yet lightweight, weighing in at just 5.5 ounces. The material is durable, resistant to rust, and easy to clean—qualities I absolutely need in a kitchen tool that gets daily use. I even tested it with some heavy whipping cream, and it performed like a champ. However, I noticed the 12-ounce capacity can be limiting if you’re trying to whip up a larger batch of milk for guests.

[Check ZOWIE KING price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-milk-frothing-pitcher-zowie-king-review-b07rq54x63/)

One of my favorite features is the precision spout. Pouring with this pitcher is a dream—it’s designed so well that I’ve started dabbling in latte art. The decorating pen included in the package is a fun bonus. My 12-year-old niece even tried her hand at making a heart design, and while it didn’t exactly look like a heart, we had a great time. That said, I wish the measurement markings inside the pitcher were more detailed. While they’re easy to read, having smaller increments—maybe going down to 25ml—would make it more versatile.

Now, let’s talk about heat. While this pitcher doesn’t have an insulated handle, the hand-held design does a decent job of staying cool enough to touch. I didn’t experience any discomfort while using it with my espresso machine’s steaming wand. However, I can see how someone with sensitive hands might wish for a bit more insulation. The narrow mouth also helps control the flow of liquid, making it easier to avoid spills, though you need to pour carefully if you’re frothing milk to the brim.

**Pros**

* High-quality stainless steel build that is durable and rust-resistant.
* Precision spout and narrow mouth make pouring and latte art easier.
* Lightweight and compact, perfect for personal use.
* Includes a decorating pen for added fun.

**Cons**

* Limited capacity might not suit those making drinks for multiple people.
* Measurement markings could be more detailed and available on both sides.
* Handle lacks insulation, which could be a drawback for some users.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to other milk frothing pitchers like those from Breville or Rattleware, the ZOWIE KING pitcher holds its ground surprisingly well. The Breville pitcher, which I’ve also used, feels heavier and comes with a slightly larger capacity, making it better suited for families. However, the ZOWIE KING pitcher excels in its lightweight nature and the inclusion of a decorating pen, which the Breville option lacks.

The Rattleware pitcher, on the other hand, offers a more professional-grade feel, with more precise measurement markings. However, it comes at a higher price point, which might not be worth it for casual coffee lovers. The ZOWIE KING pitcher strikes a nice balance between affordability and functionality, though it would benefit from a few design tweaks to truly compete.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This milk frothing pitcher is reasonably priced for what it offers. While there are cheaper pitchers on the market, they often sacrifice build quality. The ZOWIE KING pitcher feels like it’s built to last. Its rust-resistant stainless steel construction, coupled with its thoughtful design features, makes it a worthwhile investment for any coffee enthusiast. If you’re someone who makes coffee at home daily, this pitcher is a great choice.

In a world of overpriced gadgets and kitchen tools, this product feels like a sweet spot. It’s not the cheapest option, but it delivers on most of its promises, making it a good middle-ground solution for coffee lovers who want something reliable without breaking the bank.

Chapter 1
During an Antarctic expedition, disaster struck. An avalanche hit without warning, and my fiancé, Aaron Moore, didn't even hesitate. He ran straight to Naomi Taylor, his first love, and left me to fend for myself.
On the other hand, Damien Pierce, the expedition leader, saw me teetering on the edge of an icy crevasse and didn't think twice. He risked his life to pull me back from the brink.
Later, on our wedding day, Aaron abandoned me at the altar. No explanation. No warning.
He just ran off with Naomi. And at that moment, Damien, without missing a beat, dropped to one knee and proposed.
We got married, and for a while, things seemed fine. Damien treated me well, as a husband should.
Life seemed normal for the first time in ages.
But, like everything that feels too good to be true, happiness didn't last.
Two years into our marriage, Damien was suddenly diagnosed with liver cancer.
I didn't think twice. I donated two-thirds of my liver to save him—anything to keep him alive.
But as I lay recovering in the hospital, everything changed. I overheard his best friend, Hayden, speaking to him in French.
""If Camille finds out you faked having liver cancer just to save Naomi, aren't you afraid she'll leave you with nothing?""
Damien held my hand, looking at me with those soft, affectionate eyes. But his next words chilled me to the bone.
""The marriage certificate was fake. But I do owe her. I'll make it up to her.""
I had thought I'd finally found someone who cared about me. Someone who wouldn't leave me alone in the world.
But it was all a lie.
A well-played, elaborate lie.
——
I followed Damien to the VIP suite on the top floor of the hospital, thinking he was going to check on me. But in his haste, he forgot to close the door all the way.
As I approached, I caught a glimpse through the small gap. Naomi was in his arms, her face glowing with relief, her smile as radiant as ever.
I looked at myself in the reflection of the glass—pale, fragile, barely hanging on.
Between the two of us, who was really on the edge of death?
""Damien, I knew you wouldn't abandon me!"" Naomi's voice was sweet, relief practically dripping from every word.
Damien gently stroked her hair, his voice soft and tender, a warmth I'd never felt from him before.
""As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.""
...
I spent five months in the hospital after my surgery. Five months of drifting in and out of consciousness, all while Damien came and went. But how many of those visits had been to see Naomi, not me?
I watched him, his eyes filled with a warmth I'd never seen before. So this was how he looked when he was in love.
A memory flashed in my mind. It was not long ago that I had first regained consciousness. Damien was sitting beside me, gripping my hand tightly.
I tried to speak, to call his name, but before I could, I overheard Hayden, Damien's friend, speaking in French.
""Naomi's okay now, right? Man, I can't believe you. Five years of chasing her wasn't enough? And now you've tricked Camille, who gave up two-thirds of her liver to save you!""
Damien's voice was steady, unbothered. ""I told you. I'll protect her for the rest of my life, no matter who she chooses.""
Hayden scoffed. ""You lied to Camille, married her, and used her to save Naomi. Aren't you afraid she'll find out and leave you with nothing?""
Damien responded with that same coldness that made my blood run cold. ""We were never really married. Our marriage was fake. But I do owe her. I'll make it up to her.""
Hayden was speechless. ""Damien, you're unbelievable. Are you seriously still planning to be with Naomi?""
Damien didn't answer. His silence said it all.
He continued holding my hand, smiling at me like nothing had happened, but I could feel it. The warmth of his touch was fading, and for the first time, I knew.
I had never really known him at all.
I tried to hold it together.
""What were you two talking about?"" I asked softly, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Did something happen?""
Hayden hesitated before turning to Damien and whispering in French. ""She didn't hear us, right?""
Damien, however, didn't flinch. His voice was calm like he hadn't just broken my heart.
""It's about the expedition. The higher-ups discovered a cave in Antarctica—possibly an ancient site. They're still selecting a team for the mission because it's classified.""
He lied so easily. And there, I understood everything.
I had never truly known him. Not at all.

Chapter 2
Hayden let out a relieved breath. ""Oh, I forgot—you don’t understand French. My bad. Damien and I are just used to speaking it.""
I didn’t break my gaze, keeping my eyes locked on him. My stare must’ve been enough to make him squirm because he immediately tensed, then quickly mumbled something and bolted out of the room.
Two years ago, I wouldn’t have understood a word of what they’d been saying. But I worked hard to learn French, desperate to understand Damien.
And yet, the first words I ever heard spoken in that language pierced through me like a dagger.
...
""Camille, look! I made this soup for you. Try it!""
Damien placed a bowl of chicken soup in front of me like he was presenting some kind of masterpiece. His eyes were wide, full of warmth and anticipation, like I was supposed to be grateful.
How long had he been pretending? Wasn’t he tired of all the lies?
""That’s very thoughtful of you, but I’m not really in the mood for soup,"" I said, pushing his hand away and turning over to lie back down, closing my eyes.
I saw the flicker of disappointment cross his face before he quickly masked it. Without saying another word, he set the bowl down and left the room.
It wasn’t until later, when I saw the intimacy between him and Naomi in that hospital room, that I realized—my heart wasn’t even aching anymore.
It was numb.
I turned to leave, but as I did, I locked eyes with Naomi.
She smirked, a mocking glint in her eyes.
Was she laughing at how every man I’d ever loved had walked away?
Or was she savoring the fact that I had given everything—believing in love, in happiness—only to have it all come crashing down as a lie?
I lowered my head, unable to even muster the strength to confront her. I turned back to my room, feeling utterly drained.
Right then, I realized I was just… so tired.
...
I sat on the bed for what felt like hours, lost in thought. After a while, I grabbed my phone and called Dr. Jerry Adams, the director of the Antarctic Research Institute.
""Dr. Adams, I want to join the cave exploration mission.""
There was a pause on the other end before he spoke. His voice had a cautious edge. ""Camille, are you sure about this? The mission’s classified, and it’s incredibly dangerous. You've just recovered, I’m not sure you're physically ready for something like this.""
I glanced down at the ring on my finger. ""I can do it.""
""Alright,"" he sighed, ""I’ll send you the schedule and necessary precautions. Camille... you’re just as brave as your mother. Honestly, after everything that happened three years ago, I didn’t think you’d even want to step foot in Antarctica again.""
I had thought the same. I had sworn I’d never go back.
But now? I was ready.
Three years ago, our research team, led by Damien, was deep in the snow-capped mountains on an expedition.
Out of nowhere, Naomi screamed—a piercing, blood-curdling sound that cut through the silence like a knife.
Before any of us could react, the ground shook beneath our feet. A roar filled the air as a massive avalanche descended, swallowing everything in its path.
And then, in that instant, I saw it all.
Aaron, my fiancé at the time, let go of my hand without a second thought.
No hesitation.
No panic.
It's just a cold decision.
He turned and bolted straight toward Naomi, his face etched with fear, but it was all for her.
Meanwhile, me? I was forgotten.
The snow hit with such force that it knocked me off my feet, throwing me like a ragdoll toward the edge of a cliff.
The wind howled in my ears as the snow lashed my face, and I reached out, grasping for something—anything—to hold on to. But all I caught was cold, empty air.
I was about to fall into the abyss when suddenly someone grabbed me.
'Damien...'
He lunged, throwing himself in front of me and pulling me into his arms as we tumbled together.
When we finally came to a stop, we were just inches from the cliff’s edge.
His face was pale, his lips stained with blood from the impact, but the first thing he asked was—
""Are you okay?""
Since my mom passed, that was the first time anyone had shown me real concern.
Or so I thought.
He played his part too well.

Chapter 3
For the longest time, I truly believed that Damien’s love for me was real. His pursuit, his sweet words, and the tenderness he showed made me feel special like I had finally found the one who truly cared.
But now, looking back, I see it all for what it really was. From the very beginning, it had been a lie.
His pursuit? Fake.
Our marriage? Fake.
Even his illness? Completely fake.
And somehow, I had fallen for it all—hook, line, and sinker. I had gotten trapped in his so-called love and couldn’t escape.
Dr. Adams was wrong about me. I’m not like my mother. She sacrificed everything—her life, her soul—for the country’s scientific research. But maybe... just maybe, I’d found where I truly belong.
Three days after I woke up in the hospital, Damien came in, just like always. ""Camille, how are you feeling? Any pain?"" His voice was full of concern like it had been so many times before.
But this time, I couldn’t bring myself to answer with the warmth I once had.
Instead, I gave him a cold look and said, ""I want to go home.""
He froze for a moment, hesitation flashing across his face.
After a long pause, he finally said, ""I’ll ask the doctor if you’re good to go.""
A few hours later, after a thorough check-up, I was cleared to leave. Damien took me back to the place I thought of as home.
As soon as we walked inside, I felt something was off. The whole house was decorated like a party—streamers, balloons, and a huge birthday cake sitting in the middle of the dining table.
""Happy 26th birthday, Camille!"" Damien smiled as he cupped my face in his hands and kissed me.
I stared at the cake, completely stunned. ""You remembered...""
""Of course I did,"" he said with a grin. ""Now, make a wish and blow out the candles!""
I sat down in front of the cake, still in shock, but just as I was about to close my eyes to make a wish, my phone rang. Damien’s face immediately changed. His brows furrowed, and he quickly stepped into the study to answer it.
When he came back, his face was full of urgency. ""Camille, something happened with Hayden. I need to go check on him. I’m sorry!""
Before I could even respond, he was already out the door.
A few minutes later, a video popped up on my phone. I clicked it, and suddenly, my whole world shattered.
The video showed Naomi, clinging to Damien’s sleeve, looking pale and fragile like she was about to break.
""Damien, I’m pregnant! I can’t believe it—I’m really pregnant! What should I do?"" she cried, her voice shaky.
Damien wiped away her tears, his expression serious and reassuring. ""Don’t worry, Naomi. I’ll take care of you and the baby.""
Naomi’s eyes filled with fear as she asked, ""But Aaron... he died in a car accident! What if my child grows up without a father?""
""Don’t worry,"" Damien said, his voice soft but firm. ""I promise you, I’ll be the father to this child.""
And with that, Naomi collapsed into his arms, her face lighting up with hope.
I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt like it was being crushed. I was trembling as I held the phone. The image of them holding each other was seared into my mind. Each second of that moment felt like a hammer, striking over and over.
My vision blurred as hot tears spilled down my cheeks, one after another, without control.
Instinctively, my hand moved to my abdomen.
I remembered the ultrasound—how tiny she was, how fragile. She should have been here.
But the doctor had told me I couldn’t undergo a liver transplant while pregnant. The decision was made for me, and I had no choice but to go through with the termination of pregnancy.
At first, I was so happy when I found out I was pregnant. I wanted to give her the best life.
But in this cruel twist, I had taken away her right to live.
And her father? He was making promises to another woman, vowing to be a father to her child.
""Why? Why are you doing this to me?!"" I screamed, my voice breaking. I swiped my arm across the table, knocking the cake off and watching as it crashed to the floor.
I swept everything off the table—plates, glasses—all of it scattered to the ground.
But no matter how much I broke or shattered, the only thing that remained was the suffocating pain in my chest.

Chapter 4
I sat there on the floor, overwhelmed, my sobs echoing in the empty house. The weight of everything was crushing me.
By the time Damien finally returned, I was standing in front of the mirror, staring at the scars from my surgery. Its reflection was all I could see. The deep reminders of the sacrifices I made for him.
Damien approached me, his steps hesitant, like he wasn’t sure what to say.
He rested his head on my shoulder, his voice thick with emotion as he said, “Camille, thank you. I promise I’ll make it up to you. I’ll treat you twice as well from now on.”
I didn’t even look at him. My eyes remained fixed on the scars on my body.
And under my breath, I muttered, “Disgusting!”
Then, before I even realized it, I started rubbing at the scars, over and over, desperately trying to scrub them away.
But the pain, it didn’t even register. I couldn’t stop myself.
Damien panicked, rushing to grab my wrists, trying to hold me still. “They’re not disgusting! If you don’t like them, I’ll find the best doctor to remove them. Just please, stop!”
He pulled me into his arms, lifting me back onto the bed. But I barely felt it.
It wasn’t until I looked into his eyes that I realized something was different. I reached out without thinking, touching the scar between his brows—the one he got when he saved me that day in the avalanche.
“Some scars can never be erased,” I said softly, my voice barely a whisper.
Damien didn’t say anything. He just sat there, staying close to me for the next week as if waiting for me to break.
One evening, as I stared out the window, my thoughts heavy, I turned to him and said, “I want roasted chestnuts from Night Garden Street.”
Without a second thought, he grabbed his car keys and rushed out the door.
I used to love how he’d never say no to any request I made. But now, I knew the truth—it wasn’t love. It was guilt.
As soon as Damien left, I grabbed a cab and went straight to the VIP hospital suite.
Naomi was there, sipping soup, looking completely unfazed. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in. It was like she was expecting me.
She casually took another sip, her eyes meeting mine with that same smirk.
“I know what you’re thinking,” she said. “Damien and I grew up together. He’s my childhood sweetheart. I was the one who told him to pursue you.”
I didn’t say anything. I just stared at her, my anger bubbling up.
She seemed to enjoy my silence, watching me like I was some kind of show.
Finally, I broke the silence, my voice barely above a whisper. “You were never sick, were you?”
She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, then grinned. “Nope. Thanks for the liver, though. I never used it... threw it to a stray dog. Hilarious, right?”
The words hit me like a punch to the gut. A hot rage spread through me, my hands shaking with fury. I wanted to lash out, to rip her apart.
But it wasn’t just about her. It was about him.
“Damien never loved you,” Naomi said, as she stood up and sauntered over to me. She casually tapped my abdomen with her finger, that cruel smile still on her lips. “By the way, how does it feel to kill your own child?”
“Shut up!” I screamed, the rage exploding.
I shoved her with everything I had, sending her stumbling backward. But at that exact moment, the door burst open.
“Stop!”
Damien rushed in, grabbing my wrist and throwing me to the ground. Without a second thought, he picked up Naomi and cradled her in his arms.
His eyes, cold and piercing, looked down at me. “Camille, Naomi is sick. You shouldn’t have laid a hand on her!”
Sick? He didn’t seem to care that I was just as much of a patient.
But he ignored that. He was too busy paying attention to Naomi, making sure she was okay.
I just stared at his back, my body trembling, my heart numb. There was no point anymore. I picked myself up and walked out without a word.
...
Back at home, I laid everything out on the coffee table—everything that had been a lie. The fake marriage papers,the precautions after termination of pregnancy surgery, the recording of my confrontation with Naomi.
I put a note next to them, written in French:
[We’re even. From now on, we are strangers in life and death.]
Then, without another word, I walked out the door and headed straight for the airport.",1,1739361673.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

How the c market price surge will impact independent farmers in the short term; what happens if the market collapses?

What is the role of speculators in the market?

1inp2mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1inp2mg/postpartum_rage_and_guilt/,Postpartum rage and guilt,"I'm currently 1 month postpartum and last night I had a full blown episode of what I can only assume was postpartum rage. I feel so incredibly guilty about it and I don't know how to cope.

My baby has a great demeanor, so it wasn't about him crying or fussing or anything like that. He sleeps well and he has been perfect. My husband was the target of this episode and I feel horrible for how I treated him. My baby wakes up periodically through the night for feedings and I'm currently breastfeeding and pumping. I'm also terrified of SIDS, so I've  taken to staying awake for the majority of the night and my husband takes over caring for the baby around sunrise so I can sleep for a few hours before having to get up to pump again. 

My husband has offered flexibility to the best of his abilities (he works during the day and I stay home) and has made it clear that I can wake him up earlier if I need him. I feel guilty waking him up, so I've been particularly sleep deprived and I think that definitely contributed to my meltdown.

The nights alone with the baby get very lonely and I often find myself feeling depressed during the night. I dread the time of night that my husband goes to bed because that's when it sinks in that I'm going to be alone and tired for hours on end caring for our son. Last night right before he went to bed, the feeling started creeping up on me and I started complaining to him about the sleeping arrangements. I told him I don't feel loved, and that he and my son would be better off without me and that I feel like I'm drowning every time he leaves me for the night. I don't always feel that way but as of lately I have been especially hard on myself,feeling like there's no way I can ever do enough to keep everything afloat on my own. I felt my mood  shift, and this is where I feel very guilty and I'm not proud of myself, but I started blaming him for my emotions. I was taking it all out in him. 

So he snapped a little bit, because he's been doing his part and he told me he didn't know how to make me feel better. And that he needed some space away from me for a bit but then he could get up in the middle of the night to help take some of the weight off of my back for my night shift with the baby.In that moment the offer made me feel like I was weak and that I couldn't do enough to hold up my end of the responsibilities. This escalated into a full blown argument. In the moment I felt so unheard and misunderstood and I was not expressing myself properly at this point. He ended up locking himself in the bedroom to get away from me and that's when I really lost it. I was screaming and banging on the door for what felt like forever. He eventually came to the door and opened it and was trying to calm me down but it was too late. I was full blown raging and yelling things I like how he didn't love me and I didn't want to exist anymore. I could tell he was really scared but didn't know how to help so he was getting pretty frustrated. 

I eventually calmed down enough to let him go to bed, but in the morning when he woke up I could tell he was very tired and he was pretty angry with me about how I was acting, and rightfully so. I apologized profusely to him and cried and told him how horrible I felt. He needed a cup of coffee or two before he was able to forgive me. He said that everything is fine between us now.But the guilt I feel is immeasurable.

 I feel like a failure of a wife and mother. All day I've felt so much dread and I hate myself right now for what I did. It's resulted in total neglect for myself for a day and I ended up oversleeping, which caused my breasts to become completely over engorged and I was starting to get what I think was the beginning signs of mastitis. I started icing and pumping,  and hand expressing in a hot shower, which has helped a little bit. But I feel so guilty for neglecting myself because it makes it harder to properly care for my baby when I'm not doing my best. I have no idea how I will emotionally recover from this. I'm even more depressed tonight because of last night. My house is a mess. My mind and body are going haywire. I feel so bad for my husband and baby and I feel like I don't  deserve them. 

I'm thinking about asking my doctor about antidepressants,  but I don't want to stop breastfeeding. Does anyone have any experience or advice on what I should do to help pull myself out of this funk? I'm at a total loss here. Postpartum depression seems like it is so stigmatized sometimes and I'm worried that people will deem me an unfit mother if I tell them how I really feel. My husband seems to think that won't be the case and thinks I should just talk to my doctor to see what to do. ",3,1739361332.0,Mommit,5,1.0,False

I’m a 30-year-old guy software developer from Asker/Oslo who traded an *Asian summer* for *Norwegian snowstorms* (best decision ever). I moved here for work, but let’s be real—I mostly stayed for the skiing, hiking, and the *all-you-can-breathe fresh air buffet*.

Looking for a cool person to explore new places with, do fun activities, and hopefully build something meaningful—starting with friendship and letting it grow into something beautiful (like a sourdough starter, but with less stress).

A bit about me:

* Vegetarian 🌱 (but I promise I don’t judge your bacon).
* Not really into clubbing, but down for a glass of wine (or whatever fuels your existential crises) over dinner with friends.
* Love skiing—both cross-country and downhill (because why choose one when you can fall gracefully in multiple ways?).
* Used to play guitar, but it’s been in hibernation. If you love music, maybe we can wake it up together! 🎸
* Can cook! Which means you *might* get free food if you play your cards right.
* My Norwegian is *okish*, meaning I can order food, survive small talk, and probably make some awkward grammar mistakes.

If you’re up for fun adventures, good laughs, and possibly watching me attempt (and fail) to make perfectly round chapatis, hit me up!

Let’s go on a hike, ski trip, or just share embarrassing life stories over coffee. 🚀.

Maganda yung place—may lobby, coffee shop, elevator, at maayos tingnan, kaya napili ko siyang tirahan dahil sa trabaho. Pero habang tumatagal, sobrang na-ooff ako sa management. Ang unprofessional nila, at ramdam ko rin sa Viber group namin na maraming tenants ang may reklamo.

Ang dami nilang atraso, kaya gusto ko lang ilabas galit ko: 

1.	Walang transparency sa kuryente. Hindi nila pinapakita yung actual Meralco bill. Basta bibigyan ka lang ng invoice sa katapusan ng buwan. May isang tenant na nagtanong sa Viber group kung pwede makita yung bill for transparency—walang sagot. Tapos ngayon, restricted na ang group chat, admin/host lang pwedeng mag-chat. Hindi ko na rin mahanap yung message na yun, baka dinelete nila? Sure akong minamagic nila yung kuryente kasi noong December, holiday season, 2 weeks na walang tao sa unit, pero paglabas ng invoice ng January, aba! Ganun pa rin yung babayaran sa kuryente. Paanong hindi nagbago yung consumption kahit walang gumagamit?

2.	Biglaang pagtaas ng water bill. Sa contract namin, Php 100/month ang bayad sa tubig regardless of consumption. Pero isang araw, bigla silang nag-announce sa Viber na magiging Php 200 per month na PER HEAD. Tinanong ko kung applicable ba ito sa lahat o sa mga bagong kontrata lang—sabi nila pati sa existing. Eh anong silbi ng kontrata kung pwede lang nila basta-basta baguhin?

 3.	Super poor sa communication. Kada bayad ko ng rent/bills, sinasend ko agad ang proof of payment sa email nila. Ina-acknowledge naman nila, pero after a day or two, magfo-follow up sila aggressively, na kesyo di pa raw bayad. Kapag sinabi mong nasend mo na at inacknowledge na nila, ikaw pa masisisi—dapat daw sinend din sa Facebook page nila?! Eh sa email nga nila nakalagay na dun dapat isend! Ilang beses nang nangyari ito.

4.	Delayed security deposit refund. Nag-move out ako last January 29, at ayon sa contract, within 7-14 days dapat ang refund ng security deposit. Pero hanggang ngayon, wala pa rin. Kahapon lang, bigla nila akong chinat kung ibabawas daw ba sa deposit ko yung ‘unpaid balance’ ko bago ako umalis. HUH? Binayaran ko yun at sinend ko ang proof of payment! Ayan na naman sila!

Buti nakaalis na ako sa impyernong dorm na ‘to. Pag nakuha ko lang yung security deposit ko, bibigyan ko sila ng honest (read: pangit) review sa FB page nila. Hindi ako makapagreklamo noon kasi baka mapalayas ako, pero ngayon, wala na akong pake.

This is probably TMI but I need some input. I already spoke to my grandma (who’s a nurse and had the surgery years ago) as well as the doc I work for (I am a nurse as well). I am so stumped.

I can’t poo. On Monday it got to the point where I was having this sharp stabbing pain in my left abdomen, I was freaking out because it was right where the incision is that they removed a portion of my stomach from. It went away after I woke up.
I know straining on the toilet is bad, but I have tried pushing because I am just so desperate.

I have tried Miralax, I have taken a double dose of bisacodyl. Usually these two things alone will open the flood gates. I have upped my water intake. I have tried coffee. I have been moving. Maybe I’m not eating enough? I don’t know. I was advised not to track my calories yet. I am 7 months post op and I have a general idea of the calories in the foods I’m consuming.

I had beef pot roast with mashed cauliflower on Sunday, I’m wondering if that’s why I’m struggling so bad? I had leftovers for lunch at work on Monday. I’ve been struggling before that though. I just moved in October and have an appointment set up to establish care with a new doc, but that isn’t until the end of next month. I could reach out to my old surgeon and see their thoughts.

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated.

I closed half of the position last Friday, before NFP release and moved SL to BE (which wasn’t hit). That half position closed was equal to a little bit less than 0.5% gain.

As this week’s score is -8.5, I decided not to close my trade on Monday and left it open.

1inolyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1inolyi/arbo_and_advice_disapproval/,arbo and advice disapproval,"Hi,
I have been on sick leave for 4 months due to burnout, depression and toxic work environment that lead to social anxiety. I attended to therapy, take medication and slowly go out.
I said to arbo that my boss wants to meet for a coffee but it's stressing me out and makes anxious and.. (to my surprise) arbo advice is to meet with the employer for coffee and talk.. I said I am not able to do that and I won't (started to crying). He ask are you approve or disapprove advice. I said disapprove.
What now? I know I can take a second opinion but as I don't have energy for this bull*hit, is there any option WITHOUT that:
Will I be in trouble if I said that I won't do that? Well if I really have to do it I will, but do I need to do something legally?
Thanks and I wish all with burnout in NL to recover soon.

1inoho2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1inoho2/i_find_you_attractive_intelligent_connect/,"""I find you attractive, intelligent, connect emotionally with you, but I am not attracted to you""","I (30m) started dating a girl (25f) 2 weeks ago. She hasn't been kissed before, nor been in a relationship.

First date was very nice. Good activities and conversation - we were comfortable with shoulder touches, waist touches, and even leg touches during conversation. I tried a kiss, to which she said she was very nervous and scared. I found it adorable, I told her it's okay and walked back to her car, holding her hand. We both enjoyed it.

The next night we went for a short walk together where the conversation flowed well. No kiss attempt.

  
Date 2: I ask how she feels about me, to which she responds ""I'm not sure. Idk if this is just a case of two nice people enjoying each other's company but nothing more."" bla bla.

I respond: ""I think you're just scared""

Her: ""I think you're right""

Me: ""Have you kissed a guy before?""

Her turning away embarrassed and giggly: ""No""

Me while we are already close, taking things really slow making sure I'm not pushing her too far: ""Would you like to try a kiss?""

Her: ""No tongue, just a peck""

Me joking: ""Nooo, I need to go down your throat with my tongue.""

Her giggling: ""Noooooo. hahahaha.""

She comes and gives me a little peck.

I tell her that was nice and that the fun thing about kissing and getting closer to someone is the act of trying again, and exploring and having fun together finding what each other likes. Drove her home, exchanged a couple of pecks goodbye.

  
Third date: Went and had a coffee together then walked to a park where we had a nice conversation and again connected well. At the end of the date, dropping her off home she said in the car: ""I know you're expecting a kiss.""

Me: ""I'm not, but it would be nice.""

Her: ""I'm not feeling comfortable.""

Me: ""That's okay.""

She stays in my car... After a minute of silence she brings up something random - literally the weather maybe? Something along those lines. We small talk for 5 minutes and I look at her and she gives me shy giggles. I lean towards her and she says she's not comfortable. I ask her if she's going to get out.

Her: ""I don't want to seem rude and leave mid conversation.""

Me: ""Wdym? We aren't talking about anything, I came to drop you off?""

She stays in the car for another long few minutes with small talk... until she finally leaves. I text her later playfully about how I need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a strategy for affection from her. Good exchange.

  
Fourth date: Went to an arcade and had a laugh, played some games. Grabbed a bubble tea and sat down for a while talking about nothing pretty much - small talk. Small touches the whole way through (I keep mentioning small touches to indicate to you, the reader, that physical touch has been a normal thing for us). I drive us to a park where I tell her that my intentions are a relationship, to which she says that's also what she wants but that she isn't feeling the spark. ""I find you attractive, intelligent, connect emotionally with you, but I am not attracted to you"". I asked if it was a comfort thing, she said no. I asked if this is her having expectations and building up what she thinks you're meant to feel as she's inexperienced and she said she's not sure.

This girl has been texting me, and even calling me if I didn't initiate. She's been asking for outings with me if I didn't initiate one. How can you show so much interest yet not be attracted?

Me: ""Am I pressuring you, and pushing you away by bringing this up?""

Her: ""No, you've made me very comfortable and I am open to commitment with the right person.""

Me: ""You've said you find me physically attractive. You've said you find me intelligent. You've said you feel emotionally understood, and connected deeply with me. Is this a you thing?

Her: ""No, I just don't feel it with you.""

Me: ""Okay, well I feel glad that I brought this up because I feel like I'm disrespecting myself chasing someone not that into me. But I know that's bullshit because you are into me. You have me very confused, which makes me think you must also be confused, or at the very least aren't telling me everything.""

Her: ""What do you want to do moving forward?""

Why the fuck would she ask me this. She said she's not into me, but is asking me to make a decision moving forward. In my mind, I think she is inexperienced, not knowing what she's meant to feel and wants me to make all the moves which I have been.

Me: ""You're not that into me, so I'm not going to chase you. You need to have a think about what you want, and get back to me... Or not, that's okay too.""

Her: ""I'm not going to leave you hanging, I'll definitely contact you again.""

1inogg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1inogg4/i_lost_167_pounds_naturally_i_never_thought_life/,I lost 167 pounds naturally - I never thought life could be this good,"Hey everyone, 

  
So I wanted to just post something that I hope will help anyone feeling a little lost, or like their route to weight loss is getting a little tough.

March 2023, I stepped on the scales for the first time in over a year. It flashed up. **345.5.** I was stumped. In shock perhaps. For reference, I was 26 at the time, and am **5'5 and a female**. I hit rock bottom, genuinely. Although I was crawling around there for a while. 

Outwardly, I was confident, referring to myself as 'fat', pretending to not care. Loud and funny, certain of herself.

Inwardly, I was dying. Walking more than 5 minutes caused severe back pain. I was always sweating, out of breath constantly. I couldn't breath at night due to the fat on my chest and around my neck. I hated leaving the house, going for a food shop, going for coffees, exploring a new town. Essentially, living life. Everything was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful. 

To cope, I drank most weekend, partied to try and forget how much I hated the prison I was in. I had a job that had me on my feet all day, but the second I got through that door in the evening, I ate. Every day was centred around food. I followed the body positive movement (no hate, I believe no one should feel shame about their bodies), but it actually enabled me. I told myself 'nothing is wrong with me, it is okay to be fat'. And yes, morally there is nothing wrong with me. I am not a morally superior woman now than I was at 345.5 pounds. But that isn't the point. I wasn't living anymore. Online, I saw other fat women post themselves and they looked so confident. I thought that I wasn't trying 'hard enough' to love myself like they could. 

  
So one day, I started counting calories, and I haven't stopped. I took it day by day, and thought, today, I am a little closer to a happier and healthier me. I started going for small walks, and these became longer and a little faster. I started talking to some trusted people about my feelings. I planned my next day. I then started thinking about how I could get more protein in, then more water. 

I celebrated the wins, and didn't beat myself up over any blips or 'stalls'. I forgot the timeline, and broke my weight loss into little chunks. I thought 'wow, can't wait to get into the next 10's of pounds (eg. 280 - 279), or the next stone bracket.

  
I never stopped getting my hair done, or my nails done. I focused on wearing what I felt comfortable in for that day. I laughed, I listened to good music, drank good coffee, and started going on adventures again.

  
I look back on myself from two years ago, and my initial reaction is 'god, how did I get there, I looked awful' I have had some people say similar things. But like with them, I stop myself and go, 'it was that version of me that took the first step, not this version of me. The only thing wrong with me was that I was lost'. 

  
I can't believe how good life is now. I have found pockets of happiness or content in the every day life, mostly! Because that is where the change is - in your day. Get today right, and you'll get to where you want to be. But please know, each day is one step closer. I am so delighted that I have taken that first step. 

  
There were moments that I thought 'this is too hard, I want to live a little'. But living, to me, was learning some discipline and reaching for that delayed gratification instead of the instant kind. I am strong, resilient and capable of great things. 

  
Please keep going, focus on the day, get it right and you can't go wrong. 

  
My ultimate goal is 150, and I know I will get there. But I am focusing on today, and the next week so I can plan for anything that may be a challenge. I am excited. And always reminding myself of how my life has improved beyond my body. 

  
Some tips that have helped me:

1. Plan out tomorrow. I know what I will have for each meal, along with when I will do my walk. I lay out my clothes for work, along with my walking clothes. I have meal prepped and everything is ready to go.

2. Focus on the day. I keep saying it, but seriously. How can you make your day a successful one? What does that look like to you. It is easy for my mind to run and say 'oh my god, I have X pounds to lose still'. Okay yes that is true. But I am going to focus on today, as this will get me a little closer. I can focus on the inputs. 

3. Calorie tracking. Before losing weight, there were days I was CONVINCED I wasn't eating 'that' much. The modern body pos/fat movement convinced me that I was meant to be this way. I wasn't. I was eating so much junk food, that it didn't appear like a lot at times, and I was always 'hungry' for actual nutrition. 

4. Not every day will be perfect, that is okay. There have been days and periods of time (hello Christmas) where I wasn't eating in a caloric deficit, or going for my daily walk. That's okay, I just back to it. It is helpful to give yourself a time period of not tracking. Over Christmas, I chose the days overall where I wouldn't track. And I knew which days I was getting back to my normal routine. This helps a lot. Stick to it. I know that I am going away for a weekend next month. Friday and Saturday will not be tracked. That's okay. I am going for my food shop Sunday, I know what I like to eat on a weekly basis. Having a deadline for yourself is key!

5. It's all about those habits. Doing something most days, such as your caloric deficit or your walk, will get you to where you want to be. It's simple, not easy. You don't need to do anything crazy, it's just a bit boring at times. Find comfort in that.

6. Dress for the you TODAY. Don't stop taking care of yourself. Showing myself that I am a human that should always be treated with kindness and respect has really built up my self confidence. I used to have zero. I remind myself to walk with confidence. Some days are better than others. But this has really helped me to understand that there is no 'good' and 'bad' versions of myself! 

7. Take that focus away from your physical looks. I used to think 'I have to go for this walk to burn calories', and now I think 'I get to go on my walk, I feel good mentally and helps with my stress levels, those happy chemicals really help me!'

8. Following/reading weight loss material that feels GOOD for you. I looked at what I was reading and who I was following. I don't want to have a super ripped or toned body. I wanted to find people, women especially that lost a lot of weight, and are realistic for me. This forum helps me to focus on the positive, and it's great seeing those who have walked before me. 

  
Thanks for reading, any tips you would give? And again, not every day is perfect. I am always learning. But taking a break for a moment and looking back, I am so proud of myself. I am proud of all of you! ",74,1739358395.0,loseit,15,0.98,False

I had been chatting with him ( him 27 ( bottom) me 31 ( Top ) m)  for a   week before we finally met for coffee. He was the most handsome and respectful man I had ever met—there was something special and unique about him that I couldn't quite put into words.

From the start, I felt drawn to him. He listened attentively, spoke thoughtfully, and carried himself with a quiet confidence that made him even more attractive. But there was something else—something I couldn't ignore. Whenever I tried to bring up more intimate topics, he would subtly steer the conversation away or give a vague response.

Then, one evening, he admitted, “I’m still new to the gay world.” That explained a lot. He wasn’t avoiding intimacy because he wasn’t interested—he just wasn’t used to navigating it.

On top of that, he had a lot on his plate. He had just started his master’s in data science and engineering and was struggling to find a student job. I could see how much it stressed him out. Naturally, I offered to help him financially, but he refused. “I appreciate it, but I need to do this on my own,” he had said firmly.

That was new for me. I wasn’t used to being in this kind of situation—wanting to help but having to step back and respect his independence. At the same time, I really liked him. He was different from most guys I’d met, many of whom were more open, more forward—even a little slutty, to be honest. But he wasn’t like that, and I liked that about him. I wanted something real, something long-term, but I wasn’t sure how to approach it with someone still figuring things out.

I even considered leaving some money for him anonymously, slipping it into his bag or hiding it somewhere he’d find it. That way, he wouldn’t feel pressured, and it might ease his stress a little. But would that be the right thing to do? Would he accept it if he knew it was from me?

Should I just keep supporting him in other ways? Invite him to the cinema? Go hiking together? Something casual and low-pressure? I didn’t want to rush him, but I also didn’t want to stay in this uncertain phase forever. He was different, and maybe that was a good thing. I just had to figure out how to move forward without scaring him away.

1inoest,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1inoest/el_conquistador_daynight_two/,El Conquistador Day/Night Two,"Day two and night two at El Conquistador in Puerto Rico were spent enjoying the resort. The property has four different pool areas, including an indoor water park. We spent most of the day at the upper pool, which features two hot tubs, a swim-up bar, and two restaurants—Café Bella Vista (an American grill) and La Ezkina (a Mexican/Spanish grill).

For breakfast, we opted for some espresso and Açaí bowls at OATS on the resort. It was delicious and a great way to start the day!

For lunch, we chose La Ezkina, and the food was excellent. We had guacamole and chips, fish tacos, and a quesadilla. Everything was great, and the service was friendly. Our server even chatted with us about the excursions we had booked, which at the time seemed like they would work out.

Originally, we had planned to take a catamaran ride to Culebra Island on Wednesday, which included lunch, activities, and a visit to one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. However, due to wind and weather conditions, the trip was modified to an island we already have free access to through the resort. So, we decided to cancel.

While discussing alternatives with our server, she suggested taking a taxi to the ferry and heading to Vieques instead, where we could rent a golf cart for the day. When I spoke with the concierge about changing plans, she helped set everything up, including taxis to and from the ferry, as well as recommendations for beaches, food, and other activities on the island.

For dinner, we ate at the lower marina at a restaurant called BallyHoo, which features seafood and steak. We both had the Mahi Mahi, served over a homemade chickpea stew—it was very, very good and the view/scenery was perfect right off the water in the marina. 

To get to some parts of the resort, you have to take a funicular, which is basically an elevator that goes down a hill. It’s very easy to use, and the wait has always been minimal.

One thing to note, as I mentioned yesterday, is the spending! It’s very easy to run up a bill at the resort while dining out and having drinks. There are a few spots to fill your water bottle, so bringing your own is a must to save at a minimum $3 per bottle. One refill station is at the lower pool by La Ezkina. Your room does include coffee and two bottles of water each day, which helps save a few bucks. We’re on vacation, so we’re not overly worried about it, but $5 here and there adds up quickly. Anything you can bring into the resort helps, and if you can plan a trip on your own instead of booking a resort excursion, you can save money too.

1inoczg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1inoczg/what_should_i_do_next/,What should I do next?,"My partner drove our daughter to the ER because she was having trouble breathing, and I took off from work to meet them there. She was taken in and placed on oxygen and they started drawing blood and running scans before I arrived. When I got there my partner was speaking to a nurse and a doctor about our daughter's medical history and I joined them.

They asked about cystic fibrosis, Interstitial lung disease and a few other things, to which I answered that she had no history on any of our sides, but my partner told them she was not sure. My partner then pulled me aside and told me that my daughter is likely not my child, as she was having an affair with a friend of hers around the time of conception. 

After that, I don't remember much to be honest. The next thing I knew I was sitting at the hospital's cafeteria with coffee and a sandwich on the table and a doctor came by to tell me my daughter had would need surgery for an abscess  in her lungs and was already intubated. I signed something she put in front of me and sat there for some time. My partner was nowhere to be found at that point.

The short of it is that my daughter is doing ok now, her surgery was a month and a half ago and she is doing PT in order to restore her breathing. My partner started reaching out a few hours after leaving the hospital, but at that point my phone was dead and her side of the family had arrived and were conveying me her messages.

I don't know what to do now. I haven't slept properly in weeks. I am a small business owner, so everyday I don't work stacks up. Today, I rolled my car into traffic while at a stop light. I hope it was because I fell asleep on the wheel. My daughter is with me and my partner is staying with her brother and I told them they needed to take her for a few days until I can figure something out with my work and routine, but I am afraid they will not give me my kid back, considering my state. Another thing on my mind is that the biological father now knows he has a daughter, and might fight for custody away from me.

I have done two therapy sessions so far, but there simply is no time and I feel like the money should be spent on my daughters recovery. What would you guys do?

1inocja,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1inocja/wibtah_for_giving_up_on_my_ex_and_his_farm_even/,WIBTAH for giving up on my ex and his farm even though I am their only non-family employee?," So, I (23F) work with my friend/ex? (we tried dating, it didn't work out but were still friends) James (27M) at his family farm with his brother Jack (29M), and his parents Daniel and Becca (60's). I've worked at their farm as a side job for $10/hr since last May. The farm work was usually simple (milking cows) but there were quite a few 10+ hr days I would help with as well. 

Overtime, I started devoting most of my spare time to the farm, even trying to keep better track of the cattle for them (they had different information written down, but it wasn't consistent, and I was having a lot of trouble finding and transferring the data to an all-together document). I did the documentation in my own personal time off the clock as well. With being at the farm more I was around James a lot of the time since I worked with him more than anyone else. 

I became more and more dedicated to their farm and at the same time fell in love with James, and about 2 months of working at their farm James and I started dating, keeping our relationship private except to our parents/family for personal reasons. We spent the whole summer together and I truly enjoyed it so much, especially working at the farm with them! I love his family, and cows are my favorite animal, so it was a job I really enjoyed. I always helped in the parlor with James and Mr. Daniel, and occasionally in the calf barn as needed. Eventually, James stopped working in the parlor and instead worked on other misc. jobs and feeding calves and I started helping in the mornings too.

From a relationship standpoint, James has always been kind to me. He even bought me flowers once! He has been such a light in the darkness for me other the past year, always there to comfort me through some tough times. I was in a previous relationship where my ex constantly lied to me, tricked me into having sex with him, and emotionally manipulated me any chance that he got. That relationship left me very distrusting of guys from then on. I was even having frequent nightmares of being raped since dating my ex. It wasn't until a friend of mine talked with me through it that I accepted what happened and was finally able to heal (thanks Dev!). 

I'm not sure why I trusted James in the first place, but I did, and he always treated me so well. He would respect my boundaries and be so caring and loving.

 I started to notice that in the mornings he would be very late to feeding the calves so I would often have to get the milk out for him or have to feed the calves myself. We get milk out of the line for the calves during when the cows are being milked that way its fresh and still warm. At first, this didn't bother me any but after a while it was seriously getting on my nerves. The reason? It would be 10-10:30 in the morning before he shows up (we start at 6, it takes about 4 hrs in the morning to milk) because he's just FINALLY getting out of bed and getting his coffee made. I would constantly complain about this as well as other similar situations, but he would always complain that I am micro-managing him. It's frustrating because it makes me have to drop what I am doing just to go do his job which takes longer for us to get done in the parlor. If he shows up while I am getting milk out, he'll just yell at me saying ""he will get it"" and won't stop until I stop and leave. Sometimes, he is so late at showing up that we are done in the parlor AND I have all of the calves already fed for him sometimes TMR fed too though not often. One of the days that I had started feeding the tmr he showed up coffee in hand and thanked me for feeding the calves as it ""lets him have time to get other things done"" to which I got upset about because he's just got out of bed and hasn't done anything. Not only does he wait until very last minute in the mornings but at night too. It's so bad that even his dad called him ""the prodigal son"" when he finally showed up, joking of course but it upsets him too when others have to do James' job. If I complain he gets defensive and says, ""What, so I don't have anything else I have to do?"" which I know he does but at the same time he complains when I put another job above milking saying that the chores come first. I sometimes ask him to come help in the parlor {more frequently lately) too because I'll sometimes have bad health episodes or if I am simply just exhausted, but he always brushes it off and never comes and helps. At this point I am very frustrated. If I call him he just flat out ignores my calls all the time. He makes the excuse that he ignores others sometimes but he's constantly ignoring me. We decided to cut things off between us romantically at around the beginning of January. Since then, the problem seems like it's only gotten worse. 

Since our break up, he would still frequently hug me which I have no problem with but when the break up was still very fresh he would also intimately touch me and kiss me. Neither of us truly wanted to break things off but we decided it was for the best, so I didn't really have a problem with it, but we agreed to stop altogether. Even though we agreed to stop he would still continue to smack my ass and touch me intimately but get upset when I would to him. He's constantly ignoring me and what feels like pretends I don't exist. He'll kiss me out of nowhere or hug me and pull me close one minute and completely push me away the next, become cold, distant, and yet won't say he doesn't love me. If I have a problem with anything he ignores me, justifies it, or blames me! 

He makes it sound like I am constantly annoying him which I dont think is true? I don't talk to him at all anymore outside of work. I dont call him and I hardly text him anymore. I stopped calling him at work and I hardly see him if at all some days. It feels like I'm being led on at times but I guess I'm not?  I have no clue what to think anymore. I've been stressed beyond belief lately and exhausted so much that as soon as I come home I sleep. I've been falling behind in my studies and my mental health has taken a hit from this I can tell. I just don't know what to do anymore. If I stay I just don't know how much more I can take of this exhaustion but if I go then that leaves everybody else more stressed out and Mr. Daniel alone in the parlor more frequently.

In all honesty I just don't know if I have the heart to leave. I love the cows and being at the farm and I love James and his family. But James and the disorganization of how they do things is stressing me out. Every time I point out the level of disorganization to James it's only ever various excuses out of his mouth. I just don't know what to do or why I even care still. So, WIBTAH if I left them and the farm?



(Another thing if I did however, I board my horse there for very cheap and if I left than I would have to pay 2.5 times as much cheapest as I am now a month. Being a student, that increase would be very difficult to afford)

1ino7ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ino7ig/brainway_app_review_my_honest_experience/,Brainway app review: my honest experience,"So, i found out about this app on reddit and wanted to share my experience with you, maybe there are more people like me.  
  
I’ve been testing out the Brainway app for a few weeks now, and I wanted to share my experience with it in case anyone here is looking for tools to improve focus and productivity.

At its core, the app tracks things like mood, energy levels, sleep, and even habits like caffeine intake. One of the most surprising takeaways for me was seeing patterns I hadn’t really noticed before, like how skipping breakfast or overloading on coffee leads to an energy crash later in the day, making it harder to focus and stay on task.

One thing I do like is the small actionable challenges the app suggests, like a morning stretch routine or limiting social media time. I wasn’t expecting much from those, but surprisingly, they did help me stay more engaged throughout the day. The step-tracking challenge, in particular, helped me break up long work sessions and avoid falling into endless scrolling.

That being said, the app does require regular input, which can feel like another task to keep up with. I also wish it had a feature for tracking deep work sessions or integrating with existing productivity tools to make the insights more actionable.

For anyone who struggles with procrastination or wants to identify what’s affecting their focus, it could be useful, especially if you’re someone who benefits from seeing trends in your behavior over time. If you’re already highly structured and disciplined, you might not find it as necessary, but for those trying to build better habits, it could be a helpful tool.

Has anyone else here tried it? Curious to hear if it’s helped you improve focus or break unproductive cycles ",25,1739357498.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

Few month ago i bought a second hand **delonghi dedica** with her **grinder delonghi kg520** and it frequently happen that the portafilter is cloggeed, maybe because i tamp too much the coffee...

But since few days it happen too frequently, i've done a descaling with vinegar after seeing the descaling indicator but it doesnt seem to be enough

I always to the same : 14g of fresh beans, grinder set on the finest option, 13.8g of grind beans, tamp but not too much

Sometime its good, sometime the portafilter is cloggeed... Its as if there is not enough pression so the water fail to cross the coffee.

Most of the time when the portafilter is clogged, the dedica became quieter and the coffee doesnt flow so i need to open it clean it and renew my process but sometime if i wait and click again on the single espresso button a pressure release is heard after few seconds like you let the pression decrease and the coffee finaly flow

**Does any of you ever had this problem ?**

**Should i change a piece, use a botomless portafilter or do a better descaling ?**

Hope my dedica isnt brocken (even if that could explain and solve the problem ahah)

1ino5rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1ino5rk/am_i_right_feeling_neglected/,Am I right feeling neglected?,"My wife (33) and I (36) have been together for 14 years. 3 yrs ago we officially moved in together and we did in a new country. We also work together at a startup but we rarely spend time working together anymore. I work from an office, she preferred working from home, and I spend all day in meetings or with customers and her job is less demanding. When I'm home I've noticed she's playing games or starts working late afternoon, etc.

She went through depression when we first moved in to this country because she didn't speak the language. She found comfort in playing videogames with some existing and new friends that speak her native language.

I think she's fine now, but she turned gaming + chatting into a daily thing and like a religion. She gets upset or defensive when I ask her to do something with me instead of spending time with her friends gaming.

Our routine is like we wake up, she prepares breakfast, I help with coffee or minor things or walk out the dog, breakfast together, I leave for work. I come back for lunch 2-3pm, and immediately after lunch she goes back to the computer to work/browse Internet/games. That's where sometimes she's working or gaming or multitasking while speaking with a friend at times.

After I get home (6pm or so) she's already shut herself in our guest room with headphones and door closed and she's just playing videogames with some 7-8 friends (all guys). This lasts all the way to going to sleep around 12:30am. Sometimes I hear that there's only one guy left and she's spending from like 10:30pm to 12:30am with that one friend. And it makes me feel jealous and upset that she prefers spending time with that person than me in a daily basis (not sure is the same person thou).

The real problem for me is that this is daily. Some days she will shut down everything around 12am but she comes directly to sleep. It's more like she's tired or someone she really enjoys spending time with logged out early, of course I'm just speculating but it feels like that. When she's offline, she's also chatting with three of the guys over WhatsApp from time to time (I asked her).

I don't get to spend time with her all day except for meal time, and when I come back from work she's vanished upstairs with her friends until 12:30am or 12:00am. If I want to go to bed together I have to wait for her.

Weekends are similar, except she will spend before 6pm alone watching K-dramas or smth and will ask me to watch some anime or smth with her, 2-3 episodes, then game time from 5-6pm to 12:30am.

When I bring up to her that I'd like us to spend more time together she tells me ""we spend enough time together, we even work together"" and she questions me saying that she doesn't see what's so bad about her wanting to spend time with friends because it's something she enjoys and it's nothing bad, so why should she stop doing something that brings her joy.

It's driving me crazy that I don't know if I'm right in being upset or jealous or I'm just being selfish. I just wish she was a bit proactive in sharing some more quality time together but all I hear is ""this is what a normal relationship is like"" ""we can't do everything together, you need to find a hobby too"".

So, I'm here to ask whether I'm right feeling neglected or she's right that I'm overthinking it and this is what a normal relationship is like?

tl;dr wife spents over 20 hrs a week playing with male friends and with me it's just three meals a day of couple time + weekends. Am I right to feel neglected?",1,1739356842.0,marriageadvice,2,0.66,False

I am 24 yo, 177cm and 68-70kg, no sports or gym, smoking like 8-10 cigarettes a day, no alcohol at all, but I walk approx 10k steps a day, frequently doing some little body stretching when at work to keep the blood circulation good.

Still didn’t find any patterns of getting this pain (for example bad or less than avg sleep, coffee, more/less cigarettes etc). It starts in the morning and ends only when I go home in the evening and lay down for some time or fall asleep. Sometimes it is rare (like today, I am in pain right now for the first time in a month or more i suppose), sometimes it is frequent, like 3-4 days in a week.

1ino0w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Internal_Bike9635/comments/1ino0w5/how_to_design_a_cozy_and_elegant_living_room/,How to Design a Cozy and Elegant Living Room,"A [living room](https://decoireinterior.com/living-room-interior-design-in-hyderabad/) is so much more than just a room—it's your personal retreat after a busy day, a place to host friends, and a cozy spot to connect with family. To create a space that feels both warm and stylish, you need to think about how to combine comfort, elegance, and practicality. Each choice you make, from colors and materials to furniture and lighting, plays a significant role.

This guide will offer helpful advice on how to design a living room that feels welcoming, fashionable, and timeless.

1. Choosing Colors for Your [Living Room](https://decoireinterior.com/how-to-design-a-cozy-and-elegant-living-room-2/)

The colors you pick set the tone and feel of your living area. To strike a nice balance between coziness and style, think about:

Warm Neutrals for a Cozy Vibe:

Soft shades like beige, cream, and taupe create a welcoming environment.

Warm gray and greige blend classic looks with a modern twist.

Bright whites can lift the room while keeping it inviting.

Rich Colors for a Touch of Elegance:

Navy blue and charcoal gray bring depth and a hint of drama.

Emerald green and burgundy add a luxurious feel.

Soft earth tones like terracotta and olive create a natural warmth.

💡 Tip: Start with neutral shades and then add in richer colors to keep it both cozy and elegant.

2. Picking the Right Furniture: Where Comfort Meets Class

Finding the Right Sofa

The sofa is the centerpiece of your living room. Look for one that balances comfort, durability, and style.

Chesterfield sofas offer a classic and luxurious look.

Sectional sofas are great for larger areas and family gatherings.

Velvet sofas provide a cozy, yet lavish touch.

Mid-century modern sofas mix comfort with sleek design.

Coffee and Side Tables

A great coffee table ties everything together. Consider:

Marble or glass tops for a chic appearance.

Wood or rattan tables for a warm, rustic feel.

Gold or metallic elements for a hint of luxury.

Comfortable Accent Chairs

Including an armchair or lounge chair increases the comfort in your living room. Options might include:

Wingback chairs for a classic, cozy feel.

Bouclé or sherpa chairs for a soft touch.

Leather recliners that offer both luxury and comfort.

💡 Tip: Mix smoother surfaces like marble with soft, plush fabrics to create warmth.

3. Layering Textures for Warmth and Depth

A cozy living room shines with varied textures that add richness and depth.

Soft Furnishings:

Plush throws in cashmere, faux fur, or knits provide comfort.

Layered cushions can mix linen, velvet, and wool for contrast.

Area rugs can help define spaces with styles like Persian, jute, or shag.

Wall Textures:

Wood paneling offers a refined, classic appearance.

Exposed brick or stone walls add warmth and character.

Textured wallpaper can introduce subtle patterns for sophistication.

💡 Tip: Balance smooth surfaces with textured fabrics for a touch of elegance.

4. Mastering the Art of Lighting

The right lighting can transform your living room atmosphere. A combination of lighting works best:

1. General Lighting

Elegant chandeliers or pendant lights serve as stunning focal points.

Recessed lights provide soft, diffused lighting for a cozy glow.

2. Task Lighting

Table lamps with warm light create perfect reading spots.

Dimmable floor lamps help set various moods.

3. Accent Lighting

LED strip lights can be used to highlight shelves or art pieces.

Wall sconces can accentuate architectural features beautifully.

💡 Tip: Opt for warm LED bulbs (2700K-3000K) to create a cozy ambiance.

5. Adding Statement Decor

Mirrors for a Feeling of Space

A large decorative mirror can reflect natural light and make your room feel larger and brighter.

Artwork & Wall Decor

Consider large canvas paintings for a bold yet minimal touch.

Gallery walls filled with a mix of frames and art bring personality.

Hand-painted designs or murals can add unique flair.

Decorative Accessories

Gold or brass accents in lamps or sculptures add elegance.

Crystal or glass decor can enhance the refined look.

Books and designer coffee table pieces can elevate the overall style.

💡 Tip: Keep your decor minimal but carefully chosen—true elegance comes from thoughtful arrangements rather than clutter.

6. Designing a Functional Layout

Key Layout Tips for a Cozy and Stylish Living Room:

✅ Aim for symmetry and balance in your furniture arrangement.

✅ Create distinct zones using rugs or furniture placement.

✅ Arrange seating to facilitate conversation.

✅ Optimize space to avoid clutter and promote flow.

💡 Tip: Ensure at least 3 feet of walking space between furniture for an open feel.

7. Bringing Nature Inside: Plants & Greenery

Incorporating plants adds warmth and style to your space.

🌿 Best Indoor Plants for Your Living Room:

Fiddle Leaf Fig for a tall, striking presence.

Snake Plant and ZZ Plant for easy-to-care-for greenery.

Potted Olive Tree for a trendy touch of luxury.

💡 Tip: Use woven baskets or ceramic pots that complement your decor style.

Final Thoughts

Crafting a cozy and elegant living room takes care and planning—from selecting colors, furniture, and lighting to arranging your layout for both function and beauty.

She was a little shy when we brought he home at 12 weeks but we introduced her to our family and friends and she was great. We took her into a few shops and she was fine and we even took her to my friend’s coffee shop at a quiet time to get her used to the environment and she was fantastic. Everything seemed to go downhill after we took her to get groomed and after she became sick. After those incidents it was like a switch was flicked and we cannot walk past any strangers without her losing it. Barking, growling and lunging away and towards. 

We have worked with 2 trainers who have helped us change her routine, diet and enrichment but it’s been 2 months of this now and last night we have a terrible walk. We have been waiting until the evening when are less likely to see anyone and we only walk her up our road which is private so we don’t see any cars or people. However, on this occasion someone pulled into their drive and this really set her off, we tried all of our tricks to distract her and direct her attention back to us but none of them work and she went crazy. Then, on the way home a man walked down the road passed up and she absolutely lost it. She would not stop barking, even when he was gone. It’s so incredibly upsetting and panic inducing for me because I’m so worried about what the rest of our lives look like with her, I can barely get her out the door at the moment. 

I’ve been really strong for the since the reactivity started but last night properly broke me and I had my first big cry and panic about how we are going to tackle this. I’m going to speak to our vet at our next appointment to get a referral to a behaviourist so we can start getting her specialist treatment. I’ve also contacted the breeder and she hasn’t had anyone else from the litter come forward with this issue. I’m worried that this is all my fault and I’ve ruined this puppy somehow. I’ve been beating myself up everyday thinking about how we should’ve got a younger puppy, or done more with her or some things differently. I’m just absolutely heartbroken that it’s looking like I’m never going to be able to do the things with her that I dreamed about doing. Sitting at a lovely pub in the summer with her after a walk in the countryside, beach walks, taking her to friend’s bbq’s. 

Does anyone have any success stories for this kind of reactivity? I’ve done so much reading online and it all seems so doom and gloom. Right now I just need a spark of hope that things get better. If anyone has any advice or any success stories I would appreciate it immensely. ",6,1739356137.0,reactivedogs,6,0.8,False

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was picking up someone else's order from a coffee place. We're not supposed to say which one so let's just say it's that one. The one you think it was. THE one.

I go to pick it up and i get a request to take a photo of the receipt so i figure, no big deal, let me ask for one. So i ask for a receipt, the lady tells me they dont do that. Under no circumstances do they print receipts... I say i dont get how that's possible, you have to give people proof of purchase, i can see the machine that prints them, are you telling me you can't figure out how to print one or what? She offers to call her store manager and let me talk to them.

Sound good. I say okay. She starts to dial and then looks up at me, smirks, says ""i'll make sure and tell him i did everything to try and talk to you"" i say ""i dont think you did, but lets go ahead and talk to the manager"" she starts trying to tell me how i'm wrong and she really tried very hard to impress upon me that she can't print a receipt, so i said ""Can you just go ahead and make the call? Right now it seems like you dont want me to talk to your manager."" and then she tells me to leave. I ask her why, she says i interrupted her. I try to tell her i didn't, she cuts me off, i restart and she cuts me off like three more times and i let her. She says she's calling the cops which honestly i'm thinking has got to be bullshit. I wont lie, i'm sweating a little by that point, this is all so out of left field and she could've just called the manager.

So the cops show up, they take statements from myself and her, they dont tell me what she said the problem was but i'm not in trouble or anything, they just impress on me that there's no legal standard for trespassing and if a company doesn't want your buisness they can call the cops to toss you out for no reason. It doesn't sit right with me.

Strap in folks. If you thought this would be simple you were wrong.

I get on the phone with the very large coffee companies CS department and after i explain the situation the girl says ""why dont you just go down there and try to talk to them?"" like.... are you TRYING to get me arrested? I pretty much say that and i get a district manager phone number and a case number via email. I call that number, leave a message, get a call back and he wants to hear my side so i tell him what happened. It takes about two months to hear back from this guy, at which point he tells me that because police were involved i'm banned for six months, he says his hands are tied which is nonsense. It seems to not matter that he can't come up with a good reason for my being asked to leave or for the cops being called and he directs me to the legal department of the very big coffee company if i had any further questions.

I had further questions. This ain't right, he knows it, she knew it. Anybody would know it. So i go back through the CS department by email with the same email i had already used, i tell them i'm looking for contact info for their legal dept per the direction of their district manager on last contact. They create a different CS ticket labeled ""anonymous anonymous"" and email me a boilerplate apology, i email back with the original case number and ask once again for their legal dept phone number. Instead they give me the CS phone number. Heres where things get weirder. The first person i speak to tells me my case number wont load, just a blank white screen. She offers to direct me to a supervisor. The whole time there's all kinds of background noise and as i speak with her she's doing ""yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, go on"" while i'm talking, i'm just trying to get details on if this is normal or if she knows what the issue is or if she can ask a co worker for help. The supervisor tries to tell me that i'm not allowed to contact their legal department without actually retaining a ""legal team"" which is just a straight up lie and then he transfers me to a manager who sounds a lot like the first person i spoke to. She tells me that they hadn't gotten any update after they'd give me the manager contact info. She refused to transfer me to another manager or to any other person on the CS team, so i gave her the full story on the recorded line, she offered me a 20$ gift card which i declined and then i hung up. I got an email from the QC department of the big coffee company with the legal teams phone number.

So, get ready for another level of weird. I started looking for legal advice, because if i'm doing this i dont want to go in blind, i post on a free legal advice board in my state and i post on reddit. The legal advice section is a ghost town and my post is eventually automatically removed with 0 replies. On reddit my post gets removed with the comment from a moderator ""Get outta' Miami lebowski"", later edited to ""Stay outta Miami"". I had no idea what that meant and had to find out it's a movie quote or something. I tried to follow up with the moderators to find out what rule i had broken by posting and they have not replied to date, three months later.

I wish there were some kind of happy ending i could add on here, but to date i'm still not allowed back at that particular location, they have not reached out to try and explain the situation or to make things right, and by all accounts i've been cut off from seeking legal advice and the only lawyers i reached out to who specialized in consumer law replied ""not my specialty""...  At this point i'm posting to vent more than anything. I've actually got a few more stories of a similar nature, but lets see how this lands first.",0,1739356124.0,CustomerService,6,0.5,False

- not a caffeine problem. I gave up most of my caffeine issues when I had severe chest pain a month or two ago (went to PCP and ER, nobody knows what it was). I only drink maybe a cup of coffee in the morning on occasion.
- I cannot wake up to alarms. It feels like my brain just isn't responding to them. I don't even register they're going off. Don't know if this is related?
- if I do the ritual, it's a 60% chance I'll be able to fall asleep.",1,1739355909.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Long story, but we have a 7 month old Sammy. He has lots of difficulties in life, having been diagnosed with psychogenic polydipsia as well as hyperactivity. Since we have had him, we've spent thousands on vet bills and training. He struggles enormeously with settling down. We give him kong toys, coffee chews, but he often requires contant attention. Sometimes, he goes into a frenzy and barks for 3 hours non-stop, even after we've gone through the checklist (food, water, toilet, walks). 

He also has separation anxiety and issues with walking (often he needs to be dragged). He is reactive to birds (likes to chase them) and to other dogs (he just wants friends). 

Our lives have changed quite significantly, and each day is spent trying to placate him. We take him out for half an hour in the morning, an hour at lunch time (12:30pm) and another hour after work (6pm). This basically tires him out enough so that he sleeps and we can achieve peace at home.

How long do you all have to take your Sammy out? Did anyone else have a similar experience with their puppy? We're both very miserable but understand we have now have a comittment and want to do our best for our boy.",2,1739355827.0,samoyeds,4,1.0,False

It’s painful to watch and I just beg someone please jist stops her even for a week😭",18,1739355827.0,EDRecoverySnark,2,0.95,False

Away from the city’s hustle, this cafe offered a peaceful retreat that felt like a hidden gem.

I managed to grab a lake view seat, and with barely much crowd (may be because I visited at an odd hour), I just sat back, sipped on my oat milk coffee, and enjoyed the calmness. 

Not sure if it’s always this quit, but if you’re looking for a place with great view and a good cup of coffee, this spot is worth checking out! ",1,1739355718.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False
