1iuxi5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iuxi5y/i_think_my_life_is_a_messnot_the_kind_of/,"I think my life is a mess—not the kind of catastrophe that topples empires, but the quiet, persistent kind…","I think my life is a mess—not the kind of catastrophe that topples empires, but the quiet, persistent kind. The kind that seeps into daily life, unnoticed at first, until one day, I wake up and realize I’ve been carrying it for years. 

It’s feel like… I’m in quicksand. I know I’m supposed to do something, but I just can’t bring myself to do anything.

I have walked the same path since the day I graduated—Procurement in a vast, relentless FMCG world. Not once have I called it my passion. I stumbled into it, found it too good to walk away from, and learned to love it in my own way. It has given me many things: the art of negotiation, the thrill of numbers, the discipline of standing my ground in a boardroom. More than that, it has allowed me to care for my family, to carve out a life in this city, to buy a home—though it came with a debt so heavy it sometimes feels like another shadow I carry.

But somewhere along the way, I lost myself. 
I have a certain fears. 

I have given so much of my time, my energy, my mind to my work that I have abandoned my own body. I have gained 20 kilograms in these years—not just in weight, but in exhaustion, in self-doubt, in the quiet guilt that creeps in when I look at my reflection and see someone I no longer recognize. I am proud of what I have achieved—promotions, awards, five salary increases in four years—but at what cost? My body, my health, my sense of balance?

Food became my solace, my escape, my only indulgence. Late-night snacks, coffee that fuels my mornings, milk tea that sweetens my evenings. Sugar and caffeine—my most reliable companions, yet the very chains that keep me bound. Without them, I fear I will collapse under the weight of my own fatigue.

And then, there is money.

A “good” salary by comparison, yet never enough to grant me the freedom I crave. The freedom to immerse myself in art, to pick up an instrument, to take a makeup masterclass, to step into a gym without feeling like I must weigh its cost against my future. Is it truly a matter of finances, or am I simply lost in the endless battle between time and priorities?

And love—oh, love.

I never thought I would be single for this long. Once, I carried my confidence like a banner. I come from a family with good genes, and I used to believe that beauty was one of my strengths. But now, I feel invisible. No one approaches me, and I wonder why. Then I realize: I have not moved either. I have not let my heart race for someone in a long time. I tell myself that independence is a crown I wear proudly, yet in quiet moments, loneliness lingers.

For the first time, all my friends are in relationships. I am not jealous—this is not about envy. It is the quiet drifting, the way their priorities shift, the way I no longer fit in their plans like I used to. They have someone who listens to their stories for hours, who shares their burdens, who understands them without words. And me? I wonder if there will ever be someone who sees me that way, who chooses me in the same way I long to choose them.

But even with all of this, I remind myself—I have enough.

I have a family who stands beside me, parents who are still strong, still here, still loving. I have a home in a city that is ruthless, expensive, and always moving. I have a job in an era where layoffs loom like storm clouds. I have friends who have stayed through the years.

And yet, it never feels like enough.

I want to escape this quiet chaos, to untangle this knot, to find my way back to myself—one step at a time. But I don't know how...",1,1740161520.0,Advice,0,0.99,False

Getting discouraged.,"Wondering if I am expecting too much weight loss from the changes I've made. I've tried to do relatively small changes as knowing myself, I won't stick long term to a major change.

I'm a 42yr old male. Started at 226lbs. 6ft2in. Just looking to lose about 20lbs. I travel and work on CNC machines so sometimes I'm at a customer all day on my feet moving around. Other days I may be driving back and forth for 6 of those hours and only working on my feet for 3.

My eating before:
Morning: coffee with cream and sugar..sometimes stop at McDonald's for bfast sandwich and a coke.

Lunch: fast food (Burger, fries, large coke) with a refill of coke to take for the road.

Dinner: whatever we have at home. Have 2 more cans of coke. Would also snack till right up to bedtime, sometimes eating as I'm walking upstairs to bed.(10ish).

*Hardly ever drank any water. Was always a soda.

------------------

Now (doing 16hr fast)
Morning: black coffee

Lunch: No food till at least 11am. Still fast food but do not refill coke and take with me

Dinner: whatever is at home. No massive meals. Limit of 1 soda. Stop eating at 7PM.

* Drink between 40-60oz of water throughout the day.



In 6 weeks, I've lost 5lbs but for the past 3, I've remained at 221. Even bouncing a few ounces higher. 

Now I know my lunches are not healthy and I get that.  But stopping eating 3hrs earlier at night and changing my morning to not take in any calories until 11, coupled with at least a 50% decrease in soda and a big increase in water, I was expecting at least a steady loss each week.

I almost feel like if what/how I was eating before (no limits) only resulted in adding on average 1lb a year, it's not worth it. As I take enjoyment in eating tasty food.

I am also doing very light workouts at home. I have a push ups app where I do 5 sets of push ups and am about to start assisted pull ups. And started doing some treadmill walking on an incline.

What say you? Do you think sticking it out longer and I'll start seeing some small losses again or do I really need to revamp my diet? 

 Back in my 20's I got really fit, dropped from 215 to 175. But that was working out and cardio everyday, taking in a strict 1800cal a day. But I don't, and honestly can't go back to that schedule / way of life.",1,1740161366.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

My doctor has suggested the LINX procedure as an option if the ulcer doesn't heal.

I've seen lots of posts of people discussing the triggers and causes of their gastritis, and I've noticed that I don't fit most of them. Alcohol and coffee have never been part of my diet, I don't smoke. I take NSAIDs very rarely, maybe five to ten pills a year. No spicy food, barely anything acid. But I was still diagnosed with mild chronic gastritis in 2021 and I'm currently experiencing a flare up that initially started in October last year.

Yes, stress is definitely contributing to it. But I've noticed that I definitely don't eat enough and haven't been for a long time (even before the diagnosis). I assume my latest flare up was caused by this as I went two days barely eating anything and only drinking stuff high in sugar. 

Has anyone ever heard of this? 

I'm a bit at a loss because if not eating enough has caused this, I'm worried about how I'm supposed to heal if I can barely eat anything given the symptoms. I'll be put on PPIs again next week (the last time was in late 2023).

1iux40d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1iux40d/a_very_late_bloomer/,A Very Late Bloomer,"No matter the weather, you’ll find me wrapped in layers—sweaters, jackets, anything that conceals. Tonight, it’s a denim jacket, oversized by at least three sizes, swallowing my frame, rendering me shapeless. That’s the intention. I want to be unremarkable. Unnoticed. Unseen.

It took the sharp observation of a stranger to make me question why. ""I know you’re hiding something,"" he said, not unkindly.

The truth is, I am.

I rewind the years and find myself at thirteen, caught in a body that changed without my consent. Over a single summer, my chest swelled, my hips widened, and suddenly, I was taller—noticeable. And men, even relatives, noticed too. Their lingering glances made me look away.

At a computer school inside an upscale mall, my mother, ever forward-thinking, enrolled me in a program to prepare me for the internet age. My male teacher welcomed me back with a hug, his hands resting a beat too long on the small of my back. When class ended, he invited me to the faculty room, promising I could play “Arthur” on the colored Mac while I waited for my ride. He patted his lap. ""Sit here,"" he said.

And I did.

As I played, his hand stroked my waist-length hair. ""Good girl,"" he murmured. I don’t remember how long I sat there, perched on the lap of a man old enough to be my father. But I remember what my little heart screamed: Run, C. Run.

But that’s the thing about father wounds—when your Papa leaves, you take whatever paternal love you can get, even when your body begs for rescue.

At seventeen, I walked to the jeepney stop, fresh from a shower, wearing a sky-blue shirt and flared jeans. I barely noticed the man on a bicycle trailing me until his words sliced through the air. I won’t type them here, but I’ll tell you this: he spoke of all the ways he planned to violate me.

I never wore that shirt again. I never wore sky blue again.

At thirty-three, I stopped for coffee to break up the monotony of a slow workday. The barista had always unsettled me, but that day, he made it explicit—something about how I gave him a hard-on every time I walked in. When I asked him to repeat himself, he backpedaled. ""I was talking about the ice,"" he said. I paid for my drink and never went back.

These are just three instances. There are countless more. In public transportation, in offices, in spaces where I should have been safe.

My mother, beautiful and elegant, spent years lamenting my appearance. She hated that I didn’t brush my hair to perfection, that I deliberately gained weight, that I swaddled myself in oversized clothes. To her, I was wasting my ""natural resources."" She never understood why. I never told her about the almost daily harassment.

For years, beauty felt like a curse. And men felt like a threat.

Even now, I fear them. I fear their gaze, their hands, their words. I fear what they might take. And so, I stay guarded—not just in clothing, but in intimacy. I keep my distance. I flinch at touch. I struggle to believe in softness, in safety, in the idea that a man could reach for me without wanting to ruin me.

Still, something is shifting.

In a few months, I reach a milestone year, closer to the middle of life than its beginning. And something about this realization makes me want to reclaim what I once buried.

I have started caring for my skin, fixing the thick hair my stylist raves about, strengthening the body that carries me through this world.

Still, old habits die hard. I post selfies on Reddit’s selfie sub, only to delete them minutes later. The impulse to retreat is still there, stitched into my muscle memory. But so is the longing to step forward.

Slowly, I take photos again. Of the eyes that allow me to see, to read, to witness. Of the mouth that lets me taste and speak. Of the parts of me meant only for someone who will stay.

My mother was right—I was a late bloomer. But time is ruthless, and beauty never lingers.

So I won’t waste another second hiding. The layers will slowly fall—not in surrender, but in defiance. Not to be seen, but to live.Because life is vanishing, and I intend to taste every last drop of it.

Mira looked at the shrunken husk that had once been her father. He lay in a hospital bed under layers of heavy blankets, slowly forgetting how to breathe. He let out a gasp. His frail ribcage heaved with rapid, shallow breaths. Then, for a long moment, there were no breaths at all, until another rattling gasp and heave escaped his chest. The chill autumn wind seemed to breathe with him through the cracks in the windowsill.

Next to the bed, Mira fidgeted on the hard wooden stool. The small bedroom was hot and stuffy; her pink sweater and gray slacks were damp with sweat. Her stomach churned at the thought that the smell of death would linger on her clothes, following her wherever she went. Her sparse lunch tried to lodge itself in her throat. Mira swallowed it back down.

She frowned at her younger sister Grace, who stood behind their father's balding head. At twenty-nine, Grace still looked like a teenager. Her blue hair, red t-shirt, purple pants, and black combat boots were more suitable for a punk show at a dive bar than for a deathbed vigil.

Their father's eyes opened wide. He scanned the room as if searching for something no one else could see. An old silver scar gleamed on the pale skin under his left eye. His mouth moved but no sound came out. Their father raised a trembling hand.

Grasping his cold hand, Mira pressed the back of it to her hot cheek. She leaned close to her father's face and said, “It's ok, Dad. You can let go now. I love you.” She looked at her sister. “Grace, tell him—”

“Cerebral net status,” Grace said out loud to her neural link. Her eyes scanned the data received by her retinal link. She then glanced at the array of microscanners and sensors hovering like a halo over her father's head. At a thought from Grace, her neural link sent a list of minor modifications to the halo. The faint blue glow turned red while it made the adjustments.

“For God's sake! Tell Dad he can go!” Mira said.

Grace raised her eyebrows and glanced down at her father with piercing blue eyes that matched his and Mira’s. “Stop holding on. It's your time, old man.” She turned to Mira. “How was that?”

“Grace—”

“What?”

Their father gasped one more time and then, nothing.

Mira and Grace held their breath.

The hospice nurse stepped forward and placed his gloved fingers on their father's neck. Then he put his stethoscope on their father’s chest. The silence seemed to last forever.

“He's gone,” he said.

Mira placed her father's limp hand on the bed. Tears pooled in her eyes. She covered her mouth to stifle a sob.

Grace said, “Download stats.” She scanned the readout. The corners of her mouth lifted. “Mira, I got them. It worked.”

Mira shook her head. “What? How much—”

Grace grinned. “Everything from the last thirty-five years!”

\#

Mira followed Grace into her office at Cerebri Corp. She stared at the spacious room and floor-to-ceiling windows as the soundproof door slid shut behind her. While Grace was on track to become CEO, Mira was one of Cerebri Corp's many faceless, voiceless accountants, destined to be forever hidden in a tiny basement cubicle.

She sat across from Grace and tried to ignore the chair as it automatically adjusted to her height and posture. Mira frowned at the walls instead; they shone a dull gray with muddy brown streaks. The luminescent coating was programmed to shimmer with a rainbow of colors that changed with the time of day, the emotions of the viewer, and myriad other factors. It was something Grace had developed when she was an undergrad. *I bet she never sees any ugly colors*, she thought.

“I skimmed the files to get an idea of what the cerebral net was able to download,” Grace said. Her eyes were bright, her skin radiant.

Mira stifled a sigh. Her eyes looked bruised and abused from two days spent crying and barely sleeping. The wall color shifted; red streaks infiltrated the brown. Her face felt hot. She took deep breaths until the red faded away. “He didn't want this. He didn't want us digging through his private li—”

“Everything was fucking private! I doubt even Mom knew him. That’s probably why she left.” Grace turned to her console. “How do you love someone you don't know?”

“I loved him,” Mira said.

“You loved an idea of him.”

Mira grimaced. “I knew him—”

“Then why are you here?”

“He's gone. I want you to leave him alone.” Mira choked back a sob.

Grace stiffened. “Dad was always alone. Both he and that house were so fucking cold. Especially after Evan died.” She drew in a long breath before whispering, “I have to know if he ever loved me.”

Mira felt her scratchy eyes fill with tears. “Oh, Grace—”

“If he didn't, I won't feel bad I didn't cry for the bastard.” Grace spun around to face Mira. “At his age, his childhood memories were too degraded to download, so we'll have to start in his early twenties when he was a scout in the war. That would’ve been just before The Desolation.”

Mira shuddered. She remembered her high school history teacher describing The Great Desolation as if she were reading the day's weather report. “At the end of the war, a doomsday device was detonated in Beratonia. When their shield dome unexpectedly vanished, our troops searched the entire country and found no one, living or dead. All signs of civilization had vanished without a trace. It's unknown to this day who did it or why.”

“I don't want to see that,” Mira said.

Grace continued, “I scanned for any specific events that could have been traumatic for him. We’ll start with those. Unfortunately, the Memento Vita project is still in the early stages. It can show us what Dad saw and heard, but not what he felt or thought.” She handed Mira a pair of wrap-around, thin-lensed glasses. “You really should get retinal and neural links, you know.”

“I didn’t even want the aural—”

“The glasses will act like a retinal link and auto-connect with your aural link. It might feel overwhelming. Just relax and remember, it’s not real. We're only along for the ride.”

*Patronizing as always*, Mira thought. She watched Grace recline in her chair and shut her eyes. Mira fumbled around for a button or lever; she let out a small yelp when the chair reclined on its own. Her aural link emitted a hum when she slid the glasses on. The lenses turned opaque.

At first, there was darkness and silence. And then...

Bright sunlight streamed through the bare trees. The wind whispered through the branches. Small tufts of scraggly brown grass dotted the dry forest floor.

The scout touched his watch. A holo of a compass and map with a blinking dot appeared above the screen. He dismissed it and walked until he came to a deep hollow. He slid down into it, sat on the ground with his back to a rotting log, and set down his pack. He pulled a tiny, military-issue pill box out of his pocket. The lid was labeled 'caffeine' in red letters. He popped a tablet into his mouth. After drinking some water from his canteen, the man leaned back and closed his eyes for several moments.

When he opened them, the pack was gone. He jumped up and peered out of the hollow. A soldier in enemy uniform sprinted away, clutching his pack.

The scout chased after him.

The enemy ran toward a pile of boulders that stood near an energy shield.

The scout lost sight of him. He pulled a small pistol from its holster and slowly advanced toward the boulders. Circling them, he found nothing. The soldier was gone.

“Fucking hell,” he whispered. He walked to the edge of the energy shield. The shimmering gray wall rose out of sight. The surface rippled like water when the wind touched it. Partially liquified remains of squirrels and birds littered the bare ground nearby. There were no openings in sight.

The scout moved away from the shield and squatted on the other side of the rocks. Popping another caffeine tablet, he stared at the yellow lichen that grew in circular patches over the craggy granite. One of the boulders winked out of existence for a second, as if he had blinked. Then the boulder flickered and reappeared.

The man moved closer. The stone quivered and vanished, revealing a tunnel. He tapped the light on his left shoulder. A red circle illuminated the tunnel entrance. He stuck his head inside. It was silent. Pistol in hand, he crawled inside on his hands and knees. He followed the tunnel as it sloped down and then up again. It ended at another boulder. When he touched it with the barrel of his gun, the rock vanished.

He peered out into a dim, gray world. His breath misted in the air. The dome of the energy shield hovered high overhead like a permanent cloud cover. Scattered nearby were dead trees and animal bones. The crumbling remains of a small village peeked through patchy fog.

Twenty feet ahead, the enemy soldier crouched. His back was to the scout. There were no other soldiers in sight.

Creeping closer, the scout raised his aphonic pistol and fired.

The soldier stiffened and collapsed. Red blood seeped from the hole in his chest

into the mud.

The scout turned the body over with his foot. The soldier was a boy, no more than thirteen years old. The dirty, threadbare uniform of a much larger man dwarfed his emaciated body. Clutched in his hand was a meal bar.

A whimper came from behind the scout. He turned.

Another young, thin boy stepped out of the bushes. As he walked toward the scout with filthy hands outstretched, blood bloomed from a hole in his throat.

Bullets whizzed past. The scout dove behind a boulder. The top of the rock exploded. A granite shard hit his left cheek.

Soldiers swarmed over the scout. They took his gun and knocked him to the ground. Someone kicked him in the ribs.

The scout curled up.

Laughter rang out. The soldiers rolled the scout onto his back and searched his pockets.

The scout stared at the energy shield above. Red streaks had diffused into the shimmering gray as if a painter had dipped a brush filled with vermillion pigment into murky water. The red seeped out of the sky, coloring the edges of his vision.

One soldier said, “Voster anta restret?”

The scout was silent.

“Voster anta restret?”

“Rot in hell, bastards.”

Another soldier pulled out a knife. He dug the tip into the scout's shoulder, pushing harder and harder.

The world turned crimson. It glowed brighter and brighter.

The scout screamed. Blinding white light filled his vision.

Everything went black.

The scout cracked open his eyes. Sunlight shone into them. He blinked and sat up with a groan. The fog had cleared.

The soldiers were gone. So was the dome.

The scout pulled himself to his knees and rose to his feet. Shading his eyes, he scanned the horizon. The village was gone. There was nothing but brown mud dotted with puddles of red.

Mira ripped off her glasses. “What the hell was that?”

Grace sat up and opened her eyes. “The Bleeding Fields. Dad must have been there when the doomsday device went off.” She rubbed her face. “But how the fuck did he survive when nothing else did?”

Staring at the carpet, Mira felt her breakfast creep its way up her throat. She swallowed it back down. “I don't want to see anymore. That's obviously what made him—”

“Mom said he'd been tortured as a POW. That they'd cut out his tongue. We haven't seen that yet. We need to keep going.” Grace closed her eyes and leaned back.

Mira reached into her pocket and clutched a crumpled paper before she put on her glasses and followed Grace back in.

The scout tore off his sleeve and struggled to bandage his shoulder one-handed. He walked past the place where the village had been. The sun left its zenith and began its slow descent. A landscape of muck and red polka-dots remained unchanged until the scout came to a series of crimson ponds. He spun around and searched the horizon. A crow circling overhead was the only thing that moved.

He checked his map. The dot placed him in the center of a large city. He scanned the attached intelligence file. It noted a pre-war population of three million.

Red tinted the sky. The man sat on a rock and rubbed his face. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a small signal mirror, and held it up. His jaw glowed, turning the spatters of dirt and blood into black specks.

Footsteps squelched in the mud. The scout turned his head.

Soldiers wearing the same uniform as his surrounded him with aphonic pistols raised. Each man was tinged with red.

“Gre nata deta! Raise your hands!”

The scout glanced back at the mirror. His jaw blazed scarlet. He opened his mouth. White light poured out. He turned to the soldiers and yelled, “Run!”

There was a bright flash and then darkness. When the scout opened his eyes, the soldiers were gone.

With trembling hands, the scout held up the mirror again. His face looked normal. “What is this?” he whispered. He took a knife from his belt. He raised it to his throat. After several moments, he lowered it. Tears blurred his vision.

The man fell to his knees in the mud and jammed the mirror into a crack in the rock. “Why is this happening?” he screamed at his reflection.

The fringes of his vision filled with red. He opened his mouth. His tongue shined dazzling white. “No,” he whispered. The mirror disappeared in a puff of dust.

In one quick movement, the scout lifted his knife and swung it in front of his face. Blood splattered the rock. He watched his tongue splash into the red muck, its brilliant glow fading away.

Everything went black.

Mira and Grace sat up. They were silent for several minutes, each lost in her own thoughts.

Mira rolled her tongue around in her mouth to confirm it was still there; it throbbed where she must have bitten it. “We've seen enough. We have to stop!”

Grace shook her head. “There's another memory I need to see.” She picked up her coffee mug. Her hand trembled.

“Grace, please. I can't—”

“Then don't!” Grace slammed her mug on the desk. Cold coffee splashed onto her hand.

Mira flinched and said, “What memory?”

“The day Evan died.”

Mira blanched. Evan had been home sick that day, so Mom had taken the girls to school on her way to work. Dad was supposed to be home watching him. In the police statement, Dad had noted that he had run to the pharmacy around the corner to get medicine while Evan was sleeping. When he returned, Evan was dead. The police had ruled it an accidental death.

Grace leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes.

Taking deep breaths, Mira leaned back.

Evan lay in his bed with his eyes closed. His breaths were shallow and fast. His chubby cheeks were flushed red.

His father touched the watch on Evan's wrist. On the strap, the cartoon dog and boy wearing a white bear hat danced. The screen flashed a temperature of 102.5° F. The man walked to the adjoining bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet. A full bottle of children's cold medicine sat on the top shelf. He poured the orange goop into the small measuring cup and took it to the bedroom. He nudged Evan awake.

Evan opened his eyes. He groaned, trying to roll over.

His father helped the boy sit up and gestured that he take the medicine.

“Ewww, don’t want it,” Evan murmured.

The man sighed. He held the back of Evan’s head and pushed the cup to his lips.

“No!” Evan knocked it out of his hand. The cup hit the wall, splattering orange goop. The boy struggled against his father. His flushed face darkened. A faint light shone from between his clenched teeth.

His father jumped off the bed and stumbled back into the wall.

Evan whimpered. The light in his mouth grew brighter until his jaw glowed.

The man turned and ran down the hall to the storage closet. He dug in the drawers for a large pair of sewing shears. He grabbed them and dashed back to Evan's room. Before entering, he hid the shears behind his back.

Tears streamed down Evan's cheeks. His lips trembled.

His father brought his index finger to his lips and shook his head as he sat on the edge of the bed. The man grasped Evan's chin and pointed his mouth away from his face. He pulled the boy's mouth open with one hand. The other raised the shears.

Evan's eyes opened wide. His tongue moved as if he was about to speak.

His father flinched and ducked.

The boy wriggled out of his father's grasp, leaped out of bed, and ran into the hall.

His father chased Evan down the stairs.

Evan flew toward the back of the house. He dashed out the door and into the yard in his bare feet.

The man ran outside, scissors still clutched in his hand.

Wet brown maple leaves coated the yard and surface of the in-ground pool.

Evan sprinted alongside the water. He slid on a patch of leaves, pitched backward, and slammed his head against the concrete patio.

The man stopped. He stared at Evan.

Evan lay still.

He walked to the boy's side and knelt.

Evan’s eyes stared at the sky, unblinking. His breaths came in irregular gasps interspersed with long moments of nothing as if he couldn’t remember how to breathe. The boy's mouth lolled open. The glow of his tongue dimmed to an ember.

His father closed Evan's mouth. He brushed the boy’s bangs out of his eyes and caressed his cheek. He pushed the boy closer to the edge of the pool.

Then his father rolled Evan into the deep end.

Rippling waves sent a flurry of dead leaves sinking to the bottom.

The man stood and went into the house without a second glance. He put the shears away. He scrubbed the bedroom wall clean of orange goo and poured the remaining medicine down the drain.

The man went downstairs, put on his shoes and coat, and walked out the front door.

Mira pulled off her glasses. Her chest felt tight. She clenched her jaw to hold back a scream.

Grace sat up, her face blank.

Neither woman moved or spoke for a long time.

Mira finally said, “What should we do?”

Grace blinked and shook her head. “About what?”

“Dad killed Evan.”

“I think Dad killed a lot more people than our little brother,” Grace said. She spoke to her console. “What was the population of Beratonia before the Desolation?”

A pleasant disembodied voice responded, “One-hundred and fifty-three million people.”

The glasses slipped from Mira's fingers. “You think Dad did that?”

“We saw it. He was the only one who survived.”

Mira slid her hand into her pocket. She clutched the paper. “No, he wouldn't—”

“It looked like Evan could do it, too, whatever it was.” Grace smirked. “It actually worked out for Dad. An accidental drowning is easier to explain than cutting out your kid's tongue.”

Mira glared at Grace. “Don’t tell me you approve of what he did.”

Grace shrugged. “Do you still love him after what you've seen?”

“I... I don't know. He was a monster.”

“He did what he had to do,” Grace said.

“He was supposed to protect his child, not kill him.” Mira’s tongue throbbed in time with the headache that pulsed behind her eyes. “Should we tell someone about Beratonia? The government or something?”

Grace snorted. “Christ, Mira. Think! We'd get hauled off to some secret lab and tested like guinea pigs. Do you want that?” She pointed to the dime-sized data crystal sitting on the transceiver pad of her console. “Thankfully, I only stored Dad’s memories locally. No one else at the company has access.”

The walls swirled a sickly yellow-green. Mira's stomach heaved. She slipped to her knees, grabbed the trash can, and vomited up her breakfast.

Grace's eyes softened. She handed Mira a bottle of water. “You ok?”

“Of course, I'm not ok.” Mira's stomach heaved again. She reached into her pocket for a tissue. A piece of paper fell out.

“What's that?” Grace asked.

“Nothing!” Mira reached for it.

Grace lunged and snatched up the paper. “This is Dad's handwriting. Where did you get it?”

“It was in the safe with his will. It didn't make sense until now.”

Grace read it out loud.

“To Mira and Grace, I caused The Desolation. I spent years searching for the reason I was cursed with this terrible power. When I didn't find one, I wanted to die. Then you girls and Evan were born, and you gave me a reason to live. But I passed my curse on to Evan, and maybe to you, too. I should have killed all of us when I realized. I was a coward. Do what needs to be done. Kill yourselves before it’s too late.

“Let this evil end with us.”

The letter slid from Grace's fingers onto the floor. “He passed it on to us...” She pulled a bottle of vodka out of a desk drawer, poured some into her cup, and took a gulp. The mix of leftover coffee and vodka made her grimace. “I guess all of this explains why he chose sign language over a neural link and voice generator.”

Mira shoved the paper back into her pocket. “So what do we do now?”

“Get drunk for starters. The fuck if I know after that.” Grace picked up what looked like a silver pen off the workbench next to her desk. “We could use this laser cutter to remove our tongues. Or slit our throats.”

Holding up the bottle, Grace said, “Drink up, my dear, cursed sister. It could've been worse. At least we don't have children.”

Mira's lips quivered. Her hand went to her stomach.

Grace's eyes widened. “Oh, my God. Tell me it's not true!”

Mira wrapped her arms around her abdomen and didn't respond.

Grace began to laugh hysterically. When she got herself under control again, she wiped her eyes and said, “You always make the worst fucking life choices. I don't understand how we're related.” She took a swig of vodka straight from the bottle. “You know you have to get rid of it.”

Mira glared at the walls. Red threaded into the murky yellow-green.

“Mira, did you hear me? You can't have this baby. It's too dangerous.”

“I won’t kill my child.”

Grace slammed the bottle on the desk. “Dad wiped out an entire country by accident. What happens if your child has a temper tantrum? They might destroy the whole world!”

The walls turned a deep crimson that pulsed in time with the pain in Mira's head and tongue. “I’m not like Dad!”

“You’re right, you’re not like Dad! He did what he had to do.”

Crimson seeped into the edges of Mira's vision. “I'll go somewhere far away. You'll never see me again. If you destroy the memory files—”

“Are you crazy?”

“Please, Grace. I've never asked you for anything. Just let me—”

“If you don't have an abortion, I'll send the files to the news outlets,” Grace said.

“You can't! They'll figure out who Dad is. They'll take my baby and you and I will end up prisoners in some secret lab like you said.”

“That thing will cause another Desolation,” Grace said.

“That thing is your nephew or niece,” Mira said quietly.

“Who could kill every creature on Earth!”

Mira stood and said, “I won't let that happen. Erase the files.”

Grace smiled. It failed to reach her eyes. “I'll erase the files once you’ve erased that abomination.”

Mira blinked. The whole world was painted red. Her tongue burned like she was sucking on a hot coal.

“Mira, your face!” Grace jumped up and backed away. “Don't say anything!”

Mira slapped both hands over her mouth. Her body trembled.

“Shit! Shit! Shit! Try to stay calm, ok?” Grace grabbed the laser cutter. “I can remove your tongue with this. It’ll cauterize the wound so you don't bleed out.”

Mira’s eyes widened. She shook her head and stepped back.

Grace took a step toward her. She spoke in a quiet, soothing voice. “We have to, Mira.”

Mira moved one hand from her mouth to her stomach.

“We’ll worry about that later. Right now, let's do what we have to do.” Grace took another step toward Mira. And another.

Mira ducked her head and shook it harder.

“Don’t be stupid! It’s not like you ever had anything to say anyway!” Grace snapped.

Mira's head jerked up.

The sisters glared at one another.

Finally, Mira nodded. She stopped trembling as her hand fell away from her mouth.

Grace lifted the laser. “This will hurt. I'm sorry.”

Mira caressed Grace’s cheek. Then she took a big step back and closed her eyes. “Me too,” she whispered.

There was a blinding flash. When Mira opened her eyes, Grace was gone. A pool of blood seeped into the green carpet, turning it a muddy brown.

She wiped the tears from her face with the heels of her hands. She kept her breathing slow and even until the pain in her mouth faded away. “I had plenty to say. You just never listened,” Mira whispered.

She went to Grace’s desk and grabbed the data crystal. She dropped it on the floor and ground the heel of her shoe into it. Once she was certain it was pulverized, she threw back her head and yelled, “THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO!”

Mira felt a tiny flutter in her stomach. She placed a hand over it. The shimmering walls glowed the golden yellow of a sun-dappled afternoon as she walked out of the office without looking back.",1,1740160436.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Sometimes with suddenly getting up, sometimes upon waking in the morning I can literally feel the thudding beginning but again may be the effects of waking up and having coffee/nicotine. I have also noticed what looks like some nail clubbing possible? My sister pointed it out as well to me. I do have an anxiety disorder where I pick at my nails too however so that could also be causing the shitty state of them. Another weird thing that has happened in the past year or so, my nail color is beginning to look like terry nails where they go half red/half white. My ankles seem to swell up some in the summertime now with high temperature, and both of my feet swelled up really bad when I went to Italy on my honeymoon, they didn't go down 100% until I got out of there, I also decided it would be fun to go hiking as well during that trip. The swelling would go down like a little bit, then as soon as I'd go back out walking, they would re swell until I got back from my honeymoon. Lastly, I have been getting horrible histamine reactions for the past 1-2 years ever since my last covid booster. Sometimes my chin will start burning and if i even dare touch my chin it gets way hotter and worse. I can sometimes get this on my scalp, or feet. My face also gets very red on both cheeks and the area under my nose, except the redness never 100% goes away.  It seems to be sparing my lip area which remains always white. My skin seems to get worse as well as my histamine seems to get worse around my menstruation. I do also have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris, which affects my legs, arms, my back shoulders so far. Any insight would be great. I also get where the skin on my arms and legs will randomly itch and sting like I get bit by a bug but nothing is there. Maybe just redness and itching but that's all.

1iuwzdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iuwzdf/a_letter_i_wont_send/,A Letter I won't send,"Dear \_\_\_\_  
  
Now that enough time has passed, I want to tell you what I’ve learned and reflected upon in the months since. 

Your love never left me. I felt your absence every single day. I felt it in every morning, in every coffee, in every social interaction, and in every breath. Despite the difficulty, I continued living my life without you. I committed to sobriety, losing weight, and going to therapy. I often had a lingering sense of regret that I wasn’t able to commit to this for the benefit our relationship while we still had it. 

The love we had was beautiful, special, and raw, and it changed my life. It was ours, and it will continue to be even if time passes and our feelings towards each other and the relationship change. I also know that our love could be difficult and painful. I now believe that whenever we argued, both of us just wanted to be seen and acknowledged, but we were two different souls learning how to love and understand each other. 

Somehow, somewhere along the way, when one of us expressed how we felt and the other tried to understand, the message got lost in translation. For me, when I listened, I could only hear how inadequate I was and how I had to change. I always saw it as an argument and responded accordingly, instead of seeing it as an invitation to show me how my actions hurt you. I won’t justify my actions by blaming the insecurities from my past, the way you brought up these issues, or the emotions I had. I wasn’t the person you needed me to be, and I’m sorry. I could have changed, listened, and acknowledged you, but I didn’t. 

I also want to apologize for how I treated you during and after the relationship ended. While I’ve forgiven myself, I still want to express how sorry I am for my actions and their consequences. I wasn’t honest with you or with myself, I took you for granted, and I put my comfort, my happiness, and my fears before your needs. I continued to do this even after we broke up by not respecting your boundary of no contact. It was a difficult transition, and I’m sorry for the ways I tried to beg, bargain, guilt, or pressure you back into my life. 

In those moments, I didn’t understand why you left and how you could leave me with so little to hold onto. But I know that breakups are hard– it was both of our first. Although I held onto anger at the ways you ended the relationship, I’ve realized that you were doing what you felt was best for you and our relationship. 

In my healing journey, one of the most important lessons I learned was letting go of the illusion of control. I can’t rewrite the past or undo my mistakes. I can’t take back the ways I hurt you, even though I now understand why I did. And I can’t change how I behaved after we broke up. Every day, I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I can only acknowledge, forgive, and learn from these experiences. 

Similarly, I can’t change the way you acted. I can’t change the reality that you broke up with me or the way you did it. In the moment, and for months after, I wanted to keep trying and fix our mistakes, but you didn’t. All I can do is acknowledge the reality of our love– from the unexpected beginning to the painful end, for all of its beauty to all of its perfect imperfections. 

The final aspect I cannot control is the ending of our story. It might have already happened. We might walk our separate paths and slowly return to becoming strangers to each other– only this time, with a shared history of love. We might return to speaking terms once we’ve healed and be friendly with each other, though never once letting our defenses down again. We might try again and fail. We might grow old together and share our lives again.

I don’t know what will happen. This uncertainty is difficult to come to terms with, but it will teach me how to live in the moment. I have to learn to accept any outcome, no matter how painful or how much I want it to happen. While I wish I could send this to you (perhaps, to show you I’ve moved on in the hopes you come back), I write to the memory I have of you. 

Thank you for everything. I love you.

I am so angry at everything right now, I have worked every day of my life just to scrape by. My husband doesn’t earn a salary as he is a broker, so only gets commission when a deal is done. So to make up for shortfalls when there hasn’t been a deal he loaned money. This has added up since COVID and has turned into a huge amount of money owed to friends, family and the bank. 

Despite my attempts at trying to look for work that completely covers all of our bills, I always fall short because I do not have a degree and this is a minimum requirement for higher paid jobs. I am now freelancing because I can earn slightly more doing that than working for a salary, but now I have a client who can’t pay me for the work I have done, putting me further behind on my bills, and the deal my husband has been working on for the last year has fallen through, just another one in the line of many. 

My husband however, has a logistics degree but refuses to look at jobs in that industry because he hates the long hours and grunt work.

We have done everything we can to cut down all of our expenses… we are literally just surviving… and yet we still don’t have enough to get by… it is so heartbreaking as I now sit and think about what we are going to do with our house. 

Meanwhile, my husband has just gone on a company golf trip on a game reserve, our best friends have just returned from holiday in the Seychelles, our other close friends are also going away this weekend. Family members just bought another timeshare to add to their collection, and bought a second house that they are planning to flip and here I am just thinking about how nice it would be if I could have a coffee or how I am going to work out getting dinner on the table tonight and food in my child’s lunchbox. What makes me angry is how people complain about what a tough time they are going through, but have never experienced what we are going through.

And yet every day I pick myself up, do my jobs, clean the house, apply for new jobs, pack my daughters lunch & school bag, cook dinner, read my scripture, say my prayers, and on Sundays I even pick up my niece and nephew to take them with to church, despite the fact that nobody will come with me. 

I can’t remember the last time I went out for dinner, or just had a drink out. I do know the last time I had my hair done was for our wedding, and the last time I had my nails done was for my birthday 2 years ago, which I think is also around the time I bought myself an item of clothing… and it all may seem so very petty because I am not yet homeless and these are all material things… but I cannot keep on watching people around me thrive while I can’t get one nicety in my life.

I’m an indie dev and just launched my first app, it’s the notes app I’ve wanted and I thought I’d post here to let y’all know about it, as it can work with Obsidian.

[RIFT Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rift-notes-quick-note-to-self/id6739888423) (iPhone or iPad)

It’s called RIFT Notes, it’s for iPhone or iPad, and it lets you quickly capture notes like you would in a messaging app, think a ‘stack’ of notes. 

It supports markdown and if you grab the one-time ‘Powerpack’ purchase it’ll then sync all your notes/edits to your iCloud Drive which you can then open as a vault or use something like Hazel to copy into your main vault. 

It writes proper front matter and tags too. 

Completely private, your iCloud drive, no accounts to sign up for, no analytics, no trackers, no AI training, we respect your privacy.

Right now it’s a ‘1.0’ and the sync is 1-way, we’ll be working on 2-way sync in the future. 

Would love to hear feedback on it and suggestions as we build out our roadmap! 

And sorry Android friends, we’re a tiny company (2 people) and we made this app to learn about the Apple ecosystem so it relies on far too iOS native SDKs. If it gets popular we’d love to explore how to do Android properly, but we just don’t have the person-power to take that on at the moment.

I'm looking for a printer to replace ordering stickers. I mainly use 2.5"" full color circle stickers for coffee bags. At sticker mule, I've been ordering bulk rolls that ends up about $0.25/sticker. I'm wondering if I can drive down costs by printing my own, and if I invest in a nice printer, I can also print my coffee bag labels at home in full color (I currently use a black and white only Brother printer). This would enable me to make much more attractive full color labels. 

I know that one opinion is to simply continue buying from sticker vendors / commercial printers. However, the coffee labels end up with a lot more variation than the circle stickers and I'm sure I could cut costs by doing these at home in smaller quantities. 

Regardless, I'd love to know the difference between these two printers in general:  

# [Canon MegaTank PIXMA G3272 Wireless All-in-One Printer](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/megatank-pixma-g3272-wireless-all-in-one-printer)

This printer appears to have a higher print resolution, uses ink tanks, and the current similar model retails at about $180. 

# [Canon MegaTank MAXIFY GX6021 Wireless Home & Office All-in-One Printer](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/maxify-gx6021?color=Black&type=New)

This one has a lower resolution, appears to be more aimed at document printing rather than images or graphics, and yet retails at $450-$600 

Can anyone help me make sense of these two options or perhaps give me additional ideas? I've seen Epson EcoTanks recommended a lot, and have also seen a lot of negative things said about them compared to the Canon models. I will be printing typical documents as well, but not nearly as often as I'd be printing labels and stickers.

*   **Enhanced Brightness and Contrast:** Utilizing newer LED or laser light sources to ‌considerably​ boost brightness and contrast ratios, making the projector usable in brighter environments. A leap here is essential.
*   **Higher Resolution:** Jumping to‌ Full HD (1920x1080) or even 4K resolution would dramatically improve image quality and sharpness.
*  ‍ **Improved Battery Life:** Optimizing power consumption and integrating larger, more efficient batteries for ‌extended usage.*   **Advanced Connectivity:** Incorporating the latest Wi-Fi standards, Bluetooth 5.0, and USB-C ports for seamless connectivity with various devices.

1iuwg67,https://www.reddit.com/r/DressToImpressRoblox/comments/1iuwg67/how_to_get_more_stars_without_farming_or_cheating/,How to get more stars (without farming or cheating),"Obviously you can farm or use an alt account to vote for yourself. You can play with friends or in a private server. But other than those more obvious methods here are tips I’ve up along the way. 

1. Compliment other players. People who are in the chat hyping people up tend to get more stars. 

2. Vote generously. Servers with higher stars tend to encourage fair voting. When players see that stars are being given generously, they start voting generously as well. After a few rounds of voting everyone 5 (and complimenting other players) you will see a huge difference. 

3. Be able to laugh at yourself. Self deprecating humor goes a long way. I was in a server and the theme was “cats”… a player was in the chat saying “where is that dang cat tail?? (They couldn’t find it in time). When it was their turn on the runway they said “someone slammed my tail in the door and it fell off!” It was so cute and funny and they won. If something goes wrong with your outfit, invent a backstory and make it funny. 

4. Don’t be mean and don’t start drama but be willing to politely stand up for someone being bullied. Anytime I’ve seen a bully and told them to stop being mean I’ve noticed my stars go up. I would do this anyway but I’m just saying. 

5. When you’re first on the runway, it’s time to leave. Unless you’ve found an amazing server of course. But all things being equal, the first person on the runway is often at a disadvantage. Many players are pre-typing their runway messages, starring poses or just not quite playing attention yet because they went afk after finishing their fit. It’s also less likely to get 5 stars when you go first because people have nothing to compare it to yet. But the biggest reason you’ll get lower votes is because people who join the server mid-voting will only be able to vote for people at the end of the runway. So you’re at an automatic disadvantage. 

6. Be creative with your posing! Poses can make a good outfit great. If you have extra time before the round ends, test out some poses with your look and star your favorites. 

7. Be in character on the runway. I always tend to vote more stars when someone says something, especially if it’s “role play” - it shows effort and it elevates your look. Example: in the Karen theme you might say “where is your manager??? This coffee is hot and I said Iced!” 

8. Always say SOMETHING on the runway. If you can’t think of something funny or creative just say something. I tend to give an extra star when someone comes out and the compliment they were giving the last person is still floating above their head.

Mostly just someone who doesn't expect letters to come in asap and every two weeks or so (not enough stuff to write about if thats the timeframe). In writing I have a tendency to write a lot (ie yapping) because I like writing with my fountain pen so much. 

I think chatting with a stranger from a very different culture/ background could be fun!! I recently moved to the capital so I'm in a new place with few friends so- 

I was also thinking of doing some **fun things/ activities with my future penpal**.  *Things like sharing recipes we find, drawing, excerpts from idk funny or interesting media or journal entries, writing a story together, sharing some pretty photos of the snow here right now (i love drawing).* 

Oh, right, I almost forgot. I have to name some of **my characteristics and hobbies?** Uhm. I think I have a mind that can get interested in anything. Had some phases with music, writing, science, c and kdrama, different mythology (i had latin in school), webtoons, trying to get into some light philosophy, light gardening. I also have travelled to a few countries before (had a year abroad in murica). Most recently my hobbies are still drawing and translating songs from other languages to english so I can sing them karaoke style (like jellyfish by huh yunjin). And I am in uni rn. ( I also have a better writing style in text, I swear, I just tend to write like this if im online)

Will note though, some commonplace knowledge I lack like sports, certain world history that wasn't covered in high school, coffee or something. Am willing to listen to anyone defend those things!

Quick disclaimer: I am by no means a subliminal expert or pro manifesto and this is my individual, ongoing experience, so obviously not everything I write here may apply to everyone. However, if it helps even one person I am glad!

If you do not want to read this big fat writeup, scroll to the bottom for the key takeaways.

I was active in law of attraction type communities years ago beginning at about age 14. A couple years after knowing about subliminals and listening sporadically, I decided to try them for things such as clear skin and a better overall life...and I had no success, unfortunately.

I remember wondering wtf I was doing wrong after reading all the comments about people who claimed to have gotten results in anywhere from days to a few months. I often felt good while listening, but nothing ever happened beyond temporarily making me feel better about my acne-covered skin and stressful life situation.

Still, I stubbornly believed in them and kept trying various YouTube subs every so often over the years. With not an ounce of success 💀

With one exception: I did use a theta waves/lucid dreaming outside of YouTube from Brain Sync for meditating before bed that I still use every so often because it is so relaxing. And yes, it did help me lucid dream a little more during a lucid dreaming dry spell.

Now that you know about my miserable failures, I’ll list some of my successes.

**Garebear**

After several years of not using any other subs, I suddenly remembered out of the blue that subliminals in fact exist and searched them up on YouTube. One of the first creators I found was Garebear. I liked her style and selected a bunch of her subs to listen to, topics including clear skin, overall beauty, shopping assistant, thicker, healthier hair, and for fun, feline eyes.

My acne had calmed down over the years, but I was still getting breakouts on my cheeks, jawline, and especially my chin at least once a month.

In the beginning, I only listened to the skin-related and overall beauty subs. I felt my face tingling when listening to clear skin subs, my favorite being the one for permanent makeup. While I was excited about this, since I’d never felt my face tingle before, I didn’t have super high expectations due to past experiences. Plus, I feel like as an adult, I was no longer as serious and anxious about whether subliminals worked or not so I just had fun listening.

Two weeks into listening, I was looking in the mirror after my shower, and caught sight of my eyelashes and thought WTF because they were obviously longer. The difference wasn’t insane, but I used to have super short, straight eyelashes, and now they were obviously curved upward and denser. I was confused af at first, but quickly realized that the subliminals must have had something to do with it.

Sure enough, I checked the affirmations, and the permanent makeup one including an aff for long, thick eyelashes. I am pretty indifferent about eyelashes, so I was okay with it despite not intending to change them. Shortly after that, I noticed my cheeks looked overall smoother and lips more brightly colored. My faithful, 1-2 times monthly chin breakouts abruptly stopped. Other people commented on these changes, so I know it wasn’t just wishful thinking. For some reason, only my literal face cleared up. My jawline and back still got some pimples. While my results weren’t perfect, they were substantial and the first time clear skin subs ever worked for me at all. The effects did go diminish a year after I stopped listening (except the curved eyelashes, and chin breakouts only happen once or twice a year now rather than monthly.)

The shopping assistant sub results were insane. Everything I wanted online or in person was on sale when I went to buy it. I was given free coffees 3 days in a row by different people and least once or twice per week after that. I bought coffees often, and before that, I only got a free one once or twice a year.

Feline eyes (which I didn’t even listen to for more than a couple months) changed my eye shape a bit, making the outer corners more upturned. This was more experimental than anything, so I wasn’t that attached to the results. While I liked how my eyes looked, I also thought it might have been placebo since my eyes aren’t exaggeratedly feline (just that the outer corners are a bit higher than the inner corners) until I was complimented twice in a short period about my ‘cat’s eyes’ months after I stopped listening to that particular sub.

I also had some hair thinning at my temples, possibly from stress. My baby hairs had also fallen out and stayed like that for a couple years. Within a week of listening to the thicker hair sub, hairs suddenly began sprouting in the thin patches and my baby hairs started to grow back! After only two weeks of listening, I stopped and my results were permanent. While I usually listen to subs longer, some really don’t need that long to work. I’ve had them work in anywhere from days to a few months.

Later drama aside, I fucking loved Garebear’s subs. They were/are something else. The way she wrote the affs really worked for my brain. I swear there was magic in them too- not witchcraft, per se; I know she said she didn’t practice any magic or add frequencies, but I feel like she may have unintentionally imbued her subs with self-confidence and positivity while making them. Because I’ve tried other subliminals worded and made in the same style as hers, and none of them worked nearly as well for me.

u/ItsaKid

Never has there ever been a booster like the Mother Of All Boosters made by u/ItsaKid. I got good results from his first MOAB, it made me feel more relaxed about subs. Even after my successes with Garebear’s subs, I still frequently had a feeling that I HAD to listen to subs, like I couldn’t achieve anything good without them, or irrational stuff like if I looped one even one time less usual, it wouldn’t work anymore.

My most extreme results came from MOAB 2, which I switched to when Kid released it. I also used the modules he outlined in the accompanying manual, which I think is a really good and creative manifestation method. Especially since he includes a module to get rid of side effects.

MOAB 2 only had one side effect for me, a tickly, irritated throat that lasted for about a week (I didn’t think to use the modules at first, I only started a couple weeks into listening. This is apparently a common purging side effect after reading other MOAB users’ experiences, which fascinates me. I know the mind and body are extremely interconnected and mental illness and stress can cause physical illness, so it makes sense that some physical symptoms may be experienced while directly tackling trauma and limiting beliefs through subliminal listening. I wish I was rich ( maybe it’s time to listen to a sub for that LOL), because I would LOVE to fund a study on the effects of subliminals like MOAB on the brain and body to find out precisely how/why side effects happen and what changes there may be in the brain and body as the positive effects take hold.

Anyway, here’s the most valuable, permanent result that MOAB 2 gave me: **I am no longer attached to subs. They are nothing more than a fun tool for me now. If every subliminal ever recorded vanished from the planet forever, I would just be slightly disappointed rather than devastated, because I no longer need them.**

After several months of MOAB 2, I took a break from subliminals because I just didn’t feel like focusing on specific topics.

Now, I am listening to the new version of MOAB 1 and might switch to MOAB 2 again after a few months.

**Note on detachment and desires:**

Not saying that physical changes are wrong by any means, but say you are hyper-attached to physical change subliminals and feel lost and panicked if a creator’s video gets deleted from Youtube. Think about it. You probably don’t want big lips, super specifically shaped eyes, buccal fat removal, expressionless botox-esque face, a tiny nose, and a fatless waist because you ‘love yourself’. It’s because you bought into the idea that you need to be yet another Kardashian clone in order to be lovable (seriously, who tf decided that the Kardashians of all people are ‘the’ beauty standard for women in the west? That all women need to look like reality tv stars with plastic surgery?? It’s honestly pretty ridiculous when you think about it)

Or the male version, where apparently no one will every love or respect you if you aren’t 666: over six feet tall, have at least six pack abs, and make at least six figures. You don’t need the number of the beast to enjoy life 💀 💀 💀

Again, not saying physical changes are wrong per se, just think about why you want them. If they aren’t a fun experiment, they’re not worth it imo. If subs in any way frustrate you are make you anxious, you should listen to a sub like MOAB and spend more time relaxing, enjoying, and living your life than listening to AI voices overlaid with rain sounds and pop songs about pining over your ex.

I think if you can listen to 100 subs on miniscule body changes and have fun with it, you are better off than a person who anxiously listens to subs on a single physical change and panics if said subs one day vanish.

**Me**

My subs have been both massive fails and massive successes at the same time. Let me explain.

Since Garebear worked so well for me, I made multiple first person aff subliminals with Kinemaster the way she showed in a tutorial. I did my best to word them in a way that I thought might work for me and listened for four months consistently. None of them worked except one 💀 So much for the idea of your own subs being better than random YouTube subs, or so I thought at the time.

The only one that fully worked at the time was about an ideal relationship. I made lots of specifications in that one. I was single at the time and not actively dating. I kind of wanted a good relationship, but I was also okay with being single, so that’s probably why it worked. I met someone who fit all the specifications I wrote into it. Funny enough, before I knew any better, I had written a list of traits I wanted in a significant other years before, but I made the mistake of not including some important ones and including one where I mentioned something that wouldn’t be ideal, but I would still be okay with it (I thought at the time I had to settle in some way, because anything else was too good to be true, smh) Sure enough, I was in a relationship with someone for years who met the traits I wrote down...including the one that wasn’t ideal💀💀 Now I know better than to settle in any way.

Another subliminal I made about random, ideal life stuff mostly failed (everything I was worried about, super emotionally attached to didn’t manifest). However, an aff I included for fun was to see and hear wolves more often. I was living at the edge of a forest but still within town and I missed hearing wolves howling when I lived out in the country. Within a couple weeks, I heard them howling out in the forest for the first time in about three years. I heard them more often after that. Sure, maybe it was a coincidence, but it was awfully specific and matched the time-frame most subs start to work for me on average (2 weeks and onward.)

Maybe I’ll make a separate post sometime, since this one is pretty long. But long story short, I realized that when it comes to writing subliminals on my own, second person is superior. I made a very specific subliminal in second person, and everything I wrote in it manifested into my life! I only listened to it 2-3x per day most days. Maybe I’ll make another post sometime explaining that one, since this one is too long already.

I have yet to make another sub of my own since, but at least I know now to use second person affirmations.

**Slade**

Slade has indeed slayed. Their subliminals are amazing for me. Each one is extremely high quality and intricately made. I have all my favs downloaded in wav format and I’ll probably listen to them forever. I’ve never found any other subs aside from MOAB that so thoroughly improve my spiritual life and mental state as these do. I’ve been listening for some time now with a few breaks here and there, and every time I’m listening, I am able to leave my body every so often when I sleep, which is something I am very interested in, but very bad at actually accomplishing.

Another strange, interesting thing that happens if I listen to my long playlist with dozens of Slade’s subs consistently, is that I find way more bird feathers than usual on the ground. Not randomly once or twice, but new ones every single time I am out and about. Just single feathers from natural shedding.

I am not very superstitious and don’t believe in seeing signs through random events, but this has happened so consistently that I really wonder how tf it happens and what it might mean, other than that I’m on the right track with my inner/creative/spiritual life.

**Psyche (as of one week)**

I rarely visit this community for reasons, but when I checked back in recently, I saw all the raving about Psyche, so I checked her channel, liked her style, and started listening to some of her subs about a week ago.

It’s too early to say much about most of them, but I am listening to her artist sub, and HOLY SHIT has making art ever become easier. Despite loving art, I feel like I struggle with frustration at my lack of skill and a generally poor attitude in regards to drawing, but now I am abruptly creating drawings like it’s nothing. I’ve listened to a few other art subs in the past and none of them have ever had such a marked effect on me.

I am excited to see where I will be at in a few months!

**Methods that worked:**

Second person affirmations: For me, second person affirmations > first person. With few exceptions like Garebear, first person affirmations seem to make my brain think I’m just delusional. Like, why does this crazy btch think she has money in her account when she obviously doesn’t lol

Except for topics that I am detached towards, first person is a no go. Second person, however, seems to make my brain believe that someone is complimenting me or making an observation, therefore proving that the affirmations are real.

Stacking, as long as the subliminals don't contain frequencies that shouldn't be stacked, works well. It speeds up results slightly in my experience.

After years of relatively unsuccessful attempts to practice manifestation as a teenager, I became uncertain that it’s possible to influence your life through subliminals in a more non-physical way (like manifesting money without applying to jobs, for instance.) Now, I am not so certain. While I still don’t believe literally ‘anything’ is possible (like sprouting a third arm between your shoulder blades, for example, although if you can do that, I would like to see), I do think more things are achievable than I previously thought thanks to subs.

**TLDR (essential tips): (I am going to scream them at you, sorry not sorry)**

IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF YOUTUBE SUBS, MAKE YOUR OWN! STOP BLAMING CREATORS EVERY TIME AN INEVITABLE NEGATIVE LIFE EVENT OCCURS! (Like your 90-year-old grandma probably didn’t die because of Moza Morph, but rather because she reached the end of her natural life.)

SUBLIMINALS ARE VALUABLE TOOLS, BUT THEY ARE JUST THAT: TOOLS. THEY ARE NOT A PREREQUISITE TO LIVING LIFE.

NOT ALL CREATORS AFFIRMATION STYLES WORK FOR EVERYONE. IF ONE CREATOR’S SUBS DON’T WORK AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF CONSISTENT LISTENING, TRY ANOTHER.

EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT AFF STYLES. FIRST PERSON (I, ME, MY), SECOND PERSON (YOU, YOUR, YOU’RE). TRY STRAIGHT TO THE POINT- STYLE AFFS, COMPLIMENTS, STORYTELLING, EXAGGERATING, ETC. TRY A BUNCH TO FIND OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU.

LISTENING TO THE EXACT SAME SUBLIMINALS IS UNNECESSARY IF YOU FIND THAT BORING. LISTENING TO A VARIETY OF SUBLIMINALS EACH DAY ON THE SAME TOPIC WORKS JUST AS WELL.

STICKING TO ONE TOPIC VS. LISTENING TO A LARGE PLAYLIST CONTAINING MULTIPLE TOPICS WORKS EQUALLY WELL AS LONG AS YOU ARE CONSISTENT.

CONSISTENCY MATTERS! LISTENING TO A SUBLIMINAL 2X A DAY FOR THREE DAYS PER WEEK LONG-TERM IS BETTER THAN LISTENING 24 HOURS PER DAY FOR A WEEK AND THEN GIVING UP FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

IF YOU LIKE LISTENING TO SUBS WHILE MEDITATING/VISUALIZING, DO IT! IF YOU DON’T, JUST LISTEN WHILE DOING SOMETHING ELSE (GAMING, WATCHING A MOVIE, STUDYING, READING, SLEEPING, ETC.) SO THAT YOU DON’T OVERTHINK IT.

LISTENING SHOULD BE FUN OR CASUAL. IF IT ISN’T, STOP LISTENING FFS AND DO SOMETHING YOU ACTUALLY LIKE (DRAW, CUDDLE YOUR CAT, HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, PAINT OFFENSIVE GRAFFITI ON YOUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE BUILDING, WHATEVER YOU ENJOY ) DON’T LET A STUPID VIDEO OR AUDIO FILE CONTROL YOUR LIFE AND STRESS YOU OUT FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!

IF YOU ARE INSECURE ABOUT VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF YOU EXISTENCE (BODY, FACE, LIFE, RELATIONSHIPS, ETC) YOU’D PROBABLY BENEFIT MORE FROM A SUBLIMINAL ABOUT SELF LOVE, TRAUMA HEALING, AND HAPPINESS RATHER THAN 9,395,398 SUBS ABOUT CHANGING EVERY CELL OF YOUR BODY AND EACH ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.

**Why This Pick?**

As all of the NBA teams shake off the rust that they seem to have acquired over the break, one thing seems to be fairly consistent: and it’s that all of these guys are playing to totals 10-15 points lower than they typically would. I’m rolling with this pick because before the break, Toronto cashed the Under in 2 of its last 3 outings, while Miami cashed it in 4 of its last 5…and now I imagine a universe where they play to 10 points even lower than that! Looking at some recent numbers, the Raptors haven’t put more than 109 points on the board in their last 5 straight games, and the Heat have only made it as high as 113 points once in their last 5. Lastly, these squads hit a total of 218 in their last meeting – I’ll be surprised if it gets anywhere near that today. My money is on the Under to hit, friends.

If anyone is in an unhealthy relationship and find its draining you emotionally or testing your limits way too often, the brain shots are there for you.  I am sure there are infinite applications for any situation but this is what I've been dealing with personally.  I've been harboring a lot of guilt and shame for no fault of my own.   2 days on the guilt and shame shifter and the amount of energy that came over me was so great that I was ready to do what I had to do to bring about change in that relationship.  After many years boundaries have been set, and up until then I felt powerless to do anything.

I heard AW say in a live they work using frequencies.  I think the frequencies of emotions is worth looking in to as harmonizing emotional frequencies seems to be how the stabilizers and shifters work.  I believe this is the miracle.

1iuw2kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/humandesign/comments/1iuw2kc/lurking_around_as_a_projector/,Lurking around as a Projector,"I'm a 4/6 Self-Projected Projector (36F) and I'm in a bit of a rut because I left my job a few years ago due to burnout (I know, standard Projector on the roof stuff), and when I wasn't going through deconditioning hell, I was writing a fun novel. Now, the novel is ready and I've been trying to market it on social media for a few months but not only has it been unsuccessful but also very draining. So I need to delegate. But to be able to delegate, I need money, and to have money, I need a job.

In the past, getting a job was never an issue, because there was always some temp agency who would take me on and then send me places where I'd channel all my scarcity and desperation for survival into becoming a workhorse who mastered the system and got all the invitations I could ask for. 

But I cannot get myself to do that anymore. I just don't have that genuine fire in me. Just googling agencies and opportunities makes me want to hurl, so it's clear that I need a new approach.

So I've been contemplating (stressing) over this these past few weeks. Tthen last night I had a dream where I liked an office/company and kept going there with various excuses, e.g. acting like I was delivering a package or just making coffee like I'm one of their clients. Just fluffing around. My intentions didn't feel dodgy, but I just kept finding reasons to be there. It was like a fascination and wish-fulfillment of belonging there. Then out of the blue, two managers invited me for coffee outside the premises, got to know me a little, and then offered me a position that was way out of my wheelhouse but they felt confident I could do it. I even pointed out something that I lacked, and they just made a joke out of it, like it didn't matter. And that was it, I was in.

Funnily enough, the part where I'm interviewed and I point out an experience I lacked, and the managers just swiped it under the rug has happened to me in real life. 

Then today I came across an archived post where another projector said that lurking around environments is a genuine proactive thing we can do in order to get an invitation. That is mind-boggling to me! But also hilarious! And the coincidence of it all makes me wonder if it is also a sign :)

Does anyone have any experience with this, please?

Projectors don't reach success by sitting back. It's more trickier than that... most succesful projectors were very proactive in their pursuit of better life.

1iuw1tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1iuw1tc/planet_hollywood_cancun_all_inclusive_with_star/,Planet Hollywood Cancun All Inclusive with Star Class upgrade,"TL;DR: good food and variety, good service, hike to the beach/ocean, hope you’re an early riser. What I’d expect from an all-inclusive but nothing mind blowing. 

Info: We spent a week here in mid February 2025. Transfer from the airport was done through JetBlue vacations which was a little difficult to find in the open air transport area but otherwise didn’t take long. Roughly 45 minutes from the Cancun airport. We had a Star class upgrade which has its own check-in desk and a separate cocktail bar which you can make your own drinks during check-in if you like. This is not an adults only all inclusive resort, there is a family side with a waterpark but our group was 18+ so we spent most of our time on the adults only side. Can’t say much about the family side except for what we saw during evening meals and entertainment. The layout of the resort is like a giant V with the main entertainment areas and all access restaurants at the point of the V and hotel rooms and pools along each arm of the V. The beach and ocean would be located at the ends of the arms. 

Room: King suite with a swim out. The patio does come with a personal cabana for 2 as well as 2 in-pool loungers. The swim-out pool is semi-private and is contiguous with the block of other swim-out rooms along the side but there are high walls that separate each as well as hedges that give privacy from other resort guests. Our room had a double vanity, large shower with a rainfall shower head and detachable shower handle. A small dehumidifier is provided in every room, which is appreciated, but it will be working overtime. We ended up having to empty the water out multiple times throughout the day and night to keep it going but the a/c works well. The decor is definitely old and could use an update but everything is kept pretty orderly and clean. There is a mini-fridge that was restocked everyday with bottled water, Pepsi products, Dos Equis and Coors Light. As part of the Star class upgrade you get a bottle of liquor for your room that is typical of what you’d find mid shelf at a bar (Grey Goose Vodka, Tanqueray Gin, Johnny Walker Double Black, etc). Additional bottles can be purchased for $40 if you’d like. Rooms are decently soundproofed to you’re not being blasted by the sound system at the pool or noisy neighbors if you’d want to take a midday nap in your room. 

Beach: The biggest gripe I have about the resort is the beach is a long hike in the sand from the rest of the resort. Our room was situated at the very end of the hotel closest to the beach but there’s still quite a hike through the sand and a long bridge to even reach the water. The sand is soft but can get rough and pebbly in the shallow water until you get out into the waves more. Ample seating and shade if desired. There’s a couple bars that are situated centrally that are within walking distance. Bar staff is very attentive and active so there isn’t much wait for drinks

Pool: We spent most of our days by the adult scene pool. There is a swim up bar that is always busy with barstools and benches in the water around the bar as well as walk up seats on land. Shade can be limited if you’re not looking to burn/tan. The pool is clean and stays comfortably cool throughout the day. You can bring your own floats to use if you like. You will definitely have to get up early if you want loungers at poolside or in the water. We would be getting breakfast at 0700 and towels were down on loungers nearly everywhere. 

Food/drink: Lots of variety in restaurants - Italian, sports bar with pub food, steakhouse, Indian, buffet, Japanese teppanyaki/hibachi, coffee cafe. There is also a Brazilian churrascaria and a seafood restaurant that are exclusive to the adult scene area. The food is good with a pretty wide selection of cuisine and dietary needs - gluten free options and vegan options looked to be available at every restaurant. Nothing Michelin star quality but it works. You will definitely need to make reservations at the theme restaurants unless you like eating at 2130. Walk-ins get lowest priority unless you’re a duo and they can seat you easily. If you’re a bigger group, you’ll definitely need to talk to staff to make a reservation. The buffet is standard fare with 3 omelette stations and a crepe area. During lunch around the adult scene pool, they will have a free standing grill where they’ll often serve tamales and fresh street style tacos. Drinks around the pool and beach are plentiful. Some bars will have exclusive cocktails but they’ll generally honor any requests if they have the ingredients. Dos Equis is the house beer. I will say that many of the cocktails don’t really taste of alcohol but that may be so they don’t have people toppling into the pool. Star class and adult side does have its own private lounge with an all access bar and pastries/snack bar. 

Entertainment/activities: There’s poolside activities aplenty. The entertainment staff tries to engage everyone pretty well and the younger age crowd contributes to some of the enthusiasm. We’ve done poolside bingo, water aerobics, a singing contest, and pool volleyball through our stay. Evening entertainment varies from live music to themed nights like Mexican Gran Fiesta and Michael Jackson Live. There are also some themed dinners that take place in the central theatre area but they are extra and are not included in the cost of your stay. The evening events are held in the central area around the main lobby so sound is pretty isolated to non living areas which makes it nice if you’d like to turn in early. 

Service: Star class upgrade does come with butler service. Juan and Mafer were great and would check in with us throughout the day to make sure we had what we needed including housekeeping if our room hadn’t been made up through the day or requests for the room and reservations for restaurants. Other staff are very attentive and will check on you throughout the day if you need a refresher on drinks or food. Shout out to Lily at poolside and Moses on the beach who both deserve all the praise and were tipped well everyday we had them. Service in the restaurants can be a little slow but I chalk that up to how busy every restaurant is rather than the staff slacking. 

Overall it’s not a romantic getaway but if you’re here with kids 18+ or if you’re just looking for an all inclusive that checks off all the typical all inclusive boxes, Planet Hollywood Cancun is a decent choice.",3,1740158037.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed seamlessly into your morning coffee without altering its taste or texture. Its unique blend of natural ingredients aims to synergize with coffee's inherent compounds, thereby enhancing metabolic processes and facilitating weight loss. The convenience of incorporating it into a daily routine has contributed to its popularity among individuals seeking effortless weight management solutions.

**Key Ingredients**

Understanding the components of Java Burn is crucial to evaluating its potential effectiveness. The primary ingredients include:

* **Green Tea Extract**: Rich in catechins, particularly Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), green tea extract is renowned for its antioxidant properties and its role in boosting metabolism and fat oxidation.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract**: This extract contains chlorogenic acid, which may help reduce carbohydrate absorption in the gut, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote fat metabolism.
* **L-Theanine**: An amino acid found in tea leaves, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without drowsiness and can counteract the jittery effects of caffeine, leading to improved focus and mental clarity.
* **L-Carnitine**: This amino acid derivative plays a vital role in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production, potentially aiding in fat burning and enhancing exercise performance.
* **Chromium**: An essential trace mineral, chromium helps regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, supports blood sugar control, and may reduce cravings, thereby assisting in weight management.

**How Does Java Burn Work?**

Java Burn's formulation is designed to complement the natural effects of coffee. Caffeine, a well-known stimulant, enhances metabolic rate and increases fat burning. When combined with Java Burn's ingredients, the supplement aims to:

* **Boost Metabolism**: The synergistic effect of caffeine, green tea extract, and chlorogenic acid may elevate the body's resting metabolic rate, leading to increased calorie expenditure.
* **Enhance Fat Oxidation**: Ingredients like L-Carnitine facilitate the transport of fatty acids into cells for energy production, potentially increasing the rate at which fat is burned.
* **Improve Mental Focus**: The combination of caffeine and L-Theanine promotes alertness and concentration without the common side effects of overstimulation, such as jitters or anxiety.
* **Regulate Blood Sugar Levels**: Chromium and chlorogenic acid work together to stabilize blood glucose levels, which can help control appetite and reduce cravings.

**Benefits of Java Burn**

Users of Java Burn have reported several potential benefits, including:

* **Weight Loss Support**: Many users have experienced gradual weight loss, especially when Java Burn is combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise.
* **Increased Energy Levels**: The supplement provides a steady energy boost throughout the day, enhancing physical performance and reducing fatigue.
* **Enhanced Mental Clarity**: The calming yet alert state induced by L-Theanine and caffeine helps improve focus and cognitive function.
* **Convenience**: Its tasteless powder form allows for easy integration into daily coffee routines without altering flavor profiles.

**Potential Side Effects**

While Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients, some individuals may experience side effects, particularly those sensitive to caffeine. Potential side effects include:

* **Increased Heart Rate**: Caffeine-sensitive individuals might experience palpitations or elevated heart rates.
* **Digestive Discomfort**: Some users have reported bloating or stomach upset.
* **Sleep Disturbances**: Consuming caffeine later in the day can interfere with sleep patterns.

It's advisable to start with a smaller dose to assess tolerance and consult with a healthcare professional if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

**Pricing**

As of 2025, Java Burn is available for purchase through its official website, with pricing options as follows:

* **30-Day Supply**: One pouch priced at $69 plus shipping.
* **90-Day Supply**: Three pouches priced at $117, including shipping (equivalent to $39 per pouch).

**User Feedback**

Customer reviews of Java Burn have been mixed:

* **Positive Feedback**: Many users report increased energy levels, improved focus, and gradual weight loss. The convenience of adding it to their daily coffee is frequently highlighted as a significant advantage.
* **Negative Feedback**: Some users have not observed noticeable weight loss results and have mentioned experiencing mild digestive issues or alterations in coffee taste. A few also consider the product to be on the pricier side compared to other supplements.

No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling drained. I tried everything—energy drinks, coffee, and even expensive supplements—but nothing seemed to work. That’s when I stumbled upon Mitolyn and decided to give it a shot. After reading multiple Mitolyn reviews, I was hopeful but skeptical. Could this be the solution I had been looking for?

My Experience with Mitolyn  
When my bottle of Mitolyn arrived, I started taking it as directed. Within the first few days, I noticed a slight increase in my energy levels. I wasn’t crashing in the middle of the day like I used to. By the end of the second week, the changes were undeniable.

Increased Energy Levels – I felt more awake and alert throughout the day without relying on caffeine.

Improved Mental Clarity – Brain fog, which had plagued me for years, began to lift. My focus and productivity improved significantly.

Better Sleep Quality – Surprisingly, my sleep became more restful, and I woke up feeling refreshed.

Overall Well-being – I felt healthier, more active, and motivated to take on daily challenges.

Why Mitolyn Stands Out  
Reading through various Mitolyn reviews, I realized that I wasn’t alone in experiencing these positive changes. Many users reported similar results, which made me even more confident in its effectiveness. Unlike other energy-boosting supplements, Mitolyn works at the mitochondrial level, supporting natural energy production rather than providing a temporary boost. This makes it a game-changer for people dealing with chronic fatigue and low energy.

The Science Behind Mitolyn  
One of the things that impressed me the most about Mitolyn is the science behind it. Many energy supplements rely on caffeine or other stimulants to create a short-term boost in energy. While this can be effective for a few hours, it often leads to crashes and dependency. Mitolyn, on the other hand, focuses on enhancing mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell because they generate the energy needed for cellular functions. When mitochondrial function declines, so does overall energy production.

Mitolyn contains ingredients that support and optimize mitochondrial efficiency, helping the body produce sustained energy throughout the day. This explains why so many people experience long-term benefits rather than just a quick boost.

My Journey After One Month  
After using Mitolyn consistently for a month, I noticed even greater improvements in my overall well-being. My energy levels continued to rise, and I felt more resilient against daily stress. Here’s a breakdown of how my life changed:

Week 1: Small but noticeable improvements in energy levels. No major changes but a slight reduction in mid-day crashes.

Week 2: Brain fog lifted significantly. I could concentrate better at work and complete tasks more efficiently.

Week 3: My sleep improved drastically. I woke up feeling refreshed rather than groggy.

Week 4: My motivation and physical stamina increased. I even started exercising more regularly, something I had struggled with before.

Comparing Mitolyn to Other Supplements  
Before discovering Mitolyn, I had tried numerous other supplements, including vitamin B12, iron, and generic energy boosters. While some of these provided temporary relief, none offered the long-term benefits I experienced with Mitolyn. Many Mitolyn reviews mention similar experiences, where other products fail to deliver consistent results.

A key reason Mitolyn stands out is its holistic approach. Instead of merely masking symptoms, it addresses the root cause of fatigue by optimizing cellular energy production. This makes it a superior choice for anyone looking for a natural and sustainable energy solution.

The Pros and Cons of Mitolyn  
Like any supplement, Mitolyn has its pros and cons. While my experience has been overwhelmingly positive, I believe in providing a balanced review.

Cons:  
Results Take Time: Unlike stimulants that provide an immediate effect, Mitolyn requires consistent use for noticeable improvements.

Who Should Try Mitolyn?

Individuals suffering from chronic fatigue or low energy levels.

People dealing with brain fog and reduced cognitive function.

Anyone looking for a natural and long-term solution for better overall health.

Mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell because they generate the energy needed for cellular functions. When mitochondrial function declines, so does overall energy production.

Mitolyn contains ingredients that support and optimize mitochondrial efficiency, helping the body produce sustained energy throughout the day. This explains why so many people experience long-term benefits rather than just a quick boost.

My Journey After One Month  
After using Mitolyn consistently for a month, I noticed even greater improvements in my overall well-being. My energy levels continued to rise, and I felt more resilient against daily stress. Here’s a breakdown of how my life changed:

Week 1: Small but noticeable improvements in energy levels. No major changes but a slight reduction in mid-day crashes.

Week 2: Brain fog lifted significantly. I could concentrate better at work and complete tasks more efficiently.

Week 3: My sleep improved drastically. I woke up feeling refreshed rather than groggy.

Week 4: My motivation and physical stamina increased. I even started exercising more regularly, something I had struggled with before.

Comparing Mitolyn to Other Supplements  
Before discovering Mitolyn, I had tried numerous other supplements, including vitamin B12, iron, and generic energy boosters. While some of these provided temporary relief, none offered the long-term benefits I experienced with Mitolyn. Many Mitolyn reviews mention similar experiences, where other products fail to deliver consistent results.

A key reason Mitolyn stands out is its holistic approach. Instead of merely masking symptoms, it addresses the root cause of fatigue by optimizing cellular energy production. This makes it a superior choice for anyone looking for a natural and sustainable energy solution.

42/f here, so after 42 years is seems I’ve been “raw dogging” life with adhd.  My mind is blown. It makes so much sense. Over my life I have learned my own management and ways to cope planners, alarms etc and I guess masking all the hilarious and quirky things we do. It’s something I never even thought I did. I was speaking to my doctor about some struggles and the big long list of symptoms and she asked if I had ever considered I had adhd. At first I was like nahhh no way..  but after a couple days of reflection I realized…Ohhh shit.. I think this could be something.  Ffwd to a test and diagnosis now I’ve started on vyvanse (generic one) started on low dose and im trying to determine if its doing anything good for me….

And I think yes??  But I feel kind of weird in my body not euphoric or high but just…different. It’s only my third day taking them.  There must be an adjustment period.   It’s possibly coffee? Maybe tomorrow I’ll try no coffee in the morning. 

On my first day I managed to paint the upstairs and downstairs bathroom ceilings and walls two coats. Ive got some minor touch ups I’ve been meaning to do this for awhile but there has been new motivation to get things done (that’s a long story) so I would have been doing it anyways.  What I noticed is…I finished it. Except some minor touch ups today. Without a lot of side quests, phone pick ups, I had a break to eat and then back to it.  I also did laundry and detailed the shower in between dry time.  It was a perfectly reasonable use of my time. 
I feel pretty good and not all that different except the “body weirdness”.    And last night I freaking went to bed and wound down and slept!! I wasn’t thinking about much more than the plan for today. No ear worm songs in my head! (sorry lady gaga no abracadabra) way less overthinking I didnt wake up until my partners alarm went off this morning. Bam 💥 

Hopefully the “weirdness” is either adjusting to this med or probably my morning coffee which is a shame because coffee is a big part of my routine.. but it is what it is.. 
 
What are your thoughts or experiences with this adjustment? 

I’ll check In later, I have bathroom cabinets to paint 
Have a good day! ❤️💥🧠👍

1iuvwlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iuvwlz/age_of_beans_and_roast_level/,Age of Beans and Roast Level,"Sorry the long post. I want to make this post based on all the ones I see about dialing in. This primarily targeting anyone new to this who hasn't looked at the guide. The two most important aspects of a good shot is grind and beans. 

-----Age and staleness varies by roast level

When it comes to beans how long they can last before considered stale varies by roast level due to density. After roasting, beans degas which is basically them releasing CO2 over time that come from roasting. Green coffee compared to roasted coffee is incredibly dense and as it roasts, it basically becomes more porous. So, darker roasts degas faster than lighter roast and 2 months for say Starbucks veranda is not the same as 2 months for French roast. 

----What happens for beans to go stale

What happens with stale beans is that as the CO2 leaves, the different compounds degrade from essentially the lack of protection from the environment. This leads to requiring a way way way finer grind. I learned this from my dad using Lavazza beans while I used specialty. I tried using his beans in a k6. My normal grind size ran in like 10 seconds leaving everything else the same. I checked the date and they were 3 months old. 

-----Recommendations and Conclusion

Forget most of the accessories and focus your money on beans if you can. Get a self leveling spring tamper, wdt, decent hand or electric grinder ($75-$250) and FRESH BEANS from a roaster near you or order them. It'll make a huge difference and greatly decrease frustration. If it's still running fast after that, GRIND FINER. You can pull a good shot even from a 100$ machine. I ran a DeLonghi Stilosa with naked PF for 2 years before upgrading. I haven't been making espresso long but I've been making coffee and watching videos to make better cups for the past 4. So, not an expert but knowledgeable enough to help.

Also, when you decide to start buying specialty, lighter roasts will need a longer rest before the flavors can be experienced more. Light to Medium Roasts I'd say don't start using them until about 2-3 weeks after roast. Dark Roasts start using them 1-2 weeks after roast. You don't have to, it's your coffee.

Nung nagalit na ako, nirestrict ng bf ko yung chat nila. Pero si ate girl, sa IG naman nag-spam ng messages.

1iuvva9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1iuvva9/how_far_are_you_willing_to_go_to_not_buy_american/,How far are you willing to go to not buy American?,"I am curious about what are your limits to boycotting the US? Where do you draw your line? 

I think we all should think long and hard about what we are willing to do without. This is going to be a long game. We need to get mentally prepared for it. 

Me first. 

I am not willing to change my dogs food, they both like it and do very well on it. This is non-negotiable for me. 

I will not buy any processed food made in the US. My husband loves pudding, it is one of his food groups lol. All the premade puddings are made in US, same with packaged puddings. So, I will be making his pudding from scratch. 

For a truly horrifying story about food manufacturing in the US, read [this article. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/immigration-undocumented-workers-jobs.html?searchResultPosition=1)We haven't bought a US made frozen pizza or frozen entries since reading it. People die and maim themselves making our frozen foods. 

Bisquick is made in the US. You can make your own Bisquick mix, it needs to be kept in the fridge though, which makes me wonder how many preservatives are in the bought stuff. I will be making my own baking mix from now on. Yes, I will be playing Suzie Homemaker. 

Jello is from the US, same with unflavoured gelatin. So no more jello for me, I eat it for hair and nails, I have crappy hair and nails and it helps. 

BBQ sauce can be made easily at home. Mustard is readily available from other countries if none is made in Canada (haven't checked yet), I use a lot of asian sauces in my cooking and most of it comes from asia anyway, so no problem there. Hellmans mayo is made in Canada. And of course Frenchs Ketchup made in Ontario. I will likely have to make my own salad dressings.

No more peanut butter, we just bought sunflower seed butter, made and grown in Canada. It's pretty good.

A lot of the crackers my husband eats are US made, but we both like Wasa, and FinCrisp, and there are some lovely UK crackers, so that will work out.

Fruits and vegetables. This can be a tough one. A friend told me yesterday that she had to buy US onions because there were no Canadian/Mexican/other ones available. I have decided I won't buy any produce from the US, so things might not taste right, but we will get used to it. I will buy frozen instead but if there is only US grown, I won't buy it. Fortunately growing season will be here soon, so we will be able to grow our own or buy local. And growing sprouts is stupid easy. Then there is [this article](https://www.marketplace.org/2025/02/20/fda-layoffs-federal-workers-food-safety/) about US food safety, might not be safe to buy their food. 

Yes, I will be starting a vegetable garden this year, I hate gardening but right now I hate Trump more, so I will garden. Maybe only in pots but I will be growing some of our food. My own personal Victory garden. 

I will also be canning this year. Fortunately for me I like canning a whole lot more than I like gardening. I am fortunate to live in the Okanagan Valley in BC,, our growing season is long and fruits and vegetables are plentiful. The hard part, finding canning jars made in Canada. 

I gave up my beloved Dawn Ultra. That was a hard one. If I am washing greasy dishes I add a tablespoon of Nellie's Washing Soda to the sink, works just as well. Cleaning and laundry products made in Canada seem to be the easiest switch so that is a no brainer. Mostly using The Unscented Store. 

No more US made personal care products, but I was mostly there already. I use LiveClean shampoo and conditioner, Schmidts deodorant, Green Beaver castille soap, Cetaphil moisturizer (made in Canada version). Will be buying Marcelle cosmetics from now on. I wish I could afford Shiseido but alas. 

We cancelled Netflix and Amazon, but kept Crave, and I am going to pay for CBC Gem because Canadian. I am thinking about changing my email account to Proton and changing my browser from Chrome to ? Any ideas which browser to use?

No more Starbucks. No more McDonalds. I can make coffee at home and if I need a burger there is A&W or Whitespot, Mary Browns chicken if I have to have fried chicken. 

No travel to the US or over US air space, doesn't feel safe with all the cuts to the government there. See [this](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/jobs-cut-at-the-faa-helped-support-air-safety-a-union-says/).

Will you buy Canadian products at American owned stores? I find this one hard and I haven't decided how I am going to deal with this yet. 

What are you willing and not willing to do?

I’ve been driving for almost 4 years and have only once been in a drive thru. That was when my Dad was teaching me to drive in 2021

And I never went back because during that lesson, I scraped the side of the curb near the speaker and got freaked out. And almost hit the car in front of me.

Granted, that was 4 years ago this summer, but, every time I think about going through a drive thru I think about that moment.

But I’m tired of not doing the drive thru, because it’s a hassle to go inside all of the time, especially when I want coffee before work, and it’s just embarrassing when I’m out with friends. Plus I’m almost 21 I should know how to do this.

I've been with my partner for over 7 years, and each year I feel like he’s pulling me further into a dark hole. I’m over 30 now, and I’m scared to start over and leave him because I love him, but I’m also scared to stay like this.

He has borderline personality disorder, but he’s never wanted therapy or any kind of help. He doesn’t work, doesn’t help at home, smokes weed daily, wakes up at 2 PM, and needs another hour for his coffee and his joint before doing anything. He refuses to talk about the future and says that if I want to do things, I should do them alone. The reality is, I’m the one working, cooking, and cleaning.

Our relationship has become cold and empty. We don’t kiss or have sex anymore, and I’m always the one trying to initiate intimacy. Sometimes he’s affectionate, he hugs me, and he has helped me when I’ve had social anxiety attacks, like going to the doctor. But I feel like it’s not enough.

On Valentine’s Dayi had a excuse to do something togueter, he chose to go to a museum because every other option seemed boring to him. I agreed because we rarely do anything together, and I just wanted to spend time with him. But he was distant, smoking, rushing to leave because he didn’t like in the end the Museum he choose. At the end of the museum, there was an immersive room where all the couples were lying down, cuddling and watching the ocean visuals… and I was sitting alone while he stood there waiting to leave doing sings to leave.

I tried to talk about it at night, but it’s always the same. He apologizes, says this is just how he is, that he has no motivation for anything, and that if I want a different life, I should leave him. And when I push to talk about it, he just sleeps until it blows over. No reaction, no conversation—just sleep. The next day, he acts like nothing happened.

I have no family or friends , and it’s very hard for me to make them due to my social anxiety, autism, and PTSD. His family has known me for 7 years, but I still feel like an outsider, like I don’t really belong. Meanwhile, his brothers and their wives have it all: great jobs, houses with gardens, kids, stability, vacations and bouth familys do things togueter we are a bit the outcast . The wives don’t even work; they’re stay-at-home moms, but they live comfortably because their husbands earn well and have family support.

I’m still stuck in a tiny apartment that was only meant for me, thinking we would move out in a year… and yet 6 years later, we’re still here with barely place to move and  because is dificult find flat in this City and my boyfriend refuses to move to another City because he wants to stay where his parents are.


I’m thinking about moving out on my own for a couple of weeks to see how I feel without him. But I’m scared… scared of being alone, of never finding someone else, of regretting my decision. I also feel guilty because if I leave, I know he’ll spiral even further. But what about me I try to speak with the mother of him but her speech is like not taking me serius and looking the other way avoiding the drug adición of his son? How much longer do I have to keep sacrificing myself for someone who refuses to leave the hole he’s comfortable in?

If you’ve been in a relationship with someone with BPD, how did you find the strength to leave? How do you start over after so many years? Sorry if it was such a long Text. ",0,1740157512.0,BorderlinePDisorder,4,0.33,False

1iuvu12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1iuvu12/fearful_avoidant_blindsided_breakup/,Fearful avoidant blindsided breakup,"I have a history with avoidant men, who have always ended up friend zoning me. Each time after these relationships, I’ve become increasingly (self) aware and (hopefully) more and more secure. 

Recently, 1,5 years after my traumatic breakup – in which a former ex monkey branched from our relationship to the next, with a girl who still openly stalks me on social media up to this day – I met my more recent ex through a mutual friend. We dated for three months, and everything seemed great: calm, fast-paced but not overly intense. 

We met each other's families multiple times, went on a couple of overnight trips, and spent a lot of time together. My PMDD was barely noticeable during this time (unlike in my former relationship, where it was off the roof).

2 weeks ago, I was busy with a documentary festival and maybe a bit distant to him, but nothing out of ordinary, as we both enjoy our own space as well. He was still making future plans with me up until Monday, which was when I started to feel jittery for some reason (I tend to sense things strongly). 

On Tuesday night, he showed up at my place as agreed – but he was crying and saying that he’s very, very sad. In that heartbreaking moment, he ultimately told me he sees me as a friend. He kept on crying and I could see for the first time his vulnerable and sensitive side, and a glimpse of a devastated child in his eyes. 

He insisted none of it was my fault – that he enjoyed my company but felt ""something is missing"". We talked for hours and cried together.

I don’t understand how his feelings changed so suddenly, when he was just making plans with me. He had been walking and crying for hours before breaking up with me, and he seemed deeply conflicted. 

He said he wants to stay in my life as a friend. 

He has a history of short-term relationships, and now I’m left wondering if my temporary emotional distance triggered something, as I didn't pick up the phone on Monday (I was hyperfocused on a work thing, adhd hi!).

He previously mentioned that he has a strong need for control and order due to his mother's lack of order and (self-)discipline in his childhood. sometimes he sees those kinda traits as a weakness in others. I briefly wondered if that was about me (during PMDD, which is when my ADHD gets worse), but brushed it off.

During the breakup, I shared my fear of being ""too unbalanced for him,"" but he reassured me that my way of living wasn’t an issue, he he even saw our differences as a good thing. He’s not immature at all, ironically a psychologist, and we always had deep, long conversations. 

He confirmed I was never distant or inconsistent, nor did I make him feel inadequate (but confessed he'd had felt inadequacy and had people pleasing tendencies in former relationships, and used to push women away when he was younger, due to not wanting to deal with any difficult feelings).

Our relationship had been his best (at age 39) and he had never had this fun with anyone, he said, yet, something was missing.

It really doesn’t feel like a me problem. I suspect he might be avoidant, have commitment issues, or maybe r-ocd. 

After we got together, he had seemed like a new person, our mutual friend says, but now that he’s unemployed (since January), maybe he has too much time to overthink.

We spent 3–4 days a week together, and we were both initiating talks about living together, and he was on board with my dream of even getting a puppy. 

I matched his pace because it felt natural, but maybe he ended up freaking out. Regardless, for the first time, I know I shouldn’t blame myself. But I’m still confused.

I gave him a few days alone and called him last Saturday (as he’d said it’s ok if I need to reach out), and during the conversation we both started crying again. 

We went over the same things—he still can’t explain what’s missing but insists I did nothing wrong and that I’m much more than my PMDD. 

He says it’s fairer for both of us but wants to keep me in his life.
He also said he panicked after realizing the romantic feeling wasn’t there and likely wouldn’t come, as he knows himself well by the ripe age of 38. He simply hadn't thought it might be platonic before now since he had such a great time with me. 

I told him I’d sent him a letter (the day after BU) saying most of what we’ve already discussed, which made him cry even more.

We agreed he’d pick up his stuff tomorrow, and that we’d have coffee and talk. He likely has the letter by now, but I don’t think there’s hope of getting back together—he seems sure this is for the best. According to him, the panic wasn’t triggered by anything specific, just a few days of thinking.

I wonder if there’s something I could ask him tomorrow when we meet up. 

I have to add that this relationship was also the most secure and loving I've personally had, but since I had done some prior healing the pain isn't as excruciating as it was after being dumped by the toxic ex. I am aware I should direct my focus on myself now. However, something just doesn't add up. Why did he abruptly end it all? Was it all future faking and does he really not feel anything romantic, because to me it felt genuine, or did he just suddenly get triggered and leave?

Ever since the day of boards started, I feel weirdly stressed and frustrated. Even though both of my papers till now went amazing. I wonder if something went wrong. 

My heartbeat isn’t slowing down and I don’t know how to tell anyone. I feel tired and want this to end. No I don’t plan on killing myself but I feel like it sometimes. 

Today, the literature paper went amazing and all. I was so worried that I was crying the day before because I couldn’t study properly and just feel weirdly unprepared. 

When I was in exam hall, I was so stressed and my heartbeat was beating so much and I felt scared. It was also because I climbed 6 stairs while chatting with a friend but I would have calmed down in 2 minutes especially after I drank water. I only felt calm while giving the paper because it was easy and I got it. 

I told my mom before the exam but I didn’t tell her it’s happening all the time. So I tried telling my father subtly and jokingly tonight but I didn’t realise that he would answer jokingly. They care but I don’t know how to tell them.

1iuvq0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iuvq0l/i_31f_have_realised_ive_lost_all_sense_of_self_in/,I (31F) have realised I’ve lost all sense of self in my relationship with my partner (35F). But what can I do with the realisation?,"Over the last week and a half or so I have begun making the realisation that my relationship of nearly 4 years is eroding my sense of self and my self worth to the point where I’m unsure if A) I have any left and B) even who I am at this point anymore, but realisation isn’t enough without knowing what to do with the information so here I am humbly presenting my problems to the internet broadly. 

I will preface by saying that I do acknowledge that she *is* smarter than me as undisputed fact. She has more than one advanced degree from prestigious universities and holds a prestigious position at a well respected academic organisation. She is very, very smart. I have advanced degrees of a lesser sort from lesser schools and did not ever have a prestigious job. I’m just laying this out as a foundation for one of my complaints—I do know she’s smarter than me, but it doesn’t necessarily change the complaint on the whole. 

So with that said:

1) I feel like I’m treated like I am stupid all the time. If we watch a documentary about anything that’s a bit more advanced than what the BBC might broadcast she will pause it to ask if I understand what is being said. She did it the other day with a topic I have a masters degree in and I had to get up and leave the room. When I’ve brought this up she acts startled that I would even think this even when presented with the evidence. 

2) I feel like I am not a welcome person in my own home/like I take up too much space/like there’s no safe/secure space of my own to go to. For example: we have a sofa with a chaise. She sits on the bit with the chaise. I’m quite tall, so she doesn’t want me to lay across the sofa-y bit and put my feet on her. Our coffee table is made of hard wood and metal. The only other options are armchairs also with no footrests, so i have to sit awkwardly like I’m at a stranger’s house. She also says that I take up too much room in the bed (she doesn’t like to be touched in her sleep) and doesn’t like that my childhood stuffed animals (2) are also in the bed. Last night one of my stuffed animals touched her as we were falling asleep (a Peter Rabbit; so it was the ears) and she pitched him across the room. She also complains about the amount of noise I make—says I sneeze too loud, laugh too loud, talk too loud, and clatter pots and pans about too loudly when I cook. Last night I had a stress dream about clattering pans about, which was actually a welcome change from having stress dreams that I had to go back to year 9 even though i’m 31 years old. However, I don’t get privacy. She will come in the bathroom whilst I’m trying to take a shower and knock about or use the toilet. If I did this there would be problems. 

3) Since I am largely self employed and largely work from home she’s put me in charge of the house tasks and it’s just become so incredibly disheartening for me because there’s zero contribution without attitude from her and I feel like an automaton just fruitlessly doing the same tasks every single day with no reward, and daily I just fall into despair of not being able to do it anymore. 

4) She shows little interest in anything that I’m interested in, or do, or buy, but expects it from me. Example: I bought clothes a few weeks ago and showed them to her. She was bored and didn’t look up from what she was doing. I asked if she liked them, she said “to be honest I don’t care.” If I did the same thing it would be a days long protracted calamity. Similarly I asked to hang a print of a specific art piece I love in the living room. She kind of did a judgemental face and finally said “well, if you love it so much that’s fine….” but I have to agree with her about anything she wants (or keep my mouth shut). The art piece is not in the living room as of now. 

I am tired. I feel like I’m just spending all my time making myself smaller, quieter, more appealing in some way. I’m not sure I could tell you any specific like or dislike I have or if any of those things are presently reflected in my home. I know consciously that this is not a good situation, but knowing something and doing something about it are two completely different things. What *can* I do with it? If I don’t think I necessarily yet want to leave—and when I ask her if she’s happy, if she loves me, etc, she becomes very tender and says yes, she does, and that yes, she is, and talks about the future quite warmly—how do I approach and begin fixing the problems now that I’ve identified them? Or is it an unfixable problem? 

TL;DR: I have realised I’ve lost all sense of myself in my long term relationship and I am unclear on how to fix it; seeking help from the people of reddit. Thank you! ",4,1740157255.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

well my wife had this girlfriend that was always dripping in money yet she didn’t work and always had a man hanging from her arm we often wondered how she managed it speculating that it must be drug money or something like that well long story short my wife found out she was pregnant and had a miscarage which floored her and she had to give up work for a bit which ment I had to double down with my work doing more hours so during this time she started to spend more time with her friend as they grew closer often spending the night there I’d drop her off and pick her up when I finished work 

the bills were beginning to mount up with just the one wage coming in so I took a second job driving a taxi it was flexible and good manage it around my main job meantime my wife started using her game new makeup getting dressed up to go to her friends giving the exscuse of you have seen her I just want to fit in which knowing what girls are like I payed no attention to this but my wife now seemed to be having money just enough to cover the little things that most wouldn’t notice I wasn’t home much working two jobs so I was grateful my wife had a good friend who was always willing to have my wife around as company I was thinking I’m putting in the long yards now for a pay off later on with work getting the bills down just putting my head down and getting on with things obviously as we didn’t see much of each other our sex lifes were suffering to the point it was litraly none exsistant which was beginning to take a tollon our relationship 

things all came to a head one night I was out in the taxi it been a quiet night until I get a call on the radio for a pick up in a realy nice bit of town I got there and as instructed I just hit the horn and stayed in the car two guys well dressed got in the back seat along with my wife’s girlfriend between them and they gave me tha address to drop them off it was her house so I thought nothing of it she hadn’t noticed it was me driving as the three of them started to fool around on the backseat as talking my wife’s friend telling them how much they would enjoy her friend when they met her aparantly she’s a very high demand girl so it was going to cost them exstraI got to the house and as they got out one of the guys handed me a £20 tip which I was happy at I looked across to the door of the house only to see my wife open the door dressed in only her underwater and high heels she smiled and hugged her friend then kissed the guys as they went into the house I was flabergasted not knowing what to do I drove around the corner and parked up just sitting there trying to proces what I’d seen I got out of the car walked back to the house crept up to the lounge window and perked in what I saw took my breath away all four of them were naked and my wife was being fucked by the guy who tipped me and she was putting on quite a show with him I watched in dis belive for a few minuets and the guy finished with her and handed her to the other guy who started fucking her as well I went back to the car called in for the night and went home in the morning my wife called me to pick her up I went and got her not talking all the way home when we got into the house my wife asked me what was up why I was so quiet I ignored her for a bit and made some coffee she didn’t stop asking me again I just said I saw you last night you didn’t see me I was the driver who dropped those guys off to you she paused for a moment before crumpling to the floor crying begging me to forgive her as I went upstares and started packing her bags wer done I told her she begged me to let her exsplane i needed to hear this for my own sanity so let her tell me why she had done it she exsplane that her friend and how she got her money was from escort work and she had convinced my wife to try it she only did it once to try get some money so I could cut back my hours but she found it made her feel something inside as we haven’t been intimate for so long so she did it again telling herself this is the last time but she was hooked she eventually confessed she’d been working as an escort for six months but it was ok as she’d saved up so much money to pay the bills I asked her straight there and then would you ever told me if I haddent caught her she just looked at the floor and said no are you going to stop now no was the reply it’s just sex I don’t love these men it’s just sex with them that was enough for me I throw her bags out the front door we’ll go live with your whore friend then as I throw her out as well 

as far as I’m awair she did go to her friends my divorce papers were sent there for her and as far as I’m awair she’s still there today both of them in there 50s still fucking for money as for me I’m now married to my wife with two grate kids and a few grandkids life definetly changed that day for me and I haven’t looked back now owning my own hotel and business is doing well ",40,1740157173.0,cheating_stories,8,0.93,False

1iuvoju,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iuvoju,How to fix an old seherezádé/szarvasi/szász kotyogó/moka pot,"First of all I made this post once already but reddit for some reason didn't post the pretty lengthly body text added to it so I am posting it again.

Backstory:
This post is meant as a answer to my previous post and a quide for anyone having the same issue as me and can't find an answer just like I couldn't.
I bought a vintage hungarian moka machine a while back in a thrift store I used it maybe 3 times since then and it always bugged me that the pressure relief valve was blowing of steam the whole time and the coffee was sppluring out of the nozzle, yesterday i decided to dissasemble the relief valve and it consisted of a hollow screw some kind of sealing ring (which I later found out was just molted metal) and 2 piston looking things(photos of it in a previous post) after searching for 15 miutes on the internet I couldn't find anything about it so I posted here almost nobody replied and those who replied didn't know anything about it so I thought about blocking it off and installing a classic bialetti relief valve.
But today I had a day free off work so I decided to call over my hungarian grandmother and started intensly searching for an answer on hungarian forums.

Solution: the relief ""valves"" on these old hungarian mokas where the valve is on top near the bayonet locking mechanism doesn't use the traditional spring multi-use relief valve but a primitive ball made from some kind of soft metal that melts in case something is clogged in the system or you leave it on the stove for too long, after melting it realeases the pressure and you have to replace it (on pictures 2 and 3 you can see how it melted and copied the shape of the screw on my moka) , they are called olvadó golyó and you can find them really cheap on many different hungarian sites (idk if any of them ship worldwide) they also sell complete repair kits(shown on pic 1)
which i will be buying to repair my moka.

Here are some links to those sites

I'm a pretty frugal person and I only eat out for lunch maybe 4-5 times a month, but when I do I use Amex credits.

Every month I load $7 onto my Dunkin Donuts app and use that for a quick meal when I'm driving a long distance for work.  They always have a $6 meal deal that includes a sandwich, small bag of hash browns, and a medium hot/iced coffee.

I'll also use the Gold card dining credit for a Five Guys burger once a month.  From my local store it's $10.22 for a cheeseburger after taxes.

I'll also use the Uber Eats $10 for pickup nearby for lunch or dinner.  The go to is usually getting a deal offer from Domino's Pizza or some offer than is around $10.

Then I'll use the $20 credit on the Business Gold to buy food gift cards from Staples.  My go to there is two $10 gift certificates to Chipotle or a $25 Panera gift card.

The Vertuo Pop is currently cheap on Amazon, with 50 free pods from Nespresso (+ the ones that come with it) 

This sounds incredibly good value, and great for my use case, but I've heard very positive things about the original line machines, and more mixed feelings on cheaper Vertuo machines and that they are not as reliable, which has made me pause.

An Original Line L'oR Sublime is just slightly more, and an Evoluo Vertuo is just slightly more than that.

There's so many different options I'm struggling to decide, any insight would be appreciated!

SO and i have been in counseling for two years bc of it. he makes progress, but slowly. SO is fucking petrified of her and i want to be direct with her but have been told it’s not my place bc he is the bridge between us (per our therapist..). i have to medicate before i see MIL because my nervous system pops off when i know i have to be around her. i already blocked her number because the dread of her contacting me makes me sick. she’s awful in person and over the phone, but puts on this loving facade when she texts. some examples of her behavior include crying because SO wouldn’t stay the night with her on xmas and was holding him from behind calling him her baby (he’s 30), MIL screamed at me in front of a group of guests because i didn’t make a second pot of coffee, MIL demands SO do things for her instead of asking, and just recently told us “good luck affording anything and leaving your family” when we told her we were moving (we’re 100% financially independent). when i first met MIL, she was drunk and got in my face telling me i needed to have twins so she and her sister could both have one. i’m exhausted and would never ask my partner to choose between us. any advice? i feel like i have limited options. go nc to protect my peace and keep on with our relationship? put up with her shit so there’s less external conflict? or is this something that needs to be severed? i hate that MIL makes me question our entire relationship, but i’m not even in contact with my own JUSTNO (i mean mom, but trying to follow the rules and didn’t understand that one completely) bc she is just like MIL, so why would i let MIL stay in my life?

So a player in my campaign was very, very adamant that his character's goal is to open a coffee shop. So the he did the requisite quest, adventured to the mysterious lands of Aird Kabira and found the mythical city of Viverridae, made friends with the Civet-folk denizens and has secured a supply of coffee beans. We've agreed that it will a traveling Coffee wagon run for him by a NPCs. The actual in-game effects of this is that each morning, the party will each get a coffee of they day, which are basically a potion that must be consumed within 24 hours.

Regardless of the specific brew, each coffee will remove a level of exhaustion for the next hour. At the end of that hour, if they had levels of exhaustion before drinking the potion, they gain back a level of exhaustion and roll a d20. On a 9 or less, they gain an additional level of exhaustion.

On top of this, each day's coffee has its own unique effects. The ones I've come up with so far are:

**Perk Up Brew** \- For the next hour, you get advantage on intelligence and wisdom based checks and saving throws.

**Double Shot Supper Expresso** \- For the next minute after drinking, at the start of each turn roll a d6. On an even number you have all the benefits of the haste spell until the start of your next turn.

**Heavenly Roast** \- You regain 2d4+2 hit points, and can one disease or condition affecting you. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

**Devil's Brew** \- You gain 3d8 temporary hit points and for the next hour you can understand infernal but are vulnerable to radiant damage.

**Elemental Cold Brew** \- For the next hour you gain resistance to fire damage. Instead of consuming the brew, you can use it as an improvised weapon with a range of 15/30. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 cold damage and must succeed on a DC 20 constitution save or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

What I would appreciate are suggestions for additional coffee themed potions to add to the rotation. All puns and silliness are appreciated. Also, if you think anything above can use revision, please feel free to share improvements. ",3,1740156873.0,dndnext,0,1.0,False

First my apology for my poor english writting, I’m French I could write in French but I feel words comes easyer in English and it is way less painfull at the moment.

P : my ex
B : our son
L : my date

Sooooo, I’ve been in a relationship with P for more than 9 years, we first met on an internet dating app and, after long conscistent talk for a month I proposed her for a date in Paris (we both live two hours from the city). So we met in Paris a city I know for all my life and I had the pleasure to show her all the places she wanted to see. I booked hotels for the three days (different hotels in different areas of the city, I worked in the hotel industry at the time) , this was a good time we spend together, we kissed and fucked on the first day and the story began like that in the most romantic way.

But from day one I met her, I knew that I did not loved her and never will. How can I explain now that eveyrthing is over that I fooled myself and her for so long ?

At this time of my life, I was 25, living with my parents, I was looking for an escape that’s for sure and I found it in P. So we moved together two month after first kiss under le Sacré Cœur, and started couple life. One year later a dog entered our life, my first dog, a Beagle.

One year later we moved in a little house. Family life was appearing in the most simple, classic way. I already was bored to death about that, I wanted to be alone and have my appartment and do my stuff as I wanted when I wanted to.

This house, althought not particulary big had the advantage to have many rooms so we decided that each of us sleep in one room in order to enjoy big beds. Some couple do that and have a happy loving life, i’m not judging but for us it was the beginning of the end we where roommates now. We had sex from time to time (once a month ?) we shared meals, family time always together  but deep down we knew that it was over.

Then came the kid, our beloved son B  was born with a rare desease and spend long long time in the hospital, many surgery operations. Anxiety was melted with pure love, we were together very very strong and helping for each other at the hospital, in time of crisis and after at home. With this desease, P had to stop working so incomes where decreasing  she had to stop everything while I was working, escaping from this child only reality that became her prison in a way. I was willing to help by reducing  my work time by half for her to work equally but this wasn’t possible and made me feel guilty to leave her alone during the day.

The years passed, B was 3 years old and began school, only in the morning, P still could not work. B's health was improving, P's mental health was declining, just like mine surrounded by the addictions against which I had been fighting victoriously for 5 years. We had to move from a small house to a practical apartment, close to school and my work but without soul: a new prison.

My alcoholism returned stronger, I refused any hands that previously helped me fight the addiction, P was worried and very sad to see me sinking every day, lying to her by hiding bottles everywhere, trust was lost. But we remained together under the same roof, playing family life while the routine and omnipresence of the other (I came home to eat every lunchtime and we did absolutely everything together) permanently contaminated the little desire that sometimes appeared, most of the time at the initiative of P. I had lost all will and capacity to seduce her, our already low personal confidence was at its lowest.

To get back on track we had an idea that had been hanging around since long before the birth of our child: getting married. So from February 2024 to February 2025 we embarked on this great adventure, pretending not to see that it would not change anything in our lives, that it would not bring us closer together.

I was sober the day we broke up, I went home from work, made dinner, little practical chat about the kid and house maintenance, reading a story for the kid to fell asleep (always), then I saw she changed her Facebook and added a quote of a Harry Styles song saying  « love you like you’re leaving » so I asked Her with simple humour, not judging, just curiously why this quote ? Three weeks before our weeding it was, for the least, strange. So she argued that she will change the pic quote and then she revealed me that my mom asked her two days before If she was ready to be my wife ?

So she asked me later if I was ready, how I saw things after marriage, what would it really change? The decision was already made, for both of us in the end. We decided to cancel everything.

Quickly came the dizziness of organizing the breakup, the shock for my parents (who still don't understand, who are simply afraid for us) and the true, deep, sincere goodwill of all our loved ones that we were to receive during the wedding, each of whom saw it as a form of courage that we actually felt.

Three days pass, without much difference between us since we were already friends more than lovers and, three days after the separation was recorded, she tells me that she slept with an old date from before we met (more than 10 years ago) during the day (kid was with his grand parents). I completely accepted his frankness and told her that for the moment I had no intention of dating anyone. But actually I ruminated and a few days later I installed apps and started chatting with girls very quickly. I quickly organized a meeting with let’s name her L, , she lives an hour's drive away, same age, is chatty and I really like the photos, so we agree on a coffee in her town on a Saturday where P will be with her family with the kid and the dog.

I arranged to meet her in a bookstore, a neutral and quiet place. She tooks me to a restaurant but full and we end up in a very very cute Chinese establishment. We immediately get along very well, the meal was excellent and our laughter already mingling. Then we had a long walk around his pretty town, visited some shops and ended up kissing a lot, for a long time in the streets and then later in a bar. I was supposed to return in the evening but this idea displeases me more minute by minute and while our physical proximity is at the maximum of what is allowed in a pub I explained her that I would like to spend some more time with her, at her place so, obviously I wanted more, and I feel that she does too but we directly put a barrier by mutually promising not to act out this evening... at her house it is barely after we had eaten a little snack that the situation became hotter, so what was supposed to happen happens and we are each very happy about it, no real sleep until the morning but I had to leave.

I hide nothing from her, L,  about my family situation, my recent breakup, the situation which means that we still live under the same roof with my ex.

I go home, my ex, my son and my dog​​ have not returned yet, P calls me to find out all the details of what happened, she is very angry on the phone, sad and lost. She cries, tells me that it's too early, that I'm not ready to engage a relationship, that I'm going to hurt everyone by acting like this, that I'm already forgetting my family responsibilities, to which I respond that she's the first who went to fucking with another one. Later, she calls me again on the way back to the place where we still live together, she explains to me that she also has a date that same evening, I agree, without judgment. When she returns from her meeting she is devastated but also furious, explains to me that the guy was an asshole, very disappointing in bed because yes they fucked. She still blames me for my date the day before, telling me that there's no way I'll see her again, that it won't lead to anything, the atmosphere is tough. She tell me that she won’t look for anyone else and that I should remain alone also and concentrate on the kid (which I deeply love and take care everyday as her so her point is completely irrelevant for me).

Well that’s it for now, I’m planning to continue see this girl, L, because she’s good to me and P has to accept that.

Thank you for reading, it helped me, I’m lost of course, this is the only thing I can do to discernate what I want.

1iuvjq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/1iuvjq5/the_screaming_lady_is_making_me_spiral_pt_iv/,The screaming lady is making me spiral | Pt. IV,"Did you think we’d get to a Part IV? I certainly didn’t.

On 1/28/25, I received an update from our lieutenant assigned to the case the same day Angel was arrested and 5150’d. I was told she was taken to Long Beach College Hospital. She will spend a week there under evaluation. That’s exactly where my sister went, who is now recovering and healing in section 8 housing. There is hope!

It was explained to me that these mentally ill individuals are tough to place and relocate. They like their spots and feel comfortable in their surroundings. So when you move them, they need to acclimate to their new environment with new people and it could get dangerous. This is all such a delicate dance. I understand that. But she’s gotta go somewhere!

I took the momentum of Angel’s arrest and went to my leasing office to tell my story. Surely there was something they could do. I had brought up the screamer a couple times to the office, but they showed little empathy and have offered me less desirable courtyard units or remodeled, more expensive units instead. Nothing in the same price range. From my Reddit posts, a couple neighbors messaged me about Angel. One neighbor contacted the Lieutenant and complained. Finally, I have someone else on my side!

About a week following her arrest, I am woken up by Angel at 4AM. It was an early session. I was in denial at first, but why am I at all surprised? How did she find her way back so easily. She is clearly not that far out of her mind if she can get on a bus and navigate back to SM.

Angel came back on 2/6/25. She wore a black and white plaid shirt. She only carried some white plastic shopping bags with her instead of her usual black backpack, skateboard and duffel. She alternated between the bench and her grass spot. If on the bench, she’d often swivel her neck back around and talk to my building. No yelling, just mumbling.  If on the grass, she’d just stare. There were few words. Was this progress? I certainly don’t mind Angel living in the park. But when she is a nuisance, it’s absolutely unbearable.

Angel does not want housing or help. She refuses all of it. I am bothered by this woman’s actions. In my opinion, she is disturbing the peace. But what is peace? Is she at peace and I am disturbing hers? That’s certainly what it feels like in this ongoing, gaslighting situation. Authorities and myself agree she should be institutionalized, but the city won’t pay for it is my understanding.

The Lieutenant told me of a few different cases in the area to shine some perspective on the homelessness problems. We have a serial pooper who continuously poops on people’s front doors. Another man who refuses to be anywhere else but on the doorstep of a daycare. So take your pick, SM! There are more issues than just the screamer. But I am not taking that as an excuse to not do anything about my problem.

The Lieutenant emailed me with an update to not only myself, but my neighbor as well. He cc’d us both and included our names and emails. Goodbye anonymity! I emailed my neighbor to show my appreciate for taking the time to email police. Nothing back. I get it. It was probably super overwhelming for my neighbor because my lieutenant responded immediately to him with a lengthy email saying we were planning on an arrest the next day. 

Well, the very next day Angel was sleeping until I left for work. So no action was taken.

Last week, I was in my parking garage waiting for the elevator. Ding. The doors open. Out walks a beautiful woman with long brown hair. We both glanced at each other and said hello. She turned the corner and looked back. I had to ask her out. We went to coffee the next day. About 10 minutes into our lattes, we inevitably talk about Santa Monica, our building and MY living situation. I couldn’t help but to bring up my issue! I haven’t really connected with anyone in the building, so this was my shot. After summarizing Parts 1-3 of my journey to her, she then looks at me and says, “She’s dead.” 

Of course I knew exactly what article she was talking about- alluding to the homeless black lady that was killed in her sleep a couple weeks ago in a sleeping bag. “No no no” I said, trying to cut her off. I assured her that I was woken up by the screaming that very morning and Angel is very much alive. But for a second, she went straight for the guilt trip! It’s so wild how I can’t find anyone to side with me in real life, but on the internet everyone seems to agree that this is intolerable! 

This girl lives a few floors above me. She sleeps with her balcony slider open and has never been woken up by Angel. I don’t have the heart to send her a link to clue her in on what’s going on below. This girl did validate that she at least can see Angel. I’ll take any validation I can get for my sanity’s sake. 

A couple days later, I woke up to Angel screaming at 5:00am like clockwork. I call the police and said “I have the arrest form. Please arrest her.” A unit will be sent out I was told by dispatch. Like whack-a-mole, the cops show up when Angel is back to sleeping 30 minutes later. I texted the lieutenant to let him know I called the police. He responds and says “So much for a week off.”

So now I am being guilt tripped for even contacting the police. This is the second time he expressed exhaustion. The first time was “So much for a day off!”. What am I supposed to say to that? 

Well, that same day my friend texted me about his neighbor moving out next door. He wasn’t even aware of my chronic living situation. This was a sign from God to get out. I am taking the apartment. 

I AM MOVING! A year and a half of dealing with Angel with literally zero progress. Unreal. The screaming lady made me spiral. She did it. She won.

Once I realized I was a burden to the police, I didn’t want to call anymore. Everything seemed like a joke! Now I wanted the problem to stay put out of resentment. Fine. Deal with her! I put in a lot of effort to try to take care of this issue. After back surgery, I’ve got other things to catch up on. Why would I clean this place up just to move out? Angel is not my problem or responsibility. 

But what do you do when it’s 5:00am and you literally have nowhere to go? Coffee shops aren’t even open until 6:00. Calling the police is the only solution I can possibly come up with at that hour. But it’s not even the fix. Once again, my life feels like The Truman Show. No matter what I do, the same shit will happen the very next day.

TODAY, I woke up at 5:00am to the screaming. I text the lieutenant and call authorities. 45 minutes later a patrol car shows up. A unit has never once responded in under 30 minutes. Angel’s rants go in about 30  minutes bursts. Then nap, then rant. Nap. Rant. Basically, the cops show up as soon as she settles. So the unit rolls by with lights and shakes a finger. Another 45 minutes go by and I get a call from an officer trying to find her. “What does she look like? How old? What’s she wearing?” The same exact questions every single time. A different officer every single time. 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN ""what does she look like?"" ""Where is she?"" ""What's her name?"" 

Hundreds of calls at this point and I need to explain myself and the situation once more? You must be joking. Information does not travel within PD. There is no small town sheriff here. I've spoken to a different officer every single time. 

Once again, I feel like a Karen or the little boy crying wolf. 

Here is this morning’s clip. I am now able to understand more of her dialogue. “Hey cracker.. taking away my freedom?? call PD.. call PD.. ohhh you gonna take video? You gonna take video?"" Yesterday, she was reciting the ABC’s over and over. Makes me wonder if she was getting speech therapy when she was 51510’d. She got her duffel bag and skateboard back yesterday. She is back to sparking up some weird drug that is definitely not weed. I think she’s stronger than ever.

She is the final boss.

This is how I woke up today:  
[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nRYr8ZI30k0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nRYr8ZI30k0)  
There is no question in my mind that she is talking directly at my silhouette in the window.

If you're reading this and want to continue the fight without me, reach out and I'll give you all the contacts to carry on. Godspeed, SM. I deleted my previous posts, but I'll leave this post up for the next person that moves into my apartment. Hopefully I can help them out.

I'll be here for a few more weeks and then I'll be out of your hair.

Since I am new, I need to depend on other senior colleagues for doing my job. 
As I am not in a friendly relationship with them, they are not ready to guide me mostly.
Still, I can understand that they have to do their own work and guiding me is not part of their job I cant blame them too.
But I have been thinking now a days that if i had been friendly from day 1 by forcefully making myself to build the conversation i wont be in a situation of being left alone.
BTW,i not even drank coffee with them 🫠

When i ask my friend he says that i need to be literally an extrovert to avoid situations like this and to survive in office culture but still it is my choice to be as per my wish.
They are advising me to go and talk.
But I say like ""What to talk,,🙃"". (I can only feel comfortable speaking if i need something or topic. But that also made me looks like ""He will speak only if there is a need for him"")
If I somehow forcefully made myself and approch them, I feel like ""Why he was being fake"" this is what others will think of me.

I dont know what to do now

As I understand is volumetric and I should probably pull manual with a scale but I’m curious when I grind too fine obviously no coffee comes out but the timer stops at 20 seconds and doesn’t even try to extend longer to get more coffee out. Where’s the 60 ml of water going then? lol because nothing at all will come into the cup at 20 seconds. 

I’m finding it a bit weird because I’m struggling to get the machine to keep pushing water longer than 20 seconds if I go fine or course. On my first ever shot I was able to get 30 seconds I was so excited but something has happened since then. I reset the settings. It’s sort of making me anxious like something is wrong. 

Also when I tamp I’m noticing coffee around the edges of inside the basket. Is that something to bother too much about? 

I love the idea of this machine and so far the coffees seem to have tasted ok no matter if it’s course or fine it’s tasting better than the junk I was having before but I sort of regret getting the machine because it’s put me into an obsessive state to get the perfect 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds.

My concern is that they're most likely inside the tubing and machinery deeper in the machine.

 She believes she ""got rid of the eggs"" because she saw a lot of them on the ledge where the side panel rests. She says she hasn't seen any today, but other people who work many hours claim to only have ever seen one or two, ever. If we just wipe under, around, and the outside ledges will this be enough to get rid of them?

1iuv63p,https://i.redd.it/8t5s3j1usike1.jpeg,Screwed by Goettl’s,"Last Wednesday, I was working on a clients 100+ year old house, replacing the porch. The client asked me to check on a some water she saw going over the sill in the back. I found a break in the cast iron 2” drain line from the kitchen sink. I called out Goettl’s, as I have an annual subscription (they almost never take jobs up here in Jerome). Their plumber came up Wednesday. Took a look at it, and put together a quote for fixing it. $3200. 

He said they will have to cut the concrete and expose the pipe 2’ down and that they would make the repair, and make sure there were not any problems further down that line, via camera. 

He described what sounded like a couple of day’s work, and he said it could be more, given what they find further down.

I reluctantly signed off, believing it was a major fix. The client is a school teacher, and she gasped when I told her the quote. 

Anyway, Friday morning comes, and the same plumber shows up with his partner. Me and the client are having coffee beside a window to the side yard, where the two plumber are setting their tools down. We can hear them talking, as they are about 7’ away from the window. The plumber who provided the quote is talking to his partner when he say “It’ll really take us less than an hour.”

That’s what happened, they spent a total of one hour and fifteen minutes on site. The rest of the day they were fucking off in town. 

The client asked me if they were going to reduce the price of the fix if they had so little work to do, and I said I didn’t know how binding the contract would be, but the right thing to do would be to be to re-quote the job. 

At about three the quote guy comes up and says they are all done. Takes me back to show me what’s been done, and sure a shit, they hadn’t had to cut the concrete, they just swapped the old cast iron 90 with pvc, put a rubber coupler at the sill, and that was it. He said the line is full of roots starting 1.5’ down, and that the line is probably separated. I asked why they hadn’t addressed it, and they said it wasn’t included in the quote. 

I am attaching photos of the fix. 

We really don’t know how to approach this. She is on a fixed income, I have paid the bill, and she has reimbursed half, and I don’t have the heart to ask for the rest, until I understand from y’all’s perspective.

From across a desk on the far side of the small room, another human looked at him, one eyebrow raised in question.

“I am, uhm, Captain Josh. I, er, have an appointment?”

“Ah, yes. My two o'clock. You can call me Jake, if you like - I will be with you in a second, I am just reviewing your case. You can get yourself a coffee from the dispenser if you like.”

Josh dialled up a coffee as Jake returned his attention to the small screen built into the standard desk, then planted himself in the single multi-species sitting contraption that was facing the desk. After a while Jake looked up again, one eye twitching.

“So…” Jake started, “I can see why they send you to me. I like working with them, but they don't know how to, uh, how to put…”

“They said something about letting Terrans work it out between themselves.” Josh offered.

“Sounds about right. So…Let me see if I get this straight, Captain Josh. As far as I can make out from these case notes, you decide to land on a planet inhabited by a pre-spaceflight industrialised species.”

Josh nodded as Jake looked up.

“Despite, I might point out, this being very much not allowed by the Galactic Union. The Galactic Union, may I remind you Captain Josh, who has issued you with a cross species trading permit.”

“Yeah,” Josh said as he looked into his coffee, “It is a lot easier to shift some dodgy cargo on those worlds.”

Jake thumbed the screen as he kept reading.

“And in the process, you and your crew also pulled some fairly standard me-superior-being-from-the-stars lies. Which, as you know, the Galactic Union frowns upon very much.”

Josh gave a one shoulder shrug as he emptied his coffee cup.

“You know how it is out there - if there isn't a market, create one. Got to turn a profit to stay in business.”

“Ah, yes. A market for, if I'm not mistaken, a large cargo of inexpensive microwave ovens?”

“I prefer the term Science Ovens, if you please. It sells better.”

“Science ovens? As used by aliens from Betelgeuse to Rigel, I'm sure.”

Josh cracked a small smile as he nodded.

“Pretty much. We shifted a lot of S'pht Spoo as well, it heats up well in a microwave.”

Josh kept scrolling, not looking up.

 “Really? I can't stomach the stuff myself. At least you and your crew didn't go full Ancient Aliens on them. We have pulled trading permits for less than that, you know.”

Josh smiled a little wider, crumpling the cup up in one hand.

“No one tries to pull that one any longer, you know. It makes it more difficult to shift cargo on the next visit.”

Jake shrugged as he looked straight at Josh.

“At any rate, as you were about to leave, you let off a flippant remark about their moon. A single, flippant remark.”

Josh looked down at the crumpled cup in his palm.

“Yeah. Off the cuff, so to speak. I wanted to, I don't know, give them something better than the one about returning when the stars align again.”

Jake shook his head.

“A single, flippant remark, delivered to a species who had just gotten their world view turned upside down… A single, flippant remark which had the result that the species - the entire species - changed their whole culture almost overnight, devoted all their resources into making their cities mobile, and are now constantly moving about trying to be on the opposite side of the planet to their moon at all times.”

Josh kept looking down.

“They were certainly taken aback by my remark, yes.”

“Consuming, I might add, their resources at a frightening rate. At the last observed rate, they are likely to regress to a pre-industrial society within a generation or two.”

Josh looked up at Jake.

“I guess?”

Jake looked back at Josh, one corner of his mouth twitching.

“Honestly Captain Josh... that is the single best prank I heard all year. Definitely Hall of Fame material.”

Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings

I'm actively reducing my hours and searching for better income opportunities elsewhere.

**The Pay:** Embarrassingly low for what they expect from us. Breaking your back for minimum wage just isn't worth it.

**Expectations vs. Reality:** Management demands perfection while giving you impossible workloads. You're juggling customer service, stocking, and cleaning simultaneously with minimal support.

**Turnover Nightmare:** There's a reason faces constantly change. I barely learn coworkers' names before they've quit.

**Soul-Crushing Boredom:** Each shift feels eternal. Same tasks, same aisles, same problems on repeat.

**The ""Music"":** That playlist haunts my dreams now. The same songs, day after day, drilling into your skull.

**Management Issues:** Most of our managers are stressed out themselves and it shows. They rarely acknowledge good work but immediately notice any small mistake.

**Recency Bias:** Have one bad day or call in sick? Suddenly my months of reliable service mean nothing. I'm treated like I'm always underperforming based on a single off day.

**Zero Motivation:** There's simply no incentive to work harder. No meaningful recognition, no reason to care.

**The ""Uniform"":** They give you ONE shirt. That's it. A single shirt and a coffee cup is all you get as your ""welcome package."" Need steel cap boots for safety? That's coming out of your own pocket. Because apparently protecting your feet while moving heavy stock isn't their concern. Need a hat for work to do your job? You gotta buy that too.

I know most minimum wage jobs share these issues to some degree. This isn't unique to Woolworths, but I wanted to warn anyone considering this as a ""good job"" - it isn't. 

That said, if you enjoy repetitive, meaningless tasks and can shut your brain off completely, you might actually thrive here. For everyone else, consider yourself warned.

That strong chemical odor that lingers and feels like the store has zero airflow.

Avoiding stores like the above-mentioned is impossible, every high street or mall has them, and there‘s no getting past without smelling them. 

Does anyone have an idea on how to get through that smell without getting sick? Like an „antidote“ smell kinda thing? Are there any smells that are known to work against migraine-inducing chemical smells, that are kind of common to know that they‘re alright. Like how we say coffee neutralizes the sense of smell in between smelling things.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It is my (20F) 21st birthday tomorrow. I am currently pregnant and expecting a little one with my baby dad (25M) in August. 

Over the course of this week I've obviously been thinking about my birthday. Every girl loves their birthday and it's my last child free one so I'd like it to be something special. Over the course of this week I've tried hinting about it to my baby's father, because while we aren't in a formal relationship, we live together Friday-Monday every week so we can learn to co parent, establish ourselves as a pairing, learn how to work with each other in the same space, etc- trying to do the right thing for baby. Since we're together over the weekend and my birthday is on Saturday, I'd kind of thought we'd do something. But through all of my prompting and trying to make the plans myself, he's shown absolutely no indication that he remembers my birthday at all. 

I don't want a big, showy birthday. I tried setting plans to go to the museum and maybe for a coffee. Low budget and super easy! But immediately after me trying to set those plans he tells me he's going to see his father and sister on Saturday for the day instead. I know he's been having issues with his dad so I guess it's important. I guess what I'm saying is I'm hurt he doesn't remember, at the bare minimum. He is not the kind of man to surprise me, or pretend he doesn't know for whatever fun reason. 

Do I bother reminding him? Should I let him know it's my birthday, or should I just take myself out to the museum and for coffee and let him be? 

Sorry if this is a bit of a stupid question. I just don't really know what to do. ",2,1740155047.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

I got interested on fact-checking the common knowledge on how the paper filters remove coffee oils. I always automatically answer ""yes they do"", but now I'm trying to find something more precise or meaningful than that. 

I read everything I could find and posted my findings [on r/mokapot](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1iuswdx/paper_filters_and_filtering_the_oils_in_coffee). But I only found info related to the filtering part, not absorption for example.

Still left with questions like:

1. Which oils are going to be more or less filtered? Particularly interesting are the diterpenes linked to high LDL, which seem to be a bit larger particle
2. But, to what extent does particle size (molecule/chain) matter?
3. To what extent does filtering (and absorption for cloth/paper) affect the outcome?
4. Are there experiments or anyone that tried to measure this stuff in some way beyond what I found?",3,1740154950.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False
1iuus0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanganaySupportGroup/comments/1iuus0d/naburnout_dahil_kay_tito/,Na-Burnout dahil kay Tito,"***BACKGROUND***

* Walang pamilya tito ko, namumuhay mag-isa sa dating bahay ng nanay ko kung saan sila pinalaki. Yung tito ko, hindi mabubhay ng wala ang nanay ko. Naka-depende sa kanya buong pagkabuhay niya kapag nagkakasakit, kailangan ng extra pera, iniimbitahan sa mga okasyon (christmas, new years) or ordinary days kasi mag-isa lang talaga siya.
* Nakapagtapos ng college, hindi naman mahirap ang pamliya ng nanay ko. Pero nung nagkaroon ng kanya-kanyang buhay ang magkakapatid, at siya nalang natira sa pamilya, pinabayaan niya ang kanyang sarili.
   * Nagkaroon lamang ng trbaho tito ko dahil sa conections ng tatay ko sa mga kakilala niya. Kung wala parents ko, ewan ko nalang kung makaka-survive siya.
* Recently, nagpatayo ng bahay (studio type) mga magulang ko sa lote ng bahay namin para malapit.
   * Noong natapos, hindi muna niya ito tinirhan for almost 4 months. Nalungkot nanay ko kasi ayaw ng tito ko tumira, sa pinagawang bahay sa kanya.

***MAIN PROBLEM***

Recently, nalaman ko na pina-bloodtest ng nanay ko tito ko dahil may iniinda siyang sakit, na baka UTI raw. Upon checking his lab result, normal urinalysis and normal kidney profile on bloodchem (I work as a medtech).

Sa ilang araw na nandito siya ganto ang kanyang eksena. Tulog buong araw hanggang tanghali. Kakain, tapos manonood ng TV mula tanghali hangang gabi. Minsan naiiwan pang bukas ang TV pagkagising ko ng umaga. Nalaman ko nalang sa tatay ko na pinag-resign pala ng nanay ko tito ko. So basically tambay.

***Lista ko nalang mga kinakainisan ko***\*:\*

***LIVING ROOM***

* **Tambay buong maghapon** para lang manood ng netflix at disney+ sa bagong biling TV
   * Hindi niya pa tinitirhan bagong gawang bahay sa katabi lang namin dahil wala itong wifi para sa TV na nakalagay doon
      * Bumili ako ng wifi extender para doon na siya nanonood
* ***Naninigarilyo***. Kunakapit amoy niya sa buong living room ng amoy niya kaka-yosi.
   * Yung Upos ng yosi, naka-kalat lang sa bakuran
   * Ako ang nagwawalis ng bakuran kahit isang halos dalawang lote ito.
* **Kung saan-saan nakasabit ang kanyang pinaghubaran na tshirt,** kaya nangangamoy buong bahay ng singaw niya.
* Hindi makapag-pahinga ang aking tatay after work sa sala dahil nandon tito ko.
   * Hindi niya lang masabi kay nanay, pero ramdam ko na gusto niya lang mag-unwind sa sala.
   * Kami nagbabayad ng subscription ng netflix at disney+ para sa magulang namin na makapagrelax sa kama after work.
* **Libre na ang pagkain, kuryente, tubig, wifi PERO DI TUMUTULONG SA GAWAING BAHAY.**

***KITCHEN AREA***

***CR***

* Pagkauwi ko galing work, napansin ko na wala sa lalagyanan toothbrush ko.
   * Tinanong ko tito ko **anong toothbrush gamit niya, sabi niya yung DILAW (TOOTHBRUSH KO)**
   * Hindi ko ma-comprehend bakit siya gagamit ng personal na gamit sa isang bahay na nakikitira lang siya.
   * Ginagamit deodorant ng babae kong kapatid.
* Pagkauwi ko rin galing work, ambaho ng CR. Yun pala may **sabit-sabit ng kanyang t\*e yung toilet bowl.**
   * Kung hindi ko pa sasabihin, hindi niya to malilinisan, at maiiwan na nakabukas ang gripo sa cr.

***OTHERS***

* **Malagkit buong sala, kitchen, at terrace, yun pala natapon ang kanyang kape** sa kitchen at terrace.
   * May mga coffee stains mga parte ng bahay na natuyo dahil hindi niya ito pinunasan
   * Yung iba pinahiran niya lang ng tuyong basahan.(Hindi basa)
      * so natira parin ang coffee stains at malagkit ang buong bahay.
* Nililinis ng tatay ko ang buong bahay at garage bago siya pumasok sa opisina.
* Ako ang nauuna umuwi after work, so lahat yan nadatnan ko. Umiyak ako out of frustration at sinimulang linisin ang buong bahay ng umalis tito ko (napansin niya sigurong galit ako ng madatnan na ganon ang bahay)
* **Nakikita niya na ako naglilinis ng aming lote, pero siya nakatingin lang.**
   * Nagsabi pa nga na ""ang hirap walisin niyan kuya noh? dami kasi eh).
   * Alam mo na palamg mahirap walisin bat di ka tumulong?
* For now **hindi siya naglalaba,** For sure nanay ko ang maglalaba at magsasampay ng kanyang mga damit this weekend.
* **Nagsinungaling din siya sa akin about sa work** niya na ""undertime daw siya sabi ng kanyang officemate""
   * After 3 days, Nag-message din sa akin ang kanyang TeamLeader bakit daw undertime and hindi pumasok ng mga ilang araw that week.
* *Kaming Lima sa bahay = Nagttrabaho, ginagawa ang responsiblidad sa bahay*
* *Tito ko = Palamnunin, Tambay, may sariling tagalinis ng kalat.*

***CONCLUSION***

* Hindi ko siya pinapansin at iniiwasan ko siya. (Alam ng tatay ko yung resentment ko sa tito ko). Parang stranger lang sa bahay ganon.

I got to 28 years old and still didn't sleep with anyone, in spite of the many occasions I had.

But therapy helped me to feel more safe around men that are interested in me and before getting into a stable relationship, I wanted to gain some sexual experience. And I met a pilot, that was the captain of my flight in September. He was 36 and very charismatic, handsome and nice. We had some drinks and I told him I want to gain some experience (he said he is looking for flings). So I did it with him. No pain, no fear, I felt very good and I wanted to do it all the time with him.

In December he opened up to me. He drank a bit too much and spent the night at my place. He started crying and said he is married and feels terrible because he has a toddler at home with disabilities. He said he feels guilty for using me to ease his pain, and wanted to stop our thing.

I didn't want to continue either but I felt like a little teenage girl and I guess I fell in love with him. I never told him this though. I didn't want to be the home wrecker.
We stopped seeing each other. And yesterday he texted me (so 2 months later) that he wants to see me this weekend. Just to talk to me because he feels guilty and the situation at home with his little son is depressing.

I said fine, but just talk. I didn't agree to meet at my place. Just a coffee place. ",0,1740154651.0,AITAH,30,0.45,False

1iuunfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1iuunfm/you_can_use_muffins_to_proselytize_i_must_preface/,You Can Use Muffins to Proselytize (I must preface this only pertains to evangelical Christianity),"Yesterday was National Muffin Day! Sorry this is one day late. Oops. Well, have a muffin now if you wish. Besides, every day can be muffin day if you believe it to be so.

Anyway, I wanted to introduce a new method for the evangelical Christian movement to use for their insistent (and frankly annoying) proselytization of their faith to the innocent bystanders just trying to live their lives and mind their business. Walking up to random strangers who do not want to have an interaction with specifically you at that moment in time is awkward for everyone. Especially when you open up with the zinger, “If you were to die today, where do you think you would end up?” Everyone loves to talk about death on the street corner, particularly the minute details of eternal damnation and the judgement of God. Fun times all around. They also love being told that, in God’s eyes, they are an absolutely reprehensible person and deserving of hellfire because there was one time as a kid where you stole your friend’s favorite GI Joe figure and lied about it. You deserve to burn alongside mass murderers and child molesters. Yay.

BUT, of course, there’s a way to avoid this (frankly, excessive and unfair) fate! You can accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and ask him to forgive you of your sins. Do you want to do it now? Please, c’mon, just pray the prayer, the magical prayer, so we can say that we at least got one person and can go up on stage and get congratulated in front of the congregation. Please? PLEASE?!?!?!

Obviously, such an interaction usually ends in either a polite and longsuffering rejection or an eager debate with someone well-versed in either their personal flavor (denomination) of Christianity or science. The occasional person, the kindest ones of all, will go ahead and entertain the people preaching to them and pray with them. And, so very rarely, someone will genuinely believe the message and join the cult-I MEAN, church and experience their life change for the better (maybe, hopefully. I hope so.) But, as you can see, the failure rate is extremely high. Unfortunate that so many souls should be damned to hell because social convention dictates that you probably shouldn’t insist that your religion is the only way to eternal paradise. That’s kind of messed up, no?

SO, instead, begin your conversations with the simple question of whether the person likes muffins or not. If the person says no, please leave them alone, they clearly do not want an interaction with you. However, if they say yes, then you can hit them with the theological argument that muffins prove the existence of God.

Now, the foundations of my argument are shaky and stupid, but they’re funny, so. This conversation that I am creating is purely for the entertainment of the person receiving the evangelical Christian message rather than the conversion of people to evangelical Christianity. This will not result in converts. You MIGHT make some new friends though, and that’s, honestly, more fun.

Anywho, my theological dissertation that muffins prove the existence of God begins with the simple fact that muffins are incredibly delicious. In a cheat breakfast, if I’m not having pancakes, a double chocolate or chocolate chip with some kind of fruit (blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, banana \[side note, bananas technically are berries!\] etc.) elevates breakfast to an absurd degree. A cup of coffee, some eggs, and the holy grail of the muffin at the right-hand corner of the plate as the rising sun streams in through the window is akin to the experience of praying and singing hymns in an enormous, beautiful cathedral. Fantastic muffins deliver religious experiences. And who is associated with religion? Well, God, obviously. God is associated with all things good and positive in the world that happens in evangelical Christianity, so he’s also responsible for the transcendence that occurs in every bite of that breakfast muffin you received freshly baked by your loving grandma that morning. He’s a good God of good muffins. (Say amen please, you have to say amen.)

Additional support for my argument comes from the story of Christ’s miracle of the five loaves and two fishes. Mark 14:14-21 (KJV) states,

^(15) And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

^(16) But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.

^(17) And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.

^(18) He said, Bring them hither to me.

^(19) And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

^(20) And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

^(21) And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.

Jesus took five loaves of bread. Bread can be a lot of things, especially in today’s world. The line between muffins and cake has long been debated, but for the sake of my argument being valid, we shall label muffins as breakfast bread. Now, Mark does not specify what *kind* of bread that Jesus distributed among the people that day. It could have been leavened or unleavened, sweet or unsweetened, white or whole grain, etc. And while historians, linguists, and theologians will argue that muffins cannot be assumed from the text because it would have been anachronistic for the time period, I argue that since Jesus was God, he could do anything that he wanted to do. He could have made muffins out of five loaves of bread if he really wanted to because he was God. And because God is a good God, and muffins are good, God could have decided to distribute muffins to the people for them to appease their hunger on that fateful day. It also explains why the people wanted to crown Jesus as king after this miracle so badly. I, too, would want to make any man, woman, or non-binary person the leader of everyone if they could miraculously distribute muffins to the masses. The interpretation of the text in this manner, therefore, is valid and should be considered doctrinal canon in all of Christianity, not just among evangelicals. Thus, all attempts to proselytize should begin with,

""“Can I tell you about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and how His kindness and goodness brought about the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of double chocolate chip muffins?”

No converts, unfortunately, will be made, but many smiles will be produced, much laughter will be had together, much goodwill produced with such an absurd interaction, and (much to the evangelical’s delight) will stump and own the atheists.

Now, I will be expecting my PhD in Theology from Harvard in the mail within the next couple of weeks for this phenomenal and exquisitely argued dissertation.

*June 26, 2023*

I guess it’s time for me to come clean. Not because I feel too bad for what I’ve been doing, but because it’s possible my eldest son is on to me.

I have 3 kids and a wonderful wife. For more than 25 years our family has loved doing puzzles together. Since we started, I’ve done something that may seem unsavory to people that don’t understand the joy of putting in that final piece. To ensure it was always me, whenever we start a new puzzle I take one of the pieces and hide it in a green sock that’s at the bottom of my dresser. Whenever we get to the very end, we all, once again, lost a piece. We all search frantically until I’m the hero who finds it.

Well, this past Sunday we got to completion once again, only this time there are TWO pieces missing. We begin searching. It may be my imagination but my eldest son gave me a look. It was a half smirk. I think he’s on to me.

Derek, if you’re reading this, I have more patience than you do. I’ll hold my piece forever if I need to. “Find” yours first, and let’s end this madness…

A fellow Reddit user PMd me an incredible idea. I’m going to try and contact the manufacturer and order his missing piece. I’m going to “find” it when it arrives, then “find” mine immediately after. I almost feel bad when I consider how truly confused he will be. Thank you Spockhighonspores!

I don’t think he’s found this thread yet because he hasn’t approached me about it, so this could still work. I’m so excited! This will go down in family history.

*June 27, 2023, 1 day later*

Well folks, I’ve been duped. I got up this morning, went into the kitchen to get some coffee and as I walked past the puzzle I noticed that it had been completed. All pieces accounted for. I calmly, and politely knocked on Derek’s door and asked him about it. He denied knowing anything about it. Like, super convincing. I went down back down to my bedroom, confused as ever and just sat in bed with a blank stare. My wife asked me what’s wrong, and I told her that the puzzle was completed and I have no idea how it got done.

She literally started laughing like a damn hyena… “IVE ALWAYS KNOWN ABOUT YOUR DUMB GREEN SOCK” I’m in shock. I’m numb. Like a damn gut punch. So as it turns out, she’s known what I’ve been doing for at least 10 years. She said she loved watching me walk around thinking I was some criminal mastermind tricking everyone, and that’s why she never said anything. She wanted me to have my win, while she secretly laughed and had her own fun in secret.

I don’t even know what to say. I’m just processing everything. I cannot believe she’s had this over me for so long and I literally had no idea. She noticed a decade ago that I had just 1 green sock, since I lost its pair forever ago, and immediately knew something was up with it since I refused to throw it away. I guess that makes sense. I’m an idiot.

I’ve come to the realization that she’s actually the master here, it’s her house, and I should be thankful she lets me live in it.

At least she promised not to tell the kids.

1iuum0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iuum0g/sudden_cruelty_from_previously_kind_and/,Sudden cruelty from previously kind and compassionate grandmother,"My grandma’s health has been deteriorating over the years, and recently it’s gotten worse. I was really close to her as a kid, but then when I was just finishing up high school she decided to go back to her home country permanently so I haven’t seen her much in the last 6-7 years. 

I did see her briefly last year, just for a few days each time, when I was on exchange in a nearby country. And she was like she’s always been, kind and grandmotherly. Over the years there have been a few times she gotten upset over something innocuous, something not even related that she then goes on a tangent about and blames people. My mum was present one of these times and was horrified. But these incidents were few and far between. 

Now, with 6 months of free time before I start the next chapter of my life, I figured I would come visit for longer given that she likely doesn’t have much time left. I came with a plan of getting my own place in the city, and visiting her in the countryside often. I hadn’t found a place yet when I arrived, so I figured I’d look while I’m here. 

I got here and was shocked by how mean she’s become, almost 24/7. Any little thing can upset her and you never know when it’s going to happen. She’s completely berated me, saying things like “you’re weak”, “you don’t know how to do anything right”, calling me names, telling me to go to hell. Sometimes I’ll feel that she’s having a good day and try to have conversation with her. But often it just devolves into her complaining - often blaming “The West” for anything that’s going wrong in the world or in her house. Or telling me that I’m not allowed to talk, that what I have to say doesn’t interest her. Or just fully ignoring me. She’s said some crazy things like women shouldn’t be in positions of power, that Fair-trade coffee and other ecological labels on products mean it’s GMO, that governments are going to start putting worms in products. I keep my mouth shut and don’t argue with her about these topics. But anything can trigger her, like asking a simple question. Or not understanding something she’s saying (I speak her language but I don’t know every word or how everything here works). And it’s not just me she gets mad at, it’s my grandpa too. And she’s become hateful towards the cats that live outside. Not like abusing them, but the way she talks about them is so mean. And she was telling me how one cat that was here when I was a kid got injured in a fight not long ago, and she didn’t want to pay a vet bill so she just let him die slowly. 

Anyways, that’s been going on for just over a week now and I don’t know how much more I can take. Today she left me in tears and I don’t often cry. I finally found a place to rent but not until March 1st. It’s hard to talk to anyone because 1) it’s a small house out in the countryside so she’d hear everything and just get madder (she understands basic English) 2) the time difference is pretty big. 

So I just feel so alone and sad. And honestly the worst part is that these horrific things she’s said and total lack of empathy and warmth have now begun to cloud the happy childhood memories I’ve had of her. I don’t want to remember her this way. I just don’t know what to do. My family back home (the other side of my family) says I should just leave and return home. But I’d feel like a failure and this would just weigh heavy on me the rest of my life, this unresolved conflict. Not to mention I spent a lot to come here and I’ve already signed an agreement for an apartment. 

I’ve also talked to my mum about it and she recognizes that it’s tough but says it’s fully understandable because she’s in chronic pain. Is this normal for older people in chronic pain? Has anyone else had experiences like this?",1,1740154491.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
