But what stayed is the absolute inability to keep any form of a sleep rhythm. My anxiety is lower, I am way less stressed, way less energy crashes, but that also disrupted my cortisol/ circadian rhythm, because it‘s unusual after being dependant on high doses of caffeine via coffee for years..

I‘m really not sure what to do and how to restore my circadian rhythm. I never had this problem that bad. When I wanted to pull an all-nighter to „reset“ it, in the past I could easily do it by drinking 15 cups of coffee and other stimulants, now the stimulants are gone, which is great, but I‘m just saying I can‘t pull all-nighters anymore cuz I always fall asleep in the afternoon already when I try, and now I literally sleep at random times, rhythm non-existent. And I also never had this problem that bad because I‘d guess the caffeine regulated my circadian rhythm, and helped me manage it.",1,1731816516.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1gt57ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1gt57ct/early_november_iceland_detailed_trip_report/,Early November Iceland Detailed Trip Report,"Early November Iceland Trip Report

I planned this 6 day trip using everyone's suggestions here on Reddit.  Here is my detailed trip report of our 6 day, 5 night (no kids) trip in Iceland.  Hope it helps someone!

**Tips:**

Get the waterproof pants!  Make sure your jacket is actually waterproof and not water resistant.  The day we were at the glacier it poured all day, and we were so thankful for our gear.  

We did not need crampons for our trip (Nov 5-11, 2024) but brought them and only saw rain. 

It is true, if you don’t like the weather, just wait 5 minutes.  It changed at the drop of a hat.  

We saw the northern lights twice while there and didn’t do a tour.  Used a great app called “My Aurora Forecast & Alerts”  which has a lot of really nice features including KP index, cloud cover, webcams and best locations. It was very user friendly and easier to work with than the Icelandic weather page.  

We wanted to do some laundry in Vik, but we couldn’t find anything (hotel staff also didn’t know where we could get some washing done) and my husband ended up washing some socks and a shirt in our hotel room in Vik.  

We always paid in Icelandic ISK when given the choice by credit card because the conversion rate was better on my CitiBank Card than they offered with the conversion.   

We didn’t convert any money.  Paid with a credit card everywhere.  

Cut our flight close because we didn’t realize there was still passport control to go through after getting to our gate area when we were leaving.  The security lines were very long but getting to the airport 2 hours early (after returning the rental car) gave us literally just enough time to get to our gate which included sitting for a bite to eat for about 15 mins.  

**Day 1 - Reykjavik**

Arrived 6am on a red eye flight

Checked in online with Blue rental car.  Got a Kia Sorrento with all the insurance. Check in would have been a breeze and we could have collected our key from an automated lockbox, but I apparently never finished the online check in process.  We waited for about 2 mins, and then were given our key and instructions to where the car was. Blue has a helpful website I bookmarked and they sent an email alert when there were wind alerts.  Blue was excellent, no hidden fees and apparently are the same company as zero and one woman there said she preferred zero because they were a bit cheaper.  

We hit up Kokulist Bakery about a 5 minute drive from the airport and it was delicious. The pecan pastry and ham and cheese croissants were our favorites.  

We had made an 11am appt at Sky Lagoon reservation and drove to Perlan and waited for it to open at 9am.  We did the ice cave exhibition and it was a nice place to kill some time but if we didn't need to kill time we probably wouldn't have gone.  The coffee shop opened at 10 and it was really nice to sit down in the dome and go outside and see the views.  

Sky lagoon was perfect.  We splurged for the private changing rooms since they didn’t have 11am availability for the cheaper shared changing rooms.  We went back at the end of the trip and again splurged for the private changing since we were a couple and could use our 1 bag and 1 changing room together.  

We stayed at Holt Art Hotel which had an old school study kind of feel to it.  Extremely nice staff.  Rooms were basic but clean in a great location.  Breakfast was a nice traditional Icelandic spread.  

Had apps and a drink at Kol a short walk from the Hotel and the food was maybe the best we had all trip.  The duck taco and Icelandic Burrata were our favorites.  It was pricey, but comparable if not a bit cheaper than where we live in Jersey because of not tipping in Iceland.  We didn’t have a reservation, but a Weds in November we were able to just walk in and they sat us no problem.  

My husband lost his wedding ring in Reykjavik (he made a separate post on that) and the hotel as well as staff at Kol were wonderful when we called that evening after realizing it was lost.  

**Day 2 - Golden Circle**

Thingvellir National Park, Gullfoss Falls then to Geysir Hot Springs.  Everything was crowded and the weather was terrible for us. If I had it to do again, I would budget 2 hours if it's a nice day for Thingvellir, walk the big loop and see both waterfalls. Watch out for speed cams in the park.  30 mins for Gullfoss Falls and an extra 15 or 20 mins to wander the gift shop and grab a coffee or hot chocolate. For Geysir hot springs I would have liked to have an hour.  Since the geysir erupts every 8-10 mins, it's nice to have time to sit and hang out and wait.  There are also a bunch of trails and other attractions besides the main geysir you can walk to, and 2 gift shops there.  Also keep in mind you are driving about 45 mins to Thingvellir from Reykjavik and another 45 to Gulfoss from there.  

On recommendation we made a reservation at Friedheimar, a tomato greenhouse with a restaurant in it.  Just that morning someone told us it was the highlight of their visit.  However for us, it was underwhelming. I love tomatoes, but I think I am a bit spoiled from Jersey heirloom tomatoes. Seeing the greenhouse and dining in the greenhouse was a very cool experience and the bread was fantastic, but I would not recommend having a big meal or making a reservation. Sitting at the bar for a drink would be my recommendation.  

We then headed to Kerid Crater which was the highlight of this day.  I feel like people skip this and I wouldn't. 

We stayed at The Bella Apartments & Rooms that night in Selfoss. The feel was college dorm room above a coffee shop. Check in was all digital by code.  2nd floor is rental rooms, and 3rd floor was apartments.  It was a bit of an odd setup, but the room was clean (but super bare), staff in the coffee shop were nice and the breakfast there the next morning was really good.  



**Day 3 & 4 Vik**

Next day we drove to Vik and hit up all the waterfalls along the way:

Ægissíðufoss waterfall  - totally recommend this!  It is a couple mins off the beaten path down a horribly potholed dirt road but we were the only ones there and it was such a nice waterfall!

Seljalandsfoss Falls - we were able to walk behind it in Early November!

Gljufrabui (right next to Seljalandsfoss)

Skogafoss Falls 

We wanted to do the hike to Kvernufoss waterfall (down the street from Skogafoss) but the weather was terrible. From what I read it's about a 30 min hike on a well marked path to the waterfall.  

We had dinner in Vik at Strondin Pub.  Service was slow and food was marginal pub food.  

Stayed in the Black Beach Suites for 2 nights.  Our room had a kitchenette and a nice couch.  The radiant floor heat as well as the radiator heat in the room were controlled by the front desk and apparently couldn't be adjusted for each unit.  Despite reaching out to the front desk on 3 separate occasions our floors never got warm in the bathroom and we were constantly cold.  It was disappointing that we splurged on this hotel and ultimately couldn't really enjoy it because we were cold.  We asked for towels and then after hours of waiting went to the front desk and they gave them to us, and a couple hours later towels then arrived on our doorstep.  The kitchenette was well stocked with coffee pods, a kettle, microwave, pots/pans and a dishwasher.  However we had to dry our wet clothes with the hair dryer because there was no radiator to hang anything on or a drying rack, unlike other places we stayed.  The views were phenomenal and the room was beautiful, but we just didn’t have a great stay.  We were in room 31 so maybe it was just an issue with our room.  

We did the lava show in Vik which we thought was totally worth it.  We did the Katla Ice Cave Tour with Arctic Adventures and it was phenomenal.  There were 11 people in our superjeep, which was a converted Ford Van with massive tires and suspension.  The drive to the glacier was about 30 mins, the whole tour  was about 3 hours.  We did the first tour available at 10am, and by the time we got off the glacier many more super jeeps had arrived and it was getting crowded.  

We had Dinner that night at Surdur Vik. Great meal, fantastic desserts.  

We did some shopping at Icewear in Vik.  Highly suggest popping in and having a look around!

We had coffee at School Beans, (coffee shop in a bus - didn’t get to meet the asshole cat) and hit up Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach.  

**Day 5 & 6**

We drove to Hveraherdi and stopped at Kaffi Krús in Selfoss for a coffee and some fried brie.  Stayed at Frost & Fire Boutique Hotel. Loved the location and since the weather was crummy we did a bit of walking around in the geothermal area behind the hotel across the river.  Room was small but clean with a great little balcony overlooking the river and thermal area.  There was a drying rack for your clothes, a radiator heater we could control as well as wonderful radiant heat floors in the bathroom we could also control.  

We had dinner that night at the restaurant in the hotel.  Food was super swanky with smaller portions.  The lamb and beef tenderloin were really good, but if the weather was nicer, we would have ventured out into town for some food.  Without alcohol our bill was expensive and it didn’t feel worth it.  Breakfast was good.  

On our last day we hit up Sky Lagoon again since we would have to drive close to Reykjavik anyway on the way to the airport.  Got a 11:30 time slot (11am was all booked up) and left by 1:30 to return our rental car and make our 5pm flight.

We are both the same major which is rather small at our school and we made two friends Polly and Olivia and were a great group of 4. The day before may finals freshman year, Jenna decided to tell me she didn’t want to live with me junior year. That is totally okay I understand that, what I don’t understand is why she went behind my back to recruit Polly and Olivia to live with her and now I have no one, but they keep telling me I can’t be upset nothing is set in stone with the 3 of them.

Well over the summer they signed a lease and didn’t tell me, I found out through one of our other friends Arya. Arya was a great friend to me and wiped my tears until I found out she had been telling the other 3 things I didn’t say. I never said I hated them I never said I was going to drop them and I never said they were awful people (although now all 3 of those are true lol). 
Jenna Polly and Olivia ended up getting upset with me one week because I went home three weekends in a row and when they asked why I said I have lots of stuff going on at home and I am honestly not the happiest here. They ended up blaming themselves and they asked me “well you keep saying you are sad here how do you think that makes us feel?” I tried to explain to them that I have other stuff happening and I am still trying to get over what they did last year but it is hard and I am disappointed things don’t feel normal for me yet 6 months later. Jenna yelled at me for 25 minutes about stuff Arya told them I said which I never did! I tried defending myself until I realized these girls don’t want to believe me. So I packed up my shit and drove home and stopped sharing my locations and snap stories with them because after the way Jenna spoke to me I never see a friendship there again. We ended up not speaking for 2 weeks and she broke down crying apologizing to me about the way she spoke to me and when I told her she didn’t care she kept crying and then when I said this friendship is over she has proven she doesn’t give a shit about me and I listed like 4 specific things she did. There’s other details I’m leaving out to maintain anonymity but they did some really fucked up  things and then gaslighted me to not be upset.
Anyways, our third roommate Lauren agrees with me and thinks I did nothing wrong confiding in Ava my feelings (not talking shit) bc i said the same things to lily and she says I never said anything bad. Essentially breaking up with Jenna means breaking up with our 4 other nursing major friends and it just sucks. But Lauren is moving out to study abroad before winter break and I was thinking I should do the same thing but not tell Jenna because I don’t care to live with her anymore. Not one of those girls even checked on me to make sure I was okay in those 2 weeks and I just don’t want to be involved w girls like that. We were a group of 10 at first and they did this to 4 other girls before it was me. 
Aitah if I move my shit out, like take the fridge coffee pot, decorations, cart, mirror, etc. and don’t give her any warning so she comes back to a completely empty room? Or do you think I’m giving her exactly what she wants?

For all but the last 2 years I did farm-scale vermicomposting outdoors in Oklahoma. We raised egg-laying chickens, too, so the worms’ main diet was chicken litter, hay & straw, coffee grounds (from the restaurants where we sold our eggs), egg shells, sawdust, and coffee chaff from roasteries. They got about 100-120 gallons of coffee grounds a week. We also composted a good amount of kitchen scraps. 

However, we sold our farm & moved across the country (Puget Sound) to a suburban location. I have 7 stacking bins that I use a little unconventionally—I’ll post about it when I get a minute. 

A few weeks ago I bought a used Lomi off of Facebook marketplace & love it for so many reasons. It lowers the moisture in the bins so well, eliminates fruit flies inside, and is much more pleasant to store & to feed (not goopy or smelly). It also does a pretty good job at crushing eggshells. 

But I’m having trouble figuring out when the worms have eaten everything & are ready to be fed again. Right now I’m gauging it by the bedding, but the Lomi concentrates the food waste so much (80%) that it seems like the bedding is disappearing while there is still food waste present (worms are heavily clustered in the feeding area & immediately below). Obviously, I need to be adding more bedding with a feeding, but I’m still not sure how to gauge it.

1gt51po,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldercare/comments/1gt51po/need_input_on_an_idea_i_have_for_a_nonprofit/,Need input on an idea I have for a nonprofit,"I've been my mom's primary caregiver since 2020. I cared for my dad for a month in 2019 while he was transitioning, until he died in 2020. I've learned so much throughout this process, and I feel like I've aged at least ten years. My mom is now under hospice care at home, but I'm still providing the majority of her care, and I'm literally hanging on by my fingernails at this point, which brings me to the purpose of this post.

My mom had a friend visit her today, and as I opened the door, she tried to hide her obvious shock over my raggedy appearance. It was almost 2pm, and I hadn't even looked in the mirror, let alone brushed my teeth or fixed my hair. I was braless, wearing raggedy shorts and a stained t-shirt, and I was holding a broom, a measuring tape, a garbage bag full of wet adult diapers, and some room spray. It was obvious from the look on her face that I looked like an absolute fright, but once we got over it, I led her through the extremely unkempt living room and through the even worse dining area and kitchen into my mother's spotless, clean smelling and lovely oasis of a room which I had spent the morning deep cleaning and organizing, in addition to changing her diapers, her clothing, her bedding, fixing her hair, massaging her with lotion, and just joojing her up for her visit. After I got them settled, I realized that I hadn't yet eaten or even had coffee, so I brushed my teeth, dragged a comb through my hair, splashed some water on my face, popped an adderall, and made myself some oatmea and coffeel. As I was choking down my food, I realized that this friend of my mother's hadn't even asked me how \*I\* was doing as she made a beeline to my mom, ready to show her with hugs, and gifts, and how are yous.

Now before you launch into what a selfish a-hole I am, I'll just say that I love my mom dearly, and she deserves every bit of love and care that she gets. (which is a LOT) But this all got my gears turning and I realized that NOBODY CARES FOR THE CAREGIVERS! And often times, it's the caregivers who need it most! Sure, there are lots of support groups and organizations that provide respite info., and tips on self care, etc., and I can't speak for all of you, but the daily ""hang in there"" and ""I wish I could be there to help"" calls and texts just don't cut it. And  most of us are either too exhausted to network with other caregivers, or too exhausted to shower, let alone drag our asses to Great Cuts, (my hair is something similar to a mullet and a mohawk) or to call some organization for aging on the phone only to get transferred 20 times and having to repeat why you're calling 20 times, only to get transferred one more time before you get disconnected.

What we really need is an organization that can provide the actual care! Right? Because, I don't know about y'all, but because I haven't been able to work, and my mother has no retirement savings, we're barely surviving on her monthly social security check, and we are broke ass broke. I mean, digging quarters out of the couch broke. But I am in such desperate need for some pampering, that I would sell my soul right now for a massage, or a pedicure, or even for someone just to play with my hair for 30 minutes. It's been so long since I've received any care or direct attention that whenever someone does say a kind word or gives me a hug, the tears are right there at the edge of my throat, and I have to struggle to keep them at bay, because if I start to cry, I fear I may never stop!

So maybe not right this moment, but eventually, I would love to start a nonprofit organization to provide free self-care and wellness services to low-income caregivers, using a pre-established network of health and body care professionals in my area such as massage therapists, aestheticians, Reiki practitioners, acupuncturists, chiropractors, yoga instructors, life coaches, hairdressers, colorists, nail techs, makeup artists, personal stylists, and even clothing stores and boutiques that may want to donate clothing. Most businesses and practitioners benefit from offering a certain amount of pro-bono work per year, not only from a business standpoint but from a personal philanthropic standpoint, as well. So I would start out by contacting these people (in person if and when possible) to explain my mission and see if they'd be interested in participating by donating their time and services, and/or even becoming a board member.

I would then have to come up with a user-friendly application system and max income guidelines to determine eligibility for services. And also a lot more, but this is the general idea.

What I'd like to know is are any of you aware of similar organizations that exist? If so, can you point me in their direction? Also, would YOU be excited to know that such an organization existed in your area? If so, would you feel comfortable applying? And lastly, do you agree that caregivers are under-appreciated, overlooked, and underserved? If not, can you explain why?

I would really appreciate any and all feedback - positive or negative (please try and be nice though, as I'm very fragile at the moment. LOL) Thank you in advance for your input!

1gt50hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1gt50hk/xanthines_too_much_of_a_good_thing_maybe/,"Xanthines: Too much of a good thing, maybe","Right, so. I've been experimenting with xanthines (caffeine analogs) for the past month or so and so now I feel confident about adding a review to the commons. There's not a whole lot about these substances out there beyond marketing fluff. But caffeine is godly so its analogs have potential, don't they? Well, they do. And more.

But first, I'll get something out of the way: it's surprising, but the last thing these compounds provided were productivity gains. Maybe it'll be different for you, but they were quite useless as nootropics. This doesn't mean they're useless *in general*, but that's what my experience was.

With that said, I'll start by reviewing the ones I've tried individually:

>Methylliberine (Dynamine)

> Doses tested: 100mg, 200mg

> Brand: Nootropics Depot

Not worth it. Even with high expectations potentially leading to a placebo effect, I was just disappointed with it. It DOES work, but it's way less powerful than you'd think. The effects start kicking in at 15 minutes, peak at the hour mark and then they kind of just fade away. The thing is, the effects aren't that strong. There's a small mood boost for that duration and that's it. I can't even compare it to a known quantity of coffee because I've gotten actual euphoria from 75mg of caffeine before. Useless on its own, basically. Also, very finicky and tolerance builds insanely quickly. I got two non-consecutive uses out of it before having to put it away for a week.

> Theacrine (Teacrine)

> Doses tested: 100mg

> Brand: PureNootropics

This, on the other hand. It's the real deal. Well, not REALLY on its own, but it still holds up by itself. It's like methylliberine above, except it lasts longer. And is stronger. I noticed increased wakefulness, a bit more focus (not that strong so mostly useful for working out), a subtle but certainly appreciated stimulating effect and general well-being. I liked it, honestly. 100mg worked so well that I didn't bother to increase the dose on its own. Definitely feels more sustainable than even caffeine itself, since it doesn't even have a comedown. It just fades away.

> Theobromine

> Doses tested: 800mg, 1600mg

> Brand: Nutricost

Completely and utterly useless. Does literally nothing. Avoid at all costs.

Also, unfortunately, I have not tried paraxanthine. I do want to try it in the future, but after the theobromine bust I feel a little bemused by the thought.

Obviously, though, the main draw of these substances is not JUST about using by themselves. It's the synergistic effects between them and caffeine, and even between themselves. So here goes:

> Methylliberine + Caffeine + L-Theanine (my preworkout/caffeine source has L-Theanine, so I'm going to count it from now on. It's an incredible substance on its own and it probably affects the results a bit, but whatever)

> Doses tested: 100mg of methylliberine + 100mg of caffeine + 100mg of L-Theanine; and 100mg of methylliberine + 200mg of caffeine + 200mg of L-Theanine

Eh. Didn't really do squat. I halved my dose of caffeine initially expecting the methylliberine to kick it back up a notch, but it didn't really do that. So I mostly felt the methylliberine and the caffeine went unnoticed. I was really dopamine depleted those days though, so who knows. But considering how meh methylliberine is on its own, I wouldn't place much stock on it getting radically better even during perfect conditions.

> Theacrine + Caffeine + L-Theanine

> Doses tested: 100mg of theacrine + 200mg of caffeine + 200mg of theanine

Oh boy. Again, theacrine is everything methylliberine says it is and more. It had one big, big effect: the stimulant peak from caffeine lasted twice as long. Considering how hard it affects me sometimes, that's a GIGANTIC difference. The time I tried it, I ended up wired for almost three hours. And I don't just mean 'awake', I mean STIMMED. I was really jittery, energetic, felt GREAT both mentally and physically, and still somehow had very little anxiety throughout the experience. I'm usually knocked out by the time I finish my workout, but that day I still felt powerful and energized when I got home, when I took a shower, and even after I went to college. However, it does have one weird side-effect: there's an actual comedown. It's not AWFUL and it's not super obvious (except in retrospect), but I did notice increased anxiety levels as my energy started dissipating. This lasted about 15 to 30 minutes and then I went back to normal. Maybe even a little tired, but not overwhelmingly so. Gets my Seal of Approval.

> Theacrine + Methylliberine

> Doses tested: 100mg of theacrine + 100mg of methylliberine

It doesn't do much. Maybe it's my fault for expecting too much of it, but it basically feels like theacrine except it only takes 15 minutes for the effects to kick in. Also completely useless for productivity: I got an initial euphoric kick from the methylliberine and theacrine mixing together, but then it faded away and it left me feeling normal. Hell, maybe even a bit more scatterbrained than usual. Not the greatest mix, in my opinion.

So, at this point you're probably wondering what's up with the title, right?

That's because of what happened when I mixed the three xanthines together. It was an absolutely wild ride. Fair foreword: keep in mind the side-effects of the three different combos, because they ALL showed up afterwards, and even more so.

> Theacrine + Methylliberine + Caffeine + L-Theanine + Vitamin D3

> Doses tested: 200mg of theacrine, 200mg of methylliberine, >200mg of caffeine, >200mg of theanine (I overfilled an scoop), 10K IU of vitamin D3

It looks really stupid now, typing it all out, but I swear it feels like nothing when you lay it all out physically. 

If you're wondering what the vitamin D is for, it's because it raises my dopamine levels SOMEHOW and makes me either oddly euphoric OR extremely productive. So it's basically a stimulant potentiator. I think you can see where this is going.

It actually went beyond the realm of supplements or nootropics to the point that it felt like an actual drug, so I'll type out my experience as a trip report. 

T+0:00 - I take my unholy concoction as a pre-workout, since I was going to do both gym work and cardio.

T+0:15 - I start to feel the first few effects when driving there, as I start to feel like I can process music better and that makes me enjoy it more than usual.

T+0:30 - I'm working out by this time, so it diminishes the stimulant effects. I'm actually a little bit disappointed, since I've had more insane effects from a dose of 100mg caffeine with no tolerance. Little did I know, I was just getting started.

T+1:00 - I finish my strength work and head out to do my cardio (doing it indoors is for schmucks) when it starts raining hard and my alternative turns out to be closed too. At this point, I'm quite clearly incredibly stimulated since I'm shaking and jittering like a hairless dog in Siberia, along with a sense of urgency that doesn't fit in with the situation. 

T+1:30 - I get home with no further effects to report other than even more increased music enjoyment, so I thought I had hit the peak and that's what I would stay at. Hopped into the shower, and that somehow amplifies the feeling. Every water droplet gives me a small rush of pleasure. At this point, I become incredibly motivated so after enjoying the sensation for about half an hour I finish showering incredibly fast and head to college as fast as I possibly can, rushing my usual routine because I feel like I'm thinking twice as fast.

T+2:00 - All hell breaks loose. I start driving even more aggressively than I usually do, and music starts sounding pleasant to the point that I start getting physical, euphoric sensations from the best parts of each song (warmth throughout my body, tingling sensation coming from my crotch, breathlessness at the glory of sounds, etc.) and generally feel like a living, breathing physical god. Whenever I got calls, I would answer them with uncharacteristic aggressiveness. It's like I couldn't help myself, like a self-fulfilling prophecy that I had no idea about. One song was so incredibly powerful, pleasant and euphoric that the drop made me felt like I had passed some hidden threshold of pleasure far beyond that of normal humans.

T+2:45 - I'm in college by now. I'm still incredibly stimulated, but I start to feel more and more anxious. I didn't realize it at the time, but that was the comedown started. Subjectively and in the moment, the anxiety didn't feel that impactful but I recognize now that it was like I was constantly in the throes of a panic attack, if you know what that feels like. Awful. Since I had a test later that day, I set out to study. And I discovered that I had ZERO focus. I couldn't focus on anything other than being a piece of shit to my friends and looking at random stuff on the internet. I still felt stimulated and jittery, but it was slowly starting to reduce in magnitude.

T+3:15 - The comedown finally starts to end, leading to a small energy crash. Keep in mind I hadn't eaten since breakfast and it was already evening, so that probably didn't help. But the anxiety started to subside, as did my energy in general. I suddenly became hungry as hell but I was also so lethargic that I didn't really feel like getting up to buy food. I did end up doing so in the end though, as I got INSANELY nauseous.

T+8:00 - I STILL didn't feel normal. It was as if I had had a small but subtle perspective shift that was annoying me at the edges of my vision. Other than that, I had no more effects until the morning after.

T+16:00 (The next morning) - Sleeping wasn't hard nor bad. What was weird was waking up. Not because I was abnormally sleepy or anything, but because I started shaking and shivering when trying to go back to sleep (classic hitting the snooze button technique). Odd thing. Other than that nothing else happened other than feeling a bit under-the-weather, but that was to be expected.

Anyways, that was my experience with the supreme combo. I have not tried any hard stimulants nor do I have any interest in ever doing so, but I know people who've done cocaine (and the good, uncut stuff, none of that diluted bs) and they've not reported anywhere nearly as intense as an experience like this. Well, they were also drinking, but still. 

It was *fun* but I was starting to get tired of being that stimulated by the third hour. I will *probably* do it again but it was actually a quite taxing experience and it's something that works best as an occasional treat rather than something you do everyday as part of a pre-workout or something.",2,1731815501.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

Hello, so I recently started doing a routine and working out, and my objective or my dream is to be able to lose fat and build muscle and also abs. Im 19 years old and last time i got weighted i was around 180 or something around that number. IM not going to the gym, so i have a routine at home and with dumbbells that its weight its 15(15x2=30). So what i’ve been doing when not using dumbbells as weight i use my own weight for it. So here comes my doubts and questions:

1. I’ve been following a balanced diet, and cutting sugar (unless its coffee which i use one sugar packet with zero calorie sweetener) and i mostly drink water. I also eat eggs now as for the protein and sometimes i do eat yellow rice with meat but i eat in small portions, if not i’ll eat a greek yogurt. So my doubt is while i’ll still be able to lose fat if im having this diet or not?

2. So my body as of right now, i have a bit of fat on my side abs( and also have man tits but not that much) so my question is regarding abs, if i want to be able to have abs or at least lose the fat on the side. With doing cardio, and my normal workout routine, will I achieve it? or do i need to focus more on that part.

3. So i know, if i want to be able to build more muscle or something, i’ll need to increase my weights. But with all the doubts from before, will i still need to hit the gym for abs to be formed and lose more weight, or can i achieve this dream of mine being at home?

4. Also, this is random doubt and stuff, but how do people get all veiny and stuff in their arms. I know dumb question but is it from doing a specific type of exercise or what?

5. should i focus more on lowering my body fat than on trying to get abs while being in a high body fat percentage? or what?

6. Also, when people say i should engage my corr or squeeze my abs or something like that, how can i do it? Everytime i try i feel like im not doing nothing at all.

Thanks, and sorry for the dumb questions!",1,1731815423.0,workout,0,1.0,False
1gt4z4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1gt4z4v/am_i_weird_for_preferring_the_c_and_d_gate_lounges/,Am I weird for preferring the C and D gate lounges?,"By now I think it's well known that the best Alaska lounge at SEA is the fancy new N gate lounge and the other best option when flying Alaska is the Amex Centurion. However lately, I've been appreciating the smaller, older D and C gate lounges a lot more. And I feel like they’re a little underappreciated.

Because they get all the praise online, I find the N gate and Centurion lounges end up actually being the most crowded. Recently, there's been waitlists and long queues to get into the Centurion lounge. And even once you're in there, you have to wander around for minutes to find an open table or chair. I won't deny the food and drink selection are excellent, but it's become very not relaxing. Because of the location, the Centurion lounge is basically a part of the open-air terminal coupled with the crowding it feels much more hectic and noisier. (Yes, I know I'm also part of the crowd)

The N gate is also decently crowded, although not quite as bad as Centurion. So I've been recently frequenting the D and C gate lounges, which are plenty nice. C gate has great runway views and often the C and D gates end up being my departure gates anyways. And you really can’t beat a one to two minute walk to your gate for convenience.

The C and D lounges are still quite spacious with tons of empty seats and away from the hustle and bustle of the terminal, it's very calm and peaceful. Barista made me a fantastic fall spice latte with oat milk the other day. So the drinks are basically as good as the other lounges with some minor diffs in alcohol. And the food I found more interesting at the C and D lounges recently like having Mexican food, chips and guacamole, or meatballs and loaded mash potatoes.

Finally, because there's less people all the time, the service just seems a little better at the C and D lounges. The baristas are exceptionally good at D and really proactive, like asking me if I want my coffee to go or for here.

So this isn’t meant to be a rant about lounges sucking or being crowded, but I feel like the less frequented C and D lounges have ended up being some of my better ground experiences out of SEA lately.",5,1731815376.0,AlaskaAirlines,4,1.0,False

FreedomCanada made an appearance on Joe Rogan, with many calling the interview groundbreaking and sensational. Following the viral affair, The General quickly made plans of her own to appear on a podcast. The General was reached out to by members of the Nelk Boys, a Canadian youtube group known for their prank videos and political commentary. The group asked her to appear on the Full Send podcast, and she agreed. As it turns out, both groups had availability that same night. This is a transcript of the appearance.*  
Kyle Forgeard: “Alright guys, welcome to the Full Send podcast. Today’s episode we have a very fascinating and interesting guest. Please welcome Brigadier General Hayley Fitzpatrick, leader of the Conservative Party! Known affectionately as The General by her supporters, General Fitzpatrick’s message of economic success and Canadian greatness has resonated deeply with many Canadians such as myself. Today we have her on to talk about her motivation in politics, and to delve more inside the person behind one of the fastest growing political movements in Canadian history.”  
The General: “Thank you Kyle, it’s quite an honor to join you here today. The Nelk Boys are a staple of Canadian culture, and you guys have made some truly hilarious videos. I couldn’t personally be any more proud of the global reach you guys have had, and for how far you all have come since starting this channel and podcast. The Nelk Boys are a true example of Canadian Greatness, and how hard work, dedication and perseverance pay off.”  
Aaron Steinberg: “Thank you for the kind words. Before we get into the more serious questions, I have something that’s been stuck on my mind. What’s your typical Timmie’s order?”  
The General: “Ah, that’s a good question. It really depends on my mood, some days I’ll get two Boston cream donuts and other days its two Canadian maple donuts. No matter what, I always have a hot London fog. I’m not really a coffee girl.”  
Kyle: “That’s surprising, I always thought that was how you had the energy to run all across the  country!”  
The General: *laughs* “No, even as I grow old I still continue to retain the energy and stamina I gained throughout my time in the military.”  
Aaron: “Speaking of, let’s talk about your service. You’ve mentioned before your time in Afghanistan, are there any moments that particularly stuck with for you?”  
The General: “I’ll never forget this moment. This was roughly two years into my deployment as part of Operation Athena. We were involved in a long and gritty battle to repel Talbian forces from a village within the Kandahar province. Operation Athena’s purpose was to secure the north and begin the process of rebuilding the democratic process in Afghanistan. I’ll never forget what happened after the close of the battle and the movement of our forces into the village. While walking the main street, a teary eyed elderly man came up to hug me. In broken English, he said ‘You have given us something your people do not cherish enough… freedom.’ While his statement seems simple at face value, it really stuck with me. It made my service feel even more important, as I was not only fighting for the rights of Canadians, but of those living under oppression globally. This mindset is why I remain committed to Canada being at the front lines in the fight against authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia.”  
Kyle: “Funny you mention that - I kept hearing some nonsense talk about you supporting Russia.”  
The General: *bursts out laughing* “It is nonsense. I’ve always been clear about my opposition to Putin. What I have said however is my opinion on how a resolution to the war should be approached. You would think after all of my time spent in the military the government would recognize my expertise on the matter. Sadly, it seems they won’t listen to anyone but themselves.”  
Kyle: “I’ve noticed that, it seems like they constantly talk down to us voters and scold anyone who disagrees. I remember at the height of the protests this week that the Minister of Finance kept questioning the intelligence of anyone who challenged his plan. It seems like this is a phenomenon on the left.”  
The General: “You’re absolutely right, it is. Throughout their term in government we have seen their members constantly talk down to and belittle anyone who disagrees, even going so far as to attack the integrity of protestors and union members. They are only isolating more of Canada, and the polling shows this. The government should be committed to helping all of Canada, not just those who agree with them.”  
Aaron: “You’re absolutely right. I’ve also noticed a sentiment amongst my personal circle and others that young men feel abandoned and left behind by the government.”  
The General: “I’ve noticed that too. Over the last few years we have seen the left constantly demonize and attack men just for existing, and the phenomenon keeps getting worse. Make no mistake, I am fully in support of women who are seeking justice for being sexually assaulted or raped. However, it seems that men are being attacked and ‘cancelled’ for even attempting to talk to women. I’ve noticed this trend amongst members of the left on social media where they deem all men to be bad and pampered by the government. Mental healthcare has been all but ignored, especially at a time when men are suffering a mental health crisis and loneliness epidemic. I’ve heard firsthand from my nephews and the children of my friends that it is almost impossible for men to find companionship, with many fearing social ostracization if they try to flirt with a woman. We need to do better and stop treating young men like criminals. We need to treat young men like humans deserving of love and compassion. My party is committed to tackling the men’s mental health crisis.”  
Kyle: “The crisis is indeed a big one. Out of every 100,000 Canadians, 17 men and 5 women commit suicide. There is a staggering difference in the suicide rates by gender, and nothing is being done to stop it”  
The General: “Correct, and appearing here is my first step in tackling this issue. To all you young men who feel hopeless for their future and abandoned by the government, I promise you, I will never abandon you. My hope is to restore prosperity and greatness to Canada, and to bring men the mental health care and compassion they need. I want you all to know that my party will always have your back, and we will never dehumanize you even when you disagree.”  
Aaron: “Well thank you General Fitzpatrick, but it looks like we have to wrap up now. Thank you for joining us tonight. It is clear that you are committed to protecting the best interests and wellbeing of the Canadian youth, especially young men.”  
The General: “Thank you guys for giving me this opportunity. I hope to sit down with you two again, but hopefully as the Prime Minister.”

I ordered a bottomless portafilter and a Baristapro nanotech 20g basket from WLL that specifically mentions having larger holes to reduce back pressure, channeling, etc... 

The machine came in and I've been fighting what I believe is channeling the entire time. Specifically, high pressure streams of coffee shooting all over the place, sometimes 6+ inches away from the machine. I expected a learning curve, it's my first machine and I'm clearly needing more experience, but it's driving me absolutely nuts. No matter what I try, the problem continues. Grinding finer/coarser, tamping harder/softer, fresher/older beans, darker/lighter roasts, puck screen, etc... 

I quit worrying about extraction time or anything else, I just wanted a shot that didn't spray a fine mist of coffee in one or more random directions. I kept feeling like the pressure was too high, and checked multiple times to confirm the e24 comes with the 9 bar spring installed. Finally, I was looking at my other baskets and grabbed the gaggia basket that came with the bottomless portafilter. I compared it to the Baristapro basket. The holes in the gaggia basket are noticably larger. I filled it with water from the sink, the water drains out very smoothly. I did the same with the Baristapro basket, the water drips out VERY slowly and awkwardly. 

Finally, I pull a shot with the gaggia basket. It doesn't spray everywhere! I'm happy that I may have solved the spraying issue, but annoyed that it seems to have been wholly due to an ""upgraded"" basket which was supposed to fix the issue.

""As her superiors, we have to be unanimous, and we have to tell her what she's going to be doing, and why."" I exclaimed in anger ""And what about her consent? Nora and I agree to go undercover as dommes, but Ari will probably never trust me, so that leaves Nora, whom she has a weird fascination with, anyway. But we'll be sending my sister as a bottom slave, and we're not even going to get her consent? This is ludicrous, right?"" 

I looked to my left for support, Nora, Sarah, Lara. Then my right Layla, Constance. Grim hard, sad faces. Except for Nora who was smiling a little, though to her credit she looks a little teary eyed. But they don't look like they'll support my dissent. I look back at Dave at the head of the table. He looks as unflappable as usual, if a bit sad like the others.

""Young Lady, we all hate doing this to her. But you heard my man, lives are at stake, supposedly Ari's going to sell fifty of her slaves to snuff film makers in three months.There's no guarantee of rescuing them unless we have operatives in place to work with Ari's turncoats. Ideally that would be Mistresses Nora and Sandy, and their bottom slave Sheila. She'll probably not trust you, Sandy, so it will be Mistress Nora and her lowest bottom Slave Sheila.""

""Ari will never buy that Nora's a turncoat, and we just let her take Sheila as an offering."" Dave replied ""That won't be the game. The story is all of us sold Sheila out out of envy of her success, and greed to use her for profits. I have sources that say Ari's slipping now that her empire is slowly collapsing, she's just crazy enough to believe we're as rotten as she is at the core. Doing this to Shelia makes me think she may be right.""

""But we can't let innocent people die to preserve her freedom and dignity. I vote she stays a slave. We tell her the truth that she's done nothing wrong. But we've voted to keep her a slave for the next three months and do give Nora near total control of her training program, with Sandy as a safety. Nora also has free reign to obtain the slave's ""consent"" by any means she deems fit. Sandy will be the safety and hopefully, be able to accompany Nora and the Slave to Ari's mansion at the appointed time.""

I crossed my arms and looked stubborn. ""Sandy,"" Dave said reasonably ""Do you want Ari to kill those people, and many more because of Sheila's stubborness? You were Ari's slave, what if she decided to ship you off for a snuff film? Would worrying about someone's freedom and dignity be a factor in not rescuing you. I'm firmly convinced it's the lesser of two evils. And I think deep down you are too.""

I sighed and unfolded my arms. ""If I agree to this cockamamie nonsense, what's the plan?"" Dave said ""After we tell Sheila we know she's innocent, we let her know we're extending her slave sentence, so she can accompany our operative Nora as a convincing well trained bottom slave. We let her know lives are at stake. That Nora will have leave to christen her with her new slave name for the next three months. Nora is literally the ruler of her slave world, with leave to train her to unhesitating obedience of her Mistress, because both, maybe all three of your lives may depend on it, Sandy. You do have her ninety percent there, Nora. Your training and molding of her has been some of the best slave training I've ever seen, you are a gifted domme, young lady. But all three of your lives and many more depend on getting her to 100% obedience, and fear of her Mistress. You get drunk and cruel on power quickly, young lady, we're giving you a lot of lattitude and free reign to train her to your standard. Remember when your molding and mentoring her into an mindlessly obedient slave, you have a responsibility to her, Sandy, and a lot of other people to get them out alive. She'll be helpless and depend on you to give the right orders and make the right decisions to keep her alive. Don't forget it. Sandy don't let her forget it.""

She looked giddy with excitement, until she saw me glaring at her. Then she tried to look focused and somber. ""I will."" She said sheepishly. ""Remember that's my sister you're dehumanizing and reprogramming. I'll support you in what's necessary, but..."" Nora gulped, then looked defiant. ""You put her in a bitchsuit too, once.""

""What did you say to me, bitch? I'm not tied up or in a bitchsuit, why don't you say that up close."" I got up and advanced on my blonde friend, fists balled. She looked nervous, but stood up and seemed to try and shift into a stance. Dave said ""Ladies, ladies, take your seats now! This isn't helping!"" Dave's command voice made Nora sit down, and me unclench my fists and back up, then sit down. I noticed Layla getting up to break us up, but Dave waved her back to her seat.

""Girls, take your seats, save it for Ari, not each other. Is there anything else that I need to address before I bring Sheila in?"" The question seemed pretty clear. ""What about Ari's moles?"" I queried.

Now Dave gave a slight smirk. ""One is Dao, we're going to leave her in place until after the operation. The other...I know who they are...I'm not going to tell you yet. I have a plan, ladies, I know you know you can trust me when I say that.""

I wanted to say more but Lara motioned me to be quiet, mouthing ""Trust him"". 

Dave gazed somberly around the table ""Anyone else? We're all unanimous that Sheila remains a slave, and we give Nora more power over the slave then she has now, in preperation for the operation against, Ari?""

We all said ""Aye."" in sad mumbles, except Nora, who mouthed hers enthusiastically. 
""Nora, bring the slave in to face a tribunal of her superiors.""

Sheila was tethered outside the door. We were in an old conference room Dave had swept for surveillance. Dave said he was sure we weren't being surveilled. I hope he is right.

Nora eagerly got up to retrieve the slave. A moment later Sheila stumped in bitchsuited, walking on her elbows and knees, wearing a black hoodmask and ball gag.

Nora had removed her tether and held it coiled in her hand. She had developed such perfect control of Sheila, she could control her to pinpoint precision with verbal commands. 

""Slave, halt. Head up, face your betters."" Sheila's head came up, and for a moment she didn't seem to care much or recognize who we were. Her eyes kept sliding back to try and find her mistress, even though she didn't turn her head back. The priority in her pretty head was obey Mistress Nora, not just her voice commands but reading her moods and non-verbal cues to accomplish what was a first priority for her, nothing else mattered. How could Nora improve on this near perfect example of a thoroughly broken slave? My heart broke and I began to have second thoughts.

Then her eyes cleared and she seemed to recognize us, looking confused. Dave spoke ""Sheila, I'm so glad I can call you that again, but it might be awhile after this. We knew you were innocent and wanted to flush out Ari's moles, we have bigger problems now, lives are at stake. We have to extend your slave time three months, in which we need you to go on a sting operation as a slave with Mistress Nora and Mistress Sandy to save a lot of lives. I'm sorry Nora's reign of terror over you isn't ended, in fact we're expanding her power over you. I know it's awful, but it's for at least fifty lives, and maybe ending Ari's reign for good.

It was horrible to watch hope light in Sheila's eyes at Dave's first words, then turn to horror as he went on. She forgot all about Mistress Nora as she mmmphed at us desperately at us not to do this to her. Even through her ball gag ""'Ut' Na Fawer! Uht Naw Riit!"" was pretty understandable.

Nora drew a wicked metal braided red flogger and whacked her nude rear end so hard old welts started bleeding. ""Bow your head and shut up, slave."" Sheila went quiet and hung her head. ""Do you think if it was good news you'd still be in a bitchsuit? You're  still a slave. I can't believe I used to think you were so smart! Your Superiors have spoken, you're slave opinion doesn't matter!"" Another whack. ""I taught you better then your behavior just now, consider this remediation, stupid!"" Another whack.

""We have a mission to save innocent people, you cunt. That means I have to train you to better obey me. My first order of business is to change your name, you worm. You are now Slave Zero."" 

I spoke up ""Sheila, this is only temporary. Sorry to make you participate in this operation without your consent. This isn't just cruelty for cruelties sake. You're probably going to be one of the most defenseless and vulnerable during this operation. Some of Dave's associates who don't know you might see you as expendable. We don't, which is why we're training you to follow orders without question, and do something even if it's humiliating. Your obedience  might save your life, my life, Nora's life and countless others. It sucks, but it is what is. You're going to be uncomfortable, looked down on and humiliated the next three months. Learning what we're trying to teach you, especially Nora, might save yourself. That's why Nora's in charge, because somtimes, you act stubborn and stupid. Nora's there to teach you and control you. Learn from someone for once, besides Ari."" There I said it. Despite the fact I loved my sister, and hated Nora's excessive cruelty, I'd follow Nora's leadership before Sheila's. And I think the reason they're in their respective positions right now is other people see that, as excessive as it can be, Nora's guidance is good for Sheila.

Lara said ""I love you, sweetie. But I was  serious about what I said in the Ready Room office today.  Right now I'd take one of her over ten of you. Nora's got a lot to teach you. You should learn it while she's your domme."" 

Nora just smiled down at her bitchsuited sub's bare ass, eating up our praise of her and her scorn of Shei-Zero. I know she thought it was her mandate to do what she wanted to the poor Slave. I can't believe  I was about to fight her a few minutes ago, and now I'm ready to give her a hefty check, though not a blank one, to do what she wants to Zero. We have more pressing priorities then her dignity and pride.

Slave Zero's (Formerly Sheila) 

I was in my apartment...Well, Mistress Lara's apartment still in my bitchsuit glumly reading Nora's latest entry on Sheila's Slave Blog. Nora was on the couch, stretched across it, eating a bowl of chocalate ice cream.

The entry read:

Greetings BDSM Fans,

I'm pleased to annonced that Sheila Nguyen Connor has agreed to be rechristened Slave Zero. We went with the new name to distinguish our relaunch from the old Loser Girl Brand. I'm pleased to announce she has been officialy made my personal slave, though it's more a change of title as it was the defacto reality. Sandy O'Keefe Connor is still her lead trainer and my Saftey. I have acquired the title of Financial Manager for the slave and given Power Of Attorney for her paycheck and bank accounts. So she's going to be paying for piercings, slave outfits, and domme outfits and accessories for me, as is only fitting as my personal slave. 

We thank you our fans for making the revival of Sheila's Slave Blog a Stunning Success. 

Some plans for her future
1. Get her a tongue stud, more vaginal piercings and maybe  belly button piercings.

2. Have her perform fellatio on lucky fans in special blog videos.

3. Saftey is paramount, but if it can be assured, make her available for vaginal and anal with select, lucky fan in blog videos.

4. Give us Tattoo recommendations and we'll consider them. We prioritize ass and tits, and above her pubic hair, but we'll consider them for anywhere on her body!

Slave Zero is very excited to support this and any other ideas her beloved fans may have for her.

Nora flicks my ""Christina"" pink lotus pussy piercing and asks ""How do you like the reboot, Zero?"" I grunt with suprise and pain, but mmmph ""I love it, Mistress Nora!"" around my gag. She giggles and says ""No you don't, you're just toadying to me so I don't punish you."" She sighs as I remain silent.

""Sheila, please listen to me a moment as your friend, or at least former friend, not your Mistress. I know this is horrid for you, and believe it or not, I understand. But Ari's getting more brazen and desperate. Both Dave and Lara told me she's never been as indiscrete as to try and ship out fifty slaves before, and all for snuff films! And if she's that vicious and desperate, what is she capable of doing to near peer rivals like us?""

""We're sorry to force you to sacrifice your freedom, dignity, and comfort."" A girly little giggle. ""Well, ok, since we're being honest here, I'm not as sorry as the others, I enjoy domming you, I've gotten more control over you then I did with Sarah or Mary, and it's intoxicating, like a designer drug. And I love the praise for how well I'm molding you into an obedient slave. That's kind of intoxicating, too.""

""But back on topic. I saw the video of you terrorizing Mary and punching and suffocating Constance because they disrespected you. You told Mary you'd help me put a ring through her clit so you could keep your writing job which you loved. So, the stakes now are a little higher, and you're in Mary's place. I will put you through A LOT of indignities to save others lives, and maybe ours. By you're rationale to Mary, we're justified, especially since lives are more important then you ""doing what you love."" She dropped the last four words with obvious mockery. ""Think about it.""

I did. And I really did want to stop Ari. But using me as bait in their little sting without my consent? Just because it was easier to make it look authentic? Okay, I see their point. Ari will check the setup out, the less safties and fucks given for my dignity, the more real it would seem. Fuck, it was so unfair, but would I do the same to one of the other girls with these stakes? I'd like to say no. But Nora rightly pointed out I did something similar to Mary for a lot less.

""Ok, baby, it's been a long day, time to eat my pussy, then we'll call it a night."" I heard her kick off her shoes, than remove her trousers. She grabbed me by the shoulders and brought me up so I was kneeling, facing her, my sleeved stumped arms hanging at my sides like useless wings.

She was bottomless except for cute pink fluffy socks. The little blond leaned forward and kissed my forehead. When she leaned back, my eyes dropped to her little blond pussy. I felt resentment that SHE didn't have any uncomfortable and sometimes painful piercings on her pussy. Of course, I knew the piercings were about asserting her control over me.

""You lewd thing, you can't wait can you?"" She undid my ballgag, put it aside, then pushed my head towards her slit. ""You know what to do by now, Zero. Mistress likes to focus that cute half breed tongue on her clit. I wonder how that's going to feel when we get you your tongue stud. Bet it will enhance your blowjobs."" I said nothing, having no permission to speak. I smelled her musk, already very aroused, and extended my tongue to flick my Mistress's clitoris.

Sarah's perspective 

Poor Slave Zero. I really wish I had deleted that text where Lara and I joked about Mistress Nora making her eat laxitives, then Sheila looking desperately at her for permission to so much as fart, permission that would be denied.

Nora read my texts, which is her right as my domme. I normally don't worry, because I have nothing to hide. But she saw the texts of Lara and I joking around about it and thought it would be a 
good idea.

Sandy fought it, with backup from Constance. Sandy got kicked out of both their offices for disrespect after barging in screaming at them about it. Constance tried to be more reasnably appeal to our Boss and her Domme.

It was a no go. Dave And Layla agreed it was cruel and unfair. But that was the point of Nora's training to mold Sheila into Zero; teaching her that her job was to obey, no other considerations outside of saftey mattered, not for her. It didn't cross that line so they wouldn't veto it. To protest, Sandy suspended takeout deliveries to the Ready Room for the day.

So Zero was naked except for a zippered mouth bondage hood, zipped shut over a nerf ball. She was kneeling in front of a chair, each arm tied at the wrist to the chair with Nora's padded zip tie cuffs. Wedged between her legs was her bathroom bucket.

Nora had spoon fed Zero a rather pleasant breakfast of Oatmeal with brown sugar and blueberries. After her slave was finished eating, Nora gleefully informed her she had mixed laxitives in with the Oatmeal as she zipped her mouth shut.I admit her wide horrified eyes as her superior zipped shut her mouth made me giggle a little. Constance just looked disgusted by the cruelty of it. That sobered me up and brought me back to reality.

Nora told her slave that she could not release her bowels without permission from Nora. Dave, Layla and Lara would accept no appeals from Zero, or on her behalf. Nora had the final authority over her slave's bowels. Zero's punishment if she failed was an ass whipping and chewing from Mistress Nora. And she got no lunch, no snacks, just water; she wouldn't eat again until supper.

Lara was scouting out locations for outdoor shoots. I think she really didn't want to face the conflicted  feelings of saddness and loss of respect for her love that Nora's degredations caused her. 

Nora was nominally in charge of us today, as Layla was with Dave, working with his ""contacts"" on just how to stop Ari a few months down the road. She slapped a script down open on the seat of the chair with Zero's part. It was just an expendable bitchsuit slave caught in the crossfire during a battle. But Nora always insisted the enslaved Sheila perfectly memorized her parts. The slightest imperfection was a minimum of a harsh scolding.

We sat down and started going over our parts and discussing our scripts. One thing I'll say about Lara, she was more open to suggestions about what our characters would or wouldn't do, she would let us line out dialogue and insert our own revisions, and was open to discuss changes. She didn't always change her script, but she never got irritated by respectful pushback. Sheila listened and took some feedback, but often acted like the gentelest pushback was offensive.

Nora was in good boss mode with Constance and I. We'd halt our readings for engaging discussions on the script, and what we would suggest Lara revise. Nora was respectful despite her temporary authority over us, engaging in the discussion as equals, and gently directing us back to reading, when she felt we'd spent to long on one particular plot point. It disturbed me she knew how to lead without  being a tyrant, yet still enjoyed being so cruel when given leave to do so.

It was easy to forget about poor Zero, she was so quiet, trying to desperately memorize her part to perfection to please her Mistress. Until we were quietly reading and we heard a mmmphed ""Mistwess Ora, weese...."" Mistress Nora didn't even look up from her draft script. She casually sipped a cup of coffee before deigning to answer her slave's plea. ""Hold it, slave, you do not have permission to go. You better have that script memorized perfectly, Zero.""
Quiet, the slave obeyed⁰m her domme.

A half hour later, desperate grunts and groans, another muffled plea. A quietly reading Nora tried to ignore her slave. When she couldn't anymore, she yelled ""Shut up, Zero."" Quiet.

Fifteen minutes later, more grunts and groans, no pleas. This time, Nora picks up her crop and whacks it hard on the table. ""Don't test me, slave!"" She hollers. More silence.

A few minutes later, the unmistakable sound of bowels letting go, then a mmmphed ""Weese, uh twied, uhm sowy, Misswess Ora! Mewcy!""

I knew from the look in Nora's eyes as she got up wielding the crop that her  slave was getting no mercy from her. As Sheila pleaded for leniency and the first whacks on her bare ass sounded, I ran to the door in tears without asking to be dismissed. My love and Mistress turning into a monster and my wonderful best friend so degraded. I knew it was life or death stakes, and probably the only way, but it was too much for me today.

I heard Constance yell ""Sarah and I are taking our break, Mistress Nora."" Nora gave her dismissive permission while whipping her slave and ordering her to be quiet.

I ran out of the Ready Room and into the Ladies room down the corridor. Constance caught up to me braced against one of the sinks, sobbing. She turned me around and hugged me, stroking my hair as I cried on her shoulder. ""There, there, Sugar. I know it's hard now, but there's always light at the end of the Valley of Shadow. It'll all be ok."" I hugged my black friend, wanting it to be true, but not believeing in it.

Chapter 1: The Announcement

Chief Science Officer Zyx'tal's sensory membranes fluttered in distress as he reviewed the morning's research proposals. His crystalline exoskeleton chimed softly as he double, then triple-checked the document before him.

""Dr. Madison Hughes,"" he chittered into the lab's communication system, ""please report to my office immediately. There must be an error in your survey proposal.""

The human female appeared moments later, her dark hair pulled back in what she called a ""ponytail"" - a detail Zyx'tal had initially mistaken for a symbiotic organism. She wore the standard expedition uniform, modified with numerous ""pockets"" that humans inexplicably required.

""What's up, Chief?"" Madison asked, casually dropping into a chair designed for Meldorian physiology. Zyx'tal winced at her disregard for the delicate crystalline furniture.

""Dr. Hughes, according to this proposal, you intend to personally survey the Kax'thal volcanic region... on foot?""

""Yeah, standard geological survey. Should take about three days."" She pulled out a small device and began tapping at it. ""The portable sensors give better readings than the hoverpods, and there's some interesting formations I want to examine up close.""

Zyx'tal's translator must be malfunctioning. ""The Kax'thal region has surface temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. The terrain is unstable, the atmospheric pressure is 1.2 times your Earth standard, and there are toxic gas vents throughout the area.""

Madison looked up from her device, blinked, and smiled. ""Sounds like Arizona in summer, minus the gas vents. Don't worry, I packed extra water and a good filtration mask.""

""The last research team that attempted to study Kax'thal lost three hover vehicles to the terrain!""

""That's why I'm going on foot. More maneuverable."" She pulled out another device - her ""phone"" - and showed him some images. ""Look, I mapped out a route that follows the old lava tubes. They're pretty stable and will provide shelter if needed.""

Zyx'tal's crystalline structure nearly vibrated with anxiety. ""Dr. Hughes, as your superior and as someone who has come to... appreciate your species' contributions to our scientific endeavors, I cannot in good conscience-""

""Already got approval from Central Command,"" Madison interrupted, showing him another document on her device. ""They're pretty excited about getting some detailed readings from the region. Besides,"" she grinned, showing her teeth in that disconcerting human way, ""what's the worst that could happen?""

As Madison left his office whistling something called a ""hiking tune,"" Zyx'tal made a decision. He would document this expedition thoroughly. Either it would serve as a cautionary tale about human recklessness, or... well, he had learned never to underestimate these deathworlders.

He activated his personal log: ""Expedition Note, Day Zero: I believe I am about to witness either the most impressive or the last field survey of Dr. Madison Hughes. May the Crystalline Harmony preserve us all.""

 Chapter 2: Preparations

Zyx'tal found himself outside the expedition prep room early the next morning, his crystalline form reflecting the purple dawn of their research outpost. Inside, he could hear Madison Hughes humming as she packed her gear.

""Dr. Hughes, I've brought you the standard emergency beacon array,"" he announced, entering the room. He stopped short, his sensory arrays struggling to process the scene before him.

Madison stood amid what appeared to be organized chaos. Her ""backpack"" - a primitive cargo carrying device - was being stuffed with equipment that made Zyx'tal's safety protocols scream in protest.

""Thanks, Chief! Just add it to the pile."" She gestured vaguely toward a collection of gear that would have overloaded a small cargo lifter. ""Though I probably won't need it.""

""What is... that?"" Zyx'tal pointed at a small metal container Madison was filling with water.

""Oh, this? Just my coffee maker. Can't start a day without coffee."" She patted the device affectionately. ""French press. Simple, reliable, and makes a great cup.""

""You're bringing a toxin synthesizer into a hazardous environment?"" Zyx'tal's translator actually crackled with distress.

Madison laughed. ""Coffee's not toxic! Well, okay, technically it is, but humans have built up a tolerance. Besides, the caffeine helps maintain alertness during long surveys.""

Zyx'tal watched in horrified fascination as she continued packing: climbing gear (""just in case""), first aid supplies (worryingly extensive), something called ""trail mix"" (apparently dried organic matter for consumption), and various scientific instruments that she had modified herself.

""Dr. Hughes, I've taken the liberty of preparing a detailed risk assessment."" He transmitted the document to her tablet. ""There are precisely 847 ways this survey could result in your immediate termination.""

Madison glanced at the document while adjusting her boots. ""Only 847? Huh, better odds than my last expedition in Death Valley."" She stood up, shouldering the enormous pack with disturbing ease. ""Look, I appreciate the concern, but this is pretty routine stuff. I did my thesis work in active volcanic regions back on Earth.""

""You... you studied in conditions like this... voluntarily... before?""

""Sure! Though Iceland had better weather. Usually."" She checked her wrist device. ""Oh hey, we should grab breakfast before I head out. The cafeteria is serving those purple fruit things today - they taste just like pancakes!""

As they walked to the cafeteria, Zyx'tal made another log entry: ""Preparation Note: The human continues to display characteristic species disregard for personal safety. Most alarming is her intention to consume neural stimulants before entering a hazard zone. Have updated risk assessment to 848 potential fatality scenarios. Addendum: She appears to be looking forward to this.""

In the cafeteria, Madison cheerfully loaded her plate with portions that would feed three Meldorians, explaining something about ""carb-loading"" for the journey. Zyx'tal noticed several other alien researchers maintaining a respectful distance, their own sensory arrays vibrating with a mixture of horror and fascination.

""Oh, by the way,"" Madison said between bites, ""I added you as my emergency contact. Standard procedure.""

Zyx'tal's crystalline form briefly lost its structural integrity. ""I... I am honored?"" he managed to reply.

""Great! Well, time to hit the trail. Don't worry if you don't hear from me for a few days - the magnetic fields in the region mess with communications.""

As she strode out of the cafeteria, pack bobbing with each step, Zyx'tal realized he had no choice. He quickly transmitted a message to Central Command: ""Requesting permission to establish remote observation post for duration of Dr. Hughes' survey. Purpose: Scientific documentation of human research methodologies.""

The response was immediate: ""Permission granted. Priority level: Maximum. Note: Maintain safe distance from human subject at all times.""

 Chapter 3: Into the Field

From his carefully positioned observation post three kilometers away, Zyx'tal watched through high-powered scanning equipment as Madison Hughes began what she had termed a ""nice morning walk."" The sun had barely risen over the volcanic wasteland, and already the temperature was climbing past what most species considered survivable.

""Field Observation, Hour One,"" he recorded. ""Subject Hughes has maintained a steady pace of 5.2 kilometers per hour across terrain that would shred most environmental suits. She appears to be... whistling.""

Through his viewer, he watched as Madison paused to take readings near a gas vent, casually adjusting her breathing mask while toxic fumes swirled around her. She pulled out a collection device and, to his horror, leaned closer to gather samples.

""The human's environmental suit appears grossly inadequate,"" he noted. ""Correction: Subject Hughes is not wearing an environmental suit. She is protected only by what she calls 'hiking clothes' and basic filtration equipment.""

Madison's voice crackled over the emergency channel. ""Hey Chief! These gas readings are amazing. The sulfur content is off the charts. Reminds me of that time I worked Yellowstone's thermal vents.""

""Dr. Hughes, my scanners indicate the ground temperature where you're standing is 67 degrees Celsius.""

""Yeah, my boots are starting to get a little toasty. Good thing I brought the heat-resistant ones."" She moved away from the vent, making notes on her tablet. ""Though I did forget my favorite hat. Getting a bit of a sunburn.""

Zyx'tal's crystalline structure vibrated with anxiety. ""A sunburn? You're experiencing radiation damage?""

""Just a little pink. Nothing some sunscreen won't fix."" There was a pause, followed by some rustling sounds. ""Oh wow, check this out!""

The scanner showed Madison climbing down into what appeared to be a partially collapsed lava tube. Zyx'tal's risk assessment algorithms nearly overloaded.

""Dr. Hughes! The structural integrity of that formation is highly questionable!""

""Nah, it's fine. These tubes are like nature's tunnels. Been forming them the same way for millions of years."" Her voice echoed slightly. ""Besides, it's cooler down here. Perfect spot for lunch!""

Zyx'tal watched in disbelief as Madison sat down in the ancient volcanic formation, pulled out her ""sandwich"" (a strange layered food construction), and began eating as casually as if she were in the base cafeteria. She followed this with the promised coffee ritual, which involved boiling water using the heat from a nearby thermal vent.

""Subject appears to be using geothermal activity as a cooking source,"" he recorded. ""Consuming food in an environment that registers as lethal on seven different scales. Currently... taking selfies?""

""Hey Chief, want a picture? The bioluminescent bacteria in here make for great lighting. Kind of reminds me of that cave system in New Zealand, except less water and more lava.""

As Madison continued her lunch break, describing various other lethal environments she had visited with disturbing enthusiasm, Zyx'tal added to his log: ""Most concerning is not the human's presence in this environment, but rather her complete lack of awareness that anything about this situation is unusual. Have begun to suspect that Dr. Hughes' definition of 'routine' may require significant academic review.""

The rest of the afternoon consisted of Madison methodically mapping the lava tube system, collecting samples, and occasionally stopping to point out what she called ""neat rock formations."" Each time she discovered something new, her excitement levels appeared to increase, despite the deteriorating environmental conditions.

""Just think,"" her voice crackled over the comm, ""we're the first ones to scientifically document this system. Well, first ones on foot, anyway. Those hover vehicles barely scratched the surface. Sometimes you just have to get your boots on the ground, you know?""

""No,"" Zyx'tal responded quietly to himself, ""I most certainly do not know.""

 Chapter 4: The First Crisis

As the planet's twin suns began to set, Zyx'tal's sensors detected the first tremors. Minor seismic activity was common in the region, but these readings were escalating rapidly.

""Dr. Hughes,"" he transmitted urgently, ""my instruments indicate an imminent geological event. You must evacuate immediately!""

""Oh yeah, I felt that,"" Madison replied casually. ""Don't worry, it's just a precursor. The big one won't hit for another twenty minutes or so.""

""You... you can feel the seismic activity? And predict its progression?"" Zyx'tal's crystalline structure vibrated in harmony with the tremors.

""Sure! The pattern's pretty similar to what I studied in the Ring of Fire back home. See, when you get this particular sequence of small quakes, followed by that specific harmonic resonance..."" She continued explaining while calmly packing her equipment.

The ground suddenly heaved violently. Zyx'tal's observation post, despite its stabilization technology, swayed alarmingly.

""Dr. Hughes! Status report!""

Through his viewers, he watched in horror as the lava tube Madison had been exploring partially collapsed. For eleven terrifying seconds, there was no response.

""Wow, that was a bit closer than I expected!"" Madison's voice finally crackled through. She emerged from a narrow crevice, covered in dust but apparently unharmed. ""Lost my favorite sample collection tool, but got some amazing readings! The crystalline structures that formed during the collapse are incredible.""

""You... you're injured!"" Zyx'tal noticed a dark liquid running down her arm.

""Oh, this? Just a scratch. Had worse from my cat."" She pulled out her first aid kit, casually dabbing at a wound that would have required immediate medical evacuation for most species. ""Though I might have cracked a rib when I dove under that outcropping. Nothing serious.""

""Nothing... serious?"" Zyx'tal's translator struggled to convey his incredulity.

""Yeah, ribs heal pretty quick. Besides, check out these seismic readings! The way the magma chamber is responding to the tectonic stress is fascinating. This could revolutionize our understanding of this planet's geological processes!""

Zyx'tal watched as Madison, still bleeding and presumably with damaged internal support structures, began setting up additional sensors around the collapse zone. She moved with only a slight favoring of her left side, continuing to talk excitedly about magma flow patterns and crystallization rates.

""Field Log, Critical Incident Report,"" he recorded. ""Subject Hughes has survived a level 6 seismic event with minimal protection. Injuries that would be fatal to 82% of known sentient species appear to be causing only mild inconvenience. Most disturbing is her immediate return to data collection rather than seeking medical attention. Beginning to suspect humans may have evolved on a far more hostile world than previously theorized.""

""Hey Chief,"" Madison's voice interrupted his recording, ""any chance you could send down a drone? I've got more samples than I can carry now, and these new formations are too good to leave behind.""

""Dr. Hughes, standard protocol requires immediate evacuation following injury in the field.""

""But the seismic activity has actually improved our access to the deeper geological layers! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"" She paused. ""Well, once-in-a-lifetime on this planet, anyway. There was this one time in Guatemala...""

Zyx'tal sent the drone, if only to prevent her from attempting to carry more weight with her damaged ribs. As he watched her cheerfully loading rocks into the drone's cargo compartment, he added to his log: ""Update: Human pain tolerance and risk assessment protocols appear to be inversely proportional to perceived scientific value of discovery. Requesting immediate revision of all human research safety guidelines.""

 Chapter 5: Coffee Break

Dawn of the second day brought new horrors for Zyx'tal's observation log. Madison had set up what she called a ""base camp"" in a relatively stable section of the lava tube system, and was now performing her morning ritual.

""Field Log, Early Morning: Subject Hughes is deliberately consuming her daily toxin despite injuries sustained yesterday. Most alarming is her insistence that she 'can't function' without it.""

""Want some coffee, Chief?"" Madison's voice crackled over the comm. ""I packed extra. Though you might need a different filtration system given your crystalline structure.""

""You are offering to share your poison?"" Zyx'tal's horror transmitted clearly despite the interference.

""It's not... well, okay, technically it is a poison, but it's a really useful one!"" She held up her metal container to the camera. ""This batch is special - Hawaiian Kona. Saved it for field work.""

Through his viewers, Zyx'tal watched the bizarre ceremony unfold. Madison heated water using a portable device (having decided the thermal vents were ""a bit too sulfuric"" for proper coffee), ground what appeared to be roasted beans, and performed a careful extraction process that seemed at odds with her usually casual approach to hazardous materials.

""The temperature gradient in this tube is perfect,"" she commented, sipping from her container. ""Helps the coffee cool to just the right temperature. Though I might need to relocate soon - my instruments show increasing activity in the magma chamber below.""

""Your injuries from yesterday-""

""Already feeling better! Human bodies are pretty good at patching themselves up. The ribs are just a dull ache now, and the cut's already scabbing over."" She rotated her shoulder to demonstrate, then winced slightly. ""Okay, maybe a bit tender still. Nothing the coffee won't help with.""

Zyx'tal adjusted his scanners, focusing on Madison's vital signs. To his amazement, her body was indeed showing remarkable repair progress. Even more startling was the effect of the coffee: her neural activity, metabolic rate, and energy output all increased markedly after consumption.

""Field Log Addendum: The human toxin appears to function as a performance enhancer. Subject's cognitive functions and physical capabilities show measurable improvement following ingestion. This suggests humans may have evolved to not only survive poison but to derive benefits from it.""

Madison interrupted his observations by standing suddenly, her attention focused on her instruments. ""Well, break time's over. These readings suggest we've got about two hours before this area gets really interesting. Time to move to higher ground!""

""Define 'really interesting,'"" Zyx'tal requested, already dreading the answer.

""Oh, you know, possible lava flow, probable gas vents opening up, definite seismic activity. The usual."" She began packing with practiced efficiency, somehow managing to secure her precious coffee maker despite her injured ribs. ""Don't worry, I've got a perfect observation spot mapped out. The view's going to be amazing!""

""Dr. Hughes, perhaps this would be an appropriate time to consider-""

""No evacuation needed, Chief! This is exactly the kind of geological event we came to study. Besides,"" she grinned into the camera, ""I've got plenty of coffee left, and the best data always comes from being right in the middle of the action.""

As Madison shouldered her pack and began navigating toward what she assured him was a ""totally safe"" observation point, Zyx'tal added one final note to his morning log: ""Beginning to suspect that human definition of 'safe' may be fundamentally incompatible with universal standards. Also, requesting immediate research funding for study of human biochemistry, specifically their ability to weaponize botanical toxins for personal enhancement.""

Through his viewers, he watched as Madison began climbing up a near-vertical rock face, coffee container somehow still in hand, humming what she called a ""hiking tune"" despite the increasing tremors and toxic gas vents surrounding her position.

 Chapter 7: The Main Event

The observation team had grown to twelve scientists from various species when the magma chamber finally decided to demonstrate its power. Madison, naturally, was delighted.

""Oh wow, this is going to be epic!"" Her voice crackled through increasing interference. ""The pressure readings are off the charts. Definitely better than my grad school fieldwork in Krakatoa!""

""Dr. Hughes,"" Zyx'tal transmitted urgently, ""our calculations indicate a 94.3% probability of catastrophic volcanic activity within the next seventeen minutes.""

""Seventeen minutes? Perfect! Just enough time to get closer and set up the high-speed cameras. This is going to look amazing in the presentation!""

The assembled scientists watched in collective horror as Madison, instead of retreating, began moving toward the most active zone.

""Field Log, Critical Situation: Subject Hughes appears to be intentionally approaching the eruption site. Have confirmed human brain patterns are within their normal range, suggesting this is rational behavior for their species.""

""You guys might want to back up your observation post another few kilometers,"" Madison advised cheerfully while setting up equipment. ""These pyroclastic flows can be pretty spicy. Though not as spicy as my roommate's chili back in college. Now that was lethal!""

""Did... did she just compare volcanic death clouds to food?"" asked a hovering plasma-based researcher.

""The human's vital signs indicate she is experiencing what they call 'excitement,'"" noted a medical observer. ""Their endocrine system appears to be releasing pleasure chemicals.""

The ground suddenly heaved violently. A massive fissure opened up barely thirty meters from Madison's position, spewing superheated gases and molten rock.

""Now that's what I call a data point!"" Madison shouted over the roar. ""Hey, anyone want to calculate the ejection velocity? I'm betting it's at least... oh crud.""

The 'oh crud' made even Zyx'tal's crystalline structure vibrate with anxiety. It was the first time he'd heard Madison express anything close to concern.

""Dr. Hughes? Status report!""

""Small problem. Remember those really cool crystalline formations we found yesterday? Well, their bigger cousins are kind of... surfing... on that lava flow. Heading this way. Pretty fast.""

Through their viewers, the observation team watched as massive crystal formations, carried by rivers of molten rock, careened toward Madison's position.

""Fascinating geological process, though,"" she continued, hastily packing her most important instruments. ""Never seen anything quite like it. Well, except for that time in Yellowstone when... actually, story time later. Gotta run!""

""Run?"" Zyx'tal's translator struggled with the concept. ""The nearest safe zone is 7.2 kilometers away!""

""Better get moving then! Don't worry, I did track in high school. Plus, you know what they say - you don't have to outrun the lava, you just have to outrun... wait, that's bears. Never mind!""

The observation team watched in astonishment as Madison began what she called a ""tactical retreat"" - sprinting across unstable terrain while dodging volcanic debris, still somehow managing to collect samples and take readings.

""Field Log, Emergency Addendum: Subject Hughes is displaying previously undocumented human mobility capabilities. Speed, agility, and decision-making appear to be enhanced by proximity to death.""

""Look on the bright side,"" Madison's voice came through between breaths, ""at least it's not raining! Though that would actually help with the ash situation. Fun fact: humans can breathe through wet cloth in ash storms. Learned that one in Pompeii - the modern city, not the ancient one. Though that would have been cool too!""

As the observation team scrambled to relocate their equipment to a safer distance, Zyx'tal added one final note: ""Beginning to suspect that human educational institutions may be significantly more hazardous than previously believed. Request immediate study of Earth's 'grad school' survival rates.""

 Chapter 8: Marathon

The situation had deteriorated significantly. Madison's ""tactical retreat"" had been complicated by the arrival of a research team of Venusian scholars who had ignored evacuation orders to study the unprecedented geological event. Now trapped by advancing lava flows, the Venusians' environmental suits were failing in the extreme conditions.

""Dr. Hughes, please confirm you are proceeding to the evacuation point,"" Zyx'tal transmitted, his crystalline form vibrating with anxiety.

""Slight change of plans,"" Madison replied, her breathing heavy but controlled. ""Got some Venusians here who could use a hand. Or tentacle. Whatever.""

""The Venusian team is three kilometers in the wrong direction!""

""Yeah, noticed that. Don't worry, I've got this. Though I wish I'd packed my good running shoes. These boots aren't exactly made for sprinting.""

The observation team watched in disbelief as Madison changed course, running toward the trapped researchers rather than away from danger.

""Field Log, Crisis Update: Subject Hughes is now intentionally returning to the hazard zone. Behavior consistent with previously documented human 'heroic stupidity' syndrome.""

Madison reached the Venusian team, who were huddled behind a rapidly heating rock formation. ""Hey folks! Lovely day for a run, right? Hope everyone's up for some cardio!""

""The human appears to be making jokes while surrounded by lethal conditions,"" one of the observers noted. ""Again.""

""Their environmental suits are compromised,"" Zyx'tal transmitted. ""Venusians cannot survive in their current location for more than seven minutes.""

""No problem!"" Madison's voice was alarmingly cheerful. ""I've got some repair tape in my first aid kit. Works on spacesuits, kayaks, and that one time I had to patch a shark cage. Long story.""

The observation team watched as Madison quickly patched the worst leaks in the Venusians' suits. Then, to everyone's horror, she began strapping their equipment to her own pack.

""Dr. Hughes, you cannot possibly carry-""

""Sure I can! Did way more than this during Ranger School. Though usually with less lava. Usually."" She helped the first Venusian to its feet-analogues. ""Okay folks, here's the plan: we're going to do a nice, easy jog to that ridge over there. Think of it as a fun run, just with more deadly gases and flying rocks!""

""The human is attempting to escort four Venusians through an active volcanic event,"" Kr'thak observed. ""While carrying their equipment. And making jokes about it.""

""Previous injury status update?"" another scientist inquired.

""Subject's ribs appear to still be damaged from yesterday's incident,"" Zyx'tal confirmed. ""She appears to be ignoring this fact.""

Through their viewers, they watched as Madison led the Venusian team across the hazardous terrain, constantly encouraging them with what she called ""motivational speeches.""

""Come on, you're doing great! Just pretend we're at one of those obstacle course races. Though those usually have more mud and less magma. And hey, at least there's no burpees!""

""What is a 'burpee'?"" one of the Venusians managed to ask between labored breaths.

""Trust me, this is better. Though remind me to tell you about this CrossFit competition I did once. Now that was actually dangerous!""

The observation team tracked their progress, noting with amazement how Madison continuously adjusted their route to account for new hazards, all while carrying nearly twice her body weight in equipment and maintaining what she called ""good group morale.""

""Almost there!"" she encouraged as they approached safer ground. ""Just think of the amazing data we're collecting! This'll make a great paper. Working title: 'Running from Rocks: A Hot Take on Volcanic Evacuation Procedures.' Get it? Hot take?""

""Field Log Emergency Addition,"" Zyx'tal recorded. ""Subject Hughes appears to be using terrible wordplay as a survival mechanism. Most concerning is that it seems to be working. Venusian team's vital signs improve slightly with each awful joke.""

As they finally reached the safe zone, Madison immediately began checking everyone's equipment and suits, somehow still having energy to talk.

""That was fun! Though next time, maybe we should pack some marshmallows. Nothing better than victory s'mores after outrunning certain death!""

""There will be no 'next time,'"" Zyx'tal transmitted firmly.

""That's what they said after that incident with the underwater volcano,"" Madison replied cheerfully. ""Speaking of which, anyone up for some marine geology tomorrow? I heard there's some interesting hydrothermal vents just offshore...""

The collective groan from the observation team was audible even through the emergency channel.

 Chapter 9: Medical Mysteries

The medical bay of the research station had never been so crowded. Scientists from seventeen different species crowded around the observation window, watching as Madison Hughes underwent her post-expedition medical examination.

""I really don't need all this fuss,"" Madison protested, sitting casually on the examination table while various scanners whirred around her. ""It's just a few bruises. And maybe a cracked rib. Or three.""

The chief medical officer, a Centaurian named Dr. Vx'lith whose six eyes were all currently widened in disbelief, reviewed the readings for the fourth time.

""Dr. Hughes, you have sustained multiple fractures, second-degree burns, toxic gas exposure, severe dehydration, and what appears to be radiation damage to your epidermal layer.""

""Yeah, forgot my sunscreen yesterday. Rookie mistake."" Madison was typing on her tablet, apparently working on her field report. ""Though the sunburn will turn into a tan, so that's a bonus!""

""Field Log, Medical Observation,"" Zyx'tal recorded from behind the glass. ""Subject Hughes continues to display concerning lack of appropriate response to physical trauma.""

""Oh hey, Chief!"" Madison waved at the observation window. ""Check out these mineral samples I grabbed during the evacuation. The crystalline structure is amazing! Worth a few broken ribs, if you ask me.""

Dr. Vx'lith's tentacles curled in distress. ""You continued collecting samples while injured and fleeing lethal conditions?""

""Well, yeah. I mean, when else are you going to get samples from an active eruption zone? Besides, my other arm was still working fine.""

The medical team watched in fascination as Madison's body actively repaired itself. Cell regeneration rates that should have been impossible were happening right before their eyes.

""Fascinating,"" muttered a Rigellian biochemist. ""The human's cellular structure appears to be adapting to the radiation exposure rather than degrading.""

""Oh yeah, humans are pretty good at that,"" Madison commented, somehow having heard through the supposedly soundproof glass. ""We call it getting a base tan. Though my dermatologist back home would probably yell at me.""

""Your species intentionally exposes itself to radiation for aesthetic purposes?"" Dr. Vx'lith's translator nearly shorted out.

""Well, when you say it like that, it sounds crazy,"" Madison laughed. ""Hey, anyone want to see the footage I got of those crystal formations surfing the lava flow? The camera got a bit melted at the end, but the first part is really cool!""

""Dr. Hughes,"" Zyx'tal transmitted, ""perhaps we should focus on your recovery...""

""I am recovering! Look, I can almost raise my arm all the way now."" She demonstrated, wincing only slightly. ""Besides, humans heal better when we're distracted. It's science!""

The medical team watched in horror as she pulled up the video on her tablet, enthusiastically narrating the near-death experience as if it were a sporting event.

""See that backflip I did over the gas vent? My gymnastics coach would be proud. Though she always said I needed to stick the landing better. Hard to do that when the landing spot is actively melting, am I right?""

""Field Log Addendum,"" Zyx'tal recorded. ""Human pain suppression appears to be directly linked to scientific enthusiasm. Subject shows more distress over damaged equipment than personal injuries.""

""Speaking of equipment,"" Madison piped up, ""any chance I could get back out there tomorrow? Those post-eruption formations are going to be perfect for sampling, and I've still got three days left on my permit!""

The collective gasp from the observation room was audible even through the reinforced walls.

""Absolutely not,"" Dr. Vx'lith declared, all six eyes narrowing.

""Aw, come on! I'll wear extra sunscreen this time. And I promise to avoid any more surfing crystals. Unless they're really cool. Then I'll just take pictures from a safe distance. Like, at least ten feet away!""

Zyx'tal added a final note to his log: ""Beginning to suspect that human definition of 'safe distance' may be mathematically incompatible with known physics. Requesting immediate revision of all research safety protocols, specifically adding section titled 'Additional Guidelines for Human Researchers: What Ten Feet Actually Means.'""

 Chapter 10: Scientific Revolution

The central auditorium of the Galactic Science Academy was packed to capacity. Representatives from over three hundred species had gathered for what was being called ""The Human Incident Review."" Madison Hughes sat in the front row, still sporting visible bandages, typing last-minute adjustments to her presentation.

""Dr. Hughes,"" Zyx'tal chittered nervously beside her, ""perhaps we should mention fewer details about the... alternative evacuation methods?""

""Are you kidding? The crystal surfing was the best part! Besides, it proves my theory about volcanic crystal formation in low-gravity environments."" She grinned, pulling up a slide showing her riding a crystalline formation over a lava flow while carrying three Venusian researchers. ""I call it 'extreme geology.'""

The Academy's Chief Administrator, a gaseous entity named X'thrix, floated to the podium. ""We are gathered today to review the unprecedented findings from what was supposed to be a routine geological survey.""

Madison stood, making her way to the stage with only a slight limp. ""Thanks, Chief X'thrix! I've titled my presentation 'Running Hot: New Perspectives on Active Volcanic Research' - get it? Because of all the running. And the lava!""

The audience's universal translators struggled with the pun.

""As you can see from this first slide,"" Madison continued enthusiastically, ""traditional remote sensing methods miss about 60% of the crystalline formation process. Sometimes you just have to get up close and personal with your research subject!""

The presentation that followed would later be described in Academy records as ""terrifyingly revolutionary."" Madison casually described research methods that violated safety protocols of every known species, while presenting data that transformed their understanding of planetary geology.

""And here's where it gets really interesting,"" she said, showing a video of herself collecting samples while dodging volcanic debris. ""The crystal structures actually respond to seismic vibrations in a way that suggests semi-sentient behavior. I discovered this while using one as a makeshift surfboard during the evacuation!""

""Question,"" a trembling voice called from the audience. ""Are you suggesting that future research should involve... intentionally riding volcanic formations?""

""Well, not intentionally,"" Madison replied thoughtfully. ""But if the opportunity presents itself... I mean, think of the data potential!""

Zyx'tal's crystalline form dimmed slightly as he added to his final log: ""Subject continues to redefine 'research methodology' in concerning ways. However, cannot argue with results.""

""In conclusion,"" Madison announced, showing a final slide of herself giving a thumbs-up while surrounded by active lava flows, ""I propose a new approach to geological field research. One that combines traditional observation with what I call 'dynamic interaction.' Also, I'm submitting a requisition for heat-resistant camera equipment and better running shoes.""

The silence that followed was broken by X'thrix. ""Dr. Hughes, while your methods are... unconventional, your results are undeniable. The Academy would be interested in funding further research...""

""Great!"" Madison beamed. ""I already have some ideas about studying deep-sea volcanic vents. Did you know humans can actually dive without mechanical assistance for several minutes? And I heard this planet has some amazing underwater cave systems...""

The collective groan from the audience was interrupted by Madison's tablet chiming. ""Oh cool, my permit for the marine study just got approved! Anyone want to join? I promise to pack extra waterproof sample containers this time.""

""Field Log, Final Entry,"" Zyx'tal recorded as the audience began frantically filing out of the auditorium. ""Human research methodologies have been officially classified as 'effective but terrifying.' New category created in Academy guidelines: 'Protocols for Human Scientists - What Not to Try to Replicate.'""

Madison was already sketching out plans for her next expedition. ""Hey Chief, think we can get some of those floating crystal beings to join the underwater research team? I have some theories about their reaction to hydrothermal vents...""

""Dr. Hughes,"" Zyx'tal sighed, his crystalline structure resigned to another adventure, ""perhaps we should wait until your ribs fully heal?""

""They're mostly healed! Besides, water is great for recovery. It'll be just like that time I studied shark behavior patterns while recovering from a mountain climbing accident. Now that was an interesting week...""

The Academy would later add a new warning to all research permits: ""Caution - Human Methodologies May Apply."" It became both the most feared and most requested classification in galactic scientific history.

1gt4pcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gt4pcn/a_stranger_bought_me_a_coffee_while_waiting_for/,A stranger bought me a coffee while waiting for the bus. Now what?,"I was sitting at the bus station at night, waiting for my bus, when a guy sat next to me. I arrived to the station quite early and I was working on my iPad on some homework while listening to music. I saw him lean towards me and he asked me if I was taking the same bus as him. I said yes, to which he asked me why I was taking this bus. We talked a little bit about that, he introduced himself and shook my hand.

  
I thought he was just being polite, but he kept asking me questions : what I did in school, what homework I was currently working on, what kind of music I was listening to, etc. Then, he went to go take a walk at a library nearby and it seemed like he was asking me to go with him, only I had too much luggage to do so. He came back eventually, we continued talking for a bit. He kept getting up to walk from time to time. As I was focused on my homework, I saw something in the corner of my eye. It was him, next to me, handing me a coffee. I was a bit nervous, I said thanks but didn't really know how to react. We continued talking until the bus got there. His seat was right behind mine and, when he sat, he leaned in and said ""hi""  close to my face (I realize this sounds very creepy, but it really wasn't). Before leaving, the driver asked him to switch seats with someone who wanted his place and he had to seat far away from me for the rest of the drive.

  
For the rest of the ride, I couldn't sleep because 1) I drank coffee and 2) I couldn't figure out the meaning behind that stupid coffee. And every time we took a break (it was an 8 hour ride so it happened a couple of times), I kept missing him because I would get off the bus too soon or too late. When we arrived in the morning, we were side by side waiting for our luggage. I wanted to thank him again, but he only said ""bye"" with a smile and walked away. Once again, I was confused. 



During the week I was there, the only time I went out was to go to my old school's library (I am not a hermit, I just had a lot of homework to do). I went to the library at 8AM, right when it opened, because there usually isn't a lot of people at this time which is nice and calm. And... he was there, of course. We sat far away from each other and he was sitting with his back to me, so he didn't see me when I sat. Nevertheless, he smiled at me everytime he got up and saw me. When he was ready to leave, he took a detour to come talk to me. He asked when I was leaving, I told him. And that's it.

  
Now what? Does he like me or something? Because I can't figure it out. I didn't think that coffee meant anything until I told people about it and they told me he must have a crush on me. I thought he was just being really nice, but now I can't stop thinking about it.

I went on my first hunting trip over the last couple days and wanted to show my pack and talk changes I'd make and also see if r/camping has their own perspectives. I'll list all of the gear first and then do a write-up for those interested.

Rifle

Underwear and Warming layers

Hiking Pants

Wool shirts

Wool socks

Warming layer

Poncho

Boots

USGI Medium Molle 2 Rucksack

Toaks titanium mug

USGI MSS Bivy

Hyke & Byke 0 F sleeping bag

Hygiene kit

Olight Warrior 3

Fire kit

550 cord bundle

Packtowl

Leatherman Wave+

Sawyer Squeeze

MSR Dromedary 6L hydration bag

Food bag

Anyways here's the comprehensive list:

There are a couple things not pictured so I'll get those out of the way first:

Remington 783 with a 16.5 inch barrel chambered in .308 was the rifle I took for deer, it's got a medium powered optic on it and weighs about 10 pounds. Right off the bat, not making it into the ultralight category. This was about the best rifle I could afford at the time so it's a bit heavy for its caliber but it's crazy accurate and a lot of fun to shoot. Got a suppressor with it too which was a bit of a process obviously, but worth it if you're into that stuff.

Boots and clothes worn. Smartwool t-shirt was my first layer followed by a sturdier merino tech shirt. This helped not smell like death after everything. I've also got some standard hiking pants are convertible to shorts. Definitely more summer attire and the material is thin, but they're comfortable and dry quickly which was a huge benefit out in the woods. Boots are Bates Black Combat Boots with a zipper. I love these things and do a ton of rucking in them when training for backpacking trips. Also have some typical underarmour leggings and top. Poly pro ""waffle top"", intermediate warming layer from Black Diamond, and a Izod waterproof shell I got from value village (also secured that sweet coffee table holding all the goods for less than $50)

Pictured:

The pack is an Army issued Medium Molle Ruck with Alice Pack Strap replacements. I'm a veteran and have a ton of nostalgia for this gear and I'm very familiar with it and trust it... but the weight adds up. I think with the rifle, having a pack like this made everything else feel just a little heavy, especially with how much off-trail movement we did. You'll notice a trend with all of the military issued stuff is that most of the time it's just too heavy. Attached to the pack are a couple sustainment pouches (this helped with organization because the pack is quite full when loaded) Also one holds the bathroom kit which I wanted to keep more on the exterior. On my waist belt is a USGI canteen cup holder which houses my Toaks titanium cup. 

In the pack is my sleep system which consists of a MSS Bivy, a Thermarest Xtherm Sleep Mat, and Hyke & Byke 0 F sleeping bag. The bivy is great and is a last layer of protection against condensation on my down sleeping bag. I was definitely getting every last degree out of that temperature rating. We got down to 26 on the coldest night and you could feel it if the sleep system wasn't organized right. The thermarest xtherm is a great sleep pad, nothing but good stuff to say.

Cook kit: Pathfinder pot, BRS stove (works great and is crazy light), fuel and a ""foon"". We made a really nice fire while we were out and cooked up a good stew with the steak, onion, and potatoes my friend brought. Hung it off of a stick used for a pothanger.

Orange Sea-to-summit dry bag which held my battery bank to keep my phone charged. Other things found their way into it when the rain inevitably picked up. We had to use OnX to make sure we were in the correct land and not drifting into other private land or somewhere where hunting wasn't allowed.

Medkit with some booboo kit stuff, blister treatment, and also some more heavy duty stuff like a tourniquet in the unlikely event of a firearm mishap or run-in with bigfoot.

What I've found to be the gold standard of waterbottles, the Smartwater bottle... However, I swapped it out for an essentia which is maybe a couple mm wider and fits my titanium camp mug perfectly. I recommend this setup more when you add the nozzle to it.

Black (somewhat) dry bag holds my socks to keep dry as well as a camo poncho to serve as a small shelter from weather when worn or setup. The camo helped me chill in a field for a couple hours to where a bird even landed a foot away not noticing me.

Balaclava (mostly for sleeping since I have a face exposed sleep system and shelter)

Hygiene kit: toothbrush/paste, tums, various meds like melatonin, benadryl, and ibuprofen.

Flashlight Olight Warrior 3 I believe. Great light. I love it. It's so great. Just bring a headlamp. I wish I had just brought a headlamp instead. The benefit is that the light is near indestructible and is waterproof and incredibly bright. If you have headlamp recommendations please share them

Fire kit in the green alice clip: Waterproof match holder with matches, lighter, ferro rod. As always, the lighter worked fine. I think I'll probably leave a couple of these redundancies at home. Despite the wood being waterlogged to the bone, we found some birch bark and spent a ton of time gathering intermediate stages to burn. Took 20 minutes of hands-on fire-tending, but we got it without needing to split anything.

550 cord bundle. Used every inch fastening the poncho shelter.

PackTowl. I'd probably leave this behind, it was so wet we basically just relied on fire to dry everything.

Food bag

Anyways here's the comprehensive list:

There are a couple things not pictured so I'll get those out of the way first:

Remington 783 with a 16.5 inch barrel chambered in .308 was the rifle I took for deer, it's got a medium powered optic on it and weighs about 10 pounds. Right off the bat, not making it into the ultralight category. This was about the best rifle I could afford at the time so it's a bit heavy for its caliber but it's crazy accurate and a lot of fun to shoot. Got a suppressor with it too which was a bit of a process obviously, but worth it if you're into that stuff.

Boots and clothes worn. Smartwool t-shirt was my first layer followed by a sturdier merino tech shirt. This helped not smell like death after everything. I've also got some standard hiking pants are convertible to shorts. Definitely more summer attire and the material is thin, but they're comfortable and dry quickly which was a huge benefit out in the woods. Boots are Bates Black Combat Boots with a zipper. I love these things and do a ton of rucking in them when training for backpacking trips. Also have some typical underarmour leggings and top. Poly pro ""waffle top"", intermediate warming layer from Black Diamond, and a Izod waterproof shell I got from value village (also secured that sweet coffee table holding all the goods for less than $50)

Pictured:

The pack is an Army issued Medium Molle Ruck with Alice Pack Strap replacements. I'm a veteran and have a ton of nostalgia for this gear and I'm very familiar with it and trust it... but the weight adds up. I think with the rifle, having a pack like this made everything else feel just a little heavy, especially with how much off-trail movement we did. You'll notice a trend with all of the military issued stuff is that most of the time it's just too heavy. Attached to the pack are a couple sustainment pouches (this helped with organization because the pack is quite full when loaded) Also one holds the bathroom kit which I wanted to keep more on the exterior. On my waist belt is a USGI canteen cup holder which houses my Toaks titanium cup. 

In the pack is my sleep system which consists of a MSS Bivy, a Thermarest Xtherm Sleep Mat, and Hyke & Byke 0 F sleeping bag. The bivy is great and is a last layer of protection against condensation on my down sleeping bag. I was definitely getting every last degree out of that temperature rating. We got down to 26 on the coldest night and you could feel it if the sleep system wasn't organized right. The thermarest xtherm is a great sleep pad, nothing but good stuff to say.

Cook kit: Pathfinder pot, BRS stove (works great and is crazy light), fuel and a ""foon"". We made a really nice fire while we were out and cooked up a good stew with the steak, onion, and potatoes my friend brought. Hung it off of a stick used for a pothanger.

Orange Sea-to-summit dry bag which held my battery bank to keep my phone charged. Other things found their way into it when the rain inevitably picked up. We had to use OnX to make sure we were in the correct land and not drifting into other private land or somewhere where hunting wasn't allowed.

Medkit with some booboo kit stuff, blister treatment, and also some more heavy duty stuff like a tourniquet in the unlikely event of a firearm mishap or run-in with bigfoot.

What I've found to be the gold standard of waterbottles, the Smartwater bottle... However, I swapped it out for an essentia which is maybe a couple mm wider and fits my titanium camp mug perfectly. I recommend this setup more when you add the nozzle to it.

Black (somewhat) dry bag holds my socks to keep dry as well as a camo poncho to serve as a small shelter from weather when worn or setup. The camo helped me chill in a field for a couple hours to where a bird even landed a foot away not noticing me.

Balaclava (mostly for sleeping since I have a face exposed sleep system and shelter)

Hygiene kit: toothbrush/paste, tums, various meds like melatonin, benadryl, and ibuprofen.

Flashlight Olight Warrior 3 I believe. Great light. I love it. It's so great. Just bring a headlamp. I wish I had just brought a headlamp instead. The benefit is that the light is near indestructible and is waterproof and incredibly bright. If you have headlamp recommendations please share them

Fire kit in the green alice clip: Waterproof match holder with matches, lighter, ferro rod. As always, the lighter worked fine. I think I'll probably leave a couple of these redundancies at home. Despite the wood being waterlogged to the bone, we found some birch bark and spent a ton of time gathering intermediate stages to burn. Took 20 minutes of hands-on fire-tending, but we got it without needing to split anything.

550 cord bundle. Used every inch fastening the poncho shelter.

PackTowl. I'd probably leave this behind, it was so wet we basically just relied on fire to dry everything.

Leatherman Wave. Important tools are the knife and the saw, but the needle-nose pliers rescued a splinter.

Sawyer Squeeze! Great filter setup but we ended up surviving off melted snow.

MSR Dromedary bag, this is useful in a lot of applications and helped me bring some water out and also wash my buddy and I's hands after cutting up some steak for dinner. Surprisingly light, I recommend it.

I lived in this shared accommodation for the past 6 months. Initially, I was all by myself and then, a family member moved in (I call her mum). 

It was a bumpy ride. Today, I cried multiple times as I’ll be leaving tomorrow. I did my laundry for one last time and searched for the neighbourhood cat in the backyard. I remember, back when it was summer, the cat would visit me almost every day. I miss those days. 

The tree right in front of my window has lost all its leaves now. When I first moved here, it was all green and fabulous. It makes me feel hurt because this tree has now lost all its leaves but it has been seeing me grow into a whole new person. One of my friends told me that it’s going to survive another winter and so are you. I believe in that. Maybe that friend is far away from me today, but I miss him. 

I can recall countless nights of sadness, despair, anxiety, stress, study sessions, uncertainty, doing nothing and listening to music, conversations with one of my closest people here, and me ending up snuggling with my pillow under this blanket in this small bed. I do feel like I’ll never get to experience this level of freedom again as my family has given me the clue that they will come back whenever I come back. So, I will miss it. 

I acknowledge the fact that growing up, I could never imagine of doing things for myself. So, when I had to take my own decision here, I felt like I was alive but also I was very distracted and distressed sometimes because I have never gone through that. Maybe I will miss this place so much because it has given me the opportunity to finally act like an adult even though my abusive parents are still in the picture. 

Ugh.. I’m feeling sleepy now… but I have got so much feelings to share. 

I will miss the nearby park and my lonely/anxious/happy/sad walks with all the neighbourhood people and their pets. I will miss the bus rides and the presence of the stranger who would travel to the same area as I would every single day. I remember I even was looking for him on my last day. He never seemed to care and maybe he’ll never know that in my head, I think he’s my travel buddy and he’ll never see me again. 

I will miss those hot chocolates and mocha after lunch, going to the library just to avoid that family member, and having a very interesting lunch break and drinking iced coffee, ordering food on my own, booking my Uber home etc. 

I will miss the first time I made an appointment with my GP. I still remember the music that I was listening to while being in the queue. I will remember my nonstop tears right in front of my GP. I am still very embarrassed about this. 

I will miss those warm smiles of people. That lady L who gave me some valuable advice that I was supposed to receive from my mum. That guy K who gave me some attention and warm smiles after he heard that I was leaving. I will remember those mean girls and confusing guys as well. I will remember random kind acts of strangers and cruel people who made me feel like shit. 

I will remember everything, the way that person and I stopped talking and how heartbroken I have become. I will remember my berry first experience with dating app, and meeting some strangers here who wanted to be my friend:) 

I will miss my room so much. I didn’t want to leave it dirty/untidy, so I cleaned the room and made it squeaky clean. This is the only thing I can do.

1gt4jgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperskill/comments/1gt4jgl/quick_review_of_the_introductory_to_java_track/,Quick review of the Introductory to Java Track (From a perspective of a beginner),"Hi all, I just completed the Introductory Java track, and I am very impressed. So, I am writing a short review, which also serves as a log of my progress.

Before I start, I want to explain a little bit about myself. I do not have any formal background in programming, and I have been trying to learn programming for many years. I consider myself a beginner even though I have taken some online courses (CS50, etc.), bought numerous introductory programming books on Python, and started many Udemy courses. I also dabbled in game engines (Godot, Unreal), and like so many other earlier endeavors, I was not able to complete anything in any seriousness. 

I also tried to study programming books, following the guides from Teach Yourself CS, or many other introductory textbooks online. Maybe it's the lack of perseverance or direction, but I find it difficult to stick to the program; I suspect it's because I tend to bite off more than I can chew as a self-taught learner. 

However, I found most success in learning coding through doing some VBA at work and writing out jank code only I can use. Recently, a developer role opened up at my company, and after talking with the hiring manager, I learned that in my industry (finance), the in-demand tech stacks are Java, Spring, and DevOps. I started doing some research, and through a random Reddit post on the best way to learn Java, I came across Hyperskill.

There are 77 modules/ short courses in Introductory Java, and they take around 15 minutes to complete. I was reluctant to do any project and eventually gave in after around 50 modules. The difficulty of each module varies, and I find myself researching other sources for a few topics such as Enum, Classes, Static/Public, etc. 

There are 5-10 questions at the end of each module, comprising multiple-choice(s), filling in the blanks, and straight-up coding. Although I dreaded the coding part, I also gained the most from it. The comment section and the AI chatbot are particularly helpful. I found myself using the chatbot on a few of the multiple choice questions with the prompt: ""Please explain the answers,"" and the AI was able to walk me through the process and explain all the items. The comment sections are useful for diving into details not covered by the course (there are also ample amounts of cheeky remarks), and they come in handy in the coding exercises. The difficulty of the coding exercise varies, and the integration between IntelliJ and the browser helps learning tremendously. (there are a few inconveniences/bugs. For example, when you already have a project open, and opening another browser question can mess up the project folder or throw a git commit popup.) Not every code can be run in the IDE, and that's rarely an issue (the comment section will usually provide instructions on the additional code to include to run the question). 

Obviously, the biggest value of Hyperskill is in its projects. I find myself returning to programming because of how much fun/frustration I am having to do the questions. One particular benefit of these projects is that they are divided into different segments (varying from 4 to 7). They provide a great break point for resting and thinking about how to organize the code. I often play a little minigame with myself to anticipate the upcoming requirements; in that way, I think more carefully about my overall design pattern. 

There is an option to share your project at the end of each stage (you can also share your coding exercises, but they must be of good quality, and I have not reached that point). I gain a little sense of accomplishment whenever I publish my code, and it's another factor that drives my daily programming habit. Another important learning tool is looking at other people's submissions. They are all better than mine, and I learned so much from critically reviewing my code with better examples. (Maybe it's a skill issue, but I find it harder to understand others' code in larger projects, so I focus more on smaller methods and class implementation).

Here is the outline of all the projects in the order in which I completed them and also in difficulties:

1. A text-based program going through elements of input and string output

2. A rule-based chatbot that responds to a list of fixed inputs

3. A game that prints out animals in the Zoo 

4. A command line Tic-Tac-Toe that tested by skill in string formatting 

5. A cinema seat-selling program that prints out 2D array outputs

6. An encoding/decoding program teaching about parsing and encoding binary 

7. A two-player game about drawing down pencils. It teaches modular arithmetic and a basic bot rule-based strategy. 

8. A coffee-making game where some math is used and practice structuring code in classes.

9. A game about guessing matching letters/digits. There are a lot of input and matching conditions and if/switch statements to manage.

10. A two-player battleship game that brings everything together. I am still amazed that my code worked. Feels like a fluked with me monkeying around testing different parameters. There is definitely room for improvement on this project. 

You need 95% completion on both learning modules and coding projects. I find it a bit odd that there are no projects to skip for the introductory Java track. I can see the final battleship programs to be a stumbling block for some people. (There were only 204 completions at the time of the writing, whereas the second last project (named Bulls and Cows) had 3000 completions. 

Introductory Java took me 15 days to complete. On average, I spend 3-4 hours daily during weekdays and more than 6 hours on weekends (the reference range is 43 hours from Hyperskill). 

In summary, I am more than happy with Hyperskill so far. I will continue my learning on the Java Developer track and report back when it's completed. (I also just bought Clean Code, Head First Java, and grokking algorithms to supplement my learning).

We live in camp while we work and we are nowhere near civilization. The only way to get here is by airplane or winter road. 

We are expanding so we have more manpower than usual so we have temporary housing in tents. These aren't camping tents and an air mattress or anything. They are proper arctic survival tents. With electricity and heating and every. The only difference is that they do not have private bathrooms like to regular camp rooms. So you have to walk about 100 yards to get to a bathroom. 

This has lead to some guys using piss jugs. It's exactly what it sounds like. You buy bottled drink and then you have a container so you don't have to leave your room to relieve yourself. Gross but understandable. 

The one iron bound rule is don't get caught. If the maids find it you are screwed. Terminated. Put on the no hire list for 90 days. 

My buddy Dan double screwed up. He forgot to get a bottle so he used a coffee cup he had in his room. Then he forgot to dispose of the cup in the morning. 

He got called to the office to be let go. He said it wasn't urine but his tea that he had let get cold. He proved it by drinking it. 

They didn't fire him because what kind of maniac would drink day old cold urine. 

He was telling us all how he pulled one over on the company and I laughed. I thought it was funny. He said it wasn't funny and that it's bullshit that he had to do that.

Attached to the pack are a couple sustainment pouches (this helped with organization because the pack is quite full when loaded) Also one holds the bathroom kit which I wanted to keep more on the exterior. On my waist belt is a USGI canteen cup holder which houses my Toaks titanium cup. 

In the pack is my sleep system which consists of a MSS Bivy, a Thermarest Xtherm Sleep Mat, and Hyke & Byke 0 F sleeping bag. The bivy is great and is a last layer of protection against condensation on my down sleeping bag. I was definitely getting every last degree out of that temperature rating. We got down to 26 on the coldest night and you could feel it if the sleep system wasn't organized right. The thermarest xtherm is a great sleep pad, nothing but good stuff to say.

Cook kit: Pathfinder pot, BRS stove (works great and is crazy light), fuel and a ""foon"".

Orange Sea-to-summit dry bag which held my battery bank to keep my phone charged. Other things found their way into it when the rain inevitably picked up. We had to use OnX to make sure we were in the correct land and not drifting into other private land or somewhere where hunting wasn't allowed.

Medkit with some booboo kit stuff, blister treatment, and also some more heavy duty stuff like a tourniquet in the unlikely event of a firearm mishap or run-in with bigfoot.

What I've found to be the gold standard of waterbottles, the Smartwater bottle... However, I swapped it out for an essentia which is maybe a couple mm wider and fits my titanium camp mug perfectly. I recommend this setup more when you add the nozzle to it.

Black (somewhat) dry bag holds my socks to keep dry as well as a camo poncho to serve as a small shelter from weather when worn or setup. The camo helped me chill in a field for a couple hours to where a bird even landed a foot away not noticing me.

Balaclava (mostly for sleeping since I have a face exposed sleep system and shelter)

Hygiene kit: toothbrush/paste, tums, various meds like melatonin, benadryl, and ibuprofen.

Flashlight Olight Warrior 3 I believe. Great light. I love it. It's so great. Just bring a headlamp. I wish I had just brought a headlamp instead. The benefit is that the light is near indestructible and is waterproof and incredibly bright. If you have headlamp recommendations please share them

Fire kit in the green alice clip: Waterproof match holder with matches, lighter, ferro rod. As always, the lighter worked fine. I think I'll probably leave a couple of these redundancies at home. Despite the wood being waterlogged to the bone, we found some birch bark and spent a ton of time gathering intermediate stages to burn. Took 20 minutes of hands-on fire-tending, but we got it without needing to split anything.

550 cord bundle. Used every inch fastening the poncho shelter.

PackTowl. I'd probably leave this behind, it was so wet we basically just relied on fire to dry everything.

Leatherman Wave. Important tools are the knife and the saw, but the needle-nose pliers rescued a splinter.

Sawyer Squeeze! Great filter setup but we ended up surviving off melted snow.

MSR Dromedary bag, this is useful in a lot of applications and helped me bring some water out and also wash my buddy and I's hands after cutting up some steak for dinner. Surprisingly light, I recommend it.

In the food hang bag is instant rice, instant oatmeal, jerky, trail mix, Bloom supergreens + metamucil powders, and some electrolyte packs. Pretty basic.

So that's it! Let me know any thoughts, recommendations on things to add/remove. It was a great trip, unfortunately didn't get a deer but ended up being a great trip with my friend and got some really good hiking and camping in!",4,1731813554.0,backpacking,6,0.7,False

I can't breathe and have to cough as much out of my lungs as possible, then the rest of the day my entire body hurts. I literally just feel AWFUL. 

I have been avoiding anything that might cause reflux, am prescribed pantoprozale (sp) and will take tums before bed. I have even had it happen when I sleep completely upright, like sitting straight up. It isn't every night and I am struggling to figure out whats causing it (unless I drink coffee, then I KNOW it was the coffee. I try to avoid it or at least drink as far away from sleep time as possible, but I don't drink it often because of this and it makes me so sad...but it's not worth the side effects) I can eat everything ""right"", have a very light meal, don't go to sleep for 6 hours after eating, take a few tums before bed, and probably have done more that I can't remember. My doctor doesn't seem to take it seriously. It is so frustrating.

Any tips? Also, what causes the extreme body aches after I get acid in my lungs? It just doesn't make sense to me, but I'm not a medical professional either. The aches are similar to heroin withdrawal but without the skin crawling feeling, if you know, you know. I've been clean many years on methadone. Beyond that, I just take the pantoprazole, metformin, and wegovy. (The weight loss has not had any effect on frequency, in case you're going to reccomend losing weight to stop the reflux. I understand the reasoning you might say it but I'm 80lbs down and almost at a healthy BMI so I don't think it's going to help me at all if it hasn't done anything yet....at least not for GERD.)

I usually start with a squeaky toy, then go to a rope (we play tug of war), but neither of those keep her attention that long and she goes back to digging. Afterward, I’ll do some training with her using regular treats. The moment we stop, back to digging. For higher value chews/treats, I’ve tried Himalayan yak cheese, bully sticks, marrow bones, and coffee wood sticks (mostly chews my vet advised against because they aren’t good for their puppy teeth 😳 but I’ve been desperate). 

Unfortunately, Kongs with kibble and frozen PB don’t interest her and neither does the Lickimat. The only thing that keeps her attention is the Woof Pupsicle but I assume she can’t have more than one of those a day. 

I’ve also tried cow ears and collagen sticks. Up until she was 14 weeks, she loved Nature’s Own Beef chips but now she could care less about them. I’ve tried rotating her toys but she quickly gets bored then goes back to digging. She is getting a lot of exercise, although likely not enough seeing as she’s a lab pup. Lately, she has been napping twice a day for about 2-2 1/2 hours each. 

I feel like I’m running out of options for getting her to stop the digging! Anyone have more suggestions? I’m not sure blocking access to the couch is possible either. ",1,1731813312.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

This is chapter 3 of my LucanisxFemRook fanfiction that I’ve been inspired to write. This story takes place when Rook is trapped within Solas’ Prison. As mentioned previously characters that appear in the lighthouse are based on my own game choices when I playedthrough Veilguard. 

This particular chapter so far has been the most challenging for me to write. I haven’t finished the whole fic yet but wanted to share the chapters I had completed. I will post chapter 4 as soon as I complete it. 

Hope you enjoy the read!

————————————————————————

Lucanis listened carefully as Bellara explained what had happened in those moments after he slayed Ghilinain. While she spoke his own memories of the events flashed in his mind. He remembered Rook pulling him out of the blight before being dragged away by one of Ghilanain’s tendrils. Harding’s sacrifice, giving him the opening he needed to stab the elven goddess. The feel of the lyrium dagger as it plunged deep into Ghilanain’s chest. Him supporting Rook back on her feet after being released from the goddess’ grasp. Emmrich shouting to retrieve the dagger. And then getting knocked down on his back by a sudden shock wave. After that his memories became hazy. That must have been when he’d been knocked unconscious. The last thing he faintly remembered was Rook calling his name. 

“After Rook picked up the dagger there was this flash of green light.” Bellara continued to explain. 

“It was so blinding that we all lost sight of her. The next thing we knew…she was gone. In her place was Fen’harel- I mean…Solas. He was standing where she stood and was holding the dagger. He had this look on his face…like he was sorry. But then he told us to leave before disappearing again. The rest I already told you earlier…” Her voice trailed off at the and she stood there awkwardly, fidgeting a bit as she waited to see how he’d respond. 

A few moments passed, but for Lucanis it felt like an eternity. His mind raced with questions. All of them asking how? 

How was this possible? 

How could Rook be gone? 

How could he have let this happen when he had been right at her side? 

How could he accept this?

Lucanis felt something restless stir within him. He didn’t know if it was Spite stirring from his slumber or his own frustration fueling it. Perhaps a mix of both. Whatever the case, he couldn’t accept what he had heard. He suddenly stood up from the bed, his feet touching the cold stone beneath him. 

“Lucanis…?” Bellara had an uneasy expression as she followed his gaze toward the door then looked back at him. “You really shouldn’t be out of bed yet. Emmrich should at least check you out first.”

But the urge to leave the infirmary overwhelmed him. He needed to get out. He had to see it for himself. Before he knew it, he was bolting out of the room.

“Lucanis, where are you going?!” He heard Bellara call out to him as he rushed past her. His legs had carried him all the way to Rook’s door. Knots tied in his stomach while staring at it. When he reached for the he handles he could feel his hands quivering with hesitation. His hands gripped each handle tightly and he could feel the rest of his body tensing up with anticipation. Behind the door he would see the truth for himself. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, steadying himself for what would come next, then pushed the door open.

The first thing Lucanis noticed when he entered the room was how cold it felt. Was it always this like this? Unlike the kitchen, Rook’s room didn’t have a fireplace, but that didn’t stop the room from having a certain warmth about it. She would usually have all the candles in the room lit up, giving the room a welcoming orange glow to compete with the cool blue light of her windows. 
Though, the more he thought about it, perhaps it was her all along that filled the room with so much warmth and comfort. Especially in those moments when he’d steal away into her room for coffee and other fleeting pleasures they managed to share in each other’s company.

Lucanis drifted his way over to the couch, catching sight of the thin layer of dust forming on the surfaces of her table and shelves. He sat down bathed in the blue light and let it all sink in…

Her voice as she spoke with him. The feel of her hands stroking his hair when he allowed himself to relax in her embrace. Her smile that made his heart race. All of his comforts were slipping away. 

Lucanis buried his face in his hands cursing under his breath. Wasn’t he the one that was worried about hurting her? And yet, all he could feel was the tightening of his chest.   How was he supposed to live like this after she had torn down all his walls?

As a crow, Lucanis was no stranger to loss. He had lost his family and those he considered friends within the ranks. It was all part of being a crow. When he thought he’d lost Caterina, of course he felt pain, but she’d primed him for such a possibility from a young age. Caterina was the one who taught him to steel his heart and remain focused on the task at hand, even in the face of loss. It would be impossible to be a crow otherwise.

Rook on the other hand was always doing impossible things. She fought against foes much stronger than herself with ferocious determination. Each encounter gambling with her life and somehow coming out on top. She then somehow found the time to check in with each and every one of them without asking anything in return. At some point he must have started believing she was untouchable.

But now here he was, alone, while she was Maker knows where. He cursed to himself again and again. He let this happen. He let her in, and now he was reaping what he sowed. The pain was almost too much for him to bear in the moment. 

“Pathetic.” The hiss came from within. Spite was awake. 

The demon was standing over him with arms crossed glaring at him. “Are you really just going to sit there and feel sorry for yourself?” The demon leaned in closer. 

Lucanis straightened up, glaring right back at the demon. “No, but I need to think.”

“What’s there to think about?!” The demon roared in exasperation. “We know what we need to do. We need to find her.” 

“Find her?” Lucanis stood up. “Spite, we don’t even know where to look. Let alone know if she’s even…”

“Don’t. Say. It.” Spite hissed through gritted teeth. 

“Alive.” Lucanis surprised himself when he said it. Not only that, but the tone of his voice was much harsher sounding than usual. It must’ve been because Spite was egging him on. Spite howled with rage and jumped at him, the force knocking Lucanis back down on the couch. In the next moment he was gasping for breath and felt something dripping from his nose. Blood. It was blood. 

Lucanis held the bridge of his nose to stop the bleeding. It had been awhile since Spite had last struck him like that. Not since their first night in the lighthouse…

He sighed to himself. In the back of his head he could feel a migraine coming on. More petty punishment from Spite. This was going to be a problem. 

Then behind him he could hear footsteps. He calculated about four people. Bellara must have called everyone to check on him. Perhaps they were worried they would have another incident with Spite on their hands. 

“Lucanis…are you alright?” He heard the elf woman meekly ask. He turned his head and she gasped seeing the blood. 

He waved his free hand signaling that he was fine. Taash and Davrin were standing behind her looking weary. Emmrich was the first to step foot into the room. 

“Mr. Dellamorte,” he addressed him politely at first then seemed to change his mind “Lucanis…we’re so sorry that you had to learn about what happened to Rook this way. We all know how close you two were.” 

The others walked inside, still seeming cautious with their approach. He could sense they were bracing themselves for the worst just in case. He sighed and stood up, wiping away the blood with the back of his hand. 

Emmrich continued “With that in mind I think you should take some extra time to rest.”

“No,” Lucanis replied. “I’ve rested long enough. I need a target.”

1gt3y20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1gt3y20/down_124_pounds_and_not_looking_back/,Down 124 Pounds and Not Looking Back,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my weight loss journey with you all because I know how hard it can feel when you're at the starting line. I wanted to start and stop quite a few times especially at the start of my weight loss journey. I guess I needed time to realize that I was worth the effort and Iearned that I needed to love myself and offer myself a bit of grace along the way.  My first take away was that its ok to forgive yourself and embrace who you are and acknowledge the pain, suffering, and struggle that you have endured and to remember that the person looking back in the mirror is/was incredibly strong to survive.  We all have prior challenges and that is why this community is so important for people. I've been a longtime watcher of this subreddit without sharing my experience. In 2025, I want to be a part of building a community of people who support each other and that provide positivity. This is my start at community building by sharing my Journey.

So far,I've lost **124 pounds**, going from **360 lbs to 236 lbs**, thanks to a combination of Zepbound, learning portion control, and major lifestyle changes. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s been completely worth it—and life-changing.

# My Starting Point

* **Starting Weight:** 360 lbs
* **Current Weight:** 236 lbs
* **Body Fat:** Down from 39.4% to 30.3%
* **BMI:** Down from 38 (obese) to 32 (still obese, but much closer to overweight).
* **Visceral Fat:** From 20 (excessive) to 14 (high, but improving).

I wasn’t just carrying extra weight—I was carrying the physical and emotional toll that came with it. I felt stuck, but I knew I had to take that first step.

# The First Few Months: Tough but Transformative

Let me be honest—the beginning of this journey was **brutal**.

* **Side Effects:** I had **severe nausea, body aches, and discomfort after eating large meals.** It was a wake-up call that I needed to **learn how to eat properly**. Portion control wasn’t just a concept—it became a necessity.
* **Adjusting to Change:** I had to completely overhaul my relationship with food. I realized that my old eating habits weren’t sustainable and that smaller, more mindful meals were the key to success.

It was tough, but I stuck with it. Now, aside from feeling **cold a lot of the time**, I have virtually no side effects. Zepbound has become an incredible tool in helping me control my appetite and make better choices.

# What Helped Me Succeed

* **Caloric Intake:** I eat between **1200-1500 calories a day**, focusing on non-processed, whole foods.
* **Hydration:** I cut out soda and alcohol entirely, sticking to water, black coffee, tea, and Fairlife 30g protein shakes (I know there will be criticism but they are and will continue to be an important part of my journey).
* **Meals:** I rely on HelloFresh meals for convenience and portion control, skipping processed snacks and desserts most of the time.  I supplement HelloFresh by going to Sam's and picking up produce, salad mix, and frozen veggies to add to my meals.  I also keep egg whites and sausage/bacon bits with grits for breakfast. I know grits aren't necessarily a healthy breakfast choice but I'm from the south and needed some comfort food :-).
* **Supplements:** I take 5 Metamucil fiber capsules and a Nature Made Men’s Daily No Iron supplement daily.  I talked with my doctor about supplements and which ones to take. Please talk with your doctor because different people may need different supplements.

I also started working out, using an **elliptical for 45 minutes, 3 times a week.** It’s not just about the calories burned—it’s about feeling stronger and more energized.

# The Moment It Hit Me

One of the strangest things about losing weight was how long it took for me to actually notice the difference.

I recently had to fly for work, and for the first time, I realized how few people were looking at me. I never noticed before just how much my weight seemed to attract attention. That moment hit me hard—this journey wasn’t just changing my body; it was changing how the world interacted with me, and more importantly, how I saw myself.

# How Zepbound Helped

Zepbound has been a **game-changer** for me. It’s not a quick fix or a magic pill—you still have to put in the work—but it gave me the tools I needed to change my relationship with food. It helped me stick to smaller portions, break old habits, and stay consistent.

# Takeaways

1. **The First Few Months Are Hard:** Between side effects and adjusting to new habits, it’s not easy. But it gets better, and the results are worth it.
2. **Learn to Eat Differently:** Portion control and mindfulness around food are critical. I had to completely rethink how I approached meals.
3. **Consistency Wins:** Weight loss isn’t about perfection—it’s about doing the right things most of the time.
4. **Unexpected Changes:** Beyond the physical transformation, losing weight changed how I saw myself and how others see me.

# What’s Next?

I’m not done yet. My goal is to reach a healthy BMI, build muscle, and continue to improve my health.

In a world filled with so much division, let’s take a moment to focus on what unites us: the ability to support, encourage, and uplift one another. Together, as a community, we can share our journeys, learn about the challenges of obesity, and educate both ourselves and others about this disease. Most importantly, let’s never forget the incredible strength it took to start this journey. We shouldn’t feel shame about where we began—those experiences shaped us and gave us the resilience we need to keep moving forward. Let’s celebrate our growth and the strength that brought us here.

I hope everyone has an amazing holiday filled with hope, joy, and fellowship!

1gt3wrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1gt3wrg/tifu_by_flinging_dog_mess_in_my_dream_girls_grill/,TIFU by flinging dog mess in my dream girl’s grill moo,"For the sake of this post I’m going to call her Catie. If you happen to read this please know it was a massive accident. 

The cutest girl I’ve ever seen in my life frequents a coffee shop down the street from my apartment. She always sits alone in a corner and works on her MacBook for a few hours between breakfast and lunch. 

All my cards on the table, I’m a pretty above average guy in the looks department. I apologize if this comes off as bragging but it’s relevant to the story.
I’ve never had issues talking to women because honestly they always smile when I make eye contact with them and half the time they start talking first.

That said, for literally half a year I could not even make eye contact with Catie. She was religiously engrossed in her laptop. She would also often bring her dog, a big hound, on days when the weather was nice and she opted to sit outside. 

I’d given up on trying to chat with Catie a month or two ago. She never noticed me and I accepted it wasn’t to be. This morning she’d brought her dog, however, and as I was walking in the hound immediately got up and ran to me. His leash had been looped around her chair but I guess she’d done a poor job of securing it. She jumped up, terrified, and said “grab him, grab him please!”

Apparently her dog is a runner and she was scared he’d bolt. I scooped the dog up (probably 85 pounds) and brought him over to her. Catie’s hands were shaking. She was really worried he’d run off. This was a big dog! I set him down and he licked my hand as she took his leash. 

Then she literally stepped towards me and kissed me on the cheek. Cloud 9! We’d never even spoken and now she’s kissed me. Best moment of 2024. The fact that the day would end so horrifically after such an auspicious beginning still blows my mind. What the hell!

Anyway, she introduces herself and thanks me profusely. Tells me how Mack (her pup) once ran into the woods across the street and she chased him for half a day and he almost died. Then she’s like “omg! I KISSED you. I am so sorry. What am I doing?” 

I told her with a complete straight face that it was in fact NOT ok and that my boyfriend was calling the police to report a sexual assault. Her eyes went wide and she scanned the shop looking for my boyfriend when I started laughing and she punched my arm (second best moment of my year somehow). I told her it was totally cool and asked if she wanted to go for a walk on the trail through the park at the end of the street. 

She agreed and we start walking.

I wasn’t going to describe her but I have to. She has bright red natural hair, the brightest shade of red you can imagine that wouldn’t be fake, and the greenest eyes I’ve ever seen in my life. She’s trim, 5’9 maybe, with the most gorgeous angel face I’ve seen in real life or in the movies. She’s a bona fide 11. 

Thirty minutes later we are connecting on every level. We both love rock scuba diving and tropical ports of call. We’ve read all the same books, work in tangential fields, laugh at all of each other’s jokes. It’s a sublime afternoon.

Then Mack (her dog) decides to use the restroom in the leaves beside the trail. He finishes taking a rather large and slimy bowel movement. Catie is hyper embarrassed because she doesn’t have any bags to pick it up. I tell her it’s in the leaves off trail and doubt anyone will notice anyway.

However, she INSISTS we do something. 

“Do you think I could just scoop it up below the leaves and toss it?” She asks.

“With your hands?” I say, aghast. “If it’s that big a deal I’ll do it.”

She looks grateful but also embarrassed so I bend down to scoop up this crap by cupping my hand under the leaves blanketing the forest floor.

At first it seems successful. I’ve scooped up the crap and toss it deep off the trail but then I hear Caitie say “oh no!”

As things turn out it was doggy diarrhea not just poop. My entire right hand is slimed. Instinctively I flick my hand once to get the biggest glob of poo off but it stubbornly clings on to my palm after the downward flick and instead opts to LEAVE my hand on the upswing. 

And in slow motion a massive, glob of dog shite careens into my dream girl’s face. Like covered. In her eyes, in her gorgeous hair, down to her chin. I couldn’t have repeated that if I tried for the next thousand years. She was standing 10 feet away from me as I shook off my hand. But it gobsmacks her in the face? Are you kidding?

Worse yet, she fucking screams, a blood curdling cry, and then yells “are you fucking for real?” As if I DID IT ON PURPOSE!!!!

She turns and sprints away with her dog in tow, screaming at the top of her lungs like she’s being chased by a rapist.

I just stood their in shock till the sound of her screaming vanished in the distance. 

TLDR 

I somehow managed to fling a giant handful of goopy dog poop into the face of the prettiest woman on planet earth.

In the last 5 weeks, a lot has happened. I opened a door in my life that had been sealed up for a long time. The warning label had faded, curled up, and dropped off. It used to say some stuff about being social, old emotional wreckage, and probably spiders.

To be fair, I was only going to open it a bit, have a peek, then probably close it again. But when I looked out, you were there. Like somebody holding out their hand and saying, ""Come on.""
And I did.

There is light where you are. I can see things are fine. We have coffee and bacon rolls. We talk about the stuff of life and laugh. It's comfortable. 

If I look back, I can still see that door. 
I don't think I could reach it. If I could get there, I don't think it opens from this side. That's OK, though. I like it here.

It doesn’t feel random that you were there. We’ve been neighbors for ages but never talked much. The door was closed. Maybe it was meant to open now. Maybe you were meant to be there, to show me that it’s okay to step outside, to connect.

For now, I’m grateful for every moment. Thank you for being there. And here.

I get that people have warm feelings inside, burning of the bosom, but feelings aren't facts. All people of all religions have good feelings and spiritual experiences. Feelings are not an indication of truth. 

If you find out Joseph Smith married a 14-year-old girl, do you get warm feelings in your heart telling you it's true? Why not, if it's true you should be able to feel warm and fuzzy about it, even if you don't like it something should tell you it's true. 

No, you were raised and socialized through your entire life to believe weird things about your church. Things such as--Mormonism is the only true church, you can only be with your family if you are righteous, the Book of Mormon is from real gold plates and from God. You already know, and are probably embarrassed by the temple garb and secret rituals. 

From the time you were a child and attended church each week you have had smart adults tell you these things are true, your family tells you these things are true, so, you grow up ""knowing"" the church is true no matter what the evidence shows. They tell you it's true, ""Because of your feelings.""

It's 2024, it's time to accept that Mormonism is an old-school 1800s religion that is out of touch with truth. Are archeologists joining Mormonism in droves? (The amazing stories of archeologists who did join the church have left it). Are the smartest people on earth who study religion joining the church? No, nor are those who are looking for one true religion. The people who join Mormonism are not wealthy, smart, families, but single, poor individuals down on their luck and looking for friends. They will join and come to church for a few months and then leave to find a better church. 

Be true to what you know inside, Mormonism isn't true and is easily disproven. The leaders talk about the same thing at every meeting. Just the small fact that they don't want you to drink coffee, not for a rule of health, but for obedience. That should tell you all you need to know about your leaders, they want you to be obedient only. Your best interest doesn't matter to them. Yes, there are good people in Mormonism, it's the Mormon Church that is rotten. 

It's time to accept reality and admit what 99% of the world already knows. ",7,1731811515.0,exmormon,1,0.89,False

As mentioned previously, characters mentioned in the lighthouse are based on the choices I made during my own playthrough of Veilguard. This fanfic contains references to u/PunkinPumpkin ‘s fanfic “In Spite of You”. 

I hope you enjoy the fic.
————————————————————————

A familiar scent hung in the air. Roasted  coffee beans with a hint of something Lucanis couldn’t quite put his finger on. His eyes slowly opened and through his blurred vision he caught sight of an elven figure standing nearby. They seemed to be humming to themselves and were hunched over slightly. He could hear the scribbling of a quill on parchment. Were they writing in a journal? His voice came out as barely a whisper.

“…rook…?”

The figure suddenly straightened up and faced him.

“Lucanis? You’re awake!” 

As his vision cleared, Lucanis could clearly see that it wasn’t Rook standing by, but Bellara. The young Dalish woman and him had gotten to know each other well enough. Though awkward at times, he found Bellara to be good company. She was a formidable mage in her own right, but much more adept with contraptions and elven history. She was also the only other person who took the cooking rotation as seriously as he did. They had bonded over making grocery lists and swapping cooking techniques. 

The young elf looked at him with disbelief and excitement dancing in her eyes as she placed her quill and journal to the side. 

“It is you right? I mean, your eyes aren’t glowing purple, so I know it’s not Spite at least.” 

“Yes, it’s me.” The crow groaned in response. He would have rubbed his face but he felt his arm tugged back by the wrist before it could even reach his chin. In confusion his eyes darted toward his wrist, where he saw a strange contraction holding his arms and legs down to the infirmary bed. He then turned his gaze back toward Bellara with a cocked brow.

“Oh!” Bellara blurted before he even get a word out. “I’m so sorry! Let me get those for you.” She immediately got to work removing the restraints with meticulous care. “It was the best we could do…” She trailed off as she worked.

He propped himself up on his elbows, to get a closer look. They didn’t look like any restraints he was familiar with. Elven perhaps, or something Bellara had modified? He would have to ask her about it later. 

“Bellara, what happened?”

“It was after you stabbed Ghilan’nain.” She continued working as she talked, removing the first restrain and moving onto the next without pausing. 

“You lost consciousness and we brought you back to the lighthouse as we retreated. But…you weren’t exactly the first to wake up.” She finished removing the second restraint on his wrist and moved toward his ankles. Lucanis rubbed his wrists as he sat up. He caught a glimpse of some minor bruising and scratches from attempts to pull against the restraints. 

“Spite kinda went berserk while you were away…it took both Davrin and Taash to hold him down while I put these on him. Then Emmrich used a spell to sort of put you both into a deeper sleep just so we could keep him from leaving and you safe.” 

Now that he thought about it, he hadn’t noticed Spite in his sight or even lingering in his thoughts. Was it possible for the demon to be unconscious? It was a strange feeling…

“How long was I out for?” He asked.

“Oh…about a week.” She finished unlocking the third restraint and moved on to the final one. “Emmrich told us that it’s not unusual for some individuals to be asleep for days with that spell, but that we should keep an eye on you. Especially if it wasn’t well…you who woke up first again.” 

A week?! He’d been unconscious for that long. Mierda…

“We each took turns watching you, waiting for you to wake up. Davrin carved that.” She gestured toward a small figurine that looked like him. “I think Taash was very vigilant the whole time. Emmrich made sure your body was still healthy and taken care of. And I of course made sure these restraints were working as intended. But I felt like I could be doing more. So when I asked Emmrich if there was anything I could do to help get you back on your feet, he told me that sometimes familiar smells can help rouse individuals. So I thought that maybe brewing coffee would help.” She smiled a little as she finally finished fiddling with the last restraint.

“I tried a bunch of different brews. Stuff that I remembered you telling me about while cooking on rotation. Different bean blends, roast types, I even tried boiling the beans! But nothing seemed to work…until today.” She looked over toward the steaming cup on the bedside table nearby. She quickly moved to pick it up and brought it to him, nearly pushing the warm cup into his hands. “If I remember correctly, this is how Rook makes it right?” 

Lucanis looked down at the cup, swirling the coffee and taking in its scent again. A simple brew with roasted beans and chicory root. He brought brew to his lips and felt its warmth fill him. A small smile formed on his lips until he realized something…

His gaze met hers as he slowly placed the cup back on the table. 

“Where is Rook?” 

Bellara bit her lip and her eyes looked down at her feet. 

“Oh…I thought you remembered…” she said looking troubled. He could tell this wasn’t something she wanted to tell him.

“Remembered what exactly?” He could feel a pit forming in his stomach as he asked.

i started talking to his sister, whose the same age as me(15, my friend is 16), and we didnt really talk to each other before because we didnt know each other all that great. she offered me some coffee and asked if i had ever seen vampire diaries, then asked if i wanted to watch some of it with her since id never seen it.

we started talking about the show, which trailed off into other topics of discussion, and we realized that we're really similar and get along really well. 

my friend was kinda giving us crap for being so similar, but we didnt mind cuz we find it funny that we kinda danced around each other and really only did the necessary things to be polite when we saw each other, only for us to get along really well and like talking to each other.

i even held eye contact with her, and i cant make/hold eye contact to save my life. i maintained eye contact for like... 2 minuets, before i noticed i was doing it, and i didnt do the weird shifty eye thing i do to avoid eye contact.

im so damn proud of myself for this. my friend didnt really get why me and his sister were so excited about the fact that we were able to do this when we both hate talking to people we dont know and making eye contact, because he has absolutely no problem doing it, but when his mom got home from work and we told her about it, she was so proud of us for being able to talk to each other as long as we did and get to know each other.

we knew a little bit about each other because of my friend, but until today we had only said things like ""hi, thank you, your welcome, i like your shirt"" to each other, and kinda froze up when one of us would say something to the other.

1gt3q8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1gt3q8e/theres_something_in_the_coffee/,There's something in the coffee... ,"(Looking for review)

I’ve been awake for eighteen days. 



That's not hyperbole or any form of exaggeration. I've genuinely gone all this time without any sleep or rest. 



Not even a wink.



And the craziest part is that I don't feel like I need it. I don't know how I'm still alive. These last few days have been some of the craziest in my life, and I feel like it's about to get much worse. 



It all began on the eve of one of my exams. The dreaded finals week had come around, and although I had studied for it throughout the month of April and prepared myself to the best of my ability, it was still stressing me out quite a bit. Something about having a considerable portion of grades dependent on one test… just never sat right with me. 



I had been lying in my bed for the past three hours, tossing and turning, frustrated, unable to allow myself to slip into that glorious world of slumber. It was 4 a.m… I had my next final at 8 a.m. that same day. 



Eventually, I had enough, so I decided to get out of bed and pull an all-nighter to do some extra studying. After all, staying up through the night had always been better than dozing off for two hours and then being rudely awoken, surprisingly enough. 



So, with that, I sighed, got up from my bed, and started putting on my clothes. I headed out the door into the warm, humid Floridian air. The campus library was open, as was to be expected; they were always open twenty-four hours during finals week. 



It was entirely still. The information desk was open, and some poor soul who had taken the student job was staffing it overnight. I looked over, and she didn't even move her head to notice me, staring blankly at the screen ahead of her. 



There were other people in here, too, just not a lot. Now and then, you'd see the occasional chair filled by the zombified student, with a cup of coffee in one hand, their laptop in the other, and a lovely pie of pizza resting on the table in front of them. 



*Typical.* 



In the center of the main lobby stood a beautifully made table with a white cloth draped over it. On top were two big metallic cylinders, coffee dispensers, with a basket containing a bunch of small paper cups to the right. Further to the side was a variety of creams, sugars, and sweeteners. 



The sight didn't surprise me. This school had a tradition of offering free coffee to all students during the late hours of finals week. It was a nice gesture for everyone who was stressing out about the upcoming exams, I suppose. 



I'm not a coffee drinker—never was— I despise the taste. Still… it *was* 4 a.m., and I was about to pull an all-nighter. So, with that in mind, I caved and filled up one of the paper shot cups, making sure to load it with so much cream that, frankly, you probably wouldn't be able to call it coffee anymore. 



With that, I made my way up the stairway to the right, which took me to the third floor, the computer lab. 



I made my way to one of the tens of empty computers and logged into my account, and pulled up my professor's PowerPoint presentation, relieved that I was about halfway through this cursed week and that it would all be over soon.



I practically gulped the coffee down in a minute. It tasted about how you would expect.



But the texture, the texture was off…



As the hot liquid slid its way down my throat… I felt… something like a rough surface pass by my tongue. It was almost as if little tiny balls were in the fluid, like cottage cheese, but a tad less noticeable. I didn't think much of it then, figuring it was probably something I put into the coffee or something with this particular brand. 



A quick look inside the cup revealed nothing unusual, so I quickly forgot about it. 



I was considering getting another one when, just ten minutes later, the caffeine took effect. It was insanely powerful, more than I expected. My heart was throbbing in my chest, as I was jolted into awakensss. I felt like I had just slept ten hours.



Suffice it to say, I'm glad I didn't take another one. I think I would've succumbed to cardiac arrest almost immediately. 



I continued studying in that library until about 7 a.m. when the sun began to peak over the horizon. As I exited, stepping into the crisp morning air, I still felt perfect. The heart pounding in my chest was the only thing telling me that this period of energy was artificial.



 I finally understood why people were such avid coffee drinkers now, and I thought that maybe I should do this more often. 



It ended up taking until about 2 p.m. that day for the caffeine to wear off. At last, I could feel my body begin to slow down, and the full effect of the all-nighter I had just pulled came over me like a rock. It was like somebody had snapped their fingers, and I just… crashed… 



I decided to return to my bed and attempt to sleep off last night. Not for too long, though; after all, I had more finals in the morning. And thinking of that got my fear going once again. I had said I had prepared the best I could, but the one that was coming up... Oh boy… No matter what I tried, I couldn't figure out half of it. And the thing was worth about 40% of my grade… if I didn't do well on this final, it would tank my class average.



A slight panic set in at the thought of it. I should mention that I have a mild case of anxiety. Not to the extreme where I get regular panic attacks, but just enough to make every testing situation about ten times worse than it is for anyone else. I tossed and turned for about thirty minutes in this pit of dread I was drowning in when suddenly. Something very peculiar happened.



My sleepiness disappeared again. It was just… gone… entirely and utterly vanquished. I didn't know what to make of it at first but blamed it on the adrenaline currently shooting through my veins and decided to splash some cold water on my face and take a hot shower to calm down.



It didn’t help… two hours of laying there passed… nothing… It didn't make sense to me. It was as if the crash had just… ended…



As I wasn't getting any sleep, I decided to use this time to work some more. Being so worried about what was coming up and all, and I did just that until about 11 p.m. that night… 



And again… I just… still didn't feel tired… I spent hours tossing and turning, hoping, begging myself to fall asleep, but no dice. 



I had enough at this point. 



I pulled out my phone and did a quick google search on how long caffeine is supposed to last. Most results pointed me in the direction of four to six hours, with the more extreme estimates being up to twelve. This had already gone far longer than any of the websites suggested. 



I rationalized it away by saying that perhaps I was just sensitive to caffeine and that since this was my first real exposure, it would take a while for the effects to subside. 



I was going to crash eventually. I just needed to wait it out. 



But that didn't happen. It was now 4 a.m., and I was still lying awake in bed, feeling no different. I decided to spend the night studying again, very decidedly *not* taking any of the coffee this time, slightly annoyed that I would likely regret it in the middle of the next morning's final. 



I didn’t. 



Nothing had changed. And now, I was starting to get concerned. 



Did I have some adverse reaction or something? What was going *on?* I called my mom to ask what she had to say. She was equally concerned for my well-being and suggested I take a trip to the university's health center.



The best they could do for me was recommend I take some medication and see if that fixed it and instructed me to call a doctor if it didn't.



Their suggestion didn’t help.



Not only that, but as I lay awake for hours, a chill sweat began to trickle down my skin. It started gradually, but it eventually became intense, such that my sheets quickly became drenched in the stuff. My head as well… was *throbbing; a piercing*, screaming headache shot its way through my brain, only getting worse. It was as if I had just been shot. 



There was a different kind of thumping in the head, though… one much more unexplainable. On top of the raging headache, I felt something else—a tiny, slight, unrhythmic tapping… seeming to occur at different parts of my brain. I paid close attention as it slowly moved from one side of my forehead to the other, then around the back of the skull before continuing to wrap itself around. 



I didn’t know what to make of it. And that’s also where I drew the line.



Enough was enough. 



I was calling a doctor tomorrow. 



Well, I did that the following morning, and the response I got was something like, ""Sorry, the best we can do is give you an appointment in two weeks.""



*Great.* 



All praise the healthcare system, I guess. 



But I did the only thing I could: I said, ""Okay,"" booked the meeting, and hoped it wouldn't worsen.



The following day was when things started to get a little scary. My mother nearly gasped when she saw me on facetime. Saying that I looked ""Paler than snow .""



I had to agree with her because, in the middle of our conversation, I got a sudden wave of extreme nausea, gagging harder than I ever had before. I hastily hung up the call and sprinted to the bathroom, just in time to empty my stomach contents into the toilet bowl. I sat there, retching for the next hour. All the while, the headache and those odd irregular feelings circling themselves around my brain continued.



And if that wasn’t bad enough, as I was donating my insides to the indoor plumbing, I swear I saw something move in the corner of my eye. It was brief… but it looked like an… odd elongated shape slowly moving up the bathroom wall. I didn't get a good look at it, as it appeared to hurry out of view entirely before I turned around.



I searched the entire place, top to bottom, but there was no sign of the damn thing. It was like it had just… vanished… 



That was the final straw. 



I assumed the sleep deprivation was getting to me, and I was beginning to hallucinate, even though I still felt as awake as ever. But I didn't care anymore. Enough was enough; I could not, in any way, wait *two* *weeks* for an appointment. 



And so without any options left, I picked up the phone and dialed 9-1-1. 



The paramedics arrived within minutes, and I quickly explained the situation to them, and, after seeing how terrible I looked, they immediately put me on a stretcher and whisked me away to the local hospital. 



The two-hour wait in the emergency room was what I could best describe as miserable. I was stuck sitting on cheap plastic chairs in a sanitary, lit open room surrounded by patients suffering from god knows what illness. The icing on the cake was that my symptoms continued to worsen throughout my entire stay. 



My vision was beginning to go hazy, and I swear I kept seeing something move in my peripheral vision, like that thing I found back in my apartment. 



Finally, after hours of torture, The doctor finally called me and escorted me to my new room. He introduced himself as Dr. Jones and ran me through some basic questions, you know, the typical stuff.



“How are you feeling, Kevin?”



“Terrible.”



“Have you taken any drugs recently?”



“Other than Nyquil? No…”



“Do you drink any alcohol? ” 



“Very rarely.” 



It was just your standard, run-of-the-mill doctor's questioning, but soon, one toward the end caught my attention. 



“Did you drink any caffeinated beverages recently?” The doctor asked.

I stopped for a moment. ""...I mean, I *did* have a shot of coffee… but it was… three… four days ago?""



The doctor made a hum of acknowledgment, his expression considerate before shaking it off. ""Okay… well, that shouldn't be causing this then… I'm going, to be honest with you, Kevin: I'm not sure what's happening… So what we're going to do now is run you through a few tests to hopefully determine an answer…and if we can't find anything… then we might have to keep you here overnight to perform a sleep test.""



I snorted.



*Sleep test… right…* 



The preliminary tests went exactly as expected. They took some blood, checked my blood pressure, and looked at my heart rate—all the standard stuff. Everything turned out negative for any sort of issue. My vitals were perfect… frustratingly so. 



He then informed me they would proceed with the sleep test that night. They escorted me to a place that looked more like a hotel room than a hospital. A big window at the far end would let in plenty of natural light during the day, another blurred-out window on the right side, and a neat little old-fashioned lamp stood on a nightstand. The bed itself looked rather cozy and had a lovely wooden finish as a headboard. If I weren't so ill, I would've admired it. 



After hooking me up to various pieces of equipment that I couldn’t even explain the purpose of Dr. Jones spoke again. ""Alright… you're all set up, Kevin. Now, don't worry. We're going to be watching from the adjacent room the entire night, okay? So if you need anything… just ask.""



I nodded my head, the only response I could make in my current state, and watched as he handed me a couple of pills. 



""Oh, and one more thing, here is some Silenor for the night… it's an insomnia medication; it should be more powerful than the stuff you had before… Hopefully, it might have an effect."" 



After I swallowed what he had given me, the doctor made his way out of the room and shut off the lights before closing the door. And just like that, I was left with nothing but complete, overbearing silence, broken only by the gentle hum of machinery. 



The whole place was pitch black, as my eyes hadn't adjusted yet. I gently eased my head back into the pillow and closed them, hoping to finally catch some Zs. The bed was really comfortable; in any other situation, I would've fallen asleep within minutes. 



But now… 



One hour passed…



Two hours passed…



I was beginning to get frustrated. I still did not feel tired in the slightest, and it seemed that the tablet the doctor had given me wasn't helping. So I just lay there, staring at the ceiling for some time and holding my eyes shut.



Nothing happened until about midnight, and quite frankly, I wish it had stayed that way. I immediately felt the throbbing in my head return, and the gentle taps that seemed to be circulating around my entire head went into overdrive. It was more evenly spread now, too. Rather than being in specific locations, it was across what seemed to be the entire circumference of my brain all at once. I could almost*...hear…*it inside me, all the little taps… like crinkling paper.



I sprung up to a sitting position, clutching my face in pain. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness now; what was once pure nothingness had brightened into a shadowy cacophony that ate the corners and walls of the room. The nausea returned, and stars pulsated through my vision, and just then… something caught my eye. 



It sounded in my ears too…coming from the dark, shadowy corner that lay just to the left of me…running smoothly and slowly up the wall. 



I looked over to the source of the noise, which was partially illuminated by the glow of the machinery, and what I saw made my heart drop. Tucked away where the left and back wall met each other was what appeared to be a black, slim, elongated tube of some sort… but no, it wasn't that. I peered closer at it, and I realized the thing had legs… hundreds and hundreds of little tiny legs squirming and latching onto the wall in unison with the noise. 



The thing slowly crawled its way up the room, paying me no attention. Its long body squirmed and wriggled in perfect harmony as it made its way towards the ceiling. 

 I stayed frozen in fear for a few seconds before I immediately launched up from my bed and screamed, practically ripping all the equipment down from where it was standing, unleashing a loud crash.



The doctors stormed into the room and immediately turned on the lights, demanding to know what had happened. I was hysterical. My head was still pounding, it felt like my brain was constrained.



""The-There's something in the corner of the-""



But as I looked to point it out, what I had seen was gone. 



“Kevin… How long did you say you were awake for…?” Dr. Jones asked with concern. “It’s common with severe sleep deprivation that you may experience hallucinations… ”



It made sense, but what I had seen felt so... life-like… I knew that even if this was a hallucination, this wasn't your average run-of-the-mill seeing things. This was… much… deeper. 



The doctors informed me that they would have to cancel the sleep test because my ruckus of throwing everything to the floor managed to break the equipment I was strapped to, so… *yay me*. 



However, They said that they could retrieve all the data up until now and that they would be able to review it as soon as possible. They quickly decided it would be best to move me to a standard hospital room while they awaited my results, but they could barely move me five feet before I started gagging and spilled my stomach contents all over the floor. 



It was then that I finally got a good look at what was coming out of me. It was filled with what looked like… tiny black spheres… I didn't know what to make of it; quite frankly, I was worrying about other things, but it seemed to stun the doctors for a moment, too. However, they quickly got back to the task and escorted me out into the hallway. I didn't see what became of my mess afterward. 



After getting into an admittedly less comfortable hospital bed, I finally had the opportunity to scroll through my phone. It was completely blown up with panicked messages from my mother asking me what was happening and demanding to know why I wasn't answering. I called her back, and the second she saw the medical bed behind me, she nearly exploded into tears. 



“What happened?!” She cried out. 



I explained everything that had been going on since I last called her: the sudden wave of nausea I experienced, calling 9-1-1, and the sleep test. We, or rather, she, came to the conclusion that she would fly down and visit me as soon as possible to hopefully get this whole situation sorted. It was… nice… a silver lining in all this awfulness. At the very least, I was going to be able to see my mother again. 



Doctor Jones interrupted our conversation. After I said one last goodbye to my mother, Jones simply sat down and sighed. He was holding what looked to be a couple of sheets of paper in his hand. 



""Hey, Kevin…"" He started. ""So we've been reviewing your sleep test data as promised, and well…"" He showed me what looked to be a graph with a long squiggly line complete with small valleys and ever-towering hills. ""Your brain waves… they're highly irregular…look."" He began tracing his finger along the figure. ""They are much more active than they should be, even while you're awake… and they nearly go off the graph here when you had your… episode… It's highly alarming."" 



I stared at him in silence, not knowing exactly what to say. ""One thing's for sure; we're going to have to get a head CT done as soon as possible… I'll see how soon I can get you in for an appointment…""



I could barely utter an okay before he left the room, and finally… I completely broke down. This whole thing… It was a massive nightmare. I had no idea why this was happening, and it seemed like even the doctors, the world-class professionals, did not have any semblance of a clue either. I just wanted this all to end; I just wanted to get some sleep finally. I tried to stop… *seeing* that thing in the corner of my eye. But alas, I should’ve known my prayers would all fall on deaf ears. 



A few hours later, Doctor Jones returned and escorted me to the head examination room. It was small and white, with what looked to be some sort of control desk behind a wall in the front and a large machine resembling an MRI taking up most of the space. The machine was making a lot of noise, far more than I had expected.



I lay down on the little bed, feet facing the device and put arms over my head, as the assistant wheeled me into it. I can't lie; I had a certain amount of dread come over me. I knew this was all normal procedure and that it was going to be painless, but something about this was daunting to me. 



Dr. Jones and the others returned to the control area near the entrance and advised me the scan was about to begin. However, I didn't even make it for what seemed like five seconds when there appeared to be distress from the control center, and one of the assistants practically ran out of the room.



My heart began to pound  in my chest as I wondered what was wrong.



Dr. Jones approached me immediately, a grim expression on his face. 



""Listen Kevin…"" He sighed. ""Normally, CT scan results take weeks to get back to you, but we've seen some things here that I believe might have to be taken care of *now.”* 



He ushered me back to the area he had been in during the process and pointed at the computer screen, and I nearly gasped when I saw the image being projected. There was a picture of my head, which was to be expected, but there was something else. Wrapped around it was a long, bug-like creature with two big antennas at the front and an uncountable amount of legs; the whole thing bare resemblance to a giant millipede, yet it was slightly fatter and was long enough to cover the entire circumference of the brain twice. There was something else, though; that… creature… looked precisely like the one I had been seeing in my hallucinations, albeit a bit smaller. 



My heart lurched in my chest as I stared at the unnerving image. I was feeling sick to my stomach, but not due to the illness this time. 



“What the *hell?!”* I exclaimed. 



""Yeah…"" Dr. Jones commented. ""I have no idea where this came from; I've never seen anything like it before… but we're going to have to get that thing out of you pretty fast.""



I could only bob my head in agreement, still lost in my thoughts. This… thing… had been sitting inside me for god knows how long… was *that* what I felt when I experienced that tapping inside my head…? was it that thing… *crawling around up there?* 



As if on cue, it started again, circling all around me. I paid closer attention this time, and I could really feel it—all those little legs skittering along my head. I immediately dissolved into a blind panic, but that seemed to make it pick up the pace. 



It almost seemed… excited… or stimulated in some way. 



My headache returned, and I collapsed to the ground, my fear briefly forgotten. Doctor Jones stood up to help me back to my feet and looked at me with a concerned expression. 



""Look, Kevin… I'll try to schedule surgery to get this thing removed as soon as possible… until then… just try not to think about it too hard… okay?""  



*Don't think about it too hard.*



That was easier said than done; how was I supposed to go back to my room and pretend this *thing* hadn't just made its home up there? My terror got worse as I was ushered back to my room. I still felt it the whole time… it had gotten active recently, and my symptoms were starting to flare up again. 



I was overwhelmed with illness the second I got back into my hospital room and immediately sprinted toward the bathroom. The substance I excreted looked the same as before… filled with those… weird black spheres. 



I didn't pay attention to it, though. I was still thinking about that *thing.* It had been real… maybe my visions hadn't been—but that thing had been living inside me this whole time. I tried… desperately to calm myself down and tell myself it would be out in a day. It didn't make it any better. 



After finishing my rounds, I got up weakly and stared at myself in the mirror. 



And that’s when I saw it. 



Slightly above my eyebrows, in the middle of my forehead, was what appeared to be a massive bulge. It sat there, completely still. As I looked at it further, I realized it wasn't just that… It was a long, winding… bug-like cylinder that circled itself around my entire head. I could even see the pieces of my hair slightly displaced by the thing as it sheathed beneath them.



I don't know what came over me. But somehow, all worry and tension immediately disappeared. I found my right hand slowly drifting up towards my scalp as if it had a mind of its own. I'd say I tried to stop it, but that would be a lie. It was almost like… like I was in some sort of trance. My mind had gone completely blank as my arm slowly hovered up further toward the anomaly.



Then… I touched it and squeezed it gently. It was soft to the touch, almost like some sort of sponge, but I didn't have much time to register it as it immediately squirmed away, darting out of view and behind my head at a speed that looked similar to a bullet fired from a gun. 



This is what finally ripped me from my state. 



I screamed and leaped backward, almost splitting my head on the bathroom tiles. I sat there breathing heavily for a moment, hyperventilating, nearly crying before I worked up the courage to look back into the mirror.



It was gone. 



I did a complete 360 to make sure, but no matter what angle I checked… it wasn't there anymore. 



My headache intensified once again, and I ran to my bed, curling up in the fetal position, tears streaming from my eyes. I remained like that for hours. The doctors had come in to check on me to see what was wrong… but after I explained what I had seen, they found nothing. Still, their presence helped calm me down a tiny bit. 



That night, I simply lay staring at the ceiling. I don’t think I would’ve been able to sleep even if I didn’t have this odd condition. 



Nothing else happened. But still, it was bad enough. The image of what I saw on the CT scan and what happened to me later in that bathroom was *haunting.* And no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not get that thing out of my head. 



My mom arrived the following morning, and I explained everything to her. She was understandably just about as freaked out as I was, but she relaxed a tad bit when I told her about the doctor's plans to remove what was now being confirmed as a parasite clinging to my brain. 

  


My neurosurgeon, with a team of doctors, an assistant, and my anesthesiologist, came in a few minutes later, announcing that it was time to perform the surgery, and told my parents to remain in the waiting room. With one last hug goodbye we split up, hopefully to see eachother again once this was over. 



""Don't worry. I'm going to take good care of you,"" my anesthesiologist reassured me as she prepared the machine. 



Bright, blinding lights sprang to life as the doctors prepared their tools and laid them out on the table next to me. I knew I wouldn't be feeling any of this, but still, I have to admit, it did give me a small pit in my stomach to see all of the sharp objects that were about to be used.



They stuck an I.V. into my arm and hooked me up to all kinds of equipment, including heart rate and blood pressure monitors. I listened as the rhythmic beeping sprang to life and I tried to ease myself, staring into the piercing lights above. 



""Okay, Kevin,"" my anesthesiologist smiled. Once I set this mask on your face, I want you to count down from ten in your head. I promise you will be asleep before you reach zero.""



With that, she gently placed it over my nose, and I slowly breathed in the chemicals streaming through the tube, and then did as she requested.



I reached the end of my ten-second countdown. I was still awake. I began to worry; nothing around me had changed. I tried to say something, to get up and tell the doctors that I was still there, but the second I tried to move, I realized I couldn't. I was locked in place, bound to the table, completely paralyzed. I couldn't even do so much as wiggle my fingers. 



My heart beat faster in my chest as I looked over at the anesthesiologist who was monitoring my heart rate and other vitals, and thankfully, she seemed to realize something was wrong, too. 



""He's awake,"" she said bluntly, slightly confused as she stared at the monitors in front of her. Don't start yet; I'm going to increase the dosage.""



She turned some nob on the machine connected to my mask, and all of a sudden, I felt an intense surge of the stuff get pushed through the tube, far more potent than it was before, forcing itself into my nose. My paralysis was getting stronger, but I still was not falling asleep. 



I began to panic, as evidenced by the ever-increasing beeping on the monitor beside me. The anesthesiologist started to swear under her breath as she turned the dial up even more, almost bringing it to its max. But nothing was working. I lay there, awake on the table, unable to do or say anything, while the doctors all crowded around me, trying to get me to go under. 



Suddenly, the lights above me went out, and the room went completely dark. All the medical staff blurred into the sides of my vision, still and unmoving. What was once a soundscape filled with the frantic movement of personnel and nurses and the rapid beeping of the heart rate monitor was replaced with complete and utter silence. 



I sat there, breathing heavily, and that thing began to scurry again, rushing as I felt it crawl all around my head. I wanted to throw up. It was incredibly disgusting, and it just wouldn't *stop.* 



There was something else, though. A couple of minutes passed, and something crept through the silence. A soft but noticeable crackling noise came from the far end of the room, something I couldn't see from here, slowly making its way ever closer. 



I stared into the distance in terror as the sound unmistakably began wiggling its way up the foot of the bed before changing slightly, now sounding like small, tiny micro taps on plastic.



It wasn't long before two creepy small antennas became barely visible, peering through the darkness, just into view. A couple seconds later, the head arrived. It was that… *thing…* the same creature I had seen on the CT scan, although it looked much larger.



It continued to work its way up the end of my bed and slithered its way down the other side. I tried to get up, to run, but the paralysis drug that the anesthesiologist had given me was doing its job; I was still stuck, still unable to move. I was left helpless, only able to watch in horror as the thing slowly squirmed its way over onto the bed and up onto my foot. 



The small pins of hundreds of tiny little appendages gently reached my leg. The thing was relaxed, seemingly unphased by all my struggles, as it got closer and closer, gently wrapping its way around my limb. I could look at it now; it definitely resembled a massive millipede, but no exoskeleton existed. Instead, what made up the body seemed to be a pale fleshy mass laced with a pattern of black marks strewn across the entire thing.



It reached my stomach and made a straight beeline for my face. I tried as hard as I could to hold my head back and keep it as far away from this thing as possible, but it was futile. All the while, the back half of it had just crossed over the far bed frame, and I was beginning to feel its writhing tingles all over my body. 



My eyes began watering as it slowly crawled on top of my neck and made contact with my chin, its long antennas now taking up a good chunk of my vision. It was then that I realized that I didn't seem to be wearing my mask anymore. I don't know when it disappeared, but it was missing, which gave that thing the opportunity to reach between my lips with its little front legs and slowly pry open my mouth with a strength I wouldn't believe it had. 



I tried again in vain to turn my head to do *something* to counteract it, but nothing worked. The only movements I made was me shaking like a leaf with the events that were currently transpiring. 



Once the creature had opened my mouth just enough, I gagged as it slowly began to crawl its way inside; I felt every movement of the tiny bug limbs creeping on my tongue, the fleshy mass of a body slowly rubbing against the top of my mouth. I wanted to throw up so badly, to cough, but for some reason, those reflexes weren't working; all I could do was gag over and over again as its long, segmented body maneuvered its way in like a snake shedding its skin.



The head reached the back of my throat and began to work its way up towards the top of my head. As I watched more and more of its body disappear behind my lips, I heard the sound of and then saw more and more of these creatures. Smaller ones began to appear at the sides of the bed and weave their way towards me. Some crawled toward my face; others maneuvered themselves across every square inch of my body. 



I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I began hyperventilating, looking at the scene in front of me with terror; each time I looked, there were more and more of them, seemingly appearing out of thin air, exploring every little nook and cranny of me. A pounding throbbing headache ensued, and above all that I felt that thing, the original parasite, continue to crawl its way around in my brain faster than it ever had before.



I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the nightmare to end and then finally. After what felt like forever, it did. 



The lights above me blared to life, and I launched out of the bed and let out a shriek as I failed my arms around. I nearly smacked the hand of the anesthesiologist dead on as she immediately grabbed hold of my shoulders, trying to ease me back into the bed.



“Easy… easy…” She said 



I wanted to yell at her, but then I realized… everything I had just seen, all those bugs… those *things.* They were gone. It was just me and the doctors in an operating room with a highly rapid heartbeat monitor. 



I took a second to collect my bearings and looked at the mask sitting on the bedside table; they had taken me off the medication. 



I instantly collapsed into tears and begged for my mother.



""We're going to have to try something else…"" One doctor said, ""Removing it isn't going to work if we can't get him under."" 



I nearly tackled my mom when I saw her again and explained everything about my horrible experience in that operating room. 



Dr. Jones came in a couple of minutes later, with a grim expression. ""Listen Kevin… I am sorry about what you just went through. For now, we've decided that we're going to try and give you some anti-parasitic medication and see if that will help your condition. I'd hate to tell you this, but the medical staff is… a little lost right now because you've been infected with a parasite species we've never seen before, so we'll call in some researchers to better understand your condition. 



My mother immediately stood up in protest. “You are *not* going to run experiments on my son!”



Dr. Jones simply looked at her with professionalism. ""They aren't experiments, ma'am… we're just going to study the best course of action to hopefully kill or get this thing out of him. And besides, it's Kevin's choice…""



They both looked at me, and I sighed. I desperately wanted this as far away from me as humanly possible, and so, with nothing left to lose, I accepted. 



The next seven days, my condition didn't get much better. I had been awake for thirteen days at this point. But it was weird because despite how horrible I felt, I still didn’t  need to sleep. I still felt as awake as since this whole thing had begun, and at this point, I had resigned myself to not feeling sleepy ever again until this whole thing was over. 



I requested to spend my nights with my mother because, after my surgery encounter, I didn't want to be lying in my room alone at night, and the presence of my folks helped put me at ease. They even taught me to laugh about it all a little, and as time went on, mysteriously, the hallucinations became slightly more diluted, something which the researchers quickly picked up.



Oh yeah, at this point, I was also being watched by a team of researchers 24/7. I was doing constant tests, scans, the whole deal.



The anti-parasitics they were trying seemed to have no effect. I guess they just hadn't invented one that worked for this specific species yet. 



The next day. One of the researchers came in and told me he had an idea. My symptoms seemed to calm down when I was at a state of ease and flare up when I was stressed or scared so he proposed giving me a high dose of ketoconazole, a medication that's supposed to regulate my stress hormones. 



I tried it for two days, and the scientists' theories were all but confirmed because my hallucinations and all my other symptoms weakened significantly. A subsequent CT scan revealed the thing had grown much smaller than it was before… it was starving. This is what led to the current theory that this thing likely feeds off of stress hormones or other things your body produces during these periods. 



They continued this pattern for the next two days until my symptoms became so mild they almost didn't exist anymore. I was still stuck awake, but everything else had been diluted to an absolute minimum; the parasite on the CT scan looked like a shriveled husk of what it used to be. 



Dr. Jones came into the room that day and delivered a message that almost made my stomach drop. He said that, if possible, he would like to try the surgery again, given that the thing had gotten so weak that the researchers didn't think it could overpower the anesthesia as it did before. 



I halted for a moment; on the one hand, I was eager to be done with this, but on the other… I didn't want to relive what I had before. Dr. Jones assured me that they would be starting with a very low dose, and if they didn't notice an effect, they would immediately call off the operation. 



After a long debate between my parents and the doctors, we decided to proceed. 



Thankfully, the surgery went off without a hitch. 



When I came too, I finally saw the thing that had caused me all this trouble with my own eyes; it was dead, lying on the bedside table fully stretched out. It looked the same as what I saw in my hallucinations, albeit a lot smaller. 



I even got to name the damn thing. ""Neural Sleep Parasite"" Had an excellent ring to it. Before long, they hauled off that thing for further study, and I never saw it again. 



They explained to me that I had most likely ingested its eggs when drinking that coffee back in the library, and that, combined with the high-stress response, allowed it to sort of take over my brain for a while. 



But I cut them off. I didn't want to hear more about this. I was done. 



Or so I thought. 



Because immediately after a big scare I will not get into and jumping under covers back home… my tiredness… vanished…



I began to panic but forced myself to think clearly. 



They said I ingested its eggs with that coffee… what if there was more than one… or what if it had laid more while it was inside me? Come to think of it, those odd black spheres coming out of me all the time were… unsettling; I just never thought to bring it up because there was always something else of critical importance happening…



I’m writing this now with a piercing headache, as all of my symptoms are beginning to rush back.

We have two 20 amp outlets on the same circuit in our kitchen. One our fridge is plugged with into and the other has our air fryer, coffee maker & electric kettle plugged in. (There's another outlet on the circuit that's not used regularly.) Lately when using the air fryer the display would flicker and the device it self would flicker like it's having power problems. We just assumed it was a shitty air fryer and started looking for a new one. Flash forward to a few weeks ago and it did it again but then shut off entirely and everything else on that circuit lost power. My husband went to check the breaker box and the breaker wasn't tripped. He flipped it off and thought maybe he heard a sizzling noise but he's not sure. He then checked all the outlets on the circuit and when he took the one the air fryer etc is plugged into off, he noticed the ground was loose so he fixed it. When he turned the breaker back on, everything was on and working so he figured the loose ground was the issue. He rechecked all the outlets with a multimeter and got 120v AC on all of them.  Things worked fine for a few weeks so we thought the issue was fixed but it happened again tonight. What could be causing the issue?

1gt3pj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lucanismancers/comments/1gt3pj9/withdrawal_chapter_1/,Withdrawal Chapter 1,"Note: This is a LucanisxFemRook fanfic that was inspired by u/PunkinPumpkin work “In Spite of You” (link in the megathread because I am failing at linking right now). I highly recommend you read their work first since this fic contains a couple of references the their work. 

This story takes place in when Rook is trapped within Solas’ Prison and focus’ on how Lucanis and Spite dealt with her loss up until they reunited. Also characters that appear in the lighthouse are based on my own game state when I played through this section of the game. 

Anyway, without further ado, please enjoy the first chapter of Withdrawal. 

————————————————————————

It was a strange sensation. The crow had been living in the fade for months now, but hadn’t experienced any dreams. 

He had to admit that was partially his own doing, forcing himself to stay awake with discipline, coffee, and the sheer spite he held for his unwelcome demon. And though he wouldn’t admit it out loud to anyone else but her…fear. 

Of course there was only so much he could do to stave off the exhaustion. He may be the Demon of Vyrantium, but even he couldn’t conquer sleep and would lose consciousness. During those times he experienced nothing. No darkness or calm, but lapses of time. One moment he was awake writing his in his log or sharpening his blades, the next he would be in another place entirely. He’d gasp for air and have a searing headache. Mierda, did Spite not breathe when he possessed him?! Was it because he was demon who didn’t need to breathe, or was it out of pure spite to torture him like this as punishment for not letting him out. 

Whatever the case, Lucanis hated the sensation whenever it happened. He’d managed it for a year dealing with Spite. The demon was persistent, but he found ways to keep him at bay. Usually by ignoring his presence unless it was necessary. Things were different now though. He no longer felt that he needed to keep Spite in check as often. The demon had lessened his possession attempts of late. Lucanis even found himself more open to engaging with him too now that they understood one another better. He had to admit that Spite was much easier to tolerate than he’d expected. Perhaps it was thanks to her influence on the both of them. She had done the unthinkable getting them closer to one mind. It seemed the demon had become calmer whenever she was around to humor him as well. 

Spite was still mischievous of course. Often pestering and whining to him about when the next time she’d come around the pantry for a visit. Spite would also on occasion, get excited randomly and tease Lucanis with new vulgarities the he’d had picked up. Although it annoyed him, Lucanis couldn’t exactly get angry at the demon. Spite was after all, feeding off his own unconscious thoughts and feelings. It was his own desires being thrown back at his face and made him all the more flustered. It was even worse when she started to pick up on them too. 

Somehow, despite not hearing or seeing the demon, the two somehow managed to bond over pushing his buttons. There were times he even suspected that perhaps they were  conspiring with one another. But he knew better than to assume that. Rook was just too observant for her own good. She was good at seeing right through people, especially him, and he didn’t quite know how to handle that yet.

Lucanis, however, was still grateful for this strange arrangement the three of them shared. He found himself feeling much more at ease. More relaxed  than he had felt in a long time. When Spite did take over, it wasn’t exactly pleasant, but the lapses didn’t hurt as much.  He also got to look forward to Rook’s company keeping him grounded afterward. 

But this was different. There was no lapse. This time he was conscious, or at least he thought so? 

He felt off balance and disoriented. It was as if his body was suspended in the air, hanging from unseen strings. His senses dulled. He couldn’t move or speak, but could see and feel. The air around him felt dense, his vision hazy as if looking through a thick fog. It unnerved him how much his senses were subdued by these strange surroundings. Was this the fade? 

What did come through clearly was a scream.

“LET ME OUT!”

Lucanis could hear Spite roaring from behind him. A chained beast lashing out against his restraints. A strange sensation washed over him as he felt a sudden force pushing him back. It nearly knocked the wind out of him. 

“SHE’S STUCK! LET. ME. FIND. HER!”

The pressure became more intense. He could also hear a mix of other familiar voices as well, but they were distant and harder to hear. These voices sounded as if they were struggling against something, desperately trying to keep something contained. They were nearly drowned out by Spite’s ravings. 

“GET OFF ME!”

“Hurry up! Hold him down!”

The pressure shifted and the crow felt as if hands were gripped tightly on his shoulders, pushing him down on his back. Instinctually he tried to break from the grip but found he had no strength. 

“WE NEED HER!”

“He’s stronger than he looks! Bellara I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up!”

“WE NEED ROOK!”

“Hold him still!”

“NOT GOING BACK!”

A new sensation wrapped around his wrists tightly. Whatever it was, it was painful and tightened as the voices grew louder. He wanted to scream. Tell them to stop, but his voice betrayed him as he made no sound. 

“Taash do something!”

“NOT ALONE AGAIN!”

“Can’t you see I’m fu—ing trying!?”

“YOU WON’T HOLD ME BACK!”

“Almost there!”

Now his legs were restrained and he could feel the same tightening grips around his ankles. He felt as if he were being pulled apart! His voice again would not come out! When would it stop?!

“GET OFF!”

“Emmrich do it now!”

Then there was silence and all went dark…

1gt3ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1gt3ngz/problems_eating_when_around_people/,Problems eating when around people?,"The title might sound confusing so I want to elaborate as much as I can. So, I live only with my mother and I’m pretty close with her I guess. I eat all the time when she is at home. But, I’ve noticed whenever I go out with friends, I can barely eat. An example from a day ago is when I went out for lunch with a friend. I was at their apartment and we were watching a movie. While doing so, we ordered a large pizza and some breaded mushroom things. I was very hungry since I had breakfast 3 or 4 hours ago and the only other food I had in the mean time was a single Little Debbie Honey Bun with half a cup of coffee. When we got the food, I was able to eat the first slice just fine and a couple of the mushrooms. However, once I started eating a second slice, I could barely finish it. Since my issue with not being able to finish food would happen in the past, I would think about it again and I started to feel a knot in my stomach. I felt not sick enough that I wanted to throw up but just uncomfortable, like I needed to get some fresh air or something. For the entire 2 hours of watching the movie, I was just sitting there in discomfort, constantly thinking about the food. At that point, even the smell of the food started to make me feel ill. After the movie was finished, I went to bathroom and I couldn’t help but just keep coughing. This sort of thing always happens when I eat around people except my mother. I can’t understand why and it’s becoming really annoying. It’s hard to go out with friends because I start worrying about eating and the thought of eating starts to already make me feel anxious. Does anyone have a similar issue or is this something related to some besides anxiety or stress. I guess I should also mention I have OCD and I have a fast metabolism. I thought I should mention these things if they’re related possibly.",4,1731810883.0,Anxietyhelp,5,0.84,False

I was 70 yo and figured, after a few short-term arrangements via SA, that my SD days were about over. I had regular morning coffee at a Waffle House near my home. My waitress most mornings was a cute 24 yo single mom. We talked mostly about the difficulties of a single parent (I was a single Dad). One morning I said she was so cute I would like to adopt her. She said she had a father. I said that was okay because I wanted to be her daddy. She knew immediately what I meant. We agreed to meet for drinks and dinner the next weekend when her ex had the kids. She was my SB for almost two years.

If you want to freestyle….be personable, don’t rush, listen to her for a common experience and an opening. Do not be shy. Tell her what you want and why. 

Last but not least, the older I get the easier it is to freestyle. Maybe the ladies think I am less of a threat, or less demanding, or more like their dad (or granddad). But I think it is mostly because I am open, honest, and not concerned if I get rejected. And I am generous, but not extravagant. That counts too.

“What the heck?  What the fuck?  When?  sputters Maria as her eyes follow her son’s direction.  “If you told me earlier, I’d’ve been here earlier,” and that, dear MIL, had that been a question, would have been self-explanatory.  She’s not angry because “God doesn’t make mistakes” unlike her paternity test gift to Justine so now she knows this is her do-over.  But with Maria’s arrival, the forecast is partly sunny with clouds moving in for a decent chance of rain on someone’s parade.  Justine suspects Maria has something up her sweatered sleeve and she might be right as Maria swears never to contradict her or disrespect her . . . in front of the kids.  Around the darkened corner, however, “if things don’t go the right way, I’m going to step in.”  But as she reaches for the laundry, DIL steps in with her house rules and how she likes things done and that’s a good time to ask the burning question, “Whose idea was it to keep a secret from me”?  What a damned-if-you-do and dead-if-you-don’t speed bump so easily sidestepped moment.  And it is, segueing into Sherry’s probable reaction whose rocky history with her daughter’s impetuous decisions and Montana’s, “The plan is just to leave it in God’s hands” understandably elicits a WTF throwing-hands-up-in-the-air stalking off reaction.  It’s been nice living on the other side of the country.  Death can wait for a final halcyon delivery.  *I’m not saying you have too many kids, but it’s a vagina, not a clown car.*

No coffee serving, no rides, and no back rubs – Daniel’s life will be death by a thousand little cuts, and to add insult to injury, Bianca is cooking eggs vigorously without any fats not allowing the heat to denature the unfolded proteins to bind and curdle. While he gags, bravely trying to down the superfood’s nutrients, the chef chides him for being unappreciative of anything she does.  She scrapes the eggs off the plate and into the trash paralleling her treatment of Daniel, and guess what?  Hailey is coming to visit.  Tomorrow.  “Is it ok”?  “It’s kinda’ late.""  What can I expect”?  Doing the dishes.  Again.   Never mind.  They’re going on a double date with Conner, “Gator” as he’s known in the yard, and his enviable officially engaged-with-a-ring, for there is no other way to be engaged, fiancée, Celeste (unaccountably pronounced Celes-tay). 

First things first.  Daniel’s idea of lovemaking being two perfunctory kisses and a thuggish positioning of Bianca’s body to jackhammer her somewhere in the conjunction of the vulva above the urethra.  Finding the clitoris is harder than finding Waldo.  It’s a *maize* down there like trying to find shell-less littleneck clams in a tangle of spaghetti or picking those pesky hidden raisins in an otherwise lovely rice pudding.  Why, a man needs a AAA treasure map to mark the route from base camp A to X marks the spot, but that’s not quite what Kimber, the Somatic Intimacy Coach has in mind.  She is that prototypical middle-aged New Agey-looking woman wearing Native American turquoise and beads signaling her oneness with the universe.  Her mini gallery wall framed by the names and functions of The Vestibular Glands and The Labia fascinates Daniel.  Their goal: better sex = more physical and emotional intimacy and less crises, but instead of following the yellow brick road to Oz, he and Bianca are seated on the floor straddling each other asking and answering the same questions with a thank you for each answer.  “What do you desire?  “Better sex.”  “You being ok with me doing the little things that bother you.”  “Huh, I don’t even know what that means.”  (Nor do I.)  Moving on.  “What are you afraid of?  You leaving me and my drinking affecting our relationship.”  “You never seeing the potential I see in you.”  “What do you love about me?  “Your abs, your strength;” “How passionate you are about your writing.  Your letters to me in prison got me through tough times and to the love that brought us here.”  “What is your relationship status?  Boyfriend/girlfriend.”  “No.”  “Yes, because if you were engaged, you’d have a ring on your finger.”  “You asked me to marry you while you were in prison, though.”  “I did and meant it then; but now, fiancée doesn’t sit right.”

After that there should’ve been a tantric workshop afterglow; however, the couple finds their way to Mill’s Modern Social for a double date night, and right off the bat Conner’s sense of humor and unsolicited but smart advice prompts a “Not a fan of Gator” remark.  While the two women repair to the bar where the predictable cran vodka ameliorates Bianca’s throat, so her venting slides off more smoothly, Gator explains that he didn’t propose until their second anniversary.  He advises Daniel to consider the age gap, their mutual expectations, and a trial living together to ensure their mutual commitment because he immediately clocked her and his advice was, “You need to fucking run, dude!”  *Keep pouring bartender, it’s still Monday.*

Louie knows his woman as well as he knows his pizza.  Melissa wants to shout her engagement from the rooftops and let the rainbow colors and white light flash off her 2-carat diamond as intently as the firestorm of daggers erupting from Donna’s bloodshot eyes at the family dinner soiree Louie has arranged that night at the 26 West on the Navesink on the Jersey shore.    But it’s only those three as well as Melissa's dad, the cadaverous Ron who looks as though a swear word would blow him over.  She and Louie are expecting an abundance of interjectory plaudits, but crickets except for Donna’s low-key, “Yo, dude, what is this”? and an unexpected request to take it off for Inspector Gadget’s appraisal.  “Welcome to my family,” she says with an eye-roll pun that couldn’t be any cornea.  Donna might not be showing any emotion on the outside, but she’s exploding on the inside.  Yes, she’s happy for them, but she’s unhappy her son is being led away like Delilah did Samson and Eve did Adam although, technically it's already happened.  Louie tries to explain that her and Melissa’s roles are different so there is no competition, and that although her lifelong worry was cultivated through his actions, it’s time for her to let go and relax.  “Why,” she asks.  She tells Melissa, “I spoke with my mother and sister, and they all like you and don’t understand why I don’t like you, but I don’t like you because you’re too much like me,” the several time divorcée, and the ultimate insult even worse than hating her!  Donna praises her son for the man he’s become and then asks, “If you fall, will she support you?  Louie feels guilty; he caused this panic in her, and Melissa doesn’t respond except to turn slightly to the side to reveal the tip of her nose that looks like it was caught in the middle of cookie dough batter starting to be creamed.  *Thou shalt not try me.  Mood 24.7.*

Joey and Kim are inspecting an adequate $215K home with two lots that are $30K more than anticipated with Kim’s $1600 PM salary and a mortgage payment of $1500 PM, not counting a 3.5 % down payment.  What to do?  Why have a yard sale of boys' used shoes and toys AND ask Poppa Edward if they can “borrow” $7K when he drives up wearing shorts because all the $$$ he loaned them didn’t leave him enough to pay for the extra material it would have taken to make his long pants.  Edward is such an easy mark because he loves his daughter and grandsons more than he distrusts Joey, so he inserts the caveat of not putting Joey’s name on the lease.  Now, Joey doesn’t mind working as long as it's work he enjoys and that pays what he considers a decent enough salary for him to dress and leave the house daily - unlike the rest of us who have no choice.

Kim feels bad about using her father as the local ATM, so they go to the Skyla Credit Union to open an account because Kim finally put her foot down on Joey’s unlimited use of her debit card; for that, however, they need identification and credit histories to show Laboris, the bank manager.  Joey can’t find the former and doesn’t have the latter though he has this to say about that: He’s been a responsible drug dealer.  Selling dope is a damn hard job when you’re doing it illegally; not the same as, say for a pharmacist.  Kim wants Joey to get his phone to complete the enrollment and is as curious as to why he left it in the car as his recent behavior, exhaustion, and temperature yo-yo-ing.  While he’s gone, she asks Laboris about dollar limits on a checking account. She can have an overdraft courtesy pay option of $2K daily but that’s too much.  She can get alerts for his transactions which will have to do as much as she’s been tracking everything else about him.  He comes back saying he can’t find his phone and he doesn’t like being controlled, not realizing it’s about the budget, stupid. 

And what does this vaping mushroom t-shirt-wearing clodhopper do right after this but go ‘window shopping’ at the Tint World Styling Center?  (Can you say rims?)   Kim worries now that he may be siphoning off her funds and she fusses at him until he calls Nahim, a sketchy friend from the past, to pick him up, but he returns home plopping into bed and sleeping for 12 hours straight almost missing church.  That leaves time for Kim to confide her concerns to Tammy, his mother, who doesn’t know if her son is on drugs and can only continue praying for him.  If Momma doesn’t know, who does?  When Joey wakes up sick, he only wants to drive himself to Urgent Care although that may mean different things to them both.  He tears away turning off the camera in his car expostulating, “I want to be away and see what’s wrong with me because no one can control what I do.  I gotta do what I gotta do.""  Meanwhile, Kim still proclaims love with every fiber of her being so it will hurt when she picks her children over him because she’s decided to be a parent first.  She might have been more believable had she not introduced this reckless man into their lives at all.  *Okay!!! I’m ready for my next mistake.  Who’s single?  Or married?  Or a man?*

I came out of school at 18 into that shitty 2008 economy, could not get a permanent god damn job in like 9 years i had 9 months with one shop, 3 months with another, 9 months work placement program.      I eventually picked up a job in a fish factory, was sacked on 3rd week \[i sucked and someone else apparently had 10 years experience coming on to replace me\]. asked back 3 weeks later for a week to lend a hand \[i assumed the new contracts where too much for the new guy that replaced me but he had been sacked\] .  . I ultimately ended back there for roughly over 4 years.       the job screwed up my hands \[I suspect carpal tunnel but my nation is IRELAND so 7 - 8 years now still no diagnosis or treatment\]  hands are next to useless, and severe loss of strength in arms also. got so bad had to pack in the job and i loved the job

Ive been unemployed now for 3 years no income, \[because i mentally could not deal with welfare services, so lived off savings. stupid and self destructive but like i say i have issues \]   

applying for shitty jobs like years ago and same shit all over again not even getting interviews. \[bare in mind id been applying for jobs 2 years before i ultimately had to pack in that job in the fish factory. so 5 years, ive had 1 interview in all that time\]

If i had not had to leave that job, id of had 40-50% the price of a home \[would be old home in bad area but would be a secure home all the same\] in savings by now and couldve stood a chance at a mortgage \[im only allowed 70k mortgage by official rules but that couldve been stretched to 120k under special exemption\]       

I do have some mental issues, such as for some god knows reason i have what can only be described as a god damn phobia of tea / coffee and other hot drinks, sight of them makes me uncomfortable. touching a container with them or that has contained them is like mental torture, god forbid i get some on me, i can scrub scrub and scrub the disgust/discomfort lasts an excessively long period of time.        the only option for shit like this tends to be exposure therapy and i tried, it never eased off the issue.    so working as assistant or in a coffee shop or even fast food is not that viable for me, id likely freak the feck out at some point and would be very mentally uncomfortable but ive applied for jobs in fast food and reception / assistant etc all the same as this is life you have to try SUCK IT UP and DEAL WITH SHIT.                 this is obviously a highly embarrassing thing to admit, like phobias of the dark, snakes, dogs, heights those all make god damn sense.  where the hell my discomfort around tea /coffee in particular came from i have no idea and it makes feck all sense. 

Ive always had social anxiety and general anxiety and these are crippling me at the moment, Like i walked into a store there couple weeks back and just had to turn around and walk out, just complete mental breakdown of function / overwhelmed me.      Ive also started to develop a god damn stutter / speech impediment.       Im just hoping if i manage to pick up some work I can hold my shit together. 

thats my pathetic life story thus far. I really wish i could just be better / do better.  Im 34 in a few days and im still living with my parents and making feck all progression in life.      all my issues are my own fault obviously but that doesnt make me feel less shitty.

Although I am very aware at how good ive had things and even when i eventually end up homeless well id be homeless in a western nation, thats still a luxury life compared to the shit a hell of a lot of other people have to put up with in the world.

Six miles into the hike and she was still bounding with energy while I neared the brink of collapse. 

*bang bang bang bang*

Taking no notice of the pounding that had just drifted through the trees, she paused to allow me to catch up with her, and teased me for becoming an old man. Our tenth time making the trek—an annual tradition to return to the place where I’d proposed—and she looked as beautiful as she had on the first. 

*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*

It was louder now—enveloping us. Desperately I tried to ignore it too—fighting to stay in the moment—fighting to stay with her. I knew what was waiting if I gave in…

*BANG BANG BANG*

“Fuck…”

I opened my eyes, and she was gone. 

And I was back… *there…*

Light bringing no warmth streamed in through the window, and I shivered, uselessly pulling the meager, moth-bitten sheets tighter to my body. 

A full month’s worth of frigid mornings had taught me to expect the chill air forcing its way through the cracks in the crumbling, plaster walls, which brought with it the scent of fresh snow.

“And so continues the endless winter in Hell…” I grumbled, half-awake, as I reached blindly towards the bedside table and wrapped my hand around the glass that I knew would be waiting there—full to the brim with poisonous medicine.

Swallowing its entire contents in two large gulps, I gagged on the flavor of tepid, watered-down, cheap whiskey—potent enough to keep the shakes at bay, yet not quite so strong as to bring any measure of real peace. At least its pain-numbing qualities exceeded those of the booze in the outside world—allowing me to choke back the tears brought on by my shattered back.

*BANG BANG BANG BANG*

The cacophony that had woken me continued down on the first floor. 

From the sound of it, our new arrival was still violently trying to come to terms with his new living arrangements—angrily shouting, pounding on the walls, and, based on the scraping and then the loud crashes that followed, attempting to hurl the dining room chairs through the windows. 

“Henri will be furious about having to rebuild those again…” I murmured. 

I took another swig from the glass that, by then, had refilled itself, and listened more closely to the man’s words. With only two semesters of college Spanish under my belt, it was some time before I recognized anything that he was screaming.

“¡¿Dónde está la puerta?!” was the only thing I picked out that I fully understood. 

‘It will return soon enough.’ I thought to myself, polishing off my second helping of swill, and setting the glass back on the table—feeling the weight of those words more heavily given the events of the last couple days. 

‘Best not focus on that part, though.’ I shuddered, propping my back up against the metal bars of the headboard and reaching once again for my only comfort in *there*—topped off, as it was, for a third time. 

Confined to my bed for the foreseeable future, I heard Henri’s door open and his footsteps thump passed mine as I knew, for the third day in a row, he was going to attempt and calm the fresh tenant. 

And, watching the haggard, dirty, broken man in the mirror that faced the bed raise the glass once again to his lips, I reflected back on my first day in The Winter House. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Two years. 

It was two years to the day that I lost Sherry.

It had all happened so quickly. 

We were on our anniversary hike when, for the first time in our relationship, she fell behind me; then, without warning, collapsed in the middle of the trail.  

Hospital visits, tests, diagnosis, treatment, fighting, losing, withering. 

Dead. 

Six months—that’s all it took. Thirty-seven years of healthy existence, ten years of happy marriage—so much life still left in front of her.

Dead.

Every time I closed my eyes, I could still hear the high-pitched squeal of the machine announcing to me that her heart had stopped when I felt the last of her strength evaporate from the hands I was holding. 

For the next two years, I tried to carry on without her—did everything I knew to pull myself out of the swirling pit of despair I’d dropped into the moment she stopped breathing. Friends, family, hiking, lifting, church—I even debated going to therapy, but my father had always told me that that was only for weak men. 

Every day, I fell deeper into the hole, and every day, the bottle loomed nearer. 

You see, Sherry and I had met in Alcoholics Anonymous. She was already three months sober at the time, and comforted me on my very first day—helped see me through the worst of my detox, kept me going back to meetings, became my biggest advocate. 

We were two broken souls that had enough pieces left to hold each other together, and once she was gone, mine was shattered once more. 

But she had made me promise that I would keep my sobriety in her absence—made me swear it on the ring she’d worn on her hand every day of our marriage, and that I then wore around my neck every day after her passing. 

Yet, one night, I found myself in a bar. 

A bar I’d been to many, many times in my pre-Sherry life. A bar so familiar that, though I hung my head in shame, the feet I was watching carried me to a stool that, even after years of my neglect, still felt like home when I sat in it. And, without me uttering a single word, a drink appeared in front of me. 

Double-whiskey, on the rocks—the bartender winked and asked where I’d been before shuffling off to take another patron’s order. Staring at the ice cubes suspended in the amber pour of my failure, I apologized to Sherry before downing it in one practiced motion. 

Five more helpings of the same tonic at the bar, and a stop at the liquor store on the way home, and I was feeling the best that I had in a long while. In fact, it was the only time in the last two years that I hadn’t felt the crushing weight of Sherry’s death bearing down on my chest, and I was experienced enough to know that the minute I sobered up again, the pain of her loss would return even more intensely than before. 

So, I decided that night, on the walk between the liquor store and my house, that I was never going to be sober again. My plan was to continue drinking in every waking minute of every hour of every day of the remainder of my life, until my liver finally would give out on me.  

And, in that instant, I felt an incredible sense of relief. 

Everything seemed so simple then—I was a locksmith who worked for himself, so I didn’t need to worry about being fired for intoxication. All I needed to do from then on would be to make enough money to afford my rent, utilities, food, and booze while I waited for death to take me.

What I did not know, at the time, was that I’d just made myself a target.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When I arrived home that evening, I immediately stumbled my way into the kitchen and grabbed a plastic cup from the cabinet. Given I was already nearly toppling over with each step, I was certain I’d shatter anything glass if I tried to use it, and therefore was more than happy to fill my NASCAR chalice with a heavy dose of whiskey and ice. 

The next hour or so, I melted into the couch watching trash TV—working myself halfway through the fifth I’d purchased. It wasn’t long before I passed out—empty vessel in hand—dreamlessly fading into nothing. 

I awoke with a headache around three in the morning needing to pee fiercely and, stupidly, I tried to sprint to the restroom—kicking the coffee table on the way there. Blind pain seared through what I imagined was likely a broken pinkie toe on my right foot, necessitating that I limp the rest of my way to the toilet in our master bathroom. 

After I’d finished my business, I debated brushing my teeth and laying down in bed for the rest of the night, but with the way my head was feeling, I knew that if I didn’t get some more alcohol into my system before I fell asleep again, the morning would horrendous. And walking back out into our bedroom, I caught sight of something I hadn’t noticed when I’d crossed through the space with my eyes bleary from the tears of my shattered toe. 

There was a glass on my bedside table. 

Brimming with a brown liquid and ice effortlessly floating through it—tinkling softly as the cubes moved up and down—it appeared as if someone had just placed it down a moment ago. 

I blinked repeatedly to make sure it didn’t disappear, but after closing my eyes and opening them for the fourth time, I resigned myself to its reality and focused then on how it could have gotten there. 

As I mentioned, I was only planning to drink out of my plastic cup for the evening. Moreover, as far as I was aware, I’d been knocked out on the couch until about five minutes prior. ‘Had it been there when I came into the room initially?’ I pondered. ‘It must have been unless there was someone else in the house with me…’

My heartrate increased considering the possibility that someone had invaded my home, and I stood stock-still for a minute, listening intently for the sound of any other movement in the house. But all that met my ears was the gentle clink of the ice, which I felt should have settled by that time. Yet, when I looked back at the table, it was impossibly still stirring—as if disturbed by an unseen hand. 

Grabbing a baseball bat from the closet, I planned then to search the house and started first by checking that I had, in my drunken stupor, remembered to lock the front door. Sherry and I had had a break-in a couple years before she passed and I had personally installed a special deadbolt that used keys which I’d made myself. Of those keys there were only two in existence, and of those two I retained sole possession. So, when I reached the door and found that I had indeed thrown the bolt behind me when I’d returned home earlier, I relaxed slightly. 

Confident that no one could have picked the lock and entered through the main entrance, I conducted a thorough search of the remainder of the modest domicile. In doing so, I established that all other doors and all of the windows were locked, sealed, and undamaged and I detected no trace of anyone besides myself within the walls. 

I was alone. 

So, I returned to my bedroom, praying as I crossed the threshold that the beverage would simply have vanished, and I could chalk the whole thing up to a hallucination. 

But I was sorely disappointed. 

There it still stood, solid as the moment I first laid eyes on it—ice continuing to bob up and down. The only explanation that I had for its presence, then, was that I had woken up (or maybe even sleep-walked) sometime before I had arisen to pee, made myself the drink, placed it down next to my bed, and wandered back to the couch. 

‘But why in the fuck would I do that?’ I confusedly considered. 

If that had been what happened, I would have had to have done it very recently as the ice looked un-melted. And it seemed so odd that I wouldn’t have drunk any of it before heading back to the living room. However, as it was the only explanation I could come up with that made any sense to me, and given I had been on my way to the kitchen to fix another drink before I spotted the one already waiting for me, I begrudgingly accepted that it must be the truth—brushing off the concerns that kept popping up in my head. 

With that, I approached the table and saw that as I did, my footsteps shook the contents—answering for me how it had appeared to be in a constant state of disturbance. I had been stomping around the house and creating the vibrations that were making it look alive. 

So easily, I ignored all of my worries. So easily, I lifted the glass from the table.

So easily, I took a sip…

And…

It was euphoria.

The most delicious drink that had ever passed my lips. In fact, the most delicious thing I’d ever consumed in my life. Far beyond the quality of the piss I knew to be sitting in the plastic bottle in the kitchen that it should have tasted like. 

But I didn’t care. 

I could not stop myself. 

Down, down, down; I gulped its entirety down in a wild frenzy. Unable to move from the spot, unable to care for anything else—I ate the ice—I licked the inner walls of the glass clean—I was about to bite down on the glass itself when I snapped out of it.

For a moment, I felt nothing. But then, as I lowered the empty container from my face, I was struck with an intense surge of pleasure. Every nerve ending tingled with warmth—every pain I’d ever known drifted away—Sherry’s hollow, sickened face dissolved from my memories and was replaced with the smile that greeted my mornings for so many years. 

I needed more.

And, as if a bartender had heard my thoughts, I looked down to see the glass was full again. 

Madly, I snatched it up—draining the elixir even faster than the first helping. And I was rewarded. I began tingling with the sensations of every joyous minute I’d ever experienced—the best days of my life all flashed before my eyes—the smell of Sherry’s perfume crept into my nostrils. 

At that moment, I was positive that I was happiest being on the planet.

While I basked in bliss, a voice rose from the back of my mind, carrying with it only one word. 

“MORE!” It demanded. 

The glass was full again. 

And the third dose barely lasted a second.

I felt Sherry’s arms around my waist—wrapping me in a hug from behind. The weight of her head pressed down on my shoulder and she pulled me gently down onto the bed. Lovingly, she ran her fingers through my hair, and whispered tenderly in my ear. 

“Don’t worry—I’ve got you now.” 

It was so sweet to hear her voice again, so sweet to feel her warmth beside me. 

“I’ve got you now.” She repeated, yet this time, the tenderness was gone.  

This time, a darkness filled each syllable. 

Panic replaced ecstasy, but I was helpless to do anything about it. Overwhelming exhaustion overcame me, and I was forced, powerlessly, into a heavy and dreamless slumber. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Sunlight shone on the inside of my eyelids, and I cracked them open to find it was morning. Nothing about my bedroom appeared different than any other time I’d woken up there, besides that it was absolutely freezing for the middle of summer. Yanking the covers closer to me, I cocooned myself to attempt and warm my bones, but it was to little avail.

A pounding headache prevented the events of the previous evening from returning to me immediately, but when I rotated my head to look at the clock on the bedside table, there was an empty space on it that I knew, for some reason, should have been occupied. 

The glass was gone.

It all came back to me and I, with a start, sat up in bed—quickly to be greeted with an incredible bout of nausea. 

Frantically, I ran for the restroom and began to vomit so furiously, I worried that I might not just expel what was inside my stomach, but actually launch my stomach itself into the toilet. It was the most miserable I had ever felt—a hangover so severe that I legitimately considered calling for an ambulance. You would have thought that in that instant, I’d be swearing off alcohol forever. Yet in reality, once I felt assured that I had nothing left inside my body to chuck up, the first thing I did was crawl, like a baby, to the kitchen to find my leftover whiskey from the night before. 

Any alcoholic can tell you that the fastest way to cure alcohol withdrawal is to consume more alcohol. 

So, with trembling hands, I snatched the half empty bottle down from the counter and, forgoing any imitations of sophistication, took two large pulls directly from it. I gagged and my stomach churned—it took every ounce of my fortitude to keep it down, but I was able to hold it. Sitting on the floor, I leaned against a cabinet and continued to take small sips every few minutes while I waited for it to take effect. And gradually, I began to feel the hangover symptoms subsiding. 

Once I was able to focus on anything other than feeling horribly ill, I thought again about the night before—about the mysterious glass. About how… perfect… it had made me feel. With its conspicuous absence that morning, I wondered if it had all been a very lucid dream—maybe it really had been a hallucination brought on by the binge I’d gone on after such a long period of sobriety. 

Whatever the case, as the whiskey displaced more and more of the healthy ingredients of my blood, I focused less on the, likely, imagined events of the night before, and more on my growing hunger. With that sensation returning, I knew that I would be feeling well enough to stand and hauled myself to my feet. 

Swaying a bit more than I expected, I continued to take intermittent gulps of drink as I managed to fumble my way through a shower, teeth brushing, and getting dressed, so that I could at least head out to get a shitty fast-food breakfast and another bottle for the afternoon. 

Then, stepping out through the front door, I closed it behind me, and turned my key in the deadbolt to lock it. But when I spun it back to the center position to remove it from the door, it got stuck. 

Yanking on it as hard as I could, it refused to pull free from the lock. I tried jiggling it a bit, but couldn’t shake it loose. Then, I tried twisting it back to the locked position, but it wouldn’t budge that direction either. 

Annoyed, I was about to head to my truck to grab some of my smithing tools to force it to come out, when something… happened…

The key rotated on its own to unlock the door. 

I stared at it in disbelief for a moment—there was no way that should have been possible. Even if someone was standing on the other side of the door and had spun the deadbolt handle, it wouldn’t have moved the key externally. 

Confused, but significantly inebriated such that I was more frustrated than scared at the time, I tried to turn it back to lock the door again, but found it was now frozen in the unlocked position. 

Unsure of what to make of the situation, I decided to open the door to begin investigating the entire mechanism when I was met with a sight that I’ll never forget. 

My living room was gone. 

Instead, the door had opened to reveal the dingiest interior I’d ever seen. From what I could make out under a thick coating of dirt, there were wood floors where there should have been carpet—a dining room with a sloping table and three crippled chairs took the place of my kitchen—and a sitting room with one tattered sofa occupied the space where my recliner and TV should have been. 

Every surface was topped with such a thick layer of dust that the only distinguishable color was gray. And the most confusing part was that directly in front of me, straight-away from the front door itself, was a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor. 

But I lived in a one-story home. 

I moved backwards one step and surveyed the exterior of the house just to make absolutely sure that I hadn’t somehow blacked out and found my way to the wrong abode, but there were the numbers of my address on the letterbox right next to the door. 

As I had the night before, I blinked again and again in the hopes that my living room would return, but the decrepit image beyond the entry remained unchanged—there were the stairs leading up to the floor that could not exist. 

Fear began to eat its way through my liquid courage, and I reflected back on the glass from the night before. Maybe it hadn’t been a dream…maybe I’d been drugged…maybe it was part of a government experiment of some kind with LSD. There needed to be a sane explanation for what I was seeing as it was impossible that my door had randomly decided to open itself into another home. 

I went to take another step back, as my instinct then was to take off running, but before I could, a hand shot out from behind the door. 

A hand the size of my chest. 

A hand with haphazard, jagged spines jutting from the back of it. 

Pointed fingers as long as my forearms wrapped themselves around my wrist, and I was pulled inside the dismal foyer before being violently thrown to the ground near the foot of the steps. 

I felt my elbow shatter as it slammed into the floor and I heard the door crash shut behind me. Screaming in pain and terror, I turned now to face what had just ripped me into a nightmare only to find my concept of a nightmare had been childishly underestimated. 

A naked, pale creature towered over me. 

Moving on all fours, it circled me like a predator considering its next meal. And, given the daggerlike, carnivorous teeth it displayed in a mouth that opened wide enough to consume my whole head in one bite, I believed it would not be too long before I discovered what it felt like to be prey. 

Its face was rounded—containing slits for nostrils and sunken, black holes where there should have been eyes, but even lacking those, I knew it could see me—it met my gaze no matter what angle I watched it from. If not for the shape of the head and the humanoid hands, it would have appeared much like a twelve foot long, hairless dog but for one additional feature.  

The spines. 

I’d seen them on the back of the hand that grabbed me, but now that my eyes were adjusting to the light, and I’d blinked away many of the tears that had formed from the pain in my arm—I could see clearly that there were four-to-five-inch spikes sticking out from its flesh on nearly every part of its body sans its face, palms, and soles. 

Hundreds of them. 

There was no pattern or organization, and when they caught the light from the sun streaming through a window, I took them to be made of bone. On top of the talonlike fingers and the razor teeth, I then pondered that the spines on this thing might be venomous, and I started to cry once more thinking through the horrible, painful ways in which I was about to die. 

It moved closer to me, and I braced myself for the inevitable, but then, it simply stepped over my body, and climbed the stairs behind me. I heard it make the hallway above, its steps receding further and further into the house, and then a door slam. 

And I was alone. 

Gingerly, I got up from the floor, and backed myself towards the door, never taking my eyes off the stairs in case that thing came charging back down them. I felt behind me for the wall, and eventually made contact with it—blindly running my hands along its surface, I searched for the doorknob, but continued to feel nothing but smooth wood. 

Getting nowhere, I risked a look behind me to find the door so I could make my escape, but was met with yet another shock. 

It had vanished. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Staring at a bare wall between two windows, my brain broke momentarily and I began laughing. Laughing hysterically at what, I wasn’t sure, but I knew one thing.

It wasn’t real. 

It couldn’t be real. 

It was a joke of some kind—it had to be. I turned around expecting people to pop out from behind the moldy sofa, but no one came. I pulled my cellphone from my pocket to see if I had any messages from friends saying they, “got me” to find that it wouldn’t turn on, though it’d had a full charge when I’d walked out of my house just minutes earlier. 

Surveying the room around me further, I saw only candles and oil lamps for lighting—no outlets or appliances. 

I wondered if I’d somehow stepped outside of time.

With the dire nature of my situation setting in more and more by the minute, I again felt panic building in my chest. Sprinting to one of the windows that flanked where the door should have been, I peered outside to see if I could flag down someone from the street to help me, but my street was not outside those windows. 

I don’t know what I’d expected—I’d been pulled into a home not my own, and could then see that the world outside was not the one I’d left behind either. The world outside didn’t even appear to be in the same season as the one I’d come from. 

Thick snow blanketed the ground in a sea of trees that stretched further than my eye could discern. Somehow, I’d traveled from summertime in suburbia to a winter forest in an instant. What little buzz I’d had going before leaving my house that morning was fading rapidly and I was not going to be able to contain my terror much longer. 

Feeling that fleeing on foot through the woods would be better than exploring any deeper into the house and possibly running into even more terrible creatures, I tried to pry open the window I was looking out of, but it wouldn’t move. I searched for a lock that might be holding it shut, or nails, or screws, anything that would prevent it from letting me out, but there was nothing that I could locate. 

Throwing all caution away, I started to punch and kick the window following my body’s instinctual desire to run, but it seemed nothing I did could crack the glass. Overtaken by dread, I forgot even the fear that the monster I’d already met would come soon to devour me and yelled for someone, anyone to help me while I smashed my body into the panes. Eventually, I even tried to throw a chair though it, and it did nothing more than break the chair into pieces. 

And it was when I did this that I heard a voice behind me curse in a thick, French accent. 

“Motherfucker, it took me weeks to mend that last time!” It snapped. 

I shouted and jumped back against the wall after finding a waif of a man behind me. Dressed in the remains of what had possibly been business attire at one time, he’d previously had mustache, but now above his lip were a few tufts of unkempt mange. And much of the gray, matted hair on his head looked to have been yanked out. His teeth were rotting and his skin browed with dirt, but not enough to cover the needle marks in both of his arms. 

A junkie. 

“Where am I?! What do you want??” I blurted at the man, who threw a finger in front of his mouth and shushed me threateningly. 

“I want you to shut the fuck up and quit breaking shit…

“It doesn’t like it when we fight.” He whispered, ominously—eyes darting to the second floor.

I dropped my voice lower. 

“Who are you? What is it? What is this place?” I asked. 

“I,” he indicated himself, “am Henri Laurent. 

“This,” he gestured to the room around him, “is The Winter House. 

“And it…” he pointed up the stairs where the creature had disappeared, “…is The House. And The House is it.” 

He was speaking nonsense—clearly high on whatever he’d shot into his veins. My face must have shown my distaste for his bullshit when I was clearly in distress, as he smiled and continued. 

“You think I’m fucked up and spouting gibberish at you, no?” He gave a quiet chuckle, “I thought the same thing when Bo explained it to me, but he tried to… gently… deliver the news. I feel it’s easiest for you to hear the blunt truth. You’ll come to accept it more quickly that way.” 

“Accept what?” I inquired. 

“That you are dead.” He said, nonchalantly. 

“I’m dead?!” I snapped, involuntarily. 

“Not quite yet, exactly. But you will never leave here alive. Think of this place as a sort of… purgatory… A miserable purgatory…” He trailed off. 

“Please,” I pleaded with him. “I just want to go home—can you help me get out of here?”

“Were you not listening?” He quipped. “You cannot leave! No one leaves The House once it has them! It brought you here to feed on you—and there is only one way it will let you go.” 

“Stop…” I begged him. It was too much—my whole body was shaking, and I was struggling to breathe. “Please, I don’t want to hear anymore. I just want to go home.” I sniffled with tears returning to my eyes. 

“Oh, but you are home.” He said, unsympathetically. “There’s already a room prepared for you upstairs.”

“This isn’t my home!” I shouted. 

“Of course it is—you accepted the invitation.” He gave a yellow-toothed smile. 

“Invitation?” I racked my brain for a memory of accepting an invite to live with a monster and a junkie Frenchman when it hit me. 

The glass. 

The drink…

“You remember now, no?” He pestered. “What was it? Pills? Cocaine?”

“A whiskey…” I stammered. 

“Ah, yes—alcoholic then. Mine was heroin—the best I’d ever had—three needles full. The shit here is terrible, but it’s all there is…” His expression dropped to one of deepest longing. 

“There’s heroin here?” I was astonished. 

“Heroin, alcohol, pills, meth, cocaine—whatever brought you here will be here for you, always.” He paused momentarily.

“The House provides.” He finished, then walked towards the shattered chair and picked up some of the pieces. There was a pile in the corner of the room with the remains of several other pieces of furniture, and it appeared he was going to try and mend the chair using pieces of different chairs and still more pieces of chairs as tools. 

“You’ll see.” He started up again. “Go check your room—up the stairs and first door on the right—there will be something waiting for you in there that I’m sure you’re beginning to get desperate for.”

“Upstairs? Are you crazy? That thing is upstairs!” I had every intention of keeping as much space between me and the monster until I could figure out what was going on. 

“Oh, it won’t bother you now.” He said, “It was only down here to let you in—it’ll stay in its room until it’s time to feed again or unless we try to fight each other.” 

He could see that I did not trust him at his word. 

“Fine,” he sighed, “would you like me to show you to your room?” 

I did not want Henri to show me anywhere—I wanted to wake up. I tried to slap myself several times, but only found Henri’s laughing face staring back at me each time that I did. 

“Follow me.” He made a motion behind him and walked towards the stairs. “Come—there is something in your room that will make this easier.” 

I saw no reasonable alternatives. I could continue to try and smash unbreakable windows and find an invisible door, or I could follow Henri to “my” room (being I was unwilling to explore any of the rest of The House alone). So, trepidatiously, I accompanied him. 

Henri showed me up to the second floor, which comprised a single hallway that led straight back to a door at the end with three others branching off on the sides. 

“The Warden lives down there.” He pointed to the door at the end of the hall, “I’m in here,” he threw a thumb towards the first door on the left, “Bo’s in there,” he jabbed a finger to the second door on the left, “and that leaves you in here.” 

We stopped in front of the only door on the righthand side of the hall. 

I opened my mouth to ask him more questions, including why he’d referred to the creature as “The Warden,” but he shushed me for a second time. 

“Just go in and get your head right—I’ll explain how it all works, well at least what’s been passed to me and the little I understand of it, once you’ve taken the edge off a bit.” He gave an encouraging nod towards the door, and I opened it to see a small, and rather shabby room. 

My initial reaction was that it had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I was unsure what Henri was referring to as something that would help inside. A small cot one might generously call a bed sat under a window on the righthand side with a mirror facing it from the opposite wall. On the left, there was a putrid looking toilet, and the only other furniture was a small nightstand which was barren except for…

A glass of whiskey. 

The adrenaline had been masking it, but now that my body no longer felt it was in imminent threat of death, the withdrawal symptoms were encroaching and the pain in my elbow was peaking. I don’t recall entering the room or walking to the edge of the bed—all I know is one second I was at the entry with Henri, and the next I was holding the glass in my hand. 

Hesitating, and remembering the many warnings I’d been given during my life to not accept strange food or drinks, I turned back towards the door expecting Henri to be there providing affirmation that it was okay to take a sip, but he’d gone. Instead, I was startled by the touch of another hand on the one that was holding the drink. 

A gentle hand. 

Sherry’s hand. 

My body was frozen by its presence other than the arm she was guiding—she pushed it towards my mouth and from behind me, she cooed when it reached my lips, “It’s okay baby—you need this.”

So, I drank. 

It was a pale imitation of the quality of ‘The Invitation’—warm and with a flavor more reminiscent of top shelf booze than the transcendent experience I’d had the previous night. However, in that moment, it was everything that I craved. My body relaxed the instant the liquid touched my tongue, and while the powerful ecstasy did not return either, the calming effect was exquisite—even the pain in my elbow receded. Though the high was muted from what I knew was possible, it was still enough for me to beg for more.

And my wish was granted. 

I stood, rooted in place, while Sherry’s hands nudged me through two more helpings. And, while I considered that it could have just been due to my intoxication level increasing, I couldn’t help but notice each glassful tasted less potent. 

When I set the glass down the third time, Sherry left me. 

“No… No, no—come back!” I yelled. 

But she did not return. 

Alone again, Henri’s words floated through the alcoholic haze. 

“The House provides.”

Looking down at the table, the glass was yet again full, and the meaning of that statement sank into my mind. This was not a rehab or recovery home, nor would it kill me outright. It would give me a chance to feel my wife’s touch again—hear her voice—see her smile. And it would furnish me with as much poison as I could drink.

“It brought you here to feed on you.”

But it would also take from me. Sherry was not there to show me love, and she would not stay to bring me joy—she was part of The House. I reflected then on Henri’s sallow features and wondered what he might have looked like when he first arrived—contemplating who might be handing him the needles in his suite.

“You will never leave here alive.” 

I was going to die there.

I was going to die there…

Surveying the room threatening to be my tomb, I caught then something carved into the walls. 

Names. 

Hundreds of names. 

Hundreds of meals. 

A shaking hand darted for the glass again and I slammed more relief into my stomach—pushing the doom as far from my thoughts as I could.

It took seven more doses before I stopped sobbing, replacing horror with exhaustion.

What’s going with releases? Where on earth is Welcoming Committee Frankie and After Ghoul Activities? They were leaked centuries ago and yet still nothing. 

I did comment this so I’m just gonna copy myself: “WC Frankie, from what I can remember, was one of their most anticipated dolls, being similar to Coffee Break Frankie, a lot of people’s favourite Frankie.” 

From what I can remember, Frankie was meant to be a Target exclusive but they dropped them? And I know the Hissfits had a lot of trouble releasing because stores aren’t thrilled about the amount of shelf space 2-3 packs take up. That’s part of the reason (I think) Skulltimate Secrets has lowered its roster from 5 to 4 to 3, because there’s only so much space for large hunks of plastic.",3,1731809914.0,MonsterHigh,2,0.71,False
1gt3c85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gt3c85,Holiday Treats from DTD,"Went to Downtown Disney with my family to look at holiday decorations and try some treats. I highly recommend spending time in the lobby at the Grand Californian with a cozy drink and admiring the beautiful Christmas cookies. Here is my little haul!

Top left, clockwise:

Sweet Potato Loaf Cake from the treat cart at GCH
8/10 tastes like a banana-less banana bread. Cake is on the dry side, but the abundant silky frosting balances the texture. Spice is on the minimal side (very good for me) and the pecans on top are yummy. The cake flavor is pretty neutral whole the frosting has a more intense sweet cream cheese flavor. Very tasty. Needs to be eaten with a dark coffee!

Plain Caramel Apple from Marceline's 10/10 always. Where and how does Disney find the crunchiest and juiciest green apples on earth?! They are perfect.

Sleeve of Chocolate Chip Cookies from Cathy's Cookies truck 10/10 Served fresh and warm and in a big quantity. These are so yummy and the perfect texture, a little crisp and a little chewy. You can only buy a lot of these at a time but they are still really good the next day if you don't finish them.

Classuc Churro from California Churro Company 9.9/10 fresh and perfectly cooked, almost as good as an in-park Churro

Hot Cocoa Cookie from GCH treat cart 9/10 it seems very pricey but it is huge like a Crumbl cookie. It tastes like it was made with very high quality ingredients. It's extremely chocolatey and stuffed with a creamy filling, sort of like Oreo creme. The chocolate ganache on top is very decadent. It's rich enough (and big enough) that just one of these bad boys could be a shareable dessert for a whole family.
