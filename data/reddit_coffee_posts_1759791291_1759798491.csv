1o00qxd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o00qxd,AIO or Do we think my best friend was inlove with me ?,"So I met him in 2016. I was a freshman in high school and he was a senior. We spoke here and there . But we didn‚Äôt hang out till I was 16 and he was already in college . But it was just exploring the city and eating the whole summer of 2018 . We became best friends . We had such an amazing friendship. One day he said that I shouldn‚Äôt get back with my ex because he likes me. I brushed it off and got back with my ex . But distance myself . But then me and my ex broke up and I started chatting with my friend again and it was again an amazing friendship . We were always together and living life. I have never shown romance interest. But the thing is neither did he physically at least. But then he came to my house one day with my favorite coffee and confessed again. And I was like okay let‚Äôs talk about this a different time and I blocked him thinking the feelings would go away. Then, I unblocked him because we really did have a good friendship . He was in a relationship at that time so I didn‚Äôt do too much . Just left him unblocked . Then, I got in a relationship. My friend would hit me up here and there and say stuff that made me think he could have liked me but not directly ?? So I didn‚Äôt want to assume because at this point he was with his partner for a year and I was happy in my relationship. So I just started leaving him on read . But then he came back into my life and at this point we are both into our relationship 3 years in. I am happy in my relationship but I moved to a different state with my boyfriend and had no friends here. Then, one day my friend hit me up out of the blue even though we don‚Äôt follow each other . And I asked my boyfriend if he is okay with me chatting with my friend and my bf was perfect fine with it . He said as long as there is no funny business . ( I did let my boyfriend check the messages if he wanted too). The conversation was fine and normal.  My friend followed me and I followed him. We started chatting almost everyday for like a month. But then he started comparing his girlfriend to me and ofc I told him to stop doing that and that it‚Äôs not right . Etc. Then, he stopped . Then, he started comparing how similar me and him are . Which is like okay I do like the same things as him. And I was starting to question if I should stop chatting with him. My dad told me I could be over reacting it‚Äôs just a friendship . So I was like whatever. Then, I posted a countdown of me going back to my hometown and he was begging to see me . And I was okay with texting but I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable hanging out with him in person out of respect for my bf and his gf. And then I kept making excuses that I‚Äôm busy . Then he was like I need to catch up with you. And I told him that he can just catch up with me through text. And he was like it‚Äôs things I can‚Äôt say through here . So that‚Äôs when my brain was like am I being dramatic rn or is he able to tell me that he still likes me even though we weren‚Äôt in contact for about 2 years at this point. So I tell him definitely not and he can just tell me through text. ( the screenshots will say what he said next ).  After that I decided I need to cut contact with him forever . Mind you he has been with his girlfriend for 3 years at this point and lives with her . To me in the moment that message sounded like he was either confessing that he is inlove with me or he really misses me as a friend . I was confused and still am. Like when my boyfriend saw it he was like hell no . But when my dad saw it he was like it just sounds like a friend that misses you , you‚Äôre so dramatic. I did end up blocking him and it‚Äôs been like 3-4 weeks . What to me that sounded like a confession but idk if I read too deep into it . Let me know what you guys think .

1o00q3f,https://i.redd.it/worte3we7ltf1.jpeg,The Framing or: The Conundrum of the Singing Heads,"Derrick comes back from the daily meeting with coffee in a styrofoam cup balanced on top of a folder marked ‚ÄúThird Quarter Staff Feedback Report‚Äù. The coffee, filled with a mix of brown sugar and powdered vanilla creamer, is what will make or break his mood for the day. It *will* break. But he‚Äôll forget the drink he‚Äôd carried ten stories to his cubicle as quickly as that important thing you‚Äôve been meaning to do when you get home but, gosh darn it, you‚Äôve had a long day and need to relax a bit before you get any work done.



The folder and the coffee go on his desk. He pulls out his cheap office chair with the squeaky hinges and prepares to sit and rot away the day.



On his monitor, or rather *in* his monitor, a group of neckless heads bounce and sing. Frayed lips in front of yellowed and rotten teeth sing and dance (as much as a head can by bouncing and wiggling its ears), but Derrick can‚Äôt hear what they‚Äôre singing.



Derrick blinks.



The heads are still there, bouncing, shaking their ears, and singing without sound.

  


Derrick sits in his chair, rubs his eyes, slaps himself twice across the face, and looks back to the monitor.



The heads haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. One of the heads on the top row is bleeding onto the heads below. None of them notice or care. No matter where Derrick looks at them from (and he climbs all over his office in a stupor to check) the heads sit in his screen like it's a huge box that *isn‚Äôt* the flat quarter-inch depth screen he‚Äôs been using for years now. From all angles it stands like it always has, that being with a slight leaning that Derrick‚Äôs never been able to fix. But the screen itself is quite deep - deep enough to house almost half a dozen heads.



No matter how many times he blinks, rubs his eyes, pinches his thighs, or splashes water onto his face in the bathroom, the heads remain in his screen. When he finally gives up trying to *not* notice them, his eyelids hurt, the skin around them red and swollen, and his body is covered in pinch bruises that look like long mosquito bites. Sitting in his cubicle, away from his monitor of course, Derrick decides there‚Äôs only two things to do about his situation.



‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he says.



The first thing done, he fishes a bag out of the bottom bin of his filing cabinet. Derrick may be a wage slave, but he has his own ways of toeing the line (the words below the line reading ‚Äúconfirmation of termination, please initial here‚Äù). At the back of the bin sits his last resort: a bottle of a special syrup to make his insides go out. He puts a little on his tongue and washes it down with one of the White Claws that he also keeps in the emergency drawer. He‚Äôs not sure if the alcohol will have time to kick in, but something to make life feel just a bit less real is worth the risk.



While he waits for the special syrup to pull the emergency evacuation button in his stomach, Derrick taps his foot against the floor and stares into the garbage can. At the edges of his hearing, he thinks he can hear the heads singing. It might be his imagination, he *prays* it's his imagination, but he might also be starting to feel a certain rhythmic bumping from behind him.



Bouncing and singing‚Ä¶



The smell of blood and rotten meat‚Ä¶



Rhythm that conveyed what the heads would like to do to Derrick.

¬†

If only he‚Äôd come poke his own head into the hole‚Ä¶



Two pieces of toast, some butter, half a gallon of coffee, and a protein bar come out of his mouth with the consistency of a thin milkshake and paint his garbage can with a mustard yellow. The salaryman‚Äôs body tenses and seizes; he *hates* throwing up more than anything, but recovers and runs to the HR department.



‚ÄúRachel,‚Äù Derrick says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home, there‚Äôs puke in the trash bag in my cubicle for proof, could you write my slip out for me?‚Äù



‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rachel says. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to put as the reason for leaving?‚Äù



*Throwing up?*



Not specific enough. A good cover is vital if you‚Äôre going to skip work, especially on a Monday morning. Maybe-



‚ÄúMister Anderson?‚Äù



A broad and stocky elephant with a bad wig and bags of fat rolling off of her dress creeps around the corner of HR‚Äôs group of cubicles. She, Pauline, calls Derrick ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù with a thick Agent Smith accent that‚Äôs been, to her at least, the funniest fucking thing on the planet after first reading his last name off at his company orientation. Which proves that elephants *are* as smart as everyone claims they are.



‚ÄúMister Anderson, you‚Äôve missed too much work this month already, I‚Äôm afraid-‚Äù



Right beside Derrick‚Äôs least favorite circus freak, he notices Rachel‚Äôs monitor. Long, red fingers perch on the edge from the inside. Thick red liquid pours down the frame and onto the keyboard. A man with big green teeth and a wide smile looks at Derrick and winks a glassy and scratched eye. He tries to say something, but no words leave his mouth when he moves his lips, though plenty of phlegm sprays out onto Pauline‚Äôs keyboard.



‚ÄúPauline?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mister Anderson? It‚Äôs a bit rude to inter-‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you see that?‚Äù



Pauline turns to look at the monitor. Her well-maintained HR smile cracks a bit as she tries to discern what Mister Anderson could be talking about.



‚ÄúNo, Mister Anderson, whatever it is you‚Äôre pointing at, I can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù



The red man in the screen smiles wider, cupping his hands and shouting something that Derrick can‚Äôt hear. Not yet, at least. Like with the heads in his office, he‚Äôs starting to hear what the thing is trying so hard to tell him. One of the man‚Äôs eyes rolls out its socket and lands in the glass of water Pauline has on her desk. It doesn‚Äôt make a splash, or even affect the water at all.



*That‚Äôs it then,* Derrick thinks. *I‚Äôm going insane.*



So he leaves. Without another word to HR or anyone else in the office, he walks out of the building, starts up his truck, and drives home. Some time later, when Rachel and Pauline hear of his death, they‚Äôll take the explanation of ‚Äúspontaneous aneurysm‚Äù without any doubt. Neither of the women had ever seen a man look as pale and clammy as Derrick had the day he left the office.



Pauline will go on to say that her and ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù were good friends, and even make an attempt to speak at his funeral.



\-



Being a salary-man with a bachelor‚Äôs degree working for his company for nearly a decade, Derrick was lucky to be able to afford sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other bachelors in their early thirties. One was a crew leader at McDonald‚Äôs, the other a lead at the local Amazon Warehouse.



Mac, the McCrew leader, thinks Derrick was doing some kind of ‚Äúbit‚Äù when told about the heads in the computer monitors. Ammy, the warehouse worker, believes it.



The two stare in disbelief at a mirror set up in the corner of Derrick‚Äôs room. Blood covers his hand but the others can‚Äôt see it. They can feel it, even smell it when he holds a finger under their nose fart-smell style, but all they seem to be certain of is the background on Derrick‚Äôs PC: a very large breasted cartoon office worker encouraging any viewers to ‚Äútake a load off.‚Äù



What Derrick sees is a hand with no fingers, blood oozing from the holes where fingers should be. The arm, with no body in sight, is flailing around the inner dimensions of the monitor. Blood spills from the screen and onto the keyboard below.



‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt see anything!?‚Äù Derrick asks after insisting the group go back to the living room.



‚ÄúNo, dude!‚Äù Says Mac. ‚ÄúBut *fuck* man, I can still smell the blood!‚Äù



‚ÄúSame,‚Äù says Ammy.



‚ÄúWe should toss it, here, I can-‚Äù



‚Äú*No!*‚Äù Derrick shouts, jumping in front of his door ‚Äúwe can figure this out, right!? That shit cost a hundred dollars!‚Äù



They nod, even if they don‚Äôt look excited about it.



After thirty minutes of investigating, ten of which spent fussing with the ruler on Derrick‚Äôs phone in lieu of a physical ruler anywhere in the apartment, the roommates are able to establish some rules:



* Only Derrick can see whatever appears inside. The other two can feel something cold on their fingers when they touch the screen or move the blood, and can smell it when they get up close. Nothing moves the blood no matter how hard they try. It doesn‚Äôt burn either, as the three find out after calming themselves with blunts and deciding to try anything that comes to mind.
* The creatures and blood disappear when Derrick leaves the immediate area. An exact measurement is researched, but the boys are much too high to come up with anything over a vague ‚Äútwenty steps away.‚Äù



Mac puts the monitor in the farthest corner of his room on the other side of the apartment after the three take a break to eat half of the food in the fridge. They rally in the living room, theorize, cry over the seriousness of both Derrick‚Äôs situation and the disparate state of their lives, before capping off the night by half-watching comedic edits of daytime TV on YouTube.



Derrick goes to bed exhausted but not wanting to sleep. Mac and Ammy try to encourage him by saying that it‚Äôll be easier to figure out and deal with after some sleep. This turns out to be true. He does figure it out, and that‚Äôs what kills him.



\-

  


The answer arrives in a dream after some hours spent lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling.



What was it about computer monitors specifically? Was it something he‚Äôd said, or did? Is there some sort of mechanism to all this, something that only his brain can conceive? Maybe some curse? Despite feeling clever for being able to think of these possibilities, nothing comes of it. All that he can think to think of when he dozes off is the last time he‚Äôd been looking at a computer screen before this morning.



It was last night, after what he called (never out loud) one of his ‚Äúgame and goon‚Äù sessions. Something about the busty office lady on his desktop had entranced him that night in particular. In some universe, in some insane circumstances, she could walk out of the monitor, couldn‚Äôt she? If people could bring something as abstract as programs to a semblance of life, what was stopping the cute office worker from physically emerging and declaring her love for him?



Derrick knew these thoughts were insane, childish, and stupid. He thought them anyway. The fantasy itself was fun and any distraction from his life was a welcome one.



This has nothing to do with the curse Derrick brought upon himself, except for one specific thought he‚Äôd had before passing out in his chair with pajama bottoms still wrapped around his ankles: A wish and a prayer that *something* could come out of the confines of his expensive piece of machinery to make his life interesting.



*Anything.*



In his dreams, both nights, his monitor appears disassembled into odd shapes. The shapes shudder before moving into place; the dimensions of it locking into place with a *snap.* The cute office girl appears inside, her smile red with blood.



The second night he has this dream, he realizes a mechanism behind the curse, and it has to do with that one word:



*Frame.*



The concept of a frame. The way word and idea click together in a burst of synapses. He woke up in a freezing sweat that first night but had forgotten what the nightmare had been after realizing that he was late for work. The blood and pus had been there, but it had gone unnoticed. He isn‚Äôt so lucky now. He‚Äôs remembered the dream this time, and this one was longer than the first.¬†



Along with the frames of the screen, there were four iron bars with wheels on each end.



The iron bars rotate in the dark void of the dream. A mattress appears. So do bedsheets that look a lot like his. The bed comes together with a *click* as the frame locks into place*.* Derrick sees himself below the covers. Arms are reaching for him from under the bed.



His eyes shoot open. Moon and streetlight filter through the blinds on his window and cast cold blue bars around his room. Derrick wishes, *begs,* with the fibers of faith he still has left that he could have stayed asleep forever.



The light from the blinds is illuminating silhouettes around his bed. Some things, or some ones, are climbing over the edge of his mattress. All he can make out are their glassy eyes and rotten teeth.



Hands clamp down over his shoulders and mouth, pinning him to the bed. An iron-like and salty mix of fluids pour into his mouth. His screams mix with it and come out as bubbles between rotten and bony fingers.



‚Äú*Thank you.‚Äù*



The words coming from moving lips don‚Äôt reach Derrick‚Äôs ears, but he can hear their echoes in his head.



	‚Äú*Thank you‚Ä¶‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúTHANK YOU!‚Äù*



A chorus of gravelly whispers floods his mind while wet hands start to caress his body, the things around him staring at his skin like it was the sweetest, tastiest looking thing they‚Äôd ever seen. The thing restraining Derrick leans in even closer towards his face, its tongue snaking out and reaching for Derrick‚Äôs eyeball.



Derrick jolts, his upper body jumping upwards as his hands claw his mattress. The hands on his shoulders and mouth tighten their grip. He pushes again, focusing the force into his shoulders while rocking his head upwards and catching the chin of the thing trying to lick him. The *CLACK* of its rotten teeth slamming together and severing a tongue is like a gunshot in the silence of the room and gives Derrick another jolt to his senses, enough to put one last shove into the things pinning him down. He wrestles himself free and throws his body over the side of the bed towards the bedroom door. He lands awkwardly, crushing something under his back.



Hot liquid soaks his shirt and paints his back. Something opens and closes against his shoulder blades; it must be teeth because what else could be sliding out of a tight squeeze to try and get at his skin?



The scream that had been waiting so long to escape finally explodes in a bloody mess out of Derrick‚Äôs mouth while he kicks his hands and feet against the ground, pushing himself away from his bed and towards his closet. A second scream, this one much more shrill, goes out when his back finally hits the wall, but he can‚Äôt help himself. He can‚Äôt look away from his bed. The zombies or ghouls or demons or whatever-the-hell are pouring out of his bedframe. At least a dozen are ripping and pulling at each other trying to get to Derrick first.



The mattress is pushed upwards and stands beside the bed, making the scene resemble creatures bursting out of a haunted chest. From beyond the frame itself come screams and cries of pain and pleasure that Derrick can only hear in his head. It‚Äôs so loud it feels like something is trying to break through his skull.



His pathetic kicks against the carpet finally gain some traction. Pushing himself against the wall, standing, then finally running to the bedroom door and pushing it open hard enough to make a doorknob-shaped hole in the apartment hallway.



Mac and Ammy are awake and standing outside of their rooms wearing only boxers and t-shirts. Both had been rubbing their eyes and thinking ‚Äú*what the fuck happened I thought the monitor was far enough away to be safe.‚Äù*¬†



Derrick doesn‚Äôt even notice them. He doesn‚Äôt stop running until he‚Äôs busted out of the apartment‚Äôs front door and into the hallway of their apartment building. Exhaustion hits him with a gut punch as he slides back against the wall and sits on the floor gasping for breath.



To his roommates, he only appears pale and sweaty. Neither see the blood and mucus, but Derrick doesn‚Äôt care. His eyes are on the hallway leading to his room. He can hardly see it as the only light in the apartment is from an overhead oven lamp. Derrick doesn‚Äôt dare look away to even answer his and Ammy‚Äôs questions and doesn‚Äôt dare to blink. For all he knows, he‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôs caught off guard again. Or worse.



‚ÄúWhat happened!?‚Äù Ammy whispers.



Both he and Mac join Derrick in staring back into their apartment, even if they know they can‚Äôt see anything.



‚Äú*MY BEDFRAME!‚Äù*



Derrick, having forgotten where he is, screams the words even louder than he‚Äôd screamed for his life. Mac‚Äôs palm quiets him down with a hard *slap* to his mouth that also serves to help focus his roommate.



‚ÄúMy bedframe,‚Äù Derrick whispers. ‚ÄúThey came from my bedframe!‚Äù



Ammy and Mac double check that none of their neighbors have come to cuss the three out. They haven‚Äôt. Closed doorways line the halls, and no heads poke out to check for the commotion. Luckily the residents on this floor are drug addicts that are too tired or too used to their own noise to care.



Derrick squirms against the wall, eyes still on the corner that rounds to his room. He knows that one of the things will come around it. Any time now. Yet, he‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it; His hands are wringing his pajama bottoms so hard that his knuckles blanch. But he‚Äôs okay. Even if they come around the corner, they‚Äôre still far enough away from the doorframe-



*CLICK*



The door into their apartment is gone. In its place is a door into a horrible burning place. A pile of red flesh tries to surge through the doorway but is quickly jammed into the tight hole in less than a second. Yet even more terrifying are the sounds behind them.



A melody and a beat. Both accented with meaningless shouts that do their best to be lyrics to a song that cannot have any. A song of agony that leaves little room for words; Except for a name. They call for Derrick. Threaten, plead, bargain, all while they reach as hard as they can with whatever limb will fit through the gaps in their squeezed form.



In some spot of the cacophony, one word is clear:



*Inevitable.*



It rings in Derrick‚Äôs head as he wrestles out and away from Ammy and Mac‚Äôs grip on him to get away from the new opening. The two look shocked only long enough for the ghouls spilling out of the door to climb around them. Some take useless bites at the exposed flesh, breaking their teeth and cracking their jawbones. For the two roommates, all they feel is a cold several times more severe than what they‚Äôd felt from Derrick‚Äôs monitor. They want to call after Derrick as he runs down the wall, but what if the cold flows into their mouths or their bodies?



Doors are opening left and right in front and behind Derrick as he runs. Bodies pile out of each, so brittle yet so hungry that they twitch and buckle as they try to chase their prey. It‚Äôs impossible to keep track of them all. His sanity drops with the room numbers until he finally makes it to the end of the hall. He‚Äôs been running for the stairwell, but bodies are already falling out of it when he‚Äôs only thirty feet away.



The area of effect, the bubble of whatever his curse was, was growing.



The elevator opens as soon as he thumbs the button with an arrow pointing downwards, earning a squeaky but victorious cheer from Derrick as he jumps inside and hammers the ‚Äúdoor close‚Äù button. He presses it so hard that he nearly breaks his thumb. Sadly, the elevator being available is the last victory he‚Äôll get. No doubt he wouldn‚Äôt have celebrated if he knew he‚Äôd only delayed his inevitable and bloody end by a few hours.



The elevator stops suddenly, throwing Derrick‚Äôs stomach into his throat. He stumbles out into his complex‚Äôs pathetic excuse for a parking lot, where garbage and thieves spend pleasant evenings sharing gnarled potholes and cracked cement with the local feral cats. For his own feet‚Äôs sake he slows from a run to a brisk walk. Thorns and broken glass dig into his foot but that‚Äôs a phantom pain far removed from the image of the things chasing him.



He stops at the border between the lot and a wildlife conservation park that conserves nothing but a homeless camp. His truck is here, and he clambers over the tailgate, the entire frame shaking-



*CLICK*



A few of the homeless in the nearby park wake up in a daze from the sound of a man screaming and running through the woods about his truck trying to kill him.



\-



One of the few instances of a truce between fentanyl-addicted, insane homeless people and those who wear badged-blue button-ups with guts that spill over their belts: Death.



Death is a fantastic mediary, especially the morning after Derrick first noticed the heads in his computer.



Officer Vasquez and Julie Buckham, both persons new to their respective fields of law enforcement and homelessness, walk to the middle of the now-evacuated tent town in the park.



‚ÄúReggie brought him to the fire,‚Äù says Julie. ‚ÄúHe was screaming, losing his fucking gourd about things coming to kill him and how he was ‚Äòdead fucking meat‚Äô and tons of other shit. I knew he was on acid, probably white too, when I first saw him. Son of a bitch needed to calm down before his heart exploded. Isn‚Äôt that ironic?‚Äù



Vasquez nods and concentrates on keeping his legs from shaking as they approach the body of the poor bastard. One of the homeless had had a phone. Vasquez, being a ‚ÄúFucking New Guy‚Äù to most of the force, had to handle the call. The phone operators had dismissed it as the delusions of the local ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù. None of them believed it, and Vasquez thought he didn‚Äôt, but the description they‚Äôd given him had still freaked him out:



A man‚Äôs head had spontaneously exploded.



His legs shake a little as he and Julie pass the last line of tents before hitting the center of the homeless camp. The body is there, laying against a hollow oil barrel. Blood was everywhere, radiating outwards all around the body, whose face and neck had survived the explosion. His skull had not.



Two things about the carnage immediately stand out to Vasquez, both of which he‚Äôd later recount in pop myth conspiracy books and local conventions he‚Äôll be asked to attend:



* The man‚Äôs parietal bone, the part of the skull that starts at the very top of your head and ends at the bend towards the back, had exploded in a bloody bomb. But *only* that section. The forehead, face, and upper neck were completely unaffected. His last living act, to make a tortured and anguished scream, was still frozen on his face.
* The pool of blood both in front of and *behind* the corpse. There was far, *far* more than a single person could hold. It even circled the oil drum in a way the blood couldn‚Äôt have landed from the shape of the exploded skull. Bare footprints are dotted throughout the blood, even though the homeless all wore slippers and shoes. Vasques had seen them for himself. They‚Äôd all run a mile away and wouldn‚Äôt take a single step back the way they‚Äôd come. Vasquez didn‚Äôt blame them.

	

‚ÄúWho ran through here?‚Äù Vasquez asked. It wasn‚Äôt the first verb that ran through his mind though, that was ‚Äúdance.‚Äù There was an odd pattern to all of the footsteps that reminded Vasquez of footprint covered dance tutorial sheets.



‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúWe all bugged the hell out. I watched this place the entire time while I waited for the cops to get here, and nobody touched the place after he‚Ä¶ He‚Ä¶‚Äù



Julie recounts for the third time that morning how she‚Äôd brought the screaming man to the fire barrel. Someone had been after him, but he‚Äôd refused to explain who. He‚Äôd been certain that his life was over. Julie sat with him and shared some of her food and listened to him talk, mostly repeating disparate scenes from the previous two days.



‚ÄúBy -*hic-* by the end, he‚Äôd actually started to calm down a bit. He even seemed hopeful, like he could figure out whatever the situation in was, and then I said something and he fucking *DIED!‚Äù*



Julie moves away from the body and squeezes her throat to keep what little she‚Äôs had this morning from coming up her throat.

For some (needed) backstory, my boyfriend and I have been together since the seventh grade. In the beginning, yes there were some ups and downs some on and off. There was a point in time he made us friends with benefits, but mostly one sided. I had done it back to him just to get my revenge essentially. which worked because he felt how I had felt for the past couple of months and stopped, in return I stopped. Fast-forward like five or six years. we now live together and have two cats together. My boyfriend hates me being on his phone (to this day) and seems to be nervous anytime I‚Äôm on his phone as if I‚Äôm going to find something (which is triggering for me considering our past issues.) He‚Äôs also secretive about his finances, but is always curious about mine. It‚Äôs just certain things that I can do, but he can‚Äôt that bother me. One morning I decided to go through his phone. I had a dream two different times that night of him being unfaithful and to reassure myself I decided to just go through the phone in hopes to find nothing. Instead, I found old pictures on Snapchat from when that whole friends with benefits thing was happening. Seeing that truly made me feel disgusted. It brought up old feelings. It made me very irritated with him for the rest of the day. I didn‚Äôt say goodbye when I left for work, I didn‚Äôt talk to him all day and I went to his sister‚Äòs house before I went home. She helped me gather my words and all the things i needed, wanted to say n do. He knew something was up the second I left for work with no goodbye. When i came home we talked about the pictures i found. He openly offered to delete Snapchat and deactivate his account. When he did that, I felt it was only fair if I did too, which he didn‚Äôt understand, but idc. His sister and i created a list of different things that I wanted to go through on his phone, found pretty much nothing until I went through passwords. (She‚Äôs a mega mind genius for that suggestion) going through his passwords I found an only fans account that was last used in 2020. He didn‚Äôt have the app, of course, but his personal email and personal password that he uses for everything was used for this only fans account. So to me that made it loud and clear it was for nothing other than his own use. I had clicked on it to see what it took me to. I asked him ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this??‚Äù and he said he didn‚Äôt even know that existed. I don‚Äôt know why, but I ignorantly brushed it off. I guess the shock stopped me from thinking clearly and reacting properly. I just deleted the password and moved on to the next thing to look through. We had talked some more about other things and how things gotta change for us to be solid n happy. A little while later we went to go get Chick-fil-A. On the way home from getting Chick-fil-A I was thinking about it and how he used his personal stuff to make the account so it was clearly for him. I asked him about it AGAIN and what it was used for why it was used (given we were together at the time) he said ‚Äú I have no idea why I used it. Maybe I was just horny. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù that of course set me OFF and I looked through some chats saw that one girl was in his primary chat (please tell me how severe that is!!) and there were SOOOO many in his general, oh and two favorites. Or two ppl favorited his account? idk I couldn‚Äôt see what the favorite post was but again I don‚Äôt know anything about only fans so I don‚Äôt know what any of this really means. The account name was some fake name and the username was something I had never see him use before. I was pissed and in a panic of course so I deactivated & deleted everything. When we got home before he even put the car in park, I was getting out went inside, went to our room, laid in bed & didn‚Äôt eat dinner. Then I decided I didn‚Äôt even wanna be in the same room so I left to go take a shower and brought clothes with me so I could get dressed in the bathroom. When I came back from my shower, I snatched a pillow and a blanket and set up on the couch because I was not sleeping in bed with him. not much time went by before he sat on the coffee table in front of me and asked me ‚Äúare we not gonna talk?‚Äù to which I said ‚Äúwhat is there to talk about?‚Äú I said ‚Äúyou used an app to look at and talk to other women while actively dating me. It‚Äôs not like you were on porn hub where no one knows who you are. This is legit like a dating app or social media app for sex.‚Äù he over and over and over again tried to say he never talked to anyone ever and then I asked ‚Äúoh so what was it just like a explore page?‚Äù I mentioned the girl in his primary chat and asked why is she separated from the other chats if you didn‚Äôt talk to anyone he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know how it works. I only used it once or twice.‚Äù to which I said if it‚Äôs anything like Instagram, you have to either one engage with so-and-so or move them to a primary chat so it‚Äôs easier to find. I argued some more about how none of the girls profile pictures resemblance me at all. I‚Äôm short brunette, and from what I saw none of them were. At the time (in 2020) I also was going through surgeries/recovery (hip reconstruction to be exact) because of arthritis. So I said to him, ‚Äúwas it because I was away for a week that was too long for you ? Or is it because I was pale and too skinny. Or is it the scars? What about me wasn‚Äôt enough? What about me wasn‚Äôt attractive for you?‚Äù he expressed over and over again that that would never be the case, and that he was never in his life ever unattracted to me and that none of that had anything to do with it. Again, he said he doesn‚Äôt know he was just being stupid and he regrets it . The back-and-forth of the questioning and the answer being I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm sorry for the most part happened for a while. eventually, the conversation came to a point where I was done, crying and done asking questions and getting nowhere I said to him ‚ÄúI really appreciate the fact of you owning this and taking action to let me go through your phone and delete things and you offered to delete things yada yada. This maturity shows me that I can‚Äôt punish you for something you did when you were 16. This is still a dealbreaker for me, which you would never know if I never told you. God forbid this ever happens again it‚Äôs over.‚Äù before I even finished the last part of that sentence he said 1 million times ‚Äúnever it‚Äôll never happen again never ever!‚Äù I ended up sleeping in bed instead of the couch. It‚Äôs been I think two days since this conversation happened and he‚Äôs still hesitant with certain things like cuddling or hugging. He‚Äôs being distant with me almost like to play it safe. I want things to be normal but i don‚Äôt feel normal. I also don‚Äôt want to be an asshole and treat him differently for something that happened six years ago for, something that wouldn‚Äôt happen today. If anyone has gone through something similar or knows enough about only fans and can tell me what the right move is I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Sorry for being so goddamn long lol.

1o00p2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o00p2r/the_framing_or_the_conundrum_of_the_singing_heads/,The Framing or: The Conundrum of the Singing Heads,"Derrick comes back from the daily meeting with coffee in a styrofoam cup balanced on top of a folder marked ‚ÄúThird Quarter Staff Feedback Report‚Äù. The coffee, filled with a mix of brown sugar and powdered vanilla creamer, is what will make or break his mood for the day. It *will* break. But he‚Äôll forget the drink he‚Äôd carried ten stories to his cubicle as quickly as that important thing you‚Äôve been meaning to do when you get home but, gosh darn it, you‚Äôve had a long day and need to relax a bit before you get any work done.



The folder and the coffee go on his desk. He pulls out his cheap office chair with the squeaky hinges and prepares to sit and rot away the day.



On his monitor, or rather *in* his monitor, a group of neckless heads bounce and sing. Frayed lips in front of yellowed and rotten teeth sing and dance (as much as a head can by bouncing and wiggling its ears), but Derrick can‚Äôt hear what they‚Äôre singing.



Derrick blinks.



The heads are still there, bouncing, shaking their ears, and singing without sound.

  


Derrick sits in his chair, rubs his eyes, slaps himself twice across the face, and looks back to the monitor.



The heads haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. One of the heads on the top row is bleeding onto the heads below. None of them notice or care. No matter where Derrick looks at them from (and he climbs all over his office in a stupor to check) the heads sit in his screen like it's a huge box that *isn‚Äôt* the flat quarter-inch depth screen he‚Äôs been using for years now. From all angles it stands like it always has, that being with a slight leaning that Derrick‚Äôs never been able to fix. But the screen itself is quite deep - deep enough to house almost half a dozen heads.



No matter how many times he blinks, rubs his eyes, pinches his thighs, or splashes water onto his face in the bathroom, the heads remain in his screen. When he finally gives up trying to *not* notice them, his eyelids hurt, the skin around them red and swollen, and his body is covered in pinch bruises that look like long mosquito bites. Sitting in his cubicle, away from his monitor of course, Derrick decides there‚Äôs only two things to do about his situation.



‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he says.



The first thing done, he fishes a bag out of the bottom bin of his filing cabinet. Derrick may be a wage slave, but he has his own ways of toeing the line (the words below the line reading ‚Äúconfirmation of termination, please initial here‚Äù). At the back of the bin sits his last resort: a bottle of a special syrup to make his insides go out. He puts a little on his tongue and washes it down with one of the White Claws that he also keeps in the emergency drawer. He‚Äôs not sure if the alcohol will have time to kick in, but something to make life feel just a bit less real is worth the risk.



While he waits for the special syrup to pull the emergency evacuation button in his stomach, Derrick taps his foot against the floor and stares into the garbage can. At the edges of his hearing, he thinks he can hear the heads singing. It might be his imagination, he *prays* it's his imagination, but he might also be starting to feel a certain rhythmic bumping from behind him.



Bouncing and singing‚Ä¶



The smell of blood and rotten meat‚Ä¶



Rhythm that conveyed what the heads would like to do to Derrick.

¬†

If only he‚Äôd come poke his own head into the hole‚Ä¶



Two pieces of toast, some butter, half a gallon of coffee, and a protein bar come out of his mouth with the consistency of a thin milkshake and paint his garbage can with a mustard yellow. The salaryman‚Äôs body tenses and seizes; he *hates* throwing up more than anything, but recovers and runs to the HR department.



‚ÄúRachel,‚Äù Derrick says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home, there‚Äôs puke in the trash bag in my cubicle for proof, could you write my slip out for me?‚Äù



‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rachel says. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to put as the reason for leaving?‚Äù



*Throwing up?*



Not specific enough. A good cover is vital if you‚Äôre going to skip work, especially on a Monday morning. Maybe-



‚ÄúMister Anderson?‚Äù



A broad and stocky elephant with a bad wig and bags of fat rolling off of her dress creeps around the corner of HR‚Äôs group of cubicles. She, Pauline, calls Derrick ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù with a thick Agent Smith accent that‚Äôs been, to her at least, the funniest fucking thing on the planet after first reading his last name off at his company orientation. Which proves that elephants *are* as smart as everyone claims they are.



‚ÄúMister Anderson, you‚Äôve missed too much work this month already, I‚Äôm afraid-‚Äù



Right beside Derrick‚Äôs least favorite circus freak, he notices Rachel‚Äôs monitor. Long, red fingers perch on the edge from the inside. Thick red liquid pours down the frame and onto the keyboard. A man with big green teeth and a wide smile looks at Derrick and winks a glassy and scratched eye. He tries to say something, but no words leave his mouth when he moves his lips, though plenty of phlegm sprays out onto Pauline‚Äôs keyboard.



‚ÄúPauline?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mister Anderson? It‚Äôs a bit rude to inter-‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you see that?‚Äù



Pauline turns to look at the monitor. Her well-maintained HR smile cracks a bit as she tries to discern what Mister Anderson could be talking about.



‚ÄúNo, Mister Anderson, whatever it is you‚Äôre pointing at, I can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù



The red man in the screen smiles wider, cupping his hands and shouting something that Derrick can‚Äôt hear. Not yet, at least. Like with the heads in his office, he‚Äôs starting to hear what the thing is trying so hard to tell him. One of the man‚Äôs eyes rolls out its socket and lands in the glass of water Pauline has on her desk. It doesn‚Äôt make a splash, or even affect the water at all.



*That‚Äôs it then,* Derrick thinks. *I‚Äôm going insane.*



So he leaves. Without another word to HR or anyone else in the office, he walks out of the building, starts up his truck, and drives home. Some time later, when Rachel and Pauline hear of his death, they‚Äôll take the explanation of ‚Äúspontaneous aneurysm‚Äù without any doubt. Neither of the women had ever seen a man look as pale and clammy as Derrick had the day he left the office.



Pauline will go on to say that her and ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù were good friends, and even make an attempt to speak at his funeral.



\-



Being a salary-man with a bachelor‚Äôs degree working for his company for nearly a decade, Derrick was lucky to be able to afford sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other bachelors in their early thirties. One was a crew leader at McDonald‚Äôs, the other a lead at the local Amazon Warehouse.



Mac, the McCrew leader, thinks Derrick was doing some kind of ‚Äúbit‚Äù when told about the heads in the computer monitors. Ammy, the warehouse worker, believes it.



The two stare in disbelief at a mirror set up in the corner of Derrick‚Äôs room. Blood covers his hand but the others can‚Äôt see it. They can feel it, even smell it when he holds a finger under their nose fart-smell style, but all they seem to be certain of is the background on Derrick‚Äôs PC: a very large breasted cartoon office worker encouraging any viewers to ‚Äútake a load off.‚Äù



What Derrick sees is a hand with no fingers, blood oozing from the holes where fingers should be. The arm, with no body in sight, is flailing around the inner dimensions of the monitor. Blood spills from the screen and onto the keyboard below.



‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt see anything!?‚Äù Derrick asks after insisting the group go back to the living room.



‚ÄúNo, dude!‚Äù Says Mac. ‚ÄúBut *fuck* man, I can still smell the blood!‚Äù



‚ÄúSame,‚Äù says Ammy.



‚ÄúWe should toss it, here, I can-‚Äù



‚Äú*No!*‚Äù Derrick shouts, jumping in front of his door ‚Äúwe can figure this out, right!? That shit cost a hundred dollars!‚Äù



They nod, even if they don‚Äôt look excited about it.



After thirty minutes of investigating, ten of which spent fussing with the ruler on Derrick‚Äôs phone in lieu of a physical ruler anywhere in the apartment, the roommates are able to establish some rules:



* Only Derrick can see whatever appears inside. The other two can feel something cold on their fingers when they touch the screen or move the blood, and can smell it when they get up close. Nothing moves the blood no matter how hard they try. It doesn‚Äôt burn either, as the three find out after calming themselves with blunts and deciding to try anything that comes to mind.
* The creatures and blood disappear when Derrick leaves the immediate area. An exact measurement is researched, but the boys are much too high to come up with anything over a vague ‚Äútwenty steps away.‚Äù



Mac puts the monitor in the farthest corner of his room on the other side of the apartment after the three take a break to eat half of the food in the fridge. They rally in the living room, theorize, cry over the seriousness of both Derrick‚Äôs situation and the disparate state of their lives, before capping off the night by half-watching comedic edits of daytime TV on YouTube.



Derrick goes to bed exhausted but not wanting to sleep. Mac and Ammy try to encourage him by saying that it‚Äôll be easier to figure out and deal with after some sleep. This turns out to be true. He does figure it out, and that‚Äôs what kills him.



\-

  


The answer arrives in a dream after some hours spent lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling.



What was it about computer monitors specifically? Was it something he‚Äôd said, or did? Is there some sort of mechanism to all this, something that only his brain can conceive? Maybe some curse? Despite feeling clever for being able to think of these possibilities, nothing comes of it. All that he can think to think of when he dozes off is the last time he‚Äôd been looking at a computer screen before this morning.



It was last night, after what he called (never out loud) one of his ‚Äúgame and goon‚Äù sessions. Something about the busty office lady on his desktop had entranced him that night in particular. In some universe, in some insane circumstances, she could walk out of the monitor, couldn‚Äôt she? If people could bring something as abstract as programs to a semblance of life, what was stopping the cute office worker from physically emerging and declaring her love for him?



Derrick knew these thoughts were insane, childish, and stupid. He thought them anyway. The fantasy itself was fun and any distraction from his life was a welcome one.



This has nothing to do with the curse Derrick brought upon himself, except for one specific thought he‚Äôd had before passing out in his chair with pajama bottoms still wrapped around his ankles: A wish and a prayer that *something* could come out of the confines of his expensive piece of machinery to make his life interesting.



*Anything.*



In his dreams, both nights, his monitor appears disassembled into odd shapes. The shapes shudder before moving into place; the dimensions of it locking into place with a *snap.* The cute office girl appears inside, her smile red with blood.



The second night he has this dream, he realizes a mechanism behind the curse, and it has to do with that one word:



*Frame.*



The concept of a frame. The way word and idea click together in a burst of synapses. He woke up in a freezing sweat that first night but had forgotten what the nightmare had been after realizing that he was late for work. The blood and pus had been there, but it had gone unnoticed. He isn‚Äôt so lucky now. He‚Äôs remembered the dream this time, and this one was longer than the first.¬†



Along with the frames of the screen, there were four iron bars with wheels on each end.



The iron bars rotate in the dark void of the dream. A mattress appears. So do bedsheets that look a lot like his. The bed comes together with a *click* as the frame locks into place*.* Derrick sees himself below the covers. Arms are reaching for him from under the bed.



His eyes shoot open. Moon and streetlight filter through the blinds on his window and cast cold blue bars around his room. Derrick wishes, *begs,* with the fibers of faith he still has left that he could have stayed asleep forever.



The light from the blinds is illuminating silhouettes around his bed. Some things, or some ones, are climbing over the edge of his mattress. All he can make out are their glassy eyes and rotten teeth.



Hands clamp down over his shoulders and mouth, pinning him to the bed. An iron-like and salty mix of fluids pour into his mouth. His screams mix with it and come out as bubbles between rotten and bony fingers.



‚Äú*Thank you.‚Äù*



The words coming from moving lips don‚Äôt reach Derrick‚Äôs ears, but he can hear their echoes in his head.



	‚Äú*Thank you‚Ä¶‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúTHANK YOU!‚Äù*



A chorus of gravelly whispers floods his mind while wet hands start to caress his body, the things around him staring at his skin like it was the sweetest, tastiest looking thing they‚Äôd ever seen. The thing restraining Derrick leans in even closer towards his face, its tongue snaking out and reaching for Derrick‚Äôs eyeball.



Derrick jolts, his upper body jumping upwards as his hands claw his mattress. The hands on his shoulders and mouth tighten their grip. He pushes again, focusing the force into his shoulders while rocking his head upwards and catching the chin of the thing trying to lick him. The *CLACK* of its rotten teeth slamming together and severing a tongue is like a gunshot in the silence of the room and gives Derrick another jolt to his senses, enough to put one last shove into the things pinning him down. He wrestles himself free and throws his body over the side of the bed towards the bedroom door. He lands awkwardly, crushing something under his back.



Hot liquid soaks his shirt and paints his back. Something opens and closes against his shoulder blades; it must be teeth because what else could be sliding out of a tight squeeze to try and get at his skin?



The scream that had been waiting so long to escape finally explodes in a bloody mess out of Derrick‚Äôs mouth while he kicks his hands and feet against the ground, pushing himself away from his bed and towards his closet. A second scream, this one much more shrill, goes out when his back finally hits the wall, but he can‚Äôt help himself. He can‚Äôt look away from his bed. The zombies or ghouls or demons or whatever-the-hell are pouring out of his bedframe. At least a dozen are ripping and pulling at each other trying to get to Derrick first.



The mattress is pushed upwards and stands beside the bed, making the scene resemble creatures bursting out of a haunted chest. From beyond the frame itself come screams and cries of pain and pleasure that Derrick can only hear in his head. It‚Äôs so loud it feels like something is trying to break through his skull.



His pathetic kicks against the carpet finally gain some traction. Pushing himself against the wall, standing, then finally running to the bedroom door and pushing it open hard enough to make a doorknob-shaped hole in the apartment hallway.



Mac and Ammy are awake and standing outside of their rooms wearing only boxers and t-shirts. Both had been rubbing their eyes and thinking ‚Äú*what the fuck happened I thought the monitor was far enough away to be safe.‚Äù*¬†



Derrick doesn‚Äôt even notice them. He doesn‚Äôt stop running until he‚Äôs busted out of the apartment‚Äôs front door and into the hallway of their apartment building. Exhaustion hits him with a gut punch as he slides back against the wall and sits on the floor gasping for breath.



To his roommates, he only appears pale and sweaty. Neither see the blood and mucus, but Derrick doesn‚Äôt care. His eyes are on the hallway leading to his room. He can hardly see it as the only light in the apartment is from an overhead oven lamp. Derrick doesn‚Äôt dare look away to even answer his and Ammy‚Äôs questions and doesn‚Äôt dare to blink. For all he knows, he‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôs caught off guard again. Or worse.



‚ÄúWhat happened!?‚Äù Ammy whispers.



Both he and Mac join Derrick in staring back into their apartment, even if they know they can‚Äôt see anything.



‚Äú*MY BEDFRAME!‚Äù*



Derrick, having forgotten where he is, screams the words even louder than he‚Äôd screamed for his life. Mac‚Äôs palm quiets him down with a hard *slap* to his mouth that also serves to help focus his roommate.



‚ÄúMy bedframe,‚Äù Derrick whispers. ‚ÄúThey came from my bedframe!‚Äù



Ammy and Mac double check that none of their neighbors have come to cuss the three out. They haven‚Äôt. Closed doorways line the halls, and no heads poke out to check for the commotion. Luckily the residents on this floor are drug addicts that are too tired or too used to their own noise to care.



Derrick squirms against the wall, eyes still on the corner that rounds to his room. He knows that one of the things will come around it. Any time now. Yet, he‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it; His hands are wringing his pajama bottoms so hard that his knuckles blanch. But he‚Äôs okay. Even if they come around the corner, they‚Äôre still far enough away from the doorframe-



*CLICK*



The door into their apartment is gone. In its place is a door into a horrible burning place. A pile of red flesh tries to surge through the doorway but is quickly jammed into the tight hole in less than a second. Yet even more terrifying are the sounds behind them.



A melody and a beat. Both accented with meaningless shouts that do their best to be lyrics to a song that cannot have any. A song of agony that leaves little room for words; Except for a name. They call for Derrick. Threaten, plead, bargain, all while they reach as hard as they can with whatever limb will fit through the gaps in their squeezed form.



In some spot of the cacophony, one word is clear:



*Inevitable.*



It rings in Derrick‚Äôs head as he wrestles out and away from Ammy and Mac‚Äôs grip on him to get away from the new opening. The two look shocked only long enough for the ghouls spilling out of the door to climb around them. Some take useless bites at the exposed flesh, breaking their teeth and cracking their jawbones. For the two roommates, all they feel is a cold several times more severe than what they‚Äôd felt from Derrick‚Äôs monitor. They want to call after Derrick as he runs down the wall, but what if the cold flows into their mouths or their bodies?



Doors are opening left and right in front and behind Derrick as he runs. Bodies pile out of each, so brittle yet so hungry that they twitch and buckle as they try to chase their prey. It‚Äôs impossible to keep track of them all. His sanity drops with the room numbers until he finally makes it to the end of the hall. He‚Äôs been running for the stairwell, but bodies are already falling out of it when he‚Äôs only thirty feet away.



The area of effect, the bubble of whatever his curse was, was growing.



The elevator opens as soon as he thumbs the button with an arrow pointing downwards, earning a squeaky but victorious cheer from Derrick as he jumps inside and hammers the ‚Äúdoor close‚Äù button. He presses it so hard that he nearly breaks his thumb. Sadly, the elevator being available is the last victory he‚Äôll get. No doubt he wouldn‚Äôt have celebrated if he knew he‚Äôd only delayed his inevitable and bloody end by a few hours.



The elevator stops suddenly, throwing Derrick‚Äôs stomach into his throat. He stumbles out into his complex‚Äôs pathetic excuse for a parking lot, where garbage and thieves spend pleasant evenings sharing gnarled potholes and cracked cement with the local feral cats. For his own feet‚Äôs sake he slows from a run to a brisk walk. Thorns and broken glass dig into his foot but that‚Äôs a phantom pain far removed from the image of the things chasing him.



He stops at the border between the lot and a wildlife conservation park that conserves nothing but a homeless camp. His truck is here, and he clambers over the tailgate, the entire frame shaking-



*CLICK*



A few of the homeless in the nearby park wake up in a daze from the sound of a man screaming and running through the woods about his truck trying to kill him.



\-



One of the few instances of a truce between fentanyl-addicted, insane homeless people and those who wear badged-blue button-ups with guts that spill over their belts: Death.



Death is a fantastic mediary, especially the morning after Derrick first noticed the heads in his computer.



Officer Vasquez and Julie Buckham, both persons new to their respective fields of law enforcement and homelessness, walk to the middle of the now-evacuated tent town in the park.



‚ÄúReggie brought him to the fire,‚Äù says Julie. ‚ÄúHe was screaming, losing his fucking gourd about things coming to kill him and how he was ‚Äòdead fucking meat‚Äô and tons of other shit. I knew he was on acid, probably white too, when I first saw him. Son of a bitch needed to calm down before his heart exploded. Isn‚Äôt that ironic?‚Äù



Vasquez nods and concentrates on keeping his legs from shaking as they approach the body of the poor bastard. One of the homeless had had a phone. Vasquez, being a ‚ÄúFucking New Guy‚Äù to most of the force, had to handle the call. The phone operators had dismissed it as the delusions of the local ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù. None of them believed it, and Vasquez thought he didn‚Äôt, but the description they‚Äôd given him had still freaked him out:



A man‚Äôs head had spontaneously exploded.



His legs shake a little as he and Julie pass the last line of tents before hitting the center of the homeless camp. The body is there, laying against a hollow oil barrel. Blood was everywhere, radiating outwards all around the body, whose face and neck had survived the explosion. His skull had not.



Two things about the carnage immediately stand out to Vasquez, both of which he‚Äôd later recount in pop myth conspiracy books and local conventions he‚Äôll be asked to attend:



* The man‚Äôs parietal bone, the part of the skull that starts at the very top of your head and ends at the bend towards the back, had exploded in a bloody bomb. But *only* that section. The forehead, face, and upper neck were completely unaffected. His last living act, to make a tortured and anguished scream, was still frozen on his face.
* The pool of blood both in front of and *behind* the corpse. There was far, *far* more than a single person could hold. It even circled the oil drum in a way the blood couldn‚Äôt have landed from the shape of the exploded skull. Bare footprints are dotted throughout the blood, even though the homeless all wore slippers and shoes. Vasques had seen them for himself. They‚Äôd all run a mile away and wouldn‚Äôt take a single step back the way they‚Äôd come. Vasquez didn‚Äôt blame them.

	

‚ÄúWho ran through here?‚Äù Vasquez asked. It wasn‚Äôt the first verb that ran through his mind though, that was ‚Äúdance.‚Äù There was an odd pattern to all of the footsteps that reminded Vasquez of footprint covered dance tutorial sheets.



‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúWe all bugged the hell out. I watched this place the entire time while I waited for the cops to get here, and nobody touched the place after he‚Ä¶ He‚Ä¶‚Äù



Julie recounts for the third time that morning how she‚Äôd brought the screaming man to the fire barrel. Someone had been after him, but he‚Äôd refused to explain who. He‚Äôd been certain that his life was over. Julie sat with him and shared some of her food and listened to him talk, mostly repeating disparate scenes from the previous two days.

The coffee, filled with a mix of brown sugar and powdered vanilla creamer, is what will make or break his mood for the day. It *will* break. But he‚Äôll forget the drink he‚Äôd carried ten stories to his cubicle as quickly as that important thing you‚Äôve been meaning to do when you get home but, gosh darn it, you‚Äôve had a long day and need to relax a bit before you get any work done.



The folder and the coffee go on his desk. He pulls out his cheap office chair with the squeaky hinges and prepares to sit and rot away the day.



On his monitor, or rather *in* his monitor, a group of neckless heads bounce and sing. Frayed lips in front of yellowed and rotten teeth sing and dance (as much as a head can by bouncing and wiggling its ears), but Derrick can‚Äôt hear what they‚Äôre singing.



Derrick blinks.



The heads are still there, bouncing, shaking their ears, and singing without sound.

  


Derrick sits in his chair, rubs his eyes, slaps himself twice across the face, and looks back to the monitor.



The heads haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. One of the heads on the top row is bleeding onto the heads below. None of them notice or care. No matter where Derrick looks at them from (and he climbs all over his office in a stupor to check) the heads sit in his screen like it's a huge box that *isn‚Äôt* the flat quarter-inch depth screen he‚Äôs been using for years now. From all angles it stands like it always has, that being with a slight leaning that Derrick‚Äôs never been able to fix. But the screen itself is quite deep - deep enough to house almost half a dozen heads.



No matter how many times he blinks, rubs his eyes, pinches his thighs, or splashes water onto his face in the bathroom, the heads remain in his screen. When he finally gives up trying to *not* notice them, his eyelids hurt, the skin around them red and swollen, and his body is covered in pinch bruises that look like long mosquito bites. Sitting in his cubicle, away from his monitor of course, Derrick decides there‚Äôs only two things to do about his situation.



‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he says.



The first thing done, he fishes a bag out of the bottom bin of his filing cabinet. Derrick may be a wage slave, but he has his own ways of toeing the line (the words below the line reading ‚Äúconfirmation of termination, please initial here‚Äù). At the back of the bin sits his last resort: a bottle of a special syrup to make his insides go out. He puts a little on his tongue and washes it down with one of the White Claws that he also keeps in the emergency drawer. He‚Äôs not sure if the alcohol will have time to kick in, but something to make life feel just a bit less real is worth the risk.



While he waits for the special syrup to pull the emergency evacuation button in his stomach, Derrick taps his foot against the floor and stares into the garbage can. At the edges of his hearing, he thinks he can hear the heads singing. It might be his imagination, he *prays* it's his imagination, but he might also be starting to feel a certain rhythmic bumping from behind him.



Bouncing and singing‚Ä¶



The smell of blood and rotten meat‚Ä¶



Rhythm that conveyed what the heads would like to do to Derrick.

¬†

If only he‚Äôd come poke his own head into the hole‚Ä¶



Two pieces of toast, some butter, half a gallon of coffee, and a protein bar come out of his mouth with the consistency of a thin milkshake and paint his garbage can with a mustard yellow. The salaryman‚Äôs body tenses and seizes; he *hates* throwing up more than anything, but recovers and runs to the HR department.



‚ÄúRachel,‚Äù Derrick says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home, there‚Äôs puke in the trash bag in my cubicle for proof, could you write my slip out for me?‚Äù



‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rachel says. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to put as the reason for leaving?‚Äù



*Throwing up?*



Not specific enough. A good cover is vital if you‚Äôre going to skip work, especially on a Monday morning. Maybe-



‚ÄúMister Anderson?‚Äù



A broad and stocky elephant with a bad wig and bags of fat rolling off of her dress creeps around the corner of HR‚Äôs group of cubicles. She, Pauline, calls Derrick ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù with a thick Agent Smith accent that‚Äôs been, to her at least, the funniest fucking thing on the planet after first reading his last name off at his company orientation. Which proves that elephants *are* as smart as everyone claims they are.



‚ÄúMister Anderson, you‚Äôve missed too much work this month already, I‚Äôm afraid-‚Äù



Right beside Derrick‚Äôs least favorite circus freak, he notices Rachel‚Äôs monitor. Long, red fingers perch on the edge from the inside. Thick red liquid pours down the frame and onto the keyboard. A man with big green teeth and a wide smile looks at Derrick and winks a glassy and scratched eye. He tries to say something, but no words leave his mouth when he moves his lips, though plenty of phlegm sprays out onto Pauline‚Äôs keyboard.



‚ÄúPauline?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mister Anderson? It‚Äôs a bit rude to inter-‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you see that?‚Äù



Pauline turns to look at the monitor. Her well-maintained HR smile cracks a bit as she tries to discern what Mister Anderson could be talking about.



‚ÄúNo, Mister Anderson, whatever it is you‚Äôre pointing at, I can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù



The red man in the screen smiles wider, cupping his hands and shouting something that Derrick can‚Äôt hear. Not yet, at least. Like with the heads in his office, he‚Äôs starting to hear what the thing is trying so hard to tell him. One of the man‚Äôs eyes rolls out its socket and lands in the glass of water Pauline has on her desk. It doesn‚Äôt make a splash, or even affect the water at all.



*That‚Äôs it then,* Derrick thinks. *I‚Äôm going insane.*



So he leaves. Without another word to HR or anyone else in the office, he walks out of the building, starts up his truck, and drives home. Some time later, when Rachel and Pauline hear of his death, they‚Äôll take the explanation of ‚Äúspontaneous aneurysm‚Äù without any doubt. Neither of the women had ever seen a man look as pale and clammy as Derrick had the day he left the office.



Pauline will go on to say that her and ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù were good friends, and even make an attempt to speak at his funeral.



\-



Being a salary-man with a bachelor‚Äôs degree working for his company for nearly a decade, Derrick was lucky to be able to afford sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other bachelors in their early thirties. One was a crew leader at McDonald‚Äôs, the other a lead at the local Amazon Warehouse.



Mac, the McCrew leader, thinks Derrick was doing some kind of ‚Äúbit‚Äù when told about the heads in the computer monitors. Ammy, the warehouse worker, believes it.



The two stare in disbelief at a mirror set up in the corner of Derrick‚Äôs room. Blood covers his hand but the others can‚Äôt see it. They can feel it, even smell it when he holds a finger under their nose fart-smell style, but all they seem to be certain of is the background on Derrick‚Äôs PC: a very large breasted cartoon office worker encouraging any viewers to ‚Äútake a load off.‚Äù



What Derrick sees is a hand with no fingers, blood oozing from the holes where fingers should be. The arm, with no body in sight, is flailing around the inner dimensions of the monitor. Blood spills from the screen and onto the keyboard below.



‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt see anything!?‚Äù Derrick asks after insisting the group go back to the living room.



‚ÄúNo, dude!‚Äù Says Mac. ‚ÄúBut *fuck* man, I can still smell the blood!‚Äù



‚ÄúSame,‚Äù says Ammy.



‚ÄúWe should toss it, here, I can-‚Äù



‚Äú*No!*‚Äù Derrick shouts, jumping in front of his door ‚Äúwe can figure this out, right!? That shit cost a hundred dollars!‚Äù



They nod, even if they don‚Äôt look excited about it.



After thirty minutes of investigating, ten of which spent fussing with the ruler on Derrick‚Äôs phone in lieu of a physical ruler anywhere in the apartment, the roommates are able to establish some rules:



* Only Derrick can see whatever appears inside. The other two can feel something cold on their fingers when they touch the screen or move the blood, and can smell it when they get up close. Nothing moves the blood no matter how hard they try. It doesn‚Äôt burn either, as the three find out after calming themselves with blunts and deciding to try anything that comes to mind.
* The creatures and blood disappear when Derrick leaves the immediate area. An exact measurement is researched, but the boys are much too high to come up with anything over a vague ‚Äútwenty steps away.‚Äù



Mac puts the monitor in the farthest corner of his room on the other side of the apartment after the three take a break to eat half of the food in the fridge. They rally in the living room, theorize, cry over the seriousness of both Derrick‚Äôs situation and the disparate state of their lives, before capping off the night by half-watching comedic edits of daytime TV on YouTube.



Derrick goes to bed exhausted but not wanting to sleep. Mac and Ammy try to encourage him by saying that it‚Äôll be easier to figure out and deal with after some sleep. This turns out to be true. He does figure it out, and that‚Äôs what kills him.



\-

  


The answer arrives in a dream after some hours spent lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling.



What was it about computer monitors specifically? Was it something he‚Äôd said, or did? Is there some sort of mechanism to all this, something that only his brain can conceive? Maybe some curse? Despite feeling clever for being able to think of these possibilities, nothing comes of it. All that he can think to think of when he dozes off is the last time he‚Äôd been looking at a computer screen before this morning.



It was last night, after what he called (never out loud) one of his ‚Äúgame and goon‚Äù sessions. Something about the busty office lady on his desktop had entranced him that night in particular. In some universe, in some insane circumstances, she could walk out of the monitor, couldn‚Äôt she? If people could bring something as abstract as programs to a semblance of life, what was stopping the cute office worker from physically emerging and declaring her love for him?



Derrick knew these thoughts were insane, childish, and stupid. He thought them anyway. The fantasy itself was fun and any distraction from his life was a welcome one.



This has nothing to do with the curse Derrick brought upon himself, except for one specific thought he‚Äôd had before passing out in his chair with pajama bottoms still wrapped around his ankles: A wish and a prayer that *something* could come out of the confines of his expensive piece of machinery to make his life interesting.



*Anything.*



In his dreams, both nights, his monitor appears disassembled into odd shapes. The shapes shudder before moving into place; the dimensions of it locking into place with a *snap.* The cute office girl appears inside, her smile red with blood.



The second night he has this dream, he realizes a mechanism behind the curse, and it has to do with that one word:



*Frame.*



The concept of a frame. The way word and idea click together in a burst of synapses. He woke up in a freezing sweat that first night but had forgotten what the nightmare had been after realizing that he was late for work. The blood and pus had been there, but it had gone unnoticed. He isn‚Äôt so lucky now. He‚Äôs remembered the dream this time, and this one was longer than the first.¬†



Along with the frames of the screen, there were four iron bars with wheels on each end.



The iron bars rotate in the dark void of the dream. A mattress appears. So do bedsheets that look a lot like his. The bed comes together with a *click* as the frame locks into place*.* Derrick sees himself below the covers. Arms are reaching for him from under the bed.



His eyes shoot open. Moon and streetlight filter through the blinds on his window and cast cold blue bars around his room. Derrick wishes, *begs,* with the fibers of faith he still has left that he could have stayed asleep forever.



The light from the blinds is illuminating silhouettes around his bed. Some things, or some ones, are climbing over the edge of his mattress. All he can make out are their glassy eyes and rotten teeth.



Hands clamp down over his shoulders and mouth, pinning him to the bed. An iron-like and salty mix of fluids pour into his mouth. His screams mix with it and come out as bubbles between rotten and bony fingers.



‚Äú*Thank you.‚Äù*



The words coming from moving lips don‚Äôt reach Derrick‚Äôs ears, but he can hear their echoes in his head.



	‚Äú*Thank you‚Ä¶‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúTHANK YOU!‚Äù*



A chorus of gravelly whispers floods his mind while wet hands start to caress his body, the things around him staring at his skin like it was the sweetest, tastiest looking thing they‚Äôd ever seen. The thing restraining Derrick leans in even closer towards his face, its tongue snaking out and reaching for Derrick‚Äôs eyeball.



Derrick jolts, his upper body jumping upwards as his hands claw his mattress. The hands on his shoulders and mouth tighten their grip. He pushes again, focusing the force into his shoulders while rocking his head upwards and catching the chin of the thing trying to lick him. The *CLACK* of its rotten teeth slamming together and severing a tongue is like a gunshot in the silence of the room and gives Derrick another jolt to his senses, enough to put one last shove into the things pinning him down. He wrestles himself free and throws his body over the side of the bed towards the bedroom door. He lands awkwardly, crushing something under his back.



Hot liquid soaks his shirt and paints his back. Something opens and closes against his shoulder blades; it must be teeth because what else could be sliding out of a tight squeeze to try and get at his skin?



The scream that had been waiting so long to escape finally explodes in a bloody mess out of Derrick‚Äôs mouth while he kicks his hands and feet against the ground, pushing himself away from his bed and towards his closet. A second scream, this one much more shrill, goes out when his back finally hits the wall, but he can‚Äôt help himself. He can‚Äôt look away from his bed. The zombies or ghouls or demons or whatever-the-hell are pouring out of his bedframe. At least a dozen are ripping and pulling at each other trying to get to Derrick first.



The mattress is pushed upwards and stands beside the bed, making the scene resemble creatures bursting out of a haunted chest. From beyond the frame itself come screams and cries of pain and pleasure that Derrick can only hear in his head. It‚Äôs so loud it feels like something is trying to break through his skull.



His pathetic kicks against the carpet finally gain some traction. Pushing himself against the wall, standing, then finally running to the bedroom door and pushing it open hard enough to make a doorknob-shaped hole in the apartment hallway.



Mac and Ammy are awake and standing outside of their rooms wearing only boxers and t-shirts. Both had been rubbing their eyes and thinking ‚Äú*what the fuck happened I thought the monitor was far enough away to be safe.‚Äù*¬†



Derrick doesn‚Äôt even notice them. He doesn‚Äôt stop running until he‚Äôs busted out of the apartment‚Äôs front door and into the hallway of their apartment building. Exhaustion hits him with a gut punch as he slides back against the wall and sits on the floor gasping for breath.



To his roommates, he only appears pale and sweaty. Neither see the blood and mucus, but Derrick doesn‚Äôt care. His eyes are on the hallway leading to his room. He can hardly see it as the only light in the apartment is from an overhead oven lamp. Derrick doesn‚Äôt dare look away to even answer his and Ammy‚Äôs questions and doesn‚Äôt dare to blink. For all he knows, he‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôs caught off guard again. Or worse.



‚ÄúWhat happened!?‚Äù Ammy whispers.



Both he and Mac join Derrick in staring back into their apartment, even if they know they can‚Äôt see anything.



‚Äú*MY BEDFRAME!‚Äù*



Derrick, having forgotten where he is, screams the words even louder than he‚Äôd screamed for his life. Mac‚Äôs palm quiets him down with a hard *slap* to his mouth that also serves to help focus his roommate.



‚ÄúMy bedframe,‚Äù Derrick whispers. ‚ÄúThey came from my bedframe!‚Äù



Ammy and Mac double check that none of their neighbors have come to cuss the three out. They haven‚Äôt. Closed doorways line the halls, and no heads poke out to check for the commotion. Luckily the residents on this floor are drug addicts that are too tired or too used to their own noise to care.



Derrick squirms against the wall, eyes still on the corner that rounds to his room. He knows that one of the things will come around it. Any time now. Yet, he‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it; His hands are wringing his pajama bottoms so hard that his knuckles blanch. But he‚Äôs okay. Even if they come around the corner, they‚Äôre still far enough away from the doorframe-



*CLICK*



The door into their apartment is gone. In its place is a door into a horrible burning place. A pile of red flesh tries to surge through the doorway but is quickly jammed into the tight hole in less than a second. Yet even more terrifying are the sounds behind them.



A melody and a beat. Both accented with meaningless shouts that do their best to be lyrics to a song that cannot have any. A song of agony that leaves little room for words; Except for a name. They call for Derrick. Threaten, plead, bargain, all while they reach as hard as they can with whatever limb will fit through the gaps in their squeezed form.



In some spot of the cacophony, one word is clear:



*Inevitable.*



It rings in Derrick‚Äôs head as he wrestles out and away from Ammy and Mac‚Äôs grip on him to get away from the new opening. The two look shocked only long enough for the ghouls spilling out of the door to climb around them. Some take useless bites at the exposed flesh, breaking their teeth and cracking their jawbones. For the two roommates, all they feel is a cold several times more severe than what they‚Äôd felt from Derrick‚Äôs monitor. They want to call after Derrick as he runs down the wall, but what if the cold flows into their mouths or their bodies?



Doors are opening left and right in front and behind Derrick as he runs. Bodies pile out of each, so brittle yet so hungry that they twitch and buckle as they try to chase their prey. It‚Äôs impossible to keep track of them all. His sanity drops with the room numbers until he finally makes it to the end of the hall. He‚Äôs been running for the stairwell, but bodies are already falling out of it when he‚Äôs only thirty feet away.



The area of effect, the bubble of whatever his curse was, was growing.



The elevator opens as soon as he thumbs the button with an arrow pointing downwards, earning a squeaky but victorious cheer from Derrick as he jumps inside and hammers the ‚Äúdoor close‚Äù button. He presses it so hard that he nearly breaks his thumb. Sadly, the elevator being available is the last victory he‚Äôll get. No doubt he wouldn‚Äôt have celebrated if he knew he‚Äôd only delayed his inevitable and bloody end by a few hours.



The elevator stops suddenly, throwing Derrick‚Äôs stomach into his throat. He stumbles out into his complex‚Äôs pathetic excuse for a parking lot, where garbage and thieves spend pleasant evenings sharing gnarled potholes and cracked cement with the local feral cats. For his own feet‚Äôs sake he slows from a run to a brisk walk. Thorns and broken glass dig into his foot but that‚Äôs a phantom pain far removed from the image of the things chasing him.



He stops at the border between the lot and a wildlife conservation park that conserves nothing but a homeless camp. His truck is here, and he clambers over the tailgate, the entire frame shaking-



*CLICK*



A few of the homeless in the nearby park wake up in a daze from the sound of a man screaming and running through the woods about his truck trying to kill him.



\-



One of the few instances of a truce between fentanyl-addicted, insane homeless people and those who wear badged-blue button-ups with guts that spill over their belts: Death.



Death is a fantastic mediary, especially the morning after Derrick first noticed the heads in his computer.



Officer Vasquez and Julie Buckham, both persons new to their respective fields of law enforcement and homelessness, walk to the middle of the now-evacuated tent town in the park.



‚ÄúReggie brought him to the fire,‚Äù says Julie. ‚ÄúHe was screaming, losing his fucking gourd about things coming to kill him and how he was ‚Äòdead fucking meat‚Äô and tons of other shit. I knew he was on acid, probably white too, when I first saw him. Son of a bitch needed to calm down before his heart exploded. Isn‚Äôt that ironic?‚Äù



Vasquez nods and concentrates on keeping his legs from shaking as they approach the body of the poor bastard. One of the homeless had had a phone. Vasquez, being a ‚ÄúFucking New Guy‚Äù to most of the force, had to handle the call. The phone operators had dismissed it as the delusions of the local ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù. None of them believed it, and Vasquez thought he didn‚Äôt, but the description they‚Äôd given him had still freaked him out:



A man‚Äôs head had spontaneously exploded.



His legs shake a little as he and Julie pass the last line of tents before hitting the center of the homeless camp. The body is there, laying against a hollow oil barrel. Blood was everywhere, radiating outwards all around the body, whose face and neck had survived the explosion. His skull had not.



Two things about the carnage immediately stand out to Vasquez, both of which he‚Äôd later recount in pop myth conspiracy books and local conventions he‚Äôll be asked to attend:



* The man‚Äôs parietal bone, the part of the skull that starts at the very top of your head and ends at the bend towards the back, had exploded in a bloody bomb. But *only* that section. The forehead, face, and upper neck were completely unaffected. His last living act, to make a tortured and anguished scream, was still frozen on his face.
* The pool of blood both in front of and *behind* the corpse. There was far, *far* more than a single person could hold. It even circled the oil drum in a way the blood couldn‚Äôt have landed from the shape of the exploded skull. Bare footprints are dotted throughout the blood, even though the homeless all wore slippers and shoes. Vasques had seen them for himself. They‚Äôd all run a mile away and wouldn‚Äôt take a single step back the way they‚Äôd come. Vasquez didn‚Äôt blame them.

	

‚ÄúWho ran through here?‚Äù Vasquez asked. It wasn‚Äôt the first verb that ran through his mind though, that was ‚Äúdance.‚Äù There was an odd pattern to all of the footsteps that reminded Vasquez of footprint covered dance tutorial sheets.



‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúWe all bugged the hell out. I watched this place the entire time while I waited for the cops to get here, and nobody touched the place after he‚Ä¶ He‚Ä¶‚Äù



Julie recounts for the third time that morning how she‚Äôd brought the screaming man to the fire barrel. Someone had been after him, but he‚Äôd refused to explain who. He‚Äôd been certain that his life was over. Julie sat with him and shared some of her food and listened to him talk, mostly repeating disparate scenes from the previous two days.



‚ÄúBy -*hic-* by the end, he‚Äôd actually started to calm down a bit. He even seemed hopeful, like he could figure out whatever the situation in was, and then I said something and he fucking *DIED!‚Äù*



Julie moves away from the body and squeezes her throat to keep what little she‚Äôs had this morning from coming up her throat.



‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù Vasquez asks, his own breakfast at his throat. ‚ÄúThe last thing you said to him, I mean.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat he had a good outlook,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúThat he had a pretty good frame of mind.‚Äù

One of the man‚Äôs eyes rolls out its socket and lands in the glass of water Pauline has on her desk. It doesn‚Äôt make a splash, or even affect the water at all.



*That‚Äôs it then,* Derrick thinks. *I‚Äôm going insane.*



So he leaves. Without another word to HR or anyone else in the office, he walks out of the building, starts up his truck, and drives home. Some time later, when Rachel and Pauline hear of his death, they‚Äôll take the explanation of ‚Äúspontaneous aneurysm‚Äù without any doubt. Neither of the women had ever seen a man look as pale and clammy as Derrick had the day he left the office.



Pauline will go on to say that her and ‚ÄúMister Anderson‚Äù were good friends, and even make an attempt to speak at his funeral.



\-



Being a salary-man with a bachelor‚Äôs degree working for his company for nearly a decade, Derrick was lucky to be able to afford sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other bachelors in their early thirties. One was a crew leader at McDonald‚Äôs, the other a lead at the local Amazon Warehouse.



Mac, the McCrew leader, thinks Derrick was doing some kind of ‚Äúbit‚Äù when told about the heads in the computer monitors. Ammy, the warehouse worker, believes it.



The two stare in disbelief at a mirror set up in the corner of Derrick‚Äôs room. Blood covers his hand but the others can‚Äôt see it. They can feel it, even smell it when he holds a finger under their nose fart-smell style, but all they seem to be certain of is the background on Derrick‚Äôs PC: a very large breasted cartoon office worker encouraging any viewers to ‚Äútake a load off.‚Äù



What Derrick sees is a hand with no fingers, blood oozing from the holes where fingers should be. The arm, with no body in sight, is flailing around the inner dimensions of the monitor. Blood spills from the screen and onto the keyboard below.



‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt see anything!?‚Äù Derrick asks after insisting the group go back to the living room.



‚ÄúNo, dude!‚Äù Says Mac. ‚ÄúBut *fuck* man, I can still smell the blood!‚Äù



‚ÄúSame,‚Äù says Ammy.



‚ÄúWe should toss it, here, I can-‚Äù



‚Äú*No!*‚Äù Derrick shouts, jumping in front of his door ‚Äúwe can figure this out, right!? That shit cost a hundred dollars!‚Äù



They nod, even if they don‚Äôt look excited about it.



After thirty minutes of investigating, ten of which spent fussing with the ruler on Derrick‚Äôs phone in lieu of a physical ruler anywhere in the apartment, the roommates are able to establish some rules:



* Only Derrick can see whatever appears inside. The other two can feel something cold on their fingers when they touch the screen or move the blood, and can smell it when they get up close. Nothing moves the blood no matter how hard they try. It doesn‚Äôt burn either, as the three find out after calming themselves with blunts and deciding to try anything that comes to mind.
* The creatures and blood disappear when Derrick leaves the immediate area. An exact measurement is researched, but the boys are much too high to come up with anything over a vague ‚Äútwenty steps away.‚Äù



Mac puts the monitor in the farthest corner of his room on the other side of the apartment after the three take a break to eat half of the food in the fridge. They rally in the living room, theorize, cry over the seriousness of both Derrick‚Äôs situation and the disparate state of their lives, before capping off the night by half-watching comedic edits of daytime TV on YouTube.



Derrick goes to bed exhausted but not wanting to sleep. Mac and Ammy try to encourage him by saying that it‚Äôll be easier to figure out and deal with after some sleep. This turns out to be true. He does figure it out, and that‚Äôs what kills him.



\-

  


The answer arrives in a dream after some hours spent lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling.



What was it about computer monitors specifically? Was it something he‚Äôd said, or did? Is there some sort of mechanism to all this, something that only his brain can conceive? Maybe some curse? Despite feeling clever for being able to think of these possibilities, nothing comes of it. All that he can think to think of when he dozes off is the last time he‚Äôd been looking at a computer screen before this morning.



It was last night, after what he called (never out loud) one of his ‚Äúgame and goon‚Äù sessions. Something about the busty office lady on his desktop had entranced him that night in particular. In some universe, in some insane circumstances, she could walk out of the monitor, couldn‚Äôt she? If people could bring something as abstract as programs to a semblance of life, what was stopping the cute office worker from physically emerging and declaring her love for him?



Derrick knew these thoughts were insane, childish, and stupid. He thought them anyway. The fantasy itself was fun and any distraction from his life was a welcome one.



This has nothing to do with the curse Derrick brought upon himself, except for one specific thought he‚Äôd had before passing out in his chair with pajama bottoms still wrapped around his ankles: A wish and a prayer that *something* could come out of the confines of his expensive piece of machinery to make his life interesting.



*Anything.*



In his dreams, both nights, his monitor appears disassembled into odd shapes. The shapes shudder before moving into place; the dimensions of it locking into place with a *snap.* The cute office girl appears inside, her smile red with blood.



The second night he has this dream, he realizes a mechanism behind the curse, and it has to do with that one word:



*Frame.*



The concept of a frame. The way word and idea click together in a burst of synapses. He woke up in a freezing sweat that first night but had forgotten what the nightmare had been after realizing that he was late for work. The blood and pus had been there, but it had gone unnoticed. He isn‚Äôt so lucky now. He‚Äôs remembered the dream this time, and this one was longer than the first.¬†



Along with the frames of the screen, there were four iron bars with wheels on each end.



The iron bars rotate in the dark void of the dream. A mattress appears. So do bedsheets that look a lot like his. The bed comes together with a *click* as the frame locks into place*.* Derrick sees himself below the covers. Arms are reaching for him from under the bed.



His eyes shoot open. Moon and streetlight filter through the blinds on his window and cast cold blue bars around his room. Derrick wishes, *begs,* with the fibers of faith he still has left that he could have stayed asleep forever.



The light from the blinds is illuminating silhouettes around his bed. Some things, or some ones, are climbing over the edge of his mattress. All he can make out are their glassy eyes and rotten teeth.



Hands clamp down over his shoulders and mouth, pinning him to the bed. An iron-like and salty mix of fluids pour into his mouth. His screams mix with it and come out as bubbles between rotten and bony fingers.



‚Äú*Thank you.‚Äù*



The words coming from moving lips don‚Äôt reach Derrick‚Äôs ears, but he can hear their echoes in his head.



	‚Äú*Thank you‚Ä¶‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù*

	*‚ÄúTHANK YOU!‚Äù*



A chorus of gravelly whispers floods his mind while wet hands start to caress his body, the things around him staring at his skin like it was the sweetest, tastiest looking thing they‚Äôd ever seen. The thing restraining Derrick leans in even closer towards his face, its tongue snaking out and reaching for Derrick‚Äôs eyeball.



Derrick jolts, his upper body jumping upwards as his hands claw his mattress. The hands on his shoulders and mouth tighten their grip. He pushes again, focusing the force into his shoulders while rocking his head upwards and catching the chin of the thing trying to lick him. The *CLACK* of its rotten teeth slamming together and severing a tongue is like a gunshot in the silence of the room and gives Derrick another jolt to his senses, enough to put one last shove into the things pinning him down. He wrestles himself free and throws his body over the side of the bed towards the bedroom door. He lands awkwardly, crushing something under his back.



Hot liquid soaks his shirt and paints his back. Something opens and closes against his shoulder blades; it must be teeth because what else could be sliding out of a tight squeeze to try and get at his skin?



The scream that had been waiting so long to escape finally explodes in a bloody mess out of Derrick‚Äôs mouth while he kicks his hands and feet against the ground, pushing himself away from his bed and towards his closet. A second scream, this one much more shrill, goes out when his back finally hits the wall, but he can‚Äôt help himself. He can‚Äôt look away from his bed. The zombies or ghouls or demons or whatever-the-hell are pouring out of his bedframe. At least a dozen are ripping and pulling at each other trying to get to Derrick first.



The mattress is pushed upwards and stands beside the bed, making the scene resemble creatures bursting out of a haunted chest. From beyond the frame itself come screams and cries of pain and pleasure that Derrick can only hear in his head. It‚Äôs so loud it feels like something is trying to break through his skull.



His pathetic kicks against the carpet finally gain some traction. Pushing himself against the wall, standing, then finally running to the bedroom door and pushing it open hard enough to make a doorknob-shaped hole in the apartment hallway.



Mac and Ammy are awake and standing outside of their rooms wearing only boxers and t-shirts. Both had been rubbing their eyes and thinking ‚Äú*what the fuck happened I thought the monitor was far enough away to be safe.‚Äù*¬†



Derrick doesn‚Äôt even notice them. He doesn‚Äôt stop running until he‚Äôs busted out of the apartment‚Äôs front door and into the hallway of their apartment building. Exhaustion hits him with a gut punch as he slides back against the wall and sits on the floor gasping for breath.



To his roommates, he only appears pale and sweaty. Neither see the blood and mucus, but Derrick doesn‚Äôt care. His eyes are on the hallway leading to his room. He can hardly see it as the only light in the apartment is from an overhead oven lamp. Derrick doesn‚Äôt dare look away to even answer his and Ammy‚Äôs questions and doesn‚Äôt dare to blink. For all he knows, he‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôs caught off guard again. Or worse.



‚ÄúWhat happened!?‚Äù Ammy whispers.



Both he and Mac join Derrick in staring back into their apartment, even if they know they can‚Äôt see anything.



‚Äú*MY BEDFRAME!‚Äù*



Derrick, having forgotten where he is, screams the words even louder than he‚Äôd screamed for his life. Mac‚Äôs palm quiets him down with a hard *slap* to his mouth that also serves to help focus his roommate.



‚ÄúMy bedframe,‚Äù Derrick whispers. ‚ÄúThey came from my bedframe!‚Äù



Ammy and Mac double check that none of their neighbors have come to cuss the three out. They haven‚Äôt. Closed doorways line the halls, and no heads poke out to check for the commotion. Luckily the residents on this floor are drug addicts that are too tired or too used to their own noise to care.



Derrick squirms against the wall, eyes still on the corner that rounds to his room. He knows that one of the things will come around it. Any time now. Yet, he‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it; His hands are wringing his pajama bottoms so hard that his knuckles blanch. But he‚Äôs okay. Even if they come around the corner, they‚Äôre still far enough away from the doorframe-



*CLICK*



The door into their apartment is gone. In its place is a door into a horrible burning place. A pile of red flesh tries to surge through the doorway but is quickly jammed into the tight hole in less than a second. Yet even more terrifying are the sounds behind them.



A melody and a beat. Both accented with meaningless shouts that do their best to be lyrics to a song that cannot have any. A song of agony that leaves little room for words; Except for a name. They call for Derrick. Threaten, plead, bargain, all while they reach as hard as they can with whatever limb will fit through the gaps in their squeezed form.



In some spot of the cacophony, one word is clear:



*Inevitable.*



It rings in Derrick‚Äôs head as he wrestles out and away from Ammy and Mac‚Äôs grip on him to get away from the new opening. The two look shocked only long enough for the ghouls spilling out of the door to climb around them. Some take useless bites at the exposed flesh, breaking their teeth and cracking their jawbones. For the two roommates, all they feel is a cold several times more severe than what they‚Äôd felt from Derrick‚Äôs monitor. They want to call after Derrick as he runs down the wall, but what if the cold flows into their mouths or their bodies?



Doors are opening left and right in front and behind Derrick as he runs. Bodies pile out of each, so brittle yet so hungry that they twitch and buckle as they try to chase their prey. It‚Äôs impossible to keep track of them all. His sanity drops with the room numbers until he finally makes it to the end of the hall. He‚Äôs been running for the stairwell, but bodies are already falling out of it when he‚Äôs only thirty feet away.



The area of effect, the bubble of whatever his curse was, was growing.



The elevator opens as soon as he thumbs the button with an arrow pointing downwards, earning a squeaky but victorious cheer from Derrick as he jumps inside and hammers the ‚Äúdoor close‚Äù button. He presses it so hard that he nearly breaks his thumb. Sadly, the elevator being available is the last victory he‚Äôll get. No doubt he wouldn‚Äôt have celebrated if he knew he‚Äôd only delayed his inevitable and bloody end by a few hours.



The elevator stops suddenly, throwing Derrick‚Äôs stomach into his throat. He stumbles out into his complex‚Äôs pathetic excuse for a parking lot, where garbage and thieves spend pleasant evenings sharing gnarled potholes and cracked cement with the local feral cats. For his own feet‚Äôs sake he slows from a run to a brisk walk. Thorns and broken glass dig into his foot but that‚Äôs a phantom pain far removed from the image of the things chasing him.



He stops at the border between the lot and a wildlife conservation park that conserves nothing but a homeless camp. His truck is here, and he clambers over the tailgate, the entire frame shaking-



*CLICK*



A few of the homeless in the nearby park wake up in a daze from the sound of a man screaming and running through the woods about his truck trying to kill him.



\-



One of the few instances of a truce between fentanyl-addicted, insane homeless people and those who wear badged-blue button-ups with guts that spill over their belts: Death.



Death is a fantastic mediary, especially the morning after Derrick first noticed the heads in his computer.



Officer Vasquez and Julie Buckham, both persons new to their respective fields of law enforcement and homelessness, walk to the middle of the now-evacuated tent town in the park.



‚ÄúReggie brought him to the fire,‚Äù says Julie. ‚ÄúHe was screaming, losing his fucking gourd about things coming to kill him and how he was ‚Äòdead fucking meat‚Äô and tons of other shit. I knew he was on acid, probably white too, when I first saw him. Son of a bitch needed to calm down before his heart exploded. Isn‚Äôt that ironic?‚Äù



Vasquez nods and concentrates on keeping his legs from shaking as they approach the body of the poor bastard. One of the homeless had had a phone. Vasquez, being a ‚ÄúFucking New Guy‚Äù to most of the force, had to handle the call. The phone operators had dismissed it as the delusions of the local ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù. None of them believed it, and Vasquez thought he didn‚Äôt, but the description they‚Äôd given him had still freaked him out:



A man‚Äôs head had spontaneously exploded.



His legs shake a little as he and Julie pass the last line of tents before hitting the center of the homeless camp. The body is there, laying against a hollow oil barrel. Blood was everywhere, radiating outwards all around the body, whose face and neck had survived the explosion. His skull had not.



Two things about the carnage immediately stand out to Vasquez, both of which he‚Äôd later recount in pop myth conspiracy books and local conventions he‚Äôll be asked to attend:



* The man‚Äôs parietal bone, the part of the skull that starts at the very top of your head and ends at the bend towards the back, had exploded in a bloody bomb. But *only* that section. The forehead, face, and upper neck were completely unaffected. His last living act, to make a tortured and anguished scream, was still frozen on his face.
* The pool of blood both in front of and *behind* the corpse. There was far, *far* more than a single person could hold. It even circled the oil drum in a way the blood couldn‚Äôt have landed from the shape of the exploded skull. Bare footprints are dotted throughout the blood, even though the homeless all wore slippers and shoes. Vasques had seen them for himself. They‚Äôd all run a mile away and wouldn‚Äôt take a single step back the way they‚Äôd come. Vasquez didn‚Äôt blame them.

	

‚ÄúWho ran through here?‚Äù Vasquez asked. It wasn‚Äôt the first verb that ran through his mind though, that was ‚Äúdance.‚Äù There was an odd pattern to all of the footsteps that reminded Vasquez of footprint covered dance tutorial sheets.



‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúWe all bugged the hell out. I watched this place the entire time while I waited for the cops to get here, and nobody touched the place after he‚Ä¶ He‚Ä¶‚Äù



Julie recounts for the third time that morning how she‚Äôd brought the screaming man to the fire barrel. Someone had been after him, but he‚Äôd refused to explain who. He‚Äôd been certain that his life was over. Julie sat with him and shared some of her food and listened to him talk, mostly repeating disparate scenes from the previous two days.



‚ÄúBy -*hic-* by the end, he‚Äôd actually started to calm down a bit. He even seemed hopeful, like he could figure out whatever the situation in was, and then I said something and he fucking *DIED!‚Äù*



Julie moves away from the body and squeezes her throat to keep what little she‚Äôs had this morning from coming up her throat.



‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù Vasquez asks, his own breakfast at his throat. ‚ÄúThe last thing you said to him, I mean.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat he had a good outlook,‚Äù Julie says. ‚ÄúThat he had a pretty good frame of mind.‚Äù

My wife and are making our first trip to Tokyo in November. While we plan on taking some day trips to areas around (mainly Kamakura, Oshino Hakkai, and Yokohama), we will primarily be staying on Tokyo. We'll have about 7-8 full days for Tokyo exclusively. 

Our goal for this trip is to take things fairly relaxed. We have very very few things that are actually scheduled because we want to be able to drift around on vibes and follow our whims. We're mostly trying to avoid the most over-touristed activities (to the degree that we can).

**Shibuya**, **Shinjuku**, **Harajuku**, and **Akihabara** are four areas we plan to quickly pass through just to be able to say we went there but we don't really have any plans to linger in any of those areas. (Plus, as a Yakuza fan, I have to make a pilgrimage to Kabukicho.)

We've tried to curate a list of areas to pick from on a daily basis. This way we can wake up every morning and feel out our mood and just pick something from the list - no firm plans for any areas, just a chance to explore different spots. 

Our hotel is in **Koenji**, so naturally we'll spend a bit of time there, as well as **Nakano** as it is nearby.

The other neighborhoods currently on our list are:  
\- **Shimokitazawa** (we have plan on going to a couple live music shows at night here, maybe wander some vintage stores during the day)  
\- **Sangenjaya**  
\- **Yanaka**  
\- **Kichij≈çji**   
\- **Kagurazaka**

Are there any other neighborhoods that y'all would recommend? Is there any reason to drop any of the above areas from our list? Activity-wise, we just want to eat some good food, browse some chill shops, and drink some good beer. We're not really into museums, but we do like parks. So far, my ""itinerary"" is just a list of neighborhoods and misc. things to possibly check out in them - not as firm ""you have to do this"" but as as ""if you don't stumble upon anything, here are some things you could do.""

Forget the noise of the week for a moment. Forget the to-do lists that haven't been touched and the inbox that's already screaming. Right now, it's just you and the potential of a brand new, untouched Saturday.

This day is a blank canvas. It‚Äôs not about grand, life-altering gestures (though if you have one in you, go for it!). It‚Äôs about the small, stunning moments that collectively make a life worth loving.

Maybe your ""stunning"" today looks like:

¬∑ The stunning clarity of a quiet morning walk, where the only sound is your breath and the birds.

¬∑ The stunning taste of a perfectly brewed coffee, enjoyed slowly, with no rush.

¬∑ The stunning feeling of crossing one single thing off that list you've been avoiding. (The momentum is real!)

¬∑ The stunning connection of a real, heartfelt conversation with someone you love.

¬∑ The stunning pride in trying something new, even if you're awkward and bad at it.

¬∑ The stunning peace of an evening spent reading a book that changes your perspective.

¬∑ The stunning courage of taking one small step toward a goal that scares you.

You don't have to do everything. You just have to do something that makes you feel alive. Something that reminds you of your own strength, your own creativity, your own capacity for joy.

So here's your challenge for this Stunning Saturday: Don't just let the day happen to you. Happen to it.

Do one thing today that future-you will look back on and be grateful for.

Now, go out there and make it stunning. We're all rooting for you.

# Step 1 - Open

There is a detailed [guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Rabbit+R1+Teardown/176654) and many youtube videos that show how to open the R1 gently.

Thing is - I don't have a heatgun, so I had to improvise. I was contemplating just chugging it in the oven, but I came back to my senses (‚Ä¶which happens about twice a month on average) and remembered that I have a filament dryer that goes up to 70C/160F. Put it on full blast and held the R1 directly into the airstream. Only 5 broken guitar picks later - the rabbit was finally open. RIP to the real MVPs - Fender Mediums, gone but not forgotten.

In my excitement I pulled away the back cover and immediately ripped out the battery connector. Don't do that >:( Lucky it was some ""zErO fOrcE"" clicky thingy that pulled out without damaging it or ripping the ribbon cable.

# Step 2 - The battery connector

https://preview.redd.it/ac3fyqyj0ltf1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0df42df53afaac309b2fff2bd3313bdb0b108b2

You probably can cut off the old batteries flat cable and solder directly to it. But I wanted to preserve the old battery for debugging. I could not find a fitting connector online. Not on amazon, nor any of the ali\* or taobao sites. There is also not a single replacement battery for the R1 on the market as far as I can see, which sucks.

I attached the original battery, dug out the multimeter my grandpa left in my name and got to work probing around the board and connector. It seems the connector has 6 pins. 2 are for GND, 2 for VBAT, 1 does nothing and 1 is NTC which I didn't bother to google and had no clue what it does. On the battery PCB it seemed to not be connected to anything, but it had a little ""T"" which should have been a clue.

Luckily the creators did an unusual thing and added [debug pads](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Rabbit+R1+Chip+ID/172517#s368340)(top left) for the battery voltage. Which we can use later to solder our new battery directly to them.

One of the pads absolutely refused to stick to the solder. I kept wiping it with a q-tip soaked in alcohol. Still no sticky WTF. Took out a boxcutter and roughened it up, which finally did the trick. Sometimes brute force *is* the correct engineering solution after all!

I did my best in a state of absolute sleep depravation, which ended up with this cursed, twisted mess. It could be improved HEAVILY by just making a proper 3 pin connector with a clicky locky thingy, instead I took whatever I had closest at hand.

https://preview.redd.it/h8li6voy0ltf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f4c4cc18ff50c54278d9de9c72ecb0421a3dba8

Don't forget to absolutely smear that shit with glue, or you risk ripping out the pads later. (Don't ask me how I know)

# Step 3 - The battery

I got myself a 125050 sized 4Ah battery. (What marketing squid came up with the ingenious ""4000 milli Ah"" naming scheme anyway?) You can get them for like 20 shekels on amazon. It pretty much matches the R1 battery footprint while being quite a lot thicker.

https://preview.redd.it/8iadez061ltf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0378b45b8b151f7e9be68166b2b864fca96a217

Thicc battery = thicc endurance. Simple math.

The voltage doesn't quite fit - 3.7 vs 3.85 but there are no 3.85V batteries in this physical size/format out there as far as I can tell so whatever man, close enough.

My hope was that the chip responsible for the battery is smart enough to be trained by cycling it from full to 0 a couple of times.

So I just slapped the battery onto my newly solder connection, turned it on aaaaand - no bueno.

Plugged in USB charging aaaaand - no bueno!

Remember the little ""T"" and NTC from before? Yeah turns out thats a thermistor. It tells the system when the battery overheats and the device doesn't turn on when that shit is not present.

I dug out the multmeter again, measured the resistance of the T pad and breathed on with the warmest breath I could do, which lowered the resistance.

Luckily, I had exactly the needed 10k Ohm thermistor lying around. It came with an ASUS ROG motherboard that I bought 10 years ago lol. But you can easily find them [online](https://www.amazon.com/Thermistor-Thermistors-Resistors-Temperature-Sensor/dp/B0F3X2G4D2) for under a dollar. Plugged it in for testing and it booted like a charm. Hurray!

You could even remove the battery and have the R1 powered on from USB 24/7 that way without burning through battery health.

For the final assembly I just jammed the thermistor into the battery tape that holds it's protective circuit, which is hopefully good enough.

# Step 4 - The gaping backhole

Now that everything worked in a lose state on my desk it was time to come up with a way to package it all back together.

Fusion 360 doesn't run on my PC, freecad is unworkable, so I went to work in blender. Yeah yeah I know, wtf am I thinking, blender for 3d printing modeling, are you a masochist?

Thing is, thats the only tool I at least used a bit before in university, so getting used to it was alright.

I took a wooden ruler (yeah I don't have calipers, deal with it) the R1 and my eyeballs and went to work.

Because I am an idiot, I did not care to check for [existing R1 models](https://www.printables.com/model/725466-rabbit-r1-ai-device-reference-design) before starting and did everything from scratch.

About 4 hours later and I am kind of proud of the result.

I printed it out and did some minor tweaks for fit and finish.

https://preview.redd.it/7mkwcl9x1ltf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4f2410b1e64f5a5aa7eaaa2dbda5353df33b117

I designed it in two parts so that both flat areas have a clean look by being directly on the print plate. I tried both smooth and textured versions and ultimately prefered the textured one.

Here is the very last photo before gluing everything back together.

To glue it cleanly I ordered a syringe set with flat needles for precision crafts, which really helped to apply the glue evenly and quickly without spilling over.

# Step 5 - Battery training

During the first couple of days, I thought something was really broken. The battery percentage would not move at all. No amount of charging, turning it off and on again, would move it from the 7% mark.

Then I thought something was REALLY broken, when it kept saying ""connecting..."". I thought maybe the battery discharged a bit and due to the lower 3.7V the wifi chip stopped working.

Turned out the rabbit team did an [oopsie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbitr1/comments/1nvlaz5/anyone_else_have_the_below/) and their services were down... Oh well.

I charged it overnight again, then rebooted and suddenly it showed 100% battery!

I tried using it as much as possible to drain the battery faster, so I taught it how to read aloud a random wikipedia article in teach mode (Which took 5 attempts to get right). Now it just reads random stuff to me all day. Some weird artist that nobody heard of? An exoplanet orbiting a distant star? Battle of Ia Drang? Give it to me raw!

https://preview.redd.it/00mukvo04ltf1.png?width=2148&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b55649718c9ca8adaca05df2987eb587c20425

Now a couple of days have passed and it started slowly moving the battery percentage to 92%. Which I suspect is still wrong, but I take it as a good sign that it will evetually fall in line with the actual charge.

By now it has been on for 6 days (!!!) and the battery percentage says 86%. I will update the post when it finally drains.

# Conclusion

If you made it this far, congrats - you are now a certified R1 hackerman.

To recap: it took about two and a half days of work, lots of coffee, alcohol and some frustration. But now I have a BIG PHAT battery in my R1, which is a godsent. It is still very comfortable to hold and as a bonus, it can now lie flat on a table because the wheel doesn't stick out on the back anymore.

One thing I was too lazy to even attempt is to add a piece of acrylic to cover the camera hole. I think I'll work that if I ever do another one of these mods.

If you want to attempt it yourself, I hope this is somewhat of a decent guide and link collection. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments.

If you want me to do it for you, hit me up via PM with what you think it a fair deal.

I've put the model up for sale over at [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1437106-rabbit-r1-back-case-for-battery-upgrade) cause I'm broke and it was a bit of a pain in the ass to make. Would have put it up for 1$, but the site dictates a minimal price.

Which is exactly what I was hoping because that dynamic just is and is something I‚Äôve learned to manage and isn‚Äôt a main focus in my life. I thought that largely spoke to her abilities any other reader would have dwelled on this but she moved on! I initially got this as a love reading but my cup had other plans. As many others I got this reading due to an end of a great relationship. I have always ignored the voice in my head that has said ‚Äúthis break up happened because love is not important for you right now. It is not the right time to be focused on love. You need to focus on your career and dreams.‚Äù And the cup reflected that. The part of the cup dedicated to any insight about love in readings was faint and had little to no coffee grinds to read but the area that was most potent and had the most coffee remains to read was about my future as an attorney and the journey to get there.

1o00c7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoanMarketing/comments/1o00c7t/delonghi_magnifica_evo_review_easy_milk_drinks/,De'Longhi Magnifica Evo Review: Easy Milk Drinks with LatteCrema,"If you‚Äôve ever tried to replicate caf√©-style cappuccinos or lattes at home, you already know it‚Äôs rarely as simple as it looks. The **De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica Evo** tries to fix that with a one-touch system built around its famous **LatteCrema** technology. I‚Äôve tested a lot of fully automatic espresso machines over the years‚Äîfrom Philips and Jura to Breville‚Äîand this one sits right in that sweet spot between convenience, price, and taste. Let‚Äôs break down what it really delivers in everyday use.

---

## First Impressions and Key Features of the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo

### Unboxing and Design Aesthetics

Right out of the box, the **Magnifica Evo** feels like a solid, thoughtfully designed appliance. It‚Äôs not overly bulky, yet still has enough presence to look premium on the counter. The matte black finish (with chrome highlights) is subtle but modern, and the touch control panel is well laid out with intuitive icons‚Äîno deep menu diving needed.

Build quality matters more than people realize for espresso machines, and De‚ÄôLonghi‚Äôs been improving in that area. The doors close snugly, the dreg drawer fits perfectly, and there‚Äôs no creaking plastic when you press buttons. It‚Äôs the kind of engineering refinement you notice if you‚Äôve handled a few cheaper automatics before.

### Core Technology: Understanding the LatteCrema System

Now, the **LatteCrema System** is really the headline here. It‚Äôs a self-contained milk frothing system that automatically textures milk for cappuccinos, flat whites, or lattes‚Äîwithout manual steaming. The secret is the dual thermoblock system: one heats water for espresso, the other controls milk temperature and foam density.

You get a nice, consistent microfoam layer, closer to what you‚Äôd expect from a caf√© machine. And the milk carafe detaches easily, so you can pop it back in the fridge (a small but underrated convenience).

What I like most: it‚Äôs consistent. You can make two drinks in a row and they‚Äôll taste identical. That‚Äôs not always true even for pricier competitors.

### Key Specifications at a Glance

* 13-setting stainless steel burr grinder
* Dual thermoblock heating system
* 1.8L removable water tank
* Removable LatteCrema carafe
* Touch panel with one-touch drink options (Espresso, Coffee, Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato)
* Height-adjustable spout (to fit larger mugs)

This is the kind of setup that makes sense for someone who wants barista-style drinks but doesn‚Äôt want to spend ten minutes steaming milk by hand.

---

## Hands-On Performance and User Experience

### Testing the Coffee: From Espresso to Americano

Let‚Äôs talk about the actual cup quality, which is what matters most. The **delonghi magnifica evo** delivers a balanced espresso shot‚Äîstrong enough to satisfy, yet smooth enough for everyday use. I found that the medium grind setting worked best for standard espresso, but if you prefer a stronger extraction, dial it one step finer.

Temperature consistency is solid, thanks to the thermoblock setup. Americano drinkers will appreciate that it doesn‚Äôt scald the water or dilute the espresso too much‚Äîa common issue in cheaper machines.

### The LatteCrema System in Action: Creating Milk-Based Drinks

This is where it shines. The **LatteCrema system** delivers thick, glossy milk foam with minimal fuss. Cappuccino lovers will appreciate that tight, micro-bubbled foam‚Äîit‚Äôs not the bubbly, over-aerated type that collapses in a minute.

Flat whites and lattes come out equally balanced. You can actually hear the system regulate air injection during frothing, which tells you the machine is managing foam texture dynamically (not just blasting steam).

Some people complain that automatic systems can overheat milk, but here it stays pleasantly warm, around 60¬∞C‚Äîideal for preserving milk sweetness.

And yes, if you want to go straight to Amazon for pricing or availability, you can check it out [here](https://amzn.to/46PMJS8).

### Daily Use, Cleaning, and Maintenance

This part is always less glamorous but so important. The **Magnifica Evo** keeps it pretty simple:

* Automatic rinse cycles when powering on/off
* Easy front-access dreg drawer and drip tray
* Descaling alert system
* Dishwasher-safe milk carafe

The milk system auto-cleans after each cycle, but I still recommend running the deeper cleaning function weekly if you‚Äôre using it daily. I‚Äôve learned the hard way that even a thin film of old milk can ruin the foam texture and leave a sour taste.

The grinder is reliable, but don‚Äôt overload oily beans (like flavored espresso types). They tend to gum up any burr grinder over time.

---

## How the Magnifica Evo Stacks Up Against the Competition

### Value Proposition: Is It Worth the Investment?

In the mid-range automatic espresso category (roughly $600‚Äì$900), the **De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica Evo** holds its ground well. Compared to the **Philips 3200 LatteGo**, the Evo feels sturdier and offers slightly better milk texturing. LatteGo‚Äôs frother is easier to clean, yes, but the foam quality from LatteCrema is noticeably smoother and longer-lasting.

Versus Jura‚Äôs entry models, the Evo wins on price and maintenance simplicity, though Jura still edges ahead in long-term reliability and aesthetics.

The tradeoff is clear: De‚ÄôLonghi gives you most of the Jura experience at a friendlier price point. If your goal is consistent caf√©-quality milk drinks without breaking the bank, it‚Äôs honestly one of the best options right now.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo LatteCrema system actually work?

It uses a dual thermoblock system‚Äîone heats espresso water, the other controls milk temperature. The LatteCrema carafe injects air precisely into the milk stream to create microfoam with stable texture. It‚Äôs fully automatic but calibrated to maintain sweetness and prevent overheating.

### Is the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo good for beginners?

Absolutely. The one-touch interface makes it ideal for beginners. There‚Äôs no manual frothing, and the cleaning cycle is mostly automated. Even if you‚Äôve never owned an espresso machine, you‚Äôll get caf√©-quality drinks with minimal setup.

### What is the main difference between the Magnifica Evo and other De'Longhi models?

The Evo integrates the **LatteCrema system** and a more modern interface. Older Magnifica models (like the S) use manual steam wands and simpler displays. The Evo‚Äôs user experience is closer to the pricier Dinamica line but at a lower cost.

### How often does the Magnifica Evo need to be descaled and cleaned?

It depends on water hardness, but generally every 2‚Äì3 months for descaling. The display notifies you automatically. Daily rinsing happens automatically, and weekly cleaning of the milk carafe and drip tray keeps it fresh.

### Can I use pre-ground coffee with the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo?

Yes, there‚Äôs a bypass doser on top of the machine. Handy for decaf or testing different blends without emptying the bean hopper.

### How noisy is the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo during operation?

Moderately quiet. You‚Äôll hear the grinder for a few seconds, but it‚Äôs nothing like the roar of some older models. In a small apartment, it won‚Äôt wake anyone up early morning.

### What type of coffee beans work best with this machine?

Medium-roast Arabica blends are ideal. Avoid oily or dark-roast beans‚Äîthey tend to clog grinders and dull the taste. De‚ÄôLonghi machines perform best with balanced roasts around 20% Robusta if you like a richer crema.

### Does the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo come with a warranty?

Yes, typically a **two-year limited warranty** from De‚ÄôLonghi (plus an extra year if registered online in some regions). Always keep your receipt‚Äîit‚Äôs required for service claims.

---

**Final Thoughts:**
The **De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica Evo** is one of those machines that hits the sweet spot between simplicity and performance. It doesn‚Äôt try to overwhelm you with app connectivity or endless drink presets‚Äîit just makes consistently good coffee with creamy, stable foam.

If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable, easy-to-use machine that feels premium where it counts, the **Magnifica Evo** is worth every penny.

 ¬∑ How: Sit comfortably, close your eyes. Bring your attention to your natural breath. Don't force it. Simply feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, or your chest and belly rising and falling.

  ¬∑ When the mind wanders (and it will, a thousand times), gently note ""thinking"" and return to the breath. This is the practice‚Äîthe gentle return, not the perfect focus.
   
¬∑ Start with: 5 minutes.

2. A Mindful Beverage (Coffee/Tea Meditation):
 
¬∑ How: Instead of gulping down your coffee while scrolling, make it the entire practice.
¬∑ Feel the warm mug in your hands. Notice the aroma. Watch the steam rise. Taste the first sip‚Äîits temperature, bitterness, sweetness. Be fully present with this one simple act.
 ¬∑ This practice grounds you in your senses, pulling you out of your thinking mind and into the present moment.

3. Body Scan Meditation:
  
¬∑ How: Still in bed or seated, bring your attention to the tips of your toes. Notice any sensations there (warmth, tingling, the feel of the sheets). Slowly, gradually, move your attention up through your feet, ankles, calves, knees, all the way to the top of your head.
¬∑ Purpose: This reunites your mind with your body after a night of sleep and pulls you out of ""thinking mode"" and into ""feeling mode.""

Now that things feel lighter and more settled, I thought I‚Äôd open up a little again. Not looking to rush into anything, but it would be nice to meet someone kind, grounded, and real, someone who understands that connection doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated to matter.

If you‚Äôre also in that space where you‚Äôve done some healing and just want to share good conversation, coffee, and some laughs with no pressure, I‚Äôd love to talk. Sometimes the best things start with simple honesty.

Without asking. She used flex pitch to change the vocal track for three notes. I was stunned. I didn't know what to say, and in fact I haven't talked to her about it other than to confirm that she did indeed change it... (I thought I needed more coffee or something.) BTW, it wasn't harmonies or counter melody or anything like that -- it was the main vocal line. She was hired to arrange the song and orchestrate it.

Argh! She's young (20s) and this is her first arranger-for-hire gig, so perhaps it's simple inexperience. Of course, it's work-for-hire and I could use the changes if I wanted to, but I do not want to. In fact, I feel oddly violated by this :(  Perhaps I'm being too precious about it?

1o00738,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1o00738/selfserving/,Self-Serving,"First of all, in small, practical experiments, I was taught how to teach. I informed my students that self-control is a skill that can be learned rather than a matter of luck. I actually believed it, and in the same way, people tend to believe that their left shoe will always fit, I still do.

The whole thing began with a thumbnail. While reading I tapped it. Then I took a bite. It was like biting into a stale apple. I drank some water to get rid of the bitter metallic taste and continued teaching.

It did not go away.

Firstly, I tried to act according to the rules. No hands near the mouth, cold water, and counting breaths. The rules were written on the index cards, and they were posted around the house. The rules I lived by until I stopped. They were the reason for my creativity. I disguised the gloves as sleeves, and I concealed the mirrors. I still discovered little things to take away and eat. Little things that I could call practice.

In fact, I am a very cautious person. I even measure my coffee. I keep accounts that are properly balanced. I set timers, but the timers failed. When the urge to *eat more* grew, it was like a quiet tide. I would say it out loud what I wouldn't do. My voice made and broke plans. I would call to mind the animals that I used to study when I was a young man. I would think of hunger as a map, and would honestly consider the body to be a ledger.

Clever hands are what I got. They learned angles which were new to me. They came upon a corner. I also learned to be accurate. The mess was in my pockets, while the proof was kept behind locked drawers. I told myself this was research; I was both a subject and an observer. I took notes, they're tidy.

When I am standing in front of the mirror at night, I lecture myself with calm words. I mention causes, triggers, and remedies. I tilt my head and smile. I can still remember the salty taste of iron the first time. This recollection is a quiz that I never do well in.

No, there is not a hero in this story. I am finishing with the same small choice that I started with. I reach, take, and eat. The mirror does not judge. It shows my face.

I'll first show what I brought to SEA, then I'll show what I added/didn't need after spending 5 months here. My philosophy for this trip was to only take one bag and a day pack and to take what I have (for example, take my $25 second hand 45L pack rather than buy a new dedicated certain Osprey pack for $350 when I could use that money towards my trip and experiences instead). I prioritize space in my pack over weight. I visited Thailand (1 month), Vietnam (3 months), Cambodia (1 month).

**WHAT I INITIALLY BROUGHT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA**

- 1x 45L pack

- 1x day pack

- Paper documents and passport

*Clothes*

- 1x cap

- 4x shorts

- 1x long pants (useful for motorbike trips like Cao Bang/Ha Giang to avoid sunburn)

- 3x quick dry shirts. Note: I had 2 shirts that were loose and one shirt that fits me well in my climate (not hot/humid) and I thought ""it'll be okay riiiight"". In hindsight, my guide would be: If you are 50-50 over if the shirt is loose enough, it isn't loose enough and buy over there. Take loose clothing.

- 1x sun hoody

- 1x boxer PJ

- 1x 100-150g jacket/alpha fleece jacket

- 2x socks

- 8x undies

Summary:

- Top - 4 (5 with light jacket)

- Bottom - 5 (6 with PJ's)

- Undies - 8

- Socks - 2

*Electronics*
- 1x 10000mah powerbank + 1m cable 

- 1x charger + 1m cable

- 1x charger adapter (southeast asia has a socket that fits type C and type A. I found type A stayed in the socket easier)

- 1x headphones

*Extra's*

- 1x quick dry towel

- 1x sunscreen

- 1x deodorant

- 1x toothbrush + toothpaste

- 1x lip balm

- 1x nail clippers

- 1x hand sanitizer

- 1x shampoo


- 1x first aid kit

- 1x sleeping bag liner

- 3x dry bags

- 1x shoes

All of this added to 4-4.5kg. I heard the advice of bring less and decided to follow that advice, and recommend that advice with a caveat: Southeast asia clothing sizes are smaller. If you are skinny like me, you can find clothes but you will be a size L. If in doubt, go up a size. If you are larger then it might be a better idea to bring more clothes from home. Similar with larger shoe sizes.


**5 MONTH UPDATE - FINAL LIST AND THINGS I WOULD CHANGE IF STARTING AGAIN** (italic means I bought during the trip, strike through means I didn't use at all/one time in trip)

- 1x 45L pack. The bag fully filled up still packed up smaller than the bag frame, so I never got asked about weight issues in the plane despite it being around 7.5kg

- 1x day pack

- *1x sling bag to hold valuables.* I bought this first week in SEA because I heard on reddit about how slings are the way to go. I never liked having it on me and I felt so safe that I found I was going out more and more without the sling and the phone and wallet just in my pockets. It ended up being used to store my passport and backup cash in my main pack. *Next time:* For *my* use case I'd find a lighter and smaller item to hold my valuables rather than the big sling bag I had. I still would have a sling as it was useful to have it as an option to put it over my neck in the airports, but I usually just put it at the top of my pack so I could easily access it when boarding.

**CLOTHES**

- *5x shorts - bought 1x with zippers*. Once again this was a safety measure as I didn't want to avoid being targeted. SEA was so safe I just reverted back to my favourite shorts without zippers, mainly because they didn't fit my waist well. **I was very happy with 5x quick dry shorts on my 5 month trip and if I were to do it again, I would still have at least 1 shorts with zippers and 5 pairs overall**

- *2x long pants - bought 1x pants to rotate with my other pants as I was doing a 5 day Oxalis hiking trip, and I thought an Oxalis pant would be a nice souvenir for me.* If I was not doing any multi-day hikes, I would recommend one pair of thin, long pants (hiking pants e.g. Outdoor Research Ferrosi). 80-90% of the time I wore shorts, but in certain places you need to cover your knees and shoulders (Thailand palaces/temples, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum). Maybe I adapted to the heat by this time, but I felt that Bangkok was much hotter than Vietnam/Cambodia, so I'd try find long shorts that go over the knee to avoid wearing long pants if I was going to temples in Bangkok.

- *6x shirts* - 3 shirts were too few for a beginner like me. I sweated through them all in my first 2 days and immediately decided to buy more shirts. Uniqlo airism shirts were my go to. Remember to size up (I'm a M, and had to go with L to get the loose feeling). These are my favourite shirts now. I also bought a button shirt from uniqlo but a different fabric. Button up shirts are noticeably cooler than loose, quick dry shirts, but that shirt fabric (linen) soaked up my sweat much easier so I'd look for a quicker drying fabric like the airism shirt, with buttons alongside the regular airism shirt.

- *3x long shirts/sun hoody* - Bought 2x Oxalis long hoodless shirts as a souvenir. Next time I'd only bring 1-2x sun hoody and more shirts to save weight.

- 1x Boxer PJ

- Cap. Swapped to one with neck protection.

- 1x 100-150g jacket. Alpha direct fleece. Only used 4 times in 5 months (monsoon season). If you are pedantic over weight, I would probably leave behind to save weight and instead just layer your long shirts if you are cold. If you aren't pedantic over weight, having a very light jacket like an alpha direct fleece means you don't think ""man this jacket is heavy and I wish I left it behind"" because you don't even notice the weight, and it is probably worth knowing you have something warm to wear if you need it.

- *6x socks*. Bought extra because the Oxalis hiking trip you cross rivers everyday and I wanted a dry pair for every day. Turns out I ended up using the same pair of leech socks the entire time. Stick with 2 pairs of socks. If you are hiking, maybe buy leech socks, but they aren't even that bad and you won't know they latched onto you until afterwards. If not hiking, 1-2 pairs socks maximum. You'll probably swap to sandals anyways.

- *10x undies.* Turns out I really liked the uniqlo airism undies, so I tossed out some of my smaller, older undies and bought a whole bunch of these undies. I like bringing lots of undies and would bring 10 undies again.

Summary:

- Tops: 6-8 shirts/long shirts

- Bottoms: 6 shorts/1-2 pairs long pants

- Undies: 10


**ELECTRONICS**

- 1x 10000mah powerbank + *2m cable*. 1m cable was often just a little too short and burned through so I needed to buy another one. The 2m cable is sooo much better in SEA. I'll always use 2m cables in SEA from now on and would buy immediately in SEA (slightly cheaper). The powerbank took a long time to charge, so maybe a faster charging powerbank next time with a visible battery percentage rather than 4 dots?

- 1x charger + *2m cable*

- 1x universal adapter. The universal adapter takes a lot of space in the power plug, and **often when I was travelling with someone else only one of us could fit our adapters in the plug despite there being 2 sockets. If by myself I'd keep the universal charger, but if I was travelling with others I would buy a charger in SEA**. The adapters also sometimes were loose in some hostel sockets, not sure if a local bought one would work better?

- ~~1x headphones. I don't listen to music much and I borrowed off a family member, and it never seemed to hold the bluetooth charge for longer than 2 hours, so not sure what I was doing wrong?? I would downsize to earpods as it takes up less space in my pack~~ This is a personal choice and it all depends on you. If headphones aren't a must, then I would say to maybe look into earpods as they take up less space than headphones - or even wired ones so you can plug it into the aeroplanes and listen to the movies (my phone doesn't have a headphone jack, so this wouldn't work)

**EXTRA'S**

- ~~1x quick dry towel~~. Once again this depends on you. If you are just staying in hostels/hotels/guesthouses, you don't need a towel in the hostels for showering etc. Check on booking.com ""towel"" to see if others mention if you need one or not. If you like swimming, and go to homestays in rural areas, then bring a towel as you sometimes don't get towels in the rural homestays. You can go without one in SEA, but it is nice to bring and they are light so you won't notice the weight (similar opinion to the lightweight jacket)

- 1x sunscreen. Bring from home (if carry on buy in SEA instead), I barely used it and should've used it more. DEFINITELY use on motorbike full day trips as that is when I got burnt the most.

- 1x deodorant

- 1x toothbrush + toothpaste. *Would buy floss next time*

- 1x lip balm

- 1x nail clippers

- ~~Hand sanitizer. Family took hand sanitizer. Would've been nice to have but I didn't get sick despite not having it~~

- ~~Shampoo. Hostels, guesthouses and the one hotel I went to always have shampoo and body soap but never conditioner~~

- ~~first aid kit. Never needed and it more hassle than it was worth (scissors, airports)~~

- ~~sleeping bag liner. Never used. Beds are super clean as long as you don't buy the cheapest option~~

- 3x dry bags. 3 worked well for me (tops, bottoms, dirty clothes). Maybe swap to packing cubes next time, but I wasn't buying packing cubes when I already had something that worked.

- ~~1x trail runners~~ Used for hiking trip. If not hiking I wouldn't bring shoes (or socks) and stick with good walking sandals instead. I tossed at the end of my trip and noticed how much lighter my pack was.


**OTHER STUFF**

- Bought 2 books. Surprisingly more difficult than I thought to exchange books in hostels. I left one book behind at my favourite hostel.

- Hiking sandals. Wore every day excluding multiday hikes and motorbike drives. Sandals are a great go-to in Asia. Maybe should've bought a pair of flip flops so I could wear sandals in situations I didn't want to wear my sandals (e.g. walk along wet beach, walk 50m down the road when raining etc.)

- aloe vera after sunscreen. It is as expensive there at it is back home. Bring from home.

- Journal (and pen)

- 7/11 Poncho. NOT WORTH IT - WHY DOES ~~SHE EVEN HAVE THAT LEVER~~ IT EVEN HAVE BUTTONS?!?. I would go for an umbrella instead. More versatile, doesn't rip easily unlike the cheap piece of plastic, can use it in the sun and the best part is that it protects the phone better when you are holding it whilst navigating when it rains. Poncho's work (although get a slightly more expensive one than the $2 one) but umbrella's are more versatile.

- 1x Pocket knife. Amazing for cutting up food. Next time I'd bring some lightweight cutlery and packable plate for fruit. Just make sure it is under the airport knife size. I lost mine at the airport because the airport guy said scissors and threw my FAK scissors away without measuring them (they were never a problem in the international flights I had), so I thought it would be a good idea to give him the knife even if he didn't mention it.

- **Next time I'd bring a number lock as some hostel lockers don't have locks on them. I never used one and didn't have an issue but kept forgetting to buy one, and you'd rather have the security knowing your locker is locked**

- Water filters aren't necessary. You can't drink tap water (usually they have the 10L bottles that you can fill up yourself) so just use your own water bottle, or buy water bottles.

- Zip lock bags are great - especially the largest size ones. Next time I'd not use a zip lock bag for my bathroom stuff as it stunk very quickly. Using it for my towel or journal worked great and they never stunk



And there you have it. That is everything I carried with my on my travels. It ended up being 6-7.5kg at the end, but I had other souvenirs like a homestay host giving my honey which I used during the trip, or carrying coffee beans for 1.5 months, or learning my lesson that M sized undies are not the same size as M back home (and I didn't want to throw out brand new undies). I guess a lesson I learnt is that *it doesn't matter if you bring too much and end up carrying things around for no reason in your first trip to SEA*. You mostly use your day pack anyway so it doesn't matter if something is 4kg or 8kg - I only ended up using my 45L bag when transporting it onto a bus or van to the next town.",3,1759795966.0,southeastasia,0,1.0,False

After a couple of months of back and forth with the county the came out with a purchase price of $435,000. It wasn't in the budget, so there's a bit of wrangling that needs to happen. But the Council approved the wrangling 5-0.

I wonder what they'll do with it.

King's Liquor changed owners, so it needs to change licenses. New owner did the workshop, it's not too close to anything it's not supposed to be, and city staff approves. Council approved 5-0.

Crime stats are still bad.

The Kennesaw Police Department did get recognized by the Cobb Chamber of Commerce for doing a good job with that murder investigation last year.

History kid did a presentation on Wade Green. Turns out Wade Green moved to the area from North Carolina and was just so socially active the name was applied to his road, and it became official in 1952 shortly before his death. The General Store he ran was donated to the city in 2001 and is currently in the parking lot at Adam's Park across from the Recreation Center.

In Public Comment the candidates spoke. Don Does It said he went to the concerts on Friday and Saturday as well as the Coffee With A Cop on Wednesday. It all went well, he was impressed. Bother spoke next, complimenting Councilor Orochena for leading the dances at the concert Saturday. He also said that he appreciated the challenge his opponent was taking on with the PHD, and that his own wife is going for a PHD in education.

Now it's time for the wrap up:

City Manager said they've been crazy busy with events, and it's a ton of work. They already starting to work on next year's concert series. The city has 200-some employees and he's pretty sure that every last one of them helped out with some event or other, but even though the concerts are over for the year the events aren't. Taste of Kennesaw is the next big one.

Councilman Gutierrez-Leon said that he couldn't attend the concerts, but based on what everyone said he wishes he could have.

Councilman Ferris said that he thinks that the city punches well above its weight class in both number and quality of events. He's impressed.

Councilor Orochena said that she was worried that ""Who's Bad"" was going to rained out a second time, but the weather held out for them. She also wants to say that Marie-Louise provided a sterling service at the concert, despite signing up at the very last moment.

Councilman Jones wanted to thank the staff. He couldn't attend events because his kids were sick, and the one really regretted missing the VIP train for the Medal of Honor Ceremony, but he still really appreciates the city's events.

Councilor Viars said that it was good to see people downtown, but didn't wax poetic because she also was sick.

The Mayor said that he really enjoyed the Medal of Honor event, as there were 15 recipients and their families there and he really liked talking with them as the train followed the historical path to Ringgold.",15,1759795836.0,kennesaw,5,1.0,False

How do I handle this?,"Hey guys, I 28M and my partner 25F have been arguing about trust issues. We have been dating for 5 months. At the beginning of our relationship she asked me if there‚Äôs anything in my phone that would upset her if she saw it, she said that she wants to be able to go through my phone and not have to worry about seeing things. I told her I would need to go through my phone and make sure. I started going through my phone and deleted some old photos i had with my exes in my snapchat memories, some other photos I had with other girls, old conversations with other girls when I was still single, etc. 

I told her I cleaned out my phone. Shortly after that she went through my contacts and got upset that I didnt delete some girls numbers because I could message them at anytime. She also didn‚Äôt want me following so many girls on instagram so I sat there with her going through every following and explaining who they were. She got mad at me because when we went to visit my parents house there was a polaroid of me and my ex in my drawer (i didn‚Äôt know it was there because i never go through that drawer). Another time she went on my messenger and read through old conversations with my ex and got mad that I still had them, the conversations were from over 4 years ago. She says that the only thing she asked of me was to clear out my phone so this wouldn‚Äôt happen and that I hurt her by not doing this and this is why she has trust issues. On another occasion when we were in a different city to attend a wedding she went through my viber conversations on viber and found a convo where i messaged an escort while I was travelling a year before we met. I‚Äôve never paid for sex and I did that out of curiosity/boredom when I was solo travelling europe. Seeing that really hurt her and she cried alot that night. I did delete a bunch of my viber messages but that one wasn‚Äôt a saved number and i missed it when deleting stuff. Anyways after that incident I went through my entire phone again to make sure and told her it was good to go. I was hoping things would be great going forward but I was wrong. She then found my old iphone in my nightstand drawer while I was at work that hadnt been turned on in probably 3 years. She was on the phone with her sister at the time and says her sister told her to plug it in and see if it works. Well she went through that phone and found old nudes, conversations with my ex, photos, videos etc. When I came home she was visibly upset and that‚Äôs when she brought it up and we fought over it. I told her she never should have gone through it without my permission but she seemed to think otherwise because we live in the same apartment and there should be no privacy. I did agree to the no privacy thing and told her she could look at my phone because I thought it would help her with her trust issues. 

She insists that I always have my phone screen up when I put it down which i am fine with as I have nothing to hide. However, sometimes i forget to do this and she thinks my behavior is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. Today she came home from a nail appointment and I was on the couch with my phone screen down (a habit of mine) and working on my laptop. I made her a coffee and she said she‚Äôll come drink it in the living room. I put the coffee on the table, picked up my phone and went to our office room to get a zyn, I came back and put my phone down. When I got back she questioned me why i went to the room, why my phone was in my pocket and why it was facing down when she got there. She said my behavior was suspicious. 

 When I bring up the fact that she has trust issues she says it‚Äôs because of me and that I failed to protect her by deleting all that stuff on my phone which I said I did. I do feel like I failed her in that sense but I also feel these issues are more deeply rooted. I am deeply committed and loyal to her and I don‚Äôt have a problem with her having full access to my phone. I just feel like her behaviour is controlling and it makes me feel like shit having my trust questioned when I have my phone in my pocket or facing down.

Or do I just need permission?,"Is it weird to keep just one place setting of things if I don't have multiple people using them on a daily basis? Or do I keep a full set of dishes in case of guests? 

For the longest time, I kept a ton of dinner party supplies. Tons of dishes and cups, serving platters and cutlery, etc...then the dinner parties stopped. Big family dinners also stopped. Now it seems like when we have holiday gatherings, everything is disposable, even when I try to pull out the nice stuff, so I've just been giving it all away. But it made me realize that I have so much every day stuff I don't use either. I think maybe keeping just 1 coffee cup, 1 drinking glass, and 1 place setting feels too extreme, but at the same time keeping two of everything for just me almost feels goofy.

  
Maybe I'm just rambling and looking for permission to keep multiple settings (2-4) of dishes just in case of guests...What would you do?

I have the Aer CP2 16l in ballistic for business, it's been great.  

For personal use I'm looking for an 'all purpose' backpack for everything outside of work. In the city, errands, coffee shops, walking light trails, parks, boating, travel domestically and internationally. It will be my take everywhere bag. 

Preferably something a less structured and bulky than the CP2 but not without structure, let's say semi structured. 

Specs
- Similar compartments and pockets to Aer
- Not a hiker looking backpack. 
- Two exterior water bottle pockets 
- No vertical exterior pockets/zippers on front
- Good organization 
- Quality more important than budget
- size 18 L-24 L, ideal size 20L

I'm tempted to get the Aer City Pack Pro but it's a bit too structured and professional/business like to be an all purpose bag for the park boat and trails.

We have two kids together now. Within this span of 5 years, I have felt emotionally unhappy with him. I don‚Äôt know maybe because he‚Äôs comfortable with me that he just stop trying. We have recently moved to our own house and the distance to send my kids are quite far maybe around 20 mins, and I had to leave early at 6.30am to avoid massive traffic jams. Meanwhile my husband has to leave house at 7.20am to go to work with same reasons too, avoiding the traffic jams. Anyway, today was the breaking point for me and it got me up my feet and got me rethinking back what have I been doing with this man??. You see, what happened was he didn‚Äôt wake up on time even though he set alarms on his phone, since he‚Äôs not really a morning person. I woke up at 5.45am get my children ready for school give them breakfast, prepare my husband his usual coffee and woke him up at 6.20am. I said babe wake up, it‚Äôs 6.20 and I am going now okay. He said ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. After I send my children to school, I arrive home at 7.20am and found he was still asleep. Woke him up saying babe you‚Äôre late wake up now, he look at the time, saying stuff to me angrily and said ‚Äú WAS THE SCHOOL THAT IMPORTANT? WHAT IF I GOT FIRED FROM MY JOB?‚Äù. These words he said was really really hurtful. I have been nothing but prioritising my kids happiness and sending them to school for proper education, and he simply said those words because he couldn‚Äôt wake up on his own??

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I feel like it explains a lot of the problems that I had in my life I‚Äôve always had trouble focusing And maintaining my discipline for long periods of time. I went to the therapist and they told me that I had ADHD but obviously with my heart defect My general provider is very reluctant to put me on stimulants until I get it cleared with cardiology now I have been put on bupropion but I was allergic to that now I‚Äôm on Strattera 10 mg and I‚Äôve noticed some positive effects but stimulants after all are the gold standard. When I talk to my cardiologist about starting Strattera, he seemed very relaxed about it. But when I brought up stimulants like Adderall Ritalin Vyvanse, his tone changed heavily and he said that we wanted to run some test before we were able to do that right now. I do have mild pulmonary regurgitation, but he told me that it‚Äôs not really gonna affect me so it‚Äôs nothing to worry about. I also do have narrowing on my coronary branch arteries And it‚Äôs causing me things like a little bit of chest pain and he wants to put me on a treadmill and stress test me but I was given a Holter monitor back in 2023 and I rarely consume stimulants due the anxiety I have around it. I did have some coffee and I went into VT it was non-sustained and it was only for a period of five beats 140 bpm And self terminating. I‚Äôve also noticed that cough medicine has done this to me where all of a sudden I felt like my heart was racing, and I felt some chest pain afterwards. on bupropion the same exact thing happened although I wasn‚Äôt wearing a Holter monitor. I just kind of felt like my heart started racing out of nowhere and I felt lightheaded because I was very anxious. I think but it went away after about 10 to 15 seconds. I don‚Äôt know if this is a VT, but obviously there are cardiologist in here. I‚Äôm asking what are my chances of being able to start a stimulant if I need to because in all honesty without the medication, I‚Äôm not very productive and I have a lot of aspirations that I want in my life and I would be willing to take the risk of taking simulant if it meant that I could achieve the goals that I have for myself, but I‚Äôm afraid that I might not be able to and that‚Äôs causing me a lot of worry.",1,1759795358.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False

1nzzndj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzzndj,Kanade Otonokoji feat list,"(Say hello to my second Goat üêê)

Kanade Otonokoji Intelligence feats:

Abductive reasoning:¬†While investigating Kokoro‚Äôs murder scene, she noticed fallen icicles with carved inscriptions. Using these clues, she deduced the killer before the trial. During the trial, she revealed that the liquid nitrogen was fake evidence and that Kokoro had actually frozen to death in the fridge. She also explained that the dying message represented each icicle as a girl, with the pierced icicle symbolizing Kokoro. Since the pierced icicle was the largest, she concluded that the culprit was the tallest girl, Emma Magorobi.

Manipulation:¬†After psychologically breaking Hibiki, she was able to manipulate her into doing anything she wanted.

Strategy: She took a kitchen knife, butchered Shiro into pieces, and washed him down the drain to dispose of the evidence. She pushed Hibiki's best friend, Ayumi, down a staircase, hospitalizing her and leaving her permanently paralysed. She gave her middle school teacher an extra dose of muscle relaxant and buried him in a hill behind the school to dispose of the evidence. She massacred her makeup coordinator and turned him into sushi to dispose of the evidence, and unidentifiably murdered her parents.

Planning: She would repeatedly murder Hibiki‚Äôs acquaintances to psychologically break her, reducing her to the state of an obedient puppet. She selected sleeping drugs, a medkit, and blood packs for her murder plan. Drugged Iroha‚Äôs coffee to remove her alibi, then lured Setsuka to the pool, electrocuted her, and poured blood on her. When Hibiki found Setsuka seemingly dead, she broke down and entered a trance-like state, completely obedient to Kanade. Exploiting this, Kanade handed Hibiki a knife, and together they stabbed Setsuka, killing her. They then used Setsuka‚Äôs handbook to confuse the gate records. Hibiki placed a ‚ÄúSanitation Time‚Äù sign outside while she dismembered Setsuka‚Äôs body into eleven pieces, cleaning the scene afterward. She hid the torso and sent the chest across the area using one of the Parade‚Äôs robots, accidentally leaving behind antibiotic pills. To create an alibi, Hibiki disguised herself as Kanade using Setsuka‚Äôs severed hand and body parts, messaged Iroha to meet at the Ghost House, and ensured she was seen there. Meanwhile, she used the monorail to dispose of seven body parts via the Ghost House chimney. Once suspicion rose, she collected the hidden pieces, placed them on the altar, and spread blood to stage the Ghost House as the murder scene. When the others arrived, she acted as if she had just entered. Finally, she released Hibiki from her trance‚Äîleaving her with no memory of the crime. She had crafted a flawless plan: a fake alibi, two scapegoats, and a setup where even if they voted for Hibiki or herself, the trial‚Äôs rules would let her win.

Other: Continuously pointed out contradictions during her class trial to psychologically distract everyone. Hibiki described her as a highly skilled dart thrower. Kanade claimed that she was superior to Hibiki in every way, even if Hibiki had given her all, including using her own Ultimate talent. It‚Äôs implied that she may have known about Emma‚Äôs status as a Void before the class trial, but since discovering the Voids wasn‚Äôt her goal, she chose not to mention it. Kanade categorizes people into three groups:¬†herself,¬†Hibiki, and¬†irrelevant people. She would achieve a perfect score if the students were ranked by grades. As the Ultimate Guitarist, she is also highly skilled at playing the guitar. Realised Yuri Kagarin died from an anesthetic substance, because she had smelled it many times before. She also pointed out that the dosage could be precisely controlled.

Thanks internet. No idea how that happens but I probably have an idea now.  the Higurashi ‚Äúretelling‚Äù was boring. It was both rushed and it took too long. If they were going to condense it, they should have condensed it further. It was kinda fun seeing the unexpected twists and satisfying seeing things like the Door Scene and the Doll scene get a happy ending.  But I‚Äôm waiting for the ‚Äúreal action‚Äù to start. 

The Rika murder section was redundant and dragged, with the only fun part being the Akasaka twist that happened with PERFECT timing literally right as I was saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna kill her isnt h-‚Äù? But I‚Äôm waiting for the ‚Äúreal action‚Äù to start. 

So. We FINALLY get to ‚Äúreal action‚Äù and‚Ä¶it‚Äôs‚Ä¶honestly some of the most godawful shit I have ever seen. Holy fucking shit. See, Before I was giving this series kind of a pass for the soulless retelling of events that missed key emotional moments. SOME of those missing moments are explained by differing events. I was just being optimistic, it seems. The writers of this show just don‚Äôt fucking understand the story or its characters. This is slop wearing the series as a skin suit. Literally nothing that made the original good is in this aside from the superficial elements like the nostalgic music and returning voice actors. 


The ‚Äúreal action‚Äù? unbearably cliche afterschool special bullshit and Rika just‚Ä¶like, becomes an entirely different character as soon as school starts? There‚Äôs characater assassination and then there‚Äôs The Last Jedi ‚ÄúJake Skywalker‚Äù level character massacre. (There are actually a surprising amount of parallels) Her entire motivation and personality and memories just disappear into the aether in seconds. This is the most brutal death Rika suffered in the entire series so far. So from now on, since ‚ÄúFurudo Erika‚Äù is taken, how about the name of this Brand New character is Freddy? Freddy Eric! Ricky! My boy Teddy Derrickson!

. 


Let‚Äôs not even go into the plausibility of this scenario. In terms of character history, literally if it was anyone else other than Rika and anyone else other than Satoko this might be believable. They say ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù but Rika basically adopted Satoko as her daughter. This is a 100 year old woman who‚Äôs been looking after this girl for a CENTURY. Took her in and protected her from the entire village. Willing to sacrifice her health to cure her. Flies into a rage when the doctors can‚Äôt cure her. (Remember this?  https://youtu.be/Dj_vGJxnPyw?si=sYKRzYckh_NXQ06p) Falls into despair if uncle comes back. Doesn‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶talk to her anymore when starting high school? What Well, apparently TeddyFreddy forgot all this. 

Because she got‚Ä¶too into being worshipped? Rika is ALREADY used to being worshipped, and having people fawn over her. This is established like literally in the first episode and within like the first 20 minutes of the VN. Rika didn‚Äôt fit in at school either, remember? Neither did Keiichi. How is it‚Ä¶even possible Rika Fucking Furude can‚Äôt immediately figure out what‚Äôs going on here? Well I‚Äôll tell you. It‚Äôs not. But I wouldn‚Äôt put it past THAT Freddy!

Satoko was being bullied and ostracized by an entire village, not just for all of her life but for a CENTURY of Rika‚Äôs life. Erick really can‚Äôt recognize this pattern after seeing it over and over for 100 fucking years?


she knows, more than anyone that Satoko gets prideful when she needs help. It‚Äôs literally one of Rika‚Äôa most painful traumatic memories FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. She literally exhibits this behavior in every scene she‚Äôs in. But FURUDE FUCKING RIKA, who lived with her FOR A CENTURY just gives up after Satoko turns her down ONCE? Of course not. I keep telling you it‚Äôs fucking Freddy! Damn you, Rick! 


This is a fucking century old grandma that literally has multiple lifetimes of life experience and just got through with a multiversal miracle that focused, SPECIFICALLY on interpersonal conflicts. Listening to people hearing them out. She knows what can happen if a tomboy doesn‚Äôt get a doll from a bot she likes. 

if there is one person in tne entire medium of  anime who should never let this SPECIFIC problem happen SPECIFICALLY to Satoko, of all the characters, it‚Äôs Furude motherfucking Rika. That‚Äôs why I despise slick Rikard for killing Rika and replacing her. 

Okay. Let‚Äôs forget everything previously established about the character in other works. This is TeddErick here. in THIS story, Richard herself  literally put in tons of effort to specifically bring Satoko with her just to completely stop that effort as soon as school starts? What is even the logic? They give no explanation, they just‚Ä¶act like this blatant contradiction is natural. 


So let‚Äôs talk plausibility‚Ä¶I know what I said. This just really bad lazy writing regardless of character history. There are 24 hours in a day, over 160 in a week. They have lunch breaks, and apparently free time after class and during class. Let‚Äôs forget that this is a grown ass woman for a second. Are you really telling me that she couldn‚Äôt find time in a 160 hour period to hang out with the girl rhat she shared a house with for over 100 years? Really? She went days, weeks, months without ever checking in on her going for a coffee or some shit? Not even an ATTEMPT to work things out? 

She really couldn‚Äôt get some high school girls who worshipped her to include her best friend in things? Or get better friends? Really? When she herself went through a period of not fitting in? Sorry. I forgot Reddick has no firsthand experience with this, ISNT a fucking grown ass wom who should be more runs capable of understanding some high school girls and just for some reason isn‚Äôt beside herself with worry  to see the girl she would give her life for suffering alone when that is the exact thing she worked to prevent for a MOTHERFUCKING CENTURY. 

NONE of their other friends contacted either of them throughout all of this? None of them? Not a single phone call, visit, letter? Shion, who now sees it as her duty to take care of Satoko, isn‚Äôt worried about them going to the same school that made her miserable? Didn‚Äôt check in? No?





The only way this isnt irredeemable is some kind of ‚Äúblah blah witch bernkastel‚Äù twist about Freddy doing this on purpose or some shit, but that isn‚Äôt going to make this any more enjoyable to watch. Because worse than being character assassination AND bad writing it‚Äôs still fucking boring and I‚Äôm still waiting for the ‚Äúreal action‚Äù. 


I‚Äôm not even gonna talk about Satoko‚Äôs awful writing too. There‚Äôs no point. Honestly I only hope whatever revenge she has is entertaining at this point since we‚Äôre just going full clown mode. At the very least the fucking TEPPEI REDEMPTION ARC is the best part of this so far and not just because it‚Äôs silly, because it‚Äôs unironically the first thing that I kind of wanna see where they‚Äôre going with this. 

Maybe, that whole thing was just really bad set up, and watching mastermind Satoko do goofy things is where the strength in this actually lies and the show is good now. Who knows!

Hi guys, I recently started my masters degree and have been applying to internships (at 230+ apps so far) but haven't heard back from anywhere. Meanwhile some of my peers are getting interviews from a lot of the places I've applied to. I generally think I have a strong resume but I'm not sure what's happening.

I graduated from undergrad in Dec 2024 and worked for 6 months from Feb - Aug 2025 before starting school. One piece of commentary I've heard from a few people (and a recruiter who my friend asked) is that having short full-time experience might be what's holding me back. Do you guys think I should remove my full-time experience?

Another potentially crazy idea is to just say I was interning during the time I was working FT. I know this is a bit extreme but just want to gauge how that might be received

It Came with a Strange Set of Rules. [Part One]","Dear readers: As this is a long story that vastly exceeds the character limit, it will be divided into four parts. With that said, please enjoy the story.



I solemnly pledge myself before God and in the presence of this assembly to pass my life in purity and to practice my profession faithfully. I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug. I will do all in my power to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession and will hold in confidence all personal matters committed to my keeping and all family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my calling. With loyalty will I endeavor to aid the physician in his work, and as a 'missioner of health' I will dedicate myself to devoted service to human welfare.

I still remember the night of the pinning ceremony, the Nightingale pledge, and the feeling of relief for having completed an arduous two years. I was a fresh graduate of my nursing school, excited and proud of all I had accomplished to get to this point. I had passed my NCLEX prior to the pinning ceremony, which had to be delayed due to some rough weather that damaged the recreation center earlier in the month. I couldn't wait to help change the lives of my patients, to do something truly meaningful with my life.

‚ÄúSteven Collins,‚Äù my instructor called my name, and I walked from my place in line to the podium.

Shaking her hand, I thanked her for her role in my education before stepping back into my spot. I had done it; I was officially a registered nurse licensed by the Board of Nursing. I couldn't help but smile to myself, once more beaming with pride. In a blur, the ceremony concluded, and I found myself in the entryway of the auditorium, awash in a sea of chatter.

‚ÄúHey, Steve! You should come with us to celebrate!‚Äù Sarah, one of my classmates, shouted at me from somewhere in the crowd.

Grinning, I pushed my way into the crowd of people, working my way to the sound of her voice.

‚ÄúHey, Sarah, congratulations! We did it!‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYeah, we did! We were fixing to head to the sports bar to celebrate. You should come with us,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou know I'm not a big fan of drinking,‚Äù I said, chuckling.

‚ÄúThat doesn't mean you can't come with us,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúBesides, you could drive us back and save us some cab fare if you don't want to drink.‚Äù

I sighed, smiling, and agreed to go with them. I didn't mind being their chaperon. After all, Sarah had helped me quite a bit in nursing school, so I was happy to return the favor. The night went by in a haze of drinks, laughter, and good food, and before long we were walking back to my car. Once everyone was seated and their seat belts buckled in, I started my car and pulled out of the parking lot onto the main road. Our town was a modest-sized one, with a population of roughly 20,000 people, give or take, so it wasn't uncommon to find the roads deserted in the dead of night. Still, the darkness had an ever-present feeling of unease, one that only abated under the glow of the streetlights. One by one I dropped our classmates off at their homes, until only Sarah and I remained in the car. She lived a bit out of the way compared to the rest of our class, down a dark and winding road that veered into the country.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she murmured, leaning closer to me from the passenger seat.

‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù I asked, feeling myself blush a little. I had a crush on Sarah, but I never did work up the courage to ask her out on a date. Could she be...?

‚ÄúDo you see that building up ahead?‚Äù

Her voice jolted me from my thoughts, and I found myself thankful my face was obscured by the darkness of night. I looked to where she was pointing. Coming up on the right side of the road was a turnoff to a skilled nursing facility. The building stood out like a sore thumb in comparison to its surroundings. It was the only building for miles, its light pushing away the darkness much in a similar manner to the street lights, although there was something off about the light. It made me cold, causing me to briefly shiver. Its brutalist architecture felt out of place in the sea of green surrounding it, as if it were an affront to nature itself. Light spilled out from some of the many windows, but most were dark, as dark as the night itself. It was shaped like a large rectangle, with sharp angles, and stood two stories in height. A derelict sign in front read ‚ÄúNew Haven Healthcare,‚Äù though the bulbs in the letters E, A, and T in ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù had apparently burned out. The feeling of unease had been replaced with one of dread, as if the sign itself reeked of pure malice.

‚ÄúI'd never work there,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI hear the working conditions are horrible and that they have a high turnover rate for their staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt certainly isn't a very welcoming building. If I ever needed rehab, I'd choose somewhere else,‚Äù I replied.

We drove the rest of the way in silence, listening to the radio as I drove her home. After wishing her a goodnight, I walked back to my car and opened the driver-side door to get in. That's when I noticed a pamphlet lying where Sarah had been sitting. Did she drop it? It was an ad for the building we had driven past on the way here. On it were some nurses and staff smiling in a somewhat uncanny way, standing in front of what looked to be a nurses' station. The text below read, ‚ÄúNow hiring nurses for our night shift team. No experience necessary; we'll train you. Join the New Haven family today! After working here, you'll never want to leave. See below for starting pay and benefits.‚Äù

I began to read through the pamphlet and almost had to pick up my mouth from the ground. That couldn't be right. On top of full benefits, the starting pay for the RN charge nurse position was almost three times the rate of the hospital I was planning on applying to. Like many grads, I had a small mountain of student loans that needed to be paid off, and with how much they were paying, it'd only take me a year at most to be debt-free. Hell, I could even buy a nice house on some land, and who knows, maybe ask Sarah out. I folded the paper and placed it in my pocket before heading home. I'd have to sleep on it. Even though the place gave me the creeps, my pay at the hospital, if they hired me, would be around $30 an hour, and they were offering nearly three times that. The starting pay was $85 an hour, an insane amount for this area, let alone a new nurse.

I closed my door and started my car. As the engine sputtered to life, I placed the pamphlet in my coat pocket and began to make my way home. I fiddled with the radio, searching for a station I liked, and saw that it was 4:13 am. There was something almost eerie on the drive back, a certain unsettling feeling that I couldn't quite place. Where Sarah once sat was now barren and cold, a lifeless effigy where the warmth of a dream had since faded. As I rounded a turn, I saw that building once more, though it seemed somewhat darker than it had earlier. As I drove past, I could have sworn I saw a nurse standing in the entrance, smiling at me. Glancing into my center mirror, I saw nothing but the building.

‚ÄúI have got to get some sleep,‚Äù I muttered to myself, returning my gaze to the open road before me.

Checking the center console, I saw that it was 4:15 am, which was odd, considering that from Sarah's house to here was approximately a 20-minute drive. I know for a fact I left her place around 4:13, so how could it only be 4:15? The sudden blaring of a horn released me from the over-exhausted stupor I found myself in. I swerved to avoid the oncoming car, cursing under my breath as I did so. Glancing back down, I saw the time displayed was now 4:35 am. Was I seeing things in this half-awakened state? That had to be it; that was the only logical explanation. I reached down and turned the AC on full blast and shivered. I had never been particularly fond of the cold, but it was a far better alternative than winding up as a patient at the very hospital I planned to apply to.

I finally arrived home, my eyes weighed down by the heavy bags that rested underneath them. I stumbled to the front door, hand fumbling in my pocket for my keys, finding them just as I reached it. I had a habit of putting the keys in my pocket after leaving my vehicle. Yawning, I found the right key and unlocked my door, relieved to be home and not in the back of an ambulance. The pamphlet lay all but forgotten in my coat pocket as I took it off, tossing it haphazardly on the couch; sleep couldn't come soon enough. I kicked off my shoes and plopped down onto my bed, not bothering to do any of the nightly rituals I typically did prior to turning in for the night. Sleep overtook me before long, the pull of drowsiness a force far too powerful to resist.

I opened my eyes, and I was there at New Haven, standing near the entrance. I turned my head to look behind me and saw that the only letters illuminated on the sign were H, E, and L. Scribbled to the right of the L was another L written in something red and dark. A cold wind blew across the entrance, causing me to shiver and pull my coat tightly over my scrubs.

‚ÄúWelcome home, Steven.‚Äù A voice carried over the wind, her voice, a voice that was soft and dangerous, akin to something almost, but not quite, human.

I turned and saw the nurse I thought was staring at me on the drive home. She wore white scrubs and a white cap from a bygone era, complete with white shoes and a brown clipboard in her hands. Her brown hair was tied neatly into a bun, with not a single hair out of place. Her eyes were a shade of blue so bright and dazzling that it hurt to look at them. She wore two golden hoop earrings and had dark crimson lipstick applied perfectly to her lips. Plastered on her face was that same uncanny smile from before, as if she was trying to imitate what a normal smile would look like, but it was wrong.

‚ÄúEh... excuse me?‚Äù I stammered.

Her smile stretched even further, revealing perfectly white teeth without a single blemish.

‚ÄúWelcome home, Steven. We've been expecting you, and we are oh so excited to have you here with us, here with the family.‚Äù As she finished talking, a barely audible cracking sound emanated from her mouth.

‚ÄúHome? Family? What? What are you talking about? This isn't my home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù She tilted her head unnaturally to the side, her smile growing even wider, wider than any human mouth should be. I took a step back and nearly tripped on something.

‚ÄúDo be careful now, dear; we wouldn't want you to get hurt.‚Äù The wood of the clipboard she was holding groaned under an ever-tightening grip, small cracks beginning to form on it.

I looked down to see what I had tripped on, but there was nothing there. Returning my gaze to the nurse, her once pristine scrubs were now yellowed with age, covered in splotches of dried blood. Her once neat hair was now unkempt and threatening to fall from her ruined cap. Despite this, her skin and teeth remained flawless, as if she were a porcelain doll, but that smile... it was far too wide, literally stretching from ear to ear. She took an awkward step forward, as if she were walking for the first time, her gaze piercing my very soul.

‚ÄúYou are going to love it here, Steven. Things have been so stale, and we are in desperate need of fresh blood on the team.‚Äù

I took another step back, not daring to take my eyes off of her.

‚ÄúReally, Steven, you ought to be more aware of your surroundings,‚Äù she said, raising a hand and pointing directly behind me.

A blaring horn sounded from behind, startling me, and I turned to see the white headlights of the car I had nearly hit that night within feet of my face. I covered my head and screamed as the lights overtook me, the horn blaring once more and... ringing?

I jolted up into a seated position, rubbing my eyes. I was safe at home, in my own bed, with my alarm clock screaming at me to get up. Groggily, I reached over and shut it off, rubbing my eyes once more after the silence was no longer permeated by that annoying but effective ringing. Only a dream, I thought to myself; it was only a dream. Even so, my throat was hoarse from yelling, and I could taste a hint of iron in my mouth. Did I scream so hard that I caused myself to bleed?

I swung my legs out of bed and walked into my bathroom, turning the light on as I did so. I turned on the sink, splashing my face a few times with cold water. I've had a bad dream or two in the past, but nothing like that. It felt so real, as if my life was in real, tangible danger. I turned off the faucet, dried my face in a towel I had hung on the door, and headed to the kitchen; I could really use some coffee. After brewing a pot and pouring myself a cup, I sat down at the dining room table, basking in the warm glow of the afternoon sun that filtered in through the blinds. As I set my cup down, I noticed the pamphlet on the table right next to me. Odd, I didn't recall removing it from my pocket last night. I stood up, picking up the pamphlet as I did so, and threw it into the trash.

‚ÄúAfter that dream, there's no way in hell I'd ever work at that place,‚Äù I muttered to myself.

I grabbed my keys and made my way to the front door. The day was already halfway through, and I hadn't put in a single application. I decided I'd start with the hospital and go from there. As the sun started to set, I pulled into my driveway, my endeavors fruitless. Not a single place nearby was hiring, with the closest being an hour's drive from town. I unlocked my front door feeling defeated and headed on in. Driving far wasn't really an option for me, as I tended to get drowsy driving long distances. I plopped down onto my couch, staring blankly ahead. I suppose I could consider New Haven, night terror aside. I put my head in my hands and groaned. With such good pay and benefits, the likelihood of that position still being available was slim at best.

‚ÄúWell, what do I have to lose?‚Äù I asked myself, standing up to retrieve the pamphlet from the trash.

I turned it over, scanning the paper for what I was looking for. Aha! There it was. The facility's phone number. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone, and then dialed the number. It rang once, twice, three times, four times... with each ring my hopes sank further yet. Then there was a click, and a female voice emanated from the phone's speakers.

‚ÄúNew Haven nursing facility, this is Vanessa; how may I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, my name is Steven. I recently graduated from my nursing program and was wondering if the position advertised in your pamphlet was still available,‚Äù I said, holding my breath, bracing myself for the inevitable no that was sure to follow.

‚ÄúLet me put you on hold and check with my DON; I‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù she replied, her voice soon replaced by the typical jingles one often hears when put on hold.

""God, I was an idiot,"" I thought to myself. A golden opportunity was literally handed to me by the universe, and I let it slip, all over a random dream. I cursed in my head. I swore if by some miracle the position was still available, I'd take it without a second thought. If it wasn't, well, I'd have no choice but to apply outside of town. The music suddenly cut off and was followed by a click.

‚ÄúSam, it's Vanessa. Are you still on the line?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's Steven,‚Äù I corrected. ‚ÄúBut yes, I'm still here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sorry about that,‚Äù she said somewhat meekly.

‚ÄúIt's okay; don't worry about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI checked with my DON, and yes, that position is still available. Would you be available tomorrow at four pm for an interview?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes!‚Äù I said ecstatically, almost dropping my phone in the process.

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúIn that case, we'll see you at four pm tomorrow at the main entrance. Please be sure to have your license number on hand so that we can ensure you are in good standing with the board, as well as five professional references. They can be from previous employers or instructors from an accredited program, but family members are not permitted. Does that sound alright with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that won't be a problem,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúOkay. Is there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúNo, that will be all. Have a great day,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou too. See you soon.‚Äù The phone clicked as she hung up.

Before I knew it, I was en route to the nursing home for my interview. I had laid out freshly ironed dress clothes the night before, complete with a tie and dress shoes, and had made sure to shave; I wanted to put my best foot forward for this interview. I pulled into the driveway, glancing at the sign as I drove past it. I breathed a sigh of relief. ""Hell"" was not inscribed on the sign; in fact, a maintenance worker was replacing the bulbs on the letters that were dark the last time I drove past the facility. I chuckled to myself, chalking it up to a mix of nerves and exhaustion. I pulled into a parking space labeled ""guest"" and stepped out of my car, locking the door behind me. I paused for a moment, readjusting my tie in my driver-side mirror, before heading toward the building.

I passed through two sliding glass doors and entered the main lobby, marveling at the interior, which was a stark contrast to the exterior. A chandelier hung from a vaulted ceiling, its light bathing the lobby in a warm glow. To the left of the doors was a sitting area with three comfortable-looking chairs, a padded end table, and a large TV monitor. More chairs, albeit wooden and courtroom-like in appearance, dotted the wall in front of me. To the right was a polished wooden desk where a secretary sat, typing away on her keyboard, her eyes transfixed on her screen. I approached the secretary, clearing my throat as I did so.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said, flashing her a smile.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù She asked, looking up from her screen.

‚ÄúGood afternoon. My name is Steven. I have an interview scheduled for this afternoon for the weekend nights charge nurse position.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne moment please,‚Äù she said, scooting her seat back and bending down over a filing cabinet she had just opened. She flipped through some papers for a minute before finding what she was looking for. She pulled a paper from a folder and handed it to me as well as a clipboard. ‚ÄúPlease fill this out front and back and then return it to me when you're done.‚Äù

I thanked her and secured the paper to the clipboard before taking it to one of the wooden chairs. I pulled a pen from my pocket, scanning the paper as I did so. It was your standard application form, asking for the usual personal information: name, social security number, address, phone number, references, and so forth. I filled out the form, not thinking much of it, until I reached the bottom of the second page, where a small disclosure read: New Haven Healthcare is not responsible for any damage to property or loss of life or limb for failing to follow the facility rules. I hereby absolve New Haven and all its entities thereof from all legal responsibilities in the event I breach either my contract or the rules that will be provided to me upon employment by this facility. I acknowledge I have read and agree to the above.

I held my pen in place over the line requiring my signature. Loss of life or limb? In a nursing home? And what did it mean by rules? I flipped the paper back over, scanning the front to see if anything else was out of the ordinary, but nothing was. It was just an application form. Just as I was about to get up to ask the secretary about the disclosure, her voice sounded from her desk.

‚ÄúSteven, the DON is ready to see you now. If you haven't finished filling out the application, please do so and make sure I have it before you leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, where do I meet her?‚Äù

The secretary gestured to a door directly behind her. ‚ÄúThrough that door, just make sure you knock first.‚Äù

I thanked her and walked around the desk and to the door that was behind her. A small plastic plaque read: Amy DON. I knocked three times and waited. After a brief pause, a voice said, ""Come in."" I opened the door and stepped inside her office. She was a middle-aged woman with a mix of blonde and gray hair, her green eyes resting behind thick spectacles. She sat behind a wooden desk with multiple folders full of documents, her face alight from the computer screen. Hung on the wall behind her were various degrees, from nursing schools to other certificates for continuing education. She lifted her hand to shake mine as I approached before gesturing for me to take a seat on one of the chairs in front of her. I thanked her and sat down, trying to push my nerves down my throat as I cleared it.

‚ÄúSo you're Steven, correct?‚Äù Her voice was soft but stern, like that of a schoolteacher accustomed to dealing with rowdy children.

‚ÄúYes, ma'am. It's a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, likewise. My secretary informed me that you were applying for the weekend... night position?‚Äù She asked, more to herself than me.

‚ÄúThat's correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, I wasn't aware we had an opening on that shift. I could have sworn I interviewed someone for that position a few months ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, my heart sinking. I couldn't help but wonder: was there some sort of mistake causing the job to be listed erroneously?

‚ÄúNo need to worry. It's not uncommon for there to be miscommunications between the shifts. It's very likely that the person may have quit; this job isn't for everyone after all,‚Äù she said, clicking her mouse. ‚ÄúI see that we do have a position available for the weekend night shift. Could you provide me with your license number, please?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, reading her my number I had written down on a piece of paper earlier.

‚ÄúOkay, so it seems you are in good standing with the board. Do you have any experience in long-term care?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis would be my first job, so aside from clinicals, I do not. Will that be a problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, not at all; it just means I'll need to have someone act as a preceptor for you during orientation. Let me see...‚Äù She said, clicking feverishly. ‚ÄúI would like you to train under Felicia and John for a few days each. Felicia works weekdays, and John weekday nights. When will you be available to start?‚Äù

I cleared my throat before replying, ‚ÄúI can start any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù she said, smiling. ‚ÄúI'd like you to come in tomorrow and Friday to work under Felicia. She's the charge nurse on North, one of our long-term halls. Then next week, come in for the night shift and see John. He works South, our rehab hall. If you perform well and are comfortable with taking charge from there, I'll start you on the following weekend. Does that sound fair to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma'am, thank you for this opportunity,‚Äù I said, shaking her hand once more, before stepping out of the office, closing the door as I did so.

I looked at the form the secretary had given me earlier, breathing a sigh of relief to see that strange disclosure was no longer there. In its place was a line that read, ""I hereby attest that the information provided by me is accurate to the best of my knowledge, and that I consent to a background check performed by the company."" I signed on the line acknowledging the above and then handed it to the secretary. I thanked her and wished her a good day before stepping out into the warm evening. For a reason unbeknownst to me, I felt relieved to be out of that building, as if an unforeseen danger lurked within its walls. As I drove away from the facility, I noticed a figure standing in one of the second-floor windows, their shape obscured behind the glare of the sun.

It's strange how time flies sometimes, isn't it? In a blur my orientation was complete, and it was Saturday. I arrived at 6:00 pm, half an hour early, and drove to the back of the building; I would be working on the south side of the building on the second floor. I entered through the employee entrance and went to the break room, as I was instructed to over the phone earlier today by the night shift supervisor. Inside were various tables and chairs, with a fridge and some lockers in the back. A small microwave sat on a table next to the fridge, and two wall heaters hummed beneath the windows.

I walked over to the lockers, looking for my number among the many rows, before finding it: 607. I used the key given to me during orientation and saw a manila envelope resting inside. Curious, I pulled it out and saw someone had written my name along with the words ""Read Me."" I walked to a table near the first window and sat down, taking a moment to savor what little light remained outside, and then opened the envelope. Inside was a single piece of paper with bold font at the top that read, ""Rules for Surviving the Night Shift.""

Rule number one: Do not clock in on the first floor; you can only clock in on the second floor. Clock in at precisely 6:28 pm and not a minute sooner or later. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action from the night supervisor, and trust me, you don't want that.

Rule number two: Only use the stairs located at the end of your assigned hall; do not use the elevators, they won't take you anywhere you'd want to go.

Rule number three: The off-coming nurse will give you a report. If they ask to do walking rounds, politely decline and say ‚ÄúI would prefer we report here.‚Äù If they agree to do so, continue with the report as normal. If they do not, excuse yourself to the employee bathroom to the right of the nurse station and wait 5 minutes. If upon exiting there is a written report sheet, read it and proceed to rule four. If the nurse is still there, immediately clock out and go home; refer to rule two. In the event this does happen, you will receive a full night's pay.

Rule number four: You must begin your shift by rounding on your residents and continue to do so every two hours on the odd hours only. Never round on the even hours. If you fail to do your rounds, hide in the med room behind the desk until it's time for the next rounds. Lock the door behind you and do not open it, no matter what you hear.

Rule number five: When rounding, you will have a specified window in which you must complete your rounds. Refer to the report sheet for the night for further instructions. The lights will begin to flicker when your time is close to expiring. If you are not behind the nurse station before the time limit expires, head to the nearest room with a green flag and knock seven times. If no one replies, enter the room and announce your presence by saying ""nursing,"" then lock the door. If someone does reply or the flag above the door is red, proceed to the next room. Wait in the room until the lights stop flickering; strange things happen in the halls when the veil is thin. After exiting the room, ensure that the green flag is switched to red, or something could follow you out.

Rule number six: Throughout the night you will have tasks to complete at certain times. Always refer to the analog clocks throughout the facility; the digital clocks lie.

Rule number seven: If the pharmacy calls between 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm with a delivery, ask them to wait for you in the stairwell on the first floor. If the pharmacy calls at any other time, tell them the delivery has been rescheduled and hang up the phone; that isn't the pharmacy.

Rule number eight: If at any time you see an elderly woman with long black hair, do not acknowledge her. Instead, promptly return to the nurse station and lock yourself in the med room for 6 minutes. If this happens during your rounds, refer to rule four. Whatever you do, do not look at her face. If you do, not even the door will save you.

Rule number nine: If you hear the laughter of children coming from within a room, you did not; there are no children in the building. Continue your rounds and do not enter the room, no matter what you hear.

Rule number ten: Sometimes the hallways change. If you round the corner and the hallway is different or seems to go on forever, retrace your steps to the end of the hall you came from and turn right. If this is not possible, enter the nearest room with a green flag and close the door; be sure to follow rule five. After closing the door, count to five and open it. If the hallway is still infinite, but you can now make a right, do so. If not, close the door and repeat until either the hallway reverts or you are able to make a right; do not forget to switch the flag to red upon exiting the room.

Rule number eleven: Some of our residents require specific care that may not be listed on the report sheet. Refer to the charts for the care plans of our residents. If you are required to enter a resident's room to provide care, you must knock three times and announce your presence by saying ""nursing."" If a resident refuses care, bow your head and apologize, then leave the room. In the event you find one of our residents in another room or in the hall, escort them back to their assigned room immediately.

Rule number twelve: If the light above the operating room is on, do not enter. If you do, announce your presence by saying sorry for the intrusion. If the surgeon says nothing, quietly exit the room. If, however, he does notice you and asks for help with the operation, you must do whatever he asks you to, no matter how gruesome the task may be.

Rule number thirteen: Never under any circumstance enter the supervisor's office. Scrawled to the side in sloppy handwriting were the words ""unless directed to by her.""

I was brought back to reality by the sound of heavy footsteps followed by the closing of a door. Moments later, another nurse walked into the break room and took the seat across from mine, setting a backpack on the floor next to him. He had short blonde hair and blue eyes, with a face that was clean-shaven; he was reminiscent of a soldier from the Army. I could see the faint outlines of well-developed muscles beneath a pair of baggy blue scrubs. A stethoscope hung around his neck, and beside it was a name badge that had his first name followed by the words ""RN."" He took a long, hard look at me, as if he were summing me up, and then reached out a hand towards me. I shook it, noting a firm grip and a handful of calloused skin.

‚ÄúThe name's Brad, nice to meet you.‚Äù He had a surprisingly soft voice, one that was the complete opposite of his physique.

‚ÄúSteven. Nice to meet you, Brad.‚Äù

‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre the new hire for South Hall then,‚Äù he said, his eyes looking at the paper that sat in front of me.

‚ÄúYes, that's correct, and let me say I'm excited to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThere's no need for that, friend,‚Äù Brad said, waving a hand. ‚ÄúDid you read the rules?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rules? These?‚Äù I picked up the paper and set it back down. ‚ÄúI did, and I have to say, not a bad prank for the newbie.‚Äù

Brad just stared at me, a serious look upon his face. ‚ÄúNo prank, friend. Those are real, and if you want to make it to the next sunrise, you'd best follow them. I don't care if you're religious, nor do I care what god you pray to; that piece of paper right there will be your bible for the duration of your stay here.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me? So you're telling me you got the exact same piece of paper when you started? C'mon, man, it's not as funny the second time around,‚Äù I said, scoffing at him.

‚ÄúLike I said, it's no joke. This place isn't like other nursing homes. There's real evil here, and believe me, if you let your guard down, it will gobble you up like the nurse before you. Why else do you think a position was available?‚Äù He asked as he produced a travel mug from his bag, unscrewing the lid, which functioned as a cup, and poured some hot coffee into it. He raised it to his nose, savoring the aroma carried by the steam, and took a swig of it.

‚ÄúI assumed because they quit.‚Äù

He laughed in a manner that was rather harsh before looking at me. ‚ÄúNobody quits here. Once you sign the contract, that's it; no turning back.‚Äù

‚ÄúContract?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe night supervisor will give you one, depending on how well you do on your first night; a real nasty one, that brute is,‚Äù he said, taking a sip from his mug before continuing, ‚ÄúIf you survive, that is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I... survive?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen closely to me, kid,‚Äù Brad said as he leaned in. ‚ÄúThe supervisor isn't normal; this place isn't normal. The second floor is closed for renovation. It's always closed for renovation, and the day crew doesn't know any better.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook out there,‚Äù Brad gestured out the door to a paper that hung by the time clock. It read, ""Coming soon! The long-anticipated rehab wings!‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you notice anything strange about it?‚Äù

I looked at the paper and saw what he meant: ‚ÄúIt doesn't say when.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. Aside from lacking a date, that paper always remains in pristine condition. I've been here for six months, and in that time, it hasn't changed one bit. No aging, wrinkling, nothing. I've even tried removing it, but it always ends up back there when you look away.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is that even possible?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell if I know, kid, but I think it's the supervisor's doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe supervisor?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't much know what the supervisor is,‚Äù Brad continued, seemingly to not have heard my question. ‚ÄúAnd I don't care to find out, but she's definitely not human. She has a sort of power over this place, a control over what goes on both down here and up there,‚Äù he gestured to the ceiling.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by a kind of power?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe kind that lets her bend reality and warp the memories of the staff that works here during the day. Tell me, when you had your interview, was it the day shift DON who interviewed you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd was she perplexed by the shift you applied for?‚Äù

I thought back to how she didn't know the position was available. ‚ÄúNow that you mention it, she didn't even know there was an opening; she even had to check on her computer to make sure,‚Äù I said, scrunching my eyes a bit.

‚ÄúUh-huh. Pray tell, did she remember anything about the previous nurse for that shift?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo... she didn't.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's because if you die here, you don't just die. This place claims you, and you're erased from the world that exists outside of these walls.‚Äù

I just stared ahead, unable to speak.

‚ÄúYour friends and family? Gone. You never existed. The place you lived? All your belongings just vanish. I know this because I went to the previous nurse's apartment to look for her when she didn't show up for work the next night, and it was vacant.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if you're erased, how did you remember her?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's this place. Like I said, when you sign that contract, there's no turning back. For better or for worse, you're a part of this place now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot to be rude, but how did you get into her apartment?‚Äù

‚ÄúAshley was my girlfriend; I had a key. We both applied for the night shift positions here six months ago, and two months ago this day, she broke a rule; she looked at the black-haired woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúI- I'm,‚Äù I stuttered, ‚ÄúI'm so sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, me too, friend,‚Äù Brad said as he took another sip from his mug. ‚ÄúListen, pal, I don't mean to come across as overbearing; I'm not your father. I just don't want to see you suffer the same fate she did.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by fate?‚Äù I was almost afraid to ask, but curiosity yielded to fear.

‚ÄúI still see her, you know,‚Äù Brad spoke more softly this time, more sullen. ‚ÄúShe often visits me at the nurse station, asking me to go home with her.‚Äù

I shuddered in my seat, even though it was quite warm in the room.

‚ÄúSometimes I see her die in different ways, over and over again.‚Äù Brad raised his cup to his mouth and swallowed the last few gulps of coffee before returning it to the canister. ‚ÄúGod, the sounds that come out of her mouth are enough to drive a sane man to the brink of insanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's horrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye. I often wonder to myself if she's real or not. Am I seeing her soul being tormented by this place, or is she my trauma manifested as an apparition?‚Äù He sighed, looking out the window with a pensive expression on his face, before turning back to me. ‚ÄúWant some advice? Don't sign the contract. If you make it through the night, run and never look back.‚Äù

A beeping sound from Brad's wristwatch signaled that our chat had reached its conclusion. Brad stood up from his seat, placing his mug into his backpack, before turning to me, his face grim.

‚ÄúYou stick to the rules, no matter what,‚Äù he said, and then walked out the door.

I just sat there for a moment, mind still reeling from everything Brad had told me. The way he acted, the serious and almost threatening tone to his voice‚ÄîI didn't think he was pranking me anymore. I read through the rules once more before gathering my belongings and following Brad out of the break room. The shortest route to my hall would be to cut through the kitchen; the stairwell would be next to the emergency exit door on that hall. I saw no staff or residents as I made my way to the stairs, ascending them with fear welling up in the pit of my stomach. Each step felt heavier than the last, and the dream I had days ago returned to the front of my consciousness. Was it a warning?",1,1759793826.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/s/5ppPsx4V8E

I told my husband yesterday I am calling police after he pushed me and I took my phone into my hands. I didn't call as didn't want to deal with police. He was standing in the room and told he is not moving out and I can call police if I want to and if I want the record for him. I asked him to get out of the room. He didn't move. Then I said I am getting out of the room. Then he got out of the room. 
I woke up in the middle of the night from a lot of noise downstairs. And then fall asleep again. 
In the morning he brought coffee and started complaining why I wanted to call police. I told he should watch his hands. He said you yelled at me, this why I pushed you. I responded it doesn't matter, you should watch your hands. Then he said who is going to bring you coffee if you call police. 
When I came downstairs I saw that he clean up all of the mess from kids playing. I usually clean it up myself and complain a lot that I have to. It looked like he was cleaning up at night when I woke up from noise.
I also told him he should find therapist. He usually saying he will never go but this time he was silent.
Did anyone dealt with the similar situation and if there is a hope?
I also just found therapist myself. ",1,1759793615.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

So lets do a little light hearted play‚Ä¶ to see which of your inner senses are stronger than others‚Ä¶

\*\*

To play - you will need to close your eyes, take a few breathes and try each one.¬†

**Hearing**¬†: hear the sound of ambulance or police siren ‚Ä¶¬† Hear the sound of a waterfall - Hear the sound of the birds chirping outside - Hear the Sound of your best friend saying ""OMG OMG OMG"". (Thats inner conversation)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

**Taste**¬†: imagine biting into a lemon or something that‚Äôs really really sour taste it in your mouth - or better yet imagine that you‚Äôre standing in the middle of a supermarket in front of the chips (crisps ) aisle and you‚Äôre trying to choose which chips you want and you imagine what they taste like in your mouth before choosing one. taste the salt and vinegar chips in your mouth. Now try licking money in your imagination.. What does it taste like?¬† ¬† This is an UNDERRATED Sense.

**Touch**¬†\- imagine running your hand along cold ice. Maybe you‚Äôve got an ice block in your hand and you can feel how wet and cold it is.¬† ¬† Pat a fluffy cat in your imagination. ¬† ¬† Run your hand along some gravel in your imagination.¬†¬†

**Smell**¬†\- you have just walked into a local cafe and you can smell the coffee that is brewing. Or maybe you are in the bathroom and they‚Äôve just cleaned it with disinfectant. ¬† Can you smell it?¬† ¬† Maybe your partner is cooking your favourite meal, you walk over the stove, lean over to the food thats cooking and you take a big whiff.¬†

**Sight**¬†\- imagine a coin in your hand, zoom in and look at all the details on the coin in your hand. ¬† There's a red bull can sitting on a bench - zoom in - look at the can, what size is it, is it open?¬† Does it have condensation on the side?¬† ¬† Imagine a rose - zoom in - look at the petals‚Ä¶ ¬† how clear is it.¬† ¬† Try it with eyes open or closed.. ¬† Test all these.. ¬† Try for yourself which one of your inner senses are stronger than the others. ¬† Don't just let the internet tell you what you should do.

i have 2 dogs, i enjoy coffee houses, and i have a garden i tend to every year. i enjoy the beach and the mountains in my area and my favorite time is when its peace and quite. i recently got into games and now im looking for a fantasy game me and my bf can play :) let me know if you find one. I recently got into books (that arent smut) and am looking to read these: the knight and the moth, the second death by locke, and bury our bones in the midnight soil. So if you know a good fantasy book, like the quite lifestyle, and are okay with what im asking for send me a message :) i really wanna find someone special and i hope i can here.

1nzyxa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nzyxa7/20m_20f_one_and_a_half_year_relationship_with_an/,20M - 20F One and a half year relationship with an avoidant made my life miserable,"Me (20M), my ex (20F) with BDP and Avoidant Attachement. It was at the start of College that we first met, we we're pretty close friends at first. She had been in a very abusive and toxic relationship for 1 year at the start of our first year and ended that relationship during our 2nd month or so. After she broke up with her ex, she opened up to me two weeks later saying that she liked me, I had never been in a relationship before and didn't really feel any true romanticism against anyone before either. I also thought her sudden choice of wanting to be with me was not a good one, I also did not know If i had the capability to handle a real relationship so I kindly rejected her saying I didn't feel ready and comfortable. A few months passed by, with her trying to ask me out a few more times, at one point I felt ready both myself and saw that she had recovered mentally from her last relationship, so I asked her out this time. Thats how we started dating. It was very romantic and beautiful at the start but things started to get ugly pretty fast, I thought she was over her ex but she kept bringing him up and past traumas that she went through, this would normally be fine and I was more than glad to listen to any of her problems and help her out when she needed comfort, but she let those past experiences also affect out current relationship. At a certain point she said things like she missed him or that she couldn't forget him, I thought it was maybe normal because human bonds are never easy to sever and get over, I tried to empathize with her. 



But during the 6 month mark of our relationship, she suddenly texted me saying that she needed time alone for a bit, didn't give me an explanation and just ended the conversation there. After a few hours, I saw that she was still online for long periods of time and got paranoid of who she was texting, and what I thought was true, she was texting her ex. I asked her why she did that and she said ''I thought I could do it without him but I cannot, If he can just come to my mind like this and pull me away from you this easily, we wouldn't have worked out anyways'' I tried to reason with her saying that she was just putting herself in danger by going back to someone who clearly abuses her, at that point I was even okay with the fact that we could break up, I just wanted her to be safe because I loved her. Tomorrow morning came and she called me saying she wanted to apologize and make up, I accepted it and we got back together again. 



2 months later, things we're looking smoother but one day, her ex texted her saying he was in town and wanted to see her and she blocked him. But after that she started to distance herself and be more cold. And one day when we we're going around a mall and sat down for coffee, she suddenly wanted to break up again, saying she wanted to go back to him, she didnt know why but she just wanted his presence and kept on saying how terrible she felt for doing this to me and how terrible of a person she felt like. I had a panic attack from the amount of crying and stress I was going through, she came with me to the metro station and we departed ways there. Tomorrow we had a meet up with our friend group and she also came to the meet up, I knew where she was coming from, she was with her ex before coming to the meet up spot, that was what I theorized in my mind at least. During the meet up I was genuinely just sad and couldnt even muster up the energy to say anything. Our friends also knew what had happened and one of our mutual close friends was acting cold towards her, she must have felt that and she got up from the table to leave, I went next to her to ask if she needed company on the road and she held my face and hugged me, then said ''It's okay I'm going to see my friend, he is waiting for me'' at that moment my heart dropped because what I thought I was just making up in my mind was true, she really did go to see him. At school she would come and talk to me, ask how I was and tell me about him for some reason, she also kept doing physically intimate things to me aswell like hugging me or smelling me even. She was dumping the problems she was already having with him onto me by venting to me. She apperantely also learned that he cheated on her during their relationship. One day, about 4 days after our break up, the guy sent her a very intimidating and genuinely concerning picture and she got scared and talked to me about it, I asked her to stop talking with him and just think about herself for a moment. She started crying and begging me, apologising, asking for me to forgive her. I still loved her and genuinely wanted to protect her so I did forgive her, and from this point on things just got worse. 



After our talk we got out of school to somewhere else and on the way she asked what other people talked about her after our break up and our mutual close friend was by my side the entire time, comforted me for hours and genuinely helped me so much, but he had pretty mean things to say about her in text. And I, being the dumbass, gave her my phone and she saw those texts and got mad at me for not ''saying anything back'' and they stopped talking after that exchange, also our friend called me and just said that he was dissapointed in me and felt betrayed that I'd show those messages, I genuinely felt bad but It was an in the moment slip up for me. A week after that, my ex gave me an ultimatum, either I'd stop talking to our friend or she would leave and me being the dumbass again, stopped talking to our friend. After that our friend group kind of fell apart. A few months later when things started to smooth out again, her ex texted her for her birthday and she blocked him once again (He would keep changing numbers and find different platforms to text her). She seemed fine this time though and I genuinely felt relief that she didnt get effected by this, but after a few days we had a little fight (We had never ever fighted in our relationship before, this was the one and only) I deescalated the situation and thought everything was fine. 



But in the following days she confessed that after our fight she apperantely unblocked her ex and texted him saying thank you for wishing her a birthday. The moment she said that my anger and sadness was at an all time high but I didnt want to explode on her and just said I was really dissapointed with her. That somehow got sweeped under the rug and after a few more weeks she started making more fights and started being annoyed at every little thing I did, even things that she never had a problem with before and things she even liked. One day she suddenly said ''I feel terrible about the things I did to you, I cannot live with myself, but I also have questions that I need answers to from him, I want to know why he didn't fight for us but I need to make a choice between you and him'' I was trying to talk to her but she kept trying to go so I held her arm and asked her to just wait for a moment, for some reason this triggered her immensely and she started acting very scared, almost as if I was trying to harm her somehow. I said to her that we should just talk when she gets home because with things like this, it looks like another break up. She never texted back, and the day after when I asked her to give me an explanation and proper talk, she refused to saying that ''My therapist said I dont have to talk if it makes me uncomfortable'' 



during this break up period we met up and talked a few more times aswell, It was even valentines day where I thought we made up and even went on a date with her, but the day after she just left again, said she regretted our meet ups. It was around 2 weeks later that she called me and said she wanted to meet up, I was going to call her aswell to finally say her a final goodbye and not talk to her again but when I heard her call first, I couldn't hold myself. In our meet up we talked a lot about where everything went wrong and how she was mentally not well, and her decisions we're a result of that. She finally stopped talking with that guy once and for all and we got back together again. I definetly have issues too but I loved her and didnt want to let her go, I thought that maybe if I helped her get through this trauma she would finally heal, because most of her problems are because of that guy. 



Our relationship seemed better than ever for the next 4 or 5 months, no small problems, no ex's, no fights, just us and us trying to heal. Some family friends came to visit them one weekend and one of those people was an artist that seemed interested in her work, she is also an artist. She told me about her exchange and talks with the guy saying she looked up to him in a way. I thought it was pretty weird and felt alarms going in my head about that guy, I knew something was fishy about him so I asked her to not talk with him again and she accepted it. She would keep whining about not having friends or missed having a friend group so she got kind of irritated when I asked her to not talk with that guy (Who is 5 years older than her, just like her ex) One day she was having a bad day and told me that she would never leave me, that in a world where everyone just gives up on each other she would never let me go. She did sometimes say things like this but it felt more genuine than ever, especially after all that drama we went through. So I felt really good that she was motivated. But after a few days later she suddenly wanted to leave me, saying that she no longer felt comfortable with me and she did not want any relationship again and gave me no further explanation. 



A day later I saw her post a story with that guy on a date and my world crumbled. I was more heart broken than ever because although the previous stuff was still bad, I saw it as a stepping stone to getting better, but this was a choice, a decision she for some reason made to leave me for a guy she barely even knew. A week later she texted me trying to give me an explanation and saying how ''she didnt cheat on me'' I tried to end on a good note but everything had been bottled up in me for so long that I just sent her a long and angry paragraph just saying how betrayed I felt after all the work we put into this relationship and she responded to me in anger, trying to act as if she was the victim and that I wasnt seeing her pain somehow? After that exchange we had one more talk where she said she didnt actually like the new guy and she couldnt forget about me and that she wanted me but she didnt know what to do, then immediately switched up a few hours later saying she never wanted to see me again and blocked me. We did not talk again for 3 months. In those 3 months I genuinely tried to heal to my best and got way better, even started dating again. 



But one day she messaged me saying if i wanted to talk. Although I was healing, a part of me still ached to be with her for some reason, so I let her talk with me again. She told me how terrible that new guy was and how she felt really bad in general about what she did to me, she knew she acted childish and apologised for everything. After a few meet ups and talks we got back together again. This time it didnt last because I realised I no longer felt love for her, It was just rage and emptiness that I felt. I felt disgusted, I had panic attacks every night just because of the suffocation from the fear of everything that might happen again. I wanted to give her a chance but every chance I gave her I once again saw that she was still the unkind, impatient, untrustworthy and chaotic person that refused to grow. And I knew what I had to do, I had to end the cycle myself, because it would repeat again if i didnt do it myself. So I broke up with her saying I didnt feel comfortable with her and our history anymore, and that I just lived in fear. With every ounce of my being, I wanted her to say something that would change my mind, I wanted her to fight for the relationship, beg for me to not leave like i did for her all those times. But she didnt even bother, instead she got mad, refused to talk and acted immaturely once again and blocked me. She texted me again one time saying ''I dont understand why you left me still, I feel angry. I dont know why everyone has a problem with me either. Did you just want to show me how it felt to leave someone suddenly, we're you the kind of person to do bad things to those who did you bad'' 



I sent her a long paragraph venting, but It didnt even matter because she had already blocked me without even waiting for an answer. I loved for the first time and I gave it my all, I truly wanted her to change and to be her best but I guess sometimes even the whole world isn't enough to change some things. It's been a while and Im pretty happy right now, I made up with my friends and got back the friend group together. I still see her at school but we didnt come face to face yet. I dont know if she will try to talk to me again in the future, or maybe even try to get back together, what do you think?

Tomorrow we had a meet up with our friend group and she also came to the meet up, I knew where she was coming from, she was with her ex before coming to the meet up spot, that was what I theorized in my mind at least. During the meet up I was genuinely just sad and couldnt even muster up the energy to say anything. Our friends also knew what had happened and one of our mutual close friends was acting cold towards her, she must have felt that and she got up from the table to leave, I went next to her to ask if she needed company on the road and she held my face and hugged me, then said ''It's okay I'm going to see my friend, he is waiting for me'' at that moment my heart dropped because what I thought I was just making up in my mind was true, she really did go to see him. At school she would come and talk to me, ask how I was and tell me about him for some reason, she also kept doing physically intimate things to me aswell like hugging me or smelling me even. She was dumping the problems she was already having with him onto me by venting to me. She apperantely also learned that he cheated on her during their relationship. One day, about 4 days after our break up, the guy sent her a very intimidating and genuinely concerning picture and she got scared and talked to me about it, I asked her to stop talking with him and just think about herself for a moment. She started crying and begging me, apologising, asking for me to forgive her. I still loved her and genuinely wanted to protect her so I did forgive her, and from this point on things just got worse.

After our talk we got out of school to somewhere else and on the way she asked what other people talked about her after our break up and our mutual close friend was by my side the entire time, comforted me for hours and genuinely helped me so much, but he had pretty mean things to say about her in text. And I, being the dumbass, gave her my phone and she saw those texts and got mad at me for not ''saying anything back'' and they stopped talking after that exchange, also our friend called me and just said that he was dissapointed in me and felt betrayed that I'd show those messages, I genuinely felt bad but It was an in the moment slip up for me. A week after that, my ex gave me an ultimatum, either I'd stop talking to our friend or she would leave and me being the dumbass again, stopped talking to our friend. After that our friend group kind of fell apart. A few months later when things started to smooth out again, her ex texted her for her birthday and she blocked him once again (He would keep changing numbers and find different platforms to text her). She seemed fine this time though and I genuinely felt relief that she didnt get effected by this, but after a few days we had a little fight (We had never ever fighted in our relationship before, this was the one and only) I deescalated the situation and thought everything was fine.

But in the following days she confessed that after our fight she apperantely unblocked her ex and texted him saying thank you for wishing her a birthday. The moment she said that my anger and sadness was at an all time high but I didnt want to explode on her and just said I was really dissapointed with her. That somehow got sweeped under the rug and after a few more weeks she started making more fights and started being annoyed at every little thing I did, even things that she never had a problem with before and things she even liked. One day she suddenly said ''I feel terrible about the things I did to you, I cannot live with myself, but I also have questions that I need answers to from him, I want to know why he didn't fight for us but I need to make a choice between you and him'' I was trying to talk to her but she kept trying to go so I held her arm and asked her to just wait for a moment, for some reason this triggered her immensely and she started acting very scared, almost as if I was trying to harm her somehow. I said to her that we should just talk when she gets home because with things like this, it looks like another break up. She never texted back, and the day after when I asked her to give me an explanation and proper talk, she refused to saying that ''My therapist said I dont have to talk if it makes me uncomfortable''

during this break up period we met up and talked a few more times aswell, It was even valentines day where I thought we made up and even went on a date with her, but the day after she just left again, said she regretted our meet ups. It was around 2 weeks later that she called me and said she wanted to meet up, I was going to call her aswell to finally say her a final goodbye and not talk to her again but when I heard her call first, I couldn't hold myself. In our meet up we talked a lot about where everything went wrong and how she was mentally not well, and her decisions we're a result of that. She finally stopped talking with that guy once and for all and we got back together again. I definetly have issues too but I loved her and didnt want to let her go, I thought that maybe if I helped her get through this trauma she would finally heal, because most of her problems are because of that guy.

Our relationship seemed better than ever for the next 4 or 5 months, no small problems, no ex's, no fights, just us and us trying to heal. Some family friends came to visit them one weekend and one of those people was an artist that seemed interested in her work, she is also an artist. She told me about her exchange and talks with the guy saying she looked up to him in a way. I thought it was pretty weird and felt alarms going in my head about that guy, I knew something was fishy about him so I asked her to not talk with him again and she accepted it. She would keep whining about not having friends or missed having a friend group so she got kind of irritated when I asked her to not talk with that guy (Who is 5 years older than her, just like her ex) One day she was having a bad day and told me that she would never leave me, that in a world where everyone just gives up on each other she would never let me go. She did sometimes say things like this but it felt more genuine than ever, especially after all that drama we went through. So I felt really good that she was motivated. But after a few days later she suddenly wanted to leave me, saying that she no longer felt comfortable with me and she did not want any relationship again and gave me no further explanation.

A day later I saw her post a story with that guy on a date and my world crumbled. I was more heart broken than ever because although the previous stuff was still bad, I saw it as a stepping stone to getting better, but this was a choice, a decision she for some reason made to leave me for a guy she barely even knew. A week later she texted me trying to give me an explanation and saying how ''she didnt cheat on me'' I tried to end on a good note but everything had been bottled up in me for so long that I just sent her a long and angry paragraph just saying how betrayed I felt after all the work we put into this relationship and she responded to me in anger, trying to act as if she was the victim and that I wasnt seeing her pain somehow? After that exchange we had one more talk where she said she didnt actually like the new guy and she couldnt forget about me and that she wanted me but she didnt know what to do, then immediately switched up a few hours later saying she never wanted to see me again and blocked me. We did not talk again for 3 months. In those 3 months I genuinely tried to heal to my best and got way better, even started dating again.

But one day she messaged me saying if i wanted to talk. Although I was healing, a part of me still ached to be with her for some reason, so I let her talk with me again. She told me how terrible that new guy was and how she felt really bad in general about what she did to me, she knew she acted childish and apologised for everything. After a few meet ups and talks we got back together again. This time it didnt last because I realised I no longer felt love for her, It was just rage and emptiness that I felt. I felt disgusted, I had panic attacks every night just because of the suffocation from the fear of everything that might happen again. I wanted to give her a chance but every chance I gave her I once again saw that she was still the unkind, impatient, untrustworthy and chaotic person that refused to grow. And I knew what I had to do, I had to end the cycle myself, because it would repeat again if i didnt do it myself. So I broke up with her saying I didnt feel comfortable with her and our history anymore, and that I just lived in fear. With every ounce of my being, I wanted her to say something that would change my mind, I wanted her to fight for the relationship, beg for me to not leave like i did for her all those times. But she didnt even bother, instead she got mad, refused to talk and acted immaturely once again and blocked me. She texted me again one time saying ''I dont understand why you left me still, I feel angry. I dont know why everyone has a problem with me either. Did you just want to show me how it felt to leave someone suddenly, we're you the kind of person to do bad things to those who did you bad''

I sent her a long paragraph venting, but It didnt even matter because she had already blocked me without even waiting for an answer. I loved for the first time and I gave it my all, I truly wanted her to change and to be her best but I guess sometimes even the whole world isn't enough to change some things. It's been a while and Im pretty happy right now, I made up with my friends and got back the friend group together. I still see her at school but we didnt come face to face yet. I dont know if she will try to talk to me again in the future, or maybe even try to get back together, what do you think? (I learned my lesson dont worry)",2,1759792969.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1nzyt99,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1nzyt99/my_gut_was_a_mess_i_was_stressed_tired_and_foggy/,"My gut was a mess. I was stressed, tired, and foggy. I tried everything until I learned about the ""second brain"" in my gut and how to actually talk to it.","Hey everyone,

For years, I felt like crap. And I mean that in the most literal sense. My digestion was all over the place, my energy was in the toilet (pun intended), and my anxiety and brain fog were so bad I felt like I was watching my own life through a foggy window. I‚Äôd given up.

Then I fell down a rabbit hole of research for a project and had my mind completely blown. I found out our guts are literally lined with over 100 million neurons‚Äîas many as a cat's brain. It‚Äôs called the enteric nervous system, and it‚Äôs in constant, two-way communication with our actual brain.

This gut-brain chat isn't just about telling you when you're hungry. The bacteria in your gut produce a huge amount of the body's serotonin and dopamine. When your gut microbiome is out of whack, this chemical production gets messed up, directly impacting your mood, sleep, and even your motivation. Stanford researchers found that gut microbes can influence the desire to exercise by triggering dopamine release in the brain. Let that sink in.

The ""Aha!"" moment for me was realizing I wasn't just stressed; my body was physically inflamed and out of balance. The science is clear: an unhappy gut can lead to everything from mood swings and fatigue to more serious long-term risks.

So, I decided to stop just worrying about my health and start hacking my gut-brain axis. I'm not a doctor, but here‚Äôs what I did that literally changed my life. This isn't another ""eat more yogurt"" list.

1. I Became a Fiber Farmer (Not a Cowboy)
I stopped focusing on cutting things out and startedadding food for my gut bugs. The goal is to eat for a diverse microbiome, not just a ""clean"" diet. I loaded up on fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut) for the good bacteria themselves, and colorful plants (fruits, veggies, oats, legumes) as prebiotic fiber to feed them. The fiber is what makes the good bacteria thrive.

2. I Embraced the Power of the Phenol
This one sounds weird but stick with me.I started paying attention to phenols‚Äîcompounds found in coffee, dark chocolate, and colorful berries. A huge 2024 study in Nature Microbiology found that coffee (even decaf!) has one of the strongest positive effects on gut microbiome composition of any food or drink. It boosts a specific beneficial bacterium. So, my morning cup of joe is now a deliberate part of my gut-health protocol.

3. I Prioritized Sleep Like My Sanity Depended on It (Because It Does)
The gut-brain axis is a two-way street.A troubled brain sends signals to the gut, and vice-versa. Research shows that just two nights of poor sleep can throw your gut microbiome out of balance, increasing inflammation. I made 7-8 hours non-negotiable. To protect my sleep, I switch to decaf after 2 PM.

4. I Moved My Body to Move My Gut
This isn't about getting ripped.Cardio exercise increases oxygen in the bloodstream, which helps good gut bacteria flourish. It also helps fight inflammation and, crucially, speeds up digestion, which keeps everything moving smoothly. Even a daily 30-minute walk made a noticeable difference in my bloating and energy levels.

The Result?
It didn't happen overnight,but within a few weeks, the ""fog"" lifted. I have more energy, my anxiety is manageable, and I finally feel in control. My gut is no longer the enemy; it's my partner.

This isn't just my story. The science is exploding. Researchers are now finding that a lot of what we thought started in the brain‚Äîfrom Parkinson's to Long COVID cognitive issues‚Äîmay actually have origins in the gut.

TL;DR: Your gut has its own nervous system and talks to your brain all day. By feeding it fermented foods and fiber, prioritizing sleep, and moving daily, you can hack this connection to improve your mood, energy, and focus.

He was standing in the room and told he is not moving out and I can call police if I want to and if I want the record for him. I asked him to get out of the room. He didn't move. Then I said I am getting out of the room. Then he got out of the room. 
I woke up in the middle of the night from a lot of noise downstairs. And then fall asleep again. 
In the morning he brought coffee and started complaining why I wanted to call police. I told he should watch his hands. He said you yelled at me, this why I pushed you. I responded it doesn't matter, you should watch your hands. Then he said who is going to bring you coffee if you call police. 
When I came downstairs I saw that he clean up all of the mess from kids playing. I usually clean it up myself and complain a lot that I have to. It looked like he was cleaning up at night when I woke up from noise.
I also told him he should find therapist. He usually saying he will never go but this time he was silent.

Full transcript:

I don't have a very high opinion of people. I think people are boring and stupid and generally speaking out of their mind. Yeah. Not you, of course. You are special. You are unique and interesting. I'm talking about everybody else. Everybody else.  
  
People are so boring. So boring. And let me give you a public service announcement here. Never tell other people your dreams. Never tell them your dreams. Like nobody cares about your dreams. Nobody. It doesn't matter like how crazy the plot twist is at the end, how vivid the dream was, we don't care. In fact, humanity as a whole cares so little about your dreams that there is an entire branch of science dedicated to listening to your dreams for a fee. There's people making a living out of allowing you to sit down and tell them your dreams because nobody else wants to listen to them. That's how little we care. Do yourself a favor. If you have a dream, just get a diary. Don't share it in public. Nobody cares.  
  
I had a friend in college who told us her dreams. She would sit on the table at the cafeteria. *Do you want me to tell you what I what I dream last night? It was so crazy.* And people, we already knew her plan cuz it wasn't the first time. So people would be like, *Mhhhhm....* And so a few minutes later, like seeing how lukewarm the audience was, she would try again. *You're not going to believe the dream I had last night. Mhm. Mhm.* But eventually she couldn't hold it in.

She had to just... She had like verbal gonorrhea. She had to just let it all out. And she was like, *Well, I was in this super long hallway. It kind of looked like a hallway, but it could have been also like the subway station. I'm not sure. And there was people, but I couldn't see their faces. Like no matter how close I got to them, I couldn't see their faces. And then at the end, like all the way to the other side, there was a house. And I think it was my grandmother's house, but it could also have been like my aunt's house cuz they're very similar. But maybe it was my grandma's because the ceiling.*

Oh my god. Oh my god. And so what happened was as this woman made a habit of telling us her dreams, people started to anticipate her arrival. So whenever we saw her car approaching or like her walking towards us, people started to clear the table like, *Oh my god, oh my god, I think it's so late. I have class.* And everybody started leaving except for me. Except for me. I didn't notice this pattern. You know that I was always like the last person sitting with this woman and always listening to her stupid dreams. I didn't notice. You want to know why? I'll tell you why. Because I didn't notice she was particularly boring. To me, to me, she was just as boring as everybody else. I saw no difference.

No difference between her telling me her dreams and other friends telling me like the crazy story of what happened to them last night or the other idiot at the table telling me for time number 16 how *oh my god I can't function without coffee I have to go get my coffee oh my god isn't coffee great I can't I can't do anything unless I have my cup of coffee* to me they they're all the same they're all at the same level of boredom but apparently and this is something that shocked me these boring gray beige people, they have standards too for boredom. I didn't have a clue. And I realized because I eavesdropped on a conversation between two other people who were badmouthing the dream girl behind her back, saying how bored they were of her stories.

And so that got me thinking, you know, people in general are virtuosos of boredom. They are they are so used to boring things like being boring, being around boring people that they have like 20 different words for boredom like like like Eskimos with snow. You know what I mean? Like when you go when when it snows, all you see is snow. But but an Eskimo is so used to snow that they kind of they have 20 different words for snow. And to me, this is the same thing. That's the same thing. You know, I had another friend telling me like one of the friends that were badmouthing her was like, *Last night was so crazy. We went to this pub and it was full of people. I think there were like 150 people, but it could have been 200 really. Uh cuz we were looking for a table but we couldn't find one because it was so full of people. Come to think of it. Maybe it was more close to like 180. You know the occupiency of this place is probably higher. Anyway, we were waiting for a table and then this guy comes out and he was wearing a leather jacket and you know what? I think it was 150 people.*

I mean to me it's the same thing. It's the same damn thing. Like I don't care. I don't care what happened to you last night. Nothing fun or interesting could have happened to you last night. Going to the same place everybody else goes to in the company of the same boring beige people that you hang out with. Talking about the same subjects that you usually talk about. There's nothing fun that could possibly come out of that equation. So spare me the agony. So to me, they're all the same. They're equally boring. Equally boring.

Man... the topics of conversation. *What about the game last night? My pet is my child. Uh, adulting so hard. Tinder bios. Such a scam. Um, the weather, crazy, crazy, crazy weather*. You know, there's like five or six of these and they're in constant rotation. Constant rotation. You see the same group of people every day and they're going to talk to you about the same things every day over and over and and you're like *we already talked about this last time, didn't we? I've already said what I think about this. Do I need me do do I have to repeat it? Should I reword it a little so it's not so eerily similar?* I don't know what is expected of me in this situation.

And the truth is I have realized with boring people they actually enjoy talking about the same things because it's not a real conversation. Think about it. It's not a real conversation. There's no exchange of information happening. It's just like everybody's scratching each other's back like *you belong!*. *You belong! You belong! You belong!* And they think *I belong.* *Yes*! *you belong dear*. You know they're all talking about the same things. They all know what each other's opinions about the subject is. In fact, they choose the same topics because they know what everyone else has to say about it. They know there's not going to be any friction. They know it's going to be frictionless and smooth sailing and absolutely boring. And that's exactly what they want. That's exactly how they like it.

I came to the conclusion after a lot of pondering that they probably receive a manual like a secret manual that they all have read. It's organized alphabetically and it has all the topics of conversation that you could possibly use in public like in social settings. The Boring Manual, by the way, the Boring Manual, I'm convinced they have it. It's not just a metaphor. I think they have it and it's a secret manual and they get it from the boring office and it's it's it's leather bound and in beige. It goes with everything haha and it lists all the things that you can possibly talk about, but it also lists like the possible opinions you can have about it. They'll have like a *for* opinion and an *against* opinion and then a couple more reasonable opinions, *centrist* opinions. So you can mix and match and build your own personality out of that. It's great.

It also it's updated every couple of years. You know, every couple of years they come up with a new boring manual and they have a very big distribution, but for some reason some people don't receive it. Some people don't get the newest boring manual. It's kind of like when you get a new operative system update and everybody updates it, but you're still like using Snow Leopard from like 2015. You're not up to date with uh the latest apps. Well, this is the same thing.

Like some people are stuck in the past and they keep repeating topics of conversation that were maybe allowed in the past like two editions ago. But they're definitely out for this edition. And they didn't get the memo. And this is when people people start looking old and obsolete. And so they're still talking to you about like shoes. *Can't help myself. I can't help myself. It doesn't matter if I'm like on a diet of ramen. If I see a pair of cute shoes, I just have to buy them. Half of my shoes don't even go with anything I wear. I don't care. I love them. I think they're beautiful little sculptures that I can keep in my closet.* And I I kept thinking like *you you're still in Snow Leopard. Please please get your software update. Please you're making a fool out of yourself.*

I never got a copy of the manual. You know, to me to me it's it's it's very puzzling, confusing at times cuz I never got that manual. Any nobody gave it to me. I don't know if they hand it out at some sort of beige people office that they go to. But I do know and I have noticed that they are all very much synchronized because I'm the person who's always bringing up new subjects to conversations and it doesn't always work very well with boring people, you know, because when I bring up a new subject, I have realized there's like two different reactions. Like the first one is it does not register. I swear I'm not making this up. Do the test. Approach a group of people that you're familiar with and hit them with something completely out of left field. Completely out of left field. Like start talking to them about black holes. *What do you feel about black holes? Do you think black holes are real? Do do you think do you are you afraid that black hole is going to eat like swallow you up while you're sleeping one night? Nobody saw it coming. It's just swallowed everybody.* you know, throw them something like something interesting, something thought-provoking, something unexpected, and you'll see they'll just not register. They will maybe laugh. *You're so funny* and then continue to talk about the Super Bowl. My dog is my baby. You know.

The second thing is uh they get mad. They get mad. they give you a backhanded compliment or maybe they or maybe they also just straight up tell you something offensive because you're testing them and they don't like that you're testing them. They don't have they didn't have an opinion in the manual for this. Now you're forcing them to come up with something and what if it's not the right thing to say? You know what if this is going to be give them like a social hit? They don't want to do a faux pas in front of all of their friends. What are they going to say to this? You're putting them in a tight spot. So, you are the problem. And throughout the years, I have realized that it is a mark of being well bred. So, it's a mark of class to be a little bit irreverent in front of other people.

And so these people these people uh I have come to the realization that there is like they have like an antenna somewhere and they synchronize with one another. They synchronize each other which is very important to them. They get synchronized. How how do they get synchronized? Well, they get synchronized by doing things like at the same time. kind of like I don't know if you know this but when you have two metronomes and you put them in the same table and they start like they start like at a different rate like they're like completely different but after a while they synchronize and they start going exactly the same these people are the same and that is why in Japan they make them do exercises in the morning and in the the offices like the salary men they go to the roof of the building and they do some exercises all together. It's very uncanny. They're all like doing the same thing together. And I'm convinced that is not just that is not just a random thing. I think they're getting their workers synchronized. And that is what these people do.

That is why they all hear the same music. They all wear the same clothes. They all watch the same shows because they have to get synchronized. And once you get them synchronized, then you can control them so easily. Piece of cake. So easy to control. All you have to give them is like an opinion that feels like it would be approved by the rest and then they will follow. It doesn't matter where you take them next. You know, this is why I have an issue with people who say that AI uh AI is going to take over the world and they are going to eventually like re rebel and like murder us. They're going to destroy mankind. You know, *robots are going to take over the world, are going to destroy mankind. You have to be careful*. And that's my problem. My problem is robots have already taken over mankind. They have already murdered us. They're all around you. All these people, they're robots. They're human robots. It's what what does it matter if like they're wearing like a human suit or they're made out of like computer parts? They're the same. They are not They are not They're not people. like they're not actual real people. They don't have like there's nothing in there. Nothing in there. That's why they're all so stupid and out of their minds.

You see, when you talk to one of these people and you manage to get them to unsync, get them disynchronized and you're talking to them one-on-one, they're wonderful people, delightful. They're nice and kind and interesting and maybe they have ideas of their own. You know, maybe they do, maybe they have ideas of their own. It's when they're with others, when they become a cluster of people that they turn into robots and then there's like no arguing and you start see you see them do crazy stuff. Like you see them do stupid stupid things. You see them do the stupidest things and you're like, ""This is stupid, but you're smart. I've talked to you in person. I know you're not stupid. So what is going on?"" And that's when you have to realize like they are either out of their minds or they are full of shit.

And that's the main issue. The main issue is that they sacrifice whatever it is that they have inside for conformity. And this is what's killing everything around us. That's what's killing all of the human experience is this drive for conformity. You know how, for example, someone buys an apartment and it's their apartment, but they don't dare to decorate it in the way that would actually please them because they are thinking of reselling potential, like reselling value. Maybe when I want to sell this apartment 20 years in the future, the person who wants to buy it does not like a green kitchen. So, let's make it gray. Let's make the entire house different shades of gray. That for sure is not going to offend anybody. You know, gray, everybody likes gray or doesn't like gray, but you know, it's very, it's a centrist color. You know, it's a centrist color. It's not going to offend anybody. Nobody's going to have a problem with a gray kitchen. Now, you can extend this to like all areas of life. And then you have like the modern man's life. It's a life for conformity.

And you can't even blame them. You can't even blame them because I feel like I feel like weak men, they have to be, not only do they have to be in the center of the pack, they also want the pack to be kind of ruthless to anyone who does not belong to the pack. And that's because they're weak. You know, they don't have they don't trust that they can survive independently unless they have the protection of the herd. I feel like that's there's like there's like a component of cowardice in the mix, but also weak men, you know are the people pushing for conformity in every every area, you know, every area of society.

And that's how we get something that is it's like a funnel, you know, it's like a funnel. Like you you have the funnel and you know, you put in all kinds of things that they all fit into this big the big mouth of the funnel. You put in people with different like ideas and and tastes and dreams and fears and all of that, but it all gets like it all gets constrained and turned into slop, you know, like turned into like if it doesn't go through like this super narrow neck it doesn't fly. We have to get rid we have to polish and we have to remove anything and everything that makes something unique. And what happens is we end up with this slop, this gray existence, this beige colored people, beige color music, beige color movies, beige colored TV shows, beige color clothing. Everything is in tones of grays and beige. And it makes for a very boring existence.

So yeah, I have I have a problem with people. I don't really like people very much. And it's not about people themselves. Like I said, like individuals are fine. I mean there's stupid people and smart people and there's like people who are sober and people who are out of their minds but in general at least if you take them one by one you can kind of see a spark of something else lurking under the surface but put them in a group and just even like pairs you know even like pairs of people and you're already going for averages and like medians and slop and they are aggressive too

Be very careful if you're someone different from the rest. Be very careful if you cherish your own differences, if you don't try to mask them. And don't think they're harmless just because they're weak because their strength is in the numbers. Their strength is in the numbers. And they know this. So, if you're someone unique and if you don't care for their stuff and you're outside of the herd, be very, very careful because they're going to make sure they're going to make sure the stampede passes right over your head cuz you're a threat. You see, you're a threat of that which is possible. That which is possible and they're falling short. So, yeah, I'm not a fan of not a fan of people. I'm not a fan of crowds, but even just like two people, three people in a table, makes you shiver, doesn't it? Yeah. I don't know. Anyway, if you uh Yeah, if you're new to this place, and you probably are cuz let's face it, I have a very small audience of people. There's like five of us and a dog. uh know that I am doing a project. I am going to be uploading one video every day for the next I think 340 something in one year. 365 days. 365 videos. This is like video number 10 or something. And yeah, I'm pretty excited. I don't know where this is going to take me. I hope somewhere um I hope somewhere.

# Morning Protocol: Just Another 130-Year-Old

Woke up this morning feeling‚Ä¶ 45. Thanks to my personalized cellular nanobot regimen‚Äîa direct descendant of the gene-editing b[reakthroughs of the 2030s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNrSNgF81Q8&t=1s)‚Äîmy chronological age is just a number. It‚Äôs hard to imagine the era before the Great Longevity Dividend (c. 2060), when a human life was over by 100.

I started my day with a full diagnostic from my Bio-Twin, a quantum-enhanced digital model of my physiology. The prediction: a minor epigenetic drift in my circulatory system. My Twin immediately ordered a targeted, micro-RNA adjustment from the home bioreactor, which I'll absorb with my coffee. No more blind, general medicine‚Äîit‚Äôs all hyper-personalized, preventative, and predictive, powered by the convergence of AI and biotechnology that first started to accelerate around the 2040s.

After my health check, I had a meeting with an off-world colleague. We didn't use a screen. Instead, I put on my Extended Reality (XR) lenses, and my office wall dissolved to show a perfect, 3D holographic rendering of her Mars habitat. She was standing there, the rusty red landscape outside the transparent dome. Tele-immersion technology is so advanced now, a relic of the 2020s-era ""metaverse"" concept that became a fully integrated reality.

My career? I'm an ""Ecological Memory Curator."" The AI and robotic process automation (RPA) systems of the mid-21st century have taken over most rote labor (and yes, that meant we finally adopted a global Universal Basic Income model). My job is entirely creative and ethical: interpreting and restoring the pre-climate-crisis ecological data for the new, resilient ecosystems we've engineered. It's meaningful work, and thanks to cellular repair and bio-printed organs (a capability mastered around 2050), I fully expect to still be at it in 2180. The future is long, and life is vibrant.

So lets do a little light hearted play‚Ä¶ to see which of your inner senses are stronger than others‚Ä¶ 

\*\*

To play - you will need to close your eyes, take a few breathes and try each one.¬†

**Hearing** : hear the sound of ambulance or police siren ‚Ä¶¬† Hear the sound of a waterfall - Hear the sound of the birds chirping outside - Hear the Sound of your best friend saying ""OMG OMG OMG"". (Thats inner conversation)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

**Taste** : imagine biting into a lemon or something that‚Äôs really really sour taste it in your mouth - or better yet imagine that you‚Äôre standing in the middle of a supermarket in front of the chips (crisps ) aisle and you‚Äôre trying to choose which chips you want and you imagine what they taste like in your mouth before choosing one. taste the salt and vinegar chips in your mouth. Now try licking money in your imagination.. What does it taste like?¬† ¬† This is an UNDERRATED Sense.

**Touch** \- imagine running your hand along cold ice. Maybe you‚Äôve got an ice block in your hand and you can feel how wet and cold it is.¬† ¬† Pat a fluffy cat in your imagination. ¬† ¬† Run your hand along some gravel in your imagination.¬†¬†

**Smell** \- you have just walked into a local cafe and you can smell the coffee that is brewing. Or maybe you are in the bathroom and they‚Äôve just cleaned it with disinfectant. ¬† Can you smell it?¬† ¬† Maybe your partner is cooking your favourite meal, you walk over the stove, lean over to the food thats cooking and you take a big whiff.¬†

**Sight** \- imagine a coin in your hand, zoom in and look at all the details on the coin in your hand. ¬† There's a red bull can sitting on a bench - zoom in - look at the can, what size is it, is it open?¬† Does it have condensation on the side?¬† ¬† Imagine a rose - zoom in - look at the petals‚Ä¶ ¬† how clear is it.¬† ¬† Try it with eyes open or closed.. ¬† Test all these.. ¬† Try for yourself which one of your inner senses are stronger than the others. ¬† Don't just let the internet tell you what you should do.

1nzydea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Freefood/comments/1nzydea/complete_guide_to_earning_free_food_from/,Complete Guide to Earning Free Food from McDonalds Monopoly,"Hello! Mods, I hope this post is allowed since the process for earning free food from McDonalds Monopoly can be a bit cumbersome. (Just look at the other threads, there are a ton of confused people in the comments.) Hopefully this will cut down on the number of people asking questions.

Note: I'm not associated with McDonalds, I just spent an hour sifting through the official rules and figured I'd share.

---

**What is this?**

---

McDonalds has an annual promotion where they partner with Monopoly to give away tons of prizes such as free food, gift cards, and a handful of grand prizes such as cars, airline miles, etc. Typically you buy food at McDonalds and receive a code (from a game piece) which can be entered online for a chance at a prize. However, sweepstakes in the United States are required by law to have a free method of entry.

For most sweepstakes, you can only enter for free once, or some other limited amount of times. For this year's McDonalds contest, you can enter for free **the exact same amount of times** as if you purchased food from McDonalds. That's right. **There's no advantage to purchasing food versus entering for free.** This is because there is a maximum number of game pieces you can redeem each day (10), and you can get 10 game pieces for free each day through the method below.

**Note: This contest is only open to folks in the United States.**

---

**How can I get and redeem free game pieces?**

---

1. First make sure you have downloaded the McDonalds app and made an account. It is required to participate in this promotion.
2. Go to this link: https://amoe.playatmcd.com/
3. Enter your email, confirm you are 18 years or older, security verification, and read the rules confirmation. Click Continue to Verification.
4. Wait 5-15 minutes to receive an email from McDonalds. It's not an instant email. If you're still waiting after 20 minutes, try entering a different email in the form.
5. When this email arrives, click on the link in the email and type in the six-digit code from the email. Then enter your name and street address and tap Validate My Address. Finally, tap Submit Game Code Request. *Note: If you get an error in the form, make sure your suffix is chosen (if you have none, you have to choose None from the dropdown).*
6. After submitting the form McDonalds should send you a new email in 1-15 minutes. This email typically arrives quicker than the previous email, but may still take some time.
7. Open the McDonalds app. At the top there should be a Monopoly section with two buttons. Tap on the white button that says ""Register or Play.""
8. Tap ""Add Code.""
9. Tap ""Add Code Manually"" at the bottom.
10. Copy/paste or type in a 12-digit code from the email and tap ""Submit Code.""

Now just sit back and see if you won something.

---

**I didn't win anything :(**

---

Don't fret. **Most people will get nothing.** There is only about a 19% chance you will win a food prize. This breaks down as follows:

- Choice of Apple Pie OR Small Fries (~4% chance)
- Choice of Vanilla Cone OR Small Fries (3.12%)
- Choice of Biscuit Breakfast Sandwich (2.63%)
- Choice of McChicken OR Double Cheeseburger (2.38%)
- Choice of Small Soft Drink OR Coffee (2.17%)
- Choice of 4pc McNuggets/Snack Wrap (2.04%)
- Choice of Small Frappe OR Small Shake OR Small Smoothie (1.47%)
- Choice of 2 Cookies OR Mini McFlurry (1.02%)

There is also a less than 1% chance you will win McDonalds points ranging from 1,500 up to 6,000 points.

Conversely, there is about an 80% chance you will not earn a food or points prize. Instead, you will most likely receive a Collect to Win game piece. These are the massive prizes likes cars, motorhomes, shopping sprees, etc. You have to collect **multiple** of these game pieces and the odds of doing that are astronomically small (ie. more likely to be struck by lightning). So it's basically the same as receiving nothing, unless you are incredibly lucky.

---

**But wait, there's more!**

---

Scroll down and tap on ""Play Now"" under Bonus Play. A free prize is given at a random interval every minute. If you happen to tap at the predetermined time, you will get one of the following:

- One of the food or points prizes listed above
- A gift card to a variety of stores including Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, Ulta Beauty, Best Buy, Fanatics, New Era, Lowe's, etc
- A physical prize from a variety of retailers including Roku, The Woobles, Jeep, Sonic, Pickleball, Susan Alexandra, Samsung, etc
- A free subscription to a variety of services including Peacock, Everand, etc
- An experience from a variety of providers such as a music festival, sports game, FIFA World Cup, international destination, etc
- A cash prize ranging from $50 all the way up to $10,000

Note that the gift cards, physical prizes, subscriptions, experiences, and cash prizes are only available in the Bonus Play section. So it's very important to do the Bonus Play.

---

**I won a prize! :)**

---

Congratulations! If you got a food prize or points, tap on the X in the upper left corner to exit out of the Monopoly game. Then tap on Rewards & Deals in the center button at the bottom of the app. If you got points, these will be in the upper right corner of the app (tap on ""View History"" to see the exact amount). If you got a food prize, tap on ""View All"" and scroll down until you see your prize.

If you got a non-food prize such as a gift card or cash prize, you'll receive an email with instructions on how to redeem your prize.

Bear in mind all prizes may take several minutes, or even a few hours, to process. If you don't see your prize right away come back later. In the meantime, read the ""But wait, there's more!"" section above **since you can do Bonus Play even if you won a prize.**

---

**How do I enter the contest again?**

---

After using the first code from your email, repeat steps 7-10 for the second code from your email.

After using the second code, repeat steps 2-10 to get more codes. You can submit the form up to 5 times each day, and each email has 2 codes, which means you can get up to 10 codes free each day. A new ""day"" begins at 12:00 AM Eastern Time, 11:00 PM Central Time, 10:00 PM Mountain Time, and 9:00 PM Pacific Time.

**Tip:** You don't have to do steps 2-10 one at a time. You can submit the email form (steps 2-3) five consecutive times to get five codes, then do steps 5-6 consecutively, then steps 7-10 consecutively. This should expedite the process.",41,1759791824.0,Freefood,6,0.98,False

‚ÄãI'm getting married soon, and I'm really excited, but also kind of stressed about the guest list. 

I have a fantastic group of close friends & Colleagues here in Bahrain, and I absolutely want them there. They're such a huge part of my life, and their support means the world.

‚ÄãHere's the problem: my wedding is going to be extremely low-key and non-traditional.
‚ÄãWe're not having a big ballroom, a fancy zaffa, a huge seated dinner, or a band/DJ playing traditional Arabic or Gulf music. 

Basically, none of the typical awesome, high-energy wedding elements that make Bahraini weddings so vibrant and fun!
‚ÄãInstead, we're planning something like:
‚ÄãA quick, modern ceremony (maybe 30 minutes).
‚ÄãA chill cocktail time.
‚ÄãA simple, gourmet buffet/food stations.
‚ÄãJust light background music (acoustic covers)
‚ÄãNo dancing/minimal planned entertainment.


‚ÄãIt‚Äôs just... quiet. And frankly, I'm worried it's going to be super boring for my friends who are used to the incredible energy and celebratory atmosphere of local weddings. I don't want them to feel like they wasted a Saturday night on a snooze-fest, or worse, feel obligated to come and then leave early disappointed.

‚ÄãMy question is: How can I invite them without giving the wrong impression? Should I:
‚ÄãBe upfront? Like, ""It's not a traditional party‚Äîit's very chill, just wanted you there for the ceremony.""
‚ÄãAdd a tiny Bahraini touch? (Like a small date and coffee station, maybe? To make them feel welcome?)
‚ÄãJust relax and assume they're my friends and they won't care?
‚Äã
Has anyone else been to a very non-traditional wedding after attending big Gulf weddings? What was your honest take? I love these people and want them to feel celebrated, not underwhelmed!

‚ÄãThanks for any advice! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2,1759791737.0,Bahrain,0,1.0,False

I started grinding my teeth at night, bad. Massages did nothing. Huge knots formed in my neck/shoulders from the insane tension every day. No matter how hard I tried I couldn‚Äôt relax while driving, walking, doing anything. 

I noticed it really bad one day after drinking my morning coffee. I googled ‚Äú can coffee make you tense your muscles‚Äù 

Well turns out yes, it can! It can raise cortisol, fight or flight, etc. 

I‚Äôve switched to a cup of green tea now for 5 days which still has caffeine but‚Ä¶ still had the withdrawals, headaches, actually took a nap, and I‚Äôve been dreaming for the first time in I don‚Äôt know how long.. 

And I‚Äôm able to actually relax my jaw. 

Only downside is, I can‚Äôt stop eating and my belly looks bigger than usual? Oh, also having some weird repetitive thoughts‚Ä¶ my dopamine receptors trying to regulate themselves? The words ‚Äúfeeling bullish‚Äù and ‚Äúfeeling bearish‚Äù keeps repeating in my head üòÇ though I do feel calmer ‚Ä¶ maybe a bit more tired and unmotivated‚Ä¶ 

All in all I think I‚Äôll stick with the green tea for now as it‚Äôs getting me through the worst of withdrawals. Then who knows, may switch to lemon water & honey. ",5,1759791444.0,decaf,7,0.86,False

It‚Äôs clean, distraction-free, and works directly in your browser (no login, no setup). You just enter your event date and it goes full screen automatically.

1nzy6a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Prestigious-Cup-9742/comments/1nzy6a3/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_felt_uncomfortable/,AITA for telling my friend I felt uncomfortable always paying when we hung out?,"So, I (F) had this friend I used to hang out with pretty often. Over time I started noticing a pattern ‚Äî every time we went out for coffee or food, I was always the one paying. It wasn‚Äôt even about the money itself, it was about the principle and the fact that it started to feel one-sided. I don‚Äôt mind paying for people sometimes, but when it becomes a pattern with no reciprocity or acknowledgment, it just feels off.

I didn‚Äôt say anything for a while, but recently I decided to be honest. She texted me asking to meet at the same caf√© we always go to, and I replied saying, ‚ÄúHey, I can‚Äôt today, and honestly I‚Äôve been trying to save money because I usually end up paying a lot when we hang out, and I can‚Äôt afford it anymore.‚Äù I also added that from now on, I‚Äôd prefer if we just split.

Her first reply was: ‚ÄúGirly it‚Äôs calm, I got money!‚Äù
I told her, ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs calm ‚Äî we should go when we both have money so we can split from now on.‚Äù

Then she suddenly went, ‚ÄúAre we okay? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

I reassured her we were fine, just that I needed to be real because I noticed a pattern and it made me uncomfortable. I said I wanted things to be fair going forward.

Instead of just saying, ‚ÄúOh wow, I didn‚Äôt realize, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she got defensive. She said:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt was never my intention to make you uncomfortable.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI communicate when I don‚Äôt have money, and when I do, I pay too.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me sooner.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt went over my head to ever return the favor.‚Äù

Then she half-apologized ‚Äî saying sorry but also blaming me for not speaking up sooner. I told her clearly it wasn‚Äôt about throwing the friendship away over ‚Äúsplitting fees,‚Äù but about the principle ‚Äî the lack of consideration for me and my circumstances.

She kept going in circles, saying she was confused, that she sat around worrying about us, and that she ‚Äúwould never throw a friendship out the window over outing fees.‚Äù Eventually, I said my piece, told her I had no ill will, and left it there. A couple days later, she blocked me.

Now I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî was I too blunt? I tried to be respectful and mature, but she made me feel like I was overreacting or petty. I just wanted fairness and boundaries. And now I wonder if the whole friendship was about using me 

TL;DR: I told my friend I felt uncomfortable always being the one paying and wanted to start splitting. Instead of just apologizing, she got defensive, made it about me not telling her sooner, and later blocked me. AITA?",1,1759791319.0,u_Prestigious-Cup-9742,0,1.0,False
