Hi -

I‚Äôm on the road for work and would a chat to break up the airport time. 

A bit about me: I enjoy camping, reading, cooking, going to the gym, and traveling. My favorite food is pizza. The best part of the day is that first sip of coffee. The worst part of the day is that first Zoom meeting. I love Japan and have a major crush on Italy. But I‚Äôll take a national park any day. 

How‚Äôs this for an icebreaker: what‚Äôs your favorite book?

Can‚Äôt pick one? Try! I know it‚Äôs hard. And audiobooks count. 

I don‚Äôt think I could pick one‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll go with Pachinko. 

Looking forward to getting a notification! ",1,1741982559.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1jbct2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jbct2p/i_have_a_crush_on_my_friends_brother/,I have a crush on my friends brother,"I had a person I considered a friend. I met her at my hospital job at a different department. We hit off quickly and exchanged numbers. I found out she was attending a school/ program I graduated from, so I exchanged the resources I had. In the process, we started to get to know each other as friends and build a bond. She invited me to her graduation, and I found her brother attractive. I was incredibly shy about making a move on the brother or saying anything to her until we met up for coffee, and causality brought it up. She reacted okay. She asked if I had an Instagram so her brother could see, but I don‚Äôt post any photos there. 
I do have personal photos of myself on my phone. She said she would ask him and get back to me, and I said okay. In our conversation, she was texting someone, which I assume is her brother. Her brother called her and said out loud, ‚ÄúOh, what a coincidence, my brother is calling me.‚Äù I felt a little off‚Ä¶ they exchanged some words on the phone, and her mom called her as well, and she said she had to go home. It was getting a little late in the coffee shop. I asked her a personal question about herself before the situation occurred. It was a little random, but it wasn‚Äôt a crazy question, and she was emotional about it, so I quickly apologized. So, it set the tone off a little bit. She walked me to my car, and we said our goodbyes. I texted that night to tell her it was nice seeing her and that I hoped she got home safely. I also sent her a screenshot of something that she was curious about when we were at the coffee. It‚Äôs mid-afternoon, and I still haven‚Äôt gotten any response. I can‚Äôt help but overthink. I do have a lot of anxiety. I talked to some of my friends, and they said it was normal and that I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. It was way out of my comfort zone. I‚Äôm wondering if things do go left.

Last year I relocated to California (Nor Cal, nearish the Bay Area) and now that I'm settled in I'm hoping to make some friends since at this point in life I'm not entirely sure how to go about that anymore!  I would love to meet someone local to me since I don't have anyone close to me right now, but I'm not opposed to online either, especially if we have some stuff in common that we could do. Not interested in starting off with anything sexual.

A little bit about me:

\-I have a dog and a cat, both rescues. My dog thinks he's a cat, and my cat thinks he's a dog. It works out somehow.

  
\-I am on the introverted side, and like texting. I'd be down to meet up at some point, and I have discord and am happy to voice there too but texting is definitely easier on me to start with :)

\-I work as an engineer so I'm probably overall reasonably intelligent but can 100% be exceptionally dumb at times

\-LOVE a good cup of coffee and drink way too much of it.

\-I think I have a reasonably good sense of humor. I always laugh at my own jokes.

\-My hobbies kind of change with whatever I happen to be in the mood for but to name a few:

\-I love reading and will be completely unable to put down a good book. I especially like that where I am now the weather is nice enough most of the year to be able to read outside. My typical genre is fantasy/sci-fi but I won't turn down suggestions and am happy to branch out

\-I enjoy cooking, but am not great about doing it just for me. I like pasta way too much and protein way too little, but I overall don't have any dietary restrictions and am not picky.

\-I enjoy arts and crafty stuff when I'm feeling creative; everything from cross stitch, polymer clay, to a good ol coloring book. I do not know what to do with any of these things on the rare occasion I actually finish them 

\-I also game (PC mainly, though I do have a switch). The only game I'm really dedicated to is WoW (and with the new season in swing I'm playing a good amount, am reasonably competitive in it, and would love someone to do keys with) but my highest playtime in other games would be Smite, PoE, Hearthstone, TFT, and Palworld. Like most people, I have a few games in steam that I haven't gotten around to yet.

\-I work from home and can be a little inactive as a result, but I walk my dog and enjoy being outside and am overall happy with my appearance. I am not much into sports but used to play golf and probably would again if it weren't so expensive.

  
If it sounds like we have anything in common I'd love to hear from you :) Happy Friday

""...sometimes, all I need is the air that I breath and to love you...""

The song faded out and a commercial for car insurance was telling him he could save up to 15% if he signed up with them. Jon hit the button on the clock radio. His eyes did not want to open, Janet had slipped him that tranq pill to ""help him sleep"" but it had knocked him on his ass. He fumbled around for his phone, through slitted eyes he read the date. Monday, he had gone to bed Saturday night at around 3am. He sat up quickly, his head immediately throbbed with pain. Jesus, he thought, did I really sleep through an entire day? It was 5:45am, he had to get ready for work. He stood up and stretched, his back popped and cracked. He headed to the bathroom for a shower.



The hot shower had helped, he felt awake and ready to go. His stomach grumbled and he went to the fridge. Not much in the way of breakfast food, he closed the door, he'd just stop at McDonald's and get a sausage mcmuffin. He checked his watch, 6:15, he had to clock in at 7 so he still had plenty of time. He got dressed and grabbed his keys. It was nice out, birds chirped and a cool breeze ruffled his damp hair. The street was oddly quiet for a Monday morning, but it was still early. He hopped in his Jetta and pulled out of the driveway. As he pulled onto Main St. there was no traffic. He pulled up at a red light, McDonald's was 3 more lights down. He was looking around and still couldn't see anyone. It was beginning to feel weird. He rolled down his window, the city was eerily silent. The light turned green, he didn't move, instead he stepped put of his car. There was a diner to his left, he could see through the windows, it was empty. On his right was a Shell gas station, he got back in his car and pulled into the gas station. He peered through the door before stepping inside, empty.

""Hello?""

He walked to the back of the store, the stockroom door hung open. He poked his head in. No one.

""What the...""

He got back in his car and drove down to the McDonald's, ignoring the traffic lights now as a sense of panic began to rise in his chest. He pulled into the drive thru, past the speaker and up to the window, noone inside. He pulled out his phone, scrolled through his contacts and hit send on Janet's name.

Straight to voicemail. He tried his buddy Jordan, 4 rings then voicemail. He tried his boss, straight to voicemail. He stood staring at his phone in disbelief. He got back in his car and drove the rest of the way to the office. He worked as an office supply distributor, his boss always answered the phone. There was seemingly noone in the building, his boss, Ken should be in his office. He knocked then opened the door, empty. He pulled out his phone again, it still said Monday, now 6:52am. Should he even bother clocking in? He laughed, but it wasn't genuine, deep down he was afraid.



He had tried to call a few more people unsuccessfully, then decided to drive to Janet's but her house was empty. He cruised through the surrounding neighborhoods, there should be kids getting ready for school, waiting for the bus. There should be people on their morning commute, sipping coffee and waiting in traffic while they listened to podcasts. There was noone. The streets were empty, the houses were empty, it's as if every human being in Tampa had evaporated. He remembered the story about the rapture from his days in Sunday school as a kid. That would have left behind all the sinners, but that couldn't be right, there were a lot of sinners in Florida. He chuckled at the thought, but it gave him an idea. He knew where the ""hood"" was, if this was the rapture, those wannabe gangsters would still be around. He headed to Highland Pines, he drove slowly through the area. It was still dead silent through here, no movement, nothing and nobody.



He sat in the middle of the road, his door open, one leg out of the car. He was staring straight ahead, his mind trying to work out what was going on. He had gone through every possibility he could think of. Rapture? no. Mass evacuation? Maybe, but for what? Mass extinction? There would be bodies, so no. He stepped out of his car and started walking along the sidewalk, his hands jammed in his pockets and his head down. He stopped suddenly and turned towards the row of run down houses next to him. He walked up to the first one he saw and walked in.

""Hello? Anybody here?""

The place reeked of weed. He stepped onto the living room, the TV was on and Steve Harvey was making a face at the camera as the contestants on the Family Feud behind him laughed. He walked upstairs, the bedrooms were empty. He tried three more houses, all empty. He began to wonder how big this was. Did everyone in Tampa disappear or was this global? A loud growl came from his stomach, he still hadn't eaten. He had an idea.



He went back to his car and headed back to McDonald's. He stepped around the counter and went to the grill. He had worked at Sonic when he was younger, he knew how it all worked. He turned on the gas and hit the ignitor then turned on the fryers. 20 minutes later he had potato cakes, a sausage and cheese mcmuffin, and a cinnamon roll. He sat at a table and ate. The silence was unnerving, he stared out the window at the lifeless world beyond.



He sat at a bus stop bench for a couple of hours, still waiting, hoping to see someone. No cars drove by, there was no bus coming. He wished he could smoke a blunt right now, internally, he was freaking out. This gave him another idea, Big Jay, aka Jason Brentwood was the guy he usually called when he needed pot. He drove to Jay's house, the door was unlocked. It was a modest 2 story home, he found Jay's bedroom, he had been in here buying sacks many times. He slid the large wooden box out from under the bed and raised the lid. There was about a quarter pound of weed in a large freezer zip-loc bag. There were a bunch of pre-bagged $25 sacks and a few different pill bottles. There was also a pearl handled chrome Beretta 9mm. He ran his fingers over the gun, ""Jesus Jay, you're not playing huh?""

He grabbed a pre-bagged sack of weed and started to close the lid but stopped. He opened the lid again, threw the small baggie back in and pulled out the large freezer bag.

""Why not, it's not like you'll be needing it."" he chuckled.



He sat in Big Jay's driveway and rolled a fat blunt. He touched flame to the tip and inhaled, ""This one's for you Jay, wherever you are."" He sat there getting stoned and trying to keep his mind off the empty world around him.



He woke up in the smoky car and coughed, he hadn't meant to doze off. He raised his seat and opened the door, the smoke rolled out, catching the breeze and curling off into the sky. Jon was baked and the munchies were starting to take hold. Out of the corner of his eye he caught movement, he turned, expecting to see Big Jay come walking up, his mind went to the large bag of marijuana on his passenger seat. ""He's gonna kick my ass."" he thought. It wasn't Jay though, he stared at the creature coming up the street, it was tall and thin, with 4 legs and 2 arms like a centaur but it had black skin and the face of a human. In one hand it held what looked like a square piece of glass, the size of a paperback. It was tapping rapidly at the glass and mumbling to itself. Jon ducked behind his car, he almost fell over. He was breathing hard, sweat was breaking out on his forehead, he was scared. He peeked through the window, the creature hadn't noticed him. He was trying to control his breathing, ""Don't panic."" repeated over and over in his head. As the grotesque creatures was almost even with the car, Jon started slowly making his way around the front of the vehicle. His shoe scuffed on the pavement, he froze. He peeked up, looking through the windshield. The creature was moving toward the car. He had to make a decision and he only had seconds to do it. He turned and bolted towards Big Jay's front door. Behind him the creature yelled in a strange warbling voice ""You're not supposed to be here!"" Then he was inside, he ran up the stairs and down the hall to Jay's bedroom. The Beretta felt heavy in his hand, but it's weight was comforting. The gun had been laying on top of two extra magazines, both loaded. He slid the mags in his pocket and went to the top of the stairs. He could see the front door from here, he leveled the pistol at it. A shadow fell on the doorway, the gun was shaking, sweat rolled down his back. A black three fingered hand wrapped around the side of the door and pushed it open. The creature stepped in, Jon pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He stepped back into the shadows of the hallway. He could hear its footsteps downstairs. It hadn't seen him yet, he looked at the gun and then it hit him, he hadn't racked the slide. He did it quiet as he could, there was a click as the bullet slid into the chamber. The footsteps downstairs stopped, Jon went to the top of the stairs again and looked down. The creature was staring right at him, ""You there, you're not supposed to be here.""

Jon froze again, he wanted to pull the trigger but this thing, whatever it was, didn't appear to be threatening. ""Wha...what the fuck are you?""

His voice came out weak. The creature tilted it's head,

""I'm a timekeeper.""

The gun was shaking again, his hands were slicked with sweat, his shirt was soaked through as well.

""I don't know what that means...where is everybody?""

The timekeeper squinted it's beady black eyes at him.

""Don't you know?""

""I know I woke up and everybody's gone.""

""This is a dead timeline Mr...""

""Jon.""

""Mr. Jon, you should have moved on with everyone else.""

""I don't understand.""

""Nor do I.""

""Are you going to kill me?""

""No Mr. Jon, I'm just here to inventory this timeline.""

""So, what happens to me?""

""Nothing. You live out your days in this timeline. I've never known of anyone being left behind, I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.""

Jon shoved the pistol in his belt.

""Can you send me to the proper timeline?""

""I'm afraid not, our time displacement devices are installed in our heads. I can only move myself through time.""

Jon's hand went to the pistol. The creature watched him.

""You could kill me, but even if you dug the device out of my head, it wouldn't work for you. They only function for the person who's bio-key it matches. I will make a note of your displacement though, maybe management will see fit to send someone to retrieve you. It was a pleasure to meet you Mr. Jon.""

The creature made a small bow and then faded out of existence. Jon ran down the stairs to where it had been standing. Nothing, it was gone. He sat on the bottom stair and put his head in his hands.

""What the hell?!"" He asked the empty house. He pulled the pistol from his waistband and turned it over in his hands. He wasnt a religious man, never had taken to it. He knew suicide was a sin to the catholics, maybe it was. Life was precious. Life was fragile, and finally, Life was a gift. He thought all three were probably true. He put the barrel in his mouth. The cold metal clicked against his teeth uncomfortably. Tears dripped from the corner of his eyes. He tried to squeeze the trigger but he couldn't make his finger do the deed. He dropped the gun to the floor. He was alone, regardless of what that alien thing had told him, noone was coming to take him to a timeline populated with people. He knew it in his heart. The timekeeper had been just another cog in some cosmic form of bureaucracy. He was a lone number on a report filed away in a great filing cabinet amongst the stars. He wasnt ready to give up though, not yet. The world was his now. He looked down at the gun that had belonged to his weed dealer, ""won't be needing that."" He stepped out the front door, a world of possibilities lay in front of him.



He got in his car and took off, his speed slowly increasing until he was tearing down the long road at 95mph. His adrenaline was pumping and he was screaming, a strange mix of laughter and sobs. He felt the glee of absolute freedom but that emotion would be quickly replaced by a crushing dread. Back and forth his emotions went, he felt as if he might explode. Finally he slammed on the brakes, leaving long black lines in the road behind him. His vision was blurred, he wiped his eyes and sat there, staring at the car lot on the right side of the road. His breathing had returned to normal and he thought he just might be ok. Big Jim's used cars had a healthy assortment of old and new, but it was one car in particular that caught his attention. There, amongst the section of older muscle cars, sat a cherry '69 Chevelle. The sun sparkled off the flecks in the dark grey paint, two thick black racing stripes ran the length of the car. He got out of his little blue Jetta, he grabbed the bag of weed and tossed the keys onto the driver seat. ""Thanks for everything old girl, but I'm trading up!"" He exclaimed with a smile.



It had taken him almost half an hour to break into the main office and locate the key box, then find the correct key. Now he sat in the Chevelle revving the engine, she was a 427 with 425 horsepower. With each press of the gas pedal the car twisted ever so slightly, like a crouching panther ready to pounce. He backed it out slowly and drove out into the road, snaking around his Jetta. He sat at a red light as if it was a track light, he revved and waited. The lights for the side roads turned yellow and he tightened his hands on the steering wheel. The light turned green and he floored it, the car didn't move right away as the wheels spun in place and then they caught. The front of the car lifted and then came down and he was streaking down the empty road, the engine roaring like a monster unleashed. Had anyone been watching and able to look through the window they would have thought he was a madman. His eyes were wide, his lips curled back so far they almost touched his ears, his teeth gritted. The road ended in about a mile and it was fast approaching, he slammed the brakes, pulled the e-brake and spun the wheel. The car spun in a half circle, a cloud of white smoke surrounded him so thick he couldn't see. He stepped out of the car, his legs wobbly. Fear and adrenaline are a potent mixture and he thought for a moment he might pass out. He leaned against the hood of the still rumbling car, ""WHOOOOOOOOO!"" He yelled as loud as he could. He felt good. He thought of the gun in his mouth only an hour ago, glad he decided to wait. ""Alright, now that I got that out of my system, what else can we get into?""



3 WEEKS LATER



The timekeeper materialized in the road next to the Chevelle. He held a modified time chip. ""I have returned Mr. Jon, come to take you to the proper timeline...Mr. Jon?"" The sun was reflecting off the windshield and the timekeeper couldnt see anything but a silhouette in the drivers seat. There was no response. He opened the drivers side door and Jon's hand flopped out, the glock he had been holding fell to the ground. Blood was oozing out of the hole in his head. The tears on his cheeks were still wet. ""I'm sorry I did not arrive sooner Mr. Jon."" The creature put his hand on Jon's face and closed his lifeless eyes. He tapped on his tablet and then shook his head. ""Rest easy Mr. Jon."" The creature slowly faded out of existence.",1,1741981021.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1jbc0ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jbc0ev/im_annoyed/,I'm annoyed.,"I'm (35 f) not a Keto newbie. This is the 3rd time I've done it. I used keto to get pregnant twice. I have lean PCOS and keto alleviated all symptoms, regulated my hormones and cycles, and my body feels best when on it. 

Jan 2022 I started keto (first time after 2 years of unsuccessful fertility treatments), paired with intermittent fasting (18/6). I didn't have much weight to lose but, cycles were regulated within 2 months and I was pregnant (and stayed pregnant!) By march 2022. 

June 2023 (TTC #2) weighed in at 160 (residual baby fat from Nov 22 pregnancy), started keto for the second time + intermittent fasting. By Sept 2023 I was back down to 133 pounds, and conceived baby #2 in Oct 2023. 

Jan 2025 I decided to start keto again for the 3rd time. No more babies planned, but I had left over weight from my second pregnancy and, like I said, my body preforms best on keto. 

Here's why I'm annoyed. 

Jan 2025 I weighed in at 162 pounds. 
Feb 1st I weighed in at 151. Nice. 11 pounds first month. A breeze. I stayed at 151 till THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. As of today, March 14th, im 144. Thats 6 pounds in 6 weeks. A pound a week. Which, I get it, it's healthy. And I should be happy. But I feel like I could get this pound a week off with a basic diet and no fasting. I keep my carbs below 25gs a day. My protein is high. Some days I'm full carnivor. I walk 5km a day (weather permitting. I'm in Canada). My only guess is, my water intake is absolute garbage. I drink coffee all day till 4pm (I'm a SAHM so, thats 16oz of coffee total, over a 8hr period. If you know, you know). However... my water intake has ALWAYS been shit so, any ideas why this time is so different than the other 2? I'm doing everything the same. And I'm seriously frustrated. Goal weight is between 130 and 135. I thought I'd be there by April 1st. üôÑ",0,1741980369.0,keto,9,0.4,False

I‚Äôve never had much luck with love.

Not for lack of interest, mind you; always wanted a family of my own. I just don‚Äôt think the good lord created me with romance at the forefront of their blueprint, though. Me on a date is like taking a sedan off-roading. Sure, it can be done, but it ain‚Äôt graceful, nor is it really the point of that particular vehicle, and most people don‚Äôt elect to give it a second try after the first. They lease out a jeep instead.

A large part of it comes down to attraction. Simply put, I don‚Äôt think I'm most desirable bachelor.

I‚Äôm bulky; not obese per se, but I‚Äôm not exactly chiseled, either. Closer to Dionysos than Adonis in terms of body frame. Not only that, but I‚Äôm not much of a conversationist. Even if I was born with a silver tongue, I wouldn‚Äôt have much to speak on. Never had much fascination with pop culture, music or cinema; topics that most folk are well-versed in that can help break the ice.

No, my singular hobby has always been decidedly devoid of any and all sex-appeal, at least in my experience; woodworking.

What can I say? There‚Äôs just a certain satisfaction in handiwork that has always appealed to me. Not only that, but the act of creation can be meditative, like prayer. But unlike prayer, something actually comes of it in the end.

I suppose I appreciate the pursuit because it makes me feel useful, which is the best segue I can come up with to introduce Bella, the woman who sunk her canines into my back on the subway three weeks ago.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt know what her actual name is. The police don‚Äôt either, for that matter. In the months that led up to the assault, however, I‚Äôd started thinking of her as *""Bella""*. I was much too bashful to ask her real name, nor do I think it‚Äôs any man‚Äôs place to bother a young lady with unsolicited personal inquiries, but we interacted frequently enough where ‚Äú*there‚Äôs that beautiful Italian woman again*‚Äù felt a little impersonal, even if I was only saying it in my head.

It‚Äôs a touch pathetic, I know. I will point out that the name wasn't chosen on a whim. *""Bella""* seemed to capture her essence quite well, both the beauty of her person and the tragedy of her existence.

She was always wheezing.

Her lungs squeaked and huffed like a decade-old chewed-up dog toy, no matter what she was doing. Even when she was still, she'd wheeze. Bella was discrete about it, and she never seemed to be in distress, but I didn‚Äôt like the public‚Äôs indifference to her plight, regardless of her apparent control and stability.

Just because an amputee seems adept with their crutches, doesn't mean you don't look to help them where you can.

Saw her for the first time nine months ago. I stepped onto the metro to find that the seats were filled, somehow leaving Bella as the only one standing; audibly rasping while leaning her body against a pole. The seats weren‚Äôt even completely occupied by people, either; a small middle-aged man in a cheap suit was overflowing into¬†*both*¬†of his adjacent spaces. One seat for his tablet, another for the remains of his breakfast sandwich.

I‚Äôm not usually one to stick my neck where it doesn‚Äôt belong, but that didn‚Äôt sit right with me.

After some gentle cajoling on my part, the man relented and cleaned up his trash so Bella could sit. I could tell he was livid, but he didn‚Äôt argue either, probably on account of the size difference between me and him. While it was true that I‚Äôve probably taken shits that weighed more than that man on multiple occasions, I wouldn‚Äôt ever have hurt him. He didn‚Äôt know that, though. He likely interpreted my quiet disposition as a sign that I could be dangerous; things that are¬†*actually*¬†dangerous don‚Äôt need to be showy about it.

As Bella sat down, her wheezing slowed. She thanked me, and I could see in her warm brown eyes that she was happy to be off her feet.

I smiled, nodded my head, and that was it. Didn't try to talk to her. Didn't stare. As gorgeous as she was, I considered our business concluded.

When I departed the train at my stop about ten minutes later, I happened to notice that those warm brown eyes were following me off as well. Surprise at her ongoing interest blushed my face the color of a maraschino cherry, no doubt. Can‚Äôt imagine that was very becoming of me, either. It‚Äôs one thing when a handsome, Casanova-type blushes; the brightness just adds definition to their already perfect contours. Me though? Just doesn‚Äôt look right. No one wants to see Mr. Hyde blush.

Still, I‚Äôd be lying if I pretended like it didn‚Äôt pleasantly flutter my heart.

From that day on, Bella was already there when I hopped on the train for work. Picked up her things when she dropped them out of reach a few times. Helped her up when she tripped and fell once. We never talked, though, and I was perfectly content with that. I had no illusions about my position in the hierarchy, nor did I let myself fantasize like some sort of love-drunk teenager. Nothing wrong with that when you‚Äôre¬†*actually*¬†a teenager, but I haven‚Äôt been one of those in quite a long while.

Like with my woodworking, I was just happy to feel useful; when the opportunity arose, at least.

Bella perceived this desire in me, too, apparently.

I was exactly what she had been searching for.

\- - - - -

The pain was unreal, but somehow, the shock of it all was even worse. I didn‚Äôt even hear Bella approach until she was practically wheezing into my ear.

*‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre just perfect,‚Äù*¬†she murmured, words accented by the sharp hisses coming from her throat like she had swallowed a live cobra.

Before I could even begin to process that statement, an explosive pain detonated in my shoulder blade. It felt like thousands of serrated pins swirling aimlessly through my flesh, eviscerating my brittle nerves until they were barely intact enough to cry out anymore. Honestly, I thought someone had shot me.

I threw my hand around my back, looking to access the injury with my fingertips. There was something in the way, however. Whatever it was, the force of my movement broke through it with hardly any resistance, and my hand kept going until it crashed into something hot, sturdy, and pulsating.

There was a muffled whimper, vocalizations vibrating uncomfortably against my back, and the pain lessened. When I spun around, my mind struggled to comprehend what I saw.

Bella, smiling at me, revealing a mouth full of peg-shaped, overcrowded teeth that dripped with freshly liberated blood. I recall there were rows and rows of chalky white fangs that seemed to go on forever, deeper and deeper into her gullet, or at least I couldn't see where they stopped.

Hundreds of those grotesque molars had bitten straight through my jacket and undershirt.

As if that wasn't enough, there was also a massive cavity in the right side of her chest where my hand had connected. It was almost like Bella was rib-less, as my fingers had cleanly cut through her torso until it collided with¬†*some*¬†midline structure, tucking the fabric of her wispy sundress into the new crease in a way that made me instantly nauseous.

I‚Äôm strong, but I certainly wasn‚Äôt capable of caving in a woman‚Äôs chest without even trying.

At that point, another passenger was closing in behind Bella, arms outstretched to apprehend the maniac woman. With a motion that would have bordered on elegant if it wasn‚Äôt so starkly terrifying, she twisted her upper body and extended her spine, placing her palms onto the floor between the passenger‚Äôs legs. Her nails clawed at the metal, screeching as she skittered under the man on all fours without colliding into him. Before anyone else could react, Bella had slithered through the closing subway doors, barely clearing the narrow threshold before it shut completely.

And with that, she was gone. The train jerked and then began chugging forward. I glimpsed Bella through the window as we gained speed, crawling up the stairs, still on all fours.

In a state of silent disorientation, I slowly sat down on the floor, closed my eyes, lowered my head into my hands, and receded into myself.

Even then, I could tell that the pain was changing. The stabbing sensation waned; it was gradually being replaced by a feeling that was agonizing in a different, less physical way.

My wound tickled, writhed, and twitched.

\- - - - -

*‚ÄúSo, do you know who she is? Was she stalking me or something?‚Äù*¬†I asked the detective over the phone two days after the incident.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He paused, clicking his tongue.

*‚ÄúNot in the legal sense, no. She was clearly very‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶entranced with you.‚Äù*

Absurdly, he said nothing further; like¬†*that*¬†was a satisfactory answer to my question.

*‚ÄúI apologize, Sir, but could you kindly elaborate on what that means?‚Äù*

Another few clicks of his tongue, a handful of false starts with ‚Äú*Uhhs‚Äù*¬†that trailed off to nowhere, and then a minute later, he finally expanded on the notion of Bella being¬†*entranced with me.*¬†While I waited for the man to conjure some sort of explanation, I sifted through the day's mail.

Right before he started speaking, my eyes landed on a weathered envelope at the bottom of the pile. No return address. No stamp. Didn‚Äôt even have my name on it. In raggedy, child-like handwriting, it simply read:¬†*‚ÄúFor the nice man on the train.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe woman who bit you sat on the subway for about eighteen hours every day, without fail. Didn't eat, didn't drink. For the last ninety days, she did, at least. Transportation authority doesn‚Äôt hold CCTV footage for longer than three months,""*¬†he said.

My heart thundered wildly against my sternum as I pulled the crumpled message out of its envelope.

‚Äú*She didn‚Äôt move much. Would just kind of gaze out the window most of the day. But whenever you were on the train, she watched you like a hawk‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I hung up. Couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. It was too much all at one time.

My eyes scanned the note.

Twenty letters. Five words. Didn‚Äôt make a lick of sense.

*‚Äúonce mother, come find me‚Äù*

*- - - - -*

A week off of work helped at first. Kept my mind occupied with household chores. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt have to grapple with the possibility of encountering Bella on the train, a myriad of overlapping fangs jutting through her smile like stalactites on the roof of a cave. Home just felt safer.

There was an undeniable irrationality to that impression, though.

She had been at my house. Recently, too. The letter had clearly been hand delivered.

I ignored that inconsistency and immersed myself in the overdue handiwork. Cleaned out the gutters. Took a bus out to the nearest Home Depot to pick up some wasp spray for a new hive growing out of an open pipe in my basement. Attended to my vegetable garden.

All the while, the lump on my shoulder blade continued to grow.

It wasn‚Äôt much at first; just a marble-sized blister on the very tip of my scapula. If you examined it at just the right angle, the growth looked like it was the exact center of a circle established by the clusters of raw, peg-shaped bite marks surrounding it.

When it tripled in size overnight, I practically sprinted to the urgent care, which was only a few blocks away. The doctor didn‚Äôt seem too impressed by the lesion, which was a relief. That said, never in my life have I interacted with a health care professional that looked more dead behind the eyes. Through a series of grumbles, they informed me it was likely a bacterial abscess from the bite, but it was nothing a ten-day course of antibiotics couldn‚Äôt remedy.

Of course, the medicine didn‚Äôt do jackshit. How could it?

It wasn‚Äôt even targeting the type of thing that was germinating in that makeshift womb.

\- - - - -

By the end of the week, it felt as though a tangerine had been surgically implanted underneath my skin. Not only that, but I began experiencing other symptoms as well. My entire body felt swollen and heavy, like buckets of dense saltwater were sloshing around in my tissue with every movement. A dry, hacking cough took hold of me every few minutes. Despite getting nearly double my normal amount of sleep, I woke up every day groggy and debilitated by an unyielding malaise.

Wanted it to be the flu. At least, I wanted to¬†*convince*¬†myself that I was coming down with influenza. The alternative was far worse. A ticking metronome expanding under my shoulder blade made that illusion basically impossible to maintain, though.

My symptoms and the growth were clearly connected.

There wasn‚Äôt really pain around the bite anymore. Or, if there was, a more unexplainable feeling drowned it out. By then, the twitching, writhing sensation had become much louder and unsettlingly rhythmic; a swarm of microscopic firecrackers imploding inside the confines of that cyst every five seconds, like clockwork. It was much worse at night, but a double dose of my before-bed sleep aid brought unconsciousness deep enough to afford me brief respite from the sensation.

Until one evening when I could ignore it no longer.

\- - - - -

The sun had just started to crest under the horizon, casting curtains of dim light into my home; the decaying shadows of an unlit room embraced by a withering twilight. I was pacing furiously around my first floor, at my wit's end with the sensation and contemplating what to do next, shirt off since the fabric of my flannel was irritating the growth. At the same time, I was attempting to keep a simmering panic attack from completely taking over. No matter which way I looked at the situation, though, my mind kept arriving at the same answer.

Might be time for the hospital.

When I finally accepted that was the only reasonable course of action, it had become too dark to see, and I felt liable to trip over furniture as I gathered my coat and wallet. Cautiously, I found my way to a lamp and flicked it on. The presence of something unexpected on the armrest of my couch, in synergy with my frenzied state, startled me to high heaven, causing my heart to leap into my throat.

A paper wasp was buzzing quietly over the upholstery.

Now, under normal circumstances, I‚Äôm not a hot-tempered person. But, at that moment, I wasn‚Äôt quite myself. A volatile mixture of sleep deprivation, panic, and fear coursed through my veins. In truth, I was a Molotov cocktail anxiously waiting for the match; primed and ready to burn.

The spark of adrenaline that came with being surprised was enough to ignite the dormant rage inside me.

I stomped over to the hallway closet, swung the door open with such force that its doorknob dented the adjacent wall as it slammed against the plaster, and grabbed my heaviest work boots by the pull-strap. At that point, the wasp had meandered over to the surface of my coffee table, calm and wholly unaware of its imminent demise. Wide eyed and boiling, I ran towards the creature and brought the heel down on its fragile body like an executioner. A sickening, chitinous crunch radiated up my arm. As it did, my rage seemingly vanished; dissipated instantly, like the details of a dream quickly drifting away after waking.

In the absence of anger, I felt a terrible, heart-wrenching regret. A profound sadness that I had absolutely no explanation for.

When my eye glimpsed movement on my back in a nearby mirror, though, I began to understand. A gradual, tortuous realization that defied explanation.

In stunned horror, I watched a pair of tiny wriggling thorns sprout from the flesh of my growth. Twitching. Writhing. After extending about a half inch above the surface, they ripped my skin open, creating a hole just large enough to reveal the insect they were attached to.

It struggled to emerge. The natural tension of my epidermis valiantly fought back against its birth. Eventually, though, it all came through. Head, thorax, wings, abdomen, stinger.

A paper wasp, almost identical to the one I had just mangled, had crawled out from the massive cyst.

As it flew away, my skin snapped shut. Then it appeared smooth and perfectly sealed, like nothing had crawled out of it in the first place. Numbed to the point of utter indifference, I was just glad the process didn‚Äôt hurt.

No pain at all, actually.

Just the twitching, and the writhing, and the tickling.

When I dragged my eyes from the mirror and back to the boot, lingering upright on the table like a tombstone, I came to terms with the origin of my regret.

In a sense, I had crushed my child.

\- - - - -

If you can believe it, the following few days were even¬†*more*¬†taxing on my body.

It started with an all-too familiar noise spilling from lips. The sound reminded me of her, and for whatever reason, the thought of her didn‚Äôt inspire as much terror in my stomach as it had in the days that lead up to that moment.

Like Bella, I was wheezing.

As I ran my fingertips down the side of my chest, the reason became clear. A few centimeters below my nipple, the skin, muscle, and bone were incrementally caving in, on both the left and right side of torso. Took about twenty-four hours for the process to be completed, but once the tissue had collapsed down to the edges of my spine, I imagine a generous portion of my lungs were being compressed in turn.

A byproduct of my devolution.

And although I comprehended what was causing me to wheeze, I didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†it was happening. But as I surveyed the paper-like nests that were rapidly springing up in every corner of my home, their inhabitants revealed the answer.

I was changing to look like my progeny, and, reciprocally, my progeny were starting to look a little like me.

They were larger than normal wasps - most coaster-sized or bigger. Some had splotches of human skin in places, as opposed to their usual yellow-brown carapace. Their legs were wider, almost the width of a pinky finger, and a few even had knuckles and fingernails. One of them retained their compound eyes, but all of them were human instead of insectoid; a kaleidoscopic array of hazel irises listlessly staring into the ether.

As for me, I was developing the demarcation between my thorax and my abdomen to match my progeny.

The scientific term for it, according to google, is a¬†*petiole.*¬†Honestly, though, I prefer the slang version of that;¬†*a*¬†*wasp waist*.

Initially, the separation was painful. The parts above my¬†*petiole*¬†lacked a sturdy foundation, twisting and straining the overworked muscles as I attempted to keep myself aligned properly. Thankfully, my progeny were grateful for their home, and they showed their gratitude by creating architecture to support my change. Without instruction, they flew into those gaps and erected beams made of chewed wood-fiber, filling in the empty space between my new upper and lower body.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked.

*Must have been what I accidentally punched through that day*, I thought, and that realization eventually brought my mind back to the cryptic letter.

*‚Äúonce mother, come find me‚Äù*

*How will I know*¬†***where***¬†*to find Bella? Certainly can‚Äôt step on the train looking like this.*

Again, my progeny provided.

Like a watermark on a photograph or the barcode on a bag of chips, each and every hive was built to have faint text imprinted on the outside of it.

No additional message; just an address of somewhere not too far from me.

Right now, I‚Äôm waiting for night to fall. Under the cover of darkness, I plan on traveling to that address to meet Bella. I expect it will be a one-way trip, though, so I‚Äôve spent the day typing this up.

Consider this post my last will and testament, which, in the end, boils down to a singular request.

Do not disturb my home; I‚Äôm leaving it to my progeny.

The sun has set completely.

Truthfully, I‚Äôm petrified, and I wish things were different.

Cameron, if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt call you. Tell Mom I‚Äôm sorry as well.

He manages to nap fine during the day, he‚Äôll quite happily let me crate him or he‚Äôll go on his own if I put him down from my lap, but this evening he really put up a fight to go in his crate. He‚Äôd been awake for about 4 hours, too long I know. In this time he‚Äôd had his dinner, gone for a short walk, been to the toilet a couple of times, and, actually quite nicely for a change, played with his blanket/toys rather than chewing the carpet or coffee table.

It was when he started obsessing with trying to get a something under the footstool (there was nothing there) that I realised he was overtired and needed to sleep. I scooped him up to put him in his crate, but when he realised where we were heading he started to wriggle like hell and snarl. As soon as he went in the crate he‚Äôd try to rush out unless I almost slammed the crate door shut on him; it‚Äôs a race as to whether he can get out or I can shut the door first. Yet as soon as the door was shut he didn‚Äôt make a fuss; I walked out the room and he was asleep within 30 seconds.

I‚Äôve never had much luck with love.

Not for lack of interest, mind you; always wanted a family of my own. I just don‚Äôt think the good lord created me with romance at the forefront of their blueprint, though. Me on a date is like taking a sedan off-roading. Sure, it can be done, but it ain‚Äôt graceful, nor is it really the point of that particular vehicle, and most people don‚Äôt elect to give it a second try after the first. They lease out a jeep instead.

A large part of it comes down to attraction. Simply put, I don‚Äôt think I'm most desirable bachelor.

I‚Äôm bulky; not obese per se, but I‚Äôm not exactly chiseled, either. Closer to Dionysos than Adonis in terms of body frame. Not only that, but I‚Äôm not much of a conversationist. Even if I was born with a silver tongue, I wouldn‚Äôt have much to speak on. Never had much fascination with pop culture, music or cinema; topics that most folk are well-versed in that can help break the ice.

No, my singular hobby has always been decidedly devoid of any and all sex-appeal, at least in my experience; woodworking.

What can I say? There‚Äôs just a certain satisfaction in handiwork that has always appealed to me. Not only that, but the act of creation can be meditative, like prayer. But unlike prayer, something actually comes of it in the end.

I suppose I appreciate the pursuit because it makes me feel useful, which is the best segue I can come up with to introduce Bella, the woman who sunk her canines into my back on the subway three weeks ago.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt know what her actual name is. The police don‚Äôt either, for that matter. In the months that led up to the assault, however, I‚Äôd started thinking of her as *""Bella""*. I was much too bashful to ask her real name, nor do I think it‚Äôs any man‚Äôs place to bother a young lady with unsolicited personal inquiries, but we interacted frequently enough where ‚Äú*there‚Äôs that beautiful Italian woman again*‚Äù felt a little impersonal, even if I was only saying it in my head.

It‚Äôs a touch pathetic, I know. I will point out that the name wasn't chosen on a whim. *""Bella""* seemed to capture her essence quite well, both the beauty of her person and the tragedy of her existence.

She was always wheezing.

Her lungs squeaked and huffed like a decade-old chewed-up dog toy, no matter what she was doing. Even when she was still, she'd wheeze. Bella was discrete about it, and she never seemed to be in distress, but I didn‚Äôt like the public‚Äôs indifference to her plight, regardless of her apparent control and stability.

Just because an amputee seems adept with their crutches, doesn't mean you don't look to help them where you can.

Saw her for the first time nine months ago. I stepped onto the metro to find that the seats were filled, somehow leaving Bella as the only one standing; audibly rasping while leaning her body against a pole. The seats weren‚Äôt even completely occupied by people, either; a small middle-aged man in a cheap suit was overflowing into¬†*both*¬†of his adjacent spaces. One seat for his tablet, another for the remains of his breakfast sandwich.

I‚Äôm not usually one to stick my neck where it doesn‚Äôt belong, but that didn‚Äôt sit right with me.

After some gentle cajoling on my part, the man relented and cleaned up his trash so Bella could sit. I could tell he was livid, but he didn‚Äôt argue either, probably on account of the size difference between me and him. While it was true that I‚Äôve probably taken shits that weighed more than that man on multiple occasions, I wouldn‚Äôt ever have hurt him. He didn‚Äôt know that, though. He likely interpreted my quiet disposition as a sign that I could be dangerous; things that are¬†*actually*¬†dangerous don‚Äôt need to be showy about it.

As Bella sat down, her wheezing slowed. She thanked me, and I could see in her warm brown eyes that she was happy to be off her feet.

I smiled, nodded my head, and that was it. Didn't try to talk to her. Didn't stare. As gorgeous as she was, I considered our business concluded.

When I departed the train at my stop about ten minutes later, I happened to notice that those warm brown eyes were following me off as well. Surprise at her ongoing interest blushed my face the color of a maraschino cherry, no doubt. Can‚Äôt imagine that was very becoming of me, either. It‚Äôs one thing when a handsome, Casanova-type blushes; the brightness just adds definition to their already perfect contours. Me though? Just doesn‚Äôt look right. No one wants to see Mr. Hyde blush.

Still, I‚Äôd be lying if I pretended like it didn‚Äôt pleasantly flutter my heart.

From that day on, Bella was already there when I hopped on the train for work. Picked up her things when she dropped them out of reach a few times. Helped her up when she tripped and fell once. We never talked, though, and I was perfectly content with that. I had no illusions about my position in the hierarchy, nor did I let myself fantasize like some sort of love-drunk teenager. Nothing wrong with that when you‚Äôre¬†*actually*¬†a teenager, but I haven‚Äôt been one of those in quite a long while.

Like with my woodworking, I was just happy to feel useful; when the opportunity arose, at least.

Bella perceived this desire in me, too, apparently.

I was exactly what she had been searching for.

\- - - - -

The pain was unreal, but somehow, the shock of it all was even worse. I didn‚Äôt even hear Bella approach until she was practically wheezing into my ear.

*‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre just perfect,‚Äù*¬†she murmured, words accented by the sharp hisses coming from her throat like she had swallowed a live cobra.

Before I could even begin to process that statement, an explosive pain detonated in my shoulder blade. It felt like thousands of serrated pins swirling aimlessly through my flesh, eviscerating my brittle nerves until they were barely intact enough to cry out anymore. Honestly, I thought someone had shot me.

I threw my hand around my back, looking to access the injury with my fingertips. There was something in the way, however. Whatever it was, the force of my movement broke through it with hardly any resistance, and my hand kept going until it crashed into something hot, sturdy, and pulsating.

There was a muffled whimper, vocalizations vibrating uncomfortably against my back, and the pain lessened. When I spun around, my mind struggled to comprehend what I saw.

Bella, smiling at me, revealing a mouth full of peg-shaped, overcrowded teeth that dripped with freshly liberated blood. I recall there were rows and rows of chalky white fangs that seemed to go on forever, deeper and deeper into her gullet, or at least I couldn't see where they stopped.

Hundreds of those grotesque molars had bitten straight through my jacket and undershirt.

As if that wasn't enough, there was also a massive cavity in the right side of her chest where my hand had connected. It was almost like Bella was rib-less, as my fingers had cleanly cut through her torso until it collided with¬†*some*¬†midline structure, tucking the fabric of her wispy sundress into the new crease in a way that made me instantly nauseous.

I‚Äôm strong, but I certainly wasn‚Äôt capable of caving in a woman‚Äôs chest without even trying.

At that point, another passenger was closing in behind Bella, arms outstretched to apprehend the maniac woman. With a motion that would have bordered on elegant if it wasn‚Äôt so starkly terrifying, she twisted her upper body and extended her spine, placing her palms onto the floor between the passenger‚Äôs legs. Her nails clawed at the metal, screeching as she skittered under the man on all fours without colliding into him. Before anyone else could react, Bella had slithered through the closing subway doors, barely clearing the narrow threshold before it shut completely.

And with that, she was gone. The train jerked and then began chugging forward. I glimpsed Bella through the window as we gained speed, crawling up the stairs, still on all fours.

In a state of silent disorientation, I slowly sat down on the floor, closed my eyes, lowered my head into my hands, and receded into myself.

Even then, I could tell that the pain was changing. The stabbing sensation waned; it was gradually being replaced by a feeling that was agonizing in a different, less physical way.

My wound tickled, writhed, and twitched.

\- - - - -

*‚ÄúSo, do you know who she is? Was she stalking me or something?‚Äù*¬†I asked the detective over the phone two days after the incident.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He paused, clicking his tongue.

*‚ÄúNot in the legal sense, no. She was clearly very‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶entranced with you.‚Äù*

Absurdly, he said nothing further; like¬†*that*¬†was a satisfactory answer to my question.

*‚ÄúI apologize, Sir, but could you kindly elaborate on what that means?‚Äù*

Another few clicks of his tongue, a handful of false starts with ‚Äú*Uhhs‚Äù*¬†that trailed off to nowhere, and then a minute later, he finally expanded on the notion of Bella being¬†*entranced with me.*¬†While I waited for the man to conjure some sort of explanation, I sifted through the day's mail.

Right before he started speaking, my eyes landed on a weathered envelope at the bottom of the pile. No return address. No stamp. Didn‚Äôt even have my name on it. In raggedy, child-like handwriting, it simply read:¬†*‚ÄúFor the nice man on the train.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe woman who bit you sat on the subway for about eighteen hours every day, without fail. Didn't eat, didn't drink. For the last ninety days, she did, at least. Transportation authority doesn‚Äôt hold CCTV footage for longer than three months,""*¬†he said.

My heart thundered wildly against my sternum as I pulled the crumpled message out of its envelope.

‚Äú*She didn‚Äôt move much. Would just kind of gaze out the window most of the day. But whenever you were on the train, she watched you like a hawk‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I hung up. Couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. It was too much all at one time.

My eyes scanned the note.

Twenty letters. Five words. Didn‚Äôt make a lick of sense.

*‚Äúonce mother, come find me‚Äù*

*- - - - -*

A week off of work helped at first. Kept my mind occupied with household chores. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt have to grapple with the possibility of encountering Bella on the train, a myriad of overlapping fangs jutting through her smile like stalactites on the roof of a cave. Home just felt safer.

There was an undeniable irrationality to that impression, though.

She had been at my house. Recently, too. The letter had clearly been hand delivered.

I ignored that inconsistency and immersed myself in the overdue handiwork. Cleaned out the gutters. Took a bus out to the nearest Home Depot to pick up some wasp spray for a new hive growing out of an open pipe in my basement. Attended to my vegetable garden.

All the while, the lump on my shoulder blade continued to grow.

It wasn‚Äôt much at first; just a marble-sized blister on the very tip of my scapula. If you examined it at just the right angle, the growth looked like it was the exact center of a circle established by the clusters of raw, peg-shaped bite marks surrounding it.

When it tripled in size overnight, I practically sprinted to the urgent care, which was only a few blocks away. The doctor didn‚Äôt seem too impressed by the lesion, which was a relief. That said, never in my life have I interacted with a health care professional that looked more dead behind the eyes. Through a series of grumbles, they informed me it was likely a bacterial abscess from the bite, but it was nothing a ten-day course of antibiotics couldn‚Äôt remedy.

Of course, the medicine didn‚Äôt do jackshit. How could it?

It wasn‚Äôt even targeting the type of thing that was germinating in that makeshift womb.

\- - - - -

By the end of the week, it felt as though a tangerine had been surgically implanted underneath my skin. Not only that, but I began experiencing other symptoms as well. My entire body felt swollen and heavy, like buckets of dense saltwater were sloshing around in my tissue with every movement. A dry, hacking cough took hold of me every few minutes. Despite getting nearly double my normal amount of sleep, I woke up every day groggy and debilitated by an unyielding malaise.

Wanted it to be the flu. At least, I wanted to¬†*convince*¬†myself that I was coming down with influenza. The alternative was far worse. A ticking metronome expanding under my shoulder blade made that illusion basically impossible to maintain, though.

My symptoms and the growth were clearly connected.

There wasn‚Äôt really pain around the bite anymore. Or, if there was, a more unexplainable feeling drowned it out. By then, the twitching, writhing sensation had become much louder and unsettlingly rhythmic; a swarm of microscopic firecrackers imploding inside the confines of that cyst every five seconds, like clockwork. It was much worse at night, but a double dose of my before-bed sleep aid brought unconsciousness deep enough to afford me brief respite from the sensation.

Until one evening when I could ignore it no longer.

\- - - - -

The sun had just started to crest under the horizon, casting curtains of dim light into my home; the decaying shadows of an unlit room embraced by a withering twilight. I was pacing furiously around my first floor, at my wit's end with the sensation and contemplating what to do next, shirt off since the fabric of my flannel was irritating the growth. At the same time, I was attempting to keep a simmering panic attack from completely taking over. No matter which way I looked at the situation, though, my mind kept arriving at the same answer.

Might be time for the hospital.

When I finally accepted that was the only reasonable course of action, it had become too dark to see, and I felt liable to trip over furniture as I gathered my coat and wallet. Cautiously, I found my way to a lamp and flicked it on. The presence of something unexpected on the armrest of my couch, in synergy with my frenzied state, startled me to high heaven, causing my heart to leap into my throat.

A paper wasp was buzzing quietly over the upholstery.

Now, under normal circumstances, I‚Äôm not a hot-tempered person. But, at that moment, I wasn‚Äôt quite myself. A volatile mixture of sleep deprivation, panic, and fear coursed through my veins. In truth, I was a Molotov cocktail anxiously waiting for the match; primed and ready to burn.

The spark of adrenaline that came with being surprised was enough to ignite the dormant rage inside me.

I stomped over to the hallway closet, swung the door open with such force that its doorknob dented the adjacent wall as it slammed against the plaster, and grabbed my heaviest work boots by the pull-strap. At that point, the wasp had meandered over to the surface of my coffee table, calm and wholly unaware of its imminent demise. Wide eyed and boiling, I ran towards the creature and brought the heel down on its fragile body like an executioner. A sickening, chitinous crunch radiated up my arm. As it did, my rage seemingly vanished; dissipated instantly, like the details of a dream quickly drifting away after waking.

In the absence of anger, I felt a terrible, heart-wrenching regret. A profound sadness that I had absolutely no explanation for.

When my eye glimpsed movement on my back in a nearby mirror, though, I began to understand. A gradual, tortuous realization that defied explanation.

In stunned horror, I watched a pair of tiny wriggling thorns sprout from the flesh of my growth. Twitching. Writhing. After extending about a half inch above the surface, they ripped my skin open, creating a hole just large enough to reveal the insect they were attached to.

It struggled to emerge. The natural tension of my epidermis valiantly fought back against its birth. Eventually, though, it all came through. Head, thorax, wings, abdomen, stinger.

A paper wasp, almost identical to the one I had just mangled, had crawled out from the massive cyst.

As it flew away, my skin snapped shut. Then it appeared smooth and perfectly sealed, like nothing had crawled out of it in the first place. Numbed to the point of utter indifference, I was just glad the process didn‚Äôt hurt.

No pain at all, actually.

Just the twitching, and the writhing, and the tickling.

When I dragged my eyes from the mirror and back to the boot, lingering upright on the table like a tombstone, I came to terms with the origin of my regret.

In a sense, I had crushed my child.

\- - - - -

If you can believe it, the following few days were even¬†*more*¬†taxing on my body.

It started with an all-too familiar noise spilling from lips. The sound reminded me of her, and for whatever reason, the thought of her didn‚Äôt inspire as much terror in my stomach as it had in the days that lead up to that moment.

Like Bella, I was wheezing.

As I ran my fingertips down the side of my chest, the reason became clear. A few centimeters below my nipple, the skin, muscle, and bone were incrementally caving in, on both the left and right side of torso. Took about twenty-four hours for the process to be completed, but once the tissue had collapsed down to the edges of my spine, I imagine a generous portion of my lungs were being compressed in turn.

A byproduct of my devolution.

And although I comprehended what was causing me to wheeze, I didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†it was happening. But as I surveyed the paper-like nests that were rapidly springing up in every corner of my home, their inhabitants revealed the answer.

I was changing to look like my progeny, and, reciprocally, my progeny were starting to look a little like me.

They were larger than normal wasps - most coaster-sized or bigger. Some had splotches of human skin in places, as opposed to their usual yellow-brown carapace. Their legs were wider, almost the width of a pinky finger, and a few even had knuckles and fingernails. One of them retained their compound eyes, but all of them were human instead of insectoid; a kaleidoscopic array of hazel irises listlessly staring into the ether.

As for me, I was developing the demarcation between my thorax and my abdomen to match my progeny.

The scientific term for it, according to google, is a¬†*petiole.*¬†Honestly, though, I prefer the slang version of that;¬†*a*¬†*wasp waist*.

Initially, the separation was painful. The parts above my¬†*petiole*¬†lacked a sturdy foundation, twisting and straining the overworked muscles as I attempted to keep myself aligned properly. Thankfully, my progeny were grateful for their home, and they showed their gratitude by creating architecture to support my change. Without instruction, they flew into those gaps and erected beams made of chewed wood-fiber, filling in the empty space between my new upper and lower body.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked.

*Must have been what I accidentally punched through that day*, I thought, and that realization eventually brought my mind back to the cryptic letter.

*‚Äúonce mother, come find me‚Äù*

*How will I know*¬†***where***¬†*to find Bella? Certainly can‚Äôt step on the train looking like this.*

Again, my progeny provided.

Like a watermark on a photograph or the barcode on a bag of chips, each and every hive was built to have faint text imprinted on the outside of it.

No additional message; just an address of somewhere not too far from me.

Right now, I‚Äôm waiting for night to fall. Under the cover of darkness, I plan on traveling to that address to meet Bella. I expect it will be a one-way trip, though, so I‚Äôve spent the day typing this up.

Consider this post my last will and testament, which, in the end, boils down to a singular request.

Do not disturb my home; I‚Äôm leaving it to my progeny.

\- - - - -

The sun has set completely.

Truthfully, I‚Äôm petrified, and I wish things were different.

Cameron, if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt call you. Tell Mom I‚Äôm sorry as well.

Know that, although I‚Äôm resigned to this fate, there is a glimmer of beauty in it for me.

I‚Äôll be with Bella.

It wasn‚Äôt much at first; just a marble-sized blister on the very tip of my scapula. If you examined it at just the right angle, the growth looked like it was the exact center of a circle established by the clusters of raw, peg-shaped bite marks surrounding it.

When it tripled in size overnight, I practically sprinted to the urgent care, which was only a few blocks away. The doctor didn‚Äôt seem too impressed by the lesion, which was a relief. That said, never in my life have I interacted with a health care professional that looked more dead behind the eyes. Through a series of grumbles, they informed me it was likely a bacterial abscess from the bite, but it was nothing a ten-day course of antibiotics couldn‚Äôt remedy.

Of course, the medicine didn‚Äôt do jackshit. How could it?

It wasn‚Äôt even targeting the type of thing that was germinating in that makeshift womb.

\- - - - -

By the end of the week, it felt as though a tangerine had been surgically implanted underneath my skin. Not only that, but I began experiencing other symptoms as well. My entire body felt swollen and heavy, like buckets of dense saltwater were sloshing around in my tissue with every movement. A dry, hacking cough took hold of me every few minutes. Despite getting nearly double my normal amount of sleep, I woke up every day groggy and debilitated by an unyielding malaise.

Wanted it to be the flu. At least, I wanted to¬†*convince*¬†myself that I was coming down with influenza. The alternative was far worse. A ticking metronome expanding under my shoulder blade made that illusion basically impossible to maintain, though.

My symptoms and the growth were clearly connected.

There wasn‚Äôt really pain around the bite anymore. Or, if there was, a more unexplainable feeling drowned it out. By then, the twitching, writhing sensation had become much louder and unsettlingly rhythmic; a swarm of microscopic firecrackers imploding inside the confines of that cyst every five seconds, like clockwork. It was much worse at night, but a double dose of my before-bed sleep aid brought unconsciousness deep enough to afford me brief respite from the sensation.

Until one evening when I could ignore it no longer.

\- - - - -

The sun had just started to crest under the horizon, casting curtains of dim light into my home; the decaying shadows of an unlit room embraced by a withering twilight. I was pacing furiously around my first floor, at my wit's end with the sensation and contemplating what to do next, shirt off since the fabric of my flannel was irritating the growth. At the same time, I was attempting to keep a simmering panic attack from completely taking over. No matter which way I looked at the situation, though, my mind kept arriving at the same answer.

Might be time for the hospital.

When I finally accepted that was the only reasonable course of action, it had become too dark to see, and I felt liable to trip over furniture as I gathered my coat and wallet. Cautiously, I found my way to a lamp and flicked it on. The presence of something unexpected on the armrest of my couch, in synergy with my frenzied state, startled me to high heaven, causing my heart to leap into my throat.

A paper wasp was buzzing quietly over the upholstery.

Now, under normal circumstances, I‚Äôm not a hot-tempered person. But, at that moment, I wasn‚Äôt quite myself. A volatile mixture of sleep deprivation, panic, and fear coursed through my veins. In truth, I was a Molotov cocktail anxiously waiting for the match; primed and ready to burn.

The spark of adrenaline that came with being surprised was enough to ignite the dormant rage inside me.

I stomped over to the hallway closet, swung the door open with such force that its doorknob dented the adjacent wall as it slammed against the plaster, and grabbed my heaviest work boots by the pull-strap. At that point, the wasp had meandered over to the surface of my coffee table, calm and wholly unaware of its imminent demise. Wide eyed and boiling, I ran towards the creature and brought the heel down on its fragile body like an executioner. A sickening, chitinous crunch radiated up my arm. As it did, my rage seemingly vanished; dissipated instantly, like the details of a dream quickly drifting away after waking.

In the absence of anger, I felt a terrible, heart-wrenching regret. A profound sadness that I had absolutely no explanation for.

When my eye glimpsed movement on my back in a nearby mirror, though, I began to understand. A gradual, tortuous realization that defied explanation.

In stunned horror, I watched a pair of tiny wriggling thorns sprout from the flesh of my growth. Twitching. Writhing. After extending about a half inch above the surface, they ripped my skin open, creating a hole just large enough to reveal the insect they were attached to.

It struggled to emerge. The natural tension of my epidermis valiantly fought back against its birth. Eventually, though, it all came through. Head, thorax, wings, abdomen, stinger.

A paper wasp, almost identical to the one I had just mangled, had crawled out from the massive cyst.

As it flew away, my skin snapped shut. Then it appeared smooth and perfectly sealed, like nothing had crawled out of it in the first place. Numbed to the point of utter indifference, I was just glad the process didn‚Äôt hurt.

No pain at all, actually.

Just the twitching, and the writhing, and the tickling.

When I dragged my eyes from the mirror and back to the boot, lingering upright on the table like a tombstone, I came to terms with the origin of my regret.

In a sense, I had crushed my child.

\- - - - -

If you can believe it, the following few days were even¬†*more*¬†taxing on my body.

It started with an all-too familiar noise spilling from lips. The sound reminded me of her, and for whatever reason, the thought of her didn‚Äôt inspire as much terror in my stomach as it had in the days that lead up to that moment.

Like Bella, I was wheezing.

As I ran my fingertips down the side of my chest, the reason became clear. A few centimeters below my nipple, the skin, muscle, and bone were incrementally caving in, on both the left and right side of torso. Took about twenty-four hours for the process to be completed, but once the tissue had collapsed down to the edges of my spine, I imagine a generous portion of my lungs were being compressed in turn.

A byproduct of my devolution.

And although I comprehended what was causing me to wheeze, I didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†it was happening. But as I surveyed the paper-like nests that were rapidly springing up in every corner of my home, their inhabitants revealed the answer.

I was changing to look like my progeny, and, reciprocally, my progeny were starting to look a little like me.

They were larger than normal wasps - most coaster-sized or bigger. Some had splotches of human skin in places, as opposed to their usual yellow-brown carapace. Their legs were wider, almost the width of a pinky finger, and a few even had knuckles and fingernails. One of them retained their compound eyes, but all of them were human instead of insectoid; a kaleidoscopic array of hazel irises listlessly staring into the ether.

As for me, I was developing the demarcation between my thorax and my abdomen to match my progeny.

The scientific term for it, according to google, is a¬†*petiole.*¬†Honestly, though, I prefer the slang version of that;¬†*a*¬†*wasp waist*.

Initially, the separation was painful. The parts above my¬†*petiole*¬†lacked a sturdy foundation, twisting and straining the overworked muscles as I attempted to keep myself aligned properly. Thankfully, my progeny were grateful for their home, and they showed their gratitude by creating architecture to support my change. Without instruction, they flew into those gaps and erected beams made of chewed wood-fiber, filling in the empty space between my new upper and lower body.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked.

*Must have been what I accidentally punched through that day*, I thought, and that realization eventually brought my mind back to the cryptic letter.

*‚Äúonce mother, come find me‚Äù*

*How will I know*¬†***where***¬†*to find Bella? Certainly can‚Äôt step on the train looking like this.*

Again, my progeny provided.

Like a watermark on a photograph or the barcode on a bag of chips, each and every hive was built to have faint text imprinted on the outside of it.

No additional message; just an address of somewhere not too far from me.

Right now, I‚Äôm waiting for night to fall. Under the cover of darkness, I plan on traveling to that address to meet Bella. I expect it will be a one-way trip, though, so I‚Äôve spent the day typing this up.

Consider this post my last will and testament, which, in the end, boils down to a singular request.

Do not disturb my home; I‚Äôm leaving it to my progeny.

\- - - - -

The sun has set completely.

Truthfully, I‚Äôm petrified, and I wish things were different.

Cameron, if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt call you. Tell Mom I‚Äôm sorry as well.

Know that, although I‚Äôm resigned to this fate, there is a glimmer of beauty in it for me.

I‚Äôll be with Bella.

I was raised with love, room to be myself and always say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù when we leave (to go literally anywhere). Up until Covid, my mom was a nurse and dabbled in politics (watching FOX), she mostly kept to herself with comments/concerns and so on unless it was a presidential race (from what I recall). Well since being back in the same town as her and my father, she has absolutely spiraled into what my dad calls her ‚Äúrabbit hole‚Äù, she is almost ALWAYS on X/Twitter listening to Spaces (the community groups of live chats) and commenting prolifically on anything and everything.  

We have had our disagreements and discussions in the past (note to add: I don‚Äôt really talk about MY specific views, more just general opinions and comments on a said subject), some she has gotten heated by and really puts her foot down. I think it was 2022-2023 she was in DEEP with medicine, not trusting doctors/hospitals, stocking up on prepping supplies, making sure that everyone knew ‚Äúthey‚Äù were putting microchips and bug skeletons in our foods, chemtrails, the sun explosions and how they effect the environment/magnetic pull of the earth and so on. (Note to add: it‚Äôs not that everything she tells me is totally OUT OF THIS WORLD, but as I have expressed to her, it makes my anxiety spike and sends me into a spiral ‚Äî‚Äî- Verbatim what I have told her ‚ÄúI do not want the burden of the world on my shoulders. I cannot fix the world, and I do not appreciate the pressure you put on me‚Äù (I have told her to is COUNTLESS times)‚Ä¶. 

This now brings us to this AM, I was having coffee at their house with them, like I do almost every day, we catch up on little things, help them with technology or do the NYT daily games together. She mentioned about bills being passed in our state and how she was watching a video about what the next installment of them was and how I should be using X/Twitter to respond to my legislators and emailing them to oppose it. I explained that I wasnt totally confident in what exactly she was talking and my X account isn‚Äôt very political, sometimes I see something about the president or MAJOR major news, but otherwise its the one place I do not have family on for this very reason. I use it for my personal interests and ‚Äúbrain rotting‚Äù (I don‚Äôt have TikTok, Instagram or Snapchat). She then told me that because I don‚Äôt use my platform to be proactive I am just a part of the machine. I am part of the reason why stuff doesn‚Äôt lean ‚Äúour‚Äù way politically. I just shut down and scrolled on my phone. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. She is ALWAYS on her phone, listening to or being an active participant in these things. My dad watches news, but is in the same boat as me, life has to continue on and we refuse to be stuck in this hole üï≥Ô∏è that she is on a daily basis. 

I have started going on walks without my phone, working on my yard and garden but it really hurts my heart that she can‚Äôt just let things be or let people think what they want. It‚Äôs not the woman I know and who I used to talk about EVERYTHING to. I now have to think carefully about what I can/want to bring up with her because it usually gets turned into some political, religious or all of the above. I try to keep things short or on a lighthearted subject.

I‚Äôm a 46- year-old guy who believes that life is a sitcom, and I‚Äôm just looking for the perfect co-star to join my hilarious episodes! üòÑ

1. **Witty Banter**: My sarcasm is sharper than my cooking skills, which, let‚Äôs be honest, are only slightly better than instant ramen.
2. **Adventures Galore**: Whether it‚Äôs hiking up a mountain or finding the best taco truck in town, I‚Äôm all about making memories (and probably getting us lost along the way)! üåÆ
3. **Snack Enthusiast**: I believe no movie night is complete without popcorn and possibly an embarrassing array of candy. (Ah, the sweet taste of regret!) üç¨

What I‚Äôm looking for:
- Someone who can appreciate a well-timed pun and isn‚Äôt afraid to unleash their inner goofball.
- A partner who loves to explore new coffee shops and can tolerate my need for extra whipped cream. ‚òï
- A fellow adventurer who‚Äôs ready to dive into spontaneous road trips and late-night debates about whether pineapple belongs on pizza. (Spoiler: it does!)

Hey Lacey,

I‚Äôm having a bad day. One of those where nothing goes right. I spilled coffee on my shirt. I forgot to refill my transit card and I had to stand awkwardly to the side fiddling with my phone while the rest of the line shuffled onto the bus. I couldn‚Äôt figure out the problem at work. I‚Äôm behind on my things, and I need to call my mom more often.

I wanted to cry all day. I wanted to collapse. To break down. But I stayed strong. I knew you‚Äôd have believed in me. And when I came home, I sat in a ball against the front door and bawled.

I hugged your dresses. In the closet. I don‚Äôt know how long they‚Äôre gonna keep smelling like you.

When it comes to Mediterranean cuisine, few destinations offer the rich diversity and vibrant flavors of Cyprus. This sun-soaked island, nestled between Europe, Asia, and Africa, boasts a culinary heritage shaped by centuries of cultural influences‚ÄîGreek, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and even British. From hearty village dishes to fresh seafood pulled straight from the azure waters, Cyprus food is a delightful fusion that promises something for every palate. If you‚Äôre planning a trip or simply curious about what to savor, let‚Äôs dive into the must-try dishes and flavors that define Cypriot cuisine, as inspired by this [comprehensive guide](https://cyprusvoyage.com/cyprus-food-what-to-eat-in-cyprus/).

**The Heart of Cypriot Cuisine**

At the core of Cyprus food is its emphasis on fresh, local ingredients. Olive oil flows generously, herbs like oregano and mint perfume the air, and cheeses like halloumi‚Äîgrilled to salty, squeaky perfection‚Äîsteal the show. One bite of a traditional meze, a sprawling array of small dishes served as a meal, and you‚Äôll understand why Cypriot dining is as much about community as it is about taste. Expect staples like souvlakia (grilled meat skewers), tangy tzatziki, and warm pita bread to kick things off.

**Iconic Dishes You Can‚Äôt Miss**

No exploration of Cyprus food is complete without tasting **halloumi**, the island‚Äôs famous semi-soft cheese that‚Äôs equally delicious grilled, fried, or raw. Pair it with a glass of Commandaria, a sweet dessert wine with roots tracing back to the Crusades. For meat lovers, **sheftalia**‚Äîsausage-like parcels of minced meat wrapped in caul fat‚Äîoffer a juicy, flavorful bite, often enjoyed with a side of village salad bursting with tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta.

Seafood shines here too, thanks to Cyprus‚Äôs coastal bounty. Try **calamari** or **octopus stifado**, a slow-cooked stew with red wine and onions that melts in your mouth. Vegetarians will adore **loukoumades**, fluffy dough balls drizzled with honey, or **kolokasi**, a taro root dish unique to the island‚Äôs culinary repertoire.

**Sweets and Street Eats**

Cypriot desserts are a sugary celebration of tradition. **Loukoumi** (Cyprus‚Äôs take on Turkish delight) comes in rose, lemon, or bergamot flavors, while **daktyla**‚Äîfinger-shaped pastries filled with almonds and cinnamon‚Äîpair perfectly with a strong Cypriot coffee. On the streets, vendors hawk **koulouri**, sesame-crusted bread rings, ideal for a quick snack as you explore bustling markets or quaint villages.

**Why Cyprus Food Stands Out**

What sets Cypriot cuisine apart is its ability to blend simplicity with sophistication. Whether it‚Äôs the smoky aroma of charcoal-grilled meats or the zest of citrus in every dish, the food reflects the island‚Äôs laid-back yet passionate spirit. It‚Äôs a cuisine born from the land and sea, seasoned with history, and served with a warm smile‚Äîa true taste of Mediterranean life.

So, whether you‚Äôre strolling through Paphos or lounging in Larnaca, let your taste buds guide you through Cyprus‚Äôs culinary treasures. This island‚Äôs food isn‚Äôt just a meal; it‚Äôs an experience that lingers long after the last bite.",1,1741978819.0,DiscoverCyprus,0,1.0,False

May I have your attention, please?"" Kokichi announced two weeks later from the lawn of Casa V3. All the students from Hope House, 7th Island House, and Casa V3 worked together to arrange chairs outside. Monokuma and Usami had set up a large movie screen to watch Kokichi and Himiko's anime on. Kirumi, Teruteru, and Celeste had set up a table of delicious food, desserts, soft drinks, and coffee or tea. All the students were now sitting quietly as they listened to Kokichi and Himiko, who were standing in front of the large movie screen.



¬†

 ¬†""We'd like to thank everyone who made this anime possible!"" Kokichi said.¬†





¬† ¬†""Nyeh...that's right,"" Himiko said. ""Without you guys, Kokichi would still be sulking in his room.""





¬† ¬†""Heeey!"" Kokichi said with a frown. A set of chuckles rippled through the crowd of students.





¬† ""Sorry,"" Himiko apologized.¬†





¬† ¬†""And now, the only thing keeping us from enjoying this anime is a long, boring speech,"" Kokichi continued. ""So, sit tight, sit back and relax, and enjoooyyy..."" He suddenly paused, then whispered to Himiko. Himiko's mouth opened and closed frantically before whispering back to him.





¬† ¬†""Ahhh, babe! I like that!"" he said with a big smile. Then, he turned back to the audience. ""Please enjoy the anime Himiko and I created:¬†*'Marbrawl!'*¬†First, we'll watch the live-action version, then we'll watch it the way it was meant to be watched in anime form, thanks to Chihiro's editing skills!"" The students cheered and applauded. Chihiro smiled modestly. Kokichi and Himiko then took their seats on two chairs in the front row.¬†





¬† ¬†""Movie projector, on!"" Monokuma said, then flicked a tiny switch. The movie projector's light flickered, then shone brightly on the screen with the usual countdown from three filling the screen before the show began. Sayaka's voice filled the air as the opening credits began.¬†





¬† ¬†""That's me!! Oh, my gosh!! That's me!! That's me!! That's me!!"" Sayaka gasped with hushed excitement. Kaede and Ibuki giggled and patted her on the her shoulders. The students murmured with amazement at how smooth the transitions of the scenes was and how in sync they were with the music.





¬† ¬†""HEY!! THAT WAS ME!! I SAW ME!!"" Kaito shouted. ""DID YOU SEE ME, MAKI ROLL?!""





¬† ¬†""Yes, I saw, now hush,"" Maki replied. Finally, the scene started with Kokichi walking through a darkened alleyway until he saw a mysterious old lady drop a doll that looked like Himiko. Celeste smiled proudly when she saw the old lady.





¬† ¬†""Hmhmhm...it is very interesting seeing myself on screen...and as an old woman, no less,"" she said. As the show went on, Kokichi sneaked a peek across the row of chairs. Gonta was sitting at the end. Next to him was Tsumugi, who was laying down on a gurney all wrapped-up like a mummy, save for one eye. She was peeking through her bandages at the show with only one eye. Seeing how excited everyone else was to be on screen made her eye water. Suddenly, she burst into tears.





¬† ""Awww, you okay, Tsumugi?"" Gonta asked sympathetically. ""You hungry?"" Tsumugi continued to cry, her sobs sounding like a constipated mummy. Gonta patted her shoulder gently. ""You no have to worry, Tsumugi. You be able to eat solid foods again someday!"" Kokichi snickered to himself before turning his attention back to the show.





¬† ¬†\*\*\*





¬† A few weeks later, Tsumugi had healed completely. She stomped over to Kokichi and Gonta's room and knocked on the door. Kokichi answered the door with a smirk once he saw Tsumugi.¬†





¬† ¬†""Yeeeees...?"" he asked, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed in a smug manner.¬†





¬† ¬†""If I...ap-p-ologize to your cousin, will you let me be in your next anime?"" she growled through gritted teeth.





¬† ¬†""You don't have to do that. Besides, Himiko and I aren't going to make another one,"" Kokichi replied. ""And if you¬†*really*¬†felt bad, you'd apologize to Chibi-Kichi without expecting something in return. But, you don't, sooo...why are you here?"" Tsumugi clenched her fists in and out as she tried to control her anger. Tears formed in her eyes.





¬† ""I-I...had the opportunity...to be in something...that I really loved...and you j-just...plainly took it away!!"" she gasped. Kokichi rolled his eyes.





¬† ¬†""Tsumugi, get real,"" he said. ""There's more to life than anime, y'know. You literally had to have your spine ripped out of you and replaced with a new one! Don't you care about that?""

¬†



¬†¬†""NO!!"" Tsumugi snapped. ""Anime...and manga...and cosplay are my whole reasons for existing!! As long as I can be a part of those things, I'm happy!!"" Kokichi shook his head.





¬† ¬†""Tsk, tsk, tsk...well, it sucks to be you, then,"" he said. ""If you care about all that more than your own well-being, I think I did the right thing by not letting you be part of our anime.""





¬† ¬†""Oh, yeah?! Then why did¬†*you*¬†do it in the first place?!"" Tsumugi snapped. ""Himiko said if it weren't for everyone helping you, you would have been in your room sulking still! So, ha!""





¬† ¬†""Yeah, well, unlike¬†*you*, I would have gotten over it eventually,"" Kokichi said. ""And, you know what? Instead of¬†*wallowing in self-pity*, I took action and created an anime with Himiko. If this was soooo important to you, maybe you should do the same.""





¬† ¬†""I don't think I will, since¬†*you*¬†suggested it,"" Tsumugi said. ""I have¬†*more*¬†important things to do."" Kokichi rolled his eyes so far into the back of his head.





¬† ¬†""Whatevs,"" he muttered. ""Are we done now?""





¬† ¬†""Hmph!"" Tsumugi flipped her hair at Kokichi, then walked away. After one last eyeroll, he shut the door.¬†





¬† ¬†""Nyeh...was that Tsumugi?"" Himiko asked. She was sitting on Kokichi's bed. Leaning on his arm, Kokichi took his place next to her and grabbed his game controller.





¬† ¬†""Unfortunately,"" he muttered. ""But, she's gone, and that's all that matters to me!""





¬† ¬†""I hope she's not too mad,"" Himiko said. Kokichi scoffed.





¬† ¬†""Pffft! Who cares? She's a big-ass baby who needs to get over herself. If she wasn't such an elitist weeb piece of shit, maybe I would have let her be in our anime.""¬†





¬† ¬†""Are we seriously not going to make another one?"" Himiko asked. Kokichi gave her a strange smile.





¬† ¬†""Why? Would you want to?"" he asked.





¬† ¬†""No. It was fun, but it was¬†*definitely*¬†a one-time thing.""





¬† ¬†""Yeah, well...I'm glad I did it with you, HimiCocoa Bean,"" Kokichi said, giving Himiko a playful nudge. ""It was pretty fun."" Himiko blushed.





¬† ¬†""Aw, Kokichi,"" she cooed. Kokichi chuckled and gave her a kiss on her neck before turning his attention back to his video game. Himiko leaned her head contently on Kokichi's as she watched him play in silence.¬†

A good alternative IMO would be to ""sell"" the gift card to a fellow Canadian for less than the true value ($15 or $20 for example) and then use the proceeds to purchase a Canadian product.

I think selling a USA gift card like this makes the most sense. The purchaser ensures that the gift card is used (best option) while getting a deal on the transaction ($5-$10 discount). The seller offsets the transaction by spending on a Canadian company which would not have happened otherwise.

When I was a teenager, there was an old-school coffeehouse near my house that opened from dusk until dawn, serving nothing but French press coffee and **culture**. For the price of a coffee, you could read, discuss, debate, perform, or simply be present as culture was spontaneously created around you. It was a communal space, unstructured and informal, where culture wasn‚Äôt consumed passively so much as it was actively created, experienced, and exchanged by neighbours. It was a local space for locals, reflecting our lives, voices, and values.

Here in North Vancouver (and *particularly* in these times), it might seem we have ample ‚Äò*culture*‚Äô: theaters, museums, community centers with scheduled activities. But what we often mistake for culture is merely its surface: the formalized *performance* of culture. Real culture, the kind that binds communities, strengthens shared values, and fosters genuine solidarity, isn‚Äôt something you just attend; it‚Äôs something you actively co-create. It emerges organically through spontaneous human interaction, genuine connection, conversation, shared creativity, and collaboration. It can‚Äôt simply be scheduled, regulated, or ticketed. It requires spaces that allow culture to form naturally, spaces that are currently absent or severely restricted in our city.

Our city‚Äôs bylaws on *Patron Participation Entertainment* (PPE), perhaps unintentionally, create significant barriers to this organic form of culture. When a coffee shop or bookstore wants to host an acoustic musician, a poet, or even a DJ spinning records quietly in the corner, they‚Äôre confronted by bureaucratic licensing and substantial financial hurdles ($144/day fees, additional insurance, etc.), requirements intended for establishments serving alcohol. These disproportionate demands not only impose an unnecessary burden on small, community-oriented businesses but actively discourage them from becoming genuine hubs of cultural creation and exchange, where our local identity can be preserved and nurtured.

I fear that without spaces dedicated explicitly to the casual, spontaneous creation of local cultural expression, we risk losing our identity altogether, replaced instead by a digital monoculture: flattened, curated by algorithms, and devoid of real human connection. Culture thrives in physical artifacts and experiences, like books passed hand-to-hand, art created by neighbors, music performed spontaneously, not just on or for the algorithm-driven platforms. It‚Äôs in these *physical expressions*, these tangible moments, that we find true **solidarity** and **connection**, essential ingredients for a vibrant community and genuine resistance to cultural erasure.

I‚Äôve reached out to the CNV Bylaw team multiple times to discuss this but received no response. So now, I‚Äôm bringing this conversation directly to the community: **what would it take to foster authentic spaces where North Vancouver culture can emerge and thrive?** How can we reshape our bylaws to encourage and not restrict the creation of *real cultural artifacts and experiences?*

I‚Äôd love your thoughts, ideas, and visions for how we can restore a genuinely local, participatory cultural landscape right here in our city.",12,1741978587.0,NorthVancouver,4,0.83,False

* **Second wave coffee** is all about mass-market expansion, darker roasts, and espresso-based drinks (think Starbucks, Peet‚Äôs, and coffee as an experience rather than just caffeine).

### 1. **Prioritize Protein to Curb Cravings and Boost Metabolism**  
Protein is a powerhouse nutrient for weight loss. Studies show it increases satiety, reduces hunger hormones, and boosts calorie burning through its high thermic effect. Aim to include **20‚Äì30 grams of protein per meal** from sources like eggs, lean meats, Greek yogurt, or plant-based options like lentils.  

**Pro Tip:** Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast to avoid mid-morning snacking. Pair it with fiber (e.g., veggies or whole grains) for sustained energy.  

---

### 2. **Leverage Intermittent Fasting (IF) for Effortless Calorie Control**  
Intermittent fasting, such as the 16:8 method (fasting for 16 hours, eating within an 8-hour window), helps regulate insulin levels and promotes fat burning. Research suggests IF can reduce calorie intake by **up to 30%** without strict dieting.  

**How to Start:** Skip breakfast and eat your first meal at noon, finishing dinner by 8 PM. Stay hydrated with water, herbal tea, or black coffee during fasting periods.  

---

### 3. **Swap Sugary Drinks for Hydration Heroes**  
Liquid calories from sodas, juices, and sugary coffees sabotage weight loss. Replace them with **water, green tea, or infused detox drinks**. Green tea, for instance, contains catechins that enhance fat oxidation by 17% according to studies.  

**Bonus Hack:** Drink a glass of water 15 minutes before meals to reduce portion sizes naturally.  

---

### 4. **Incorporate HIIT Workouts for Maximum Fat Burn**  
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) burns more calories in less time compared to steady-state cardio. Just 20‚Äì30 minutes of HIIT, 3‚Äì4 times weekly, can accelerate fat loss while preserving muscle mass.  

**Sample Routine:** Alternate 30 seconds of sprinting or burpees with 1 minute of walking. Repeat for 15‚Äì20 minutes.  

---

### Conclusion: Unlock Long-Term Success  
Weight loss is a journey, not a sprint. By combining these science-backed hacks‚Äîprotein prioritization, intermittent fasting, smart hydration, and HIIT‚Äîyou‚Äôll create sustainable habits that yield lasting results.

No serious problems in our marriage thus far. I've been struggling with some health issues, exhaustion, and surgery so I'm not always in the best mood (I will admit). I'm pretty burnt out in general with life, work, etc. Normal things. My husband hasn't been as loving, or physical the last few weeks and I'm contributing partly to my bad mood, but also I feel like he's been pulling away and withholding attention, which has my mood worse. Last night, my husband said he was doing an ""experiment"" in February. Basically saying he noticed the only thing I did for him was make him a cup of coffee one time. That he does things for me all the time, but I don't for him. I am not sure how to navigate this and don't typically keep tabs or take tally on who is doing more. Especially since we are so busy with work, raising young children, etc. Maybe I am doing something wrong and not seeing the situation clearly. I will say this hurt my feelings when he said he was doing an experiment and kind of threw me off. Especially when just last week, I told him I was struggling with mental health.

1jbb51e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jbb51e/aita_for_not_contributing_to_the_parties_my/,AITA for not contributing to the parties my coworker throws.,"I have a coworker who like to throw little parties at work at least once or twice every month. The parties are usually themed around holidays like St Patricks or Valentines but sometimes its more of silly holidays like Rubber ducky day or talk like a pirate day. The point is its numerous and often unexpected. The coworker in question goes all out too, decorations, food, drinks, supplies, etc. She also loves to run around our office and make sure we got some of the food that was brought in. The other day I overheard her complaining about how no one ever gives her money for these celebrations even though she's never asked for help with these parties. 

Besides these parties that shes constantly throwing, my office manager on a quarterly basis also goes around the office to organize potlucks. Those parties are usually funded from the office party fund and any other food thats brought in is pre arranged by everyone in the office. So we do have parties pretty often for office morale and any additional treats that are brought are usually ""just because"" treats from coworkers who wanted to do something nice. 

My issue is that I participate in all the potluck parties and every once in a while I also bring in donuts and coffee, etc and I just cant be throwing her money everytime she wants to celebrate the anniversary of the moon landing. She's a nice person and I appreciate the thought but I feel like these are things that she takes upon herself and cant just expect people to help pay her to do it. Am I wrong in this situation? I want to stop eating any of the food that she brings in if I'm not going to contribute but she's often left with a ton of food and it makes her upset when no one participates.

I‚Äôll admit: I used to say this all the time when I was younger. It's overblown but to some extent, it‚Äôs true ‚Äî there aren't enough events for young people compared to San Francisco. But honestly, I wish I spent less time complaining when I was younger and more time trying to fix the problem.¬†

If you have a cool, creative hobby, ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs there a way I can turn this into an event people will be interested in?‚Äù

Sure, most of us can‚Äôt just buy a concert venue or open our own comedy club, but there are plenty of local businesses out there‚Äîcoffee shops, breweries, barbershops‚Äî eager to try something if you just ask, ‚ÄúHey, do you want to do something fun to bring in customers?‚Äù

You‚Äôd be surprised how much demand there is for cool new events. People are dying for things to do.¬†

One of my friends heard his barber talk about how he wanted a unique way to bring in customers. So my friend (a comedian) asked if the barbershop would be down to do a comedy show. Since then, we‚Äôve been hosting monthly comedy shows at the shop and the last 5 shows sold out. It just goes to show there‚Äôs HUGE demand for events (as long as you put in the work for marketing and do your best to make sure people walk away happy). After all, San Jose is one of the biggest cities in the US with a significant youth population.

It‚Äôs also a cool way to help highlight and support local businesses!

On that note, we‚Äôre hosting a comedy show near downtown tonight, where comedians pitch absurd startups audience members ask questions, and vote on their favorite 'startup' to get a cash prize at the end. It‚Äôs basically a silly, comedy version of Shark Tank. If you want to check it out, head to [pitchestoriches.eventbrite.com](http://pitchestoriches.eventbrite.com) and use code **FREETIX** (good for the first 5 people). It‚Äôs happening at Narrative Fermentations, a laid-back, locally-owned brewery (I recommend visiting even if you can‚Äôt make the show. The owner Jon is a super nice guy and the drinks are great!)

But my point here is there is opportunity to spark something new in SJ. If you‚Äôre passionate about something, start checking out neighborhood businesses, and if you find one you like, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask if they‚Äôd be down to collaborate on an event. Remember, San Jose doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äòboring‚Äô.¬†",44,1741978173.0,SanJose,26,0.91,False

As a choir teacher, I often get kids from 7th grade until graduation, so it's not uncommon for me to be their ""trusted adult"" when I literally get to watch them grow up.

This girl had started abusing her medications and had developed an addiction. As she's breaking down, I finally had to use the suicide prevention training and ask the dreaded question ""are you having thoughts of suicide?"" She was. Short version, this girl basically lived in my room for the remainder of the year amd i spent many more hours talking to the counselor about her. She was in my second and fifth period classes as well as some online college classes, and got permission from another teacher to work independently on another class. When I had other lessons come in, she moved to one of my practice rooms and worked in there. We got her to graduation in a better place, and I got a heartfelt letter and my favorite coffee mug as a ""thank you"".

We kept in touch as she went off to college, and she'd stop in to say hi to me on the rare occasions she was back in town. This week she reached out again. She's been accepted into a graduate program at a good school far from our tiny town and her crappy home life, and wanted to let me and the counselor know that she was only still here because of the support she got from us her senior year.

Welcome to season 8 finale part 2.....

That is all.....

Well, we did write a full-length description for part 1 of the season 8 finale, so we don't see the point of writing a more ""descriptive description"" for part 2 of the season 8 finale. I mean we are not even sure if many of y'all even read this description part (if you read and if you are reading this one remember Jayalalithaa is a thirudi). Anyway just to explain why season 8 part 2 finale episode doesn't need a descriptive description, we ended up writing a descriptive description, even though it is not directly describing the episode, we may have explained something completely different. Sorry for consuming your time making you read this but as a consolation end message before you start listening to this episode, we have a joke; A student kept partying after reading ""part D"" in his book, why? Because after ""part D"" comes ""PartE"". (Sorry)

1jbay1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1jbay1w/progress_on_200k_loan_10_years_later/,"Progress on +200K loan, 10 years later.","This is not advice for anyone. It is just a real example of someone who graduated Pharm School in 5/2015 with a loan balance of $219,659.68. This is our in progress journey so far and I hope this serves as one example of how a couple is realistically paying this mountain of debt off. Yes, there have been things we could have differently but not falling into ‚Äúwoulda coulda shoulda‚Äù. Here are some numbers first:

From 5/1/2015 - 8/1/2019: Paid a total of $78,147.20 of which $21,421.68 was Principal and $56,725.52 was interest.  Balance remaining was $198,238.00.

From 8/1/2019 - 2/1/2021: Paid a total of
$58,554.90 of which $47,464.35 was principal and $10,636.11 was interest. Balance remaining was $150,773.65.

From 2/1/2021 - 2/1/2025: Paid a total of 
$123,917.28 of which $110,696.06 was Principal and $13,133.87 was interest. Balance is now $40,077.59.

So far in almost 10 years, we have paid a total of $260,619.38 of which $179,582.09 was principal and $80,495.50 of interest. The majority of this interest ($50k of $80k) was paid in the first 4 years. Interest is a dangerous thing. 

As you can see, we are at about $40k of remaining loans left but there is a shimmering of light for us. 

Here‚Äôs the backstory: Wife graduated Pharm school in 2015 and started paying approx $800-$1000 per month on an income based repayment plan. She had a total of 13-14 separate loans of various types (subs, unsubs, private) with varying interest rates ranging from 3 to 9%. After approximately 3 years of paying only $800-$1000 monthly, she still had not paid off $1 off of principal since there was so much accrued interest. 

Wife and I met in 2015 and got married in 2018. After we got married, we opened up our books, realized the problem we were in, and got aggressive with payments. We started paying off anywhere from $2k-$3k a month and payed off the smaller loan balances first. The interest was killing us as our daily interest was almost $30 per day.  

In 2019, once our balance was under $200k I decided to consolidate her loans to a fixed interest rate. I knew we would lose some benefits by consolidating but again, interest was killing us and rates that companies were offering us were very low. 

From 2019-2021, we continued paying anywhere from $2k to $3k a month. Covid hit the world during this time but we weren‚Äôt able to take advantage of forbearance since we consolidated in 2019. Luckily we had our jobs and just continued to pay.

In 2021, our balance was $150k and I decided to consolidate our loans again due to low interest rates and got it down to 3.6%. And from 2021 to now, we‚Äôve been paying this monster down and as of today, we‚Äôre at about 38k remaining balance.

As a pharmacist, wife makes 140k. I work in tech and make 260k. When I met my wife in 2015, I was making about $150k and have steadily increased my earnings to where I‚Äôm at now. Although we typically pay $2-3k a month, there are some months where we throw additional money to reduce the balance.

We live in a crummy neighborhood where housing is less expensive and I drive a paid off 10 year old car. We both max out our 401k and invest additional in our brokerage accounts. (We‚Äôre at over $1.1M combined in our retirement accounts but I was also contributing years before meeting my wife). Kirkland is what I wear. We do splurge on expensive vacations throughout the year and going out to eat. We don‚Äôt count pennies when we go grocery shopping. We buy overrated $7 coffee on a daily basis.

So we don‚Äôt follow Dave Ramsey‚Äôs method of living off of rice and beans and throwing everything at the loan but it did at least teach us to get serious about our student loan debt. We could be paying off the loans faster but we also need to live realistically for our sanity. I know we‚Äôre both fortunate to have high salaries. I hope this serves as an example of someone paying off these ridiculous student loans. We are on track to pay off the remaining in a little more than a year.

1jbavh2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jbavh2,Accepting AGA,"Hey, so back in late novemeber/early December 2024 I noticed I was shedding more hair. However, I only noticed I started thinning at the sides of my head December 10th. I got some blood work done, and my primary care physician said everything looked alright and should have caused hair loss. (However, my ferriton levels were 12, so I know now that is not good for hair growth and I am redoing blood work and probably getting a second opinion.) She also told me if my hair loss gets worse she could refer me to a dermatologist. 

Of course, my hair loss continued. I was/am shedding much more hair than I used to. Since it happened suddenly and I have been dealing with a lot of stress from work and other things (I have anxiety so I can really get worked up), I really thought that this was TE. My hair loss is over all diffuse, but I notice it the most at the sides and the top of my head. My part line is mostly the same, but my bathroom lighting makes it look quite bad lol. It really thinned out quickly (it makes me so so sad). Anyways, in February I decided since it hasnt gotten any better and I would like a second opinion, I asked for a referral to a dermatologist. 

I saw the dermatologist a little over two weeks ago now. My shedding has improved since janurary but there is still a lot. However, I failed the pull test. I think that this is because he was testing the top and lately I noticed my shedding is happening mostly around the back, but I could be wrong on that end. I still see shedding everywhere. Also, since I dont have a definite cause, like a traumatic event, surgery, illness, that happened a few months prior to shedding, he thinks it's androgenic alopecia. He told me it could still be from chronic stress but it is most likely aga. This really through me off guard, as I didn't consider this to be the case since it happened so fast. He prescribed me oral minoxidil since I do not plan to have kids for a few years (I am 28 and engaged, it would be nice to have hair at my wedding a bit over a year from now) and he said I could also do topical with it. I am not going to do topical as I have a dog. 

It has been hard for me to accept this diagnosis, but I am slowly coming around. Those with AGA, did your hair loss happen suddenly? What has your experience been? My hair loss doesn't look as bad as it is as first day hair after a wash it always looks fuller for me. I just started OM two days ago, as I was still contemplating it. But I figured it won't hurt to try and if it doesn't work I can always stop. The side effects make me nervous and I am not one to take medication often. I am currently also taking a multi vitamin with iron and an omega 3. I am vegan and am scared that that is also contributing to the hair loss (I have been for 8 years now). I am considering changing my diet. I am also actively working to reduce stress in my daily life. I stopped drinking coffee to decrease anxiety and noticed that helped a ton!

Sorry for the long post, I just am at a loss. I don't have many people who understand in my life and feel alone in this. I feel like all was good with my hair and now all the sudden I have this condition that will continue to progress and I have no idea how and why this occurred.

So I went out for 1 year with a woman we'll call Emma (20 years old), everything always went very well. We were really good together, really nothing to worry about during the first months. But one day after 3 months of relationship I received a message. It‚Äôs her best friend who informs me that she cheated on me with her former sex date (let‚Äôs call her Carole). Not being on good terms with her friend I decided not to believe her and then at the time my girlfriend swore to me that it was false. So I decide that this incident is unimportant so we continue our lives without worries. The whole relationship is going well but I still have more and more doubts, I come across messages with her flirting ex, containing ""baby, my heart, my life,..."", each time she reassures me, so I believe her. 
After 10 months we decided to move together (I know it's quick but I have to leave for my studies). We look for apartments in June and we find one, we sign the lease, and departure is planned for the beginning of September. 
In July, I discovered through a friend that Carole was going to move in with her girlfriend, I said to myself okay cool. Then she shows me a photo of the famous friend and it wasn't my surprise to discover that it was Emma. I realize that MY girlfriend is going to move in with her old flirt even though ok she has to move in together in 2 months. 
I don't really understand what's going on but I'm starting to understand that she's always lied to me, I'm shocked a little bit then I decide that no, it's not going to happen like that. She doesn‚Äôt know that I know so that‚Äôs a big advantage. 
I go to spend the weekend at her place as if nothing had happened and I decide that it will be the weekend from hell! Let me explain: I replace sugar with salt in her coffee, I serve her piping hot coffee and say it's cold, I sew the pockets of her pants and unstitch the back of her pants, I slashed her car tires, siphoned her tank, she arrived so late for work that her boss almost fired her. The end of the weekend is approaching, she is mentally exhausted, on Sunday evening I sit in the living room and I tell her that I know... And there I see the connections in her eyes, she understands that everything that happens to her is me, she understands that I know. Before she even has time to justify herself, I tell her it‚Äôs over and I leave. 
After this weekend I had a lot of trouble getting over it, I had to find new accommodation and above all regain confidence. After that Carole and Emma we moved in together and stayed together for 2 years! 
I'm telling you all this because a few days ago I received a message from the famous Carole (the ex flirt) because we realized that she lied to us about a lot of things, even though this story goes back 3 years!!! I can't wait to find out what else she lied about, looking back I'm very, very happy to no longer be around her. ",3,1741977203.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.8,False

The manufacturers of Wellbutrin are not the same! No one can convince me otherwise because I have been on this med for almost four years now and I have tried several different ones and for some reason they all gave me different side effects and felt different to me. Even though it's the same drug the manufacturers vary a lot in its effects. This seems to be a huge problem for Wellbutrin for some reason.

I was recently switched to another manufacturer called Bluefish and I noticed immediately when I took it that it was not working at all. They literally felt like sugar pills all the time when I was taking them and didn't do anything whatsoever. It felt almost like I was not taking anything at all. I almost thought that the med stopped working completely. Bluefish made me extremley tired, drowsy, gave me brain fog and I had no energy or motivation to do anything while I was taking it. My executive dysfunction was getting worse to the point of not being able to go to work while I was on it. Felt so emotionally numb on it too. Yesterday I went back to my old manufacturer called Accord and It started working again. I can say now that there is a huge difference between them too. Accord is just working a lot better for me and I have finally some energy and motivation to do things again. My executive dysfunction is slowly getting better too.

It's just unbeliveable that this is even allowed to be honest! The manufacturers shouldn't be that different from each other. But once again just by getting switched to another one made it all worse for me. I have also tried several different others and they either didn't work at all or gave me terrible side effects. By the way I just have to say that Teva has to be the number one worst manufacturer of this med after Bluefish. Teva was not a great experience for me at all while I was on it. It seems like it released too much of it into my system in the morning when I took it and it felt like I had ten cups of coffee all at once. But that was not the worst of it. It seems like there was nothing left over for later in the day and that made me have a huge crash midday from it. It also caused extreme anger and irritability that got almost out of control and made me almost have outbursts from it. I also got huge dysphoria from it that made me cry uncontrollably for no reason which almost caused a mental breakdown for me. I promised myself afterwards that I was never going to take Teva ever again. I don't even want to touch that stuff again even though I still have half the bottle left in my pantry. That's how horrible it was.

Just by these experiences I have had with some of the different manufacturers of Wellbutrin I just want to warn you that If you don't feel good recently on it or it stopped working check your manufacturer.

Imagine having a personal assistant who never sleeps, doesn‚Äôt take coffee breaks, and can juggle a hundred tasks at once. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, welcome to the world of AI agents! These digital helpers are revolutionizing the way we work, play, and interact with technology. But what exactly are they, and how do they work? Let‚Äôs break it down in a fun, simple way!

**What Are AI Agents?**

An AI agent is basically a software program that can make decisions, solve problems, and even learn from experience‚Äîall without needing constant human input. Think of it as a super-smart robot brain, but without the metal body (unless you count robots like Sophia). AI agents can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering customer service questions to beating humans at chess or even driving cars!

**How Do They Work?**

AI agents operate by gathering information, processing it, and then making decisions based on that data. They usually follow this process:

1. **Perception:**¬†The AI agent gathers data from its environment. This could be through sensors, cameras, microphones, or even text inputs.
2. **Processing:**¬†It analyzes the data using advanced algorithms and machine learning models.
3. **Decision-Making:**¬†Based on what it has learned, the agent takes action, whether that‚Äôs answering a question, moving a robot arm, or recommending your next Netflix binge.
4. **Learning & Adapting:**¬†Many AI agents can improve over time, meaning they get smarter the more they interact with people and situations.

**Types of AI Agents**

AI agents come in all shapes and sizes, and they can be categorized based on how smart they are:

* **Simple Reflex Agents:**¬†These are basic, rule-following bots that react to specific inputs. Think of a thermostat that adjusts the temperature when it gets too hot.
* **Model-Based Agents:**¬†These have a memory and can make decisions based on past experiences. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa fit into this category.
* **Goal-Based Agents:**¬†These AI agents work toward a specific goal and make decisions based on achieving that goal. Self-driving cars are a great example.
* **Learning Agents:**¬†These are the brainiacs of the AI world. They learn and improve over time, getting smarter with each interaction. Think of AI systems like ChatGPT or advanced recommendation engines like those used by Amazon and Netflix.

**Why Should You Care?**

AI agents are already part of our daily lives, whether we realize it or not. Here‚Äôs how they‚Äôre making things easier:

* **Smart Assistants:**¬†Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant help you with everything from setting reminders to playing your favorite songs.
* **Chatbots:**¬†Many websites use AI-powered chatbots to assist customers 24/7.
* **Personalized Recommendations:**¬†Ever wonder how Netflix knows exactly what you want to watch? That‚Äôs AI at work!
* **Self-Driving Technology:**¬†AI agents are driving innovation in autonomous vehicles, reducing accidents and making transportation smarter.
* **Healthcare & Finance:**¬†AI agents are analyzing medical data, detecting fraud, and even helping doctors diagnose diseases more accurately.

**The Future of AI Agents**

The possibilities for AI agents are endless. We‚Äôre looking at a future where AI-powered digital assistants could run entire businesses, handle complex research, and even assist in space exploration. The real question is: How will you use AI agents to make your life easier?

One thing‚Äôs for sure‚ÄîAI agents aren‚Äôt just coming; they‚Äôre already here. So, whether you embrace them as your new best friend or just a useful tool, one thing is certain: they‚Äôre changing the game.

So, what do you think? Are AI agents awesome or a little too futuristic for your taste? Either way, they‚Äôre here to stay, and the future is looking pretty smart!

I got a Sage/Breville Barista Express last year. A few months ago, I got a MiiCoffee DF54 grinder, since I was not happy with the built-in one.  
I use WDT for distribution, a normcore puck screen as well as a self leveling normcore temper. I also tried around with a different amount of water sprays on the beans, somewhere between 1 to 3. 
I regularly clean the machine with cafiza and our water here is relatively soft.  
I usually use medium or light roasts.  

Also, immediately before I pull a shot, I will let it run until the flow of water from the machine is steady, since, otherwise, it will take a few seconds before the first drop even comes out. I'm also always using it in manual mode so I can control the pre-infusion time and shot length.
  
  
**Now to my problem:**  
  
I am trying to dial in my beans. My goal is 2:1 in 27 seconds. I use 16.5g beans, give them two sprays of water, and guess a grind setting of 10. I might get 25 seconds, 38g out. A bit too fast for my liking, but still decent. And when I don't have a lot of time in the morning I will just leave it at that, writing down all the variables so I can adjust the next time I make a coffee.  
So the next day I adjust the grind setting to 9.7 (roughly, I just eyeball it since it's hard to read exactly). Now the shot will be completely choked and nothing or barley anything even comes out.  
Since it's morning and I want my coffee, I'll compensate immediately, going back to 10 where I started. But now the shot is way too fast, giving me 50g in 27 seconds.  
  
Now this is just an example, and the exact numbers vary a lot. But it is very common for me to get extreme variations in shot length when I only adjusted the grind setting a tiny amount, and sometimes I can do everything exactly the same but still get a huge variation.  
I am using a bottomless portafilter, and it doesn't seem like I get channeling, the shot is almost always coming out evenly.
I am using the (non-pressurized) stock basket that was included with the BBE.  
  
I am pretty much out of ideas what could be the problem, I have tried around with all these variables and try to controll for all of them.

As Lance describes in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVF7DOxOUFA), the main purpose of a colder bloom is to retain VOCs that would otherwise leave at hot temperatures. Of course the other effect here is to lower extraction by a bit.

For all my coffees lately, I've been doing 60C, 70C, 80C, and full temp blooms while keeping everything else the same, and I find that I prefer different temps for each coffee. For example, brewing a washed Abel Salinas Mejorado from Subtext, the full temp bloom produces a very brown sugar forward cup; absurdly sweet. The 60C bloom on the other hand made the cup almost perfumey with florals which were mostly absent in the full bloom brew. I find that I like somewhere in between, like 75C. 

Curious what other people's experiences are with varying bloom temps. I think moving forward it will be a game-changer for me, in particular for more delicate floral or heavily processed coffees.",10,1741976578.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

Fast forward to today‚Äîwe have lightning-fast 5G, and the only thing we wait for is our coffee to brew. ‚òï

Technology has reshaped our everyday routines in ways we barely notice. Let‚Äôs take a quick trip down memory lane and see how far we‚Äôve come:

# 1. üìû Communication: From Letters to Instant DMs

**Then:** You‚Äôd wait days (or weeks) for a handwritten letter.  
**Now:** You can message someone on the other side of the world instantly‚Äîand if they don‚Äôt reply in 5 minutes, we assume something‚Äôs wrong!

Fun fact: The first text message was sent in 1992, and it simply said **‚ÄúMerry Christmas.‚Äù** üéÑ Imagine if they knew what memes were coming!

# 2. üì∫ Entertainment: From VHS to Streaming Binge-Fests

**Then:** Friday night meant a trip to the video store and hoping your favorite movie wasn‚Äôt already rented.  
**Now:** You can stream an entire TV series in one weekend‚Äîbecause *who needs sleep anyway?*

Crazy thought: **Netflix** started by mailing DVDs. Now, they deliver binge-worthy shows on-demand worldwide.

# 3. üõí Shopping: From Malls to Click-and-Deliver

**Then:** Shopping meant battling crowds, long lines, and hoping your favorite store had your size.  
**Now:** A few clicks and your package arrives in hours‚Äîsometimes before you‚Äôve even changed out of your pajamas.

By the way, the **first online purchase**? A **Sting CD** in 1994. We‚Äôve come a long way from that to buying groceries and gadgets online.

# 4. üöó Navigation: From Paper Maps to GPS Perfection (Mostly)

**Then:** Road trips required folding (and refolding) massive paper maps‚Äîand lots of arguments.  
**Now:** GPS not only tells you where to go but even warns you about traffic jams and speed traps.

Of course, there‚Äôs always that one moment when GPS says ‚ÄúRecalculating‚Ä¶‚Äù right when you need it most.

# 5. ü§ñ Smart Homes: From Light Switches to Voice Commands

**Then:** Want the lights off? Better get up.  
**Now:** Just tell Alexa, Siri, or Google to do it for you. (But beware‚Äîthey‚Äôre always listening üëÄ).

Fun stat: By 2025, over **75 billion** smart devices will be connected worldwide. Our homes are becoming smarter than we ever imagined.

**The Big Picture?**  
Technology isn‚Äôt just changing how we live‚Äîit‚Äôs rewriting how we interact with the world. And while we sometimes grumble about screen time or Wi-Fi issues, it‚Äôs hard to deny how much easier (and fun) life has become.

1jbafjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingDietNews/comments/1jbafjz/dr_ozs_shocking_claims_debunked_the_truth_will/,Dr. Oz's SHOCKING Claims Debunked: [The TRUTH Will Make You Furious!],"Introduction: Understanding Dr. Oz's Influence on Health Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know many people trust celebrity doctors, even if scientists disagree? Dr. Oz is very famous. His TV show reached lots of people. This made him important in health talks. This article looks at Dr. Oz's health advice. It is important to think about health claims carefully. We want you to understand if his advice is good. You will learn how to decide if health advice is correct. It is needed to use real facts for health choices. Learn why evidence-based medicine matters.

The Scope of Dr. Oz's Health Claims: From Weight Loss to Wellness
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Dr. Oz talks about many things. He talks about losing weight. He suggests supplements. He gives wellness tips. He talks about alternative medicine. Alternative medicine means using things like herbs instead of regular medicine. These ideas are on his TV show. He writes about them too. His ideas are popular. But, we must ask: Are they correct? Does science agree? Understanding his topics helps us think. We can then decide what to believe. It is important to stay skeptical.

Controversies Surrounding Dr. Oz's Medical Advice: Examining the Critiques
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some doctors do not agree with Dr. Oz. They say some advice is bad. For example, he talked about green coffee beans for losing weight. Some scientists said this did not work. They said there was no proof. He also talked about detox diets. Some doctors say detox diets are not good. They can even be bad for you. It is important to know these debates. Then you can decide if Dr. Oz's advice is right for you.

Fact-Checking Dr. Oz: Examining the Evidence Behind the Claims
--------------------------------------------------------------

Good scientists check health claims carefully. They do clinical trials. These trials test if something works. They use peer-reviewed research. This means other scientists check the work. They also use meta-analyses. This combines many studies. This helps them see if something is really true. If Dr. Oz makes a claim, look for this proof. Does science back him up? This helps you know if his advice is good. Science must agree with Dr. Oz.

The Impact of Dr. Oz's Platform: Influence on Public Health and Consumer Behavior
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do people listen to Dr. Oz? He is famous. This fame makes people trust him. This is like a halo effect. People think if someone is famous, they must be right. This can make people buy things he suggests. Even if these things do not work. It is important to know this. Do not just trust someone because they are famous. Check the facts first. Fame does not mean truth.

Differentiating Evidence-Based Medicine from Pseudoscience: A Guide for Consumers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spotting bad health advice can be easy. Look for big promises. Be careful if someone says something is a ""miracle cure"". Watch out for stories that sound too good to be true. Make sure there is real research. Peer-reviewed research is important. If someone just has stories, that is not enough. Ask your doctor too. They can help you decide if something is safe and will work.

Finding Reliable Health Information: Resources and Strategies for Informed Decision-Making
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where can you find good health advice? The NIH is good. The CDC also has correct information. Big hospitals like Mayo Clinic are good too. These places use science. They do not just guess. They have doctors and scientists. They check their information. Look for websites that end in .gov or .edu. These are usually more trustworthy. Do not trust everything you see on the internet.

Conclusion
----------

Dr. Oz is famous. But not all his advice is good. Check the facts. Use science to decide. Talk to your doctor. Do not just listen to famous people. Science is important for your health. Check with a doctor to be safe. Share this with your friends. Help them stay healthy too. Talk about good health.

1jbaf59,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1jbaf59/diamond_lounge_experience_at_nmacc/,Diamond Lounge experience at NMACC,"Had such a lovely experience at my first viewing of a musical NMACC. Booked 2 tickets for Phantom of the Opera. Since it was my first time I wasn't sure what the best seat/stand was so decided on Lower Balcony which was 2500/person. 

The icing on the cake though was the Diamond Lounge for which I paid Rs3700. The Diamond Lounge rooms cost 3700/room for a max of 5 people. So even if it's just you alone, or you with 4 others, you pay 3700 for the Lounge. It's a private room which comes with an assortment of complementary small bites. We went for the Non Veg menu so it was salmon and cream cheese bagels, chicken quiches, deconstructed vada Pav, cheese and cracker platter, falafel and hummus, corn and cheese tarts, and a another tray of desserts. In all it was like 3 pieces of some 15 items for the room. So again, if it's 5 people, 3pieces per item may be less to share, but for 3 ppl and below its perfect. It also has 5 cups of coffee or tea and bottles of water. By far the best part is the private powder room, which is essentially your private washroom. 

You can use the diamond lounge before the show and also during the 20 minute interval. We entered about 40 minutes before the show and had a great time in the room which has 2 comfy couches and some elegant decor in true Ambani-esque opulence. Oh, and we also have a dedicated host all through the end of the show to get take item orders, get us refreshments, remind us 5 minutes before the show starts etc.

The room also has a TV which live streams the show in the Grand Theatre so if you wish to watch the show in the comfort of the room while sipping on cocktails and chicken quiches, you have that option too!

For 3700, i felt it was a superb experience considering the variety of food on offer, as well as the comfort of your own washroom for the interval. ",2,1741976286.0,mumbai,0,1.0,False

1jbadz0,https://i.redd.it/yafd1jmg5poe1.jpeg,NEST Santa Barbara Strawberry Body Mist - A Review,"I've been on the hunt for a Strawberry scent. Nothing too sweet, cloying, synthetic or plasticky. I did not want to smell like cake, ice cream or whipped cream combo. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, I just wanted to smell like a basket of strawberries. These are the ones I've tried:

The Body Shop Strawberry - I have not technically tried this recently but I remember this from 20+ years ago. I remember thinking that I liked it back then. But TBS closed and I can't even order online anymore.

Phlur Strawberry Letter - I went to Sephora and sampled this on me. I liked it at first, like a light floral with a strawberry note. But the strawberry scent disappeared after half an hour so that was disappointing. 

Bath and Body Works Strawberry Pound Cake - Way too sweet. I felt like I was going to have a toothache. But at least it did smell exactly like what it said it would. 

Victoria's Secret Strawberry and Champagne - Definitely more champagne than strawberry. It smelled like a glass of bubbly with a slight hint of berry.

Forever 21 Berries and Cream - I had such high hopes because the top note was supposed to be strawberry followed by honeysuckle. It was terribly synthetic. Like strawberry was somehow infused into plastic that was boiled into a liquid. Oh well. 

I meant to try Malin+Goetz Strawberry but never got the chance. 

My only experience with NEST was having the Madagascar vanilla oil sample from Sephora and I hated it. It was like someone tried to shove an entire jar of Yankee Candle down my throat. I usually love vanilla scents so I had no idea what happened. But I decided to try their Santa Barbara Strawberry Mist anyway just in case it was better. 

At first spray, I didn't know what to think. It smelled like strawberry candy and I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I sprayed it on my neck and on the insides of my elbows and went to bed. I didn't expect much since body mists don't really have a lot of staying power. 

Seven hours later, I woke up smelling and feeling delicious. The dry down was AMAZING and the scent was still very much present. It was like a combination of fruity and green scents, like I went to a juice bar and ordered a strawberry smoothie or ate a cup of strawberry jelly. It had an underlying gentle floral scent beneath the stronger strawberry note. It wasn't cloying or plasticky at all. 

I worked for a few hours at home in my pajamas and the scent did not disappear. It was weaker but it was still there. I smelled so yummy that I skipped my morning coffee because I didn't want to mess things up. Just before lunch, I sprayed it on my wrist once. It took approximately an hour for it to dry down and settle into that fresh strawberry floral scent. 

In short, the hunt was a success. It's a perfect pick me up for when I need positive vibes or just want to smell like fruit for the day. ",5,1741976158.0,Perfumes,1,0.78,False

Wanted to share my experience with the¬†**Waterdrop X12**¬†after seeing it on BOS‚Äôs YouTube channel (solid review, BTW). Here‚Äôs the real talk:

**Why I Bought It:**

* Our tap water smells like chlorine (thanks, city supply).
* BOS‚Äôs video convinced me it‚Äôs legit for heavy metals.

**What I Love:**  
‚úÖ¬†**Speed**: Fills a glass in seconds ‚Äì no more awkwardly staring at the sink.  
‚úÖ¬†**Design**: Sleek stainless steel ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt look like a spaceship under the sink.  
‚úÖ¬†**Taste**: Coffee tastes less bitter (finally!).

**What‚Äôs Meh:**  
‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**Pricey Filters**: Replacement costs made me wince, but hoping they last.  
‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**Installation**: Took me 30 mins (IKEA-level patience required).

**Question for You All:**¬†Anyone else using¬†[Waterdrop](https://www.waterdropfilter.com/?ref=7tpv4skadhat&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=goaffpro)¬†stuff? How‚Äôs your long-term experience? Did your pets notice the water change? (My cat‚Äôs obsessed now.)
