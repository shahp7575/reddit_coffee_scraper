Birdie's content bombed (images 6-8) but she got to touch grass for the 2nd time in her life!  Kylea's paternal grandma is allegedly assembling a table (farmhouse legs ordered from Amazon).

Kylea baited her followers with the portion size in image 10 and that juicy comment thread has been deleted. She did a ""someone said"" post about carbs in image 13 as rage bait.  It didn't work. 

Since her numbers were sh!t, she made a beeline to Target (without her emotional support animal that goes EvErYWhErE with her üòâ) to try on more outfits (images 11-12 & 15) she didn't purchase. She activated her photo modification skills and waited for all that praise and validation to be told to buy them all, she's looks great in all styles and colors, and deserves the clothes. ü´¢  This frugal minimalist, who only buys loves not likes, is so conflicted about her new wardrobe.

1jvucg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jvucg8/i_28m_shared_my_darkest_secret_with_my_boyfriend/,I (28M) shared my darkest secret with my boyfriend (29M) and now he wont even look at me.,"For context, we‚Äôve been together for four years this year. We have an incredible relationship, and I consider him my soulmate and life partner.

A few weeks ago, I ran into an old acquaintance from my past. We hadn‚Äôt spoken in a while, but we had briefly connected just after lockdown. This had led to us hooking up, however that was only once, and we hadn‚Äôt spoken since. I met my current boyfriend a few weeks later and have since been in a happy relationship with him. 

This acquaintance, lets call him Simon, invited me to grab coffee, and since I had some free time, I agreed. After coffee, we went for a walk and ended up sitting in a park on the sunniest day of the year.

The conversation quickly took a sexual turn. He kept mentioning the fun we had had together, even though I had said to him that I now have a boyfriend. The conversation then took a darker turn. He asked me about the time I lost my virginity in boarding school, a story I had completely forgotten I had told him and one that I now regret sharing.

Despite my growing unease and the inappropriate nature of the conversation, I found myself unable to resist sharing it with him. He seemed excited about this revelation, and to my surprise, he confessed that he had had a similar experience. In my foolishness, I even confessed to him some of the darker thoughts that sometimes cross my mind. I wouldn‚Äôt call them voices, but I often have thoughts of hurting people, but these thoughts are more aimed at hurting myself. Occasionally, I even have inappropriate thoughts about touching people, but I‚Äôve always managed to keep them to myself and have never hurt or touched anyone without their consent in my life. When I saw him become even more excited about me sharing these thoughts it was then I realised what I had done and became increasingly more uncomfortable with the situation and the topic of conversation, saying I had to hurry to leave for work.

The idea that I just shared my deepest, most intrusive thoughts, especially with this person I barely know, has completely thrown me off balance. Since meeting them, I‚Äôve been plagued with worry and anxiety, fearing that these secrets I‚Äôve kept so close for so long are now out in the open. I ended up texting this acquaintance, the day after we met, expressing my discomfort with the nature of our conversation and my desire to never discuss them again. He seemed to be very understanding and apologised for making me feel uneasy, assuring me that we never had to talk about it again. However, this hasn‚Äôt quelled my anxieties, and for the past week, they‚Äôve only intensified. I‚Äôve stopped eating properly, and as soon as I wake up, I‚Äôm instantly hit with a wave of nauseous anxiety. My vision has narrowed, and it feels like the world is crushing me. This is the most anxious I‚Äôve ever been in my life.

It was all becoming too much and I was slowly becoming a shell of myself. I‚Äôm a shy and private person but I am generally a happy guy with a good social life. But ever since meeting this old acquaintance I have been terrified that somehow this conversation would get back to my friends and even my boyfriend. So a few days ago I confessed to him that I had been experiencing these thoughts and that I had shared them with this person. 

At first he was very understanding and comforting, telling me he still loved me and that nothing had changed. However, yesterday was a really bad day. I was crying constantly with the heavy panging feeling of anxiety gripping my whole body. So with the help of my boyfriend I met with my best friend and also shared with her how sad and anxious I was feeling about sharing these dark thoughts with this acquaintance. I was in floods of tears, I was shaking with worry and anxiety but my best friend and bf sat with me and held my hand as I confessed all my inner torments.

My best friend and I went for a walk. She tried to calm me down and reassure me that everything was okay. She‚Äôs incredibly understanding and has been texting me every hour since to check in. However, when I got home, I realised that my boyfriend‚Äôs behaviour had completely changed. He was very distant all night and wouldn‚Äôt even look at me while we watched a movie. When I asked if he was okay, he said after some reflection that what I had shared deeply troubled him and that he even considered leaving me. He also admitted that he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle this situation properly. This morning he left for work without even saying goodbye or a kiss on the forehead, something he‚Äôs always done since we‚Äôve been together. I woke up this morning feeling lost and completely enveloped in anxiety.

This is the last thing I wanted to happen, and now I wish I had never told him. To be honest, I wish I had never agreed to go with that acquaintance in the first place. I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do or how to fix this. I‚Äôve booked a therapy appointment for next week to try and sort out my thoughts, but I‚Äôm struggling immensely. Now, with the added anxiety of the possibility of my boyfriend breaking up with me over this, I‚Äôm not sure if I have the strength to continue and unsure what to do?

1jvubd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrdev/comments/1jvubd0/i_have_an_idea_for_a_virtual_school_in_vr/,I have an idea for a virtual school in VR,"As a teacher, I‚Äôve been thinking about an idea for a while, and I wanted to share it here to see what others think.

What if we created a full school experience in virtual reality? Students would wear VR headsets and join a classroom where they sit at desks as avatars. They could look around, see each other, talk, and learn just like in a real classroom. The teacher would also be there in VR, standing, using a virtual whiteboard, a presentation and explaining lessons in real time.

One of the key parts of the idea is to use passthrough, so each student can still see their real desk, notebook, tools, or even coffee while staying inside the virtual space (EXACTLY LIKE META HORIZON WORKROOMS).

The classroom with be totally controlled by the teachers where they can mute/unmute students, lock/unlock their movements

The most exciting part is how we could use the features of VR to make learning better. In math, for example students could explore 3D graphs or geometric shapes in front of them. In science, they could walk through the solar system, explore cells, or run virtual experiments. In history, they could visit ancient places or reenact events.. Learning could be visual, interactive, and way more engaging.

This is just an idea for now, I haven‚Äôt started building anything. But I believe as a teacher something like this could really improve education and make it more accessible for students around the world.

And honestly, there‚Äôs so much more I have in mind, from virtual study rooms, to exam systems, to hybrid features that bring VR and real life even closer together. This is just the beginning.

If anyone‚Äôs interested in this idea, has feedback, or would want to help bring it to life, I‚Äôd really love to connect.

1jvu6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jvu6yx/drip_coffee_options_for_starter_coffee_cart/,Drip Coffee Options for Starter Coffee Cart,"Drip Coffee Maker for Cart

Hi everyone, 

I‚Äôve been researching ideas and equipment for a modest coffee cart setup to launch in the small town in the US I‚Äôm moving to this summer. 

My idea is that I could start with three drip coffee flavors with a pastry selection. I‚Äôd have an option to do a pour over for some special high end coffee for folks who are more interested in fancy stuff. But I think going too fancy might alienate some customers because this is a really small town. Good coffee and pastries feels approachable. I figure if it looks like the business is growing, I‚Äôll add an espresso machine as a next step. This way I‚Äôll have time to train as well. 

I‚Äôm open to opinions on this strategy. 

I‚Äôd want the freedom to be a free standing setup with my own power and water. 

Can I ask, what drip coffee machines or drip coffee setups for carts have worked for people? Can I ask for equipment names, descriptions and how you powered them and what water supply ideas worked? Sorry to ask for so much detail. I‚Äôm trying to figure this out as I complete a degree here in Europe, search for a second job in the US from afar and pack for this massive move.

I need advice as I am at my wits end with my new laptop. It is an HP that I got recently for work.

It DOES NOT stay connected to WiFi and literally drops connection every few seconds. It is making my work days slow, inefficient and beyond frustrating.

My line of work requires me to travel around a lot and meet with clients at various places including coffee shops, offices etc. Regardless of where I am and what WiFi network I am using, it consistently drops connection and reverts to the ‚ÄúNo Internet‚Äù error message.

I then have to disconnect from the WiFi network manually and re-connect. Sometimes multiple times before the internet connection will actually restore.

This isn‚Äôt only frustrating for me, but for clients as well. Especially when they have limited time to see me and everything is on a go slow because the systems keep dropping. It‚Äôs downright embarrassing, actually.

Some of the systems we use bomb you out when you lose internet connection, so I have to restart the whole process from the beginning. I was at a meeting the other day and the client said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we just use my laptop instead‚Äù. I was mortified.

At times, the WiFi disappears entirely from the laptop, and only Bluetooth is available. I generally then have to shut down and re-start altogether.

I took the laptop back to where I purchased it, and all they did was run a basic diagnostic test. Following which they told me they were unable to pick up any issues, so there is nothing they can do. They refused to let me return it or send it away to be repaired.

Obviously because the basic diagnostic only tests for software issues, not hardware issues.

I really am at my wits end. It‚Äôs damaging my business and I cannot afford to simply discard this laptop and buy a whole new one. It wasn't cheap. 

Can anyone offer any advice on what may be wrong?",1,1744279026.0,Laptop,0,1.0,False
1jvu5lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1jvu5lo/venting_loong/,Venting (loong),"We met over ten years ago and fell in love. I always noticed he was a bit ""weird"". I couldn't put my finger on it, but for example his coffee cup had to be in the same place, he would get angry if I moved it or used it. He had specific ways of doing things and always managed to make me feel like a slob and a child when I was just trying to live and do my best. And he has always been so weird about money. Like he made a point not to buy anything for me so I wouldn't get used to it or use his money (he wasn't rich btw and I was getting my degree AND working). But I felt that I couldn't break up for such a ""small"" reason. Most of the time he was loving, kind, funny and never ever violent in any way. We really had fun and I was happy with him.¬†

When we had a child I feel like he either changed or revealed who he really was. He couldn't stand the baby crying and would have meltdowns over it. He put the baby down and went away crying and screaming and slamming doors. This of course made me feel like I can't trust him with our child and it broke my heart. I feel like he wanted to be a loving father and tried, but it was just too hard for him. He would come and go and make me feel guilty for asking him to stay with us so that I could take a moment alone. I feel I was and maybe still am depressed.

One time I was showering and he put the baby to bed. The baby cried and he was anxious again. When I got out, he asked me angrily why I couldn't shower during the day (when I was at home with the baby), why did I have to shower alone. Which kind of broke my heart a bit, because I feel it revealed again his true colors about responsibility and respect.¬†

The baby grew and things got better, they have a beautiful relationship now. But he is still too strict for my taste. Things have to be done his way and he gets angry or frustrated if something goes wrong. Like this morning: he was getting our daughter dressed. They have a system, because she is easily distracted and the system is fine. Usually I still sleep when they are getting dressed, but today I had to go to the office, so I got up earlier. He had made our daughter cry (she didn't get undressed and dressed fast enough, sometimes you just have to do it yourself and she doesn't like it). When I got to the kitchen, she ran to me crying and I hugged her and kissed her and told it's okay, now go get dressed. My husband was SO angry. He forcefully dressed our daughter, I told him to calm down and that what he was doing was wrong. He started yelling at me that I always criticize him (wft, projection much??), he's not going to do anything anymore, I should take her to daycare if I was so much better at this (wtf wtf, just came out of nowhere).

I kept calm because I don't want to yell in front of our daughter. I told him, that his system is ok but it doesn't mean he can manhandle our daughter like that. He left the room, slammed the door and came back. Our daughter asked where he went, so he said ""daddy had to go calm down because mommy was being mean"". What a spiteful bitch he is but the worst part is that I WASN'T BEING MEAN. I could understand his reaction if I had been mean but I wasn't, I was just telling him he's wrong!!! And it literally came out of nowhere. We had been up for 10 minutes and he acted like I had just ruined his day just by existing, just by stepping in to the room.

So he took her to daycare and has been giving me the silent treatment (over messages) since.

This incident made me think for the 500th time that maybe it is time to get a divorce. I can't live like this. I can't let myself be treated like this. I don't want my child to see this and model her future based on this. But something was different this time. This time I actually meant it AND I didn't feel anything. Before I always ended up crying or scared or sad when thinking about divorce, but now I just feel numb. I've had enough.

I feel like I have been walking on eggshells for years. I always have to read his mood. Often when he comes home I panic clean a bit because I don't want him to huff and puff and start cleaning with excessive noise. I don't feel any sexual connection to him, haven't in years. I don't want to kiss him and I don't want to even touch him. I feel like he is just a burden in my home and everything would be so much easier without him.

But of course my heart breaks for our kid and I can't stand the thought of not seeing her every day. Of course she is still so little that I would get to keep her for the majority of the time. And I think it would be better for his mental state if he had her for maybe one night + Saturday/Sunday per week.

Just venting. How did my life go to this. Why did I choose the wrong man just like my mom and my sister and all of my aunts. Is my child ever going to forgive me if I break up the family? 

When we come home today he is either mad at ME and being mean or he comes home with flowers and apologizes. I feel like it doesn't matter anymore and he is just ""buying"" the right to be an absolute dick with giving me flowers.",1,1744278995.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

I started my large composting bay with a load of grass clippings mixed with dead grass and weeds, cardboard, wood ash and some kitchen scraps last week and it's heating up a treat! 

I would love some compost to put around my veg garden basically ASAP. What would you do in my situation? I don't know if I should keep them separate or just empty the cold bin into the hot bay and mix them all up. I'm going to turn them both anyway and put more shredded cardboard into the bay.

1jvu2u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1jvu2u8/hey_so_never_ever_get_admitted_or_admit_someone/,Hey so never EVER get admitted or admit someone to Centerpointe,"So I'm currently about a day out of Centerpointe, a so called rehab and psych ward. They have a few locations I think and I went to the one near St. Charels, and it was literally the worst experience of my life. I was trying to find a place for alcohol withdrawal, I went to another different rehab to get admitted, but they would not because I recently self harmed again for the first time in a year so they told me to go to Centerpointe. I only stayed for 24 hours though but I still have a lot to say.

I was already scared because the reviews were a whopping 2.2 stars out of almost 30p reviews, but my mom (who was taking me I'm only 20) told me it was probably just because most people there were involuntary so they left and put down negative reviews, which I sort of got but was still skeptical. 

Well, when we got there, there was no one in the  waiting room and it was maybe 6pm. They gave me the paperwork, I did it quickly, and gave it to the receptionist. After that no one else came in and it still took them 3 and a half house for them to take me back....only for them to sit me in another room to wait for a nurse. I was getting pretty severe symptoms by this point as well to also add. After that it took another 3ish hours for them to officially have me looked at and checked in, so then I was changed into scrubs and admitted to the actual hospital.

So, they also don't separate the people there that are either detoxing, in psychosis, or just overall very depressed. They also do not separate the girls and boys, or by age if you are over 18. I went back and it was also already light out, so they pretty much just checked my vitals, and sent me to my room that was with a roomate, a stiff mattress, and a single uncomfortable ""blanket"" and pretty much just told to sleep. 

I was still given 0 medication at this point even though I was in withdrawal and I could not sleep and became paranoid. I was awake and went out at around 2am to tell them I was not feeling good and was withdrawing from alcohol. They, again, pretty much shrugged me off to bed. I came out again an hour later and begged one of the nurses to give me something. She gave me Libruim and some sedative, which I took and then finally was able to sleep. I then woke up I think an hour later and experienced what I can only call audio and physical hallucinations from the drugs, hearing my roommate wake up when she did not, her climbing into my bed and whispering stuff to me for about 2 hours in perpetual fear until I eventually fell asleep again until the nurse knocked on our door for breakfast. 

I will say, I have gone through withdrawal at the hospital and the stuff they gave me also gave me hallucinations, but milder, so I don't know if it's just a me thing or they gave me to high a dose, but whatever.

During the mealtime we all literally lined up and were escorted single file into a cafeteria. I will say the only perks were that the food was alright, and you had unlimited coffee and got smoke breaks after meals, but that's literally all I can think of. 

The people were a mixed bag due to them not really separating us by what we needed, and being a 20 year old girl and seeing men at least 5 years older rambling to themselves while walking around and getting into sometimes physical fights with people made me feel really unsafe. I know it's not the actual people's faults and I don't blame them personally at all, I just wish the facility would acknowledge more had to be done, and they thought all that would suffice were different lounge rooms for girls and boys and a rule that either gender can't go to the hallway of the others beds. There was also still an area in front of the nurses desk were anyone could go and where most of the phone were and you took meds, so really this just seemed Luke a poor way to handle it also

Despite this too I still saw men come into the women's lounge rooms sometimes and just either hang in there until someone got them out, or just come peak in through the window and leave cause it was still in the technical area either gender could be in. Also, there was nothing to do, actually fucking nothing. The ""books"" provided were 7 very generic books that no one had ever heard of in the girls lounge, and we got coloring pages with crayons. Thankfully, there was a TV too, only one in either lounge though and it's sort of hard to put on something that everyone would like but that is more of a personal gripe. The activities we would have scheduled was just stuff like ""art time"" where it was only the girls around and instead you get felt tip markers AND crayons (oooo goody) and gym time which was a basketball hoop, a volleyball net, and some balls (which also seemed kind of dangerous and odd they would let us do that but not other things, but whatever, it was actually the only time we had any real fun lol)

These activities were also only 1 a day for an hour, and the ""group therapy"" they offered was completely optional and was shit like us doing bingo or reading off paper, which kind of defeats the whole rehabilitation purpose. During the 24 hours I was there, I never had any real personal counseling, and the only reason I was able to get out so quickly was because I was technically voluntary, was feeling alright with the withdrawal symptoms at this point, and used the phones to literally beg my mom to try and get me out. She helped me though  the steps to also beg the nurses to finally let me see the nurse who assess your mental status, which she did and saw that I was not actively super depressed and that my cutting was due to a certain event, and that because of my past with that she deemed me ok.

 They then said I can sign forms for release but I would need to wait probably still a day for the social worker to approve. Thankfully, the nurse who assessed me actually called my mom a few hours later and my mom confirmed I was ok mentally and just there for detox and that if those symptoms were fine I can be released, so they did. I truly believe I was only able to get out so early because of my specific circumstances and because I was voluntary and not there for really anything other than a detox. Any other circumstances I heard from some of the girls I talked to they won't let you out at all and make you stay for at least a mandatory week I think in those hellish conditions.

I know this is long, but it's important no one ever comes here again, period. It make my mental health worse for even the short time I stayed there, and I can only imagine what happens to the patients there who had worse mental status already when being admitted and were forced to stay for at least 7 times longer. It was genuinely awful. Oh also to quickly add, the inside was disgusting. They don't give you soap to shower with, or really any time to shower at all, as you  share with 3 other people and have barely any free time. They are always short of scrubs and towels so that also has a part to play. You can only brush your teeth with water. There are ants and stains all over the walls and floor. It was just so so bad, like horror movie that makes fun of asylums type of bad. Read the reviews they have online as well, they have literally maybe 2 ones above 3 stars.

What if we created a full school experience in virtual reality? Students would wear VR headsets and join a classroom where they sit at desks as avatars. They could look around, see each other, talk, and learn just like in a real classroom. The teacher would also be there in VR, standing, using a virtual whiteboard, a presentation and explaining lessons in real time.

One of the key parts of the idea is to use passthrough, so each student can still see their real desk, notebook, tools, or even coffee while staying inside the virtual space (EXACTLY LIKE META HORIZON WORKROOMS).

The classroom with be totally controlled by the teachers where they can mute/unmute students, lock/unlock their movements

The most exciting part is how we could use the features of VR to make learning better. In math, for example students could explore 3D graphs or geometric shapes in front of them. In science, they could walk through the solar system, explore cells, or run virtual experiments. In history, they could visit ancient places or reenact events.. Learning could be visual, interactive, and way more engaging.

This is just an idea for now, I haven‚Äôt started building anything. But I believe as a teacher something like this could really improve education and make it more accessible for students around the world.

And honestly, there‚Äôs so much more I have in mind, from virtual study rooms, to exam systems, to hybrid features that bring VR and real life even closer together. This is just the beginning.

If anyone‚Äôs interested in this idea, has feedback, or would want to help bring it to life, I‚Äôd really love to connect.

1jvtxpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jvtxpa/i_shared_my_darkest_secret_with_my_boyfriend_and/,I shared my darkest secret with my boyfriend and now he wont even look at me.,"For context, I‚Äôm a 28-year-old male, and my boyfriend is a 29-year-old male. We‚Äôve been together for four years this year. We have an incredible relationship, and I consider him my soulmate and life partner.

A few weeks ago, I ran into an old acquaintance from my past. We hadn‚Äôt spoken in a while, but we had briefly connected about four years ago. This had led to us hooking up, however that was only once, and we hadn‚Äôt spoken since. He invited me to grab coffee, and since I had some free time, I agreed. After coffee, we went for a walk and ended up sitting in a park on the sunniest day of the year.

The conversation quickly took a sexual turn. He kept mentioning the fun we had had together, even though I had said to him that I now have a boyfriend. The conversation then took a darker turn. He asked me about the time I lost my virginity in boarding school, a story I had completely forgotten I had told him and one that I now regret sharing.

Despite my growing unease and the inappropriate nature of the conversation, I found myself unable to resist sharing it with him. He seemed excited about this revelation, and to my surprise, he confessed that he had had a similar experience. In my foolishness, I even confessed to him some of the darker thoughts that sometimes cross my mind. I wouldn‚Äôt call them voices, but I often have thoughts of hurting people, but these thoughts are more aimed at hurting myself. Occasionally, I even have inappropriate thoughts about touching people, but I‚Äôve always managed to keep them to myself and have never hurt or touched anyone without their consent in my life. When I saw him become even more excited about me sharing these thoughts it was then I realised what I had done and became increasingly more uncomfortable with the situation and the topic of conversation, saying I had to hurry to leave for work.

The idea that I just shared my deepest, most intrusive thoughts, especially with this person I barely know, has completely thrown me off balance. Since meeting them, I‚Äôve been plagued with worry and anxiety, fearing that these secrets I‚Äôve kept so close for so long are now out in the open. I ended up texting this acquaintance, the day after we met, expressing my discomfort with the nature of our conversation and my desire to never discuss them again. He seemed to be very understanding and apologised for making me feel uneasy, assuring me that we never had to talk about it again. However, this hasn‚Äôt quelled my anxieties, and for the past week, they‚Äôve only intensified. I‚Äôve stopped eating properly, and as soon as I wake up, I‚Äôm instantly hit with a wave of nauseous anxiety. My vision has narrowed, and it feels like the world is crushing me. This is the most anxious I‚Äôve ever been in my life.

It was all becoming too much and I was slowly becoming a shell of myself. I‚Äôm a shy and private person but I am generally a happy guy with a good social life. But ever since meeting this old acquaintance I have been terrified that somehow this conversation would get back to my friends and even my boyfriend. So a few days ago I confessed to him that I had been experiencing these thoughts and that I had shared them with this person. 

At first he was very understanding and comforting, telling me he still loved me and that nothing had changed. However, yesterday was a really bad day. I was crying constantly with the heavy panging feeling of anxiety gripping my whole body. So with the help of my boyfriend I met with my best friend and also shared with her how sad and anxious I was feeling about sharing these dark thoughts with this acquaintance. I was in floods of tears, I was shaking with worry and anxiety but my best friend and bf sat with me and held my hand as I confessed all my inner torments.

My best friend and I went for a walk. She tried to calm me down and reassure me that everything was okay. She‚Äôs incredibly understanding and has been texting me every hour since to check in. However, when I got home, I realised that my boyfriend‚Äôs behaviour had completely changed. He was very distant all night and wouldn‚Äôt even look at me while we watched a movie. When I asked if he was okay, he said after some reflection that what I had shared deeply troubled him and that he even considered leaving me. He also admitted that he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle this situation properly. This morning he left for work without even saying goodbye or a kiss on the forehead, something he‚Äôs always done since we‚Äôve been together. I woke up this morning feeling lost and unsure of what to do.

This is the last thing I wanted to happen, and now I wish I had never told him. To be honest, I wish I had never agreed to go with that acquaintance in the first place. I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do or how to fix this. I‚Äôve booked a therapy appointment for next week to try and sort out my thoughts, but I‚Äôm struggling immensely. Now, with the added anxiety of the possibility of my boyfriend breaking up with me over this, I‚Äôm not sure if I have the strength to continue.

Are you tired of being  prescribed medications with increasing strengths that simply do not work to alleviate your symptoms or solve the route issue causing your eczema -  always flaring right back up after your course or application is finished the same as before or even worse ?
‚Ä¢Tired of specialists and dermatologists that we as patients put our money and trust in to help us heal our chronic illness doing nothing to find a permanent solution to your flare ups ?
‚Ä¢Tired of people in your life or that you don‚Äôt even know judging you based on your appearance and symptoms of your condition ?
‚Ä¢Tired of attending education or work with the constant dread that you are disfigured and that people think you‚Äôre disgusting based on the look of your skin alone ?
‚Ä¢Tired of dreading the night times where you will be lucky getting any sleep at all tossing, turning and suffering in pain scratching your skin until it peels and bleeds ?
‚Ä¢Tired of feeling so alone struggling to find a partner or family member who loves you and is able to meet your needs as a person suffering with eczema ?
‚Ä¢Tired of being stuck inside because your skin is so sensitive to weather conditions, temperature and the environment ?
‚Ä¢Tired of missing out on social occasions with friends or family because of your symptoms preventing you from travelling, drinking alcohol or eating certain trigger foods making others view you as weird or the odd one out for not participating with them ?
‚Ä¢Finally are you tired of people suggesting: Try not itching (no ones tried this one lol)
try this new magic potion they found on instagram 
Try this aloe vera mushroom CBD gel that worked for a rash they had ten years ago
Try going vegan that must help or maybe you should go vegetarian, keto, paleo, fruitarian, fruit free, dairy free or even food free for a while it could help right?..
Try out steroids or immunosuppressants, pills powders creams lotions gels ointments maybe you just didnt find the right one ?
Try out plant and animal based fats and oils  for your skin, changing the frequency you wash, the method or products you use..

THIS NEXT SECTION WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO HEAL ECZEMA:

‚ÄúTHE CURE‚Äù - HOW TO FIND YOURS
the truth is with eczema and skin diseases alike is that there truthfully is no ‚ÄúCURE‚Äù that will work for everyone the same, there is no diet that will heal all and there is no special cream that can be applied to cure anyone of us however there are many many things we can all try to improve our skin health, reverse our inflammation and be healthy and happy with this short time we have in this life.
Im going to explain all of the things you can consider as an eczema sufferer:
Its a lot of information and may be overwhelming so I‚Äôm going to break this down into different sections so feel free to read or skip the ones your interested in as you go ill also preface this with the fact that healing is not 1 dimensional and that we must heal many foundations of our life in order to heal our immune systems and reverse the inflammation in our bodies and skin.

SOCIAL / FAMILY / LOVE LIFE:
The people in your life matter, you also must matter to them, they must be willing to meet your basic need within the relationship this includes listening to your struggles and helping you in whatever ways they can within reason, same goes for you as you must contribute to the relationship by listening to their needs and hearing them out too. It must be balanced and you sometimes must make compromises however in your journey to healing its SO IMPORTANT that the people in your life understand that your condition effects your quality of life and the activities you are able and unable to do, remember that eczema is a disability and the people in your life must understand what this means for your capabilities and ability to function in everyday life. Its okay to rely on loved ones in times of desperate need and struggle but you must remember that the biggest person who can help you is.. YOU (don‚Äôt give up on helping yourself completely and rely on others solely to help as it will cause unbalance in your relationships/friendships and may not help you as much as you think it is)
in summary put effort into the relationships that are meaningful and helpful to you and your skin and don‚Äôt focus on the relationships that are toxic and bad for your mental health (sometimes our own family can be toxic in this case if your unable to get away from them you must plan out a way you can tolerate and deal with them trying your best to reason and explain things through with them - this might still not work and i can understand what its like to feel alone in this world with your condition but you must stick through the hard times and keep a strong mind as i promise this pain is not permanent and does not have to be as bad as it is now as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

LIFESTYLE CHOICES:
this is a big topic and i am not one to judge any of you as i have done many of the listed lifestyle choices in my past so ill simplify it down to the basics; the choices we make in our life can lead to stress and inflammation for our bodies to deal with, for people with eczema the more of these stressful or inflammatory choices we make in our lives the harder it is for our bodies to deal with our condition and keep our skin in good health, some of these choices i have listed may effect you differently but speaking from personal experience many of them will most likely worsen your physical or mental health which will in turn impact your eczema symptoms, ill list off as many as i can here but there is probably more I‚Äôve missed:
‚Ä¢participating in risk taking behaviours
‚Ä¢drinking alcohol / binge drinking
‚Ä¢taking recreational drugs
‚Ä¢smoking or vaping 
‚Ä¢binge eating or under eating
‚Ä¢eating processed food / sugar
‚Ä¢caffeine (high amounts causes anxiety and depression in many people it also increases stress as its a stimulant so just be careful of how much you drink and where its sourced - energy drinks are really not ideal whereas green tea or coffee is pretty okay for most people)
‚Ä¢social media - too much can cause stress and lead to more inflammation (no ones perfect and everyone is guilty of over use even me! just be aware of your use and minimise it as best you can.
‚Ä¢situations that impact your skin could include going to raves / clubbing or going to places that stress you out such as being in a really busy place can stress you out impacting your skin.

ENVIRONMENT:
factors in the environment can impact your skin and also make it easier / harder for you to heal. There are many factors when it comes to environment so ill break them down into sections explaining each separately:
‚Ä¢THE SUN - it is important to get vitamin D and sunlight daily not only for your skin health but also for your sleep, mood and energy levels as well as your digestion and appetite. Even in times where your very inflamed you should try to get in the direct sunlight as much as you can (unless your medically diagnosed as allergic to the sun which is extremely rare in which case supplement vitamin D and hope for the best)
‚Ä¢POLLEN - pollen changes from place to place and from year to year the levels of pollen are always different, some people do well with antihistamines or with a low histamine diet however for me i have recently cured my skin and allergies through an elimination diet and gradual exposure to pollen which has almost completely got rid of my life long pollen allergies, we are all different so please experiment and see what works or what doesn‚Äôt work, if you are taking meds for allergies and your allergies are still there or worse than ever then just consider a period where you don‚Äôt take them or change the type of medication (I‚Äôve tried dozens that didn‚Äôt work so for me using no meds works the best) the body is a highly complicated machine that will work properly given the right procedures are taken out for it - everyone has a different approach that will work for them 
‚Ä¢DUST / DUST MITES - heres an allergy that i still have to this day (it has improved). Dust and Dust mites are almost everywhere, on your bedding, floor, carpets, in the air and on all the furniture in your house (i know its scary to think) you can get rid of a certain amount of these dust mites, if your skin is super inflamed id suggest washing bedding and changing it at least once to twice a week (up to you) rinsing it twice each time to remove remaining traces of soap (if your allergic), next we have dust in other areas of your house if you have a hoover then hoover around corners and the floors of your room / house to make sure theres as little dust as you can, consider investing in a good hoover if you can - alternatively using a damp cloth on any surface gets up dust very effectively just make sure you dry it with a towel straight after to prevent mould from forming- you can just do this in your bedroom if you don‚Äôt have the time or effort to do the whole house and if your really unmotivated politely ask a loved one to help out (explain why and they may be open to helping you)
one thing you may want to consider investing in is a air filter (you can get a cheap one i only use a cheap one and have never changed the filter just clean it every so often but it works great) as it may help to keep circulation around your room which means less dust - also keep a very small gap in your window open when in your room as this also helps.
‚Ä¢AIR POLLUTION - whether you live in a busy city, town or village or right by a junction / busy road air-pollution may be a factor to consider and for some it may be a trigger for your skin, id suggest avoiding really busy places as much as you can (it may be un avoidable) and alternatively finding some time to go somewhere less polluted if there is anywhere available even a local park can be really good for you to visit for a walk in your free time as the plants / trees absorb air pollution and make the air cleaner also even indoor places like clubs, bars, restaurants, raves etc can have air pollution in the form of steam / heat / air fresheners that may be irritating to your skin health so just consider these factors.

HYGIENE:
this is another big topic so ill make a few points on hygiene and why it is important to have a routine:
‚Ä¢INFECTION - Skin that is open / broken can be easily infected by a build up of bacterias which is not good and can worsen if left completely untreated, to prevent this from happening you should keep your skin clean and dry using products that your skin doesn‚Äôt react badly to and for some people the best products may be a fragrance free soap i have used one before in times where my skin was infected (be careful how often you use it as it can do harm if too much is applied) as of now i don‚Äôt use any soaps at all but if you want to use soaps or find one that works for you then don‚Äôt give up and keep trying them - for some people no soap is the better option as some of us are hyper sensitive.
‚Ä¢ROUTINE - Different people have different preferences and we all react differently so experiment with your routine, if you shower twice a day try taking baths instead or try reducing the amount of showers experiment with the temperature (colder the better) as hot water is the last thing your inflamed skin needs as it will worsen inflammation and dry the skin out, if showering is too painful then take a towel and dip it is cold / warm water then use it to wipe yourself clean and then dry with a dry towel (worked for me in my worst flare ups) as its less impact / water contact for your skin and can help keep you clean without hurting your skin as much.
‚Ä¢SOAP - I‚Äôve mentioned previously in the infection section but we are all different and there may be a soap that works for your skin it also may be time to try not using soap if your skin is reacting to soaps then it could be one of the missing links to heal so be honest with yourself and experiment with different soaps ideally find fragrance free natural soap as its less likely to irritate your skin.

 ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT:
alternative medicines can work for many people despite not all being medically researched or backed by doctors they can be anything from coffee enemas, salt flushes, natural supplements, plant oils and capsules. There are a lot of different options here so the main things i can suggest is do your research and please do not try multiple at once as you will not be able to tell which one is impacting your skin or which one isn‚Äôt so take a journal and be patient - note down changes in your health.

PRESCRIPTION TREATMENT:
they can work for many people temporarily; in some cases they do not work, there are many different prescribed medications so make sure you check the side effects and safe dose with your GP, it also doesn‚Äôt hurt to research any meds your going to take or are thinking about taking as sometimes doctors give outdated advice or simply the wrong advice in terms of medication (its happened to me several times so just watch out for it) different treatments can include:
MEDICATIONS:
‚Ä¢corticosteroids
‚Ä¢immunosuppressants
‚Ä¢antihistamines
‚Ä¢antibiotics
they come in different forms depending on prescription (injections, tablets, capsules, liquids, syrups, creams, lotions, gels, eyedrops and nasal sprays)
THERAPIES / TESTING:
‚Ä¢light therapy
‚Ä¢allergy testing (food/environmental)
‚Ä¢patch testing (contact triggers)

ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE:
having eczema can make exercising frequently very difficult depending on severity however it is very important you get movement in as frequent as you can in any form even if its walking outside or on a treadmill at a gym or even if you have no access to that consider light aerobics, stretching / yoga or weight lifting (can be light weights at low intensity so it doesn‚Äôt irritate your skin. Work your way up slowly but set achievable goals and meet them as best as you can 

CLOTHING:
Even your clothes can effect your eczema for some its best to wear loose clothing however this is down to what feels the most comfortable to your body and skin so do whats best for you.
You may even be allergic to certain dyes and materials found in your clothes so consider changing the clothes you wear try out 100% cotton, silk or even bamboo may be an option for you, i wear bamboo t shirts and cotton pants / hoodies most of the time as they are the most comfortable for my skin but you may be different so see for yourself.

DIET:
We all react differently to different foods and for some of us many foods make our eczema worse, typical trigger foods include:
cocoa, sugar, dairy, eggs, salicylates, oxalates, mustard, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes and nightshades (tomatoes / potatoes) also citrus can be very triggering for some of us. 
Allergy testing for food allergies can be useful however it is not 100% accurate and does not detect food sensitivities as they aren‚Äôt the same as allergies and it also does not necessarily give a definite answer to which foods are triggering you for example a test may say your only allergic to peanuts while other foods may still trigger you without you being allergic to them such as sugar. Its confusing if you dont understand it entirely ill explain what you can do with your diet to help your skin..
‚Ä¢AVOID SUGAR AND PROCESSED FOODS:
as much as you reasonably can the less of these foods you eat the better it will be for your skin health
‚Ä¢AVOID SNACKING TOO MUCH:
constantly eating food is not ideal for your gut or skin health and can impact your mental health and stress your system which will impact your skin.
‚Ä¢BE KIND TO YOURSELF:
we are all human and make mistakes but if you do slip up and cheat on your diet then be kind to yourself and remember you can turn it back around if you try really hard to stop and not spiral into binging.
‚Ä¢CONSIDER ELIMINATION DIETS:
eliminating trigger foods can be the missing link in many of our cases and it can completely change your life if you find an elimination diet that works, there are many to consider trying that may work for you such as low histamine diet, low carb diet, keto or carnivore / animal based diet; all of which can work for different people but its important to let your doctor know what your doing and also to monitor your bio markers for inflammation across the body, this includes; sleep, mood, hunger, energy and drive / motivation (all of which can improve with the right dietary changes) which when improved will improve your skin too

SUMMARY: 
healing is a very challenging thing to do so be kind on yourself and remember than every failure / mistake is just a lesson in disguise, when we are learning any skill in life it is almost impossible to get it perfect on your first try, good luck to everyone of you and thank you for reading.",1,1744276942.0,u_Excellent_College984,0,1.0,False

I have friends, yeah, but they‚Äôre either married, far away, or just wouldn‚Äôt really get it. Can‚Äôt exactly tell this to my parents either.

I‚Äôm 34. We were together for 8 years. Met at work ‚Äî I had just started in tech support at a big company, she was in a different department. At first we just chatted during lunch breaks, then started hanging out after shifts.

She wasn‚Äôt some movie-perfect girl, but she was real. Down to earth, calm, didn‚Äôt freak out over small stuff. Loved old comedies, hated spicy food, laughed out loud at dumb TV shows.

Back then I was renting a tiny one-bedroom, she still lived with her parents. A year in, she moved in with me. Two years later, we got a place together with a mortgage. Everything was moving like it‚Äôs supposed to.

Kids? We talked about it. She‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúNot yet, maybe later.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt push. We both worked, took vacations once a year, made coffee on weekends, talked about saving up for a new car. It was... normal.

Sure, we fought. Everyone does. I could be distant, she could be sharp. But we always made up. Slept next to each other, she‚Äôd kiss my forehead to wake me up in the mornings. I thought we were solid.

Then, last November, things started shifting. I was working remotely, she was back at the office after COVID. Started staying late, saying there was a new project, a demanding boss. I believed her.

But I started noticing her phone was always in her hands, smiling at messages, hiding conversations. One time I half-joked, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs keeping you so entertained over there?‚Äù She just said, ‚ÄúA coworker, he sends dumb memes.‚Äù

I let it go.

Then one day she left her phone on the table while I was getting ready for a shower. It buzzed. I didn‚Äôt mean to, but I saw the name. Not someone I knew. Message had a smiley. I didn‚Äôt touch it, just remembered the name.

Later, I Googled it. Matched a local marketing coach from another city.

A week later, she says she‚Äôs going on a weekend ‚Äútraining‚Äù ‚Äî in that same city.

That‚Äôs when my stomach dropped. No panic, just this cold, sinking feeling. I said, ‚ÄúOkay, sure, go.‚Äù

Took a day off work, drove there myself. Sat in my car. That evening I watched her walk out of a hotel with the guy. Holding hands.

I didn‚Äôt confront her. Just drove back, didn‚Äôt sleep all night. Next morning, packed a bag, left a note:

*‚ÄúI saw you. Don‚Äôt call. Don‚Äôt text. I need time.‚Äù*

She called that same night. Then again. I didn‚Äôt answer.

Couple days later I went back to get more stuff ‚Äî she was in the kitchen, sitting in the corner, crying, trying to say something. I just said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. It‚Äôs done.‚Äù

It‚Äôs been 4 months now.

She messages sometimes. Says she was in a ‚Äúbad place,‚Äù ‚Äúlooking for support,‚Äù ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mean to destroy anything.‚Äù Says the guy didn‚Äôt work out. That he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt who he seemed to be.‚Äù

And I‚Äôm sitting here thinking ‚Äî how does that even work? Eight years. Shared bills, a home, vacations, nights she got sick and I stayed up, nights I was anxious and she held my hand.

And all that can just be dropped for a weekend with a stranger?

I‚Äôm living with my brother now. Working. Surviving. I guess I‚Äôm okay.

But sometimes I‚Äôm standing in the grocery store, holding a loaf of bread, and it hits me ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore.

I really thought I had a home.

Anyway. Just needed to get this out.

Not letting age stop me right now.,"I have always been active since I was 15, mostly doing endless steady state cardio, running half marathons and 1 full one in 2019 and HIIT. But nothing got me close to my ultimate dream of getting a six packs. But I‚Äôve started taking lifting more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù for about 10 months and really zone into my ‚Äúclean‚Äù diet to make it even cleaner since about 2 months and I can definitely feel the difference. Now I don‚Äôt really do so much cardio since my job is really physical so I let work take care of the cardio and legs mostly, and just focus on upper body mostly. I have not done any specific abs or core workout, which I know I should but I hate doing it. So I‚Äôm pretty surprised to see the sides of my abs sometimes. I work out 5-6x a week, 45-1hr each session. 

I fill half my dinner plate with fresh salad, and the rest with protein and carbs. 1,800-2,300 calories a day. Not trying to ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù; more like recomping for the time being because I don‚Äôt want to eat too little for energy‚Äôs sake and I can‚Äôt sleep well when I‚Äôm hungry. I start eating around 11:30am, then 3pm and then 6-7pm. My last small meal is usually at 10/11pm. I hardly snack just because I never had that habit. I stopped drinking coffee because I was so addicted to it, drinking at least 6-7 cups a day. Now I just drink Starbucks protein latte which is technically coffee but it doesn‚Äôt even give me any buzz. 

My weakness is fries and potatoes in general. I eat minimum 2 bowls of rice when I do, which is like 2-4x a month (can‚Äôt just have 1). I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcheat day‚Äù. I just regard my bowl of fries and rice as mine. No sweet tooth, just really into salty and savoury things so a huge slab of ribeye steak is probably it. I try to eat it maybe 1x a month. It‚Äôs mostly chicken, tempeh, eggs and fish for most of the days.

I was wondering if there is anyone here who can help me to tell me what it's like being a transwoman in Uruguay, especially Montevideo. 

I know on paper, it's great. The laws etc. are all progressive. But are the people? Because I live in Portugal currently (I'm not Portuguese, but speak it fluently) and although the laws look super liberal and progressive, the reality is very very different. This is an extremely conservative country with 20% of the population being far-right and agreeing with the Trump-loving CHEGA party and hating on ""woke"" every chance they get. Then another 30-40% are centre-right and will probably swing further right at the drop of a hat, because they value ""traditional Christian family values"".

That leaves a small percentage of really liberal people, who are my friends circle. But even they, the allies, they are telling me that because I am a business owner, I cannot be openly trans because people will stop coming to my shop. 

So, I have always been obsessed with all things Uruguay, even before I realized I was a woman and wanted to transition. I love Uruguayan cinema and literature, and I identify with that character. So, I am not the kind who is loud and flamboyant, just quietly flamboyant and confident. I am an extroverted introvert, and my idea of a good night is drinking one or two glasses of wine, lotsa coffee and mate, and discussing Bola√±o, Onetti, Peri Rossi, poetry, and socialism. Everyone likes a good dance in a bit of a louder place every now and again, but I'm mostly the kind of person who keeps myself to myself until I trust people and can let my hair down with good friends.

So, are Uruguayans really genuinely tolerant and not just performative like many Portuguese? (please don't think I am hating on the Portuguese, I have many good friends here, but any Portuguese people reading this will know exactly what I mean). Also, I prefer Uruguay's informed consent system for HRT, rather than Portugal's required gender dysphoria diagnosis..

I‚Äôm tired of seeing AEs make double my salary when I have better discovery and sales skills than them.

I‚Äôm frustrated with the lack of personal touch at scale, making genuine connections feel impossible.

I‚Äôm tired of being handed garbage leads and told to ‚Äúmake magic happen.‚Äù 

Tired of rejection that feels personal no matter how much they tell you not to take it that way.

Tired of quotas that feel like a setup for failure and tools that barely work when you need them most.

Tired of:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs align on priorities.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs circle back.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs touch base.‚Äù

Touch what? A spreadsheet? My last nerve?

I didn‚Äôt sign up for this to become a calendar puppet or an CRM monkey. 

I wanted freedom, meaning, something real. 

Instead, I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of activity mistaken for progress and noise mistaken for impact.

I‚Äôm not writing this for applause. Or a ‚Äúhang in there, champ.‚Äù

I‚Äôm writing this because I know I‚Äôm not the only one.

Not sure what‚Äôs next for me yet. But I know it‚Äôs not this. 

If you‚Äôve found a way out, something that makes you feel alive again without selling your soul for a 15-minute meeting, tell me.

Because I‚Äôm not afraid of hard work. 

I‚Äôm afraid of waking up five years from now and not recognizing myself anymore.

What would you do?

I‚Äôve been into pour over coffee for quite a while and have finally got to grips with ratios, weights, grind size, pour speed and all the usual variables. It has been a really fun and rewarding learning curve. Recently, I decided it was time to branch out and start learning the art of espresso.

My girlfriend recently gifted me a Sage Bambino (not the Plus) and I‚Äôve been having a great time experimenting and figuring things out. After reading a few threads here, it became clear that I‚Äôd need a few extra tools to get the most out of the machine, so I picked up the following:

[Link to my set up - what's missing?](https://imgur.com/a/gkRbN2o)

* Bottomless portafilter (54mm)
* IMS Precision Filter Basket (54mm)
* NEOUZA 53mm spring-loaded tamper
* Dosing funnel
* WDT tool

I already had a semi-decent electric grinder (AMZCHEF) and a 0.1g scale with timer, so I felt fairly well-equipped to get started.

One thing I‚Äôve realised I haven‚Äôt given much thought to is cups and glasses. Right now I‚Äôm just using whatever‚Äôs clean, but I‚Äôve started to wonder if there‚Äôs anything I should consider when it comes to size, shape or material. Would love any advice or suggestions on what‚Äôs worth picking up for espresso and milk drinks alike.

**Why I‚Äôm here:**  
I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice from those of you with more experience, especially on the following:

1. **Pulling decent shots**¬†‚Äì I‚Äôm still figuring out puck prep and shot consistency, so any tips or routines that helped you in the beginning would be hugely appreciated. I checked the guide, but if there are any personal tips specific to the Bambino, I'd love to hear them.
2. **Machine maintenance**¬†‚Äì I want to look after my Bambino properly, so I‚Äôd love to hear what sort of cleaning or maintenance you recommend.
3. **General beginner advice**¬†‚Äì Are there any common mistakes to avoid? Or small changes that made a big difference to your results?

My girlfriend is especially excited about the potential for latte art. I‚Äôm personally not too fussed about milk-based drinks, although I do enjoy the occasional cortado so I want to learn this too.

Looking forward to learning more and becoming part of the community.

Please give me some advice.,"Sorry in advance for a long read. I'll keep it as short as possible without missing any important detail. Please bear with me. 

So, there's this girl(25f). She and I(26M) have been really close friends for about 4 years'. Her mother also knows about me. 

She has been in one relationship in her life and that was with a potential pedophile. She was 16-17 and he was 25-26 when they started dating. They have had sex 10-15 times within the first year they started dating. She was a minor during that time. He was a control freak to say the least. And she was just a kid. He ruined her life. 


She didn't even get to be in her dream college and get her dream education because apparently there were boys in that college and he didn't 'allow' her to take admission in that college and forced her to be in all girls college. That college didn't even had that subject she wanted to take. She had to take some random bachelors degree that was available in that college. 


So after 4 years of dating, they finally broke up. Oh did i mention he didn't even let her have any social media except WhatsApp? So yeah after break up, first thing she did was she made accounts on Instagram and stuff. And that's how we met. We live in different cities but not very far. Needless to say, we became very close because i had some relationship traumas of my own. 

Even though we're very close, we don't meet with each other that much. And when we do, it's just usually for like 20-30 minutes. Some coffee and stuff. But i always had that feeling that she's hiding something very big from me. 

So here's the main part. Several months ago, she told me that they were shifting from their house to rent because they want to rebuild their home. Nothing suspicious right? But whenever i used to ask about when will they start rebuilding their house, she just used to brush it off and changed the topic. I always had my suspicions. 

So very recently, I just couldn't take it anymore and straight up asked her what's happening and if there's anything she need to tell me. After insisting a bit, she told me and just started crying. Her father's a gambler and he lost all of their life savings on gambling. He still doesn't stop gambling and throw away all of his salary on it. He comes home drunk everyday at 1-2 am after losing in gambling and you know the rest. She said she just wanted to marry after her studies (2 years left) and be done with that house. And it just broke me inside. I didn't know what to say. We haven't talked on this topic ever since. 

I've been thinking these past weeks about how i can help her. Like i come from a rich family background and I've a pretty good job. I can easily help her with whatever amount of money she needs for her studies and rebuilding their home. But i know she won't take it. Anyone with any pride in them won't take it. She hasn't asked for a single penny from me all these years so I know that she won't take my help. 

We haven't been intimate with each other. But i know for a fact that she has feelings for me and I know i have feelings for her. We just haven't put a label on it. And i was thinking maybe it is time to do so. I have made up my mind and it is NOT a rushed decision. I've been thinking about it for weeks. I want to ask her to marry me but i don't want to lose her in the process. Also i don't want her to think that I'm doing it out of sympathy for her because I'm not. I'm SO in love with her.


 Please some grown ups and mature people, give me some advice. How should i proceed with it or should i even do it? ",16,1744275346.0,OffMyChestIndia,18,0.94,False

And somehow in the lead up to this painful date approaching, I've traced my steps back to the places I'd been before we met and during our relationship. Last weekend, I visited the coffee shop you ended us in, before moving to the library I worked in the day of the breakup, where you tried to kiss me before we both headed to work in the morning to pretend everything was okay, us both knowing that it wasn't. If I had kissed you more passionately that morning, would we be together celebrating today? Or was the mask crumbling too much that it was simply just a bomb waiting to implode on our lives.

I walked through the park we'd meet to read by the river, where I'd rest on your chest and watch the world go by. Walked the route home id cycle on my bike before my injury to ride to yours, when seeing you was exciting, new and so much opportunity lay before us. I used to know that route like the back of my hand, but now, it feels strange and unsafe. Like someone else's path i no longer wish to follow. I hoped id see you passing by but at the same time feared it happening, stuck between my longing for you and my mind wishing you away, which i know is a sign of healing. would you be walking past or driving through? Still there was no trace of you around. Everything is still the same as it was before, but you're just not in it anymore. I visited these places before you came into my world, and now you're a memory tainted on them. How do I reclaim back the parts of my life you invaded without the crippling pain of your absence?

This week, I drove down to the place we last went on holiday. Its my favourite surf spot, and I shared it with you, taught you to stand on a board, helped you pick out the gear. I stayed with a friend in the area who spent the day with us when we were last visiting the area, our last holiday before the split, the same friends home I drove back from 2 years ago to meet you for our first date the next day. Yesterday I walked up to drive alone whilst my friend was out to remember loading up my old car exactly 2 years prior to the date, the one you encouraged me to sell (that I loved) and remembered the woman who didn't know this man, who was so full of confidence, independence, who simply wanted go on a date with a doctor because she thought the conversation might be interesting compared to the guy she was seeing prior who worked in insurance or the dude id hooked up with a few weeks prior who had set his ex girlfriends clothes on fire and shared the video. Back then you were nothing more than a profile picture. I was stronger back then to have walked away if I knew the man youd have become. Unfortunately that same girl had no idea what intense connection she'd discover 24 hours later, only to revisit the place 2 years later of the final day I had as that person before I met the man that broke me into a thousand pieces. 

Tonight, I'll be driving to the surf beach where we stayed in the water together until sunset, visiting the beach where I taught you to pop up. As I reclaim these places with new memories, I'll think of you, and wonder if today, on the day we met 2 years ago. Do you ever return to these places and think of me? Or have they been erased from your life like you erased me. Where they also a part of the mask you wore when you pretended it was real. 

I know it's likely I'll never see you again, but the ghost of you haunts me in every corner and path I take. As I rebuild back to the woman 2 years ago I was before I met you, I feel myself stripping you away, removing the layers of love, trust, memories, future, to leave behind only 2 people, single, emotionally damaged and trying to scramble to reclaim our former identities. Like the Lyrics to the Lord Huron song, the night we met, I leave you, my former lover, with this one our 2 anniversary. 

""I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met""

   **filtration Needs:** Identify the specific contaminants you want to remove from your water. Do you need to reduce chlorine, sediment, lead, or other impurities? Different filters offer different levels of filtration. Consider a reverse osmosis inline filter if you have serious contamination issues.
   **Flow Rate:** Ensure the filter's flow rate meets the demands of your appliance or fixture. A low flow rate can result in reduced water pressure.The inline water filter flow rate is an important specification to check.
   **Filter capacity:** Consider the filter's capacity, which indicates how much water it can filter before needing replacement. A higher capacity filter will require less frequent replacement.
   **Installation and Replacement:** Choose a filter that is easy to install and replace. Quick-connect fittings can simplify the installation process. The inline water filter installation process should be as painless as possible. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Regular inline water filter replacement ensures continued water quality.

   **Cost:** Compare the cost of different filters,including the initial purchase price and the cost of replacement cartridges. The inline water filter cost should be viewed in terms of long-term value.
   **Compatibility:** Ensure the filter is compatible with your appliance or plumbing system. Check the inline water filter dimensions to ensure it fits properly. The inline water filter connector and inline water filter fittings should match your existing plumbing.
   **Water Pressure:** Check the inline water filter pressure to ensure it's compatible with your systems water pressure. too much pressure can cause the filter to burst.

## Inline Water Filter Installation Guide: A Step-by-Step Overview

While specific installation instructions may vary depending on the filter model, here's a general overview of the inline water filter installation process:

*  **Turn off the Water Supply:** Locate the shut-off valve for the water line you'll be working on and turn it off.

*  **Disconnect the Water Line:** carefully disconnect the water line from the appliance or fixture.

*  **Install the Filter:** Connect the inlet side of the inline water filter to the water supply line, and the outlet side to the appliance or fixture. Use appropriate inline water filter fittings to ensure a secure and leak-proof connection.

*  **Secure Connections:** Use Teflon tape or pipe dope on the threads of the fittings to prevent leaks.

*  **Turn on the Water Supply:** Slowly turn on the water supply and check for leaks. Tighten fittings as needed.

*  **Flush the Filter:** Flush the filter according to the manufacturer's instructions to remove any air or debris.

## Maintaining Your Inline Water Filter: Tips for Longevity

Proper maintainance is essential for ensuring the optimal performance and longevity of your inline water filter. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

   **Replace Filter Cartridges Regularly:** Replace the filter cartridge according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This is crucial for maintaining water quality.
   **Inspect for Leaks:** Regularly inspect the filter and connections for leaks. Address any leaks promptly to prevent water damage.
   **Flush the Filter Periodically:** periodically flush the filter to remove sediment and debris.
   **Protect from Freezing:** Protect the filter from freezing temperatures, which can damage the filter housing.
   **Follow Manufacturer's instructions:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation, maintenance, and replacement.

Nobody taught me this at school.  
Or in my first job.  
Or even in my first few years of managing teams.

But eventually, it hit me:  
**If you don‚Äôt sell yourself, someone else decides your value.**  
Or worse ‚Äî no one notices what you‚Äôre worth at all.

Now, when I say ‚Äúsell yourself,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean turning into a self-promotional machine.  
No fake hype. No loud voices.  
I‚Äôm talking about something much simpler ‚Äî and more powerful:  
**Making your value visible. Every day.**

# You‚Äôre already doing it ‚Äî whether you know it or not

You ‚Äúsell‚Äù yourself more often than you think:  
‚Äì When you speak up in a meeting  
‚Äì When you write a message to your team  
‚Äì When you ask for help  
‚Äì When you pitch an idea  
‚Äì When you post something online  
‚Äì When you negotiate your salary

Most people don‚Äôt think of these moments as ‚Äúsales.‚Äù  
But every one of them shapes how others see you.

And here‚Äôs the thing:  
If you wait for the perfect moment to be noticed‚Ä¶  
You‚Äôll be waiting a long time.

# The mindset shift that changed everything

For a long time, I kept quiet. I thought my work would speak for itself.  
It didn‚Äôt.  
At least not loud enough.

So I started doing one small thing:  
**Telling short stories about what I did ‚Äî and why it mattered.**

Nothing flashy. Just clear, simple moments:

>

People started to listen differently.  
I didn‚Äôt become louder.  
I became clearer.

# But isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ arrogant?

This is the most common fear I hear:

>

And I get it. That fear is real.

But let me reframe it:  
**Selling yourself isn‚Äôt arrogance. It‚Äôs clarity. It‚Äôs confidence. It‚Äôs respect ‚Äî for yourself and your work.**

If you don‚Äôt lead your own narrative, others will fill in the blanks.  
And trust me, their version won‚Äôt be as generous.

# Start small. Build the habit.

You don‚Äôt need a personal brand or a social media strategy to start.

Here‚Äôs where I recommend you begin:  
‚Äì Reflect on one recent success  
‚Äì Boil it down into a short story  
‚Äì Practice telling it to a friend or writing it out

Make it a habit.  
Like brushing your teeth ‚Äî but for your professional self-worth.

# Final thought

The more you practice showing your value,  
the less it feels like ‚Äúselling‚Äù ‚Äî¬†  
and the more it feels like simply being yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for the world to notice.  
Help it understand who you are and what you bring.

**Question for you:**  
*What‚Äôs one small way you made your value visible today?*

But *at home*? Never enjoyed it as much. It always felt‚Ä¶ fine. Tolerable. Maybe a mood thing. Despite loving coffee, I never really bothered to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in it at home. I mean, why spend on fancy coffee when Nescaf√© Original does the job at perhaps one-fourth the price?

And then, a trip changed everything.

Went to a resort in a coffee estate. Casual conversations turned into revelations ‚Äî I learned that instant coffee (Nescaf√©, Bru, etc.) is mostly just coffee *dust*. It‚Äôs not real coffee. Try making an espresso or a black coffee with real beans or powder and you‚Äôll immediately know what I mean.

So I gave it a shot when I got back. Wow. Gamechanger.  
Suddenly, my kitchen coffee was leagues ahead of the overpriced sugary stuff I used to drink outside.

**Personal favorites now?**

* **Davidoff Caf√© Grande Cuvee** ‚Äì worth the price.
* **Rage Hazelnut** ‚Äì budget friendly & flavorful.
* **Sleepy Owl (almost all flavors)** ‚Äì excellent for cold brews too.

Now I make my own at home almost every time. I control how healthy vs tasty I want it to be. I keep almond milk, cocoa powder, both skim and full-fat milk. Want indulgence? Full-fat + cocoa + crushed Biscoff + ice. Want clean energy? Almond milk + a dash of cinnamon. You get the point. It‚Äôs fun.

I‚Äôve been debating getting a brewing machine and ground beans ‚Äî curious if that *next* step really levels things up again like it did when I ditched instant coffee.

If you're a coffee lover who only drinks outside, give this a try. You might enjoy it more *and* end up drinking fewer sugary, calorie-laden caf√© concoctions.

(Can skip reading, head to the question at the end)","I wanted to share something that‚Äôs been sitting with me for a while‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve only recently been able to put into words. I‚Äôve been part of this subreddit for some time now, and while I‚Äôve learned a lot from everyone here, I also get the sense that I might be younger than most of the community. So maybe my experiences won‚Äôt resonate with everyone but anyways here it goes.

I‚Äôm from the Mumbai metropolitan area, still a student and a day scholar‚Äîso a huge chunk of my daily life is spent commuting. Rickshaws, buses, locals‚Ä¶ all packed to the brim. Long queues, dying for a seat in local train, dodging the gutkha/tobacco gang, mentally muting those blasting reels on their phones trying to remain sane.   
  
But this commuting does give me a lot of time to think. And I keep circling back to this one question: How am I in any realistic or ethical sense expected to bring another life in this chaos? Overpopulated trains, construction/dust everywhere, noise pollution, labor exploitation, corruption, the constitution and democracy taken as a joke (recent comedian controversies), religious wars, and literally no value for human life (check for the number of people who die daily commuting in Mumbai locals) the list goes on and on and on...

I carried this unspoken pressure with me for a long time, like a background process running in my mind‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs how most of us are raised, right? You study for a third of your life, mostly learning things you‚Äôll never use, then you‚Äôre expected to get married, have kids, and start the cycle all over again. It‚Äôs treated like the default setting. I never felt the desire to follow that path. I do want a partner, someone to share life with‚Äîbut the idea of having and raising kids? Nope. Still, for the longest time, I kept questioning myself. Wondering if something was wrong with me. Everyone around me seemed so sure, so ready to follow the pre-written script.

It wasn‚Äôt until I fell down a few internet rabbit holes and did some serious self-reflection that I realized I‚Äôm not alone. There are people like me‚Äîliving differently, and yes, happily too. Happiness means different things to different people, but I can safely say they aren‚Äôt stressing about paying lakhs for kindergarten fees or waking up at 3 AM to calm a screaming infant. That‚Äôs when it really clicked for me: I‚Äôve never once seen a couple with a child and thought, *‚ÄúI want that someday.‚Äù* Not even once. And from that moment on, I stopped second-guessing myself.

Choosing to be childfree has given me something I didn‚Äôt even know I needed, the space **to just be**. To exist without the pressure of raising another life when I‚Äôm still figuring out my own. I don‚Äôt have all the answers about what I want or how I want to live, but now I at least have the freedom to explore that without a constant sense of urgency. I spend my time on my terms now, falling asleep with a book, taking a little extra time to brew my coffee, geek out on astronomy, watch my favourite shows, lazy afternoon naps. I let myself go down rabbit holes when I discover a piece of interesting media, I learn new skills when I feel inspired, and sometimes I just observe... butterflies, street cats, trees and flowers, life in general. The breeze, the sound of water, my favorite songs, dancing around my room for no reason at all, it‚Äôs all mine to enjoy without guilt.

Most importantly, I‚Äôve let go of that invisible weight‚Äîthe one that says I need to live life at a frantic pace just to build some generational wealth for a ‚Äúfuture family.‚Äù That‚Äôs not my path, and that‚Äôs okay. Of course, there‚Äôs still work, responsibilities, taxes, and the usual hustle of survival and I work hard for that... but somehow the stress has eased. My life feels lighter, more intentional, and far more mine.

1jvt1rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFVfood/comments/1jvt1rr/my_valley_restaurant_list/,My valley restaurant list.,"Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/1juvv5w/can_we_get_a_good_food_list_going_for_the_valley/) post in r/SVF, I wanted to share my thoughts on some of my favorite eateries across the valley. If you agree with any of these please say so in a reply to give a shoutout those local businesses, and of course if you have a place to add to the list go ahead and leave a comment, but please include a review or description as to why you like that place.

And if you disagree with any of my reviews too, I'd also love to hear why (except for Lal Mirch having the best naans, I'll die on that hill). /s

I'm leaving off all the well known ones like Petit Trois, or Anajak Thai and the super popular like Portos or beloved places that might be prominent in the valley but also have many location outside the valley like Zankou.

**Vinh Loi Tofu - vegan Vietnamese, Reseda.** Great Banh Mi Sandwiches, great noodle salad, you won't even miss the meat. This place always makes the list of best vegan restaurants in the valley and often makes the list of just best restaurants in the valley. Give it a try even if you aren't vegan.

**Borekas Sephardic Pastries - Israel pastries, Sherman Oaks (and soon Tarzana).** Savory filled pastries served with pickles, tomato sauce, hot sauce and a hard boiled egg. Warm, flaky, delicious there is a reason people line up for them. My favorite is the Za'atar and Cheese. Good Turkish coffee too.

**Woodlands Indian - Chatsworth.** This place does Southern Indian food so it's a bit different from the curry and tandoori style Indian Food a lot of people are probably most familiar with. Their specialty is dosa, a kind of crepe made with lentil flour with savory filling inside. Everything here tastes so good and the people running the place are super warm and friendly. Should note that its a vegetarian restaurant but don't let that put you off just cause you're not vegetarian. I'm not vegetarian and I still love it!

**Tel Aviv Grill - Mediterranean, Encino, North Hollywood &, Woodland Hills.** Best chicken Shawarma and Falafel in LA. Prices might seem high but the portions are huge, my girlfriend and I will go here for lunch, split one plate between us and still be taking home leftovers. I recommend the stuffed pita if you are just ordering for yourself and even that will be more than enough food because it comes with fries and fried eggplant. A friend I took there described the ordering process as one of the most chaotic and aggressive he's ever experienced. He's only partially wrong. They have great hummus too.

**Pho Viet Cali - Vietnamese, Reseda.** Great pho and other soups but I go there for their Bun (cold vermicelli noodle plate).

**Valley Sandwiches - Banh Mi, Reseda.** I used to call this my suspiciously cheap Banh Mi place. Prices have since risen but its still a deal and the sandwiches are great. Honorable mention goes to **Sandwich Express** around the corner from them.

**RJM Grill - Mexican, Sunland.** Don't let the decor (or lack of it) or the fact that its next to a gas station fool you, this place is seriously good food and at incredibly reasonable prices. I usually go for just two tacos, but I've never had anything there that isn't great or seen anything being served there that didn't look amazing. It's a favorite lunch spot of set dressers as it near by a lot of prop houses. This place is seriously flying under the radar, I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it. Be warned service there can be slow and you might wait awhile for your food to arrive. It's worth the wait but not a place to eat if you have to be somewhere afterwards.

**Ay Papi Que Rico - Grilled Chicken/ Mexican, multiple locations.** Pollo al carbon is the deal here. It's juicy it's tender, it delicious. Get the half chicken plate served with rice and beans (choice of black or pinto) tortillas and grilled jalapeno. Or get the chicken burrito which is basically all of the above wrapped in a tortilla and in a (slightly) more reasonable portion size.

**Lou the French - Pastries, Toulca Lake.** What's to say? They do French pastries, they are buttery and flakey. My friends claim their almond croissant is the best one they've ever had. Almond is not my favorite flavor of croissant so I'll have to take their word on it. Their sandwiches look good too but I've not had them yet.

**The Little Izaka-ya - Sushi, Sherman Oaks.** Every time we eat here my girlfriend and I joke that we are taking advantage of them. We'll usually get 4 or 5 rolls between us, mochi ice cream for desert, a soda and end up spending around $60... including tip! Cozy atmosphere, good sushi. Sitting at the sushi bar is fun too.

**Kai Ramen -  Sherman Oaks.** All their soup is good. You're in the valley and want ramen, go here. Honorable mention to **Nippon Reman** **in Reseda,** a personal favorite of mine and a place that does miso broth in stead of the usual tonkotsu.

**Lal Mirch - Indian, Studio City.** My favorite Indian in LA! I usually go with one of their curries. Their mango tikka masala and their vegetable korma are their most outstanding ones in my opinion.  They don't have a liquor license but will let you BYOB, they will even keep your beers cold for you in their fridge if you ask, and no corking fees or anything like that. BEST NAAN IN ALL OF LA, I'll fight you on that one.

**Domingo's - Italian Deli, Encino/Tarzana.** I don't understand why more people aren't talking about this place. Hot or cold their sandwiches are great, and their homemade ciabatta is wonderful. I went there with a friend once, he ordered the meatball sub. He then got all quiet as he ate and I thought he wasn't liking it. Turns out he wasn't hating it, he was just speechless. When he finished he had the look of someone who just had a spiritual awakening and said ""that was the best meatball sub I've had in my entire life."" Yes this is an overly dramatic review but every word of it is true.

**Mizlala - Mediterranean, Sherman Oaks.** a slightly bougier take on Mediterranean but non the less delicious. Skip the shawarma, go for the grilled chicken instead, great falafel too (my 2nd favorite in the city).

**Sri Siam - Thai, North Hollywood.** Thai food done well by nice people, what more do you want? Order anything you want off the menu, everything is good here.

**Kop Jai Lai - Thai/Laotian, Mission Hills.** I like this place because while its got your standard fare Thai dishes it's also got some Laotian ones that you just don't come across often. If you like Thai food but are looking to mix it up a little, order off the Laotian Specials section of their menu. The sausage was a favorite of mine.

**Kinnara Thai - Van Nuys.** You're standard Thai menu but done well, give it a try. Set Dresser approved.

**Rustic Spoon - Thai, NoHo/Toulca Lake.** Best green curry in Los Angeles! Seriously if you love green curry this is your spot. All their other dishes are great too but the green curry is where it's at. When I order it I don't even get it with chicken or tofu or any protein, that would just leave less room for all that delicious Japanese pumpkin and eggplant. They recently added yellow curry noodle to their menu and their version just might be my favorite of that dish too.

**Healthyca - Salads and Sandwiches, NoHo Arts District.** Poorly named, but great food. I go here for their sandwiches but most people talk about their salads. Their New Sicilian on wheat ciabatta is my go-to, when choosing your side go straight to their quinoa salad, I absolutely love it.

**Hy Mart Sandwiches - Mediterranean wraps, NoHo Arts District.** Mediterranean wraps made by the nicest people you will meet. It's the type of place where I almost always order something different when I go, and it's all been great.

**El Cocinero - Vegan Mexican, Van Nuys.** I don't care if you're not vegan, just go try this place! This should be on every list of best Mexican spots in Los Angeles (notice how I how I didn't say list of best VEGAN Mexican spots?). People eat here and walk out refusing to believe its not really meat. Put their carne asada up against anyone's else's in the city and its a toss up as to who comes up on top.

**Leonor's - Vegan Mexican, North Hollywood.** A bit of a lighter take on Vegan Mexican food than the one listed above but nonetheless delicious. Want some Mexican for lunch but don't want the following food coma, or just want to be a bit heathier. This is your place.

**Cemitas Poblanas Don Adrian - Mexican Sandwich, Van Nuys.** No, not tortas, the other type of Mexican sandwich, I particularly like their one with lamb. Crunchy bun, tasty fillings plus cheese and avocado. Go get one after your next appearance at the Van Nuys courthouse, if you're walking out of there on your own that is.

**Tarzana Armenian Deli - Pita Wraps, Tarzana.** The vibe is like an Italian deli but with an Armenian twist and pita wraps instead of sandwiches. Get the Lahmajun wrap, you won't be disappointed.

**Baja Subs - Sri Laken, Northridge.** I don't know what's up with the name, I always mean to ask but then I'm so caught up in enjoying the food I forget. For years I drove past this place with its faded sign before I even learned it was a Sri Lankan spot. The sign used to just say ""Baja Sub Mexican Grill."" They've updated the signage recently to one that give more of Southern Indian vibe, but kept the confusing name. What this place lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for in flavor. This could be the most flavorful food in the valley! Be warned though, when they ask you if you are OK with spice it can get seriously spicy!

**Mariscos Corona - Mexican seafood, Van Nuys.** Excellent ceviche and good standard fare Mexican food. Oh, and seafood soups. I've not ordered it personally yet but their 7 Mares soup looked particularly impressive.

**Tonir Cafe - Armenian Mediterranean, Burbank.** Yes I know Armenia is not on the Mediterranean, but its got good kabab plates and reasonable prices, also a selection of interesting Armenian Sodas, all from a friendly locally owned restaurant. Another favorite lunch spot of Set Dressers and off-production studio workers.

**Tender Grill - Persian, San Fernando.** Ok so I'm putting this one on the list for one dish and one dish alone. I'm not going to vouch for anything else on the menu (it's fine, but just fine) but their Beef Lule is amazing! I might even put their beef lule up against Mini Kebob's one, seriously.

**Follow Your Heart - Canoga Park.** A gem of the west valley. A health food store with a cafe inside. The store might be dripping with hippie-dippy kombucha and chakra aligning crystals vibes, but the restaurant is legit. I've not bothered to explore much of the menu here, I always go straight for the chicken pot pie.

**King Burger, Got Sushi - Burgers and Sushi (duh), Northridge.** The greatest crossover event since... well you know the meme. There is a good story behind the mashup if you care to look it up, but I'll just say this, they do burgers well and they do sushi well and it work together in a way you wouldn't expect. Got that one guy in your friend group that just won't try sushi? Well come here and now there is an option for everyone! Or just come here cause you want good sushi, or cause you want good burgers, or cause you couldn't decide and who says you can't have both?

**The Local Peasant - Gastropub, Woodland Hills & Sherman Oaks.** Good food and good beers. Their burger is good but their fried chicken sandwich is better, pretty good fish and chips too, and a good beyond burger for your vegie/vegan friends. Skip the fries (although they are good) instead go for the potato crisps with the malt vinegar spray bottle. Oh and they have Pliny on tap.

**Hanks Bagels - Sherman Oaks & Toulca Lake.** I always enter this place thinking its just way too much to spend on a bagel sandwich (and maybe it is), but their lox are just so good I end up leaving thinking its worth it, and that's coming from someone who never ever felt that strongly about lox, and now theirs are the only lox I like.

**Lum Ka Naad - Thai, Northridge, Encino & Sherman Oaks.** Normally I'd be weary of any restaurant with a menu as long as this. It's usually the case that a long menu means they might do most things ok, but they don't do anything that great. Well happily that's not the case here. What I like about this place is their menu is split into northern and southern Thai dishes which means you'll see dishes that you just don't find on most Thai restaurant menus. My favorite is their Kang Ho off the Northern Cuisine part of the menu.

**Oi Asian Fusion - Filipino? Indonesian? Malaysian? a bit of Korean too? - Canoga Park.** Not sure which best describes their food, the ignorant American in me (even though I'm English) would probably label it as Filipino, but they really are living up to the Asian fusion part of their their name, incorporating flavors from many regions. Rice bowls and buns are their schtick. Get pork bun, it's the best but all the rice bowls are good so take your pick. It's a place easily looked over in their strip mall location and probably why it doesn't get as much buzz as it deserves but worth it for those who take notice.

**Furnsaj - Mediterranean Granada Hills.** I'll be honest this is not my favorite Mediterranean place, but don't take that as any kind of negative review, just cause its not my favorite doesn't mean it's still not great. I like their lamb gyro and their chicken shawarma, I usually go for a wrap but they do a half gyro/half shawarma plate that I'm always tempted to get if only it weren't so much food! Why can't they do a 50/50 wrap!?!

**Pizza Wagon of Brooklyn - Sherman Oaks.** Ok, I'll acknowledge the controversy I'm potentially stirring bringing up a pizza place, especially one that's using a New York borough in its name. But you know what? I like pizza and I like a lot of different types of pizza. I like NY style pizza, I like Chicago deep dish pizza, I like California style pizza topped with shit like figs and goat cheese, I even like Detroit style pizza (come at me bro!). My point is, quit your pizza gatekeeping and just go eat it, it's good.

**Mambos - Cuban, Burbank.** Get the roast pork. I don't have a long review for this one except to say they do everything well but I think their roast pork is the best. I guess they do jazz nights in the evenings but I've only ever been there for lunch. Seems like an awkward setup to do a jazz night but maybe someone who has been to one can chime in. Also on a completely random tangent and completely unrelated to food, every time I walk out of here I notice the H.P. Lovecraft Museum, across the street but I've yet to visit there. Good fired plantains too.

**La Bamba - Cuban Burbank.**  La Bamba is a Cuban restaurant named after a song by Mexican-American singer songwriter Richie Valens, who was not Cuban, which itself was based on a Mexican folk song which was also not Cuban. Perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on the fame of nearby Pacoima's native son? Naming choices aside they offer tasty Cuban cuisine and al fresco dining.",6,1744274177.0,SFVfood,3,1.0,False

Something about Phuket aligned very well with is the kind of people we see, the vibe, the atmosphere and everything else just seems to be calling me and my gf to shift there. 

Was always a fan of starting a cozy people gathering coffee shop & shopping experience and the coffee culture on Thailand is a big hit same as shopping. 

Initially looking to stay there for 3 months to understand the people, economics, do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts, business environment for foreigners and much more came to reddit to get tips & tricks, suggestions, and much more in between. 

The plan is to open a coffee hub with a clothing store attached where you can experience the process of making clothes from the very scratch to the finish such as T-shirt, hoodies, bikini, personal accessories and much more, totally interested in connecting with everyone and create a community much bigger and larger than anyone could think of and ofc the coffee shop would also be a cute & cozy canna smoking & selling spot. 

To anyone who is reading this it‚Äôs a request to interact with the post and drop your feedback, suggestions, etc. 

Cheers!

Still, Somu‚Äôs company, ‚ÄúSkyNet Technologies‚Äù (which sounds like it sells missiles, but just makes HR apps), decides‚Äî‚ÄúAC should be off. Team bonding ke liye garam hawa chahiye.‚Äù

Somu arrives at office looking like the inside of a wet sock. His deodorant gave up halfway through Beliaghata. 

**Auto ride in summer = Sweaty Orgy Simulator.**  
Three random dudes, one sweaty bhodrolok with *kaajer bag*, one aunty who smells like ‚ÄúBoroline + Duronto Ride‚Äù.

**And the moment your thighs touch ‚Äî bhai,**  
*That‚Äôs not friction, that‚Äôs foreplay.*

The lift‚Äôs broken, so he walks six floors up, sweating from orifices he didn‚Äôt know existed. He enters. His manager, Dipu da‚Äîwho smells like Axe Chocolate and parental disappointment‚Äîsays:

‚ÄúSomu, Aj o late?‚Äù

Somu, mentally on a ghat with Rabindrasangeet playing, replies:

‚ÄúBolchi, ami jibon e ektu bhalo thakte chai.‚Äù

Everyone laughs.

Because this is corporate. And crying in the open is only for farewell speeches and layoffs.

Lunchtime. The office canteen serves boiled rice, mushy alu-bharta, and chicken curry that tastes like regret. Somu takes a bite and whispers:

‚ÄúEta chicken? Na life-e ekta bhool?‚Äù

Meanwhile, Sudeshna from HR, a girl who puts ""Summer baby ‚òÄÔ∏èüå∏"" in her Insta bio, is sipping iced Americano like she isn‚Äôt dying inside.

Somu looks at her and wonders tomra kon galaxy te thako?

He remembers once He saw a guy fainting in front of Lake Mall.  
Nobody helped.  
People thought it was a new Zomato marketing stunt‚Äî‚ÄúFall for our food.‚Äù

And then comes the breaking point.

3 PM. Power goes off.

UPS fails.

Sudeshna‚Äôs ring light dies.

The whole office becomes a Bengali horror film where the only ghost is Somu‚Äôs will to live.

In the heat-fueled delirium, Somu opens his secret desk drawer‚Äîwhere there‚Äôs no code, no vision doc.

Only‚ÄîOld Monk. Half bottle. Blessing of the gods.

One sip. Two sip. He sees Jesus. Jesus says ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôm melting too.‚Äù

Suddenly, Somu starts preaching like a madman:

‚ÄúSummer pashbalish-er moto‚Äîthake shorirer pashe, kichui kore na, just gorom lage.‚Äù

Dipu da stares.

Sudeshna asks, ‚ÄúSomu, are you drunk?‚Äù

Somu replies: ‚ÄúDrunk on truth. You summer babies are psychopaths. Toke jodi 2 July r dupure Howrah station e niye giye feli, tuio bolbi‚Äî‚Äòomg such a vibe.‚Äô""

The office gasps.

Somu is sweating, ranting, shirt half open like a Govinda fan on TikTok.

‚ÄúEta Season na. Eta punishment. Bro, even Feluda wouldn‚Äôt solve cases in this heat.  
He‚Äôd just be like:  
*‚ÄúTopshe, ami bhabchi‚Ä¶ eta suicide e chhilo.*  
*Je Kolkata e gormo e beriyechhilo... sei bhule giyachilo jibon er mullo*""

He throws a fan at the wall and shouts:

‚ÄúMonsoon ke boro korbe na, kintu Ice Americano kheye bujhchho tumi aesthetic?‚Äù

Dipu da tries to stop him. Somu points and screams:

‚ÄúDipu da, tumi shei dhoroner manus je chhuti dineo mail kore!‚Äù

Sudeshna is crying. HR logs in to Teams to file an incident report.

But then‚Ä¶ something magical happens.

The sky darkens.

A single thunder roars.

It starts raining.

Cold. Clean. Apocalyptic.

Everyone runs to the window.

Somu stands near the AC vent, arms stretched like Shah Rukh Khan in *DDLJ*.

Tears in his eyes. Sweat now holy water.

‚ÄúNature heard me,‚Äù he whispers.

A pigeon flies in and shits on Dipu da‚Äôs shoulder.

Poetic justice.

Later that evening, Somu gets a termination email.

But he walks out like a king.

Because tonight, he wasn‚Äôt just another IT guy.

Tonight, he was Kolkata‚Äôs unofficial Rain Summoner. A drunk. A legend. A martyr of summer.

And as he boards the auto from Sector V to Baguiati, he looks at the sky and says‚Äî

‚ÄúNext bar monsoon e joining nebo.‚Äù

The city wept.

Just like Sudeshna did‚Ä¶ when her cold coffee turned into room temperature betrayal.

**Summer in Kolkata isn‚Äôt a weather.**  
**It‚Äôs divine punishment for people who post ‚ÄúGood Vibes Only‚Äù during load-shedding!**

People come to cafees, restaurants etc to get coffee and start the day, noon, night.


People grab coffee on their way to work. But I don't get it.  It's not even a tasty drink - it's bitter. Plus too much caffeine is unhealthy. Is that a work problem? Like people working tiressly and needing coffee to live, then the effects wear off, they get even more tired and drink more coffee. 

Although my mom doesn't work, yet she drinks coffee all day. 
The only coffee I like to drink is frozen coffee (frappe, ice latte with caramel, cold coffee with a scoop of vanilla ice cream)

Also, coffee culture is basically normalizing addiction.

Either way, it's overrated, and as a regular coffee drinker, can you

My protagonist is sixteen years old and is in school. However, some of the themes I explore are quite mature, including war and survivor's guilt. (Beside my comps are mostly adult fiction) Do you think I'd better pitch it as YA Historical or just Historical Fiction? Does the story blurb read like YA to you?



I am pleased to submit for your consideration my 90,000-word historical fiction RED SOIL, featuring authentic Vietnamese history and legends. Intimate, insightful and immersive, RED SOIL explores the themes of love, identity and belonging in a wartorn Vietnam where survival is of utmost importance.¬†

Southern Vietnam, 1945. Sixteen years old An Le can speak four languages and thinks she‚Äôs destined for greatness. Until then, she has one simple goal: to survive at all costs. Scarred from her father‚Äôs arrest and the Japanese Forces‚Äô cruelty, she chooses to conform to the rules of her fascist school where her teachers and bullies have turned collaborators.¬†

Her quest for survival becomes further complicated when she falls in love with a seventeen years old Japanese lieutenant, who treats her like an equal. As An tries to reject his love, the shadow of her own past demons of internalised racism resurfaces, the result of her upbringing during the French colonial administration.

When her rebellious sister runs away to join the resistance force, An must decide what‚Äôs more important: her own self-preservation, or fighting with her sister at the risk of her own survival. An must use her language ability to survive the foreign powers on her homeland, and perhaps, survive the greatest hurdle of all: her guilt and shame over the shadows of her own choices, past, present and future.¬†

RED SOIL is Min Jin Lee‚Äôs Pachinko meets Yaa Gyasi‚Äôs Homegoing in wartime Vietnam. It will appeal to readers who want to immerse in Vietnamese culture and psyche beyond the Vietnam War, including Ocean Vuong‚Äôs On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Viet Thanh Nguyen‚Äôs The Sympathiser, and Nguyen Phan Que Mai‚Äôs Dust Child.¬†

I am Vietnamese - Australian who has been caught between two worlds, and like An, never fully belonged to either. I graduated from the University of \[Name\]. This novel was inspired by my Nan‚Äôs amazing storytelling of her experiences in Vietnam, started when I was sixteen and finished with the dedicated support of coffee during my night shifts at the hospital.

Thank you for your time and consideration,¬†

Is there anyway to fix this before its too late?,"My gf (f18) and me (m18) stopped having sex and i think it ruined our relationship. How can I fix it before its too late?

So me and my gf have been together for almost 3 years. In that timeframe we have only had sex 6 times with the last being late january 2024. In about half of them she has been the one to ask me so I know that at some point she did want that.

After that we continued to do other sexual acts not involving sex in which majority of cases I would be giving and barely receiving.Also throughout the time she has sent me multiple messages showing interest in having sex but when the time comes its just hands stuff and thats it. All this stuff stopped about 8 months ago.  She also stopped sending me any pictures and whenever I have asked its always that I seem to only care about her body. 

I have tried talking to her about this multiple times through the past year. Her first reason was that she only wanted to have it on my bed. I still live with my mom so its kind of tricky to find the right time for us to be alone but I agreed. After that she said that she wanted to keep her shirt on because she doesn't feel comfortable showing me even though I've already seen what needs to be seen. 

At first I said no about a month ago I couldn't control my urges anymore so I told her its fine for her to keep her shirt on. Now she told me that she feels its too soon. When I told her how could she feel that way if its been over a year and that she agreed to do it as long as I met her requirements which I did and she snapped back and said that its too soon and thats it. She continued berating me saying things again like im after her body and that I don't do anything nice for her which isn't true. 

Whenever I do get money I spend it on her almost all the time. I spent $100 of her birthday present, $70 on her anniversary present, and another $100 on her christmas present last year. She didn't give me anything on our anniversary and spent about $40 on my birthday and christmas present(they are a day apart). So I don't know how her claim of me not doing anything nice for her makes sense. Im always offering her food that I make and ordering her coffee. She thinks that as a man I should do things for her and that she doesn't have to do things for me if she doesn't want to.

After that I told her if she feels that im obsessed with her body (which why wouldn't someone be obsessed with their partners body?) than I won't ask her for anything to do with her body. 

Honestly since we stopped having anything sexual its made me feel really lonley because who else am I supposed to do this with. We werw both each others first times and now I am embarrased to feel anything like that with her.

After the most recent argument a month ago I haven't spent time with her besides dropping off things like money for her nails and hoodies, things like that despite her living only 4 minutes away in walking distance from me. 

The last two times I spent time with her was to help her build a bedframe in which I did almost all the work and help her paint a room. It made me feel like she just invited me to do her work for her.

This week I paid for her nails and all she said was a little thank you and then she asked me for another 20 dollars for coffee and stuff from the store and I told her no and I can tell that got her upset. I feel really underappreciated and feel more like a friend than a boyfriend to her at the moment. 

This weekend we are going out together so im hoping us spending time together could relight something in us and could bring us closer together.

Im scared that she has become an aesexual because then we won't be compatible anymore which is what I don't want I really do love this girl but I think sex is important in a relationship and especially of this length. I've given her all the time that shes needed and she refuses to give me a good answer and now I feel like our relationship is going to go downhill. Im going to wait another month before I bring up the topic again and

TDLR: My gf and I haven't had sex in over a year because she feels its too soon which caused a disagreement and now I feel she feels resentment because she thinks I only care about her body. I feel underappreciated for all that I do for her and she still expects more out of me and I feel like our relationship is going downhill.

**Reality:** The body, mind, and spirit are all included in the comprehensive practice of yoga. The *Patanjali Yoga Sutras* list eight limbs of yoga, of which the physical positions are only one. These eight limbs include meditation (*dhyana*), breath control (*pranayama*), personal observances (*niyamas*), ethical rules (*yamas*), and more. Yoga aims to achieve inner tranquility and spiritual emancipation in addition to physical fitness.

Myth 2: You Have to Be Flexible to Do Yoga

More than any other misconception, this one most often deters individuals from beginning yoga. Beginners may be intimidated by images of more experienced yogis in pretzel-like poses and believe they lack the flexibility to join.

The truth is that yoga helps you get more flexible, so you don't need to be flexible to begin. Being flexible is an outcome rather than a need. Since every body is unique, yoga may be modified to fit people of diverse ages, sizes, and skill levels. In actuality, those who are stiff or have limited mobility frequently gain the most. Yoga can meet you where you are with chair yoga, props, and modified practices.

Myth 3: Yoga is a Religion

Because yoga has roots in Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism, people frequently assume that doing yoga entails being a follower of a certain religion.

In actuality, yoga is a spiritual practice with philosophical foundations rather than a religion.  Though it has its roots in religious traditions, anyone can practice modern yoga without being religious.  Regardless of your beliefs‚Äîreligious, spiritual, agnostic, or atheist‚Äîyou can still do yoga.  It is not about worship or doctrine, but about self-awareness, mindfulness, and the connection of body, breath, and mind.

Myth 4: Yoga Is Only for Women

Yoga is frequently viewed as a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù activity, with women in leggings performing elegant poses, as a result of how it is portrayed in the media and in marketing.

In actuality, anyone may benefit from yoga.  In actuality, male sages and monks were the first people in ancient India to practice yoga.  The idea that yoga is exclusive for women is a relatively recent development, especially in Western societies.  As more men learn about the advantages of yoga for strength, concentration, and stress relief, they are taking back their place in yoga communities.  Age, gender, and physical shape are all irrelevant in yoga.

Myth 5: You Have to Follow a Certain Lifestyle to Practice Yoga

To be a ""true yogi,"" according to some, one must give up coffee, meditate for hours every day, or follow a vegetarian diet.

Reality: There is no one-size-fits-all yogic lifestyle, even if yoga promotes ethical living and mindfulness.  You can start without making a radical change to your life.  Making healthier or more mindful decisions may come naturally to you as your practice develops over time, but these decisions should be motivated by personal development rather than peer pressure or regulations.

Myth 6: Yoga is Easy or Boring

Some people believe yoga is too simple or uninteresting to be helpful since it places an emphasis on breathing and slower movement (particularly when contrasted with high-intensity workouts).

Reality: Although yoga can be calming and peaceful, it can also be psychologically and physically taxing.  There are numerous styles, ranging from the meditative and slow Yin Yoga to the vigorous Ashtanga or Power Yoga.  Lifting weights can be far easier than the focus, balance, and breath awareness needed for even the quietest yoga practice.  Yoga's ""ease"" is frequently found in its accessibility rather than its shallowness.

Myth 7: You Need Expensive Gear or Studio Memberships

Yoga can occasionally appear to be a costly lifestyle brand, from boutique studio lessons to luxury yoga trousers.

Reality: All you really need for yoga is your body and breath.  You actually only need comfortable clothing and a basic mat, or perhaps a towel.  Yoga is now more widely available than ever before because of community centers, books, and online courses.  The goal of authentic yoga is connection, not materialism.

Myth 8: Yoga Will Solve All Your Problems

Some wellness narratives portray yoga as a miracle remedy for a wide range of problems, including burnout, relationship problems, chronic pain, and anxiety.

The truth is that yoga can greatly aid in stress management, mindfulness training, and physical health enhancement.  It's hardly a panacea, though.  It's not a miracle, but a practice.  As with any tool, context, consistency, and aim determine how useful it is.  Yoga is most effective when combined with therapy, medical attention, rest, and social interaction in a comprehensive approach to wellness.

Why Busting Yoga Myths Matters

Just as crucial as knowing what yoga is is knowing what it isn't.  These falsehoods have the potential to reduce a rich spiritual tradition to a fitness trend, marginalize those who don't ""fit the mold,"" and generate unrealistic expectations.  By clearing up these myths, we create a yoga community that is more welcoming, genuine, and courteous.

Yoga has much to offer whether you're looking for spiritual inquiry, mental clarity, or physical energy.  However, it's about exhibiting inquiry, compassion, and presence rather than being flawless, adaptable, or enlightened.

Final Thoughts

Since its inception, yoga has undergone significant change and adaptation throughout centuries and countries.  It is our duty to interact with it in a considerate, kind, and sincere manner as it spreads over the world.  Let's avoid using myths to restrict yoga.  Rather, let us respect its richness, variety, and possibilities‚Äîfor each and every body and soul.[ READ MORE](https://aakash.nainitalinstituteoftechnology.com/)",1,1744272959.0,u_Mobile-Swordfish-813,0,1.0,False
1jvsrz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1jvsrz5/qcrit_historical_fiction_red_soil_90k_first/,[QCrit] Historical Fiction - RED SOIL (90k) - First Attempt,"Thank you for reading my story blurb! My protagonist is sixteen years old and is in school. However, some of the themes I explore are quite mature, including war and survivor's guilt. (Beside my comps are mostly adult fiction) Do you think I'd better pitch it as YA Historical or just Historical Fiction?

Dear \[Agent\],

\[Personalised message to agent\]

I am pleased to submit for your consideration my 90,000-word historical fiction RED SOIL, featuring authentic Vietnamese history and legends. Intimate, insightful and immersive, RED SOIL explores the themes of love, identity and belonging in a wartorn Vietnam where survival is of utmost importance.¬†

Southern Vietnam, 1945. Sixteen years old An Le can speak four languages and thinks she‚Äôs destined for greatness. Until then, she has one simple goal: to survive at all costs. Scarred from her father‚Äôs arrest and the Japanese Forces‚Äô cruelty, she chooses to conform to the rules of her fascist school where her teachers and bullies have turned collaborators.¬†

Her quest for survival becomes further complicated when she falls in love with a seventeen years old Japanese lieutenant, who treats her like an equal. As An tries to reject his love, the shadow of her own past demons of internalised racism resurfaces, the result of her upbringing during the French colonial administration.

When her rebellious sister runs away to join the resistance force, An must decide what‚Äôs more important: her own self-preservation, or fighting with her sister at the risk of her own survival. An must use her language ability to survive the foreign powers on her homeland, and perhaps, survive the greatest hurdle of all: her guilt and shame over the shadows of her own choices, past, present and future.¬†

RED SOIL is Min Jin Lee‚Äôs Pachinko meets Yaa Gyasi‚Äôs Homegoing in wartime Vietnam. It will appeal to readers who want to immerse in Vietnamese culture and psyche beyond the Vietnam War, including Ocean Vuong‚Äôs On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Viet Thanh Nguyen‚Äôs The Sympathiser, and Nguyen Phan Que Mai‚Äôs Dust Child.¬†

I am Vietnamese - Australian who has been caught between two worlds, and like An, never fully belonged to either. I graduated from the University of \[Name\]. This novel was inspired by my Nan‚Äôs amazing storytelling of her experiences in Vietnam, started when I was sixteen and finished with the dedicated support of coffee during my night shifts at the hospital.

Thank you for your time and consideration,¬†

I had coffee with my past/younger self today. We both planned to show up 15 minutes early and both frantically hurried into the coffee shop with 5 mins to spare(still early) I guess some anxieties never go away I told my younger self. We both sat down, both looked at each other, and both sighed for different reasons.

Younger self sniffled this continued every 3-8 minutes along with the routinely,""im gonna go blow my nose and use the bathroom ritual.""  I let younger me start, I asked my now self if we had gotten that promotion in coding, I smiled and said you dont know, the day before you were supposed to be told you made the descion to leave and follow tattooing full time, younger self looked at me, I smiled and said the money was there. By the time the buzzes and vibrations of his phone were going off, he went to check and quickly stopped. He looked annoyed and said she's at her parents. I wanted to smile but started to tear up, I told my younger self please never take her for granted. Please never get annoyed with her questions or curiosities of the world its why you fell in love with her. Younger self rolled his eyes, and went to go to the bathroom routinely again, and I said it won't help. That ""normal feeling""youre chasing isn't making the pain go away its just hiding the fact that its making youre life worse. He still kept walking, I said youre going to lose the one person who loves you more than anyone,  Younger self chuckled and asked if I wanted to join him, I smiled and chuckled under my breathe and got up, I told my younger self im still the same smart ass you know just sober.

Youngerself took off his coffin ring and scooped out and cut two lines with his card on his phone . He handed me the 2-3 inch cut straw a asked if I'd like to go first. Inside i felt a sadness I'd never felt before seeing myself like that.i told him no and without skipping a beat my youngerself snorted both lines. He asked why I came with him and I told him so I could remember what I looked like when I was ruining my life.

We sat back down at the table and younger me hit his vape, we talked about alot. He asked about my hand and arm tattoos, I had to re explain I tattooed fulltime now, younger me broke down crying, he said he didn't want to leave tech, I told my younger self its what helped save us. I made my youngerself promise to give rugrat and Littleton a hug and kiss and showed a picture of comet. I told my youngerself where I was at in our life mentally and emotionally and why. My youngerself couldn't believe it. I promised my youngerself we'd get through all of it and more. My youngerself looked down and played with his ring. I look at him and said things will get better. I told him about mom and dad's divorce and dad cheating I told him about mom's new boyfriend.  I joked about the heart tattoo on my shaft and my youngerself made me go to the bathroom with him to prove it and he wanted another line or two. By the end of our time visiting my youngerself asked if there was anything he could do to change anything, I told him no, and that's okay because even if there was some way, my younger self was too stubborn and angry at the world and himself to probably see that.
He asked about our medical health, and looked at me fearfully. I told him dad's memory is still okay nothing too noticeable just little things every few years. My younger self said I guess we never got better at just saying it did we, I shared my head and said no. I looked at him and said we lose things alot and forget alot, not like long term and not like short term and its random. It scares us even more now than it did before. We took a walk down the sidewalk, both cutting the other off mid sentence to start the next topic of endless nonsense conversations. Sometimes I forget how sneaky we were or thought we were,as younger me powdered his nose still routinely just now using a bullet(has nicknames like shooter,ect). He asked the hard questions to which I answered. Yes, Im sober now, Yes honest and Authentic fully(we dont have to lie to feel like people like us anymore)Then paused and asked if all this has happened why didn't we end it already, were we too pussy after all? I kinda chuckled and forgotten how arrogant and brutish my youngerself could be. No, I said we're not too pussy, I dont honestly know why, probably the worry that I wouldn't be able to get into heaven, maybe bc we think people will miss us or a bigger purpose, but I honestly dont know. I smiled once again at my younger self trying to lighten the mood, we are both at rough points in our lives, younger me just deserves a little bit more comfort than I do rn, I tell him everything will be alright have faith we always have. A few more hours of conversations and alot of take aways before
We hugged each other before our departure, we looked each other over one last long time and reached out and touched different pieces of jewlrey/clothing the other was wearing, things to look forward to I guess my youngself said as he sniffled.  You're alot tougher than you think sometimes I told my youngerself, I looked several items of clothing my youngerself had on and smiled, Memories you'll never forget and we both smiled said goodbye and walked away. (Both turning back on occasion to make sure the other wasnt sent to assassinate the other.)
