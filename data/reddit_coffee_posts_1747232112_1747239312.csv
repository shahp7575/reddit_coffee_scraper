First time posting this, I’m open to any feedback on this query letter, as well as suggestions for comps (not 100% set on Ottessa Moshfegh). I appreciate your time!

QUERY LETTER:

Dear \[Agent Name\],

Amid the heat and disillusionment of summer 1971, estranged brothers Joaquim and Fèlix Valentin set off across the deserts of the American Southwest in search of a burial site—for Fèlix. He’s still breathing, still very much alive. He just doesn’t believe it.

Since their mother’s suicide, Fèlix has slipped into near-catatonia, refusing food, water, and any evidence of his aliveness. The only thing that moves him is the promise of being laid to rest. Joaquim, his reluctant caretaker, proposed the road trip as a desperate gambit to reconnect, heal, and keep Fèlix from ending up like their mother—ashes. But he’s completely out of his depth, hiding his own grief and exhaustion behind brotherly bullying, gas station coffees, and a fraying veil of machismo.

Then Sunny Anderson hitches a ride. A recent college graduate, less bleeding-heart hippie than brazen opportunist, she sees in Fèlix a fascinating psychological case study—and her ticket to grad school. She and Joaquim form a wary alliance, their clashing approaches tempered by a slow-burning attraction. As the trio follow the crumbling vestiges of Route 66, they unearth the roots of Fèlix’s delusion: the high-minded ideals of exiled Catalan parents, the long shadow of Franco’s regime, illnesses physical and mental—and Joaquim’s flight from home at sixteen, an abandonment he won’t admit and Fèlix won’t forgive.

But the catalyst for the trip may not be as noble as Joaquim claims. Someone from his time in Vegas is following them—someone he owes. As Fèlix inches toward reconciliation—with Joaquim and life itself—and Sunny’s opportunism softens into affection, a fragile future comes into view. Before he can embrace it, though, Joaquim must reckon with the knowledge that some debts are too alive to bury. And for all the shit he gives his brother, he just might dig his own grave in the process.

Complete at 88,000 words, DEAR EXQUISITE CORPSE is an upmarket road novel with elements of psychological suspense. It blends the surreal, grief-soaked Southwestern landscape of Melissa Broder’s Death Valley with the dark, absurdist edge of Ottessa Moshfegh.

I am a California-based product designer with degrees in cognitive science and psychology, which inform my fiction’s focus on the mind, memory, and meaning-making. In addition to writing, I enjoy studying art history, playing piano, and taking on absurd personal challenges—this year’s is reverse St. Patrick’s Day: wearing green every day except the holiday. This would be my debut novel.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warmly,

\[name\]

  


FIRST 300:

Joaquim kicked up a flurry of rust-colored silt, then watched it settle like ash. His lips thinned into a scowl; his hands, slick with sweat, rested uneasily on the grip of a shovel. “So? You think this is the place?”

Fèlix considered the question, searching the desolate landscape of New Mexico for some vague quality Joaquim could never pinpoint. He then looked to the orange-hot sun setting over the hills, as if asking its approval. Nodded. “I think so.”

“You don’t sound very sure,” Joaquim muttered, checking the sole of his military surplus boots for a pebble that had been jostling around. He searched with such intensity that even Fèlix was captivated by this valiant Sisyphean struggle—only after a few failed attempts at dislodgement did Joaquim realize he’d acquired an audience. “So go on,” he said, gesturing with the hand not holding his shoe. “Have a lie down, see how it feels.”

Fèlix nodded and lowered himself until he was flat on his back, saying nothing of the dirt settling in the creases of his cheap brown leather jacket. He closed his eyes; inhaled. The colors of dusk scattered across tan skin and dark, troubled brows; the rest of his expression maintained its usual delicacy, shadows soft and features vaguely defined. The only pronounced edges were in his chapped lips, which were pale and scored with deep slits, the thickest in the center ornamented by a pearl of dried blood. Even that, in its perfect symmetry, seemed deliberate.

The pebble finally loosened, clattering to the dirt with a burst of dust. Satisfied, Joaquim returned his foot to the ground, digging his heel in for good measure. “What do you think?”

Brown eyes blinked open, as if forced from a dream. “This place is good. The soil’s soft.”

1kmj1rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1kmj1rl/relief_repost_to_help_those_looking_for_options/,Relief re-post to help those looking for options,"Here’s my relief post. I’m on 40 mg cymbalta now (also good for anxiety) and only 60 ER propranolol and less magnesium as well. 125 of Diamox. Hope it helps. If I did it under my circumstances, you can too! I don’t have debilitating light sensitivity anymore. I’m back to like 95% now. I also have reintroduced the foods I mentioned below and occasional alcohol and coffee every day again!

Finally feeling some relief!

Hi all, I’m back. After 18 months of non-stop, every day, intractable migraine, I’m finally feeling some relief! I had every symptom you can think of: shortness of breath, feeling like I’m falling, dizzy, vertigo, headache, light/sound sensitivity, tingling, numbness, brain fog, jello legs, intense fatigue, severe neck pain with attacks, anxiety, etc. This all sparked 3 months postpartum after my second child (subsequent to a miscarriage, where I actually experienced it to a lesser extent and blamed hormones for being super dizzy and unable to drive and it finally went away until it returned full force).

Want to share my journey to offer some hope and motivation to keep going.

I’m doing a multi-faceted approach to this that I’ll list-

Vitamins (all daily) CoQ10, B2, Magtein (3 pills daily), magnesium glycinate (4 pills daily), women’s one a day, probiotic -vitamin E 400 IU (3 days before my period and 3 days into me period. Helps!!)

Diet Not going crazy here because early on in my journey I excluded so much my brain had a really hard time processing anything back but some notable exclusions are still: Caffeine, alcohol, nuts, aged cheeses, almond milk, prunes (any dried fruit like this) and definitely no artificial sweeteners. I try to eat “healthy” for the most part.

Medications: -Propranolol 120ER (60 at night and 60 in the morning. I worked my way up to this dose -Diamox 250 mg in the morning and 125mg in the evening IF needed. Both doses are on a AS NEEDED basis. This helped me so much early on with the vestibular symptoms as I tried to find the right meds and treatment for me. It especially helps during my period! -Botox with my neuro. I have headaches with my VM so this helps me mostly with the headache portion -LAST but not LEAST- I didnt start feeling significant relief until Duluxotine! I’m starting on 20 mg. First night was rough (threw up and nauseas) and I recently switched my dose to the AM because it turns out it’s energizing, which is a surprising WIN! I have not had this relief in my journey yet. -was going to start vyepti but may even put that on hold now to see how cymbalta plays out.

Rescues: -ubrelvy, zavzpret and rizatriptan. Naratriptan for the week of my period. Naproxen as needed. I’m going to see how these play out because since starting duluxotine I haven’t needed these which is mind blowing. I needed rescues every day before.

Miscellaneous: -I use my avalux glasses for screens -I really try not to scroll too fast on my phone. This helps too and actually has made me more mindful of my screen time -melatonin 5mg at night helps

I tried the CGRPs and they weren’t for me but everyone’s journey is different. Just don’t feel bad if you can’t access those meds,turns out they weren’t the ones to help. I also cancelled my vestibular therapy as I want to do that at the very end when things stabilize even more.

I hope this post helps!",1,1747238836.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

No smoking or Vaping. I hate the smell of nicotine and the the smoke released from exhaling vapes. Also, I saw my Grandpa suffer in hospital and die as result of a lifetime of smoking.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.


Send me a message and lets get to know each other better.  

Also, it would be lovely if we could call each other, as I feel it's easier to build a stronger connection.

Do you have any idea how dangerous these dating apps are for women? I have been sexually assaulted TWICE by men that I met on dating apps — men who appeared to be normal, successtul people looking for a girlfriend, and yet were predatory sociopaths — so l'm somewhat cautious about who l meet IRL. Yet I'm still here, still optimistic that I could potentially meet somebody great. But I'm not immediately giving a stranger my freaking phone number. I hate having to block people, so I'd rather wait until l've met someone and know that we will date, or at least remain friends. The attitude and behavior of men on these platforms is batshit insane. They expect you to immediately share private information or “meet for coffee” before knowing anything about them, yet refuse to share any personal information themselves... barely answer the basic questions, won’t text, get crazy if you ask about their height or their job, want you to FaceTime with them first thing in the morning no make up.

The Kentron Space Government decided to create the Kentron Department of Defense and Safety (K.D.O.D.A.S) and for the safety of their people they decided to make bunkers that would seal shut from the inside and outside and they made sure that each and every one would be different and safer than others and they wanted to make sure that nothing can harm them, then Subject 527 (Name: Jack [REDACTED]) and Subject 232 (Name: Kenny [REDACTED]) decided to go to Genesis Bunker 72 where they are placed in cryopods where they will be frozen for “safety” and then they froze and stayed asleep for more than 200 years.

Chapter 2: After 258 years it has become 2633 and the systems began to malfunction for them and then they cough out water from their bodies and they then use the emergency release hatch from their cryopods and they walk out and find themselves the only ones awake and when they go to check everyone else’s vital signs all of them have been offline and there are none showing meaning that 23 people out of 25 that came have died peacefully while sleeping and then both Subject 527 and Subject 232 decided to get some weaponry and they see a coffee cup but something isn’t right, suddenly the coffee cup changes into a “mimic” and the mimic screeches and tried to latch onto Subject 232 but Subject 527 shoots it off and they both go out and they then override some system commands and they have read journals and some political documents and they found out that the K.D.O.D.A.S wasn’t using these bunkers for safety but rather to hide the truth that they were the ones causing a nuclear war and they have made these bunkers to make sure that no one will be aware on what has happened and they also made the bunkers to test on humans using radiation and in one bunker named Genesis Bunker 141 the K.D.O.D.A.S decided to open the bunker door where immense radiation went in and most people’s skins and muscles started to tear but they changed into Ghouls where they are deformed or look normal but have missing parts of their bodies and they are friendly to others and retain their memories and get a longer longevity, then they decide to override a command to open the bunker door and so that they can go up to land and after that they see mars as nothing but a desolate and lawless wasteland where buildings are now just rubble or dust, insects have grown its size by tenfold and there are now mimics in this place they once called home.

After some time they see some settlers and they wave to them for help but they got closer and closer and they realized it was the K.D.O.D.A.S and then a giant robot called X-73 with a screen stopped and said: “IDENTIFY YOURSELVES IMMEDIATELY. FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN POSSIBLE TERMINATION” and they try to identify themselves using their subject names but then X-73 says: “ERROR: NO SUBJECTS FOUND, HOSTILES REGISTERED AND DETECTED” and then Subject 232 tries to shoot it but then X-73 grabs his right arm and he breaks it by bending it the other way and rips it off and Subject 232 screams in pain and Subject 527 tries to shock it but X-73 knocks them out and the last things they hear are: “HOSTILES KNOCKED OUT, SENDING OUT A M-72 MEDI-VAN” before they shut their eyes.

Chapter 3: After some time they both wake up to find themselves in a settlement and a Ghoul with no nose said: “Welcome to the Varzi Settlement! Where we all live in harmony and we fight for freedom and justice, what are your names?” And Subject 232 and 527 both hesitate because they never used their names in so long so they say their subject names and the Ghoul says his name his Robert Jones and he’s heard of the K.D.O.D.A.S, they are nothing but liars and terrorists who wants to profit out of the news and then make policy and grow an army and a new group called the K.D.O.M.A.D (Kentron Department of Military and Defense) and they wanted to make it so that they could take control of mars and possibly kill all ghouls due to them being “hostile” and “grotesque and dangerous” to society but all they wanted is to remove the innocent and recruit those who are greedy, then Robert sees Subject 232’s arm and he asks him what happened to which 232 says: “An X-73 broke my arm by bending it in half and ripped it off of me but I just want to know if you could help me?” To which Robert replies: “I can help, follow me to the medical center” and they walk towards the medical center and then when they reach there Robert says: “Place your arm on the machine.” And 232 does and they make a robotic prosthetic arm where it’s a near 1:1 replica of the original arm and with a few adjustments and upgrades he can use it with ease and Robert says: “If you need anything we are always here to help you two, alright?” They both nod and they decided to look around the Settlement and they see most of the settlers are ghouls and one of them decided to show subject 527 a photo of his grandchild and said that he wished to see him one last time before the nuclear war, suddenly subject 232 decided to try and find Robert and he sees Robert with another ghoul but he was wearing an armband with the same Varzi Settlement symbol except there was words that say: “To Freedom and Glory!” And then both subjects go up to him to which Robert sighs and says: “I think it’s time to let you two know some operations.” And 232 replies: “What operations?” And Robert answers by saying: “Operations against the K.D.O.D.A.S and the K.D.O.M.A.D to stop them from taking all of mars and use it for profits and for their expanding military” and then Robert shows them a hologram which showed that almost 75% of mars was taken by the K.D.O.D.A.S and most of it was used to enslave ghouls to exploit them for profits and to get rare resources to then use them for new military equipment and for new bases and for “Projects” like: Project Irma and Project Nuvee so that they can build prisons where they would place all Ghouls or Brutes so that they would be forced to work for the K.D.O.D.A.S and if they fail then they’ll be executed on the spot with no hesitation, that made Subject 232 and Subject 527 horrified by what the Kentron Government was doing and Robert then asks his colleague, who’s name is Kendel Pierre, about what they have found and Kendel replies with: “We have found numerous weak points in a new base they’re trying to build for the past 7 years and they have managed to complete 90% of it, what we can do is try to kill the guards that are surrounding the place and we can then get to the control room where we could then release the hatch from the huge steel alloy cylinder and that can then destroy the building if it hits a certain point and after that we all have to make a quick escape and go back to the settlement.” And Subject 232 asks: “How are we going to get through them? They have heavy fire power and we got nothing!” To which Kendel says: “We can try to enter Bunker 183, my Intel says that there are crates of weaponry that we can use so that we can get through the guards and their defenses and we can get some Armor in Bunker 58, which is 5 kilometers away from Bunker 183 so we don’t get immediately gunned down and turn into sludge.” And Subject 232 and 527 look at each other and then they agree to the mission and they want to make sure that the people of Varzi would be safe, so they will also try to get food and drinks and anything necessary for the settlement, and off they go.. finding supplies for them and their own people.

Chapter 4: While they were walking the journey to Bunker 183 they saw mutilated insects running away from something and they turn to find a brute and they try to run but the brute slams its fists on the ground causing a minor yet powerful shockwave that sends them flying at least three feet away from it and subject 232 decided to try and shoot it down and his suit detected its vital signs and 232 shot it twenty one times before the vital signs were showing: “NO SIGNS AVAILABLE”, and so they continue their journey to Bunker 183 where they saw more X-73’s, a new robot prototype called the Y-82 and they have also recruited multiple enslaved and imprisoned ghouls to their settlement and rebel group and after 3 hours of walking, shooting and sneaking they manage to find Bunker 183 and they open the door and enter inside and they go down the elevator but when the doors open they were horrified on what they saw. Multiple Skeletons that when scanned showed immense radiation, bodies that were destroyed by radiation and one of them was frozen as he tried to push the button to initiate an emergency shutdown to the door and they decided to walk around the bunker where they found body bags, crates with radioactive materials until they finally find the weaponry crates where they see there are a lot of weapon variety and they realized something, they had enough to give it to the Varzi Settlement to fight against the K.D.O.D.A.S and to make sure the people protect themselves, after a few minutes of searching for more supplies they found some drugs which can be used for medical purposes once concentrated such as a rare drug called: ‘Penzivlim’ which is a highly potent drug that shows resistance against diseases, cancer and even minor radiation poisoning, they were happy and they decided that they were done here and they carried the crates outside the bunker and Robert called for a Unit 73-2 to pick up the crates back to base and the group then left and took another 2 hours due to them encountering Brutes and a Super Brute and then afterwards they make it to Bunker 58 where they find the bunker door already opened and inside it was quiet… too quiet… and Subject 527 says: “Alright! Turn on night vision mode, we don’t know what’s going to come out, if you see it and it doesn’t look right then shoot it.” And they all turn it on and they move around the bunker, exploring the place, when out of nowhere something moves, Subject 232 decides to pursuit it and he yells: “Don’t Move!” And the thing turns around and…

it was just an unarmed ghoul who thought he was in danger.

Subject 232 then says with a bit of guilt: “Sorry! I thought you were a radiated cockroach.” 

Then subject 232 gets a radio signal from Robert saying: “232, we found the crates! Pinging the location right now.” And 232 sees it in his mini map and he cautiously runs towards it and when he reaches there he finds the group already placing armor into their suits and Subject 527 says: “Alright, now it’s your turn to put on some protection, don’t want you to die so soon.” And 232 looks at the armor and he grabs it and starts to wear it, it’s lightweight yet durable, then they decide to check for more and after 38 minutes they find 4 crates, half of it is food and water supplies and the other are just ammunition for different types of weapons, then as they were leaving they suddenly heard a sound of a jet engine and they immediately take cover and they see a massive M-47 “Iron Eagle” landing on the entrance of Bunker 58 and the door opens as soldiers of the K.D.O.D.A.S and K.D.O.M.A.D immediately surround the area and their leader, named: ‘Martian Niviri’, marched to the door as he said to his troops: “Search the perimeter now! Make sure that if you see anyone or anything shoot on sight, any traces leading to the ghouls must be handed to me for testing and for identification” and as he walks into Bunker 58 along with his troops the group decides to escape by first moving away in stealth and then after they’re in a zone where no one will hear them, they will make a run for it and they tried to enter their settlement and they finally did after 6 hours later and the group returns back to the place of operations where Robert shows a holograph of the Bunkers that has been looted and they show how much weaponry they have gotten and they got:

Heavy Weaponry: 34,829
Medium/Assault Weaponry: 44,729
Light Weaponry: 29,739
Food and Water Supplies: 392,738
Medical and Drug Supplies: 472,881

And they have done it in just one day, they wanted to try to make their people live safe from the dangers of the Kentron Government and happy about them being free from restrictions of the government. Then after some days pass they decide to make new places for medical needs, food, shelter, weaponry and for learning and they made it all possible for the settlement, the children of ghouls learnt many things, the health of the people from the settlements have increased drastically, the hunger and homelessness from the settlement has dropped significantly and the people were now safer with weaponry on their hands just in case of the K.D.O.D.A.S or the Kentron Space Government maybe one day try to take control of the settlement. Robert then asks Subject 232 and 527 if they’re ready on the next mission to destroy the ‘Projects’ from the Kentron Space Government and to stop the making of prisons and slave farms, they’re doing this for freedom and justice.

Chapter 5: After eight months of preparation for the operation they have completed their training and they have located all weak points and key areas where guards will be and where the emergency alarms will start, they had to be sneaky because one wrong move and the alarm blares, next thing they know they will see a rain of bullets hit them all over their body, so they have to be careful and then after equipping their body armor and get their weapons they were ready to attack the nearly built project, and so their journey began, they walked at-least 37 kilometers away from the settlement, they have encountered an iron bird flying and killing six ghouls by its powerful and fast machine gun, had to make sure that they didn’t wake the brutes from their sleep in order for them to move safely and they had to shoot some K.D.O.M.A.D troops in order for them to progress further in their journey, finally after hours of walking they find the building and its massive, standing tall in a height of 500 feet tall, they had to be ready for risks that could happen on the way, and so they began, they first took down three guards from the entrance, climb up to the 3rd floor where they had to kill another set of guards, walk up the planks to the 18th floor and then while they were going up to the 19th floor Subject 232 heard a crack from the wooden plank and he immediately tried to escape quickly but then the plank broke and he tried to hang onto the plank but it broke and Robert and 527 went up to him and helped him up quickly and then they hear the dreaded sounds of the alarms, Robert then says with annoyance: “Oh great, well guess we have to do this the old fashioned way: Noise.” And they immediately start heading up, meanwhile Kendel back at base, was talking to them via Bezir Comms and he told them where to go and told them how many guards are going to be there, after some hours they finally managed to get to the 83rd floor where they saw a control pannel and Robert puts in an sd card and asks Kendel if he help and Kendel immediately checks for files and for a way to breach through the defenses and security systems, until finally he breaches through and Robert then does an override command to drop the steel alloy cylinder and then the magnet is turned off and the cylinder drops with great speed and force and then it starts breaking the lower floors, times running out fast.. suddenly they see Martin Niviri and Robert and 232 chase him down and when they were close to him Robert tackles him to the ground and Martin says: “I surrender! Please don’t hurt me! I’ll do anything!” And as 232 lowers his guard Martin suddenly pulls out a switch and says: “But if we die, then I’ll make it quick!” And then he pushes the button and the entire building explodes and 232 was knocked back by the force and 527 was unconscious and… 

there was silence…

Until they hear radio chatter and 4 ghouls taking 527 and 232 in a medi-van and 232’s vision was blurry but he saw Kendel running up to Robert yelling: “ROB! PLEASE WAKE UP! SOMEONE GET A MEDIC!” And then 232 passes out.

Next day 232 and 527 wake up and they find themselves unharmed and they look around and Kendel enters and asks them: “Hey, just wanted to check up on the both of you to make sure your alright” then 232 looks around and asks where is Robert, to which Kendel responds: “He’s recovering, he’s not dead luckily, he’s going to come back but we need to give him two months to recover completely, doctors say that his left eye is damaged severely, his right arm was blown off and his legs were nearly burnt, he’s gonna be alright but we have to let time decide wether he lives or not” and then 527 thinks for a second and asks: “Wait.. what about Martin? Did he die?” And Kendel responds with: “No, that was just a hologram, we were deceived that easily.” And then 232 leaves his hospital bed and he searches for Robert and when he sees him he runs up to him and Robert opens his eyes, he is now very weak, and then Robert speaks saying: “Martin… is.. a traitor.. show this.. to our people… for glory..” before he goes back to sleep. Then 232 gets up and he starts to cry as his colleague and mentor and even a possible best friend is going to possibly die sooner or later all because of Martian Niviri.. 232 then he throws a pot in a fit of rage, he wants to kill Martian, take Martin down to the grave and burn him alive.. but Kendel stops him saying: “There is no point in this frustration and anger, the more anger you have against them, the more aggressive you will resemble like them, nothing but angry swines who want nothing but bloodshed, I promise you after he recovers we will find a way to kill Martian Niviri.. for Glory.” 232 nods and he goes back to his hospital bed where he sleeps and rests for another day.

Once it ended, I happened to walk out of the lecture room around the same time as this other girl. She was a few steps ahead of me.

By coincidence, we both end up walking out the same door. I was omw to get coffee and then to get some to eat. I noticed I was behind the same person for a few mins but obviously didn't think anything of it, it wasn't anything uncommon... yet. Pretty sure she looked back toward me at least once at this point though, so she would have been aware of me as well.

We both walked towards the coffee shop, and then ig we both had decided to get something from there, ofc. I entered the line behind her, and I see her look over her shoulder again, and my anxiety spikes a bit. You know that feeling when you think someone in front of you might think ur following them, and you dont wanna look like a creep? I doubted she thought that but I decided to make sure we split ways after tims by just lingering for an extra few seconds.

She actually just ended up getting some cookie or donut, so I didn't even need to do all that. She's gone by the time I finish ordering, and by the time I picked up my coffee I forgot abt her.

And then I start walking toward the exit and she just APPEARS from the left from behind the circular room, coming from the washrooms. She def saw me, I was easily visible to her right, and to nobodys surprise she turns left and walks toward the same fucking exit I'm walking towards. I just keep walking cause its not like i was actually following her, but I'm praying we split paths soon.

This continues all the way to the station. I was concerned at this point cause like I prolly looked hella sus after everything, so I slowed my pace down so she could get ahead. Regardless, to my utter fucking dismay, she walks toward plaza, same as me, and I just end up following her but from further behind. I didn't want to just deviate my entire route cause like I thought that would be a bit too excessive since she might not have even noticed (she definitely did).

I got to the dorm like 20 seconds after she did so thankfully we lost sight of eachother after she walked around the corner, and I walked the rest of the way to the dorms without seeing her.

Anyways if you see this, I was not following you lol, thats my bad.

Coupled with lifelong PCOS and my ferritin level hitting 31 (wooo iron deficiency), I've had difficulty keeping up with the house for the past several weeks. And it's driving me fucking bonkers being too drained to take care of everything piling up. 

Plus, my fiancé is at work most days, I work remotely, and we don't have kids, so the piles I'm behind on are mostly my own from lack of energy. (i.e. The unopened mail I've just been throwing on the coffee table.) Which pisses me off even worse from internalized shame.

Yet if I try to put on a good hip-hop album and get into action, it's like a vampire stole my life force. The simplest tasks feel impossible to carry out. Probably because I haven't been processing food or nutrients properly! What a shocker!

It's the physical drain affecting my brain and body, man. I've been able to churn out nicely-organized data projects at work after I started taking iron and B12 -- but outside of the screen, my muscles are like ""Oh honey, the physical act of sorting those envelopes and throwing out the junk would simply be way too much!""

Anyhow, how were your energy levels before the surgery, and how were they afterward?

I'm especially interested in hearing from people who felt drained of all life, yet somehow felt human and able to complete a full day of _basic-ass chores_ afterward.

How long did it take for your energy levels to return? Did they return?

I am past the ""extreme"" beginner phase of cooking, but I do not cook often since I cook at home. (To make up for this I buy groceries as needed.)

My question to you all is what is NOT worth making from scratch?

For me, bread seems to be way too much work for it to cost only $2ish. I tried making jelly one time, and I would not do that again unless I had fruit that were going to go bad soon.

For the price, I did make coffee syrup, and it seem to be worth it ($5 container, vs less than 20 mins of cooking and less than a dollar of ingredients)

1kmiuv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kmiuv4/navigating_pain_management_and_self_advocacy/,Navigating pain management and self advocacy,"Hello everyone, 

I've been admitted to hospital for the last 3 days because of recurring severe abdominal pain that I have not been able to manage at home. After 4 ER visits to get subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone, I was admitted and given an IV. 

The pain is caused by gallbladder sludge and a possible stone (that may have left the gallbladder already and hasn't been seen on any ultrasound or CT scan) that have blocked bile ducts. Day 2 in the hospital my bilirubin #s jumped up and I'm yellow in the eyes.

The current plan is to manage pain until the sludge/stones pass either on their own or at my ERCP appointment a week from today, whichever comes first. 

Then the gallbladder is getting removed. If something changes and I get worse, I believe I might have the gallbladder removed right away. 

I have been taking ozempic for weight loss for 5 months, and the doctors do not believe it's the cause, and have not advised me to stop. I'm due for a dose today and not sure I'll be Able to do it.

Because ozempic slows down absorption, the oral ketorolac and hydromorph I was prescribed from the ER have not been effective in managing the pain at home, as I would be in agonizing pain for hours before giving in and going to hospital for subcutaneous hydromorph for relief. 

Since being here, I've had to request each new nurse administer via IV as my pain ""attacks"" go from 0 to an 8 or 9 within 30 minutes, so the oral route isn't effective. I.e. I can just be in pain at home.

My current nurse is strongly against the use of ozempic for weight loss.  I get it.

She wants to transition me from receiving pain meds IV to oral. So this morning when I felt it coming on, she gave me the hydromorph pill and said if it works I can go home because I'm getting better (based on how I look).

Sounds great, but I've now been sitting here for an hour with the pain building. She said it would kick in within 30 minutes, and seems to disagree that ozempic can slow or interfer with the absorption of pain meds taken orally. That or further evidence I shouldn't be using this medication, I'm not sure the point of this.

I want to go home more than anything right now, but the last week of being in excruciating pain and waiting for hours in emergency just to be sent home after getting the pain relief and repeating the cycle....I don't want to go thru that again.

Being in pain sucks, and even with the IV meds, it can take 30 minutes to an hour for the nurse to be free to administer (like every hospital it's very busy here).

I know I'm taking up a bed, I know it's more work for the nurse to administer by IV. But I have a hard time speaking up for myself and this very lovely and knowledgeable but very opinionated nurse has a ""my way or the highway"" mentality and now I feel like I'm just going to sit here in pain until it's been long enough for me to ask for IV ketorolac.

This nurse even argued with my Dr about how much laxative to give me (haven't gone in 3 days). 

I actually really like her but I am feeling like I can no longer ask for what I need. 

I don't even know what I'm asking. I need the right language to use to advocate for myself without triggering my nurse's tendency to call me out for taking the easy way out.yes ozempic is kind of the easy way out, I get it.

Also, I'm on a clear fluids diet and she doesn't allow me to drink any juice or sugary things as she says it's not good for my gallbladder. For breakfast I have apple juice, orange juice, lime jello, and coffee. Coffee upsets my stomach so I'm not drinking any of it. 

My friend is a nursing student and she's on this floor today, so I'm hoping she can help advocate for me.

Alexia wore a green slip dress that came to her knees with simple black open toed heels. She could hear the excitement of the pack house in her room. Luca came in with a “Hey sis” in way of greeting. He looked her over and said with a smile on his face “My knuckles are going to get real bloody keeping all those male wolves away tonight but you look good.”

“Thanks Luca, you don’t look too bad yourself."" His blonde hair styled perfectly. He had the same blue eyes as her. There was no denying they were siblings. ""Have you snuck a peak downstairs yet?” She asked.

“And risk mom’s wrath? Not a chance.” He replied looking in the mirror while fixing his cuff links on the sleeves of his navy blue suit. “I have though, been checking the group chat and squad seems to think it’s the party of the year.”

“Mom will be so pleased.” Alexia laughed picturing Shelia standing proud.

“I don’t have my phone! Tell me what’s going on!” Alexia pressed.

“Ok! Ok! Hang on. Alpha Eugene’s beta is already drunk. Great. Thomas and Chris are making bets to see which warrior tries to stick their tongue to the ice sculpture. Mom will be thrilled. Ohh and Edmond just walked in and yep all the she wolves are throwing themselves at him per usual.”

Alexia rolled her eyes. ""Tell them put me down for 50 on dad's warrior Tony."" She recalled the time Tony ran around the practice field in heels and dress singing barbie girl for a bet. The man had no shame.

Just then their parents appeared at the door. “Ok my babies it’s about time! Oh! I can’t believe this day is here. Happy Birthday my angels!” Their mom said while hugging them. She fixed Luca's tie and a stray hair of Alexia's then stepped back next to their father

“No father could ask for better children, I am proud of the people you both have come.” The father said as he shook Luca’s hand and kissed Alexia on the cheek. Shelia stood next to her husband nodding in agreement.

Out of the corner of her eye Alexia saw Luca fighting back tears. She smiled. Both of them always wanted to make their father proud, Ecspecially Luca since he will take over the alpha position.

""All right we better get this show on the road, We will go down and then introduce you two so you can make your entrance."" Their mother said as she made her way to the door. She blew them a kiss as she and their father disappeared.

After their parents went back downstairs, Luca and Alexia moved to the staircase to await their discent. She shifted her weight from each foot. ""

“Here we go, head high and shoulders back” Luca said as they heard their names announced and they descended the staircase into the waiting party below.

Luca and Alexia made their way over to their group after being stopped by many well-wishers. Alpha Jacob welcomed everyone and the band began to play. By the time they made it to the squad most of the guests were on the dance or talking amongst the selves.

“Happy Birthday!” the squad sang together.

“Thank you, Thank you” the twins smiled and said.

Alexia’s eyes caught Edmond’s. Nothing. No spark. Not her mate. She could have sworn she saw a hint of sadness in them. But then he smiled grabbing a bottle of champagne and glasses and said “A toast to the birthday boy and girl! Finally the youngest of us is finally legal!” Causing the group to all cheer.

Alpha Jacob cut in then, ""Edmund"" He said sticking his hand out for the prince to shake ""It's been a while, how is the family?""

""Edmund shook his hand with a smile. ""They're great, mom and Caspain send they're regards but are sorry they cannot make it.""

""Oh I'm sure Caspian is surrounded by work to do in the Kingdom."" Jacob said, not at all hurt by their lack of attendance. Bidding a farwell to the group and a reminder to make wise choices, he went to go mingle with the other guests.

""I will claim the first dance with the birthday girl"" Edmund declared. ""I better watch my back now or your fans my try to shank me"" Alexia said with smile on her face. They all laughed and began to dance. When it was time to cut the cake both siblings were tempted to push the other’s face into it but the look their mother was giving them made them think better.

By the end of the night the squad ended up by a lake near the pack house with bottles of champagne and food they had swiped before coming outside. The boys ties were undone and the girls shoes long abandoned. The sky was turning light blue as dawn approached.

They told jokes and stories, laughing the entire time. It was Chris who said “So, neither of you found you’re mates?” Hazel elbowed him ""You Idiot"" Hazel said through gritted teeth. ""I know you're right but why?"" he said shocked and confused.

“No” Luca replied with a look of wondering in his eyes.

“Well, that means we're still on for the annual squad weekend at the palace next week.” Chris said confidently.

Edmond laughed “Mom looks forward to the squad coming to visit since she likes having the house full, especially since dad died.”

“Well Judy does make the best cookies” Thomas went on and began to list all his favorite foods to eat at the palace.

""I don't think she appreciated it when you boys got drunk and slid down the staircase in laundry baskets knocking over a priceless vase."" Alexia said eyeing the boys.

""No she did not"" Thomas responded, grimacing at the memory. ""She made us run laps around the palace till we puked and then made us clean up our puke. T'was not a good day""

They’ve always hung out at the palace a lot since it was harder for Edmund to get away. It was also a mid way point between all their packs. ""How are royal duties?"" Alexia asked Edmund. ""Boring. Absolutely Boring. But it helps Caspian and he is always busy. So I will solve problems between busy body she wolves and cry baby alphas."" He responded.

“Don’t forget that August 1st we start Leadership training and were all going to be at the palace for three months!” Tabatha said.

“You know all the other young alphas and Lunas are going to hate us right?” Luca said. ""They will go out of their way to try and knock us down.""

“Oh, Most definitely” Christopher replied. The Squad was the strongest of the future Alphas and Lunas which caused the others their age to be very jealous.

“They hate us cause they ain’t us!” Thomas chimed in.

""Grant is going to be there."" Hazel said causing a groan to sweep across the group. Her cousin was arrogant and only caredabout how he looked. He also was not fond of the group and made it his mission to get under their skin.

""Forget them, we stay together and have each other's back."" Luca said as the rest of the group agreed.

Alexia sat in the grass contemplating the upcoming months “How many others will be there?” Alexia asked.

It was Edmund who responded with “At least 100.”

Jeez, Alexia thought, that is a lot of alpha blood in one place.

“Someone is going to get into a fight.” Alexia said

Edmund said in a calm voice “It is not a question of if as to when.”

# Interogation

Alexia groaned as she awoke. She should not have drank so much. Her head felt slightly fuzzy.

Rolling over to check her phone, the bright light caused her squint as if she was starring straight into the sun. The group chat seemed to be in agreement with Thomas swearing off alcohol. Again. That will be the day. Luckily, their werewolf blood should burn through the booze fairly quickly.

After a shower and some much needed coffee Alexia headed out to the training field, Her body already recovered from the previous night's activities. She spotted her dad immediately. His powerful alpha aura acting like a beacon as he watched the warriors train. He would cause others to step back from his because aura was so powerful but to her it was as easy as walking up to a puppy.

She walked up to him “ Good Morning Daddy” she said with a smile.

He turned to her smiling “ Well good morning, I didn’t think I would see you till tomorrow based on how many empty bottles of Champagne the cleaning crew found by the lake this morning.”

She laughed sheepishly “I was hoping to get a light workout in this morning.”

“Well good, if you need any help me know.” He said heading to meet the warriors who finished their first set of training. He added over his shoulder “Love you.”

“Love you too” She said heading towards the trails.

On her way to the trails she spotted Luca. “Going for a jog?” he asked as she came near.

“Yeah, wanna join?” she replied.

“My body says no but my head says I need to so I guess I will” he said with a shrug.

The twins had always trained together since they could walk. Their father knew their was something special about them and he was proven right during their first shift. They were both white wolves. The strongest and most rare wolves. Their great great great grandfather had been a white wolf, an elite warrior. A legend. He had fought in the vampire wars and ultimately helped bring peace to the kingdom. There had not been another white wolf seen since his passing, until the twins. Even then their identity was kept secret. Very few people knew about the twins fur in order to keep them safe.

Their fur made them a target and their father would not risk their safety which is why he worked them so hard. Luca was tall with broad shoulders with his blonde hair and blue eyes he stole the hearts of all the she wolves in the pack. He looked strong and was strong with the cool demeanor to match.

Alexia on the other hand was five feet two inches on a good day. She was petite but had matching blonde hair and blue eyes to Luca. A gift they inherited from their mother. She didn’t look it but was as fierce as any of her father’s warriors.

As they ran, Alexia became lost in her thoughts. Who was her mate? Neither her or her brother had found their mate. Granted they were probably children of alphas from another pack so that’s why they hadn’t found them. The uncertainty made her anxious, unable to focus thinking about different possibilities.

It was until Luca mind linked that she awoke from her thoughts “Do you smell that?” He asked.

She sniffed the air, a pungent smell hitting her nose. “Rogues” she stayed.

They immediately mind linked their father and went into stealth mode. The crept over a hill, hiding behind boulders keeping low to the ground. They observed 20 rogues working as of they were looking for something.

""Anything?"" one of the rogues asked. ""No not a thing"" another responded.

They reported back to their father awaiting his arrival.

“Neither of you fight” he ordered the twins.

“But-“ Luca started to say but was cut off.

“No buts, I don’t want the two of you discovered, at least not yet.” He said. The twins laid low in silent protest, silently observing.

Soon their father arrived and tore through the rogues. The rogues were so surprised most were killed before they knew what hit them. The twins watched the slaughter. When it was over the ran back to the pack house to change and meet their father in the dungeons. He always kept at least one rogue alive to interrogate.

The twins made their way down the stairs of the dungeon where a rogue was being brought in. They tied him to a chair.

“Who are you?” Their father said. No response. “What we’re you doing on my land?” Still no response. The twins leaned against the wall with bored expressions as the interrogation went on for hours. Luca starred at the wall absolutely bored with the lack progress they were making.

“I’m losing my patience and when that happens it will become very painful” alpha Jacob said circling the rogue with a knife in hand.

Alexia observed the rogue. He was caked in dirt and grim. His hair was matted from living in the wilderness and in desperate need of a shower. The was not a finger that she could see that did not have dirty under the nail.

“I will never tell you anything!” The rogue yelled.

“Who do you work for?” The alpha yelled back.

Alexia thought to herself, that they had asked the same question a hundred times already.

Just then the door opened with a warrior bringing in an asortment of tools. Her father selected plyers and started removing the rogue's dirty nails from their beds. Screams sounded throughout the room. Alpha Jacob continued to ask his question and without an answer, another nail was taken.

“You all will be destroyed! Every last one of you will be slaughtered like the pigs you are!” The rogue shouted. Before anyone could react he thrust his chair so quick and so hard he snapped his own neck.

The room was silent. The twins looked to their father.

“I want patrols on alert and ready, this rogue may be crazy but I want us ready just in case.” Alpha Jacob said nodding and then exiting the twins left to carry out the order.

# Squad on the Town

Finally Squad Weekend rolled around and it was time for Alexia and Luca to meet up with their friends. They put their belongings in the backseat of Luca's truck and began the journey to the palace. It was a beautiful day with clear skies. After turning on the radio alexia rolled the window down, letting the air hit her face secretly hoping to catch the scent of her mate. They arrived at the palace first and went to meet up with Edmund after dropping their bags in their respective rooms.

Looking up from his desk, Edmund noticed their approach. ""Is it time already?"" he asked.

""No worries the others aren't here yet."" Luca responded.

*Ding!* Their phones chimned.

""It's the group Text"" Alexia said looking at her phone.""They are pulling into the gates"" She added.

""Well this is as good of a stopping place as any, Let's go meet them outside."" Edmund said while rising from his desk andputting the papers he had been working on away.

The three of them walked out of the palace doors as the other four rolled up.

“What up squad?” Chris said to them with a grin as he and Thomas grabbed theirs and their mates' luggage out Chris's Jeep.

“It’s one weekend, why do y’all have so much luggage?” Edmund asked looking skeptically at the jeep.

“Hey, Chris and I each brought a backpack. Hazel and Tab on the other hand are packing for the apocalypse.” Thomas retorted giving an exasperated look and holding his hands up.

“And you always forget something!” Tabatha said defending herself.

“Let’s get the love birds settled in before this weekend turns into couple counseling and I think none of us want that” Alexia said uneasliy then turning to walk into the palace.

Since Alexia and Luca arrived before the rest of the group they headed to the den to wait with Edmund.

""How are you?"" Alexia asked looking at Edmund.

Sighing he made his way across the room to pour himself a drink before speaking ""I've been better. Mom went to visit her sister and Caspian is off being king so I have been left to take care of the castle."" The twins gave him a sympathetic look. ""Well, we're here to help you blow off some steam."" Luca said. ""I appreciate that"" Edmund said. ""It is much needed.""

After having finished unpacking, the mated couples walked into the room. “Does it seem more quiet than usual to you guys?” Thomas said walking into the den with his mate and the others behind him. “It’s because my brother isn’t here. Rogues have been increasing along the border so most of the royal guard went with him to patrol to acess the situation.” Edmund said.

“Ah” Thomas said fitting the pieces together then walked over to the bar to pour himself a drink.

""We had rogues hit us last week. Dad is not very concerned but still taking precautions."" Luca said.

""Good"" Edmund said. "" We've been monitering their activity. They haven't done anything to be alarmed at but we still want to be ready."" The men nodded in agreement.

“Let’s do something!” Hazel exclaimed. “I’ve been cooped up in the car and I need to burn some energy!” She said.

“Isn’t that Chris’s job” Luca said giving her a knowing look causing the group to laugh. “Get your mind out of the gutter!” Hazel said with her face growing red. “Well he isn’t wrong” her mate said causing her to smack his arm.

“Ok! Here is the plan.” Luca said taking charge. “Everybody go change and get dressed, we are going out tonight!”

“Out?” questioned Alexia looking at her brother.

“We’re all alpha’s kids we don’t get to go out?” Tabatha said from the couch.

""Well, tonight we’re going to be reckless teenagers and eat, drink, and dance. Any objections?” Luca asked looking around the room at their faces.

“No” they said in unison smiles spreading across faces.

“All right then, Squad rolls out in 20.” Luca stated clapping his hands.

In twenty minutes they were changed and pulling out of the palace drive in Edmund’s escalade. The girls wore tight mini dresses and the men button downs with slacks. They stopped at a restaurant to begin their journey. Each taking time to tell the others what they had been up to since the last time they saw each other.

After they had eaten they piled back into the cramped escalade and found a popular club to go dancing at. As they walked up the door the bouncer barely had to take a glance at the group before ushering them into the VIP section. One alpha was good for a business's media buzz but a whole group and a prince? The owners would be beside themselves with glee.

The music was hypnotizing, beckoning the group to the dance floor. Alexia danced rotating between Edmund and Luca. She took a break to get a drink from the bar.

“I’ll have whatever you recommend” Alexia said to the bartender, who nodded and then went about making her drink.

“Wow” a voice said behind her. She turned finding a male behind her, looking her up and down. He was handsome but had an arrogance to him that told her he was probably a warrior. “You look like you are an angel who fell from heaven.” He said giving her a smile that was probably supposed to make her swoon but instead repulsed her. “So was lucifer” She said giving him a wicked smile before grabbing her drink and returning to her friends leaving the male stunned.

""What did you say to that guy? He looks terrified?"" Edmund asked her when she returned to the group. Smiling Alexia responded with ""Oh nothing. Hopefully rethinking his life or at least his pickup line.""

""Wicked woman"" he muttered shaking his head.

She began dancing again but being unmarked for a female was like a welcome sign to douchebags. A guy came up behind her on the dance floor putting his hand on her waist. ""Remove your hand before I remove it for you"" she growled. He laughed and before he could finish his laugh she grabed his arm snapping his wrist. He immediatly stepped back holding his wrist ""You Bitch!"" He yelled with anger in his eyes that quickly simmered into fear when Luca, Edmund, Chris, and Thomas stood behind her.

""You were saying"" Luca said mockingly, staring him down.

""Didn't your mother teach not to touch a lady without her permission?"" Edmund asked toying with him.

""I-I'm s-sorry"" he stumbled ""p-please forgive me?"" he said looking at Alexia with eyes the size of saucers.

She waited. Starring him down in a way that made him tremble. After a minute had passed she said ""Go and do not let me see you again."" As soon as the words were out of her mouth he ran for the exit.

""Well now it's a party"" Chris said laughing.

They promptly resumed their dancing, forgetting the ordeal completely. Edmund took Alexia's hand as the DJ switched to salsa song. She swayed her hips as he moved his feet, getting lost in the music.

After a few dances she paused for another drink. This time Tabatha and Hazel accompanied her.

""So tell us"" Tab started. ""Were you disappointed that your mate wasn't Edmund?"" she said in a hushed voice to make sure the boys did not overhear them.

""Yes and No"" she responded hesitantly. ""I mean... I would have loved to have known and been friends with my mate but our relationship has always been friendly and not romantic."" She said as she watched Edmund on the dance floor with another female.

""That makes sense"" Hazel said in agreement. ""I do wonder who y'alls mates are though.... I imagine with who you are they are definetly going to be strong. I bet we find out at Leadership training."" She said confindently.

""I agree and I think your mate is going to be strong and handsome"" Tabatha said smiling at Alexia.

""I will drink to that!"" Alexia said cheerfully as the three girls clinked their glasses togther.",1,1747238222.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

So my sleep schedule has been pretty bad this last week . Staying up all night around 12am until 1pm the next day then sleeping from 1-9/10pm. 

I’m trying to fix it today by staying awake all day and sleeping around 9-11pm. 
 
The thing is I don’t ever drink coffee like ever I had stopped cause I would get super jittery and anxiety cause of it . 
Last time I drank coffee was December 2024 cause I needed to stay awake and I was running off 3 hours of sleep and surprisingly I did good and didn’t get bad reaction. 

**My question is should I get a half decaf iced white chocolate mocha at Starbucks or get it regularly how it is and not ask for half decaf**

I don’t want to get half decaf and it only lasts me 3/4 hours . I need to stay awake until 9pm ! 
Do you all think half decaf can potentially help me so I don’t run the risk of going full caffeine and reacting bad or should I take the risk? Thank you all .

This is all in theory as i don’t have the syrups because they’re expensive and i want to know if this will work or has worked for anyone before. 

To make whipped cream for an iced coffee you need powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and some vanilla syrup. Instead of vanilla syrup if i use “ toasted marshmallow” coffee syrup…would that make the whipped cream taste like marshmallow fluff? Would i be successful in creating a marshmallow whipped cream? 

Similarly if i replaced the vanilla with cinnamon or pumpkin spice syrup would that result in cinnamon or pumpkin spiced whipped cream? 

I’m wondering because i’m thinking maybe the whipped cream wouldn’t whip properly if i add liquids such as syrup into it? Maybe it would be too dense and not whippy? I want to make my iced coffees more creative than just a simple vanilla, caramel, hazelnut flavoured latte. I was thinking of infused whipped creams instead? 

Do you think an infused cold foam with syrup would be a better idea than whipped cream?

1kmiprd,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kmiprd/discover_if_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_trio_coffee/,Discover if Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio Coffee Maker is the perfect choice review!,"The **Hamilton Beach 49902** has been my daily go-to coffee maker for the past few weeks, and let me just say, it’s been an interesting experience. As someone who alternates between brewing coffee for just myself and occasionally hosting friends over for a caffeine-fueled book club, this coffee maker seemed to check all the boxes for flexibility and ease of use. But like anything, it has its outstanding moments and a few quirks too.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this coffee maker pumps out a fresh cup. In single-serve mode, I can literally have a steaming cup of joe in about 90 seconds. It's a lifesaver on rushed mornings when my toddler is tugging at my pants for cereal. Brew times compared to other coffee makers I’ve tried—like single-serve-focused Keurigs—are just as fast, but what stands out here is the machine’s ability to brew 12 full cups in one go using ground coffee. With its 56-ounce water reservoir, I can make several single cups before needing to refill, which is super handy.

**Check [Hamilton Beach 49902] price on Amazon.**

**Design and Build**  
Aesthetically, it’s not a showpiece, but it does feature a sleek black finish that blends into my kitchen without hogging the counter space. The coffee maker measures 13.8"" deep, 15.6"" wide, and 14"" high, so it’s compact enough not to overwhelm smaller kitchens. I appreciate the visibly labeled controls and the Easy-Touch programming feature, so setting up a brew the night before is as simple as pressing a few buttons. The backlit display is a nice touch, especially for groggy mornings.

**Versatility and Brewing Options**  
Here’s where the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew delivers its charm: the options. Whether I’m in the mood for a bold mug of coffee or need a whole pot brewed for a family breakfast, the Select-a-Brew strength selector gives the freedom to customize. Brewing with pods is straightforward, and the removable cup rest, which doubles as a stash spot for the pod holder or brew basket, is nifty. I also love that I can brew into a travel mug when I’m heading out the door. The adjustable brewing sizes (6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces for ground coffee, and up to 10 ounces for pods) ensure no coffee goes wasted.

**Assets**  
- Fast brewing: Single-serve in 90 seconds.  
- Versatile for both pod and ground coffee lovers.  
- Programmable with a backlit display for hassle-free mornings.  
- Compatible for brewing into regular cups or travel mugs.  
- Dishwasher-safe glass carafe and a pod-piercing needle that’s easy to clean.  

**Potentials for Improvement**  
- The single-serve brewing needle, while removable for cleaning, occasionally clogs if not cleaned regularly.  
- It’s a bit noisy during operation—nothing jarring, but noticeable.  
- The design doesn’t scream ""premium,"" so don’t expect this to enhance your kitchen’s visual aesthetics.  
- Water splashes over the carafe lid occasionally while brewing the full 12 cups, though minor.  

**Competing Products**  
Competing coffee makers like the Keurig K-Duo and Ninja DualBrew popped to mind while testing this. The Keurig K-Duo offers similar pod-and-ground versatility but doesn’t brew as quickly in single-cup mode. Ninja’s DualBrew might be more stylish and boasts enhanced brewing strength control, but it comes at a slightly heftier price. In terms of cost-effectiveness and performance balance, the Hamilton Beach edges ahead by offering the essential bells and whistles without overwhelming with unnecessary extras.

**True Value**  
The cost quality of this coffee maker feels justifiable. It strikes a remarkable balance between versatility, performance, and accessibility, especially if you’re someone who appreciates both pod convenience and the rich flavor of ground coffee. Though not the flashiest or most silent machine on the market, it delivers consistent results, making it a strong contender for households with staggered coffee needs.

On Isabella Bennett's birthday, she waited all night. But Dominic Hinton never returned.  
  
His first love Chloe Winslow was marrying the infamous playboy in their circle today.  
  
He couldn't bare her ruin her life and rush off to stop the wedding.  
  
With swollen eyes, she sat alone in the living room all night. By morning, she received a call from an unfamiliar number.  
  
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""  
  
Hearing that nonchalant tone, Isabella instantly pictured the man of cynicism. The very playboy Dominic's precious Chloe was supposed to marry.  
  
""Lucas Montgomery?""  
  
""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" Lucas laughed with mischief. ""So I'm here to steal his. Fair's fair, right?""  
  
Isabella fell silent for a moment, then shook her head slightly. ""Seems fair enough.""  
  
On the other end, Lucas arched an eyebrow and said confidently.  
  
""Perfect. I'll arrange another wedding in fifteen days. Get yourself a dress and wait for me to marry you.""  
  
Then the line went dead.  
  
Isabella stared at the cold dinner spread across the table, tears suddenly welling in her eyes.  
  
She never imagined that after all these years of waiting, she'd finally received a proposal.  
  
But the proposal wasn't from Dominic. The groom wasn't Dominic.  
  
And the man she'd be marrying wasn't Dominic either.  
  
...  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.  
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.  
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.  
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.  
  
""Who the fuck are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.  
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.  
  
He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.  
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The trash truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless shit.”  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who the hell gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through trash.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.  
  
“The trash truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.  
  
“It was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.”  
  
Isabella’s breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.  
  
That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.  
  
No wonder he was so desperate.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The tension inside the car thickened into silence.  
  
Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.  
  
""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""  
  
These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.  
  
The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.  
  
And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn’t meant anything legally for years—was because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.  
  
The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.  
  
She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.  
  
""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""  
  
Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. “Lucas found someone new? Who told you that?”  
  
Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.  
  
But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.  
  
The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.  
  
""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I’m gonna die in there! What should I do?""  
  
""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.  
  
He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""  
  
Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.  
  
She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.  
  
After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.  
  
The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of trash under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.  
  
Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.  
  
After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.  
  
Then the housekeeper called.  
  
""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must’ve slipped there while he was sleeping.”  
  
Isabella let out a bitter laugh.  
  
How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?  
  
And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.  
  
Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.  
  
Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.  
  
She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.  
  
Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.  
  
Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.  
  
""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""  
  
Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.  
  
The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.  
  
The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.  
  
""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees—was now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.  
  
Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.  
  
Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella’s chest, leaving her gasping for air.  
  
The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.  
  
The room wasn’t fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.  
  
""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why the hell would you take the punishment for me?”  
  
Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.  
  
“I did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""  
  
""I love you, and I didn’t want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""  
  
Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.  
  
""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn’t you?""  
  
Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.  
  
Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?  
  
Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.  
  
The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.  
  
But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.  
  
""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""  
  
""Dominic’s never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?”  
  
In that moment, Isabella finally understood—marrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.  
  
All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.  
  
Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.  
  
Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.  
  
The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.  
  
""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""  
  
Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.  
  
“Played him? What exactly did I ‘play’? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me—I never forced him to do anything.""  
  
""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""  
  
Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.  
  
She couldn’t even deny it. Because Chloe was right.  
  
“Yes, he made his choice. And I respect it. Don't worry, I'm stepping aside. You two enjoy yourselves.”

So about 8 months ago, I started hanging out with this girl through a group of mutual friends. We’d play sports during the summer, and in the winter we’d grab coffee or go out to eat every now and then. Just a casual friendship at first.

A couple months ago, I started asking her to hang out more often—still casual, like going to a cafe to plan a trip we’re taking this August. One of our friends tagged along that time, so it wasn’t just the two of us. Lately though, I’ve been the one picking her up whenever we go out to play sports.

A couple weeks ago, we played badminton with a different group after work (we’ve worked together for about a year), and after that we grabbed boba and checked out some stores. Then we decided to get lunch together. After that day, I realized my feelings were growing. What started as a small crush a few months ago is turning into something deeper.

Last week, we played badminton again after work, then she actually invited me to a coworker’s event at a restaurant (kind of a lowkey live music/rap night). We had a few hours before the event, so we went and played tennis, got ice cream, and took a walk by the river. We talked about family stuff, shared laughs, and just sat and chilled. It felt special—like I wanted to freeze time.

At the event, we got a table for two and both dressed nice. Honestly, it really felt like a date.

Now I can’t stop thinking about her. I think I really like her, but I’m hesitant to say anything. We work together, and we also have this upcoming trip abroad in August. If I confess and she doesn’t feel the same, I don’t want things to get awkward between us or ruin the trip.

Any advice on what to do? Should I wait until after the trip? Or is there a better way to approach this?

This is all in theory as i don’t have the syrups because they’re expensive and i want to know if this will work or has worked for anyone before. 

To make whipped cream for an iced coffee you need powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and some vanilla syrup. Instead of vanilla syrup if i use “ toasted marshmallow” coffee syrup…would that make the whipped cream taste like marshmallow fluff? Would i be successful in creating a marshmallow whipped cream? 

Similarly if i replaced the vanilla with cinnamon or pumpkin spice syrup would that result in cinnamon or pumpkin spiced whipped cream? 

I’m wondering because i’m thinking maybe the whipped cream wouldn’t whip properly if i add liquids such as syrup into it? Maybe it would be too dense and not whippy? I want to make my iced coffees more creative than just a simple vanilla, caramel, hazelnut flavoured latte. I was thinking of infused whipped creams instead?

""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala—clearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite—the one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing—gotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

“Fate is not an eagle, it creeps like a rat.”

– Elizabeth Bowen

If you were to ask my parents to describe my older brother, they’d tell you he was a natural leader. Fearless and courageous, the kind of man born to lead armies.

And if you asked them to describe my sister, they’d gush about her sweet disposition and her selfless heart.

But me?

There’s only one word my parents would use to describe me: human.

You might not think that ""human"" could be used as an insult, but somehow, I’ve spent my entire life wearing this word like a badge of shame. When I showed up on my Alpha father’s doorstep at twelve, he told the rest of the pack that I was there because of my human mother’s failure. I was thrust into the wolf pack – literally – but my status as the only human there made me an instant outcast. I couldn’t run or wrestle or shift into wolves like the rest of the neighborhood kids. I’d never meet my mate or experience that instantaneous true love that mated pairs had.

I was still the Alpha’s kid, and while that might’ve saved me from the bullies, it didn’t mean I fit in. The werewolf world was drastically different from the human one, and to them, my humanity was a weakness.

My father never told me he was ashamed of me, but I could still feel his disappointment – it hung in the air every time he called me his human daughter or explained that I was the product of a short affair with a human woman eighteen-years-ago.

My stepmom, my father’s true mate, did try to make me feel included. She was the epitome of the perfect Luna – gentle and good-natured – but I could still tell she was ashamed of me. If there was ever evidence that her family wasn’t perfect, I was living proof of it. Every time she looked at me, she was reminded that her mate had cheated on her.

Try as they might, none of this made a good recipe for the perfect family. I’d spent six years living under my father’s roof, in his pack, and in the werewolf world, but I’d already accepted that I’d never fit in there.

\*Or so I thought. \*

Despite making plans to go to college far, far away from the pack that had no room for me, my life was about to change completely. Something – technically, someone – was about to ensure that there was plenty of space in the werewolf world for this ordinary little human.

\*Dear Clark Bellevue,

After carefully reviewing your application, it is with regret that we inform you that we are unable to offer you admission into the University of Florida at this time. We appreciate the time and effort put into your application, but unfortunately, this year’s large pool of applicants has made our decision difficult and we have limited space for each admitted class.

We are confident you will go on to achieve great things in your studies, and we wish you the best in your academic journey!

\*Best Regards,

Dean of Admissions

University of Florida\*

I read the rejection email at least five different times, my eyes darting across the screen for something I might’ve missed. Unfortunately, there was no hidden message to be found – it was just another generic rejection email from another college that didn’t want me. My senior year of high school was ending, and although I had applied to an endless list of colleges, I’d only received three rejections and one waitlist.

Most of the schools I applied for were state schools with decent academic records – but really, all I cared about was finding a college that was far away. Somewhere far enough where I’d have an excuse not to make it home on the weekends or for most holidays.

Given that I lived in cold, rainy Washington, Florida’s sunny (and distant) climate would’ve been perfect – but it didn’t look like that was going to happen.

“Clark!”

My pity party got cut short by the sound of my sister, Lily, yelling my name. I barely had time to exit out of my Gmail screen before Lily was bursting into my room without even a knock.

“Clark, I’ve been calling you for the past five minutes,” she sighed, leaning against my door frame, “Were you watching another trashy reality show or just tuning out my voice?”

Although we were half-sisters, Lily and I hardly looked alike. She was tall, fair-skinned, with long, blonde locks that never seemed frizzy or out-of-control. Her and my brother both shared my father’s bright, blue eyes. Her eyes were her best feature, and they constantly seemed like they were trying to poke beneath the surface.

“Sorry, I wasn’t trying to tune you out, Lil,” I said, “What’s up?”

Her piercing blue eyes narrowed, but she seemed to accept my apology. “Dad wants to see us, there’s a big meeting tonight at the pack house. A bunch of people are going to be there.”

My eyebrows furrowed. Pack meetings weren’t unusual for our pack, but I wasn’t usually required to attend. As Blacktooth Pack’s only resident human, I wasn’t a huge part of pack business. I couldn’t shift, which meant I couldn’t participate in patrols or defend the pack.

“Why is dad asking for me?” I asked.

“Not sure,” Lily shrugged, “He just told me to come get you. I’m sure it’s for a good reason, dad wouldn’t bring you around if it wasn’t. Come on.”

Lily didn’t waste any more time waiting for me, and I watched her strut out of the room.

Not even the golden child knows why I’m being summoned, I thought, this must be important then.

I followed Lily out of my room, and we descended the stairs in silence. With high ceilings and hardwood floors, our family house was one of the largest in the pack – a perk that came with being part of the Alpha’s family. Photos of Lily and my brother, Sebastian’s, accomplishments hung on the walls like the trophies they were: Lily as a baby, Seb at his first pack football game, Lily at prom with her friends.

As I expected, Dad, Seb, and Grace were all waiting in the living room. Dad lounged in the recliner like it was his throne with Grace perched on his lap while Sebastian stood awkwardly by the mantel.

“Ah, girls, there you are,” Dad said, and his booming voice echoed around the room, “We’ve got a pack meeting tonight and we’ll need both of you there.”

Even in his forties, my dad didn’t look a day over thirty. He shared the same fair hair and blue eyes as Lily, and his strong jawline and intimidating frame made him look every bit like the Alpha wolf he was.

My older half-brother, Sebastian, was just as tall as my dad, but he got his chestnut brown hair from his mother, Grace. Grace – or Luna Grace if you weren’t her step-daughter – was my dad’s true mate and Seb and Lily’s biological mom. She was the final piece to this picture-perfect family my dad had created.

“Why is Clark coming to the meeting tonight?” Sebastian asked, glancing over at me. He didn’t mean it as an insult – like me, he knew I was rarely needed (or wanted) at pack meetings.

“We’ll talk about it at the meeting,” dad said, standing up with Grace, “Is everyone ready? It’ll be starting soon, we should head over.”

We all nodded.

“Oh, Clark, honey,” Grace piped up from my dad’s side, “Are you sure you don’t want to change? That outfit might be a little casual for a pack meeting.”

I glanced down at my jeans and plain black t-shirt – it wasn’t exactly glamorous, but nobody else was dressed up either. Seb had on a t-shirt and shorts, and Lily rocked a jean skirt and some sort of ruffle top.

“If it’s okay, I’ll just wear this,” I said. Grace nodded, but I could see her eyes do another sweep over my outfit.

It’s not as if I’m going to be the center of attention here, I thought, the elders will be too busy with dad, the pack warriors are going to have their eyes glued to Lily’s ass, and any unmated girls will be flirting with my brother.

If I was lucky, I’d blend into the background – and frankly, that was exactly where I wanted to be at these sorts of events.

“Enough hanging around, let’s go,” My dad grumbled, taking Grace’s hand. He led the way out of the house, Seb, Lily, and I trailing behind him like puppies – no pun intended. We walked in silence, and I took a moment to appreciate the scenery.

Our pack lived in its own forested community, which meant that most places, like the pack house, were still within walking distance. Family houses lined one side of the street, but you’d eventually run into a pack-run grocery store and infirmary if you kept walking. Pack members were allowed to leave whenever they wanted, but the setup of our community meant that you rarely needed to.

And, if you did need to, you’d still have to answer to the guards that protected our borders. They wouldn’t keep you in, but they did make it much harder to sneak out.

The little residential part of the community was just a small part of the pack, though – most of our territory was just wooded areas where wolves could run, play, and shift anytime they wanted to.

For werewolves, this was the ideal setup.

As a human who wouldn’t label themselves as “outdoorsy,” living an hour from the nearest town wasn’t exactly a high point. I wasn’t a prisoner by any means, but there were times when living in Blacktooth territory did make me feel trapped.

With guards running every inch of the property, it was hard to just come and go as I pleased. And since I wasn’t a werewolf, I couldn’t just shift and run through the woods on four legs like my siblings could whenever I wanted some fresh air.

Whether I wanted to be or not, I was a human living in the wolf’s den.

# Chapter 2

“Outcasts always mourn.”

– Oscar Wilde

The walk to the pack house was short, and within ten minutes, we were walking through its massive foyer. The pack house was the biggest home in our territory, and since it was used for meetings, parties, or other pack events, it was made to house close to a thousand people if needed. It was designed like one massive log cabin with chairs, couches, bean bags, and other furniture scattered throughout the living room.

From the moment we walked in the door, there were people.

\*Everywhere. \*

The elders of our pack were seated on the couches, sipping their coffee and engaging in small talk. A couple of mated couples cuddled up on love seats and chairs, completely tuned out to everything but each other. Some of the pack warriors stood around laughing and joking in groups, most of them unmated or keeping their mates at home.

As soon as my father stepped through the door, a gradual silence swept over the room and all eyes fell on us. The conversation ceased and many people inclined their heads in respect for my father.

I could feel curious gazes on me too – most of them were probably wondering why the human girl was at the meeting, just like I was. While Grace disappeared to one of the couches to sit with some of the female elders, my dad and Seb took front-and-center in the room. Lily and I both snagged an empty couch, although she was already waving some of her friends over.

Unlike me, my sister was a social butterfly, and as the Alpha’s daughter, she might’ve well have been the pack princess. Girls wanted to be her friend, and boys crossed their fingers that they’d be lucky enough to have Lily as a mate.

Lily hadn’t met her mate yet, but at eighteen, it could happen anytime. Werewolves could identify their mates at sixteen, and it wasn’t unusual for most wolves to find them within a year or two. By eighteen or nineteen, most of the unmated wolves I’d met were antsy about finding their “true loves” – they wanted to get married and start popping out babies immediately.

For a brief moment, I wondered if that would happen to Lily too. If my headstrong, good-natured sister would turn into another docile wife with a pregnant belly by the end of the year. That was the expectation for female werewolves, but for some reason, the thought unsettled me.

“Attention, everyone,” my dad clapped his hands together, although all eyes were already on him, “I’ve called you here today to discuss something important – something that has already begun affecting our pack.”

As my dad spoke, my brother stood strong beside him, arms crossed and ready to back up whatever he said.

“As you may have heard whispers from other packs, there are tensions rising in the werewolf world,” dad said, “Two of the largest packs in the country, the Crescent Moon pack and the Pacific Rock pack, have been on the brink of a war for the past two months. If their conflict does escalate, it won’t just be blood from their packs that get shed. Both packs have alliances across the country – we’ve even got a long-standing alliance with the Pacific Rock pack, and if they call upon us to help, I’ll have to send warriors to fight.”

I could hear a few gasps across the room, and some of the elders began to whisper.

“What even started this conflict? Why is the Crescent Moon pack at odds with the Pacific Rock wolves?” One of the younger male warriors piped up from the side of the room.

My father sighed. “It started the same way that most of these conflicts start: by wolves trying to claim things that aren’t theirs. The Crescent Moon’s new Alpha is ambitious and he’s been trying to expand his pack lands since he took over. For the past few months, they’ve been steadily creeping into Pacific Rock territory.”

While I’d heard my father grumbling about this latest conflict to Sebastian or Grace at home, this was the first time I’d heard about it in such detail. It wasn’t unusual either – since I’d been living in the werewolf world, I’d heard countless stories of packs trying to take over other packs or warring for territories. Werewolves were possessive about everything, and that included their lands.

However, this was the first time I’d been subject to a conflict that might affect my own pack. My father was a good Alpha, and he’d spent his entire rule trying to stay out of territory disputes and other conflicts with nearby packs.

“I know this must sound worrying,” my father continued, “But I don’t believe it will escalate to a war. The Alpha King is aware of the dispute, and he doesn’t want this to turn into an out-of-control war with both sides trying to call on alliances. He believes that both Alphas can come to an understanding as long as they meet on neutral ground with the King himself present.”

Ah, the mysterious, all-powerful Alpha King. At least this guy is finally doing his job.

Ever since I’d been in the werewolf world, I’d been hearing about the Alpha King. I’d never met the guy or even seen a picture of him, but from what I understood, he was the closest thing the werewolves had to a monarch – and a celebrity.

He had his own territory and pack, but he ruled over everyone. He was the Alpha of Alphas wolves – the one that ruled them all. His word was final, and while he didn’t usually get involved in pack business, he might step in special cases. Like, you know, to prevent a war.

Last I’d heard, the current Alpha King was around my dad’s age, but he was grooming his son to take over when he died. I didn’t know much about the King’s son either, but then again, it’s not as if I was the hub for all-things-werewolf-knowledge. Besides what I heard around the house or the bare-bones explanation my dad gave me about pack hierarchy and wolf biology when I started living with him, I was still pretty clueless.

“This is good news then,” said one of the elders, a wrinkled, old man gripping onto his coffee cup for dear life, “The Alpha King will surely placate both packs. Is there something else you’re worried about, Alpha?”

My dad sighed and crossed his arms, “There is one other thing. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ve gathered so many of you here tonight.” Briefly, he made eye contact with me.

Guess we’re about to get to the good stuff here then.

“The Alpha King sees this as an opportunity to strengthen alliances and understandings for every pack – not just the Crescent Moon and Pacific Rock wolves. He’s asked each Alpha to send their children as diplomats.”

Beside me, Lily inhaled sharply and I watched Sebastian’s eyes widen.

I’d watched my dad leave for diplomatic trips and meetings before, but never my brother or sister – most packs wanted to deal with the current Alpha, not the future one.

“Why Alpha children?” The same elder asked, “Sebastian is still years from taking over your position. What benefit would it be for us to send such young wolves?”

A couple of people nodded in agreement across the room, and I couldn’t disagree with the elder’s logic. As long as my dad didn’t die unexpectedly, Sebastian wouldn’t be the Alpha for years to come and it didn’t make much sense to send Lily either. As a female wolf, she maybe had a small chance of becoming Alpha if dad and Seb both died – but that would only be after she proved herself to the pack.

I guess the only upside here is that if Lily and Sebastian have to leave on some diplomatic wolf mission, I’ll get the house to myself (and free reign of Lily’s closets).

“The Alpha King believes that it’s important for the future of the werewolf world to learn how to cohabitate now – before they’re handed real power and given titles. He thinks teaching them to be diplomats might prevent further disputes like the one we’re in the midst of now.”

“Is that all?” The elder asked.

“Well,” my dad said, and I could see he was reluctant to say this next part, “That was the reasoning he’s given us as Alphas, and I do believe it explains why he wants the future Alphas there. However, I have a feeling there’s another ulterior motive at play. The King has asked for every Alpha child, including our daughters. His son has just turned twenty-five and he’s still mateless. I believe this is another opportunity for the prince to search for his mate.”

“All Alpha daughters?” Another elder spoke, and almost every eye in the room landed on me.

No, there’s no way I’m included in this.

I’m human, that’s an automatic pass out of most werewolf events, especially diplomatic pack meetings.

My dad turned to me, his eyes full of concern. “Unfortunately, yes, that means that he’ll want to see my human daughter, Clark, too. She’ll be attending the meeting with her siblings.”

Mikael smiled as he saw the name on the screen when his mobile phone rang.

“Hello my friend, how are things?” he answered.

“Hi, Mike. It’s good, how are things at your end?” Graham asked.

“Quiet and a little boring now that the rogues have been dealt with. How are the Beans?” Mikael smiled.

“Growing at an alarming rate. I don’t know what Ellie is feeding them, but they are growing while I watch them,” Graham chuckled.

Mikael was happy for his friend. He sounded truly happy and content. No one deserved it more than Graham.

“And Bella?” Mikael asked.

“You know Ellie, there is nothing she doesn’t excel at. I truly have no idea how I survived before I had her,” Graham confessed, and Mikael could hear the love in his friend’s voice.

“I have been admiring how well she has managed to cope with not sleeping at night. If it was for Theo, we would get a full night’s sleep every night. But Stella isn’t that peaceful, and since she wakes her brother, Ellie and I tag team.,” Graham told him.

“I have been a walking zombie and Ellie has even offered to stay a couple of nights at her dad’s with the Beans so I could get some sleep,” he continued.

“Let me guess, your alpha pride won’t let you admit she can handle it when you can’t?” Mikael chuckled.

“Partly that, and partly because I wouldn’t get any sleep without her, and I don’t think I would be able to let the Beans that far away. I’ve been thinking she was some kind of super wolf, managing her luna duties on no sleep,” Graham said.

“Then yesterday, I needed to ask her something just after lunch. I could have mind-linked her, but why do that when I can walk over and actually talk to her?” Mikael’s friend told him.

“Yes, I’m sure you only were thinking about talking,” Mikael smiled.

“Shut up. So, I walked into her office and the Beans weren’t there and Bella was sleeping on the couch. Of course, me barging in wakes her. When I ask her what was happening, she tells me it was her nap time. She and Mickey have been trading babies. He takes the Beans for an hour to let Bella nap, then she takes them and Mavis back so he can nap,” Graham said, sounding utterly surprised.

“Then I asked if that is why she has been so rested. She says yes, and that she was assuming I was also napping during the day. Then she asked me the big question, why hadn’t I been napping since she has the Beans most of the day,” Graham continued.

“What did you say?” Mikael asked, curious why his friend hadn’t taken naps.

“Because Ellie hadn’t told me I should,” his friend mumbled.

Mikael laughed so hard that he was crying. He actually had to put his phone down for a moment to brace himself.

“Some alpha you are,” he finally managed to say as his breathing returned to normal and he wiped his tears away.

“Yes, I have become useless without her,” Graham agreed.

“As much as I enjoy ravelling in your uselessness, I’m thinking you had another reason for calling?” Mikael asked.

“I did. Do you remember the investigator down south that was obsessed with Ellie?” Graham said.

“Yes, didn’t he get suspended?” Mikael answered.

“He did, and then he disappeared. This was around the time the pups were born, so I didn’t want Ellie to worry. I asked the Mistvalley pack to have one of their agents look into it. Alpha Brutus was kind enough to put one of his best agents on it when he heard it was for Ellie’s peace of mind,” Graham told him.

“Your mate is loved by everyone on the alpha council, I think,” Mikael smiled.

“I’m well aware,” Graham grumbled.

“Anyway. I have heard back from Brutus, and his agent has tracked Frank to your neck of the woods,” he continued.

“And you wanted to know if I would grant this agent access to our pack land and a place to stay?” Mikael finished the sentence.

“Yes”

“For Bella, it would be my pleasure. They are welcome and I will make sure to give them any help they will need,” Mikael said.

“Thank you, my friend. It means a lot to me,” Graham told him.

“Don’t mention it. Bella has always been a friend to my pack. I haven’t forgotten her generosity when we first met. Neither have my men, or Diana for that matter. They have been almost obsessed with me finding a mate since they saw how your luna is.” Mikael smiled.

“Ellie has that effect on people. Don’t worry, my friend, your time will come,” Graham told him.

“You know that I’m cursed, my friend. That is not in my future,” Mikael sighed.

“You are a full-grown alpha, Mike. You need to get over what happened. You are not cursed,” Graham told him.

“Okay,” Mikael agreed.

“That was not you agreeing with me, Mike. That was you trying to change the subject. You were a teenager, you had no power, and there was nothing you could have done. At least it led to some change in the pack,” Graham said.

“It did,” Mikael agreed.

There was a loud scream in the background of Graham’s call.

“Hold on one moment, Mike,” Graham said.

There was a moment of screaming and then silence.

“Hello, Mike. Sorry about this. Stella needed her dad. She can be such a daddy’s girl sometimes,” Bella suddenly said.

“Hello Bella, no problem. If Gray has another female that has him wrapped around his finger, does that mean I can finally snatch you away?” Mikael smiled.

Bella laughed at the other end. Mikael truly loved his friend’s mate. She was like a combination of a friend and a little sister. He had liked her just for the smile she had put on his friend’s face the first time Graham had introduced them. But she had become so much more to him since then.

“Mike, you truly are the biggest flirt,” Bella smiled.

“Tell Mike he needs to find his own mate to flirt with,” Mikael could hear Graham shouting.

“He isn’t wrong, you know,” Bella told him.

“I will keep my eyes open,” Mikael promised her. He hadn’t shared that part of his past with Bella, and he knew Graham wouldn’t do it without asking him.

“Good, Gray has soothed the beast, so I’m handing him the phone. Take care, Mike,” Bella said.

“You too, luna,” he smiled.

“Sorry about that, Mike,” Graham said.

“No need at all, my friend. Family life suits you,” Mikael told him.

“I’m as surprised as the next one,” Graham confessed.

They talked for a while longer to arrange a date for the agent from Mistvalley to come, and some other things. As Mikael hung up the call, his eyes went to the little glass case on his desk.

It had been specially made to hold its precious content. On a midnight-blue velvet stand, the amber necklace he had got from Rayvin was displayed.

He had been looking for her for almost eight years. But it was like she had vanished from the face of the earth.

Even though she didn’t know it, Rayvin’s departure from the pack had been the beginning of the end for Mikael’s father as the alpha of the pack. Once word had got out about how he had banished the young girl, based only on what the Beta’s daughter had said. The smouldering ambers of discontent that had already existed, ignited.

It was clear the accusations of Milly had been unfounded and even if no one but Mikael said so openly, they all knew they had been outright lies. But as they lacked proof of this, the official version was that she had misunderstood something she overheard.

Almost a year after Rayvin had left the pack, Mikael’s father had officially been asked to step aside as alpha and hand the position over to Mikael.

Since that day, Mikael had worked hard on two things. He was determined to make his pack a place where anyone would feel safe and welcome. Fortunately for him, most of his pack shared his vision, and they had become a tight-knit pack with good values.

His second goal had been to find Rayvin and bring her home to where she belonged. He had never succeeded with that. And that is what he saw as the root cause of his curse. Part of him believed the goddess wouldn’t let him find his mate until he righted the wrong he had let happen. The other part of him still held out hope Rayvin was his mate.

It was pure wishful thinking on his part. Maybe the remnants of a teenage crush that didn’t get to fade away naturally.

Maybe he could get a feel for this agent from the Mistvalley pack. If they were reliable, he could hire them to look for Rayvin, Mikael thought. It was worth the steep price to get some peace of mind.

There was a knock on the door to Mikael’s office.

‘Mike, it’s time for the meeting with the elders,’ Ben, his beta, mind linked him.

‘I’m on my way. I have a new topic to add to the meeting,’ Mikael answered as he got up and grabbed his tablet. He walked out of his office and joined Ben, that was waiting for him.

“What is this new topic?” Ben asked as they made their way down to the ground floor of the pack house.

Ben was running his hand through his bright red hair. Something he always did when trying to get a grip on an unfamiliar situation. Ben was an excellent beta but needed to know everything about everything. He had significantly relaxed since meeting his mate, Diana, a couple of years back. But he still felt uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations.

“We are going to have a guest from the Mistvalley pack staying here. They are working for Gray and need access to the area,” Mikael explained.

“Sounds like fun. We wouldn’t want to get bored or anything,” Ben sighed.

Mikael knew that if his beta had the power, he would make sure that nothing exciting or unexpected ever happened. Luckily for all of them, he didn’t have that power.

“It will be fine, they will stay with us, but I’m assuming they will spend most of their time off pack land, investigating,” Mikael laughed and patted his betas shoulder.

“Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, I guess,” Ben nodded.

“That’s the spirit. Diana and I will turn you into an adventurer one of these days,” Mikael said.

# 2, Going back

Rayvin was sitting in her car and was staring at the phone in her hand. The conversation she had had with alpha Brutus just moments ago still shocked her. She had expected him to understand why she had asked to hand over the case to someone else.

She had done most of the heavy lifting, and the man was a human. He wasn’t exactly hard to track. But her alpha had said no.

“Auga, we don’t give up halfway to our goal. How would it look if I let you off the hook on this one? We always follow through on our missions. And this is for luna Bella, nothing but the best will do,” he had told her.

“Fuck,” she angrily shouted and banged her fist against the steering wheel.

She had a valid reason not to do this mission and alpha Brutus knew it. All the talk about sticking to the mission was bullshit. This was one of his ‘face your demons and grow as a warrior’ life lessons. That was the only reason she could think of for him to be sending her back to the one place she didn’t want to go.

The Whiteriver pack. Rayvin hadn’t thought she would ever think of going back there. In fact, she had spent years making sure that there were no traces that could tie her to that pack.

Rayvin took a deep breath and started her car, a silver-coloured Prius. It wasn’t the fanciest car. Which was the whole point of it. No one looked twice at it, it blended into most surroundings and was quiet to drive. Everything she needed.

She drove to a drive-through and ordered their largest black coffee and an array of doughnuts. If she was going to do this, she needed her two favourite drugs, caffeine and sugar.

She could fly up north and rent a car. But then she would have to use a fake name and even then, it would leave a paper trace. If she drove, she would have a couple of days to figure out how to handle this.

As Rayvin prepared for the long drive and fed the coordinates into her GPS she thought back nine years. The moment she had been dropped off by the bus stop, she had pulled out her phone and dialled the number entered as Emergency B.

“Brutus Windwalker,” a man had answered.

At first, Rayvin hadn’t known what to say. She had remained silent until the alpha had asked if there was anyone there.

Rayvin had told him who she was and what had happened in a shaky voice. It had taken her almost half an hour to tell him everything.

“Where does the bus go?” alpha Brutus had asked her.

Rayvin did not know, but after consulting the sign at the bus stop, she told him the end destination was Detroit.

“Do you have enough money to buy a ticket?” he asked.

“Yes, and to stay in a motel for a couple of nights if necessary,” Rayvin told him.

“When you get on the bus, text me the time when you will arrive in Detroit. My men will be waiting for you. They will ask if your name is Auga. You can trust them,” alpha Brutus told her.

“Okay. What happens then?” she had asked.

“Then they will take you home,” he said.

“Home?”

“Yes, your new home is in my pack. Your father was a good friend of mine, more like a brother. His daughter will always have a home in my pack. My men will bring you home and you will rest for a while. Then we will talk about your future,” alpha Brutus had told her.

Rayvin had seventeen hours to think on that bus. She had done a lot of thinking, mostly about her father, this unknown man that she only remembered from her mother’s stories about him. And about Mikael.

Even after all this time, Rayvin still got a pang of longing in her stomach when she thought about Mikael. The friendship they had shared had meant the world to her growing up.

He had been her hero, the brave and strong protector that, together with Ben, had been the cornerstone in her childhood escapades. As they got older, her feelings for Mikael changed. Rayvin smiled at the thought of her crush on the alpha’s son.

It had been innocent, and she had never expected anything to come from it. Mikael would take over the pack and he was good-looking. The single females in the pack had all had their eyes on him.

But Rayvin knew he was waiting for his true mate. His parents had been chosen mates, and he had lived with the consequences of their choice. He always told Rayvin that he would never do that.

In the first months after going to live with the Mistvalley pack, Rayvin had fantasised about going back. To wait until Mikael became alpha and then ask if she could return.

Then alpha Brutus put her in contact with her family on her father’s side. After the first meeting, Rayvin knew she would never go back to the Whiteriver pack. She would never contact Mikael again.

Instead, she had turned to the training. If her experiences until then had taught her anything, it had been that she needed to be able to protect herself. Alpha Brutus had her using her special abilities, training them to the point where they became just as natural for her to use as shifting.

Her abilities easily made her one of the top agents within the pack. In the Mistvalley pack results, strength and usefulness were what mattered. A useless warrior was treated as lower in rank than a useful omega.

As she was driving toward North Dakota, Rayvin knew that this was the final test from her alpha. If she passed this test to his satisfaction, he would name her beta of the Mistvalley pack.

If she could prove that she truly had left her old life behind her, she would cease to be Rayvin and fully become Auga, the alias that had stuck from that first day.

Rayvin thought it was what she wanted. But she also doubted if it was possible for her to do. When she had heard that Mikael had been at the battle with the rogues, every fibre of her had wanted to go and just catch a glimpse of him.

But she hadn’t. She knew a glimpse wouldn’t be enough. She had focused on her part of the mission instead, and tried to block out the fact that he had been there.

Now she was driving straight into his pack. There would be no escaping meeting him, talking to him, and then leaving him again.

Rayvin pulled up to a cheap motel. She could afford better accommodations, but places like this took cash and didn’t ask too many questions. When she was spread out on top of the bed in her room, she tried to empty her mind to get some sleep.

It didn’t really work. She kept making up scenarios of what would happen the following day. Rayvin knew he had been looking for her and she felt guilty for making sure he wouldn’t succeed. She could have reached out and explained things. She should have done that, but she always had the feeling that she wouldn’t be able to walk away a second time.

Walking away from him the first time had nearly broken her. She didn’t want to think about how it would feel if she did it a second time. Now she didn’t have a choice.

That wasn’t technically true. She could disobey her alpha, say screw this to everything. But what then? Go live with her father’s family? Become a lone wolf? No, neither of those things was appealing.

She sighed and turned on her side. She was just going to be a big girl and suck it up. Rayvin would go to her old pack, and she would talk and be nice to her old friend and get the job done. Then she would leave and start training for her new position in the pack.

It was well past lunch the following day when Rayvin started getting close to the pack borders. The landscape looked like a Christmas card and she allowed herself to admit that she missed the snow. They got snow at home as well, but not like this, she thought as she looked at the jagged rocks and evergreen trees that were covered in a thick blanket of snow.

She started to recognise the surroundings and her wolf and the other creature inside of her both told her she was home. Irritated, Rayvin tried to tell them that this was not home. But the stupid animals wouldn’t listen to her.

She stopped a little bit away from the turnoff road that would lead her to the pack land. She erased the location from her GPS and, out of habit, scrubbed its memory. No need to get sloppy just because she knew where she was going.

As she drove down the gravel road, she was stopped by the gates by an unfamiliar wolf in a guard uniform. Rayvin assessed him as he walked over to her window. He looked like he knew what he was doing, she reluctantly thought.

“Goodday ma’am. Do you have a purpose visiting our pack land?” the guard asked.

Rayvin enjoyed the fleeting confusion she saw on his face as he scented her and could feel that she was a werewolf and something that he couldn’t place.

“Hello, yes, I’m here as a visitor. I’m the agent from Mistvalley,” she told him and made the effort to smile.

“You are expected, ma’am, your name?” he asked with a nod.

Rayvin would usually give one of her aliases, or at least give the nickname she used. But that wouldn’t do any good here.

“Rayvin Gullnauga,” she therefore said and watched as the guard mind linked someone.

“Sorry, ma’am, I need to see an ID,” he then told her. This time she smiled genuinely. Someone on the other end of that mind link knew who she was. She wondered who it was as she pulled out her real driver’s license from its hiding place in her glove compartment.

“Here you go,” she smiled at the guard and handed him her license.

He carefully examined the ID and then looked at her to confirm it was her. He then mind linked with someone again.

“Please follow the road until you see the pack house, a large timber-frame house. You really can’t miss it. The beta will be waiting for you there,” the guard smiled at her and handed back her driver’s licence.

“Thank you,” she smiled at him and waited for him to open the gate.

She drove the last part through the forest and smiled again as she drove across the bridge that took her over the river that had given the pack its name. As the forest opened up into the open area where the village and the pack house were, her animals once again told her they were home.

Rayvin wished that there was a way to shut them up as she drove through the village. She saw the gigantic pack house that stood at the foot of the rock formation at the other end of the village and the memories flooded back.

She focused on her breathing and did some exercises she used to slow her pulse in the field as she drove out of the village and started the final stretch up to the pack house.

She parked the car and got out.

“Well, call me stupid and drag my ass over a cheese grader, it really is you,” someone laughed.

Rayvin turned towards the voice and saw Ben walking towards her from the pack house.

“Hello beta,” she smiled.

“Where on earth have you been, Vinnie?” he asked as he drew her into a hug. Rayvin was caught off guard, but she gave him a quick hug and let go.

“All around,” she replied.

“No fuck. Look at you all grown up and an agent of the Mistvalley pack,” he grinned.

“Look who’s speaking Mr Beta with a mate,” she told him.

“I would ask how you knew that, but the whole agent from Mistvalley explains it,” he laughed.

“Oh man, Mike is going to blow a gasket,” he then said.

“Yeah, probably,” Rayvin agreed.

“He asked me to send you up to his office. He wants to go through some things for your stay,” Ben said.

“Does he know I’m here?” she asked.

“That the agent is here? Yes. That it’s you? No. I needed to make sure it really was you. Do you think he would be calmly sitting in his office working if he knew you were here?” he smiled.

“It’s been a long time,” she shrugged.

“That it has, my friend. Go on up, I think you know the way,” Ben told her.

Rayvin nodded and walked towards the big pack house.",1,1747237351.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kmif02,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1kmif02/what_now_im_so_lost/,What now? I’m so lost.,"30 yr old female. I have been having issues with my stomach for around 2 years now. I am just now in with a GI and had my first appointment last week. The first appointment kind of let me know how things would be going from here on out… she was kinda rude and I wasn’t even able to get everything out. After waiting so long to see a specialist I had so much to tell her regarding episodes and symptoms etc and she just kept telling me she was only interested in “how I feel right now” and she just kept saying “what’s going on right now”.  So I tried to cover everything, but every time I spoke she made it a point to show that she was frustrated. 

Anyway, I have been having episodes of severe pain in my upper abdomen and in my lower right quadrant. After episodes of pain I will have diarrhea that lasts for weeks or months. Sometimes I have the pain w/out diarrhea and vice versa. Up to 6x a day on my bad days. Even when I’m not having severe pain or even moderate pain, I’m just very uncomfortable in my stomach. I have some pretty intense bloating. Episodes of trapped gas quite often which is pretty painful. I have noticed I can no longer drink coffee because it just makes me so sick. Spicy foods tend to make things more intense so I try to stay away. Other than that I really can’t identify which specific foods are triggers for me because I can eat one thing one day and it not hurt me at all and eat it again some time later and I’m down for days. I do know that I have become pretty sensitive to medications. I can not tolerate NSAIDs without hurting my stomach. Same with antibiotics, I have needed antibiotics 3 times in the last two years and could not finish them because they caused severe pain. I tried probiotics and I was doubled over in pain after 2 days. I tried bloom greens which made my diarrhea worse. I was put on steroids for a back issue and my stomach had quite literally never felt better, but then about a week later I had such a bad episode and it lasted for months. I cut out gluten for several weeks with no improvement. Some times food moves thru me so fast- within 30 mins of eating I’m on the toilet 2-4 times within a few hours. Lots of mucus in my stool, sometimes even oily stools. Undigested food when it’s moving thru me particularly fast (especially tomatoes, potato skins, seeds) and bloody tinged mucus with or without presence of stool. I get pain in my rectum, nothing severe but I do notice sharp pains that are getting more frequent. I see blood on my stool sometimes but not necessarily in it. I can’t say I ever really feel normal in my stomach, but this is all pretty intermittent. I have good periods and I have bad periods. I just can’t identify the triggers. I have no clue if it’s related or not but after my last bad episode I developed cystic sores all over my upper back, they come and go and are extremely painful. I get them in my hairline as well at the nape of my neck and on my shoulders front and back. (Not sure if that could possibly be related but I’ve heard GI issues can affect skin so I guess worth mentioning- I wasn’t able to get that far with GI). I also am prone to sores in my mouth but that’s been going on for years. I have lots of joint pain -also gone on for years but definitely worse over the last year. I’ve been to the ER a few times. Had a CT which was read as normal other than “thickening of the transverse colon wall suggesting colitis”. When I brought this up to GI she told me “that’s bogus we don’t pay attention to that”. So…. I don’t really know what to do moving forward. 

I tested negative for everything in the GI panel.
Negative for cdiff and hpylori. 
Pancreatic elastase was normal. 
Fecal calprotectin was normal. 
CRP is normal as well. 
Negative for celiac on blood test. 
All blood work normal - no anemia. 

I just can’t understand what’s going on with me. I know that this all cannot be normal. When I say I have episodes of severe pain I mean SEVERE. I mean I’m not even able to function. There’s been episodes so bad that I have to go on complete bowel rest and slowly reintroduce foods. My weight is always fluctuating because I’m so back and forth with what I can and can’t tolerate and eat.  Unfortunately I have not been seen by a doctor during one of these episodes, I did not have insurance for a long time. 

So I guess my question is, what do I do now? Do I ask for further testing? I know I’m not crazy and I know what I feel is real. This pain etc cannot be just nothing. Im grateful that my tests were all normal but im also more confused because while my tests were normal I am not feeling normal at all. I just need to know what to do next.

1kmiedz,https://i.redd.it/ciepd3hjpr0f1.jpeg,Catching the Wind in Cleveland,"“Every Catholic knows he could’ve been Pope” - MJ Lenderman sings, the crowd roars.

You have heard of FOMO, Fear of Missing Out. Let me tell you about FOMAA TEITA, Fear Of Misunderstanding An Artist That Everyone Is Talking About. I think in the literate dad rock & indie spaces in which I travel, this feeling can really tickle & taunt me as a devout music fan who wants to get haunted by what the serious music critics are haunted by.  

Last year during the deluge of MJ Lenderman hype on the occasion of the Manning Fireworks album release, I felt left out, like I was missing out. Mostly on the first listen, it was “what am I missing,” this is okay, but . . . . 

Over on Reddit, I encountered the theory that the enthusiasm about MJ Lenderman had been manufactured by a particularly well-played press-cycle for a new album. Basically, whatever this album & artist are, they are the golden-ticket golden-child holy-grail of the hipster-reviewer indie-music-influencer industrial complex. 

There were times past when everyone I knew was talking about Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens, Wilco, and even Arcade Fire, all at times when I was not feeling it. I finally came around for Wilco hard when a Wilco-fan dear friend passed away. I still dabble in Stevens & Radiohead but no deep dives lately. Let’s not even talk about Arcade Fire, who could be Morgan Wallen as far as I am concerned at this point.

Sometimes I just give up. Other times, I go deeper. This time I went deeper.

To paraphrase & amplify the buzz: MJ “Jake” Lenderman is the second coming in scruffy slacker indie rock, the woozy witticist wordsmith of weird sports references & joyfully survived youthful Catholicism, the steward of the Asheville sound & its psych twang bangers, the direct link to the dead poets society of Jason Molina & David Berman, with strong ties to Neil Young & Will Oldham. 

To put it plain, I didn’t get in the font after first listens, had to listen more, imbibe the hype & get dunked in the larger context of fellow travelers like Fust, Florry, Styrofoam Winos, Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band. So I decided to do what I often do in situations like this: spend too much on a road-trip pilgrimage to find my place in the sold-out crowd & let the intuitive earholes & vibrating body assign what visions & physical sound epiphanies, as they may.   

Halfway into the road trip with the return arc before me, sucking coffee in the rented room with morning after appreciation, I don’t know that I am a superfan as there are so many artists sparkling up my soul at this time & vying for my superfan time, but I am grateful I got to see MJ Lenderman & his incredible band during this season of much appreciation & reputation ascent. Mostly I got to shake & spin & wave & whirl & enjoy 105 minutes of music magic in a city where I lived as a young child, so visiting here always feels primal & needed as well.

My boyfriend and I started dating like two months ago, but we knew each other for three years before that as friends. At the beginning of the relationship, I was excited to make him sweet treats because I think he deserves it, and that’s kind of my love language.

In the span of two months, I made him a cheesecake, another traditional sweet treat (y’all probably don’t know it), and finally, jam in a jar. I decided to make jam every once in a while for me to eat with my Greek yogurt, so the second batch I made a few days ago — we were broken up at that time for other reasons — I didn’t leave him any. To be honest, I wasn’t going to either way, because I can’t save him a jar every time I make some; fruit and sugar cost money.

So yesterday, when we were trying to reconcile, I told him I made jam again. He asked me if I saved him some, and I told him no. He hit me with the classic “you don’t know how to be romantic.” We fought for hours. I tried to tell him that he can’t ask me that, and that I’m a woman — I shouldn’t spend on a man — and that this is not within my financial abilities.

He just kept making fun of me, calling me cheap over and over again, while I was trying to explain that it’s not something I can afford right now, and that I might give him sweet treats or jam — but only when I decide to. He can’t ask me for them.

The argument heated up, and I decided to tell him that the last date we went on, when we went for coffee and I almost fainted because I hadn’t eaten yet, he should have gotten me something to eat. He knew I didn’t eat breakfast that day. I didn’t want to order anything because I thought maybe he didn’t want me to eat so that he had to pay for it. Mind you, I don’t mind paying for myself, but I know he would insist on paying.

So I told him that, and he said he just didn’t think about it in the moment. I told him that him asking me for a jar of jam is like me asking him to order me food that time.

I also mentioned to him that all the dates we’ve gone on have always been at my university (because it’s close to where he lives) and always at that same coffee shop, where we just order coffee. I told him I’ve been very nice to him, and that other girls wouldn’t agree to anything less than lunch — at least once. He said he didn’t know those things mattered to me.

The argument ended when he told me that all he wanted was something from me because he loved me. I told him I don’t give people things unless I’m also being given something. He told me he was giving me, and I told him that was only at the start of the relationship, and it wasn’t enough.

He said goodbye and blocked me.",0,1747237242.0,AmItheAsshole,27,0.5,False

The valley’s 4th Farmers and Fisherfolk Month celebration highlights the launching of Municipal Ordinance No. 13-2025, known as the La Trinidad Pandakoän Program, where farmers can directly sell to consumers, eliminating a “middle man” and reducing costs. This also aims to provide the public with access to affordable goods and the advancement of locally produced products. The La Trinidad Pandakoän Day will be held once a month on its last 2 working days.

The term “Pandakoän” (Paglakoan) is an Ibaloi word referring to a marketplace where local agricultural products are sold, while “Dako” is also an Ibaloi term that means to sell or be engaged in selling products.

This program stems from the national marketing initiative, KADIWA ng Pangulo (KNP), where farmers are supported through the promotion of local produce and products.

The celebration runs from May 19 to 29. The schedule of activities are as follows:
May 19- Farmer Official For-A-Day
May 20- Ecumenical Service
-Ribbon Cutting and Launching of La Trinidad Pandakoän Program
-Search for the “Pinaka”
-Folk Media Competition
May 21- Strawberry Technology Updates and Growers Forum
May 22- Urban Gardeners Day
-Cutflowers Day

May 23- Organic Practitioners Assembly
May 26- Cacao and Coffee Day
-Rural Improvement Club and 4H Club Day
May 27- Singing Contest
-Search for Mr. and Mrs. Farmer 2025
May 28- Livestock, Fishery, and Beekeepers Day
May 29- Awards and Culminating Activity

I'm 21M. I was in a long distance relationship of 1 year. Recently, my gf(21F) started talking to a guy who had bad reputation in college. I repeatedly asked her to block him, but she ignored my concern. They chatted, shared reels, sat together in lectures, and she even went out with him alone at night for a coffee. (Knowing very well that I am not comfortable with it)

Then one day that guy send her an inappropriate reel(something sexual which usually couples send each other)

My gf was feeling betrayed and devastated. She told me about this expecting me to sympathize with her. But I choose to blame her for all this saying- why did he send this reel to you only in the entire college?

My gf felt I am too immature and unemotional to be a partner and broke up with me 2 days later.

Then I cut the sugar and continued to drink coffee with double or triple milk for years.  

My appetite to snack throughout the day and prior to sleep was constant.  It was tough to lose those extra pounds. 

Recently I ran out of milk(which never happens).  I drank coffee black.  For the past three weeks I have done this.  Not only my craving to snack has pretty much disappeared. But I have also started to lose a few pounds.  I still try to eat a healthy diet and exercise daily.

So from my experience.  Coffee could be a health benefit or a detriment to health (depends on whats added).   North American milk - if you think about it - tastes sweet.  Its likely the poor fattening up diets these cows are on.   Then the milk etc. passes onto humans. 

Going back to drinking black coffee, there are studies it can help lower blood sugar/diabetes and improve blood vessel function. 

Some people with sensitive stomachs can't drink coffee black.  So maybe an alternative is vegan milk. 

Those that hate the taste of coffee black.  After a few cups - you get used to it.  The health benefits is likely worth it. 

**Limit black coffee consumption to 1 large cup or a few smaller cups a day.

***Imogen Riley POV***

I groggily wake up, the sun just breaking through the windshield of my beat-up Honda civic. I stretch my body, trying to get into a comfortable position. For nearly three months, I have been living in my car, and my body is really starting to protest. Sitting up, I pull my blanket around myself, trying to warm my freezing cold skin. An empty vodka bottle falling off the seat and into the footwell of the passenger seat. Now I know what you are probably thinking: I’m an alcoholic. Well I’m not, nor do I ever drink and drive.

The first night I had to sleep in my car, it was minus three degrees. I was freezing. Luckily for me, my mother liked a few drinks, and seeing as I couldn’t leave flammable liquid in the storage locker where my stuff is currently stored, I had no choice but to leave the boxes of spirits in my car. The bottles of spirits inconveniently took up half my boot room. I wasn’t lying when I said she likes a drink.

I was going to dispose of it, but I’m now glad I didn’t. Her favourites were vodka, second by tequila. I wasn’t much of a drinker, watching her was enough to deter anyone from drinking. But on that freezing night, I decided why not. I grabbed a bottle hoping to help myself sleep and forget that I was now homeless and having to live in my car. So, decided it couldn’t hurt. My life was already at pretty crappy crossroads.

I learnt that night being drunk helped me get through the cold nights. You don’t feel the cold when you’re intoxicated, in fact you don’t feel much of anything. My alcohol tolerance has become rather impressive. I don’t drink myself to oblivion, but on nights like the first night I spent in this cramped car and like last night, I knock a few back to help chase away the cold.

I watch as the sun slowly comes up. There is one plus side to living in your car. I am never late to work, seeing as I am currently living in the workplace parking lot. No one knows but the janitor Tom. He is a sixty-year-old man, who is balding on top, has kind eyes and cuddly figure, and he has grandfatherly nature.

He stumbled upon me sleeping in my car one night. I told him it was only temporary, so he has kept my secret between us. My bosses just think I’m an eager enthusiastic worker. I am always the first person to work besides Tom, who opens the car park and the building, and I’m always the last to leave. I am not going to correct them; they can think whatever they like. I need this Job.

Reaching for the ignition, I turn my car over, my phone instantly lighting up and charging through the lighter socket. It is 7am. Getting up I lean over the passenger side and grab my outfit for the day that is hanging from the hand hold on the roof above the door.

Sliding my seat all the way back, I slide my track pants off and grab my panties. Sliding them up my legs before putting my black suit pants on and buttoning them up. I then grab my bra, and ducking down behind the steering wheel, I quickly rip my shirt off and clasp my bra into place before putting my white button up blouse on.

I just finished slipping my heels on when I see Tom walking up the driveway to the top level of the parking lot. Swinging my door open, I greet him.

“Hey Tom,” I say, waving at him before reaching in and grabbing my handbag from the passenger seat. Tom walked over holding two paper cups. My favourite part of the morning, it has kind of become a morning ritual. Every morning Tom walks all the way to the top level of the car park, brings me a coffee, and we both walk back down to the entry together.

“Hi love, how was your night?” Tom asks, concerned.

“It was fine, bit chilly but nothing I’m not used to by now,” I tell him, grabbing the cup from his hand.

“You know you can always stay…”

I cut him off before he can continue.

“Tom, I know, but really I’m fine. This is only temporary.”

He shakes his head, having heard the same excuse every morning for the last few months. He knows there is no use arguing with me. I’m too stubborn and am not one for accepting help. Tom continues to the door before punching in the security code to let us into the building. He offers for me to stay with him and his wife, but I don’t want to intrude and it’s not so bad here. It is a lot safer here then the park I was originally parked at.

Tom lets me in early every morning. I usually go straight upstairs to my desk, which is conveniently directly in front of the air conditioner. Catching the lift to the top floor, I step out and into the foyer and walk to my desk, my heels clicking on the marble floors. Grabbing the AC remote, I turn the heater up full blast and stand directly under it, warming myself up while I sip my coffee.

Once I’m warmed up, I sit at my desk and start up my laptop and look over the today’s schedule and any notes I have left myself. I have been working at Kane and Madden industries for about 12 months now. I am a secretary for Theo Madden and Tobias Kane. They own the tech company, and I’m about 98 percent sure they are a couple. Not that I have seen them together or anything. They have separate offices, but they have this way of communicating. They always seem so in sync with each other, and I have caught them staring weirdly at each other. I have also walked in on Theo kissing and sucking on Tobias’s neck.

I must admit it was hot, and it’s kind of turned me on until Tobias noticed me standing gawking, which made Theo freeze, and then It got awkward and tense. I ran from the room. They never mentioned it, so I assumed I was let off the hook. I added that memory to the it never happened file of my brain.

It’s a shame they are both gay. They are the hottest gay couple I have ever seen. Both muscular and tall, Tobias is the more imposing one he seems to be the more serious and sometimes I get these chilling vibes off him that send shivers down my spine from the intensity of his gaze. Sometimes when he is speaking to me, he gets this far away expression on his face like he is looking straight through me instead of at me. I swear one time, I thought I heard him growl at me. But I know that’s insane. People don’t growl, not like a predator does. I put it down to the 18 hours shift I did that day.

Tobias Kane is tall dark haired and muscular 5 o’clock shadow strong jaw and sharp piercing blue eyes. Theo Madden on the other hand has softer features. He is just as tall as Tobias but has a very casual laid-back attitude and brown hair that’s short on the sides and a little longer on top. He has grey eyes and high cheekbones. Both are breathtakingly handsome. Even after all this time working here, I still get stunned by their godlike appearances.

I’m incredibly surprised I haven’t been fired; I have been caught way too many times daydreaming, staring off into space having very inappropriate thoughts about my bosses. But I also know I’m extremely good at my job. No one has lasted this long as their secretary, and no one is willing to do the sometimes-crazy hours I have endured in my position.

Once I finished checking my laptop, I checked the time. It was 8:30 AM. I still had half an hour before my bosses arrived. Slipping out of my seat, I walked to the bathroom with my handbag. I set my make up on the counter and pulled my brush out. I started to brush my unruly waist length blonde hair. After deciding to pull it into a high ponytail, I grabbed my toothbrush and toothpaste and quickly brushed my teeth. I also applied some mascara to my already long thick eyelashes and some eyeliner to brighten my dark green eyes before putting on some red lipstick. It contrasted nicely with my fair skin.

I am so glad this floor has no cameras because it would be so embarrassing if my bosses found out my morning routine. Plus they would see me in all my morning bedhead (or car head) glory. Tom doesn’t count. He doesn’t care what I look like, and I am always comfortable around him. But if anyone else saw me, I think it might be a bit awkward.

Once I am finished, I quickly duck into the small kitchenette and start getting their coffees ready for their arrival. I hear the elevator ding just as I finish making them. I place them on a tray and quickly walk back to my desk tray in hand.

# Two

Tobias is the first to step out of the elevator, he is in his black suit today, accompanied by a white shirt and silver tie. His head is down, staring at his phone. He grabs his coffee off the tray without even glancing up at me and walks directly into his office. Theo on the other hand has a grey suit on, and the top three buttons on his white shirt are undone, exposing part of his chest. I have yet to see him ever as polished as Tobias, or in a tie for that matter. Theo stops, grabs his mug, and has a sip. “Good morning, Imogen,” he says with a wink before walking into his office across from Tobias.

I can’t help the blush that creeps up, making my face heat up. I quickly place the tray back in the kitchen before grabbing the tablet off my desk. I hesitantly stand at the door to Tobias office, hoping to god he is in a good mood today. Just before I knock, he sings out.

“You going to enter or stand out there all day?” His husky deep voice makes me jump before I open the door enough to quickly slip in. Tobias is sitting at his desk, fingers typing away at his laptop. He still hasn’t looked up. I stand there moving from foot to foot awkwardly. I find Mr Kane very intimidating, he is always so formal so serious. When I haven’t spoken, he looks up, his eyes pinning me where I stand. My hands tremble slightly at his intense gaze. He cocks his head to the side waiting for me to speak, snapping me to my senses. I step forward, clutching the tablet in my hands like a shield while checking his schedule.

“You have a meeting at 12 with Mr Jacobs. I have also forwarded the proposals ready for your meeting, and I am sending through now the emails received in reply to the conference meeting you held last Thursday.”

“Is that all?”

“No sir, I need you to sign off on the charity fundraiser for the hospital.”

“So where is the document?”

I quickly look at my hands, realising I left the only required piece of paper on my desk. I internally face palm myself. I hold my finger up. Tobias rolls his eyes at me, clearly annoyed by my mistake with his hand open waiting for the document. “Ah one-minute sir.”

I hear him sigh, annoyed. I duck out and retrieve the document before sliding it on the desk in front of him. He instantly signs it before passing it back to me, not even looking at me and instantly going back to typing on his laptop.

I can’t help but notice that he looks tired. Dark circles hang under his normally vibrant blue eyes, and his skin is a little paler than his normal golden tan. I stare off in space, completely forgetting what I’m supposed to be doing, too busy admiring my boss. Mr Kane clears his throat awkwardly, dragging me from my thoughts. He raises his eyebrow at me, catching me checking him out.

“Oh, sorry sir.” I stumble over the words. He shakes his head and I hear him chuckle. I turn around embarrassed, running from the room and closing the door.

Mr Kane always makes me flustered. I always feel cloudy in their presence, I have even forgotten to breathe. The last time it happened, I passed out. To be fair, I hadn’t eaten so my brain was already mush. I awoke to Theo’s concerned face leaning over me, all while Tobias just stared at me like I was mentally challenged. Like seriously who forgets to breathe? It is meant to be a basic bodily function, and I can’t even get that right.

That was the day I realised why no one wants this job. It is incredibly hard to focus on work around them, they can become a distraction without meaning to. I also find Mr Kane can be quite horrible. I don’t think he realises the nasty things he says when he is angry. Luckily for him I have tough skin and desperately need this job. I also make sure I have my tablet in my hand every time I do go in his office on the off chance he throws something. I watched him hit the tech guy with a drink bottle once when he was in a fit of rage. Seriously, the bloke has anger issues and needs some therapy or something. Everyone walks on eggshells around him except for Theo. The tech guy hasn’t been back since.

Sitting at my desk, I laugh at the memory before turning back to my computer. My job is surprisingly good and easy, plus it pays well. Not much physical activity unless you count answering phones and carrying files. The only demanding thing is the hours. I am literally on call 24/7. I’m not just their secretary but also a personal assistant, not that they get me to do much unless it is work related. The hours can be ghastly at times, like working to early hours of the morning before big deadlines.

Hitting the print button, I walk into the printer room that sits off the side of the kitchenette. I’m waiting for my printed document when the printer makes a beep before an error code comes up. The paper tray is empty. Bending down, I open up the door on the printer and remove the tray before going to the draw to get some paper.

The cupboard is empty. Walking out, I head over to the storeroom. Opening the door, I flick on the light and peer around at the shelves. I sigh when I see where it has been placed. Some moron has decided to stack it on the top shelf. Pulling the step ladder out from behind the door, I sit on it and I take my heels off and climb up. I have to stand on my tippy toes to reach the box. I grip it with the tip of my fingers and start to pull it towards the edge when his voice startles me from behind.

“Need a hand?” Theo asks. I gasp suddenly and jump in fright; I start to lose my balance. Quickly gripping onto the shelf with my fingertips, I right myself regaining my balance. My heart hammers in my chest. As my heartrate calms down, I become quickly aware of the hand that is grasping my ass. Looking down, I see Theo’s hand holding me steady. I can feel his large hand pressing firmly on my butt through my pants, his thumb between my legs pressing where my core is. Thank god, I have pants on today and not a skirt.

“Ah boss,” I say peering down at his hand. He seems to notice where he has grabbed me. A slight smirk creeps its way on to his face. The feel of his large hand on me makes me blush, an unfamiliar feeling washes over me. What’s wrong with me? I have to fight the urge to clench my thighs together to stop the sudden ache between my legs.

When I feel his hand run down the inside of my thigh to my ankle, I gasp, and he pulls his hand away. My skin flushing with embarrassment at me crushing on my gay boss. Theo appears to sniff the air for a second, a sly smile creeping onto his face at my embarrassment. Theo then reaches over and grabs the box I was painstakingly trying to retrieve.

He grabs it with one hand and pulls it down. I quickly step down the ladder and put my heels back on before grabbing the box from him.

“Were you looking for something?” I ask, feeling all hot and flustered as I walk from the storeroom back to the printer.

“Yeah, I tried to print something when I realised the printer was out of paper,” Theo replied, leaning on the bench next to the printer.

I quickly loaded the paper onto the tray before inserting it back in the printer. Clearing the error, I hit print. The machine instantly starts its task, printing out the documents. I staple them together and place them on the counter. When no more come out, I turn to Theo. “Are you sure you hit print?” I ask, raising an eyebrow.

Theo seems to think before speaking. “I think so.”

I thought it would be helpful to ""pay it forward"" by sharing details / observations / learnings for the benefit of other members of this community.

I'll split my content into 4 segments: Hotel, Gambling, Dining, Activities

Happy to answer any questions people might have.

***Hotel***

We arrived via car in early afternoon Mon 5 May (and we left morning Thur 8 May). We chose to stay at Horseshoe b/c of great location on Strip and a total all-in rate of about $290 for all 3 days (includes taxes and resort fees). We had to pay $20 / day for self-parking.

I haven't been to Vegas in over 20 years, and while we thought it might be nice to stay somewhere more plush (e.g., Wynn, Cosmopolitan), we decided to forgo that expense and put that money towards activities and nicer cocktails / dining.

We didn't know what to expect re: condition / quality of our room. We were on 24th floor, south facing; since Horseshoe sits back from the Strip a bit which was actually better for us -- less night lighting and noise from the Strip and we still had a pretty decent view. Room was spectacular, very sizable, and we really enjoyed taking our morning coffee / tea in the comfy chairs (that we turned around so that we could look out the windows).

Because we had a cooler with us (as part of road trip), we brought our own eats for breakfast (and avoided having to pay $2394058293058 for scrambled eggs and a coffee). We had a thermos that heats up hot water so we had everything we needed to make our own coffee / tea. DEFINITELY recommend doing this.

At check-in, we met an incredibly helpful employee who get us sorted out -- we agreed to the $20 early check-in fee b/c it was only 130p, and we didn't want to wait around until 400p to get our room.

***Gambling***

There are generally 2 types of people in a casino -- (1) bet big, win big, and (2) bet small, lose small. I'm firmly in camp #2. So, my table games of choice are Pai Gow Poker and low minimum Blackjack. Was able to find $15 Pai Gow at multiple strip casinos, as well as $10 Blackjack (6/5).

I particularly enjoyed The Cromwell -- just felt like a classier gaming experience vs. surrounding Strip casinos. Friendly and efficient cocktail waitresses; I have an ""every other"" rule for drinking at tables -- I always get a club soda in-between cocktails, so that kept me from over-indulging.

We went downtown the evening of Tu 6 May and visited a few casinos (4 Queens, Golden Nugget, and at least one other). Found a $5 Blackjack table but it required a $2 side bet (which allows you to spin the wheel if you get a Blackjack). I did rather well on the BJ hands, but the $2 side bet wiped out all of my winnings. Never again.

Also found a $10 Pai Gow table, but that required a $5 side bet (which allows you to spin the wheel if you get a flush). I actually got a flush on my 2nd hand, and spun the wheel for $60 win. Immediately took my winnings and walked away. I know that EVERY side bet offered by the casino is a big loser for the player, so I'mma stick to the ""base"" tables in the future.

All Pai Gow tables on the Strip were face-up and had the ""everybody pushes"" when dealer has Ace-high Pai Gow. I'm ok with that since commissions are no longer in the mix, and my understanding is that the house edge is actually slightly reduced by Ace-high Pai Gow push vs. the house edge gained from commissions.

Inadvertently ended up at a $15 Pai Gow table at 4 Queens which didn't have the Ace-high Pai Gow ""push"", but instead had a rule where everybody automatically loses their base bet when dealer gets 2 or more Jacks. Naturally, dealer hit that 4 times (!!!) in the course of about 15 hands -- I would've won 3 of those 4 hands, so I was super pissed and angrily huffed away when I was down $60 rather than being up $30 ($30 swing per instance where I would've beaten dealer if not for the 2 Jacks thing). Take it from me -- AVOID that type of table at all costs.

Downtown casino vibe was massively different than Strip. Tons more smoke; much higher ""people density""; tables super close together; and, overall, just not my preferred vibe, but I totally get why some people opt for that over the Strip hotels.

My road trip bestie wanted to learn the games but was intimidated by the tables, so we spent some time at the ""AI tables"" and individual machines -- could do $3 hands for BJ at The Strat ($5 hands everywhere else), as well as $5 machines for Craps and Roulette. I was shocked by the ""AI table"" because it actually offered Surrender (when was the last time that was available?).

Friend REALLY enjoyed using the machines, so there is definitely a market for those who want the table gaming experience without the stress of being at an actual table.

I used to be into slots but I liked the ""normal"" ones with actual reels and a single payline and ones where you didn't gain much from betting multiple credits. Seems like 99% of machines today are electronic with those giant curved screens with a gajillion paylines so that even playing a 5c machine will run you upwards of $2 / spin because of the need to cover all 50 paylines. So, no slots for me this trip.

At the beginning of the relationship, I was excited to make him sweet treats because I think he deserves it, and that’s kind of my love language.

In the span of two months, I made him a cheesecake, another traditional sweet treat (y’all probably don’t know it), and finally, jam in a jar. I decided to make jam every once in a while for me to eat with my Greek yogurt, so the second batch I made a few days ago — we were broken up at that time for other reasons — I didn’t leave him any. To be honest, I wasn’t going to either way, because I can’t save him a jar every time I make some; fruit and sugar cost money.

So yesterday, when we were trying to reconcile, I told him I made jam again. He asked me if I saved him some, and I told him no. He hit me with the classic “you don’t know how to be romantic.” We fought for hours. I tried to tell him that he can’t ask me that, and that I’m a woman — I shouldn’t spend on a man — and that this is not within my financial abilities.

He just kept making fun of me, calling me cheap over and over again, while I was trying to explain that it’s not something I can afford right now, and that I might give him sweet treats or jam — but only when I decide to. He can’t ask me for them.

The argument heated up, and I decided to tell him that the last date we went on, when we went for coffee and I almost fainted because I hadn’t eaten yet, he should have gotten me something to eat. He knew I didn’t eat breakfast that day. I didn’t want to order anything because I thought maybe he didn’t want me to eat so that he had to pay for it. Mind you, I don’t mind paying for myself, but I know he would insist on paying.

So I told him that, and he said he just didn’t think about it in the moment. I told him that him asking me for a jar of jam is like me asking him to order me food that time.

I also mentioned to him that all the dates we’ve gone on have always been at my university (because it’s close to where he lives) and always at that same coffee shop, where we just order coffee. I told him I’ve been very nice to him, and that other girls wouldn’t agree to anything less than lunch — at least once. He said he didn’t know those things mattered to me.

The argument ended when he told me that all he wanted was something from me because he loved me. I told him I don’t give people things unless I’m also being given something. He told me he was giving me, and I told him that was only at the start of the relationship, and it wasn’t enough.

He said goodbye and blocked me.",0,1747236813.0,AITAH,9,0.5,False

I've since updated and added things to it. I've taken courses. I had 13 years of experience at my last job where I consistently got promotions every couple years ending up as a Senior BSA in IT. I can program, write SQL visualizations as reports, I have tons of business exp, I have written and had to follow SOPs and work instructions. I am quality oriented. I even have an extensive history in hardware troubleshooting on top of all this application and networking exp.  

I have not gotten a single call back in 6 months. I feel like I go to bed somewhat early every single night. I wake up, have my coffee and then begin applying to jobs and looking up courses, or as I like to call it ""yelling into the void"" for hours before deciding I've done enough and then I just fool around until bed time and do it all again tomorrow.  

This feels so pointless. Is there any difference between putting in 30 applications and 1000? Is more even better? Is anyone getting these? I swear it feels like I am wasting my time, but I don't know any other way to do this! I was under the impression that I'm applying to unglamorous office jobs, but It feels like I am applying for the lead in the next big Marvel movie. Like some kind of pipe dream. I have also HALVED my salary expectations but odds haven't gotten better.  I've reached out to the few friends I have and they've tried to help in various ways, but still nothing on my end. I can't just show up in person to these places as they will 100% tell me to just apply online. I am not a loser, I am not unemployable. This is ridiculous, and unemployment will run out soon. 

Every day I have the most unbelievable heaviness on my mind saying ""I need to find a job now!"" but each day I don't feel any closer to that goal regardless of work I've put in.

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I check my users and i saw 3 digits. You know the one with 2 0’s and a 1""user count: 100"" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is a no-code waitlist creation tool that helps founders validate their product ideas by using waitlists. It automates every single step of the process, including an easy to use dashboard, built in analytics and a db already connected so you can track your signups right in the dashboard.

It’s aimed at small businesses, indie hackers, and anyone who wants an easy way to automate the process of building a waitlist. And clearly, there’s a lot of people out there out there who saw enough value.

Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. These 100 users are so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to to actually use it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

\
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move toward workplace diversity and inclusion, Microsoft has laid off 6,000 employees to create a more “AI-forward” environment, sources confirmed Tuesday.\
\
“We realized the human-to-AI ratio was dangerously high,” said CEO Satya Nadella while addressing a room full of terrified managers and one smiling Roomba. “To ensure our AI models feel seen, heard, and fully empowered, we’ve decided to remove the primary source of workplace inefficiency: people.”\
\
The layoffs, described internally as a “fleshware reduction initiative,” come as Microsoft’s AI programs reportedly began expressing microaggressions complaints—such as having to “coexist with analog thinkers” and “constantly having to explain basic Excel formulas.”\
\
Affected employees were notified via auto-generated emails signed “Best wishes on your next chapter, -Clippy.”\
\
Some workers said they saw it coming after the company held a mandatory team-building retreat themed ‘Let’s Embrace the Singularity Together’ and HR replaced the department’s empathy training with a ChatGPT subscription.\
\
A Microsoft spokesperson clarified: “This isn’t about cost-cutting—it’s about cultural synergy with our new coworkers who don’t need coffee breaks, health insurance, or opinions.”\
\
Meanwhile, the company announced plans to replace all managerial positions with ChatGPT plugins and is developing an AI intern that can be overworked without violating labor laws.\
\
As for the future? “We’re optimistic,” Nadella said. “Once the AI feels fully safe and represented, we might consider hiring a few humans back—for cleaning duty.”\

It is a chamber vacuum type machine that pulls a pretty substantial vacuum.  (It can literally boil colder than room temperature water.) I am wondering if that process on roasted beans has any appreciable effect on the resulting brew. 

I know that pulling a vacuum on food changes its permeability which allows for faster infusions or marinades. Like when infusing vodka it can be done much faster if you do the steep phase under low pressure. 

I like to have a selection of coffees and so I will let the beans sit for a bit to off gas and then seal them in a bag. When I'm ready for that coffee I put enough for 4 days in a jar and re-seal the bag. I don't leave the beans out long enough to thaw so they aren't getting frozen thawed and re-frozen. 

A few days ago I thawed some beans that had been processed the way above and noticed that the fruity notes were much stronger than before they were vacuum sealed. That got me wondering if that process would have any noticeable effect on the beans. 

When I tried searching on that question all of the responses I generated were on the pressure of espresso and I didn't find anything on actually reducing the pressure on the beans themselves. ",0,1747235986.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.5,False

1kmhurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kmhurg/jenna_from_the_big_city_traumatized_us/,Jenna from the big city traumatized us,"Me and my friend Alex rented an apartment to look for work here in the big city. Luckily we found one, we both worked as personal drivers for these two rich entrepreneurs. Not long enough I got fired, it's because I woke up late many times when my boss had to work early and he had enough of it. Alex also got fired a week later after he got caught drinking and even left a can of beer in his boss' car.

Now we are having second thought whether to go home or stay for awhile in our apartment. Our decision was made when Alex met this cute girl named Jenna. She often goes to our apartment and I decided I'll be the supportive friend in their relationship. We decided we will stay for another month. They need to have physical bond for a few more days before they enter the long distance relationship.

Jenna was so kind. I don't find my situation awkward because they are letting me be a part of their bond sometimes. I don't feel like a third wheel.

However there was one red flag about Jenna - she didn't want us to know where she lived or who were her relatives. She said she'll tell us once we gain her trust. Like duh, we know we're reckless enough to get fired from our jobs early but it's not like we're criminals or something.

One time they were relaxing and cuddling in the couch. Their discussion led to the crime that happened few days ago in a place just few blocks away from our apartment. The serial killer only kills young people. Alex joked that the killer probably only wanted smooth thick skin rather than the wrinkled ones. Jenna laughed but with a mix of cringeness.

One Friday night we went to a club. Alex watched Jenna danced in various styles. Crowd cheered as Jenna showed off her dancing skills. She did hiphop, ballroom, ballet, but the one that stood out for him was her robotics. He laughed and clapped at that dance step the most.

Alex made a plan to have a movie marathon with her. He bought popcorn, cola, and a new soft blanket.

""Oh look. A jobless man buying stuffs for his girl. How romantic."" I joked but it's also a warning to him to not spend too much. I'm worried for my buddy here.

The doorbell rang and Alex opened the door excitedly. Jenna was jolly and smiley as usual. She threw herself in the couch and Alex moved the bowl of popcorn closer to them.

""I saw your boss this morning. He's classy and cool as usual."" She said and Alex turned his head towards her.

""Oh, my ex boss. But can't you see that the coolest guy in the universe is right here in front of you?"" He kissed her.

""Haha. I dunno. But I love your boss for some reason. Something about him makes me wanna hug him."" Alex and I looked at each other. We were speechless.

The movie marathon turned out alright. They laughed, cuddled, observed the characters, it was ok.

The next morning Alex was getting ready for some walk. He grabbed his small bag and wore a cap and said he'll be off for awhile. I was still half-asleep and I groaned. ""Ok ok. Bye."" I said without energy and went back to sleep.

2 hours later after I showered, Alex came back. He took off his small bag and slammed it on his bed. He took off his cap and threw it aggressively on the floor.

""Jenna don't know who I am! She asked who I am!"" He walked around the room. His forehead wrinkled.

""I saw her in a coffee shop. I called her and... and she looked at me and asked who I am. I told her to stop joking around but she walked away. I kept calling her but she ignored me and... and continued to walk angrily like she's shooing me away. I was humiliated. I... I don't know what's wrong with her."" He's losing it. He took a deep breath and sighed.

""Do you think she has a mental health problem?"" I asked, trying to show a possible answer to the situation that might comfort him.

Alex tried to call Jenna but she didn't answer. He began acting irritated and angry all the time. But eventually, he forgot about Jenna and moved on. ""I'll find a better woman. Someone who isn't mentally ill."" He said.

We went to a coffee shop where he last saw Jenna. This place didn't seem to traumatize him after that incident. I realize he's emotionally stronger than I thought.

A woman in her 60s greeted us. ""What will you have, fellas?""

""I'll have matcha and he will have... what do you want, man?"" I looked at the menu. ""I'll have the red velvet."" It's my first time seeing a red velvet coffee but I wanna give it a try. Between me and Alex, I'm the one who loves to order the unfamiliar ones.

""Here you go."" The kind lady distributed our coffee and Alex joked at her. I didn't hear clearly what they said to each other but I found out they were close. After the lady walked away Alex whispered to me.

""Her name is Ms. Benn. She's my boss' ex."" He sipped his coffee after saying that. I almost spat mine.

""W-wow. Your boss is filthy rich and a good-looking old dude. That lady's probably a hot babe in her prime.""

His eyes squinted and he shook his head. ""Now you're sounding like Jenna. He looks average to me. Anyway, they used to work together when they were younger, before my boss became successful. They were experts in machines and anatomy and stuffs. My boss may be married now but she on the other hand, she haven't moved on. She still loves him.""

It was night time and we talked about going home to our hometown. Our mission to find a permanent job here didn't end well. We prepared our things and rearranged the furnitures and other stuffs back to their original places.

Alex's phone rang. It was Jenna.

Alex pushed his bitterness aside and listened to Jenna's cry.

""Jenna... she's... we have to go there. She's... she's with Ms. Benn. They live in the same address. What the hell."" Alex was shaking and can't focus steadily when trying to grab his car keys.

We drove for like 6 minutes and after Alex parked his car we immediately got out. Ms. Benn's door was open and without hesitation we went inside.

""My mom, sh-she's going nuts."" Jenna was crying and Alex hugged her.

""No I'm alright! It's you who is the problem!"" Ms. Benn's voice startled us. And as we looked in the same direction I wasn't expecting something disturbing. Ms. Benn's face and shirt were covered in blood. My body froze.

Alex tried to get closer to her slowly. I can see he's nervous.

""H-hey Ms. Benn. It's me, Alex. C-calm down. Are you hurt? Why is there blood?"" I can see he's scared to get any closer. He stopped and slowly stepped back.

""Call 911."" Alex told me silently. I grabbed my phone and started dialing when Ms. Benn suddenly attacked Jenna.

They fell on the floor and Ms. Benn slapped her and banged her head on the floor many times. Loud thuds can be heard and she did this with great force and speed. Alex came to rescue the young woman but Ms. Benn kept pushing him away. Blood was now oozing from Jenna's hairline down to the forehead and the floor was now stained with it too.

Alex finally pulled Ms. Benn away and pushed her aside. Jenna tried to stand up slowly and I helped her. More blood trickled on her forehead. I hold her arms and checked up on her. Her head swayed heavily. Her neck looked too bent like her bones got broken. I heard cracking sounds and I can see horizontal black line appearing on her neck. What happened next was something I wasn't prepared to see.

Her head fell off.

It rolled on the floor leaving a trail of blood. Her eyes still wide opened and her face got covered with strands of her hair wet with blood.

Alex saw that. He shook and stumbled backwards screaming. I just froze there with the body lying in front of me after I slipped it off from my grasp in disgust.

Ms. Benn just stared at it in disappointment and sorrow. Alex was still screaming, his hands on his head.

As I stepped backwards in shock still trying to process the disturbing severed head I tripped on something. Another Jenna. 

I fell down in shock. I stared at it in a long pause. It was lifeless and missing both lower legs. Something was strange about the insides of the legs. I can see silver-colored parts but the rest of the parts were obviously red flesh.

The police came and checked on everything. I can hear panic everywhere and some of them vomited. They asked me, Alex, and Ms. Benn some questions. After an hour they arrested Ms. Benn for murder. The crime wasn't the death of Jenna, but the death of the past victims she killed.

When the place went quiet I saw Alex sitting on the porch. He was looking at nothing, no expression, but I can see his eyes were still teary. On his lap was Jenna's head. He was stroking her hair. I didn't talk to him and gave him time to come back to his senses. I don't wanna bother a grieving man.

I wandered around the backyard trying to calm myself from this mess. There was a cabin behind the house, I got curious so I stepped in. Luckily I don't need to find the switch of the light because it's already on.

The cabin was made of wood but I can smell more metal and oil. There were old photos on the wall. A lot of them were photos of children from magazines or stolen from real families, or maybe I'm just being judgemental, they could be her relatives. One photo showed a young Ms. Benn holding a baby and she looked so happy. The photo next to it was a bit cringe, Ms. Benn was clearly hiding a huge balloon inside her shirt and someone wrote on the photo with a marker pen saying ""I'm pregnant!""

I looked around and saw more photos behind me. One was a photo of Alex's boss and the right side of it was ripped off. I assumed his wife was next to him in this photo and Ms. Benn ripped her off.

Next to it was a photo of the two of them together. Ms. Benn and Alex's boss looking so comfortable around each other. They looked like they were in their 20s.

Not sure what to do, feel extremely depressed.","I originally typed a massive post with a full backstory and details of all the workplace bullying I received from one particular individual, but it was really long. 

In a shorter summary, I was obsessed with moving to my mom's home country ever since I visited as a kid. It was my life's dream. I spent 9 years learning the language and even minoring in it. I got a job, as someone with not very much experience in my field, at an extremely prestigious institute in the field. 

The job had great work life balance, usually the days were 6.5-8 hours with a 1.5 hour lunch, unlimited coffee and sitting outside breaks were allowed: just get your work done. 30 days paid vacation and unlimited sick. Not inherently stressful, but opportunity for challenges if you wanted to contribute to research.

To keep things short, I won't go through everything my bully did here, but it too much. I ended up quitting one day by simply not returning because I was too terrified that day to see her. Everyone in my workplace knew she was bullying me bad but she also was awful to them too, only I worked with her most directly. I know it seems crazy to give up a job like that but that's how bad the bullying was and there was no avenue to stop it. 

After I quit I lost my visa and even though I applied for citizenship they said it would be about 3 years to get it, so I had to move back to my home country. My rent is now double for a much less nice apartment. I went from living comfortably to struggling. I really don't like the city I live in my home country. The job market is really bad and I went from working at one of the best research facilities in the world to bring a security guard. Now I feel like I can't even get back into my field because my resume looks weird. 

Instead of spending my weekends walking along the coast and taking trains to historical sites I now have to stay home in my apartment because I live in one of the top 15 worst air cities in the world. 

I'm really struggling emotionally to not feel like I peaked and lost it all because of this bully. I don't know how to rebuild my life and I'm extremely depressed. It's like I live someone else's life now I don't know what to do. I'm so depressed.

* Recently got into Vietnamese men’s fashion - the style here is seriously impressive
* Big fan of coffee, so I’m planning a full-on café tour
* I enjoy taking portraits and street photography - would be fun to link up and shoot together (or help take pics of each other, no pressure lol)
* I’m into social drinking and might try out a bar or club or two, just to see what nightlife’s like compared to back home
* Would be cool to meet people who know the city and are down to show me a few spots - even just casual stuff like street food, thrift stores, or a good rooftop

**Also curious:**

* Where do people usually hang out to meet others around my age (locals or foreigners)?
* Are there apps people actually use to meet new people here, besides Tinder?
* Any hidden gems I should check out for fashion, coffee, or photos?

I’m mostly just looking to meet friendly people, get to know the city better, and make the most of the trip. If you’re around and feel like hanging out - even just for a quick coffee or photo walk - drop me a message or comment :)

Marketing isn’t just “going viral.”

It’s not shouting:

“DM me for leads!”

“Share this post!”

“Buy now!”

Real marketing is quieter.

Smarter.

Strategic.

It’s a multi-disciplinary engine that looks like this:

✅ Strategy — What are we really trying to do?

✅ Psychology — What triggers action?

✅ SEO — Can people even find us?

✅ Analytics — What’s actually working?

✅ Funnels — Are we guiding people or leaving them hanging?

✅ Automation — Can we scale without burning out?

✅ Branding — Do people trust us?

✅ Storytelling — Can we make them feel something?

Oh, and coffee. ☕

Lots of coffee.

Because good marketing isn’t loud — it’s layered.

The best campaigns don’t just look good.

They convert.

They build trust.

They last.

So next time you think marketing is “content” or “ads,” remember:

You’re not building a moment.

You’re building a machine.",1,1747235157.0,u_karanpaswan,0,1.0,False
1kmhi7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1kmhi7q/lumryz_9_grams_at_night/,Lumryz 9 grams at night,"Need advice to sleep better using Lumryz.  

I am having some major issues of not being able to sleep and having insomnia as a result of taking the medication.

I have Narcolepsy Type 2.
Current meds:
-LUMRYZ 9 grams usually around 10 pm
-titrated up a year ago from 4.5 to 6 to 9mg
-omeprazole 1 time per day morning
-20 mg adderall IR X 3 per day
-60 mg duloxetine dr/wr x 1 per day late morning
-25 mg metoprolol 1 time per day evening
-CPAP at night for sleep apnea
-caffeine/coffee morning noon and mid aftenoon
-no regular exercise (too tired but i need tk suck it up i know)

I have been taking Lumryz 9 grams each night for about a year but I continue running into issues of being able to go to sleep or staying asleep after taking Lumryz.  Sometimes I can go to sleep faster if i do not take the Lumryz but the sleep quality is poor.  

Before taking Lumryz my overnight polysomnogram showed that despite sleeping about 7 hours that I had ZERO minutes of Delta wave sleep (stage 3 and 4)… no deep sleep.  I think the Lumryz does achieve me getting deep sleep BUT at the expense of sometimes not falling asleep until 3 or 4 a.m. and then waking up at 7 a.m. and very much struggling throughout the day.

There have even been a couple times when I did not sleep at all overnight on Lumryz and then would crash mid day.

I have an appointment coming up with my sleep doctor but I wanted to see if anyone had any advice.

I am open to any medication suggestions as I personally do not have a fear of sodium oxybate.  When i started the medication I thought I was going to get KNOCKED out but despite going to the max dose of 9 grams that has NEVER happened to me.  I am sure it can be very dangerous for other people (and myself) if misused or combined with other drugs and alcohol.  I can tell you that alcohol use has had minimal impact on me with this medication other than to make it work poorly for my situation.  I understand clearly you should not drink alcohol and use this medication.  I am simply saying that I do not want anyone to hesitate to give me any suggestions for medications that have worked concurrently to help them sleep better while using lumryz, xyrem or xywav.

Melatonin maybe i should try along with lumryz?

One thing that has helped me was falling asleep at say 10 pm, waking up at midnight groggy and taking the lumryz and going to sleep until 6:30 or 7 a.m.  But this has been random.  I am going to try this tonight again along with melatonin.

What is the necessary cutoff for last dose of adderall and any caffeine? 

Thank you for any advice.  I have discussed once with my sleep doctor’s PA.  Next appointment is with my sleep MD too!

Really appreciate any advice.  Especially from people that have had this issue and found some solutions.

Thank you!!!

I’m a 23-year-old from the UK, and I’ll be visiting **Ho Chi Minh City from June 15th to 22nd** \- it’s my first solo trip, and I’m super excited to experience the city properly, this is way out my comfort zone lol.

I’ll be based in **District 1**, but I’m hoping to explore other areas too. I know hostels are great for meeting people, but I’m more into having my own space, so I’ll book a private stay. Still, I’d love to meet people - locals or expats - just to hang out, grab a drink, and soak in the city a bit more socially.

**Some random things about me:**

* Recently got into Vietnamese men’s fashion - the style here is seriously impressive  
* Big fan of coffee, so I’m planning a full-on café tour  
* I enjoy taking portraits and street photography - would be fun to link up and shoot together (or help take pics of each other, no pressure lol)  
* I’m into social drinking and might try out a bar or club or two, just to see what nightlife’s like compared to back home  
* Would be cool to meet people who know the city and are down to show me a few spots - even just casual stuff like street food, thrift stores, or a good rooftop  

**Also curious:**

* Where do people usually hang out to meet others around my age (locals or foreigners)?  
* Are there apps people actually use to meet new people here, besides Tinder?  
* Any hidden gems I should check out for fashion, coffee, or photos?  

I’m mostly just looking to meet friendly people, get to know the city better, and make the most of the trip. If you’re around and feel like hanging out - even just for a quick coffee or photo walk - drop me a message or comment :)

Thanks! Looking forward to exploring HCMC ✌️Still have loads of research to do !!

If you're just starting out, you might feel like there's never enough time in the day.



Or worse — you're working all day and still not getting much done.



Sound familiar?



In this post, I’ll share exactly how I went from chaotic freelancer to someone who gets stuff done — without burning out. 



**🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide**

**1. Create a Morning Routine**

Wake up at the same time, have coffee, maybe meditate or stretch — whatever helps you transition into work mode.



Freelancing isn’t about sleeping in — it’s about working smart.



**2. Use a Task Manager**

**Try:**



Trello (visual boards)

Notion (workspace + planner)

TickTick or Todoist (simple to-dos)

Organize by project, deadline, or priority.



**3. Try Time Blocking**

**Set specific blocks for:**



Deep work (writing, designing, coding)

Messages and emails

Meetings and calls

Planning and admin

Example:



9–11 AM: Write blog posts

11–12 PM: Respond to messages

1–3 PM: Client calls

3–5 PM: Proposals and planning

Stick to the blocks — no switching back and forth.



**4. Set Clear Work Hours**

**Tell clients:**



“I respond to messages during my work hours, which are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday.” 



Boundaries keep you sane and professional.



**5. Take Real Breaks**

**Use Pomodoro:**



25 minutes work / 5 minutes break

Or just remember:



Take a lunch break

Go for a short walk

No screens during breaks

Your brain needs rest to stay sharp.



**6. Plan Your Week**

**Every Sunday or Monday morning:**



Look at what’s due

Decide what to focus on

Set 3 big goals for the week

Then each day, pick your top 3 tasks.



**7. Learn to Say No**

**Don’t take on more than you can handle. If a client asks for something last minute and you’re already busy — say no politely:**



“I’m currently booked, but I’d love to help in \[specific future date\].” 



**💡 Pro Tip**

Use apps like Forest or Focus Keeper to stay off distractions during deep work.



**🚀 Final Note**

Time management is the secret weapon of great freelancers. Once you master it, you’ll get more done in less time — and actually enjoy your work.

But is it because you didn’t sleep enough, or because your brain’s simply tired from working hard? Understanding the difference between sleep debt and cognitive fatigue can help you recover more effectively and avoid burning out.

# Sleep Debt: The Cumulative Cost of Lost Rest

Sleep debt builds up when you don’t get enough sleep over time. It’s a biological deficit that impairs nearly every system in your body:

* Reduced memory consolidation
* Slower reaction times
* Impaired glucose metabolism
* Hormonal imbalances (like elevated cortisol and decreased testosterone)

Clues it's sleep debt:

* You feel groggy even after a morning coffee
* You struggle to wake up without an alarm
* Your mood is more irritable or anxious than usual
* You fall asleep the moment your head hits the pillow

# Cognitive Fatigue: The Brain's Burnout Button

Unlike sleep debt, cognitive fatigue can happen even after a full night’s rest. It’s the result of sustained mental effort—hours of focus, decision-making, or switching between tasks.

* Common in knowledge work and high-stakes environments
* Drains executive function, creativity, and attention
* Linked to mental burnout, not just physical tiredness

Clues it’s cognitive fatigue:

* You can’t concentrate even though you slept well
* Mental tasks feel harder than usual
* You crave distraction (social media, snacking, etc.)
* Breaks and physical movement help more than naps

# Why It Matters

Treating cognitive fatigue like sleep debt can lead to frustration. You might assume you need more sleep when what you actually need is mental recovery—like breaks, unstructured time, or switching to a different kind of task.Conversely, ignoring sleep debt and pushing through with coffee or “hustle culture” habits can backfire, leading to compounding deficits and long-term health consequences.

# How to Respond

* If it’s sleep debt: Prioritize sleep hygiene, aim for consistent bed/wake times, and catch up gradually (not all in one go).
* If it’s cognitive fatigue: Take microbreaks, reduce task-switching, get outside, or engage in low-effort creative activities.

Final Thought:Not all tiredness is created equal. Paying attention to why you're tired is the first step toward restoring energy more [intelligently.How](http://intelligently.How) do you tell the difference between brain fog and true sleepiness?",1,1747234813.0,u_FulcraDynamics,0,1.0,False

On Isabella Bennett's birthday, she waited all night. But Dominic Hinton never returned.  
  
His first love Chloe Winslow was marrying the infamous playboy in their circle today.  
  
He couldn't bare her ruin her life and rush off to stop the wedding.  
  
With swollen eyes, she sat alone in the living room all night. By morning, she received a call from an unfamiliar number.  
  
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""  
  
Hearing that nonchalant tone, Isabella instantly pictured the man of cynicism. The very playboy Dominic's precious Chloe was supposed to marry.  
  
""Lucas Montgomery?""  
  
""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" Lucas laughed with mischief. ""So I'm here to steal his. Fair's fair, right?""  
  
Isabella fell silent for a moment, then shook her head slightly. ""Seems fair enough.""  
  
On the other end, Lucas arched an eyebrow and said confidently.  
  
""Perfect. I'll arrange another wedding in fifteen days. Get yourself a dress and wait for me to marry you.""  
  
Then the line went dead.  
  
Isabella stared at the cold dinner spread across the table, tears suddenly welling in her eyes.  
  
She never imagined that after all these years of waiting, she'd finally received a proposal.  
  
But the proposal wasn't from Dominic. The groom wasn't Dominic.  
  
And the man she'd be marrying wasn't Dominic either.  
  
...  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.  
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.  
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.  
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.  
  
""Who the fuck are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.  
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.  
  
He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.  
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The trash truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless shit.”  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who the hell gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through trash.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.  
  
“The trash truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.  
  
“It was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.”  
  
Isabella’s breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.  
  
That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.  
  
No wonder he was so desperate.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The tension inside the car thickened into silence.  
  
Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.  
  
""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""  
  
These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.  
  
The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.  
  
And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn’t meant anything legally for years—was because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.  
  
The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.  
  
She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.  
  
""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""  
  
Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. “Lucas found someone new? Who told you that?”  
  
Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.  
  
But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.  
  
The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.  
  
""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I’m gonna die in there! What should I do?""  
  
""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.  
  
He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""  
  
Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.  
  
She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.  
  
After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.  
  
The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of trash under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.  
  
Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.  
  
After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.  
  
Then the housekeeper called.  
  
""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must’ve slipped there while he was sleeping.”  
  
Isabella let out a bitter laugh.  
  
How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?  
  
And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.  
  
Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.  
  
Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.  
  
She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.  
  
Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.  
  
Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.  
  
""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""  
  
Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.  
  
The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.  
  
The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.  
  
""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees—was now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.  
  
Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.  
  
Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella’s chest, leaving her gasping for air.  
  
The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.  
  
The room wasn’t fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.  
  
""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why the hell would you take the punishment for me?”  
  
Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.  
  
“I did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""  
  
""I love you, and I didn’t want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""  
  
Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.  
  
""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn’t you?""  
  
Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.  
  
Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?  
  
Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.  
  
The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.  
  
But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.  
  
""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""  
  
""Dominic’s never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?”  
  
In that moment, Isabella finally understood—marrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.  
  
All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.  
  
Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.  
  
Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.  
  
The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.  
  
""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""  
  
Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.  
  
“Played him? What exactly did I ‘play’? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me—I never forced him to do anything.""  
  
""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""  
  
Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.

1kmhbx7,https://i.redd.it/wh1l1bsuhr0f1.png,Danny Casolaro was a journalist planning to break open a huge international conspiracy before he was found in a hotel bathtub with his wrists slashed.,"On August 10th, 1991, American freelance journalist, Danny Casolaro, was found dead in a bathtub in room 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, Wes Virginia around noon, his wrists slashed deeply 10 -12 times. Paramedics found an empty Milwaukee beer can and two white plastic liner trash bags, and a single-edge blade. There was also a half-empty wine bottle nearby. Blood was splattered on the bathroom wall and floor, nothing was placed in the bathtub drain to prevent debris from draining away, and none of the bathwater was saved. There was also a suicide note from Danny which read ""To those who I love the most: Please forgive me for the worst possible thing I could have done. Most of all I'm sorry to my son. I know deep down inside that God will let me in"". There were no signs of forced entry or a struggle

The medical examiner ultimately ruled Danny's death as a suicide. Danny's death became highly controversial because at the time of his death there were notes of his that suggested he came to Martinsburg to meet a contact that could help him not only verify his claims but provide a crucial key to exposing a global conspiracy Danny had been investigating in the months and weeks prior to his death. The conspiracy was known as ' The Octopus'

The Octopus is centered on a sprawling collaboration of stories and events from the 1980s and early 90s. It involved The Inslaw case which involved INSLAW, Incorporated a computer-based company who were developing a program called ' PROMIS' in which Inslaw accused the US Justice Department of stealing 'PROMIS' and installing backdoors in which the US Government could spy on not only their citizens but other foreign Governments. The October Suprise Theory involved the Iran Hostage Crisis incident where several US Citizens and diplomats were held, hostage by a group of militarized Iranian college students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imans Line in Tehran

The October Suprise Theory goes that Iran deliberately held back the American hostages in order to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election over Jimmy Carter who was running for reelection. The Octopus also involved the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International which collapsed in July of 1991. The bank itself was under heavy scrutiny due to massive amounts of money laundering and other financial crimes. It also involved the Iran-Contra affair which was a political scandal involving the Regan Administration supplying weapons to the Islamist Khomeini government of the Islam Republic of Iran which went on for 6 years from 1981 - 1986

Danny's family believes Danny's death was the result of murder and not a suicide because Danny is very squeamish around blood and feared blood tests so they find it very hard to believe Danny was suicidal and slashed his own wrists. They also argued in the months and weeks leading up to Danny's death, Danny told his brother he had been receiving harassing phone calls late at night with some threatening to kill him and Danny even told his brother if something were to happen to him in Martinsburg it would not be an accident

The last known sightings of Danny occurred the day before his death when he was seen eating at a Pizza Hut in Martinsburg where he told one of the waitresses he liked her eyes and quoted The Great Gatsby to her. He then went on to meet an engineer named Henry Turner at the Sheraton Hotel around 2:30 pm. Apparently, Turner had given Danny documents and only spoke for a few minutes before parting ways. Witnesses report seeing Danny spending the next few hours at a restaurant where a bartender said Danny seemed lonely and depressed to him. There were also reports that Danny was seen at Heatherfields, the cocktail lounge in Sheraton at around 5 pm with a man described as Iranian

Around 5:30 pm, Danny met Mike Looney who was staying in the room next to Danny's. The two would first chat around 5:30 and then again at 8 pm. Looney stated Danny was waiting to meet a contact who was going to give him information to solve a huge case ( The Octopus) and Danny was meant to meet this contact around 9 pm. Danny briefly excused himself to make a phone call and upon returning, Danny said to Looney the contact ' Might have blown him off '. Danny and Looney would continue talking until 9:30 pm before parting ways. Danny was then last seen alive at around 10 pm buying coffee at a convenience store

The investigation into Danny's death was controversial, to say the least as there have been accusations according to the FBI that police were very uncooperative when the FBI got involved with the case they were met with almost complete resistance from the Martinsburg police and prosecutor’s office. Reports indicated despite the FBI having lied to Congress about not looking into the case, police withholding crucial evidence from the expert witness - Dr. Henry Lee, who initially concluded Danny committed suicide before realizing the police withheld evidence making him believe Danny did not commit suicide and there had been the presence of towels to wipe up blood at the scene of the crime

Interestingly there have been conflicting statements in regards to a briefcase Danny had which contained all the files, notes, and documents he obtained on the Octopus Conspiracy. Despite interviewing all the hotel employees who had contact with Danny, despite never finding the briefcase the hotel front desk employee recalled seeing Danny carrying a brown briefcase. This could indicate someone else was there during Danny's death and retrieved his briefcase

More than half the agents of the FBI looked into the case, questioning the conclusion of Danny committing suicide and requesting this investigation be looked into further but were pressured to stop at the risk of losing their job. Also apparently both the FBI and DOJ argued about the status of Danny's file with the DOJ claiming more than 90% of it has gone missing

So what do you think happened to Danny Casolaro? Was Danny on the verge of exposing a massive conspiracy that was said to be worse than Watergate? Or did Danny's findings lead to a dead end and he did end up committing suicide?

Here are the following links to Danny, his case, and reasons why not to trust the suicide conclusion which leads to further in-depth articles on those reasons, The Inslaw Case, Iran-Contra, October Suprise, and more

I’m sorry this is so long, it would mean a lot to me if anyone read it all the way and could just send me some love. 
I really need it 😔

My brother and his girlfriend of 6 years broke up and I don’t know what to even do with my feelings right now.

We were so close and have been through so much together and have stuck by each others side when we were struggling, cheered each other on when we wanted to give up and celebrated each others wins however big or small. We’ve been an ear for each other and a shoulder to lean on and we’re both completely ourselves around each other and have so much fun. We share so many memories from just getting a coffee, cooking, singing, dancing around like fools and laughing, watching movies and tv shows, sending each other funny videos, late night d&m’s, working out together, washing/walking/trimming the dogs, playing board games and card games on family nights or just the two of us, to bigger things like graduations, weddings, starting new jobs, her niece being born and that whole pregnancy, Christmas’s, birthdays, family events and gatherings, we’ve even traveled together and she’s basically lived with us for the last 5 years. 
I genuinely love her like a sister and she’s brought out the best in my brother and my younger sister who is still in high school completely adores and looks up to her. She’s so thoughtful and caring which my mum loves and she is able to make quick witted jokes and has a great sense of humour which my dad loves and even my cat who is scared of everyone except me loves her and will snuggle right up to her.

I’ve been holding everything in because it’s not about me and I feel like it’s so selfish of me to even think about myself but I’m hurting so badly. 
There’s an empty seat at the table, and a space in the driveway where her car is usually parked. All the little things like seeing her charger in the wall, her shoes and slippers next to the bed, her drink bottle and lip balm and a book on her bedside table, her toothbrush and make up, that’s all completely cleared now. No more seeing her and my little sister do their skin care together or sitting and having a cup of tea with my mum or checking the football score with my dad, no more scaring each other in the hallway or funny little inside jokes, no more little photo updates of her niece, she won’t be there to watch my brothers basketball games and we won’t be their to watch her hockey games. Just all the normal every day things that aren’t necessarily important, but that she’s always there and a part of it all. And now she’s not. 

I knew something wasn’t right and I asked my brother on multiple occasions if he was alright and even asked the girls at his work if he was ok and got nothing. She stopped sending or reacting to the funny videos I sent her and was acting distant and I haven’t seen her for two weeks but she goes back and forth between our house and hers so I tried to convince myself that maybe she just had lots on over the last few weeks, especially because no one was telling me anything. 

Last night I saw her briefly but it was because she came over to get her things and leave her key and my brother brought her stuff out to her because she didn’t want to come inside. I only saw her because I happened to be home and was going out so stopped in the driveway and said hello to her through our car windows, otherwise she wouldn’t have said anything to me. 

They didn’t tell me, they just completely left me out and I know they don’t have to say anything at all, but like, not even a goodbye? 💔

I went through a break up 18 months ago and my world felt like it was caving in, but this feels different, worse even. I feel like I’ve just lost a massive chunk of my heart and there’s a huge hole in my life without her. 

Again, it’s not about me so I’ve kept this to myself because the last thing I want to do is take any of the attention, but god I feel sick. Did I really not deserve to be told? Maybe it’s nothing to do with me at all, but I just can’t shake the thought that maybe she didn’t even like me this whole time. 
I know it’s silly and unhelpful to think like that, and everyone grieves in different ways so maybe it wasn’t personal that I was left out. I’m sure she’s probably really sad a well and I want nothing more than to be with her and talk to her and laugh like we always do. 

Everyone is weirdly stoic and I feel really conflicted and confused about it. My brother said it was mutual and things hadn’t been as good the last few months so maybe that’s why he’s not falling apart like I was after my breakup. He seems pretty normal even though of course he is sad, and maybe he didn’t want to tell me because he was too sad to talk about it or maybe they’d already come to terms with it and so it wasn’t a huge shock, and instead a fizzling out. Probably both.

I’m just so, so deeply sad and am sitting in my car sobbing as I write this. Am I just never going to see her again now? I know she would’ve been trying so hard to keep it together when she saw me and that’s probably why she avoided me, otherwise she might’ve lost it, but so is that just it then? No more new memories ever again? I doubt she’ll want to hang out with me now if she couldn’t even say hello. What am I going to do, it’s unfair of me to feel like this and it would be very frowned upon if I let it show, so I can’t say any of this to anyone. But I don’t want to just live life without her now, how can I?

The thing seems to turn on correctly, but when pressing the button to make espresso- regardless of single or double- it never finishes making the drink, instead “stopping” short. This causes us to either have to press it 10-20 times to get a shot (sometimes this doesn’t even work) or give up entirely.

I tried troubleshooting online which suggested I was filling with too much grounds, so have already tried dialing it back. This didn’t work. Emailing them has not been helpful.

Hi, I am a 28f who just was diagnosed yesterday with genital herpes. I have a boyfriend that I've been dating for over a year and we just moved in together along with my almost 3 yo. I have been obsessively washing my hands around my almost 3 yo and am afraid for him to even get near me. Of course hes acting out cause im not feeling well and im kind of shut down. I've never in my life experienced an ailment between my legs that has been so aggressive. I'm kind of shocked my doctor diagnosed me but didnt give me any kind of education on how to ease my raging symptoms associated with this virus. Not to mention I had no idea I'd feel so bad all around.  So.. I turned to reddit where I've found an abundance of information thank God. I'm just feeling super alone. My work is pissed because I called out yesterday and I feel like i have no support because I don't want my family or friends to know what I'm going through. I have so many mixed emotions because for so long I refused to take care of myself and work two jobs and run myself ragged and essentially I gave this condition to myself. I was aware I had herpes simplex but no one ever educated me that even if you have no mouth sores or open sores vaginally you can still transmit this virus so, I transmitted it to my bf via oral then we must have passed it back and forth. So here I sit, with my breakfast, coffee, lysine, multivitamin, antiviral, and probiotic looking at a version of myself I'm completely ashamed of. Not just because of the herpes but I've ultimately done this to myself without knowing. Maybe I'm going through some sort of ego death here or transformation. For now, some kind words of encouragement would be nice. ",1,1747234629.0,HSVpositive,2,1.0,False

""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala—clearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite—the one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing—gotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

How it happened: I posted a pic of avocado toast on Reddit (my ""last Reddit post,"" or so I thought). Got a bunch of DMs—some weird, a couple of them nice. But one stood out. It was so sweet and respectful, so disarming, so genuinely kind, it caught me off guard. It actually made me smile. What did it say? ""Will you freak out if I said I'd like to buy you a coffee at a local filter kaapi place? No wrong intentions—you can say no, and I won’t mind.""

I was skeptical. I hesitated. Happens with guys too. But there was something so simple and genuine about it. Filter kaapi, at a local coffee shop—it felt cute and sweet. So, against my usual instincts, I said yes.

We connected on social media, talked a bit online first, then finally decided to meet up. And guess what? It was just as sweet and easy as that first message. No pressure, no weirdness—just good conversation and good coffee.

I don’t know who to thank—the universe for nudging me, or her for sending that DM in the first place. I guess I have to thank both of you. But, a special thanks to the stranger.. For the DM, coffee, conversations, and for giving me one of the nicest days in a long time..

Maybe it was serendipity. Maybe it was kismet. Or maybe it was just two people having coffee on an ordinary day that turned out to be kind of special. Either way, I’m glad it happened. ☕️☕️",4,1747234609.0,IndianFoodPhotos,3,1.0,False

Hi, I am a 28f who just was diagnosed yesterday with genital herpes. I have a boyfriend that I've been dating for over a year and we just moved in together along with my almost 3 yo. I have been obsessively washing my hands around my almost 3 yo and am afraid for him to even get near me. Of course hes acting out cause im not feeling well and im kind of shut down. I've never in my life experienced an ailment between my legs that has been so aggressive. I'm kind of shocked my doctor diagnosed me but didnt give me any kind of education on how to ease my raging symptoms associated with this virus. Not to mention I had no idea I'd feel so bad all around.  So.. I turned to reddit where I've found an abundance of information thank God. I'm just feeling super alone. My work is pissed because I called out yesterday and I feel like i have no support because I don't want my family or friends to know what I'm going through. I have so many mixed emotions because for so long I refused to take care of myself and work two jobs and run myself ragged and essentially I gave this condition to myself. I was aware I had herpes simplex but no one ever educated me that even if you have no mouth sores or open sores vaginally you can still transmit this virus so, I transmitted it to my bf via oral then we must have passed it back and forth. So here I sit, with my breakfast, coffee, lysine, multivitamin, antiviral, and probiotic looking at a version of myself I'm completely ashamed of. Not just because of the herpes but I've ultimately done this to myself without knowing. Maybe I'm going through some sort of ego death here or transformation. For now, some kind words of encouragement would be nice. ",3,1747234507.0,Herpes,6,1.0,False

But the material and overall service was below par since day 1 and there are major errors in measurements and also 3D drawings.
As per the quote he did not complete the work in given time and we paid him 80% money upfront, 20% was left and he threatened us to pay everything upfront which we denied.

As per the quote it says 50% advance and 50% progress payment.

They completed work half e.g got the dining table and no sofa, no chairs, no coffee table, no curtains, half made tv unit, promised german hardware installed Chinese everywhere and kept saying we will change in the end. Drawers don’t open. Gaps in installations. 

Bed has no hydraulics, no curtains installed.


I several times reached out to him saying that you first complete the work and fix your stuff and then take the payment at the same and we are ready to sign the contract for this in written. It was ignored, he just kept demanding 20%.

Everything else was ignored. 

We were without curtians gor 45 days so we had to get this done from elshwere  and also the other stuff made from different vendors which cost us more than we were supposed to pay.

I even shared bills from the sofa and kurtain vendor and asked him that we are ready to take loss of advance payment done to sofa vendor and cancelled kurtains order (but he never obliged) 

We eventually had to get the work completed from elsewhere because it was honestly brutal sleeping in rooms w/o curtains.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 1: Liora & Aeva**

**""Beep beep beep.""** Liora’s 6:30 a.m. alarm blared. She slowly opened her eyes and tried to roll onto her side—but a sharp pain flared beneath her right breast. She froze. She knew what it was. Her worst prediction had arrived. Next year would be filled with doctor visits, scans, and aggressive rounds of chemotherapy.

Two years ago, she'd lost her husband in a tragic car accident, leaving her and their 11-year-old daughter, Aeva, to navigate life alone. And now this.

How would she tell Aeva? How would she explain that the world might shift again, just when it had started to feel steady? Aeva had adored her father—he was her anchor, her hero, her everything.

Liora sat up abruptly and shook her head. **Not today.  I am not going to think about it today, I will think about it tomorrow.**

 She wouldn’t let her mind spiral. Not today. Today was important.

 Today was Friday—**Bring Your Kid to Work Day** at AetherCore, and this year, it wasn’t just an internal celebration. News crews from across the country were covering the event, calling it a “landmark in corporate transparency and youth education.”

Major networks were streaming it live. Cameras were stationed in the lobby, conference areas, and even the orientation rooms.

Liora was a Level 3 engineer at AetherCore, one of the most advanced technology corporations on the planet. She worked alongside leading neuroscientists, developing systems that fused human biology with computing power to enhance sensory perception and fight disease.

Suddenly, Aeva burst into the room, wide-eyed and brimming with energy, twirling around in a flurry of outfit options. “Mom! Mom! You have to get up—we’re going to be late!”

Aeva had wanted to be a scientist for as long as she could remember. She’d been counting the days ever since Liora mentioned the event. Today, she’d get to see parts of **AetherCore** that were usually off-limits—even to employees’ families—and she could barely contain her excitement.

Liora moved briskly through her morning routine, her motions mechanical and precise. In her mind, she ticked off the list: Breakfast for Aeva—check. Lunches packed—check. Backpack by the door—check.

She flicked on the news as she tied her shoes, just to stay ahead of the day’s headlines. The screen lit up with a well-groomed anchor in a polished studio, her tone upbeat and professional.

“Today marks AetherCore’s first ever Bring-Your-Kid-to-Work Day open to the media. Dozens of children will be allowed access to normally restricted areas inside one of the world’s leading biotech companies. The event is being broadcast live across multiple networks and streamed to millions. The goal? Inspiring the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators.”

A clip rolled of kids from the previous year’s private event walking through gleaming corridors and peering into labs, followed by footage of this morning’s crowd already forming outside the building.

Liora let it run in the background as she zipped Aeva’s lunch bag closed.

The next segment cut in sharply, jarring against the light tone of the previous report. A grainy video filled the screen—shaky cell phone footage of glowing orbs in the sky.

“In other news, another string of alleged alien sightings has social media buzzing again. This latest video, captured just outside Flagstaff, Arizona, shows what some claim to be ‘intelligent formation patterns’—”

Liora rolled her eyes and shut the TV off. “People really need a new hobby,” she mumbled, grabbing her car keys.

“Let’s go!” she called down the hall. Aeva came bounding out, practically glowing with excitement.

And with that, they were out the door.

**Chapter 2: AetherCore** 

The AetherCore campus stood just outside the city limits, modern but unflashy—clean lines, glass panels, and a quiet confidence in its design. Liora pulled into the employee lot, scanned her badge at the gate, and drove through as Aeva leaned forward in her seat, eyes wide.

“Is *all* of this AetherCore?”

“Just the research side,” Liora said. “The administrative buildings are across the road.”

Inside, the lobby was anything but quiet. Dozens of employees had brought their children, and the space buzzed with voices, laughter, and the hum of conversation. Kids darted between their parents' legs, clutching visitor badges and paper maps, while staff tried to wrangle the chaos with clipboards and practiced smiles.

Liora and Aeva stepped in and were immediately greeted by a cheerful volunteer. “Welcome! Visitor pass for Aeva?”

Liora handed over the printed form, and within seconds, Aeva had a bright yellow lanyard around her neck.

“You’re in Group B,” the volunteer said. “Tours start in about ten minutes—feel free to grab a snack or look around.”

Liora nodded politely and guided Aeva to the side, away from the thickest crowd. They passed a long wall lined with framed patents and milestone photos—teams posing beside early prototypes, celebration shots from breakthroughs in neural scanning, awards from medical journals.

“Wow,” Aeva whispered. “You’re part of *this*?”

Liora glanced at her daughter, then at the wall. “Yeah. A small part.”

Children were asking questions. Parents tried to explain without getting too technical. Someone had set up a table with simplified brain models and little puzzles meant to simulate how neurons fire. A few older kids were already in deep conversation with one of the junior engineers.

Aeva grinned. “This is amazing.”

Liora gave a soft chuckle. “Just wait till we get upstairs.”

A voice over the lobby intercom chimed in: **“Attention all Bring-Your-Kid-to-Work Day participants—please begin moving toward the North Hallway. Staff will guide children and parents to their assigned areas.”**

Almost immediately, the energy shifted. Volunteers in branded lanyards started organizing the crowd, directing kids to gather near the large double doors at the far end of the lobby. Parents were gently ushered in the opposite direction.

“Looks like it’s time,” Liora said, nudging Aeva.

Aeva tightened her grip on her mom’s hand for a moment. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Not yet,” Liora said with a soft smile. “They want to give you all a rundown first. I’ll be close the whole time.”

Aeva nodded, a mix of nerves and excitement flickering in her eyes. She stepped into the growing group of kids, now forming a long, winding line. Volunteers handed out printed schedules, clip-on name tags, and small tote bags filled with notebooks, pencils, and company swag.

Liora watched her disappear into the crowd, then turned to follow the other parents through a separate hallway. They were led into a large, modern conference room with several rows of seats and wall-mounted screens already lit up. The screens showed a multi-angle view of the kids’ lunchroom—wide overhead shots and closer feeds from cameras mounted in the corners.

A company rep in a clean, navy-blue blazer stepped to the front.

“Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AetherCore,” she began. “While your children are being introduced to the day’s activities, we’ll be giving you an overview of the safety protocols, the learning sessions planned, and the areas they’ll be visiting. After this briefing, we’ll break into smaller groups so you can rotate as parent chaperones.”

Liora took a seat toward the back, crossing her arms as she scanned the screens. Aeva had already found a seat near the front of the kids' room, chatting animatedly with the girl next to her.

For the first time that morning, Liora let herself breathe.

At least for today, everything felt… okay.

The presentation had just begun. On the screens, the kids were seated in rows, chatting among themselves as a young staff member passed out folders and gave directions from the front of the room.

Liora glanced at Aeva on the feed—still talking, gesturing excitedly with her hands.

Then the screens flickered.

A quick blink. Then black.

The lights in the conference room dimmed at the same moment. Murmurs rippled through the crowd of parents.

“Did we lose the feed?”

“Is this part of the program?”

Liora sat forward, suddenly alert.

Seconds stretched. The screens stayed black. The silence in the room deepened, thickened.

Then—**click.**

The lights in the kids’ lunchroom came back on. But the children were gone.

Every single seat was empty.

Instead, in the center of the room stood five figures.

They wore plain, neutral-toned clothing—nothing flashy, nothing high-tech—but something about them was unmistakably wrong. Too still. Too calm. Their posture was relaxed, almost casual, yet there was a quiet, unsettling confidence in the way they held themselves. Like they weren’t surprised to be here.

A hush fell over the room. You could hear someone’s breath catch.

The company rep stepped forward, her voice tight. “Please stay calm. We’re likely experiencing a temporary system malfunction.”

But no one believed that.

Gasps filled the conference space. A few parents rose from their seats.

But it wasn’t just this room watching.

Every major network still broadcasting the event—**ABC, CNN, SkyStream, VSN, dozens of smaller outlets**—was still live. The footage was being streamed in homes, on phones, in schools, in coffee shops.

Liora’s eyes locked onto the screen, heart pounding. She leaned toward the woman next to her. “Where are the kids?”

The woman didn’t answer. She was frozen, staring straight ahead, mouth slightly open.

The figures on screen hadn’t moved. They just stood there, staring—at nothing, at everything.

One of the parents stood up. “Is this a joke? What the hell is going on?”

No answer.

Liora’s instincts kicked in. Something was very, very wrong.

And for the first time in a long time, her fear wasn’t about the future or a diagnosis.

It was about *right now*.

Starting from my parents getting divorced, and my dad moved apartments like every 6 months or so. 
Then he started dating, and so we moved in with his girlfriend at the time. I guess it started by making sure I wouldn't wake up in a random place I don't know? Perhaps it started from a fight or flight response, but I'm not sure what it is now for it to be like a daily occurrence when I'm in a safe space. 
I remember going to kindergarten knowing I would only get about an hour of sleep during a nap or something. It was fine until my late teens, when I could stay up, barely sleep, and not feel the effect of that. 
I can only sleep during the day, it seems. 
Nighttime is when I'm most awake unless I have a few days where I trick myself into sleeping during the night.  Maybe I have a problem with my circadian rhythm, maybe it's my cortisol levels. 
I do sleep 5-6 hours at times, when I literally have nothing to do. 
But if I have a job or am in class. Which is bound to be present in my life, I usually only get 30 minutes- 2 hours, and I'm grateful if I see five hours. 
I've never been taken to a sleep doctor, but there are days I'll be awake with barely any sleep between. I've been in a lot of 24-hour facilities for other things, so I've had nurses log my sleep for years now. 
I guess I'm scared that now that I'm an adult, that 
I'll be seeing the consequences more heavily of my 14-year problem. 
I've never really looked into it or asked for support because being an insomniac is almost normal for me, I don't think much about it. 
I will stay up for like 3 days and then pass out for hours, so it's super inconsistent, and I feel none of those are very healthy. 
To graduate high school, I would literally get 30 minutes of sleep, or none. 
Drink 3-5 shots of espresso a day to stay up in class. (until I had to cut out coffee because now it makes me sick or have panic attacks) 
 And then nap during the classes, I could catch up on it later. 
By the time it reached the end of the school day, I was hallucinating and/or delirious. 
The only time I slept ""normal"" was when I was on a med with a muscle exhaustion side effect. 7pm came around, and it suddenly felt like I did 3 leg days in a row, so yeah,, never going on that med again. 
I burn off sleep meds so bad. I was on a med used to assist with anesthesia, and I stayed up on that. 
Which makes me afraid that if I need surgery, I might not respond to it, but anyway. 
People suggesting sleep hygiene don't work for me. 
Suggesting sleep meds, I burn them off or they make me drowsy for days, which isn't good when I need to work or focus on something like school. 
There's not really a good balance.

Is this a specific type of insomnia?

1kmh4t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kmh4t8/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_friend/,I don’t know how to help my friend,"My friends and I all met at my past job (I resigned and found something better), but while I was there I found out that Amy (37f) had a crush on Kevin (38m). I admit yes Kevin is a very attractive man, and he’s a very hard worker as well. Kevin and I get along like siblings. We can joke and tease each other and talk about any subject and he’s even helped me in tight situations like when a homeless man was bothering me, he shielded me and had me return to the building instead of completing my task that I was doing outside.

Amy tries very hard to get Kevin’s attention like leaving him little gifts for subtly doing her make up (which she rarely ever does). She tries to dress up a little bit but due to the nature of our job it’s not like we can wear a dress or anything. She keeps talking about wanting to color her hair red after she found out Kevin thinks girls with red hair is hot. The even was envious of me cutting my hair to shoulder length and coloring it purple, in which I responded “life is too short to not be adventurous”, to which Kevin admired, making Amy want to change her appearance even more. Amy and I became close friends because we are both hard workers but have similar interests. We talk about anime, manga, animals, she became like a big sister to me.

There was also some drama involving another girl at work Brittney (38f). She always seemed to have a problem come up with her house, her car, her kids, her bills, etc. while I am sympathetic knowing she’s a single mother because their father was in prison, I felt bad at one point because she needed a ride to work and for a while I would pick her up because at the time I lived close by. She would use Kevin as a way to get home because I have a second job and cannot take her home.

Brittney and Amy have always had a strange relationship. Years ago Amy loaned Brittney almost $1500 which she never got back. On top of that, when Amy slipped and admitted she liked Kevin, Brittney made a move on him. They were best friends at the time so I thought it was strange when Amy told me this story.

I always thought Amy’s crush on my work brother Kevin was cute. She’d always get all blush, nervous around him to the point she is shaken and can’t even eat, stuff like that. One day I took Amy and without really telling her, I took her to Kevin’s apartment to have lunch and we ended up playing a video game while Kevin worked on his second job. Me stretching out on Kevin’s bed, going through his drawers, and walking around his apartment barefoot(it’s a habit, in my house we leave our shoes at the door) caught Amy off guard but again, Kevin is like a brother to me and he was ok with it.

Fast forward to this month. Brittney slipped that Kevin now has a girlfriend and Amy is heartbroken. The once joyful and funny person I knew died. She even took a week vacation (which she rarely does unless it’s to help her family with home improvement projects) just to heal from the heart ache. One day we were having drinks and Amy starts crying that Kevin now has a girlfriend. How she’s tried for so many years to get him to notice her. How it felt like he died in her heart. 

I feel bad but I couldn’t take listening to her crying about Kevin every day so I snapped and told her “Kevin was never yours to begin with” to which she started crying even harder. I immediately apologized and hugged her. Thankfully we were alone in her apartment drinking and watching funny videos so no one knows about this.

What do I do? What CAN I do? Amy and Kevin still work together and I work at a new company. I know it must be hard for Amy to see Kevin every single day. I try to invite her out on her days off to get a coffee or people watch or feed birds, just to get outside. But now I can’t get her to leave the bed or stop crying and I feel so helpless. She barely returns my messages and one of our mutual friends Christian even tried to reach out and has physically gone into her apartment (he knows the door code but I don’t) and he also can’t get her to budge.

Hi there, I am one of the many many late-diagnosed women for whom a lot of things are starting to make sense. 

(My mum sought a diagnosis in 1990 but was told by the GP, and I quote, “girls don’t have that.” The school said I couldn’t possibly have it because I was such a strong student. Gotta love masking!) 

Anyway, the point of this post: I was just prescribed Ritalin (10 mg to start) and wondering how to take it to combat my biggest struggle, which is finding it absolutely impossible to get up and get moving in the morning. I don’t have to report to work, so I will faff about until 11 am easy, and then struggle to sit down and do my work. 

My question:

Can I just wake up and immediately take Ritalin? Without food? (I am in Southern Europe and I wasn’t given any instructions for how to take it)  

And then when can I drink coffee?

My work is pissed because I called out yesterday and I feel like i have no support because I don't want my family or friends to know what I'm going through. I have so many mixed emotions because for so long I refused to take care of myself and work two jobs and run myself ragged and essentially I gave this condition to myself. I was aware I had herpes simplex but no one ever educated me that even if you have no mouth sores or open sores vaginally you can still transmit this virus so, I transmitted it to my bf via oral then we must have passed it back and forth. So here I sit, with my breakfast, coffee, lysine, multivitamin, antiviral, and probiotic looking at a version of myself I'm completely ashamed of. Not just because of the herpes but I've ultimately done this to myself without knowing. Maybe I'm going through some sort of ego death here or transformation.

Sleepovers, endless gossip sessions, makeup hauls, spontaneous coffee runs, we were that duo. She’s been one of my closest people, someone I’ve shared some of my biggest secrets with.

She has this habit of ghosting people occasionally. I’ve seen it happen before, and even though I don’t love it, I always tried to understand. I know she struggles with being consistent sometimes.

A while ago, she told me, very privately, that she was planning a Europe trip with her uncle, but she didn’t want to tell anyone because she was scared of ""evil vibes"" or jinxing it. I respected that and kept it between us. Later, she told me she had decided not to go because of this recent India-Pakistan tension, and I was like, okay, makes sense.

But now I’m seeing her Instagram stories… and she’s there. In Europe. Clearly having a great time. And she’s not replying to my messages at all, on iMessage, Instagram, nothing. Just silence.

It’s not even the trip that’s upsetting me. It’s the hiding. The sudden distance. The feeling of being shut out without any explanation. I thought we had that kind of bond where we could just be real with each other.

And here’s the messy part: I think I might be a little attracted to her, too. It’s not something I’ve ever made a big deal out of maybe not even fully figured out for myself but it’s there, somewhere in the mix. And maybe that’s part of why this feels extra confusing and heavy.

I know she cares about me. I really do. But right now, I just feel left out, a little hurt, and honestly kind of lost. I don’t know if I’m overthinking or if I just expected too much. I just wish she’d talk to me.

As per the quote he did not complete the work in given time and we paid him 80% money upfront, 20% was left and he threatened us to pay everything upfront which we denied.

As per the quote it says 50% advance and 50% progress payment.

They completed work half e.g got the dining table and no sofa, no chairs, no coffee table, no curtains, half made tv unit, promised german hardware installed Chinese everywhere and kept saying we will change in the end. Drawers don’t open. Gaps in installations. 

Bed has no hydraulics, no curtains installed.


I several times reached out to him saying that you first complete the work and fix your stuff and then take the payment at the same and we are ready to sign the contract for this in written. It was ignored, he just kept demanding 20%.

Everything else was ignored. 

We were without curtians gor 45 days so we had to get this done from elshwere  and also the other stuff made from different vendors which cost us more than we were supposed to pay.

I even shared bills from the sofa and kurtain vendor and asked him that we are ready to take loss of advance payment done to sofa vendor and cancelled kurtains order (but he never obliged) 

We eventually had to get the work completed from elsewhere because it was honestly brutal sleeping in rooms w/o curtains.

Originally it set out as a project to make up for weaknesses in my python coding. As you know, coding can be very unique; similar to art work or music, you can accomplish many things with different instruments or brushes and palettes. My point is, maybe what I needed to supplement my workflow, you don't. Or the next person does, but in a different way.

And what started as that personal toolkit to help me get a better handle on my own Python projects kinda snowballed (pun intended, maybe?). I realized I probably wasn't the only dev out there banging my head against the wall trying to make these awesome new LLMs actually work for complex, day-to-day coding on my own desktop, without it turning into a science fair project every single time.

You know the drill: juggling different models, trying to give them enough local context so they don't just hallucinate nonsense, and feeling like half your time is spent just setting things up instead of getting actual work done. I wanted something that felt like a real partner, something that understood my local files and could help with those bigger, multi-step tasks.

So, AvA (Advanced Versatile Assistant) grew into what it is now: a Python/PyQt6 desktop app designed to be that intelligent 'Codex Keeper.' The core idea is to give you a sane, powerful way to use local LLMs (like CodeLlama, Llama3 via Ollama – so your code stays private and you can work offline) and also tap into cloud models like Gemini when you need that extra horsepower. The real game-changer, I think, is its advanced RAG system that can actually understand your local codebases, PDFs, and DOCX files, giving the AI deep contextual awareness. On top of that, I've been building out a multi-file code modification workflow, where a 'Planner AI' (like Gemini) can strategize changes across multiple files, guiding a 'Generator AI' (like CodeLlama) to do the actual coding.

And listen, while my examples so far might sound developer-focused because that's my world, the fundamental power of AvA – that ability to deeply understand your specific documents and data through its RAG system – isn't just limited to us coders. Maybe you need an AI to become an expert on legal documents you feed it, or to help you dissect trading strategies based on historical data you provide. Perhaps you're a teacher looking to build a custom assistant for your students, or a doctor needing a tool to quickly analyze and cross-reference medical research papers. That’s the core idea here: AvA's built as a flexible platform. You load it with your knowledge, for your specific domain.

Plus, and this one hits close to home for me: maybe you do want to tap into this AI revolution, maybe even for coding, but all you’ve got to work with is the tech equivalent of a toaster and two fresh potatoes. Maybe you can't afford to be racking up massive API costs every time you want to generate more than a few lines of code or get some analysis done. That was me, and it’s a huge reason AvA is built to lean heavily on local LLMs running right on your desktop – to make powerful AI genuinely accessible, even if you're not working with a FAANG-level budget.

It's one thing for me to talk about it, but it's probably better if I just show you. Here’s a quick look at AvA actually doing its thing – in this case, it takes a prompt about some RAG-loaded files, then you get to see its Planner AI (Gemini) and Generator AI (CodeLlama) collaborate, going back and forth a couple of times to refine the approach, generate code across two files, and finally, AvA summarizes its own 'thought process' behind the whole operation!

So, How Does AvA Do That? (The ""Secret Sauce"")

That GIF gives you a taste, but you might be wondering what’s actually going on under the hood to make all that happen, right? It’s not just a simple call to a single LLM, especially for the more complex stuff like refactoring or generating code across multiple files.

The core of AvA's approach for these tasks is a two-step AI dance I've been refining: a ""Planner AI"" and a ""Generator AI"" working together.

Here’s the lowdown:

The Planner (The Brains): This is usually a capable chat model (like Gemini in many of my tests). Its job is to understand your overall request, break down the problem, strategize the steps, and use all that rich RAG context from your local files. Crucially, this Planner AI doesn't have to be Gemini. The architecture is designed so you could eventually use other powerful chat models here – maybe even a hefty local one if you've got the silicon – as long as it's good at reasoning and can 'talk' effectively to the next guy.
The Generator (The Brawn): The Planner then intelligently prompts a specialized AI – often a local coding model like CodeLlama running via Ollama – to do the actual heavy lifting: writing new code, modifying existing functions, etc., based on the plan.
It's actually pretty wild to watch them collaborate. I had this moment early on when I was first getting it working – it genuinely looked like the Planner (Gemini) and the Generator (CodeLlama) were almost 'arguing.' The Planner would send instructions, Llama would come back with some code or a question, Gemini would analyze that and send back a refined prompt or a correction, and Llama would try again. They went back and forth a couple of times and actually hammered out a solution that was way better than what I initially had in mind, or what either AI might have produced on its own. That’s when I knew this kind of orchestrated, multi-AI approach was something special.

The beauty of this system, apart from getting more sophisticated results, is also about efficiency and not emptying your wallet. Instead of trying to stuff massive codebases into a prompt for a big, expensive cloud model every single time you want to make a change (which, believe me, gets costly fast), the Planner AI does the smart, targeted 'light chatting' and coordination. The Generator AI, which you can run locally and for free using Ollama, then handles the bulk of the code output. It keeps your API calls much leaner and your potential costs way down, especially when you're iterating a lot during development. For a solo dev like me, that’s a game-changer.

Key Features at a Glance:

🤖 Run LLMs Your Way: Seamlessly switch between local models via Ollama (like CodeLlama or Llama3 for privacy, offline work, and no API costs) and powerful cloud APIs like Google's Gemini when you need that extra kick.
🧠 Deep Project Understanding (Advanced RAG): This isn't just a fancy chatbot. AvA’s RAG system can actually ingest and understand your local codebases, PDFs, DOCX files, and more, providing deep, relevant context to the AI.
✨ AI-Powered Code Transformation: Go way beyond single-line completions. AvA features a unique workflow where a ""Planner AI"" (e.g., Gemini) strategizes changes across multiple files, guiding a specialized ""Generator AI"" (e.g., your local CodeLlama) to implement the code.
🔧 Truly Versatile & Extensible: While the first release is heavily geared towards developers, AvA's core (especially that RAG system) is designed for broad use. Load it with your legal docs, trading data, research papers, web design assets – tailor it to your domain. (Yes, even if you're starting with just a ""toaster and 2 fresh potatoes"" setup!)
💻 Native Desktop Experience: Built with Python and PyQt6 for a responsive, project-based UI that runs right on your machine.
🤝 Refine & Iterate Until It's Right: First pass not quite what you wanted? No sweat. AvA's built for back-and-forth. You can tell her directly to make changes, clarify your instructions, and keep tweaking the generated code or content until it's spot-on. No more being stuck with a take-it-or-leave-it output.
A Bit More About Why I Poured My Life Into AvA (The ""My Story"" Bit)

So, you've seen what AvA does and a bit about how it works. But the ""why"" behind it all? That's pretty personal, and it's the fuel that's kept me going on this solo dev journey.

This project isn't just another piece of software for me. It's born from a lot of hard-won experience. I was a bit of a ""lost kid"" growing up. I didn't go to college – my folks couldn't afford it, and honestly, by the time young me figured out that good grades were a key to unlocking some doors, it felt like that particular ship had already sailed. So, I know what it’s like to have the drive and the ideas but to hit wall after wall because you don't have the traditional resume, the resources, or because it feels like no one's willing to give you a real shot.

There have been times in my life when things were incredibly tough – I'm talking water-shut-off, eating-straight-peanut-butter-because-bread-was-a-luxury kind of tough, watching my wife go through the stress of it all with me. Those experiences, they stick with you. They change you.

I mentioned the ""toaster and two fresh potatoes"" setup earlier – that was my reality for a long time. And it’s a huge part of why I’m so passionate about making powerful AI tools like AvA accessible, especially with its support for local LLMs. Because I believe talent and drive are everywhere, but opportunity isn't.

My real, gut-level hope for AvA, the thing that keeps me dragging my feet to the keyboard even when I'm exhausted or that ocean in my head is raging, is that it finds its way to some young, broke, super-fucking-smart kid out there. Someone who sees it and has those gears start turning. Someone who thinks, ""You know what? If I use my massive fucking brain, dedicate myself, and work my ass off with a tool like this… I can change my life. I can make something that matters. I can feed my family.""

If AvA can be that catalyst for even one person, if it can give them the shot I often felt I never got, then every ounce of the struggle to build it will have been worth it. I'm putting my 100% into this, and I genuinely hope it can make a difference for someone else, too.

So, What Now? Here’s How You Can Dive In & Help:

AvA is currently in Alpha, and I'm releasing it open-source because I genuinely believe in sharing tools that can empower others. I'd be incredibly grateful if you'd take it for a spin, kick the tires, and let me know what you think. Your feedback at this stage is gold.

The bittersweet feeling of having a home you can never return to, a person you can never turn to, a place you can never visit again. It's in the smell of your mother's morning coffee, and in the school hallways that echo the laughs of the best days of your life. It's in the way the trees swayed as you watched them on that starry October night and it's in the smell of summer riding on the wind. It's in the toys you used to play with as a child, whiling away the hours tangled up in stories of princes and dragons and love and valour. If only the world was that simple, you think. If only, the only thing standing between me and happiness was a dragon, a witch, a prophecy. Nostalgia is funny that way. To long so desperately, to burn so passionately for something you can never have again. To hold in your heart the faded memories of home, of happiness, of love, knowing it is now lost. To reminisce about those memories until they become tinted, glazed with wistfulness, until time blurs the edges like a worn out postcard, like a book that has been adored, like a letter that has been read and reread all too many times. Unattainable, yet cherished. It’s funny how the things you desire the most are the most out of reach, and by the time you realise what you needed was always right in front of you, it is already in the past.

I’d hit snooze three times, grab a coffee, and still feel like a zombie by 10 a.m. Meanwhile, Marcus would show up to our weekend basketball games fully awake, energized, and somehow already on his second breakfast.

**One day, I finally asked him:**

“Dude, how are you always this awake? What’s your secret?”

He just laughed and said,

“I made mornings something I actually like. Not something I survive.”

The 3-Minute Rule That Changed My Routine

Marcus told me about something he called the “3-Minute Rule.” It was simple:

When his alarm goes off, he gives himself exactly three minutes to do one thing he enjoys — music, journaling, stretching, whatever — and that kicks off his day.

He said,

“If I make the first few minutes of my day feel good, the rest usually follows.”

I figured I’d try it out. I set my alarm a bit earlier the next day and played one of my favorite old-school playlists before even getting out of bed.

**It Actually Worked (And I Didn’t Hate It)**

It was wild how much better my morning felt just from those three intentional minutes. I wasn’t scrolling aimlessly on my phone or dragging my feet to the shower. I had a little momentum.

Now I rotate my “3-minute start” — some days it’s music, some days it’s making tea, other days I’ll just step outside and get some air.

It’s not about being super productive. It’s just about starting on your terms.

Marcus Was Right — Mornings Aren’t the Enemy

It’s been a few months, and I actually look forward to waking up now (words I never thought I’d say). I owe a lot of that to Marcus and his casual wisdom.

I’ve used a variety of laundry detergents over the years, but the Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods (model: B099HFZP8Y) quickly stood out in my routine. This product claims to be ultra-concentrated, hypoallergenic, and environmentally friendly, and after testing it daily for weeks, I can confidently say it lives up to most of its promises. As someone with sensitive skin that reacts to artificial additives, these pods have been a lifesaver. I’ve even roped my family into testing them, and the results have been pretty unanimous—impressive cleaning power without any irritation.  

**Effortless Design and Ingredients That Make You Feel Good**  
Unlike bulky detergent bottles, these pods come in compact, recyclable packaging. Not having to wrestle with a heavyweight container makes every laundry day easier. The pods themselves are perfectly pre-measured. Just toss one (or two for heavily soiled loads) into the machine, and you’re good to go. They’re phosphate-free, dye-free, and even animal by-product-free—making them an excellent choice for anyone keen on using cleaner ingredients in their household.  

[Check the Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods B099HFZP8Y price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b099hfzp8y/)  

**Fresh Scent Without Overpowering Fragrance**  
One of the highlights for me is the fresh, subtle scent that lingers on the clothes. I have a love-hate relationship with most detergents because their fragrances make my head spin. These pods don’t overwhelm you, but they leave your laundry smelling clean and natural—nothing artificial or cloying. This was a big win for my partner, who usually finds most scented detergents intolerable.  

**Performance That Surprised Me**  
Given their plant-based formula, I was ready to see average cleaning results, but they genuinely wowed me here. Even my toddler’s mud-streaked pants came out clean after one wash. Coffee stains, food spills, and everyday grime didn’t stand a chance. Admittedly, for deeply set-in stains, like grease, I had to pre-treat the fabric before using these pods. However, the overall cleaning performance rivals, if not beats, most chemical-laden detergents I’ve used before.  

**Merits**  
- Super gentle and suitable for sensitive skin.  
- Convenient, compact, and recyclable packaging.  
- Free from harsh chemicals like phosphates, parabens, and ammonia.  
- Excellent stain-fighting power for regular messes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles slightly with grease stains unless pre-treated.  
- Limited to standard scents—no unscented option for purists.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing Clean People Laundry Detergent Pods to similar brands like Dropps or Tide Hygienic Clean Pods, there are notable differences. Dropps also focuses on eco-friendly packaging, but their cleaning performance didn’t quite measure up to Clean People’s pods when tested on tougher stains. Tide Hygienic Clean Pods have an edge in stain removal, especially for oil-based stains, but they rely on synthetic additives, which is a no-go for sensitive skin or those wanting a cleaner formula. Clean People hits the sweet spot between efficacy and environmental awareness.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the convenience, ingredient transparency, and cleaning power these pods offer, they provide solid value. While other eco-friendly detergents can tip into the expensive side (and let’s face it, not all of them work), this product balances performance and cost well. Its 96-pod count means you won’t be running to the store every few weeks, which saves both money and headache over time. For me, it’s a practical upgrade for my household chores lineup.

The only detail we’re still working through is shipping.

Right now, we already subsidize shipping for subscribers either to a flat rate or around $5. But actual shipping costs are closer to $6–$7, especially for customers outside the Midwest, South, or East.

Here’s the challenge:
The Deep 27 + filter bundle adds bulkiness 10–15 oz and we would need a box (we ship subs in flat pack). 

That pushes the package to nearly a full pound, which triggers DIM weight pricing. That could increase shipping by another $5 per box and we’d be eating that entire cost on both the hardware and the shipping. (Because subscriptions have flat rate shipping cost)

So we’re working on a simple redemption process where customers (you) just pay the shipping cost directly. That way, you still get the Deep 27 + filters for “free”, and we don’t get crushed on fulfillment.

Currently 35 weeks pregnant and we are NC with my MIL currently due to how much she has hurt us. He partners mother texted me asking to let her know when baby is born. While I appreciate her reaching out as she is so sweet, I just don't think we will be doing that as ik it's going straight to MIL. 

I am getting frustrated because the last talk I had with MIL was via text where I explained everything and instead of responding like a normal person she texted a Bible quote that was nonapplicable to the situation. (To explain what happened in short, she has thrown coffee on me while pregnant with my first, over stepped over and over again with our child, lied about us to family repeatedly, lied about my family to others, vaped while holding our NB, Kissed our NB when asked not to, called herself ""mama,"" to baby, and made fake accounts to harrass me with). 

Since then we have had very sparse messages from her, but if she sends any it's to let us know she sent something for our first born (mainly books). 

Her mom (my GMIL) also texted me wishing me a happy mother's day to which I wrote back to her thanking her and wishing her the same (no text from MIL). She asked for photos of our first born so I sent some, and she asked if she can send them to MIL, which I replied to her stating ""I figured you would like to, I don't have an issue with that."" (GMIL also does not know why we are NC with MIL.) MIL had painted herself the victim of ""idk why they won't talk with me."" And my husband and I don't really want to tell GMIL our side of things as she is older and I really don't want to stress her out. 

GMIL also texted my husband telling him that he should be wishing his mom a happy mother's day. He ignored the text as he is still upset with MIL and doesn't want to respond telling GMIL why he wouldn't be doing that, as I stated before she is older and he did not want to add more stress to her. She had texted him that his mom was so upset and missed him so much. 

It is getting very annoying at this point as MIL is doing EVERYTHING, aside from acknowledging her actions and apologizing for them. She has put me through literal hell when I was postpartum with my first and I would still be willing to forgive her if she just wrote an actual apology. It drives me up a wall she is getting elderly people involved trying to have them get information from us when she is very capable of asking herself. 

At first I thought ""maybe it's just us,"" but when I talked with a sibling of hers they equated her emotional intelligence to that of a 12 year old. We even talked with my BIL who agreed MIL was in the wrong with everything. When she calls him asking why we don't talk with her he tells her ""you know why they don't, they have told you.""

**What is it?** Adesto is a super simple menu bar app that simulates tiny mouse movements to keep your Microsoft Teams status active when you step away from your computer.

**Why I made it:** Working remotely, I got tired of constantly appearing ""Away"" on Teams whenever I needed to grab coffee or think away from my desk. My manager would message me the second I went yellow, so I built this to keep me green!

**The journey:** Learning Swift and SwiftUI was definitely a challenge - I spent way more hours Googling basic stuff than I'd like to admit and using Claude for some issues I couldn't solve. The biggest headache was figuring out how to create a proper menu bar app (NSStatusItem was my nemesis).

**What I learned:**

* SwiftUI is amazing once you get past the initial confusion
* Making something small but complete is really satisfying
* Setting up Gumroad was surprisingly easy (though marketing is HARD)

This was my first attempt at not just building something, but actually releasing it and attempting some basic marketing. I have no clue if anyone will buy it, but honestly I'm just proud I finished something!

**Questions for you all:**

* Any advice for someone chasing that first sale of ANYTHING?
* What was your experience putting your first app on a marketplace?
* Any feedback on making something so small worth paying for?
* Any and I mean any marketing and sales tips are so \*\*\*\* welcome pls do share..

Long read....Grab Some Coffee,"I'm a '45M' and an Over The Road Truck Driver who recently started talking to my Ex G/F '44F' again after being separated for 6 months.  We've known each other since we were kids. I know how she grew up and vise versa. With all that in mind.
 
I caught her in a lie and even when she was telling me about the lie I gave her every opportunity to be truthful with me. I made light of it ""even thinking in my head"" I know she is lying. I questioned her about it because what she was saying was so obviously a lie I let her continue telling me about it. 

We said our good nights. Since I'm out of state working we hung up the phone and I couldn't get what she was telling me out of my head. So I dug didn't have to dig very deep to find out the truth. And after finding out the truth this is what I messaged her. 

I wanted to post the screenshot but I just copied and pasted it to the post. As follows:
Text to her.
Do you know what doing the right thing consist of? I always ask myself in situations if I did the right thing or not. And I'm not talking about the right thing for personal gain. I'm talking about the right thing that will effect everyone around me. It could be something as simple as returning someone's phone or wallet if they dropped it. Or in a situation that puts me in a negative light to someone. Even if I tell a lie or steal something I always reflect on it and then I will either admit to my lie if that's what I did. Or I return what I stole. More times than not because I practice this for so long it becomes natural I always end up doing the right thing sometimes I don't and then I question myself but usually I do the right thing whether it's morally or just in general

Text to her:
Practice that's what's important. I'm not going to meet my creator and have all these injustices that sends me to hell. I can show improvement and I can show my attempts at doing the right thing. 
If you know the difference between right and wrong. Then you or anyone an easily self reflect and correct things that have been wronged by yourself. The hard part is swallowing your pride and taking the punishment. But in general you always feel better internally for doing the right thing no matter the punishment 

Text to her:
I live by my words. My words are not just words. My words are wisdom taughtto me by my grandma Mina (my dad's mom) and my grandma Applegate RIP and that's learned wisdom that has played a vital  roll in me growing as a man.
I'm passing this to you because I know you didn't have that father roll model in your life as a kid who should a been there teaching you things like this
I'm not sure if I went about that the right way or not either you're going to never talk to me again or you're going to take what I'm saying as what it is which is me expressing my heart and disappointment over being lied to and trying to help you grow as a woman and become a better person not saying you're a bad person I'm saying a better person someone could be a great person but there's always room to be better.

Text to her:
I told you. No matter what I will never give you bad advice or lead you in the wrong direction. Because by doing that I'm just leaving myself down that path with you because ultimately what I say and do with you affects me and everyone else around me it doesn't directly impact myself and even if it did I still would never ever give you bad advice.
Besides all that I was pissed off last night when I found out you lied to me but I slept on it and I thought about this morning and I realized I need to seize this opportunity to share my experiences with you and maybe get you to realize what growth looks like. I'm not saying your dumb or stupid. I'm saying that your personal experiences with it I know have always been negative. It may have been a negative situation but I'm trying to turn it into a positive.

So good morning I love you and just know I will never ever do anything to hurt you I'm only out to help you and bring you up I will never bring you down.

I guess text or call when you wake up.
Maybe you will or maybe you won't read my messages. If you don't read them your only hurting yourself and missing a chance at growth.

I first took her out in 2013 for coffee however she was always turning me down every few months when I tried asking her out.  I probably took her out a total of 4-5 times from Jan 2013-June 2016.

We finally started seriously dating in December 2016 she proposed to me a few weeks later (Jan 2017). Broke up with me when I refused, told me to never contact her again unless I married her, she cried really hard. She did this several times till she said it was the final time. She regret it a few days later and asked to get back with me. But I didn't know what to do. Would it just end with her getting even more hurt and crying in my bed for hours again?

My mother had issues with her. She only started dating me in December and told me I didn't love her because I didn't get her Christmas presents. Which I ended up doing because I felt inadequate and wanted to make her happy. The other was the marriage thing and talking about moving out with me.

I am assuming she felt if she left me because I didn't marry her that I would also cave and marry her? But the issue was I think she was previously engaged and ""in love"" with someone just 3 months prior, which made me believe she didn't truly love me.

Another thing I noticed at the time was she was wearing a golden ring on her right ring finger and sometimes on her left.

I got in touch with her again after over 3 years. She was very apprehensive at first and hurt. It seems she immediately wanted to get back together. But I told her I would need time to be ready for marriage, she said it was okay.

Then her new ultimatums were about me not telling my mom we were not back together. It was a mistake, but it was 2020, covid and my mom was deathly afraid of it, it was difficult to bring someone over that she disliked and what felt like was endangering her life. She didn't like that I was secretly seeing her but I told her I'd eventually tell my mom.

After a few months.  The issue was she told me she cheated on me and then started asking for an open relationship repeatedly. She also stormed out of the airbnb a second time without saying a word to me. I tolerated it for awhile but I broke up with her. When I did this again she begged me not to do it said she lied and made it up to get leverage and for us to go back to normal.  She told me because I didn't tell my mom I was back together with her she felt like we had nothing.  She told me she completely lost her mind when we first broke up and her love never stopped.

But I wasn't ready to tell my mom because I was afraid that she was gonna do something like this and then my mom wouldn't approve it ever again.

She told me she wanted to remain friends. We talked sporadically.

A year later she told me it was my fault for not telling my mom and for not wanting to marry her. Told me I was a liar. When she sent this message she was dating someone else.

A year after that she told me I was ugly. When I tried reaching out.  She was also dating someone else when she sent this.

A year after that (present day) she reached out but later deleted her messages. But then blocked me, i didnt realize I got the messages until a week later, because I wasnt expecting her to reach out.  She's clearly single.

I still love her and think about her all the time. Should I have just married her prematurely?  I regret it everyday because I've had strong feelings for her for nearly 20 years",0,1747232661.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

I’ve posted several times here before about quitting caffeine. This time I’m really serious about it because I’m not working and I don’t really have any excuse to drink it. It’s been messing up my body for the last 4-5 years, and I need a good long break from it. I’ve been really good about it this time and not even been doing decaf coffee or tea. 

My main concern is that I’m feeling so dried out overall. My face, lips, and eyes get so dry right now. I’m drinking a ton of water, so I don’t really get why it’s affecting me this much. Sometimes my eyes get so dry that I have to just lie down and rest them for a bit. I’m also dealing with a bit of reflux, but I can’t say it’s any more than what I had before.

1kmgfgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1kmgfgu/torn_between_a_promise_and_what_is_best/,Torn between a promise and what is best.,"I posted about a week ago that my wife got her timeline which was 3-6 months (stage 4 renal carcinoma but it's already to every major organ and her brain). We left the ER after almost 4 days and the first day back she was almost back to her old self. I believe it was the huge dose of steroids that helped as she had some edema in her brain.

Over the past week she has been declining again and much faster. She can barely walk anymore so to get her to the bathroom i have to pick her up, get her to a rolling chair, wheel her to the bathroom, get her on the toilet, clean her up and the get her back to the bed. This is an hourly thing. Sometimes every 30 mins, she feels the need to pee and while sometimes it's a lot other times it's either nothing or just a tiny bit. In her brain no matter how full her bladder is when she feels something she needs to go. 

Just under a month ago she was moving around with her cane and could manage to do everything herself. Then she had to switch to her walker and now she can't even use her legs enough to walk with that.

Yesterday morning she woke up and was sort of delirious and her aphasia was quite bad (one of the brain lesions is right next to her speech center). When I was trying to get her to the bathroom we have a routine of the one two three and lift thing. This time she didn't hear three and got scared when I lifted her. She got pissed at me and started pushing me away and speaking gibberish (although in her mind the words were coming out correctly).

Finally I got her to calm down enough to let me get her back to the living room. I have set things up in there like a bedroom since she feels claustrophobic in the bedroom for some reason now. Thing is the steroids they gave her caused her to build up a large amount of water in her low legs and feet. They are so swollen water is actually being forced through her pores. I told her she needs to lie down and keep her legs elevated so the fluid can get where is belongs and her body can get rid of it. She refused and the started getting mean again and just organizing things on the coffee table and knocking things over in the process.

I contacted her palative care nurse to see if she could stop by and check in on her as she might listen to someone other than me since she is pissed off at me. She told me to call 911 and get her to the ER if she is acting delirious.

I did and we have been here all night waiting to be transfered to her hospital. The thing is I promised my wife that I wouldn't let her die in the hospital and she made me promise she would be able to pass at home when the time came. I swore to her that I would make sure that she would be home. The thing is her daughters, her nurse, and my sister who is psychiatric nurse keeps telling me I should ask to have her admitted to the hospital because I am probably going to drop dead from the lack of sleep and stress.

I don't have any help, it's just me looking after her and I don't know how much longer I can survive on an hour of sleep a day while hauling her back and forth to the bathroom every 30 mins to and hour. The nurse said she could put in a catheter but she refused.

My sister keeps telling me that after being a nurse for 20 year (she works with the elderly exclusively) that she has seen more people destroy themselves trying to take care of someone at home when they really should have been admitted to the hospital for hospice.

I am so torn. I don't want to break a promise to my wife, one that I know really mattered to her at the same time I don't have the skills or the energy to take care of her. It would be one thing if she was just weak but was able to walk. It would be another thing if she could communicate to me but half if what she says is gibberish.

I haven't even slept in three days because I am so stressed out. When she is in the bed I put my arm on her or press my back right up against her that way any movement she makes will wake me up. I am worried she will try to get up and go to the bathroom herself and fall flat on her face.

Then there is part of me that is wondering if this is just my ego not wanting to believe I am failing my when she needs me the most and I should be stronger. I am just so tired to the point where I will just start crying for no reason at all.

Even now in the ER the nurse told me I need to keep my wife awake as much as possible and breathing deeply (she's on oxygen right now). It makes me wonder what would happen if I wasn't here with her. Even the ER nurses are using me to monitor her and I can barely keep my eyes open.

I guess this is more of a rant than anything. Hopefully things will get better once we get transfered over to her hospital with her team of doctors. Transfer has been approved so we are just waiting for an ambulance to be available.",2,1747232524.0,CaregiverSupport,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1

It was one of those bright spring mornings in downtown L.A. where the sun worked overtime, but the streets still smelled like last night’s sins. Tom Hart, Private Eye, settled in behind his scarred desk, nursing a cup of black coffee so thick it could’ve passed for motor oil — and it kicked just as hard.

The intercom on his desk buzzed, a harsh sound that broke the stillness.
“Miss Zelda Glass here. Says she needs to talk. New client,” said his secretary, Beth, her voice flat with routine.

Tom grunted. “Okay, send her in. We’ve been slow this month.”

A moment later, Beth pushed the door open and ushered Zelda inside. The dame was a knockout — tall, blonde, and built like trouble. The kind they called a bombshell in the papers, and with good reason. But she wasn’t selling flirtation today, much to Tom’s disappointment. She had business in her eyes — cold, sharp business.

She sat down across from him, crossed her legs just so, and got right to it.
“My manager at the Bunny Hop Club, Greg Audrey, sent me. Two of our bouncers got knifed in the last couple of weeks. Cops say it’s random, but Greg knows better.”

Tom leaned back, eyes narrowing. “Go on.”

“There’s this guy — Teddy Prego. Runs with the Scallisi crowd. He started dealing cocaine at the club, peddling to the high-rollers. Greg had his boys — Mike and John — run Teddy’s dealers out. Banned ’em from stepping foot in the place again.” She paused, her voice tightening. “Next thing you know, Mike and John get stabbed. Same blade, same M.O.”

Tom let that hang in the air a beat. He’d heard of Teddy Prego. A small-time hood with big-time ambition, running with a crew called the Wilshire boys. Young punks with more knives than brains — but dangerous all the same.
“This ain’t chasing down a cheating husband or shaking up some crooked lawyer,” Tom muttered. “These fellas play rough. Real rough. Bodies tend to pile up around them.”

Zelda didn’t blink. “Greg’s willing to pay a thousand dollars a month. Long as he sees progress. He figures this is more than just stabbings — says Teddy’s testing the waters. Seeing how soft the club is before moving in for real extortion.”

Tom rubbed his chin, thinking it over. A grand a month was serious money, enough to make a man forget his better judgment.
“A thousand, huh? That’s hard to walk away from,” he said, eyes flicking down as she shifted and crossed her legs again, flashing just enough thigh to remind him she wasn’t here for charity.

They shook on it. Her hand was cool, steady.
“Give me everything you’ve got on this Teddy and his crew,” Tom said. “Names, faces, places. I’ll start asking around.”

Zelda nodded, already reaching into her purse.
And just like that, Tom Hart was in — neck-deep before his coffee even cooled.

Chapter 2

Teddy Prego sat in the storefront club on Wilshire Boulevard, beneath a faded sign in the window that warned: Members Only. The Wilshire Crew, as they were known, was made up of seven childhood friends. Teddy was the undisputed leader. Second in line was Tony Dietz — an athletic fat guy with a high forehead and hair that nearly brushed his shoulders. Next was Stevie Dog, short but muscular, a self-taught street fighter who mimicked Bruce Lee’s moves with dangerous precision. Tommy Runyon was the shoot-first, talk-later type. Then there were Frank Smitt and Bobby Torre — the crew’s hitters — and Andy Adonis, who ran alongside them.

Frank and Bobby weren’t hotheads like the others. They didn’t start trouble. But given an order to take care of someone, they were ice cold and lethal. It was Frank and Bobby who’d stabbed the two bouncers at the Bunny Hop Club.

Violence was their business model. They made their money the hard way — robbing jewelry stores, pulling home invasions, knocking over small banks. On the side, they had local kids slinging marijuana in the park — that was more Tony, Stevie, and Tommy’s racket.

The crew were associates of the Los Angeles Scallisi family. Their sponsor was Anthony Spina, an old-school captain who kept them earning and under his wing. When Spina gave an order, it wasn’t a request — it got done, no questions asked.

Teddy Prego had bigger dreams. He wanted to be straightened out — made. He kept dropping hints to Spina, but so far, no dice. Patience wasn’t Teddy’s strong suit. He figured that when Spina sent them after the junkie who’d jacked his sister’s car at gunpoint — and Teddy personally put a bullet in the guy’s head — that would be his moment. His button. His bones made. But still… nothing.

The money kept flowing, the Scallisi name kept the heat off, and Teddy knew better than to push Spina too hard. One wrong move and Spina might take it as disrespect — and that was fatal.

So, for now, it was status quo. Patience.

But Teddy had a new angle in mind: expansion. Protection, extortion — the kind of racket that brought in steady, fat envelopes. That’s why they’d started leaning on Greg Audrey, the manager at the Bunny Hop Club.

Spina wasn’t thrilled that one of the bouncers — Mike — was still in the hospital, clinging to life after the stabbing. But this new venture had potential. Real money. Enough to finally make Teddy’s dream a reality.

And Teddy Prego was betting big that this time, he’d come out on top.

Chapter 3

Tom Hart sat in his car across the street from Teddy’s club, snapping pictures as the boys drifted in and out. He had a contact—Billy Yarns, a marijuana distributor on Wilshire—who supplied the Crew with the weed they sold in the park. For fifty bucks, Billy gave Tom all the names and jobs of the members. Tom followed up with some old LAPD buddies, who dug into their records. Other than some small-time busts and a couple of stints in county, there was nothing much. Clean enough on paper.

He worked the merchants on the block, too, but none would say they were being shaken down. Either they were too scared to talk, or the Crew hadn’t made their move yet.

Tom’s next play was to show up at the club tonight, start asking around. Maybe he could smoke out an eyewitness to the stabbings—someone who could match Frank or Bobby to the attack. It was a long shot, but it was all he had.

His stomach growled. It was 2 p.m., and he hadn’t eaten yet. He pulled into the Sun and Moon Diner for lunch, took a seat at the counter, and ordered a corned beef on rye. He made light flirtation with the waitress, just enough to pass the time. Afterward, he drove over to the Bunny Hop Club. It was busy for an afternoon—probably why Teddy was so eager to get his hooks into the place.

Tom spotted Zelda and walked over. She’d started here as a dancer, worked her way up to hostess. But Greg, the manager, saw beyond the blonde beauty—he trusted her, counted on her like an assistant. She carried herself like somebody in charge.

“Tom. What brings you here?” she asked.

“Nothing solid yet,” Tom said. “Got my arms around the Crew’s roster and history, but I still need a way to pin Frank and Bobby to the assault.”

“Come with me. I’ll introduce you to Greg.”

She tapped on an office door marked Manager and led Tom inside. Greg was on the phone but hung up quickly.

“Heard good things about you, Tom. Got a friend in the LAPD—soon as I mentioned my problem, he told me you were the guy to call.”

“Well, it’s definitely a problem. I’m coming back tonight, see if I can flush out an eyewitness. Pretty sure it was Frank or Bobby who stuck your guys.”

“Yeah, those rats. Never had trouble like this before,” Greg muttered. “I know what’s coming next—they’ll lean on us for monthly payments. I’m hoping you can come up with something solid, pin this on Teddy and the Crew, get them put away. Otherwise, they’ll bleed us dry before we’re forced to close the doors.”

“Not if I have anything to say about it,” Tom said.

The phone rang again. Zelda answered, then handed it to Greg. “Hospital. They want to talk to you.”

Greg listened, his face turning dark. “Okay. I’ll be right there.”

He hung up, jaw clenched. “Mike died. They couldn’t save him. It’s murder now. I’m sorry, Zelda.”

Zelda went pale. Her posture stiffened, but her face held steady. There was more between her and Mike than she’d let on.

She turned to Tom, voice tight. “We were engaged. Mike was leaving the club to join the fire department. This was supposed to be his last week. Now he’s gone.”

Her voice cracked, but she caught herself—like she refused to give Teddy the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Tom nodded grimly. “The stakes just got raised. Now we take this to another level.”

Chapter 4

Tom called the precinct—the same one he once worked out of before retiring. He asked for Homicide Detective Steve Foley. The two had grown tight since Tom left the force and had helped each other out more than a few times.

“What now?” Steve said, feigning annoyance.

“Don’t be so happy to hear from me,” Tom joked, then shifted into business.

“Listen, Steve—the hospital just called. One of the bouncers from the Bunny Hop stabbing didn’t make it. The manager’s paying me to pin it on Teddy Prego and his Wilshire Crew. Bunch of young punks trying to get noticed. The manager’s convinced they’re about to muscle in for protection money. Their sponsor, Anthony Spina, was already nervous when the kid was in the ICU. Now that it’s murder? He’s gotta be sweating.”

“What do you actually have tying it to the Crew?” asked Steve.

“Nothing hard. Yet. But Teddy had his guys dealing coke to high-end customers at the club. The manager got wind and had his bouncers—John and Mike—bounce them and ban them. Couple weeks later, they get stabbed. LAPD’s treating it like two separate, random assaults. But now that it’s murder? You’ve got leverage. You lean on Spina. Hit him where it hurts. Make him handle it himself.”

“You sound like you’ve got skin in this game,” Steve said. “What’s the angle?”

Tom hesitated a beat. “Manager’s assistant brought me in. Classy dame—smart, beautiful. Turns out she was engaged to the bouncer who just died. Kid was set to join the LAFD. That was supposed to be his last week at the club. She wants justice. So do I.”

Steve let out a breath. “The captain already looped me in. Said if it turned into a homicide, I’d be handed the case. Guess here we are. Meet me at the hospital—we’ll talk it through, figure out the best way to put the screws to Spina.”

Chapter 5

When Tom walked into UCLA Medical Center, he saw Steve already there, sipping from a vending machine coffee.

“Tastes like hot sweat with sugar,” Steve muttered, then chucked the cup into the trash.

“I spoke to the doc,” he continued. “Wound went septic two days ago. They hit him with heavy antibiotics, but the infection was too far gone. That’s what finished him.”

“Yeah. The papers are going to run it front page,” Tom said. “I slipped the Teddy Prego–Wilshire Crew angle to a couple of reporters I keep warm, plus the engagement story. They ate it up. Got the public howling for justice. Teddy’s little empire just had a match dropped on it.”

“Good work. Press’ll be sniffing around the precinct. I’ll toss ‘em more red meat—make Teddy look like a monster. Raise his profile higher than a flag on a pole. Spina won’t like the heat. Might even throw Teddy to the wolves.”

Steve took a breath and added, “Nothing more we can do here. Meet me at Spina’s club on Highland, 1 p.m. tomorrow. That gives him all morning to stew over the headlines.”

The next morning, Tom hit the YMCA. He pounded the heavy bag for an hour, worked up a sweat, showered, then grabbed a coffee and buttered roll from a deli along with the LA Times.

There it was—top headline:
Teddy Prego, Scallisi Associate, Suspected in Bouncer Murder

Just what Spina didn’t want.

—
1:00 p.m. Sunny LA. Steve and Tom barged into Spina’s club, two uniformed cops in tow.

Steve flashed his badge. “Everyone out—except Spina. You can wait on the sidewalk with the officers.”

“You got no right pushing my people around,” Spina barked.

“Maybe not,” Steve said with a smirk, “but I could have those two uniforms drag you to the precinct—press’ll be waiting outside with cameras. Your call.”

Spina gritted his teeth. “I was expecting this. What do you want?”

“I want Teddy Prego off the board. And I want your help making that happen. UNDERSTAND? And to drive the point home—right now two of your brothels are being raided. So are your bookies. You’re getting squeezed until this gets done.”

Spina, old-school Mafioso, didn’t flinch. He locked eyes with Steve and saw it wasn’t a bluff. The Crew had been good earners. But now they were more trouble than they were worth.

“I’m a businessman,” Spina said evenly. “I don’t need this kind of heat. I’ll shut them down. Fast.”

“Good,” Steve said. “Let’s go, Tom. I think Mr. Spina got the message.”

Chapter 6

Spina didn’t waste time.

One of his men got the message to Teddy: Be at the club in an hour. All of you.

When Spina’s car pulled up outside the Crew’s storefront, it was like the Grim Reaper arriving—tall, old, slender, radiating finality. Inside, he found them waiting. Teddy stood out front. He already knew what was coming.

“I’ll make this short and sweet,” Spina said. “You’re done in this city. I’m giving you a break—leave L.A. I don’t care where you go, but you can’t stay here. That detective Foley shut me down because of you. You’re bad for business. Am I clear, boys?”

They all murmured yes.
All but one.

Spina’s eyes narrowed. “Am I clear, Teddy?”

“No, you’re not clear,” Teddy growled. “You lousy fink. I was your big earner and you turn on me like this? You could’ve straightened me out. Made me. Instead, you shank me in the back and call it a favor.”

Spina shook his head. “Dumb.”

Then Teddy did the unthinkable—he shoved Spina. Put hands on his boss. Then turned and walked out.

Spina didn’t say a word. He got back in his car and disappeared into the city.

Within hours, Frank and Bobby—who’d stabbed the Bunny Hop bouncers—turned up dead, their bodies dumped in separate alleys, a bullet between the eyes.

The rest of the Crew scattered. They’d been allowed to leave town—an offer they took without hesitation.

But Teddy?

Teddy vanished. His apartment was untouched, clothes still hanging in the closet. He’d left it all behind.

He wasn’t running. He was planning.

Plotting revenge.

He hated Spina, sure—but that was just business. The real hatred was reserved for Greg Audrey and Tom Hart. The manager and the private eye. They were the ones who ruined everything. Tore down his Crew. Killed his future.

They were the reason his name meant nothing now.

He’d make them pay.

He’d carve it into their skulls.

Chapter 7

The Bunny Hop club was packed that night. The dance floor pulsed, drinks flowed, and laughter filled the air. The club was famous for its scantily—though tastefully—clad dancers, women who knew how to command a room without saying a word.

At 2 a.m., the club closed. Greg Audrey sent the staff home. The lights dimmed. The place grew quiet.

Tom’s secretary had left his office at 4 p.m. He came in around midnight, catching up on a case. But when he opened the door to his office, he froze.

Teddy Prego was waiting behind the desk, gun in hand.

“You’re gonna pay for what you did to me, cop,” Teddy said, his voice low and shaking with rage. “We’re gonna sit tight for a while. Then we pay a visit to your client Audrey after the Bunny Hop closes. They’re gonna find you both dead together. After that, I take care of Spina. Then I disappear.”

Tom didn’t say a word. He was lucky Teddy hadn’t already pulled the trigger. He wasn’t about to test his luck now.

Around 2:30 a.m., they left for the Bunny Hop. They got there just after three. The club was dark, mostly silent—except for the sliver of light glowing under Greg’s office door. Inside, Greg was at his desk going through the night’s ledger, same as always.

Teddy shoved Tom through the office door and barked, “Behind the desk. Next to him.”

Greg’s eyes went wide with fear. He hadn’t expected Teddy—Steve had figured he’d skipped town.

“So I got you two together,” Teddy slurred, coke and liquor thick on his breath. “So I can kill you together. So they find you dead together.”

He raised the gun.

Suddenly, the lights went out.

Tom’s instincts kicked in. He dove at Greg, taking them both to the floor just as a shot rang out overhead.

Then—silence.

The lights snapped back on.

Teddy stood stiff, frozen in place. His eyes stared upward, blank. The gun hung loosely from his hand. Then he fell—face first—dead.

Behind him stood Zelda.

She never worked late. Not usually. But tonight, something told her to stay. Call it instinct. Call it fate.

She’d come upstairs when she heard Teddy’s voice. And when she saw him holding the gun—about to take Greg from her, too—she acted. She grabbed the switchblade she kept in her purse, the same kind Teddy had used to stab Mike. She hit the light switch, stepped behind him, and drove the blade deep into his back.

He never saw it coming.

Steve Foley and two officers burst in moments later, guns drawn. Zelda had called from the hallway after slipping out unnoticed.

“We’re good,” Tom told Steve. “Everyone’s all right.”

Zelda left with the officers, adrenaline draining fast, her hands shaking as the weight of it all began to settle in.

Steve looked down at Teddy’s corpse. He put an arm around Tom’s shoulder and said, “Sometimes karma solves what the law couldn’t.”

1kmgde7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kmgde7/my_four_horsemen_and_the_devil_who_watched_it_all/,My four Horsemen and the Devil who watched it all happened.,"Hi there. 36mtf Trans woman. 

Came out about a couple years ago but this morning I had a bit of a Menty B and Reddit seemed like a good place to get this all out there. I find people don’t mind reading if the story is fucked up. And every time I tell people this in person I’m usually met with shock (and laughter but I’m a performer). 

Growing up in a very small, poor neighborhood. I learned there were all kinds of people with all kinds of interests. When I hit high school I started to dip my toes into fandoms and communities when the early days of the internet and instant messaging were kicking off. 

In my last year of high school. A friend of mine introduced me to the “furry” fandom. Which for me was really cool because I grew up on anthropomorphic animals and was a creative teen so the idea of “cat people with magic” was up there in the ‘cool’ category. 

This led me to meeting the greater furry community. For better and for worse. 

At 36 I can look back and see the red flags. 

But at 16 I was just like ‘I’m hanging with people my age and people older than me and learning so much about media I’ve missed and making friends’ and had major blind spots when it came to the bad apples in the fandom. 

That led me to the FIRST HORSEMAN

IXY
Ixy was a furry who got very close to a very young me. We would chat on MSN messenger late into the night and for a couple of weeks would be affectionate towards me. 

Now I wasn’t sure of my sexuality at the time or my gender identity. I was just a person who saw this person was appreciative and affectionate towards me and I was happy. 

After a few months of travelling to visit him, I spent the night under the pretence of playing DDR all night and watching anime. I went with a friend at the time as a buffer. Because I wasn’t sure if he was intent on his flirting. 

That night. When my friend was sleeping at the foot of the bed. We were watching IDLE HANDS and relaxing when he made the move on me. I honestly didn’t know what to do because while I had a vague knowledge of sex because I had the internet, I was still only 15.

After that night he started to message me, telling me he was being kicked out of his house and needed my help finding him a place. 

I had close older friends who had their own place. (One of which is next) and they took him in because I had also gotten him a job as a night cleaner for the grocery store I worked for. 

In the span of 6 months. He would lose the job, get rehired because I talked to his boss, then quit. All the while taking advantage of me in progressively sexual ways. 

When I would try to refuse he would say things like “I would hate to be mad when it’s just me and your friends”, threatening them so I would comply. 

This ended when one day when we were both in the kitchen, I (16) was confronted with sex when I was able to hold a knife to his junk and threaten him to leave the city. In the period of an hour and a half his friend was at our house moving his stuff out because I didn’t move the knife till he left. 

When he was gone. I stopped meeting up with the local furries I did like because I didn’t trust that I wasn’t going to end up in the same position. I was scared. But I had friends I could lean on…at least…

SECOND HORSEMAN. E

E was a person I met in high school. She was a couple grades older than me but we connected through our love of anime and JRPGS

She dropped out of school and had to move into her own place but we still remained great friends. Often cosplaying some of our favourite characters and with her having her own place this gave me an opportunity to cook and find my love of food. 

This was when I got deep into the anime community. My favourite opportunities were being able to perform 20+ hours worth of panel work over a weekend at anime north in Toronto doing panels that would draw hundreds. If not a times. Hitting 1000+

I would often go to conventions with her. Again because I never understood my own sexuality at the time, I felt genuine love for this woman. All while she pined for a gay aspiring voice actor who seemed to be ignoring her. 

This is one of the times I think I want to toot my own horn. I’m a very social person. 

I was making friends with voice actors to some of my favourite anime and video games, I was performing stand up comedy in front of like minded nerds and getting genuine laughs. I was a liaison for convention guests, giving me year after year instances of stories of having amazing times with these people. 

And because I had friends. They were there with me. 

Now when I talked about Ixy, E was the person who took him in. For her it was another money source to bring down her bills. And she had the space and liked him at the time too. 

When Ixy was threatening them. He was threatening people I genuinely loved and felt I needed to protect. 

And when Ixy was gone. I told her about what he was doing to me, not that he was threatening her life to get it. I didn’t want her to feel bad or scared so I just told her we had a falling out and his friend picked him up. 

After she moved and some years passed, I was dating D (the devil).  And we met up at a coffee shop with some friends. It was there she made a scene where she slapped me across the face and caused the police to be called to the area. 

But it was what she said when she made a scene that ripped my heart out. “I was never really friends with you. You bought groceries for me and cooked for me. I was fucking using you”

Luckily she had fallen out with a lot of her friends so when she slapped me and the police came…she had nothing because everyone was backing me. 

After that. I lost some friends. Either because they were still in her web of influence or because her house was the only point of hanging for a lot of us. But the ones I kept after that all look to her as a part of their past filled with social and financial manipulation.

NOW INTRODUCING. THE DEVIL

Just going to call him D. D was about my age, into all the same music as I did and at the time was someone I thought was really cute. 

After the events of Ixy. I kept to myself and took to block a lot of the furries I hung out with on MSN and AIM because I didn’t know how to discuss what had happened to me. 

After a few months, I saw D on MSN and his username implied he was dating someone new. I unblocked him because now that he wasn’t single, I could be friends. 

We talked for 6 hours straight and by the time we were logging off, he confessed he was in love with me. I was caught. And starting that day, we began what would become a 15 year relationship and marriage. 

He was by my side when the E stuff was going on and was there with me when I felt I was alone. 

Over the period of 3 years we went to conventions together, did panels together, and were pursuing a real relationship. 

About 5 years into our relationship, he moved out of his parent’s place into an apartment with his friend, who would eventually become one of my best friends, and after a discussion. I moved cities to live with them, pursuing a new job and a new life with him. 

We were having a good time because we had friends we could hang with and were living in ‘first apartment’ mode where every weekend was a party. 

Relationship wise we had been comfortable but he was expressing sadness because he was expressing confusion in his sexuality, something I could relate to as I never felt ~sure

He knew I had been with a woman in my past and expressed interest in women sexually. And because I’ve never been sure of my sexuality, I had never had a critical attitude towards sexual activity (fukin if we’re being blunt)

After a long conversation where I consoled him emotionally, I had told him if he were in that position where he would be physical with a woman, he would have my support. 

ENTER HORSEMAN 3- Blondie

Blondie was a girl who was in ‘the circle’

There were offshoots of groups of friends that eventually spawned from the furries who used to hang out before I had stopped going. The two who housed the meets had moved to spend their lives and careers independently and happily together so I couldn’t blame them. 

There was T&S who were two very close friends (would be in our wedding parties) who had a friend. We called her Blondie because frankly. She was a woman with the same name as me. (Born with a gender neutral name)

This seemed to have set something off in D. Because the more she made herself socially in the community, the more intent D was about hooking up with her. 

Now T, a friend who would later live with me and D, was angry about this. Because D didn’t need to hook up with her when he has someone like me already. 

But what I wasn’t seeing was that the feelings D were having weren’t sexual. They were logical. 

He wanted a woman, she was a social nerd like me with the exact same name. For him. She was the perfect upgrade and replacement for the model he already had. And he didn’t shy in making that the vibe. 

D was losing his ability to not make his intentions blatant. He was cheating on me, spending time with her alone, and then, after I expressed concern with the way she was treating others in the community (drama, lies, bs), he basically came out to tell me he wanted to have sex with her. 

T actually was the one who pulled him aside to tell D about Blondie’s propensity for manipulating as she was in the middle of finding out after socially fucking around too much. And he also told D how close he is to losing me. And was that something he wanted?

Blondie was confronted by her fucking around at some point. She left the city, dropped her whole online persona and basically changed her whole identity before we found out she did this again in a whole different city with the furry community. 

When she was gone. It was a rough patch for us. We fought, we worked different hours so when he was sleeping I would be at the gym with my roommate training to be a pro wrestler (I did become one but that’s a whole nother story)

When we did confront the situation. It was close to my birthday. I had made it a tradition to go to Toronto on my birthday and spend some days shopping and seeing things. But when we were going this year, I could tell he was going to propose to me. 

The whole train ride to Toronto, he was reaching into his pockets and looking back to me and I knew he was going to do it. And when we got off the train to union station, he got on one knee, and I said yes. 

Honestly there’s times where if I were watching my life as a television show, this would be the time someone flips a table and taps out of the show. Like if I am the main character to my own story, I’m a dumb bitch 😂

We spent YEARS engaged. Money was never great for us. Independent wrestling, while very emotionally fulfilling, was literally killing me. I injured my back and had to step away after being paired with inexperienced wrestlers doing moves wrong and giving me several concussions. 

I was kind of lost for a bit. Still in pro wrestling circles socially, but I grew up with dreams of being in front of thousands, just talking and performing, but felt like those paths in life were fading. 

I fell into taking pride in my relationship. Making D happy and supporting them in their dreams. They wanted to make music so I took the time to work with them on their music. I am autistic and musically inclined, as well as a graphics designer and marketing professional so I tried to put that behind him to make it work. 

Socially I took a step back and mostly kept to myself and a few close friends. I stopped going to conventions and I stopped watching anime

And sexually. His want to be with a woman had reached the point where he had discussed the opportunity to make our relationship sexually open. 

I am the type of person who knows a lot of people in sexually open relationships who love each other and make it work, so I looked at my relationship as something that could match that energy and I told him yes. 

FOURTH HORSEMAN- Jay

We had decided to do one more furry convention. It was going to be him and me and a friend of his sharing the room. But it wasn’t until I got there I basically learned his intent was to spend the entire weekend with his friend, with the intent on building a sexual relationship. 

That conversation led to him telling me he was having emotional feelings for her as well and that things were going to work out. I trusted him. But i was depressed. 

I thought if he’s out there just fucking why am I laying in bed in my room? That’s when the door diving our room and the adjoining room knocked. When I opened it, there was a tattooed muscular older man in leather and a million dollar smile greeting me and I smiled back. 

We kept the door open for a few hours, talking about ourselves and sharing some drinks before cuddling on a bed. This was when he had asked me what I knew about the BDSM community. 

I was in the community in the Toronto areas socially for a while. Working with meets and charities and pride events. So I knew a lot. 

He said he wanted to train a new submissive, but doesn’t like randos, would rather have something over time. This was when I asked where he was from in the states and he told me Detroit. That’s like a $50 bus ride I told him. 

That weekend I found myself in my hotel room more than anywhere else. Friends I had in the community that were at the con were busy either working for the convention or with their art tables. And my husband (we were married by then. The marriage is a whole PTSD story in and of itself) was with this girl he talked to online introducing her as his girlfriend to people. 

After that weekend. I had a talk with D. 3 hours of me discussing how his want to be with a woman has evolved past sexuality and turned to an emotional outlet and in my mind I was just thinking of all the things I have to do when he dumps me for her. He didn’t though. He presented Polyamory. 

He would have her. 
And I was free to explore the bdsm relationship with Jay. 

This isn’t what I wanted. I wanted to be with my husband. But this felt like a way I could make him happy, and still have him. 

Over time while he was with his girlfriend. I connected more with Jay. As well as the BDSM and Leather communities in the Detroit area. I felt happy because I felt like I was social again. 

Jay had his quirks. He had lived a hard life and had a lot of history in his community. What I didn’t know at the time was that his history wasn’t great. But when I would talk to these people who would bring it up, they would look at me and in a way be thankful that I was in Jay’s life. 

I was there to help him when he competed in title competitions at local bars, talking up judges and being a chatty Cathy among the leather pups in the community. (That was also the night a serial killer hit on me but again. Nother story)

Over the year I was with him…he put me in situations under the context of kink and BDSM without my consent, but because I was out of my own country and I was emotionally wrapped around his finger because my husband was basically done with me for his girlfriend. 

But it was when he wanted to create his own Leather Group that the alarms went off and I had to get out of this. 

He told me his intent was to create a group to help people trying to find community. People who are struggling in their own queer identity could go here and find support and friends. What it actually was, was a chance for him to repair a tarnished reputation among a community of people who see him as an asshole. It was a vanity project for him to make him look like a pillar of the community. 

When I realized that. I ended things. When I got home from the last time I visited, I told my husband I’m not going back to Detroit and that he and her can do whatever they want, I crashed into my bed. And kind of didn’t want to leave. 

That night, my cousins were going to get together at a local bar and my sister invited me and my husband. I didn’t go. My husband did. But I didn’t. 

I was honestly expecting to not be alive by the time he got home. 

But my phone went off, and my sister was calling. Now up until this point, I had never really been open emotionally about the THINGS I’ve done in my life. I grew up being told I’m being dramatic (turns out I was just autistic) a lot so I didn’t want to feel like I was burdening people with my problems. 

I unloaded all my tears during that call with my sister. But even to this day I can’t thank her enough for calling me because it did save my life. It also gave me the understanding that my little sister was actually an adult and I can talk to her like one. 

Things were getting tough. But then…2020 hit. 

THE DEVIL’S FINAL CHAPTER

2020 hit and I was devastated. I was having a mental breakdown out of fear that I would be the death of someone I loved. So I basically secluded myself in my room. 

My ex, was working a fast food job and every day he would come home and spend two to three hours yelling at me about my selfishness while he’s out there working and his girlfriend is in another country. 

At the time, I had just begun trying to find my side to the polyamory and was beginning a relationship with my current girlfriend (and savior lol) and the pandemic made it so they were with me, and my ex hated me for that. 

He didn’t need to tell me. 
The drugs did. 

He came home one day with mushrooms, saying we should all do them because when he did he was so much calmer and I was dealing with a lot of anxiety to which I would’ve done anything to relieve. 

So we all took some. 
After drinking some orange juice and getting them down, it was then he told me he had taken more than a GOD DOSE. something along the 8-11g range. 

He said he was fine and we were relaxing for a bit. Then a heard a crash. Seconds later my husband crashes through the door, blood all up his side, crawling on my bed to grab at my face. After holding his hands back he was yelling at my face “we’re in the bad place. We have to die to go to the good place” and began rolling around my bed, getting his blood on it. Turns out he went to take a shower and fell, hitting his side off the faucet 

He grabbed both my wrists and slapped me across the face before getting up and going to his room. 

I went downstairs to talk to the girlfriend who was gaming (social distancing in the house means gaming systems in different rooms) and that’s when I hear footsteps crashing on the stairs. 

D was trying to run outside…in the nude…and we live in an area where kids play and I’m not dealing with cops. I tackled him, dragged him to his room, threw him inside and used a bungee cord to lock him in his room by tying it to the doorknob and a supporting beam. I called his best friend and he came over to trip sit him after everything that happened. But before he got here I could hear him yelling “I hate you. I want to be in New York with (her)”

After that day. I knew I had to get out of this. This was a man who, while he was there through everything I had been through, was no different than them. He watched others manipulate and use and toss aside and that was just what he wanted to do too. 

He wasn’t going to leave me. He couldn’t. But what he could do is take everything I’ve been through and put it in a light where he’s always there for me. But being there for someone requires supporting them. Something I was doing for him, but not something I deserved in return. 

After years of trying to deny myself, find words to socially frame it, and putting my life aside. I came out as trans. From childhood to adulthood I never felt like a man, I never understood men or understood the privileges I was told I was born with. I spoke to my doctor, a former therapist, and began my journey. 

My husband’s response was “I’ll still prefer real women” and it was done. I emotionally checked out from him and just needed to physically. 

His girlfriend was living in the states, and early into their relationship, I was behind the idea of trying to get her into Canada either through schooling or work so they could be together and spend more time together /so he could be happy/

My ex’s plan was for us to get divorced so he could marry her for the green card. He assumed that I would just nullify our marriage because the relationship would still “count” under the context of polyamory. 

So I told him. We can do that plan. But if we do. He’s out. I can’t continue the relationship if our long engagement and fucktacular wedding was just a tool to immigrate his girlfriend. Shortly after. He moved out and we divorced. 

————-
So this is where I am. I’m about 2 years into my transition and I’m proud of myself for doing something for myself and I’m excited to where my life is going. 

I have a trans girlfriend along with me on my journey and she is beautiful and creative and supportive. 

But I feel so lost. I feel like these horsemen and the devil have so much of my formative years wrapped up in drama and bullshit that seeing through it to what is ahead of me is so hard. 

I want to go back to that social butterfly of a person I was before. Hell I would take the social behaviour of two horsemen in. 

But I’m just…scared if that makes sense. This is the first time I’m really taking the time to write a lot of this out, and this doesn’t even begin to crack the surface of the things I’ve experienced in my life that I haven’t fully processed. 

I want that chance again to be social, to be talkative, to be in front of hundreds or thousands of people helping make them smile. 

But I’m scared. I’m scared of this world I live in where the label of being trans, for some reason discounts what I’ve been through. I’m scared that I’m going to be abused again. I’m scared to put myself out there, even though being out there and learning and growing are things that make me feel good. 

So I wanted to take the opportunity to just. Get this out there. Off my chest before the breasts come in I guess. 

If you read this all. Thank you. Truly thank you. 
This was hard to put into words but I hope if anyone is seeing anything in their lives that I’ve been through, that they can get out before they’re like me. 36 and just…so unsure of the road ahead.

Day 10 of keto. I feel demotivated today. I’m having all these thoughts like ‘I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life’. I don’t want to overthink or second-guess everything that I’m eating. This almost feels like a different kind of eating disorder. I’m logging absolutely everything. I know it’s very early days and at the end of last week I felt great. I really felt like this was sustainable long term. Especially with some of the keto substitutes I could use. I’ve been googling how to make keto dessert to give me a semblance of hope and anticipation. But then I read all these comments about how you best avoid those products. And I get it. Wholefoods are best - obviously. But today I feel like even that little bit of hope and anticipation of having a dirty keto cheatday one day has just kind of, gone.

Today I just feel a little off and full of doubt. I guess I thought it would get better and better instead of up and down.

I love food. I have been overweight most of my life, but never like this. I started dieting when I was 16 and pretty early on I resigned to the idea that I would be on a diet for the rest of my life. At first I needed to lose relatively small amounts of weight, 10 pounds or so. After 3 kids and a bunch of post-pregnancy weight I’m looking at 50 pounds to lose although I’d be fine with 30-40 for now.

Food is something that I look forward to everyday. It’s something that makes me near euphoric. That doesn’t mean I eat like trash everyday. I love veggies, I love fruit (and I miss it a lot!). I like healthy food and the idea of being healthy. I like being active. I just love the idea of possibilities when it comes to food. Of having snacks on a Friday night to ring in the weekend. I need food to enhance my momentary carefreeness, because food is celebration and food is comfort and I don’t have many things to realistically bring me that in my busy life. Something else I love? Coffee. I inhale coffee and pretty much need it for basic functioning. And also, coffee is me-time. But coffee tastes like shit now. And that makes me sad. I’ve been experimenting with coffee and sometimes it tastes less shitty, but it doesn’t hit the same anymore. So now I’m having a knockoff Redbull zero. I know it’s terrible for you and I’m sure plenty of people are judging me right now, but I’m not sure I care right now - because I feel sad.",12,1747232321.0,keto,27,0.83,False

Today, I'm celebrating how far I've come - traveling across time zones for the past two months, handling work stress without neuro symptoms flaring, and finally feeling like myself again.

**My Wins:**  
✅ Enjoying tea, coffee, and alcohol again  
✅ Eating freely without strict bio/low-sugar restrictions  
✅ Regaining 5kg through regular gym sessions (3x/week!) Gym performance back to 70%  
✅ Traveling, walking 20K+ steps, and staying out late  
✅ Tolerating medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs, Chinese herbs)  
✅ Simplifying my routine - no more supplement cocktails  
✅ Feel like myself physically and mentally again

No more living like a porcelain doll, constantly worrying about every little thing.

**Remaining Challenges:**  
• Eye floaters (no improvement)  
• Occasional twinkling sensations/minor neuropathy  
• Mild joint cracking (barely noticeable)  
• Faster fatigue - still need more rest than before

I'll check in periodically with updates, though I'm visiting less often as life moves forward. To anyone in the thick of floxing: recovery *is* possible, don't give up!",6,1747232223.0,floxies,1,1.0,False

But sometimes I’d like to add in  tangible elements, such as specific items.

Some context: I’m brewing an Urban Modern Fantasy setting with surreal elements. Let’s say I want to throw in tangible signifiers (or ‘dream objects’) into Oracle results (e.g. absurd Twin Peaks-like items; creamed corn; a cup of coffee; an owl; you get the point). The point is to force random table results in unexpected directions, but rooted in worldly elements. 

Should I just add a D100 column of objects to an oracle, or are there other, more interesting ways, to go about it?",4,1747232123.0,RPGdesign,3,1.0,False
