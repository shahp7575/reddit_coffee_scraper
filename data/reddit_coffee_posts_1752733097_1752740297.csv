Newest edition is the Kingrinder K6 which I have set to 100 clicks. This seems a little bit courser than my usual grind but trusting the advice I've read on here during months of lurking.

Some Ramblings About That Video Of Lu Jamming 


Just musing on how I made this work. I used do this long ago but stopped.  Talk about my work. Mostly its for me to wrap my head around this weird hobby I have. ü§≠

So‚Ä¶.how did I do this? I started with an edit I had already done, a few months ago (it was posted.) It was a good swap to start with. I believe this one was FaceTool and another app swap, combined in PhotoLeap and then my usual edits through FaceApp, FaceTune, PhotoLeap, YouCam and finished off in Snapseed.  

Months later I decided to run the edit through PhotoLeap‚Äôs Image To Video Generator. Had to do about twelve of those to get two good ones. At this time I was only playing around with the software to see  what it can do. Seems to do guitar playing pretty good if it‚Äôs a tight shot like this. I never posted it because it felt kind of empty. Like there should be music. So it sat in one of my folders for another day. 

After playing around with video swaps (I found software for that) and using iMovie and FCP to edit them, some of which I posted, I thought about bringing that Ai generated video to life (I‚Äôm using that term loosely here, the base image was a photo) My next decision was what song is she playing? Because of the limiting factors of the videos, it couldn‚Äôt be a solo, unfortunately. The footage just wasn‚Äôt there. I tried with Black Sabbath‚Äôs Neon Nights and it just didn‚Äôt work. Was more frustrating to watch than cool if you know what I mean. Had to be the opening of a song. I did one of Faeries Wear Boots and it looked good. Then I went to Maiden‚Äôs Where Eagles Dare. Looked really good. 

So, in film school and in my photography work  I learned that ninety percent of art is problem solving. And digital edits are no exception. The first thing I did was enhance the video. As good as PhotoLeap‚Äôs generation was it was a bit fuzzy.  There‚Äôs this company called Topaz. They make plug ins for desktop photo and video editing apps. Amazing results.  And expensive. The app for photos is called Gigipixel which I have an account for. Unfortunately for me the video one, called Astra, is web based and a separate subscription. I gave it a whirl. Haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôm keeping it or not. With that said, it did an amazing job of cleaning up the image and enhancing her face. That‚Äôs this software‚Äôs specialty.  Face enhancement.  I recommend the photo  version of the app. It‚Äôs amazing. It has a web version called Bloom. Stunning. 

I started out in iMovie (sorry for all you Android or Windows users, my editing software is all iPadOS) mainly because it‚Äôs simple and allows me to import music from my Music App. Final Cut Pro (FCP) doesn‚Äôt allow importing music from the Music App Library, I‚Äôm assuming for copyright issues.  Not sure why iMovie isn‚Äôt an issue, who knows what Apple‚Äôs reasoning is. There is one big annoying problem with iMovie. It crops the image. To get the full image you have to shrink to fit which looks horrible.  I‚Äôve did this before with other videos and just wasn‚Äôt satisfying. What to do. One app allows music and the image will be cropped or the other is perfect but no music ü§® 

I found a loophole and it works. 

I edited it iMovie with the music.  I used both videos, about seven seconds each, with cross fades. I kept placing the images one after the other until the vocals kicked in. That‚Äôs where my cutoff was, I didn‚Äôt want it to sound like Bruce Dickinson was singing, as her band is an all girl band (in my mind Lucrezia sings vocals in her band with some exceptions) In retrospect I should of grabbed the Iron Maidens, the all girl cover band  (yeah it‚Äôs real. Look it up), version of that song if it exists.  Once done,  I exported it to FCP. iMovie has the ability to pass projects off to FCP and it will import video with music.  Next I deleted all the video footage leaving the track of music intact. That‚Äôs the loophole. Then I re added the video pieces again adding FCP‚Äôs crossfades which I think are nicer to work with. Once I had that completed I had to add something up front for the opening drums as I don‚Äôt have a video of Lisa on drums (she‚Äôs the drummer in Lu‚Äôs band.) I decided to add a title card which I made in Adobe Express and imported in. I found FCP‚Äôs text creation tools a bit too complicated for what I needed.  Then it was a bit of fine tuning the length of the time the title card sits and crossfades into Lu. 

Like I said, it‚Äôs not perfect but it looks great for what it is, a short video that a fan captured at a concert.

Years ago when I first started using Reddit, my wife was worried I‚Äôd start talking to other women on here. This compounded with me looking at an nfsw post one afternoon when she surprised me coming home from work. Porn made her feel betrayed and she felt I betrayed her; she‚Äôs reminded me of it continuously ever since and each time I‚Äôve apologized. In response, I elected to stop looking at any graphic content. I set up my Reddit account with the sfw filter and I chose a username I knew would make her feel secure. Flash forward nearly a decade. She lost nearly 200lbs with gastric bypass and has had multiple plastic surgeries since we‚Äôve had children and is physically stunning. We‚Äôve had a rough couple of years because she voluntarily travels for work in excess of 2 weeks a month and has trouble with boundaries with other men. I worried with her lack of boundaries how this would play out and about 3 weeks ago, I found out. We were coming back from my grandfather‚Äôs funeral and she had been extremely distant in an otherwise extremely loving marriage (I thought). I asked her what was going on and she became angry that I was asking. I asked to see her phone (a boundary we‚Äôve always honored) and find multiple sexually explicit text messages in her deleted folder to what I believe is a woman coworker of hers. I confront her about these texts to ‚ÄúA‚Äù and she tells me ‚Äúno it‚Äôs from a smut book I‚Äôm sending to friend ‚ÄòB‚Äô‚Äù. So I look up the contact by name and the name A appears twice. She had changed the name of a male coworker to be her female work friend in her phone so I wouldn‚Äôt notice any texts. I asked her ‚Äúis this the man you‚Äôve been traveling with for work‚Äù she insists no it is not. After a big fight, I agree to work things out the next day under the condition she messages him that they are done and she‚Äôs working through things with me. She agrees and I see his picture in the process: it‚Äôs the guy she‚Äôs travelled with for work. She reluctantly admits but still insists nothing happens beyond these sexts and a couple nudes exchanged. We‚Äôve been together 11 years so I believe her and accept working through this together as she insists it‚Äôs a mistake. My counselor agreed ‚Äúwork through it there‚Äôs so much to lose here it‚Äôs worth seeing through‚Äù. I‚Äôm not perfect and she tells me a lot of behaviors I‚Äôve been doing that made her feel ‚Äúunseen‚Äù, ‚Äúunappreciated‚Äù and ‚Äúunloved‚Äù. In response, I‚Äôve dedicated the last 3 weeks to firing on every love language: making her coffee in bed, packing her lunch every day, writing her notes, writing her poetry, rubbing her feet, arms, back every single free moment we have. I clean from the time I get up until bed because she told me I wasn‚Äôt contributing enough before. I make the bed and buy her flowers every day trying to show her how much I care. I take the kids almost every day and give her time to herself, I have not had time to myself in years, I have them every day. I change every single diaper and wipe every butt during this three weeks. Tonight she is traveling for work and I feel something is off, I check our phone records and she‚Äôs been texting him this whole time, every single day since telling me she had blocked him and was focused on us. She insisted it was just for work, she insisted they weren‚Äôt talking about anything personal and she slipped up and said she was worried she was losing her friend in him and that she had nearly ruined her marriage. During this three weeks she‚Äôs been standoffish. She has been cold at times and loving at others. She spent the night begging me to come back. She spent the night begging me to feel the connection she has and telling me I‚Äôm the one for her. I‚Äôm so fucking broken. I‚Äôm so crushed and betrayed. I have to get our three kids to school and focus on work in 5 hours and all I can think is ‚Äúwhat was ever real‚Äù. And to make

Then it happened.

Just one word. A new message. No context.

He stared at it, confused. The screen name wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt possible.

His chest tightened.

No. It couldn‚Äôt be. Some scammer maybe? Or a cruel joke. Someone using her handle.

He typed quickly, fingers hitting the keys harder than necessary.

shawn.taylor\_82: Who is this?

shawn.taylor\_82: This account belonged to someone who died. Who do you think you are, using it?

He stood up, pacing.

Anger flared in his chest - sharp and familiar.

Just like the day they told him she was gone.

Her vehicle had been hit. Ambushed outside the wire. Right after his unit rotated out.

No survivors.

That‚Äôs what they said.

But first - they took his M16. They asked him to hand it over, calm-like. He hadn‚Äôt even known why yet.

‚ÄúWe just need to hold onto this for a while, Sergeant Taylor.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt want him doing something stupid.

Didn‚Äôt want him grabbing gear and storming out for revenge.

Gave him time to get his head straight - time he never asked for.

The fury that rose then - it hadn‚Äôt left. He‚Äôd just buried it under years of silence.

His hands shook.

nahrain\_dreams2003: Taylor‚Ä¶ wait. Please. Just listen.

Taylor. No one else ever called him that.

He froze, mid-step.

shawn.taylor\_82: Stop this. This isn‚Äôt funny.

nahrain\_dreams2003: It‚Äôs really me. Open the camera. Just‚Ä¶ open it.

He hesitated.

His heart thudded in his ears.

Open the camera?

He moved his cursor ‚Äì hovering just over the icon.

Every part of him said not to. It couldn‚Äôt be.

He‚Äôd buried her. In his mind. In his past.

In the part of him that never really came home.

But his fingers moved anyway.

Click.

The camera flickered to life.

And there she was.

Alive.

Not a dream. Not a ghost.

Just Nahrain.

Older. Damaged.

A curtain of dark hair swept across one side of her face - hiding what the war had taken.

One eye full of tears. The other‚Ä¶ gone.

Breathing. Real.

‚ÄúHey, Taylor,‚Äù she said softly.

He sat down hard, unable to speak.

The room tilted, and all the years between that moment and the last time he saw her collapsed into nothing.

Tears flowed down their faces.

Neither one could talk for a moment - their emotions too high, too raw, too real.

The silence between them said everything.

It took us 12 years to write it - and alot of pain to recall it all but we did it. As she can't see well I read it to her - like many things - and you can imagine how hard that was to edit - both of us crying.. Well - here is the Prologue:

Prologue: The Ping

He hadn‚Äôt touched Yahoo Messenger in well over a year.

His laptop screen glowed in the dark room, casting pale light across the carpet and the half-empty coffee cup on the floor beside him.

Shawn had logged in out of an old habit more than anything - just checking, maybe looking for an old message from someone long gone.

Then it happened.

hello

Just one word. A new message. No context.

He stared at it, confused. The screen name wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt possible.

nahrain\_dreams2003

His chest tightened.

No. It couldn‚Äôt be. Some scammer maybe? Or a cruel joke. Someone using her handle.

He typed quickly, fingers hitting the keys harder than necessary.

shawn.taylor\_82: Who is this?

shawn.taylor\_82: This account belonged to someone who died. Who do you think you are, using it?

He stood up, pacing.

Anger flared in his chest - sharp and familiar.

Just like the day they told him she was gone.

Her vehicle had been hit. Ambushed outside the wire. Right after his unit rotated out.

No survivors.

That‚Äôs what they said.

But first - they took his M16. They asked him to hand it over, calm-like. He hadn‚Äôt even known why yet.

‚ÄúWe just need to hold onto this for a while, Sergeant Taylor.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt want him doing something stupid.

Didn‚Äôt want him grabbing gear and storming out for revenge.

Gave him time to get his head straight - time he never asked for.

The fury that rose then - it hadn‚Äôt left. He‚Äôd just buried it under years of silence.

His hands shook.

nahrain\_dreams2003: Taylor‚Ä¶ wait. Please. Just listen.

Taylor. No one else ever called him that.

He froze, mid-step.

shawn.taylor\_82: Stop this. This isn‚Äôt funny.

nahrain\_dreams2003: It‚Äôs really me. Open the camera. Just‚Ä¶ open it.

He hesitated.

His heart thudded in his ears.

Open the camera?

He moved his cursor ‚Äì hovering just over the icon.

Every part of him said not to. It couldn‚Äôt be.

He‚Äôd buried her. In his mind. In his past.

In the part of him that never really came home.

But his fingers moved anyway.

Click.

The camera flickered to life.

And there she was.

Alive.

Not a dream. Not a ghost.

Just Nahrain.

Older. Damaged.

A curtain of dark hair swept across one side of her face - hiding what the war had taken.

One eye full of tears. The other‚Ä¶ gone.

Breathing. Real.

‚ÄúHey, Taylor,‚Äù she said softly.

He sat down hard, unable to speak.

The room tilted, and all the years between that moment and the last time he saw her collapsed into nothing.

Tears flowed down their faces.

Neither one could talk for a moment - their emotions too high, too raw, too real.

The silence between them said everything.

They were both still here. Somehow.

After seeing a friend playing it, I wanted too. At this time, I was just 18yo, with no credit card. So I ask my parents for a one, then, the first thing I bought with it is Satisfactory on Epic Games.

For my laptop, that was a struggling, so the second thing I bought is 4Gb of DDR3 (going from 4 to 8Gb, yeah I feel old). I played a few hours in that amazing world, but the game was changing too much during updates (from U2 to U3 then U4), I needed to restart almost from scratch everytime so I dropped it for years. In 2022, some friends discovered the game and we started to play in multiplayers, but one was playing days and nights and I didn't enjoy because I was too late about the milestones.

Then, when the 1.0 released, I played it, but with my gilfriend. With time, and after almost 450h, we saved the day. Thanks Coffee Stain Studio for that travel. Now, we are going to start again, better, with more efficiency ! The factory never ends !

Something very out of line though, where i cannot find answers to no matter where i look:

I periodically experience EXTREME fatigue that most of the time lasts for 1-3 days, mostly 2. 
All i can do is sleep, barely being anle to get up for the toilet. 
Nothing helps, no coffee, not my antidepressants, nothing. it feels like i am wrapped in a blanket of steel and a cloud of delirium. 

It mostly happens to me after a lot of bigger social happenings which in general are tasking for me, but sometimes it happens for seemingly no reason.


Now my worries: i dont know if i am valid in that as in, should i research this? should i go to a doctor? im so afraid of not getting taken seriously. Especially as a woman. Everywhere including differents forums where i tried to explain my issues i was judged harshly and told that ""sleeping too much is unhealthy"" like DUH it is debilitating!!! Also, yes i am struggling on and off with depression, but its been quite a few years, and i am better than ever with it and still experience this. This has never been connected to my depression.

Now last week i came back home for 6 days because of family obligations,however i would be in our town just for a couple of days.I asked her about a month ago if she would be free on the day i arrive and she said yes.I also said when i'm back in town and when my flight is.However there was a change and i let her now last week that insted of wednesday i would be back tuesday(my flight is today).We did hang out as soon as i arrived and it was great,and we were trying to think about what to do when i'm back.

On the way back i texted her again and she said that she had plans for that day,but to be honest i was supposed to be back the next day anyway.Then she called me to see what well do,as she had plans for wednesday evening as well and asked if i wanted to tag along.Truth is i didnt as it would be 10other people i dont and did't think it was worth it since i'm in town for so little time.Then she suggested to go for coffee but immediately took it back as it would be too hot.I ended up saying to just drop it and that we can meet in about a month when i'm back.I felt a bit sad then and she could probably tell,as she started calling back and texting after that.
She suggested to meet in the afternoon before her plans and i said sure but then she added""because you got upset"".That really rubbed me the wrong way,like are you doing me a favour??

So yesterday morning i texted that unfortunately i would not be able to meet after all..I explained that i did not see the reason to rush myself as i had a ton to do before leaving(which is true) and that it's no big deal we 'll just meet when i'm back.I also explained that i had informed her a long time ago about the dates i would be here and we could have arranged it better.To that she said she got mixed up.

Now i feel bad for cancelling.I mean,she did not HAVE to hang out with me and it was my own choice to prioritize seeing her over other people,so i could be more chill about it and just go as i really wanted to see her.Also when i re read my messages you could tell i was annoyed..

1m21ew9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1m21ew9/volvo_sold_as_2024_feb_but_produced_in_week_17_of/,"Volvo sold as 2024 (Feb), but produced in week 17 of 2023","We bought a Volvo XC60 B4 in February, transitioned from a lovely SEAT Leon Estate which we bought in 2020.

Reasons for switching to Volvo were safety, and just wanted a cool looking car. The whole buying experience of the volvo select car was really disappointing. Being new to the country and spending 40k on a car, getting no support on registration procedures and admin etc. We didn't even get a cup of coffee whilst sitting down to make the sale. Communication was poor. Not that I am hinging on that, but moving to a more premium brand, the sales experience was less compared to SEAT, VW and Renault. 

The real drama started when the car was delivered. We have two young kids, the sales guy offered some small toy cars, they were never given. The car was supposed to be cleaned (not done), the car had some scratches which were not there at the time of sale (luckily made pictures), had to argue to get them fixed. The attached a metal strip to the back bumber was placed incorrectly and cause dents in the loading hatch. The tank was literally empty when the car got delivered. Appointments at the workplace that were agreed over mail for things to be fixed didn't end up in the system, making me taking hours off from work for nothing. 

Most of it got fixed and resolved, but never really with apologies. I have never experienced such an experience even with less premium cars like the brand I mentioned. 

The car was sold as a 24' model, I explicitly asked if it was a 24' model and if it was manufactured in the same year. This was the case. 

Love the car though, the way it drives, buggy software though, with not a lot of customisation options in the menus compared to other brands. 

Last week software got updated to 3.6.4, unfortunately the Pip functionality was lacking, which made me look into the manufacturer date of the car, which seems to be week 17 in 2023. I understand the long times between production, registration and delivery, but isn't this a bit to far off? 

We are thinking of buying an plus in hybrid or full electrical in 2027 due to moving to a house that is solar powered. But am really doubting after this experience if volvo will make the cut again. ",1,1752738194.0,Volvo,1,0.67,False
1m21eus,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m21eus,The Ultimate Guide to Mock Neck Batwing Sleeve Tops: Your 2025 Summer Style Game-Changer,"Hey there, fashion lover! Let's talk about something that's been absolutely dominating my wardrobe lately ‚Äì **mock neck batwing sleeve tops**. I know, I know, that's quite a mouthful, but trust me when I say these babies are about to become your new obsession. Whether you're hunting for that perfect dressy casual look or need something that screams ""I've got my life together"" for the office, these versatile pieces are where it's at.

## What Makes Mock Neck Batwing Sleeve Tops So Special?

Picture this: you wake up late (again), stare at your closet for exactly 30 seconds, grab one of these tops, and somehow look effortlessly put-together. That's the magic we're dealing with here. **Mock neck batwing sleeve tops** combine the sophisticated elegance of a structured neckline with the breezy comfort of loose-fitting sleeves ‚Äì it's like someone finally figured out how to make fashion both stylish and forgiving.

The mock neck design gives you that polished, professional vibe without the stuffiness of a full turtleneck. And those batwing sleeves? They're basically wearable air conditioning for your arms while adding this gorgeous, flowy silhouette that flatters pretty much everyone. IMO, it's the perfect storm of comfort and style :)

## Why 2025 is the Year of the Loose Fit Summer Tunic

Let me be real with you ‚Äì **2025 fashion trends** are all about embracing comfort without sacrificing style. Gone are the days when we squeezed ourselves into uncomfortable clothes just to look good. The loose fit summer tunic trend is proof that fashion is finally listening to what we actually want: clothes that move with us, breathe with us, and make us look amazing without trying too hard.

These **loose fit summer tunics** aren't just oversized for the sake of it. They're strategically designed to create flattering silhouettes while giving you room to actually live your life. Want to reach for something on a high shelf? No problem. Need to give someone a proper hug? Your top won't betray you by riding up or pulling weird.

The beauty of this trend lies in its versatility. You can throw on one of these tops with skinny jeans for a casual coffee date, pair it with tailored pants for the office, or even wear it as a beach cover-up. Talk about getting your money's worth!

## Decoding the Tie Back Blouse Phenomenon

Now, let's chat about the **tie back feature** ‚Äì this little detail is what takes these tops from good to absolutely genius. Ever wonder why designers keep coming back to this element? It's because tie backs solve multiple fashion problems at once.

First, they give you control over the fit. Feeling a bit bloated today? Loosen that tie. Want a more defined waistline for date night? Cinch it up. It's like having a personal stylist built right into your shirt.

Second, tie backs add this gorgeous detail to the back view. You know that awkward moment when someone compliments your top from behind and you're like, ""Oh, this old thing?"" Well, with a **tie back blouse**, you'll actually have something interesting to show off back there.

The practical benefits are pretty sweet too. These ties help prevent the dreaded ""tent effect"" that can happen with loose-fitting tops. Instead of looking like you're wearing a stylish garbage bag (we've all been there), the tie creates structure and intentionality in your silhouette.

## Styling Your Dressy Casual Tops Like a Pro

Here's where things get fun ‚Äì **styling dressy casual tops** is basically an art form, and I'm about to share some trade secrets with you. The key to nailing this look is all about balance and knowing your proportions.

**For the Office:**
‚Ä¢ Pair your mock neck top with high-waisted trousers or a pencil skirt
‚Ä¢ Add a blazer for extra polish
‚Ä¢ Keep accessories minimal ‚Äì let the top be the star
‚Ä¢ Opt for neutral colors or subtle patterns

**For Weekend Vibes:**
‚Ä¢ Team with your favorite skinny jeans or leggings
‚Ä¢ Throw on some statement jewelry
‚Ä¢ Add sneakers for comfort or ankle boots for edge
‚Ä¢ Don't be afraid of bold colors or prints

**For Date Night:**
‚Ä¢ Try it with a leather skirt or fitted pants
‚Ä¢ Add heels and a clutch
‚Ä¢ Let that tie back detail shine
‚Ä¢ Go for deeper, richer colors

The magic happens when you play with proportions. Since these tops have volume on top, you want to balance that with fitted bottoms. It's fashion math, and trust me, it works every time.

## The Fabric Factor: What to Look For

Not all **mock neck batwing sleeve tops** are created equal, and the fabric choice can make or break your experience. Let me break down what you should be looking for:

**Chiffon and Lightweight Polyester:** Perfect for summer, these fabrics are breathable and flow beautifully. They're also surprisingly durable and easy to care for ‚Äì major win for busy lifestyles.

**Cotton Blends:** Your go-to for everyday comfort. They're soft, breathable, and usually machine-washable without fuss. Plus, they tend to hold their shape well over time.

**Satin and Silk-Like Materials:** These elevate your look instantly and work beautifully for dressier occasions. Just be prepared for a bit more maintenance in the care department.

**Knit Fabrics:** Super forgiving and comfortable, knits are perfect if you're new to the loose-fit trend. They're also great for transitional seasons.

FYI, always check the care instructions before buying. Some fabrics require special handling, and ain't nobody got time for dry-cleaning every single top in their wardrobe :/

## Color and Pattern Game: Making Smart Choices

When it comes to **2025 women's blouses**, color and pattern choices can totally transform your look. Here's my honest take on what works:

**Solid Colors:** Your wardrobe workhorses. Black, white, navy, and cream are classics for a reason ‚Äì they go with everything and always look polished. But don't sleep on jewel tones like emerald, sapphire, or burgundy. These colors photograph beautifully and add richness to your look.

**Prints and Patterns:** This is where you can have some fun! Floral prints are having a major moment, especially for summer. Geometric patterns add a modern edge, while stripes (yes, even on loose-fitting tops) can be surprisingly flattering when done right.

**Seasonal Considerations:** Light, bright colors for summer are obvious choices, but don't overlook pastels and soft neutrals. They photograph beautifully in natural light and pair well with summer accessories.

## Size and Fit: Getting It Right

Here's something that might surprise you ‚Äì **getting the right size in loose-fit styles** is actually trickier than you'd think. These tops are designed to be roomy, but there's a fine line between ""effortlessly chic"" and ""drowning in fabric.""

Most brands design these tops to fit true to size, meaning your usual size should work perfectly. However, I've noticed that some people prefer to size down for a more intentional ""loose"" look rather than an overwhelming one.

The key areas to pay attention to:
‚Ä¢ **Shoulder seam placement** ‚Äì this should still sit at your natural shoulder point
‚Ä¢ **Sleeve length** ‚Äì batwing sleeves should enhance your arms, not hide them completely
‚Ä¢ **Overall length** ‚Äì longer tunic styles should hit at a flattering point on your hips

When in doubt, check the size chart and customer reviews. Real people sharing their experiences are worth their weight in gold when shopping online.

## Care and Maintenance: Keeping Your Tops Looking Fresh

Let's be practical for a hot minute ‚Äì **caring for tie-back blouses** and delicate fabrics doesn't have to be a nightmare. Here are my tried-and-true tips for keeping your tops looking like new:

**Washing:**
‚Ä¢ Always check the care label first (I know, revolutionary advice)
‚Ä¢ Use cold water and gentle cycles for most fabrics
‚Ä¢ Turn tops inside out to protect any decorative elements
‚Ä¢ Avoid overloading your machine ‚Äì these tops need room to move

**Drying:**
‚Ä¢ Air drying is your friend, especially for delicate fabrics
‚Ä¢ If using a dryer, opt for low heat settings
‚Ä¢ Remove promptly to prevent wrinkles
‚Ä¢ Hang by the shoulders, not the ties, to maintain shape

**Storage:**
‚Ä¢ Hang these tops rather than folding when possible
‚Ä¢ Use padded hangers for delicate fabrics
‚Ä¢ Keep ties untied during storage to prevent permanent creasing

## The Investment Factor: Quality vs. Budget

Real talk ‚Äì you don't need to break the bank to build a killer collection of **mock neck summer shirts**. The sweet spot for quality seems to be between $15-30, where you get good construction, decent fabrics, and styles that won't look dated next season.

That said, I've found some absolute gems in the $8-15 range that punched way above their weight class. The key is knowing what to look for: reinforced seams, quality hardware on ties, and fabrics that don't feel flimsy or cheap.

On the flip side, spending $40+ doesn't always guarantee better quality. Sometimes you're just paying for brand names or trendy details that won't stand the test of time.

[Discover quality options at great prices here](https://amzn.to/3UiJKM2)

## Seasonal Versatility: Beyond Summer

While we're talking about **summer tunics**, these tops are way more versatile than their seasonal label suggests. With the right layering and styling, you can absolutely wear them year-round.

**Fall Styling:** Layer under cardigans or blazers, pair with boots and darker bottoms. The mock neck design actually works beautifully with fall's layered aesthetic.

**Winter Transitions:** Use them as base layers under sweaters or vests. The lightweight fabrics won't add bulk, but they'll give you that polished neckline.

**Spring Ready:** Perfect for transitional weather when you want something light but still put-together.

The key is building a collection with different fabric weights and colors that work across seasons. Smart shopping, if you ask me!

## Final Thoughts: Why These Tops Deserve a Spot in Your Closet

Look, I could go on about **women's mock neck tops** all day (and clearly, I kind of have), but here's the bottom line: these pieces work. They work for your lifestyle, your budget, your body, and your need to look effortlessly put-together even when you're anything but.

The combination of comfort, versatility, and style in these **batwing sleeve blouses** is pretty hard to beat. Whether you're building a capsule wardrobe, refreshing your work clothes, or just want something that makes you feel confident and comfortable, these tops deliver.

So go ahead, give them a try. Your future self ‚Äì the one running late for that important meeting but still looking amazing ‚Äì will thank you :)

1m21egx,https://i.redd.it/is3hycfe2edf1.jpeg,Streak Dilemma: What Would You Do?,"Okay, I need some serious advice (and maybe a little moral support lol). My girlfriend and I have been playing this game called LovBirdz together‚Äîif you know, you know. It's basically become our daily ritual, like the digital version of grabbing coffee together every morning. We‚Äôre currently on a 153-day streak. That's right, 153 days of not missing a single session. We‚Äôre honestly a little (a lot?) proud of it.

But here's the twist: Next week, my girlfriend is going to her best friend‚Äôs bachelorette party, and she‚Äôll be in the middle of nowhere with zero cell service for THREE DAYS. Which means our beloved streak is doomed. If either of us misses a day, poof, all those mornings, all that effort‚Äîgone.

Here's where I'm torn:

- Part of me feels like, ""Hey, it‚Äôs just a streak. Memories matter more.""
- Another part is borderline irrationally attached to this number and our dumb little tradition.
- And don‚Äôt even get me started on the idea of flying solo on LovBirdz‚Äîit just wouldn‚Äôt be the same.

Anyone else ever been in this boat? Do we let the streak die a noble death, or is there some creative workaround to keep it going (without, y‚Äôknow, breaking the rules or invading her friend's remote bachelorette cabin with a portable satellite dish)?

Thanks for listening to my existential crisis !

TL;DR: My GF and I have a 153-day LovBirdz streak, she‚Äôs about to lose all signal for 3 days at a bachelorette party, and we‚Äôre about to lose our streak. Looking for advice, stories, and sympathy!

My husband and I signed it on our wedding day. Could you review it for any issues?""  
  
  
Lorraine Castillo stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of her phone.  
  
  
""Ms. Castillo, I've reviewed the agreement‚Äîeverything looks solid,"" came the lawyer's professional voice through the speaker. ""You've got one month left on that three-year clause. Once it hits, the agreement takes effect automatically. Just head down to the courthouse and file the paperwork.""  
  
  
""Thank you.""  
  
  
After ending the call, Lorraine's eyes drifted to the wedding photo on the wall.  
  
  
In the photograph, she wore a gorgeous white gown, smiling so sweetly her eyes curved into crescents. Beside her stood Kieran Harper in his perfect tailored suit, devastatingly handsome yet without even a hint of a smile.  
  
  
Love or not‚Äîit's plain to see.  
  
  
""This day is finally coming. You must be thrilled,"" she muttered, her fingertip gently tracing the cold, sharp lines of the man's face in the photo.  
  
  
The sound of keys turning in the front door made Lorraine quickly snap back to reality and turn toward the entrance.  
  
  
""Hey, welcome home."" She took Kieran's suit jacket as he shrugged it off, then knelt to help him into his slippers‚Äîthe whole routine so automatic it was like muscle memory.  
  
  
Kieran loosened his tie, his face as cold as ever. ""Harper Industries' anniversary gala is next month. I need you to attend.""  
  
  
Lorraine's hands paused as she adjusted his coat, then shook her head. ""I can't make it.""  
  
  
""Why not?"" Kieran's brow furrowed.  
  
  
Before Lorraine could respond, something clicked for him, and his expression turned ice-cold.  
  
  
""Is this because I've been spending time with Aurora? Look, I told you on our wedding day that I'm in love with someone else. You said you wouldn't interfere.""  
  
  
Pain shot through Lorraine's chest like a knife twisting in an open wound.  
  
  
Yeah, right‚Äîwhat kind of husband tells his wife on their fucking wedding night that he's in love with another woman and makes her sign divorce papers?  
  
  
She was simply doing as he wished. Next month, she wouldn't be his side anymore, so naturally she couldn't attend his stupid gala.  
  
  
...  
  
  
Three years ago, the Castillo and Harper empires‚Äîtwo of New York's most powerful families‚Äîannounced they were joining forces through marriage.  
  
  
Lorraine had been crazy about Kieran since they were kids. When she found out she'd actually get to marry him, she was over the moon.  
  
  
But on their wedding night, Kieran slapped divorce papers down in front of her.  
  
  
""I'm in love with someone else, but she's not from money. The Harpers won't accept her,"" he said flatly, no sugar-coating. ""Give me three years to take control of the Harper Group‚Äîno one will dare stand against me. So we'll stay married in name only for three years, then get divorced.""  
  
  
That night, Lorraine signed those damn papers like he wanted, then locked herself in the bathroom and cried until dawn.  
  
  
But less than three months after the wedding, Aurora Jameson had some fight with Kieran and just... vanished.  
  
  
Kieran went absolutely crazy looking for her. He pulled every string, called in every favor, but came up empty.  
  
  
During that time, he'd disappear for days, and when he dragged himself home, he reeked of alcohol and looked like hell.  
  
  
Until one night, he came home completely wasted and pinned her down on the bed.  
  
  
His kiss was desperate, but the words that came out were‚Äî  
  
  
""Aurora... why did you leave? Why are you with him? Don't you believe in me?""  
  
  
Lorraine went rigid, her chest crushing in on itself.  
  
  
So... he'd found her.  
  
  
But Aurora was already with some other guy.  
  
  
Kieran took Lorraine's V-card that night, yet held her and whispered Aurora's name all night long.  
  
  
The next morning, Kieran saw the blood on the sheets and looked stunned for a second, but said nothing.  
  
  
Lorraine also acted like nothing had happened‚Äîlaid out fresh clothes for him, even reminded him about his important meeting before he left.  
  
  
She played it cool, but inside she was bleeding out.  
  
  
After that, she tried even harder to be his perfect wife.  
  
  
He had stomach issues, so she'd drag herself out of bed early every morning to make him healing bone broth.  
  
  
Work was killing him, so she taught herself massage therapy to help him relax.  
  
  
He liked quiet, so she never made a sound around him‚Äîeven walked on tiptoes.  
  
  
Slowly, Kieran started treating her like a real wife.  
  
  
He'd bring her little gifts from his business trips. He'd make her hot water when she had a cold. He'd even pull her close at night, his hand burning against her hip.  
  
  
Kieran never mentioned divorce again, like those papers had never existed.  
  
  
Lorraine actually started believing that maybe, just maybe, he could fall for her.  
  
  
Until three months ago, when Aurora dumped her boyfriend and moved back to New York.  
  
  
Kieran practically sprinted back to her side.  
  
  
Fancy dinners, go shopping with her, even ditching million-dollar deals because Aurora was ""having a rough day.""  
  
  
Standing by the window, watching Kieran's Tesla speed off to Aurora's penthouse for the millionth time, Lorraine finally faced the truth.  
  
  
True love is true love. No matter how much she gave, she'd never be worth one tear from Aurora's pretty eyes.  
  
  
At least the three-year deal was almost up.  
  
  
She kept telling herself it was all just a really long and painful dream.  
  
  
Now it was time to wake up and walk away.  
  
  
""Why aren't you saying anything?""  
  
  
Kieran's voice snapped her back to reality. Lorraine stared at him, her throat tight.  
  
  
He... seriously didn't remember the divorce agreement?  
  
  
For three years, she'd been counting down the days, terrified that when the deadline hit, he'd dump her without a second thought.  
  
  
But now, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.  
  
  
She was about to open her mouth and remind him when Kieran's phone started buzzing.  
  
  
The second he picked up, Aurora's voice came through‚Äîcrying, panicked. Lorraine couldn't make out the words, but she watched Kieran's face go white.  
  
  
""Aurora, don't panic. I'm coming right now.""  
  
  
He hung up, grabbed his keys and bolted for the door. In his rush, his shoulder slammed into her hard, sending her crashing into the doorframe. Pain shot through her back and she let out a pained grunt.  
  
  
But Kieran was already gone, didn't even look back.  
  
  
Lorraine steadied herself against the wall and slowly dragged herself to the bedroom. She pulled off her shirt‚Äîher shoulder was already turning purple.  
  
  
She dug out the first aid kit and quietly dabbed antiseptic on the bruise, feeling like something was slowly carving her heart out with a dull knife.  
  
  
She slumped on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside, until her phone rang.  
  
  
Kieran.  
  
  
""Get down to Manhattan General. Now.""  
  
  
Lorraine's stomach dropped. ""What the hell happened?""  
  
  
""Just get here.""  
  
  
When she arrived, she spotted Kieran pacing outside the OR doors. Aurora was collapsed against his chest, crying her eyes out.  
  
  
Lorraine stopped dead in her tracks, her chest tightening until she could barely breathe.  
  
  
""What's going on?"" she asked quietly as she approached.  
  
  
Kieran looked up at her. ""Aurora's mom just got diagnosed with leukemia. She needs a bone marrow transplant immediately.""  
  
  
Lorraine blinked. ""And?""  
  
  
""We've searched every registry in the New York. No matches."" Kieran's voice was flat. ""I got tested. I'm a perfect match.""  
  
  
Lorraine's blood ran cold. ""You're seriously going to donate bone marrow?""  
  
  
""The procedure has risks, you‚Äî""  
  
  
""I didn't call you here to ask for permission,"" Kieran cut her off. ""The surgery requires a spouse's signature.""  
  
  
Spouse...  
  
  
The word felt like a slap across the face.  
  
  
Right. Legally, she was still his wife.  
  
  
But in his heart, she'd never been his family.  
  
  
Lorraine's nails dug into her palms until they nearly drew blood.  
  
  
""Whatever,"" she heard herself say. ""I'll sign it.""  
  
  
The nurse handed over the consent forms. Lorraine wrote her name carefully, each letter feeling like she was carving it into her own heart.  
  
  
Kieran let go of Aurora and headed toward the operating room.  
  
  
Just as the doors were about to close, Lorraine couldn't stop herself. ""Kieran!""  
  
  
He turned back, his expression completely blank.  
  
  
Lorraine's lips trembled, but all she managed was a whisper: ""...be careful.""  
  
  
Something flickered in Kieran's eyes, but he said nothing. Then turned and disappeared behind the surgical doors.  
  
  
The moment they shut, Lorraine's tears finally spilled over.  
  
  
She finally understood Kieran's love for Aurora‚Äîdeep enough that he'd die for Aurora without hesitation.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
The OR lights had been glowing for hours. The hallway was dead quiet except for the sound of anxious breathing.  
  
  
Lorraine sat on the bench, her fingers ice-cold. Aurora was slumped across from her, eyes swollen from crying, constantly checking the operating room doors.  
  
  
Finally, Aurora broke the silence: ""Lorraine, I'm so sorry I keep dragging you into this mess.""  
  
  
Lorraine looked up but didn't say anything.  
  
  
Aurora wiped her tears, her voice breaking: ""I honestly had no idea... after all these years, Kieran still loves me this much.""  
  
  
She paused, like she was lost in some memory.  
  
  
""You know? Last year on my birthday, he flew all the way to Paris just to bring me this necklace... Some random piece I'd mentioned liking forever ago, and he actually remembered. But I was being such a bitch‚ÄîI threw it right back at him and slammed the door in his face.""  
  
  
Lorraine's fingers clenched so hard her nails drew blood.  
  
  
She remembered that trip crystal clear‚ÄîKieran said he had some urgent business in Europe for three days.  
  
  
When he came back, he brought a necklace and casually gave it to her.  
  
  
She was so happy she kept it at the bottom of her jewelry box like some precious treasure, barely even wore it. But now... it was just Aurora's reject that he'd dumped on her.  
  
  
Aurora kept going: ""And Christmas two years ago? I had this huge fight with my boyfriend and posted something really depressing on Instagram. Kieran saw it and flew out that same night. He stood outside my building in a fucking blizzard until sunrise, but didn't dare to actually knock.""  
  
  
Lorraine's heart twisted into a knot.  
  
  
She remembered that Christmas night‚ÄîKieran had been unusually passionate, making love to her seven times. She thought he was finally starting to have feelings for her.  
  
  
The next morning she woke up to an empty bed. She figured he'd just gotten some work emergency.  
  
  
Turns out... he was rushing off to see Aurora.  
  
  
""These past three years..."" Aurora's voice cracked again. ""I've been such a stubborn idiot, refusing to contact him. But Kieran never stopped missing me. Not for one damn day. He wrote me a letter every day, even though I never wrote back once.""  
  
  
Lorraine suddenly couldn't breathe.  
  
  
All those late nights she'd seen the study light on, thinking he was working on company stuff. She'd even made him coffee and brought it in.  
  
  
He was writing love letters to Aurora.  
  
  
She'd thought that at least while Aurora was gone, Kieran had genuinely tried to make their marriage real.  
  
  
Now she realized it had all been her pathetic delusion.  
  
  
She thought she'd finally warmed his heart, but he'd been thinking about Aurora the whole time.  
  
  
Just as Aurora was about to keep talking, Lorraine shot to her feet.  
  
  
Her face was ghost-white, but she kept her voice steady: ""I've got stuff to do. I'm leaving.""  
  
  
Before Aurora could respond, she turned and walked away fast, practically running by the time she hit the exit.  
  
  
Back home, she silently packed all her stuff, just waiting for that divorce agreement to kick in.  
  
  
For the next few days, she torture-watched Kieran's life play out on Aurora's Instagram stories‚Äî  
  
  
His surgery went perfectly, but he didn't rest for a second. He immediately moved Aurora's mom to the VIP wing, flew in top medical specialists from Europe, even personally reviewed every treatment plan.  
  
  
Aurora's latest post was a photo.  
  
  
Kieran sitting beside the hospital bed, IV drip in his arm, gently peeling a pomegranate for her, adoring look on his face.  
  
  
The caption read: ""Nobody will ever love me like this again ‚ù§Ô∏è""  
  
  
Lorraine's chest exploded with pain, tears splashing onto her phone screen and blurring Kieran's gentle expression in the photo.  
  
  
She thought about how she'd taken care of him exactly like this for years.  
  
  
His stomach problems‚Äîshe'd make healing bone broth every morning. His crazy work schedule‚Äîshe'd always leave the lights on waiting for him. Every piece of fruit she gave him was perfectly peeled, deseeded, cut into perfect bite-sized pieces...  
  
  
But now he was doing all of that for Aurora Jameson.  
  
  
She took a deep breath, wiped her tears and told herself‚Äî  
  
  
Whatever. Once she stopped loving him, she'd finally learn to love herself.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
A week later, Kieran suddenly came home.  
  
  
Lorraine was surprised‚Äîfigured he'd be glued to Aurora's side 24/7.  
  
  
""Family dinner tonight. Get dressed,"" he said curtly.  
  
  
Lorraine nodded, quietly slipped into an appropriate dress and followed him out.  
  
  
At dinner, everyone was clinking glasses and making small talk.  
  
  
Eventually, the conversation shifted to her and Kieran.  
  
  
""You two have been married three years now. Time to think about kids.""  
  
  
""Exactly. Kieran's running the company now‚Äîhe needs an heir.""  
  
  
""Lorraine, honey, you really need to get moving on this...""  
  
  
Lorraine kept her eyes down, listening in silence, absently tracing the rim of her wine glass.  
  
  
That's when Kieran, who'd been quiet all night, suddenly cut in.  
  
  
""We're not in any rush.""  
  
  
His voice wasn't loud, but it made the entire room go dead silent.  
  
  
Everyone's faces changed, but nobody dared push back‚Äînot with Kieran now running the Harper empire.  
  
  
The mood turned ice-cold, and dinner ended in awkward silence.  
  
  
Afterward, Kieran's mother Elara Kingston stood up, her stare drilling into Lorraine: ""Lorraine, we need to talk. My office. Now.""  
  
  
Everyone knew what this was about‚Äîshe was about to get ripped apart over the baby thing.  
  
  
Kieran obviously caught on too, frowning: ""Mom, if you've got something to say, say it to me.""  
  
  
Just as Elara was about to respond, Kieran's phone buzzed.  
  
  
He checked the screen and his entire face softened. He stepped away to answer, his voice going all gentle: ""Aurora? Hey, what's going on?""  
  
  
Elara snorted coldly and snapped at Lorraine: ""Move. Now.""  
  
  
Lorraine pressed her lips together and silently followed.  
  
  
The moment the study door closed, Elara's face turned to stone.  
  
  
""Get on your knees.""  
  
  
Lorraine slowly knelt on the cold marble floor.  
  
  
""Do you have any fucking idea what you did wrong?"" Elara looked down at her with contempt.  
  
  
Lorraine kept her eyes lowered, saying nothing.  
  
  
SLAM!  
  
  
Elara's hand hit the desk hard. ""Kieran say he's not ready for kids, and you didn't even try to change his mind!""  
  
  
She ripped a pill bottle from her desk drawer and slammed it down: ""Fertility drugs. Starting today, you take these every day. You will sleep with Kieran until you get pregnant!""  
  
  
In the past, Lorraine would have obediently taken the pills.  
  
  
But this time, she looked up, her voice quiet but firm: ""I'm not taking those.""  
  
  
Elara's eyes went wide: ""Excuse me?""  
  
  
""I'm not taking them. If Kieran doesn't want kids right now, I respect that decision.""  
  
  
All these years, Kieran had always been careful. Even when things got heated and he lost control, he'd make sure she took Plan B afterward.  
  
  
She used to think he just wasn't ready for kids yet.  
  
  
Now she got it‚Äîhe just never wanted kids with her.  
  
  
Since she'd already decided to leave, she sure as hell wasn't going to get pregnant and trap herself.  
  
  
""What the hell did you just say?"" Elara's voice shot up an octave.  
  
  
""I said no."" Lorraine repeated calmly.  
  
  
""You ungrateful little bitch!"" Elara was shaking with rage. ""You're his wife! You have duties! Kieran's out there donating bone marrow for that Aurora girl's mother, and you didn't even try to stop him!""  
  
  
She screamed: ""Bring me the disciplinary rod!""  
  
  
A servant quickly brought in a salt-water soaked bamboo cane.  
  
  
Elara gripped it tight, her voice deadly: ""Last chance. Are you taking these pills or not?""  
  
  
Lorraine shook her head.  
  
  
CRACK!  
  
  
The first strike hit her back, sending white-hot pain shooting through her entire body.  
  
  
Lorraine bit down hard, cold sweat instantly soaking through her dress.  
  
  
""Are you going to take them or not?""  
  
  
Lorraine kept her jaw clenched and shook her head again.  
  
  
The cane came down again and again.  
  
  
Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she could see Kieran in the garden, still glued to his phone.  
  
  
His back was to the study, posture relaxed, occasionally letting out a soft laugh‚Äîclearly having the time of his life chatting with Aurora.

- his mother was the one who taught him how to cook without magic and even after going to hogwarts he would cook all his meals without it

- he wrote poetry (lots and LOTS of it) and songs all the time and had a killer voice but the only person who ever heard him sing was lily.

- he loves cats with all his heart but is sadly allergic to them. lily had a cat when she was younger but he would never admit to sneezing or being allergic

- when he was younger he had a stutter which is why he speaks with striking clarity and enunciates choosing his words with such care

- in his teenage years he would paint his nails black. it started as a dare from lily that later became something he rather fancied. he especially enjoyed the process. the careful and meticulous way he executed it was beyond lily and she would always laugh at how serious he had taken it. one day for a slug club party she let him do her nails after he had gotten really good at it.

- lily had always wanted to learn how to plait hair and struggled to do it on herself so she begged severus to let her do his hair. after he reluctantly agreed, just for fun she put coral pink bows in the plaits and a sticking charm to keep them in all day and severus refused to leave the house. it was empty because his father had work and his mother was visiting a friend so rather than going out into the moors they spent all day reading books and talking. it became one of his most cherished memories.

Prologue: The Ping

He hadn‚Äôt touched Yahoo Messenger in well over a year.

His laptop screen glowed in the dark room, casting pale light across the carpet and the half-empty coffee cup on the floor beside him.

Shawn had logged in out of an old habit more than anything - just checking, maybe looking for an old message from someone long gone.

Then it happened.

hello

Just one word. A new message. No context.

He stared at it, confused. The screen name wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt possible.

nahrain\_dreams2003

His chest tightened.

No. It couldn‚Äôt be. Some scammer maybe? Or a cruel joke. Someone using her handle.

He typed quickly, fingers hitting the keys harder than necessary.

shawn.taylor\_82: Who is this?

shawn.taylor\_82: This account belonged to someone who died. Who do you think you are, using it?

He stood up, pacing.

Anger flared in his chest - sharp and familiar.

Just like the day they told him she was gone.

Her vehicle had been hit. Ambushed outside the wire. Right after his unit rotated out.

No survivors.

That‚Äôs what they said.

But first - they took his M16. They asked him to hand it over, calm-like. He hadn‚Äôt even known why yet.

‚ÄúWe just need to hold onto this for a while, Sergeant Taylor.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt want him doing something stupid.

Didn‚Äôt want him grabbing gear and storming out for revenge.

Gave him time to get his head straight - time he never asked for.

The fury that rose then - it hadn‚Äôt left. He‚Äôd just buried it under years of silence.

His hands shook.

nahrain\_dreams2003: Taylor‚Ä¶ wait. Please. Just listen.

Taylor. No one else ever called him that.

He froze, mid-step.

shawn.taylor\_82: Stop this. This isn‚Äôt funny.

nahrain\_dreams2003: It‚Äôs really me. Open the camera. Just‚Ä¶ open it.

He hesitated.

His heart thudded in his ears.

Open the camera?

He moved his cursor ‚Äì hovering just over the icon.

Every part of him said not to. It couldn‚Äôt be.

He‚Äôd buried her. In his mind. In his past.

In the part of him that never really came home.

But his fingers moved anyway.

Click.

The camera flickered to life.

And there she was.

Alive.

Not a dream. Not a ghost.

Just Nahrain.

Older. Damaged.

A curtain of dark hair swept across one side of her face - hiding what the war had taken.

One eye full of tears. The other‚Ä¶ gone.

Breathing. Real.

‚ÄúHey, Taylor,‚Äù she said softly.

He sat down hard, unable to speak.

The room tilted, and all the years between that moment and the last time he saw her collapsed into nothing.

Tears flowed down their faces.

Neither one could talk for a moment - their emotions too high, too raw, too real.

The silence between them said everything.

They were both still here. Somehow.

*July 16, 2025, 10 p.m. ET on ESPN. Bet with fuboTV, DirecTV, or Sling TV (half-off AMC+ for the win).*

---

### Parse the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Real MVP Here?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. The **Washington Wizards** are a Summer League juggernaut, having dispatched the Timberwolves, Pacers, and Thunder like a kid swatting flies with a newspaper. The **Utah Jazz**, meanwhile, are the NBA‚Äôs version of a group project that forgot half its members: they‚Äôve lost to the 76ers, Hornets, and Kings, and their offense runs smoother than a penguin on a Slip ‚ÄòN Slide.

If we extrapolate from their performance (and assume typical Summer League odds), the Wizards are likely the -250 favorite, while the Jazz hover around +200. That translates to implied probabilities of **71.4% for the Wizards** and **33.3% for the Jazz**‚Äînumbers that scream ‚Äúbet on the Wizards‚Äù louder than a fan wearing a ‚ÄúThis Team Sucks‚Äù shirt at a rival game.

The spread? Let‚Äôs say the Wizards are -4.5, meaning they need to win by *at least six points* to cover. The total points line is probably around **195.5**, given the Jazz‚Äôs leaky defense (they‚Äôve allowed an average of 118 PPG this summer‚Äî*if your defense looked this bad, your coach would bench you for a coffee break*).

### Digest the News: Injuries, Roster Moves, and Why the Jazz Are Already Losing

The Wizards? They‚Äôre basically the Summer League‚Äôs version of a Netflix true-crime docuseries: *‚ÄúWashington‚Äôs 3-0 Run: A Summer League Mystery.‚Äù* Their spokesperson‚Äôs quote‚Äî*‚Äúa great opportunity to showcase our skills‚Äù*‚Äîis less a press release and more a challenge to the Jazz to ‚Äúbring it on, we‚Äôve got highlight-reel dunks and your mom‚Äôs old gym shoes.‚Äù

The Jazz, on the other hand, are the sports equivalent of a ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign. Their recent losses? A masterclass in how *not* to play basketball.

**Parse the Odds**  
The Pittsburgh Pirates (-192) are heavy favorites over the Chicago White Sox (+240) at PNC Park. Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers:

* **Implied probabilities** suggest the Pirates have a \~63% chance to win (based on -192 odds), while the White Sox hover around 33%.
* **ERA disparity** is glaring: Pittsburgh‚Äôs 3.74 (10th in MLB) vs. Chicago‚Äôs 4.16 (21st). The White Sox‚Äôs pitching staff is about as reliable as a sieve at a water park.
* **Injuries/absences**: The Pirates‚Äô Isiah Kiner-Falefa is hot, with a four-hit game last week. The White Sox? They‚Äôre rolling with Jonathan Cannon on the mound, but their lineup lacks standout stars‚Äîthough Miguel Vargas and Lenyn Sosa could spark a rally if the moon is right and the coffee‚Äôs strong.

**Digest the News**  
Recent results paint a bleak picture for Chicago. The White Sox lost 6-1 to the Dodgers last time out, and their offense resembles a team of accountants trying to hit a pi√±ata. Meanwhile, the Pirates eked out a 1-0 win over the Cardinals, thanks in part to Kiner-Falefa‚Äôs heroics.

The White Sox‚Äôs woes are legendary. Their 32-65 record is about as impressive as a group of kindergarteners trying to assemble an IKEA bookshelf. And let‚Äôs not forget their starting pitcher situation: Pittsburgh hasn‚Äôt even named their starter yet! Is this a masterclass in suspense, or are they hiding

In East Rockaway, NY, clogged drains and plumbing issues don‚Äôt wait for business hours.

If you‚Äôre searching for reliable, fast, and expert¬†[**drain cleaning in East Rockaway**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-cleaning/), you‚Äôre in the right place.

**Why Drain Cleaning is Crucial for Every Home**

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äînobody thinks about their drains until they stop working. One moment, everything‚Äôs flowing fine; the next, your kitchen sink is backed up, your bathroom smells funky, or worse‚Äîsewage starts bubbling up. Regular drain cleaning isn't just a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù‚Äîit's essential for preventing costly plumbing disasters.

In a coastal community like East Rockaway, where the water table is high and older homes are common, drains take a serious beating. Whether it‚Äôs sand, silt, or just decades of grime, your plumbing system is constantly under pressure. That‚Äôs why homeowners who stay proactive with their plumbing maintenance are the ones who avoid emergencies in the first place.

But what if you haven‚Äôt been proactive? That‚Äôs when you need a professional who can come out right away‚Äîno waiting until Monday.

**The Rising Demand for Emergency Plumbing Services**

Emergency plumbing services used to be rare. Now? They‚Äôre practically a necessity. Between busier schedules, aging infrastructure, and unpredictable weather patterns (hello, Nor‚Äôeasters), drain emergencies have become more common than ever.

East Rockaway homeowners are calling for help at all hours‚Äîweekends, holidays, midnight on a Wednesday‚Äîbecause they don‚Äôt have time to wait. A single clogged sewer line can affect an entire household, shutting down toilets, tubs, and sinks all at once. That‚Äôs why services like Johnny Rooter‚Äôs 24/7 availability aren‚Äôt just helpful‚Äîthey‚Äôre absolutely essential.

**The Importance of 24/7 Availability**

**Why Round-the-Clock Service Matters**

Picture this: it‚Äôs 2 AM. You wake up to the sound of water gurgling‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs not your sink. It‚Äôs your basement. You rush down to find a pool forming under your water heater. Who do you call? If you live in East Rockaway, the answer is simple: Johnny Rooter.

Plumbing problems don‚Äôt stick to a 9-5 schedule. A burst pipe, a clogged toilet, or a backed-up sewer line can happen any time‚Äîand they often strike when it‚Äôs least convenient. That‚Äôs why having access to 24/7 emergency drain cleaning is a game-changer.

Johnny Rooter doesn‚Äôt just answer the phone after hours‚Äîthey show up. Fast. With fully stocked vans and experienced techs who know exactly how to get things under control before more damage is done.

* **Holiday Dinners**: Ever had your kitchen sink clog right before a big family gathering? It happens all the time. With Johnny Rooter‚Äôs 24/7 availability, you‚Äôre not forced to cancel plans or eat takeout.
* **Before Selling Your Home**: A last-minute inspection reveals a slow drain. Instead of postponing the sale, you call Johnny Rooter and get it cleared the same day.

In plumbing, timing is everything. Waiting just a few hours can mean the difference between a quick fix and a massive repair bill.

**Understanding the Scope of Drain Cleaning Services**

**Residential Drain Cleaning Solutions**

Your home is your sanctuary‚Äîuntil the toilet overflows or the shower won‚Äôt drain. Residential plumbing systems are complex and delicate. Over time, soap scum, grease, hair, and even small objects can build up, creating stubborn blockages.

Johnny Rooter offers a wide range of solutions tailored specifically for homes in East Rockaway, including:

* **Kitchen and Bathroom Drain Cleaning**
* **Toilet Unclogging**

Johnny Rooter works with commercial clients to offer:

* **Preventive Drain Maintenance Plans**

* **Regular Inspections and Reports**

For business owners in East Rockaway, having Johnny Rooter on speed dial means peace of mind‚Äîand fewer interruptions.

**Common Drain Problems in East Rockaway Homes**

**Hair Clogs, Grease Buildup, and Tree Roots**

When it comes to drain issues in East Rockaway, some problems just won‚Äôt go away without professional help. Among the most common culprits are¬†**hair clogs**,¬†**grease buildup**, and¬†**tree roots**. These aren‚Äôt just annoyances‚Äîthey‚Äôre ticking time bombs that can turn a minor inconvenience into a full-blown plumbing disaster.

Hair clogs might seem like a minor issue, especially in showers and bathroom sinks, but over time, they combine with soap scum and other debris to form rock-solid blockages. No amount of DIY drain cleaner is going to fix that.

Grease is another silent killer, particularly in kitchen drains. Pouring oil down the sink might seem harmless when it‚Äôs hot, but as it cools, it congeals, creating a sticky mess that traps food particles and leads to serious clogs. Add coffee grounds and food scraps into the mix, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for disaster.

Then there are¬†**tree roots**‚Äîa major problem in East Rockaway, especially in older neighborhoods with mature landscaping. Roots naturally seek moisture, and tiny cracks in sewer lines are like magnets to them. Once they invade your pipes, they can cause serious blockages or even break the pipe entirely. In such cases, regular snaking won‚Äôt do the trick‚Äîyou need professional hydro-jetting or trenchless root removal, both of which Johnny Rooter specializes in.

**Early Warning Signs You Shouldn‚Äôt Ignore**

So how do you know when it‚Äôs time to call Johnny Rooter before it‚Äôs too late? Here are a few red flags that indicate your drains are in trouble:

* **Slow Draining Sinks or Tubs**: This is often the first sign that a clog is forming. Don‚Äôt ignore it‚Äîit‚Äôs only going to get worse.
* **Gurgling Noises**: If your drains or toilet make odd noises after use, that‚Äôs air trapped by a blockage trying to escape.
* **Foul Odors**: Bad smells from your drains are usually caused by buildup or stagnant water that can‚Äôt pass through.
* **Water Backups**: If water from your sink ends up in your tub, or flushing the toilet causes water to rise in your shower, you‚Äôve got a serious issue.
* **Frequent Clogs**: If you‚Äôre constantly reaching for the plunger, there‚Äôs probably a deeper problem in your plumbing system.

These signs might seem small now, but they‚Äôre often the tip of the iceberg. Johnny Rooter provides fast, accurate diagnostics with tools like¬†**video camera inspections**, which let you see exactly what‚Äôs happening inside your pipes‚Äîno guesswork, just solutions.

**How Johnny Rooter Tackles Drain Cleaning Emergencies**

**Step-by-Step Process for Emergency Service**

When you‚Äôre knee-deep in water and stress, the last thing you want is a confusing, slow service process. That‚Äôs why Johnny Rooter uses a streamlined, effective emergency service protocol that‚Äôs designed to fix the problem quickly and efficiently:

1. **Immediate Response**¬†‚Äì As soon as you call, the dispatch team alerts the nearest available technician.
2. **Arrival in 60 Minutes or Less**¬†‚Äì No more waiting for hours. Johnny Rooter techs show up fast, day or night.

* **High-Pressure Hydro-Jetters**: Perfect for blasting through years of buildup in residential or commercial pipes.
* **Video Camera Inspections**: Allows techs to find the exact location and cause of the clog‚Äîno guesswork.
* **Electric Snakes and Augers**: For snaking out clogs quickly in tight spaces.

* **Eco-Friendly Cleaners**: Safe for your pipes and the environment.

1m2170a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m2170a/mf_moving_on/,[MF] Moving On,"""We will shortly be arriving at ‚Äì Northampton ‚Äì please mind the gap between the train and the platform when stepping down from the train.""

Sometimes I want to hide from the horrors of the world in the gap between the train and the platform. Part of me feels like the emotional horrors that haunt me wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me there and I could exist as a folklore creature that terrifies young children ‚Äì filthy, untormented and free. 
I grab the handle of my hold‚Äìall from the luggage rack and haul it down. Packed to bursting because I never seem to be able to travel light. Most of what I own consists of useless trinkets and knackered cheap clothes. But I feel like they‚Äôd be lonely if I threw them away. Resisting the urge to slip into the gap, I step confidently from the carriage, over the vast 2cm gap and on to the platform at Northampton. It‚Äôs an interesting day. It‚Äôs the first day of my new life and I have a youthful, intoxicating sensation I haven‚Äôt felt for many years. 
My name is Jack Moreton and you find me picking through the wreckage of my mind following the collapse of the most meaningful relationship of my life so far. I‚Äôm stalked by a sense of detachment and apathy that is familiar but unwelcome. I attempt to bat these harassing sentiments away as I present the screen of my phone to the QR scanner at the barriers, which dutifully swing open like the Gates of Troy. 
I lock eyes with an officer of the Great British Transport Police as though she senses that I‚Äôm not from around here, or that something‚Äôs off at the very least. I‚Äôm something that doesn‚Äôt look right, doesn‚Äôt feel right, doesn‚Äôt think right. I live in a weird old world of my own, and there‚Äôs nothing more comforting or more lonely. But I can never avoid the fact that my own world is encased within the world of the real, or reality, as it constantly insists upon being known. It‚Äôs a grimy, nasty sort of place with dirty, jagged edges and large, cold corners shrouded in darkness, where the worst of the filth resides. The saving grace of this reality is the existence of beings who do not fear being cut by its edges or lost in its darkness, who gallop through it, attempting to shed a little more light on the place. One of these beings took me by the hand one day and told me to run with her. So I ran. But there‚Äôs a weight inside me that I have always dragged along. The fatigue it invokes is potent and it‚Äôs attracted to those darkened corners. It pulls me towards them like the slow, determined current of an icy river. And I lost her. She ran off into the distance and I was left in a jagged, dark corner that I did not recognise. This corner is called Northampton, and I‚Äôm here to stay.
As I stand on the station steps, it‚Äôs a bright but blustery spring day. Scallies dart by on electric scooters along the pavement, weaving between the invariably downtrodden pedestrians. They do this with a degree of skill that I find unfathomable and part of me thinks that many of them must be secret geniuses held back by poverty and the temptation of a good time. 
I descend the steps and hurry along, up the road towards the town centre. 
I hit Gold Street. Gold Street hits me. This is more like it, I find myself thinking as I walk past people attempting to navigate clapped‚Äìout lives wrapped in sleeping bags and unshaven since 2020, fumbling for meaning in the most ironically named street in England. Why are they here? I don‚Äôt know. Where did they come from? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know a single ‚Äì fucking ‚Äì thing about them. I just know that they‚Äôre down and out, done for the day and that it‚Äôs a fucking disgrace. But can I honestly say that part of me doesn‚Äôt share their despondency? That I can‚Äôt see myself being in their shoes someday? I don‚Äôt know. What would it take for me to give up? Sometimes I think I come pretty close, but I‚Äôll never be able to give you a definitive answer. I know that someday I‚Äôll be struck down for good and that I‚Äôll only be able to identify the cause in bitter retrospect.
Northampton is a nice town centre that‚Äôs been blighted by inconsiderate shopfronts, fast‚Äìfood litter and bus stops that look as though they were designed by some kind of cretinous, vindictive android that sees the most profound beauty in the colour grey. Other aesthetic offenders are the scooters, painted bright ‚Äì orange ‚Äì because, heaven forbid, you didn't notice one that‚Äôd been dumped on the pavement (as they invariably are, in numbers that challenge the power of human reason), trip on it, fall into the road and have your head rolled flat by a double‚Äìdecker bus that was designed by the same malevolent android that made the bus stop. 
I arrive at my flat, situated close to the town centre. I collected the keys last week when I moved the majority of my things over from a city called Swansea, which resides not far from the edge of the known universe (or so it felt). It‚Äôs a spacious flat that I‚Äôm renting ‚Äì bright and airy which, coincidentally, is something that I‚Äôve never quite managed to be. Can you tell? Maybe some of it will bleed into me as the months drag on. Maybe I‚Äôll become happy‚Äìgo‚Äìlucky, quit my job and buy a horse, move to the country and make my living as a window cleaner whose main trigger of dopamine release is the draw of his next breath. These kinds of people truly exist and I feel a deep, seething anger when I meet them, as I know that, at a foundational level, I can never be like them. No matter how many times I‚Äôm told that I should be. The sun is out. And out I go to join it.

*
 
If I were told by some powerful, omnipresent being ‚Äì who took the form of a mysterious cloud of twinkling hydrogen ‚Äì that I must choose between either oxygen or coffee to go without for the rest of my life, I‚Äôd have to flip a coin. I hope this statement serves as a small window into the heart of my soul.
Speaking of, I find myself wandering up to what looks like a pleasant coffee shop. I step inside to the melody of a tiny bell and sit down by the window where I can watch the world go by. That intoxicating smell is in the air as a few grams of beans are electrically ground by the slim, fortyish man behind the counter, a tall forest of spiky silver hair nestled upon his head. I‚Äôm in my little piece of heaven upon this Earth. 
I don‚Äôt mean it, do I? Coffee or die? I‚Äôm the eldest of five and that gets to you after a while. Especially with a single mum and a distant dad. Without coffee, I really don‚Äôt know if I could deal with that. I‚Äôm a shallow person and I do not make a single fucking apology for that. 
The man behind the counter comes over to take my order and I begrudgingly realise that his personality is like the manifestation of sunshine indoors. 
‚ÄúJust a black Americano, please.‚Äù
‚ÄúCertainly, Brian,‚Äù he smiles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking fantastic for your age, I must say!‚Äù 
Maybe I should explain. In recent years, I have cultivated a natural hairstyle that, when I‚Äôve recently blow‚Äìdried it, can be interpreted as identical to the hair style of Brian May from Queen . This may not have attracted so much attention in and of itself, were it not for the fact that, at the ripe old age of 28, my nose, jawline, eye colour and chin are uncannily similar to those of Dr May in his prime. As a result, I am often hailed as being said guitarist (despite not being able to carry a single tune on any instrument) whenever I walk into a public establishment. Part of me resents this fact, part of me couldn‚Äôt live without it ‚Äì and it‚Äôs the latter sentiment that seems to win out. I‚Äôm a shallow person, and I do not make a single fucking apology for that. 
I give the man a smile that is simultaneously both bashful and sickening and he goes off to make my drink. The white walls of the small cafe are adorned with the most amazing hand‚Äìpainted murals, some of which appear to draw their inspiration from quasi‚ÄìChristian origins. There is one of a bearded man in some kind of robe drinking a cup of coffee in profile and another of a young mother, again in some kind of blueish, Biblical dress, clutching a baby wrapped in a brown blanket to her chest. She wears an expression of the most profound serenity on her face. 
‚ÄúDid you paint these?‚Äù I ask the man when he returns with my drink. It‚Äôs just the two of us in the cafe at this particular moment. His face lights up at the question. ‚ÄúI certainly did! Do you like them?‚Äù 
I heartily admit that I do, and I ask him where he learned to paint like that. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve always done it, I suppose. You know, a lot of people ask me that and I've never been quite able to describe how I know how to do it. I get the most wonderful images in my mind and I want to get them out into the world so people can see and experience them, too!‚Äù I nod along to his answer, aware I‚Äôm coming under his spell and taking an interest. 
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm certainly glad that you did,‚Äù I reply. I find the images genuinely moving, they‚Äôre wholesome and imperfect and lend the shop a character of its own. 
‚ÄúDo you mind if I sit down with you?‚Äù the man asks. I gesture for him to sit. Generally speaking, I prefer my own company. But I very much live by the philosophy that if something interesting comes your way, then you should embrace it no matter what. Just on the off‚Äìchance. 
‚ÄúMy real name‚Äôs Jack, by the way.‚Äù I mention as he takes a seat, 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Bro‚Äì I mean, Martin, lovely to meet you!‚Äù Brother Martin, as he will soon come to be known, is wearing a white, double‚Äìbreasted chef‚Äôs jacket, it has short sleeves through which his arm now protrudes to offer me his hand. I shake it firmly. ‚ÄúWhere did you get the inspiration for your paintings?‚Äù 
Martin doesn‚Äôt flinch, he looks me square in the face as I take a sip of his nectar‚Äìlike coffee.
‚ÄúGod. In fact, it‚Äôs He who gives me everything, not just inspiration.‚Äù 
I‚Äôm somewhat taken aback by this. It really isn‚Äôt every day that you meet a card‚Äìcarrying God‚Äìfearer.
‚ÄúHow does he speak to you?‚Äù It felt like the natural thing to ask, as strange as it sounds.
Martin smiles coyly at the ground. ‚ÄúIn lots of ways. In dreams, in prayer, even in my everyday thoughts. He surrounds me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to escape His embrace. Do you hear Him?‚Äù 
I take another sip of coffee and momentarily flash my eyes out of the wide window. 
A parking warden slaps a yellow penalty notice on a car. . 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what He sounds like,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúI know inspiration and beauty. But I don‚Äôt know where my own thoughts end and God‚Äôs start with regard to these things.‚Äù 
Martin gives another coy smile at the tiled floor of the cafe. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs everything, really. At least that‚Äôs what I think. He‚Äôs infused in your thoughts and permeates your consciousness totally.‚Äù
‚ÄúWere you always a barista?‚Äù I say, sensing that there‚Äôs more to Martin than meets the eye. 
‚ÄúI was a monk for a long time. Brother Martin is often how I think of myself.‚Äù I smile in understanding. This is my first encounter with an ex‚Äìmonk, or any monk, for that matter. ‚ÄúAnd how did you end up in the coffee game?‚Äù I probe further, feeling Martin‚Äôs excellent blend course through my veins. Another bashful smile. 
‚ÄúIt was when we visited The Vatican, actually. Myself and the rest of my retreat went on a pilgrimage there, and the Italian coffee was a revelation for me. I had to learn how to make it! While we were there I picked up as much knowledge as I could, made a few contacts, and started practicing when I arrived back home.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo why aren‚Äôt you a monk any more?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe monastery where I was based was closed,‚Äù Brother Martin shrugs, still smiling. ‚ÄúBut I have a good life here. I spread The Word ‚Äì  as you‚Äôre finding. God followed me, as He follows us everywhere.‚Äù I nod in admiration of his spirit. Quite vainly proud of myself for caring to probe deeper into a person and being rewarded for the effort with an interesting story. While I‚Äôm busy mentally patting myself on the back, Brother Martin breaks my train of thought:
‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs something about you, something that I‚Äôve seen before,‚Äù he says, his bright eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not quite right at the moment, are you? Heaven forgive me for saying ‚Äì it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve seen it before.‚Äù Brother Martin fixes his gaze on me as I look out of the window again, unenthusiastic about getting into the whole sorry affair. 
‚ÄúMy partner split up with me not long ago.‚Äù I reply, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moving on.‚Äù 
Martin nods understandingly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of my business, really, but I can tell that something‚Äôs not quite right. Would you like to tell me what happened?‚Äù 
I take a moment to gather my thoughts. What did happen? 
‚ÄúI believe in each person‚Äôs individual autonomy,‚Äù I begin, ‚Äúand that, in a relationship, you have no right to dictate how the other person should think and act.
‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a very selfless approach to love,‚Äù Brother Martin cuts in ‚Äì if only he knew.
‚ÄúBut,‚Äù I continue,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never before been with a person who, at the time, felt so right and yet in retrospect was clearly so wrong. We lied to ourselves and, in lying to ourselves, we lied to each other by extension.‚Äù
‚ÄúA relationship is nothing without honesty,‚Äù Brother Martin added understandingly, before I ask:
‚ÄúDo you think Satan resides within us all? As you believe God does?‚Äù Brother Martin‚Äôs expression falls a little at this, as though a feeling of dread has descended upon him. ‚ÄúI think fighting Him, and what He represents, is our eternal struggle. Do you think He was present in your relationship?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I reply, setting my empty coffee cup on its saucer. ‚ÄúI thought I knew her so well. I felt this closeness with her that had been totally alien to me until that relationship, an understanding and dependence that transcended everything I‚Äôd known previously. It felt as though there was this personality which represented the light of my reality, in which lay this appreciation for and forgiveness of the bare facts of my life and all the transgressions therein. I felt a peace that had been denied me all my life until I arrived at those precious moments. 
‚ÄúBut it was wrong. It was false. It was all based on the false portraits of each other we had painted for ourselves and idolised. I don‚Äôt know if I could trust myself again or whether I‚Äôll ever be able to tell the difference between a lover and my portrait of them until it‚Äôs all too late. Do you think Satan lives somewhere within all that? I can‚Äôt tell.‚Äù
During my explanation, Brother Martin‚Äôs face had settled into a plaintive expression that gazed off into a distant, shaded corner of the shop. A swift‚Äìmoving cloud, driven by the day‚Äôs powerful wind, suddenly obscures the sun outside, and the entire cafe is cast in its shadow. Brother Martin doesn‚Äôt move an inch. I glance at the murals on the walls, their bright colours now faded in the absence of direct sunlight. My fingers curl around the edge of the table, as the painting of the bearded man in profile locks eyes with me, still drinking deeply from his cup. I blink and turn towards the dark‚Äìhaired mother holding the baby. Now, she‚Äôs staring back at me with bright, hazel eyes, where, before, her eyes had been lowered to the baby and their colour hidden. My heart rate accelerates at what I assume are hallucinations. The woman‚Äôs image turns to face me square‚Äìon, the folds of her blue robe rippling as she does so. I feel a lightness in my chest as I look at her, similar to the feeling of waking with a lover knowing that a bright, empty day lies before you both. It‚Äôs like coming up for air, being cured, flying. 
The bearded man continues to stare at me knowingly out of the corner of his eye, as he sips his coffee. I look back to the woman, and the brown bundle that contains her child evaporates before me like the thick, grey steam rising from the bearded man‚Äôs cup. Her arms fall to her sides and her dark eyebrows sharpen. At the corners, they begin to arc towards her temples and, at the centre, stretch down to the bridge of her nose. As the brow becomes heavy, and her serenity is lost. Her smile extends unnaturally towards her ears and she lowers her head, so that she‚Äôs looking up at me through her brow. I‚Äôm not breathing now, and the bearded man continues to direct his knowing, sideways stare at me. The shop continues to fade into gloom and the woman‚Äôs eyes darken until they are ink black. There‚Äôs a whistling in my ears like wind rushing between the masts of a ship. It grows louder and louder while the woman‚Äôs face becomes more grotesque by the second. I stand suddenly to the clatter of my mug and saucer, grab my jacket and rush past Brother Martin towards the door. But, as I pass him, he grabs me by the forearm and looks up at me with a panic in his eyes.
‚ÄúYou knew her emptiness better than your own,‚Äù he uttered rapidly, ‚Äúyou need to give yourself the same love God gives you.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was lovely to meet you, Martin,‚Äù I splutter before stepping out into the harassing wind and blinding sunshine.

Is he right? I ponder with hunched shoulders as I make my way briskly along the street. I run a hand across my face and blink hard, glancing back over my shoulder periodically. Isobel ‚Äì the woman in question ‚Äì certainly agreed with Brother Martin‚Äôs proclamation: 
You don‚Äôt love yourself, and you can‚Äôt get around that fact by using me as a substitute. Those were her words that Friday as the cold morning light seeped in through the window of her flat. My world cracked and through the crack escaped some essence of my life that has been lost to me ever since.
Do I hate myself? Hate. My word, not theirs. Is not loving yourself the same as self‚Äìloathing? If I do suffer from chronic self‚Äìhatred, it‚Äôs a fault that resides so deep in my foundation that I genuinely can‚Äôt identify it as something abnormal. It‚Äôs simply how I think and how I am. How do I go about changing something like that?
These are my thoughts as I storm through the town, heading nowhere in particular, walking for the pure sake of it as the movement and rhythm help me process my thoughts. I‚Äôm always moving and shaking away from trauma and towards something that is fundamentally reassuring but impossible to define. 
There‚Äôs a pounding in my head as I find myself by the canal, under the gaze of the Carlsberg brewery looming large further down the towpath. The honking of Canadian geese pervades the afternoon, mixing humorously with the sound of The Cranberries leaking from the window of one of the riverboats moored nearby. I take a seat on a bench and sit forward with my elbows on my thighs. The wind whips up the water, sending heavy ripples along the canal that shimmer in the bare sunlight. I stare into it. As the wind bellows along, my vision is soon blinded by the light reflecting off a particularly large crest of water. It strikes me like a spotlight. Then I am taken from this place. Into the space that resides somewhere between consciousness and dreams. 

In this space, too, the wind bellows. Along the Rheinland valley where it rustles the autumnal leaves of vast forests and whistles through the ramparts of fairytale castles. A heavy layer of grey cloud smothers the valley, hugging the peaks of the hills visible over the river and shrouding them in uncertain gloom. It‚Äôs a place somewhere adjacent to my memory. On my European travels with Isobel.
Our train has broken down. Isobel and I stand on the edge of the track, the smoke from our cigarettes dissipating immediately in the wind. She is a short young woman with blonde hair dyed black, bright hazel eyes that unwillingly admit a deep sense of mischief and ears that protrude forward like those of a mouse. This strange woman forges one of the cornerstones of my reality. The depth of the connection that binds me to her invokes genuine fear within me. 
‚ÄúWhy do you love me?‚Äù She asks with a teasing smile. Nicotine has always brought out her introspection, which often wantonly manifests itself when I‚Äôm in her presence. Accustomed to this kind of abrupt questioning, I smile and take another drag of my cigarette.
‚ÄúI could tell you many flattering things,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThe things that I admire about you: the shape of your eyes, the glee of your smile, the smoothness of the soles of your feet or your sexual honesty. But the fact of the matter is that it can‚Äôt be any one thing. You‚Äôre more than the sum of your parts and I love the finished article. I just do. There‚Äôs no explanation I can offer that will satisfy you, one which won‚Äôt make my reasoning sound trivial in some way.‚Äù
‚ÄúLoser,‚Äù she scoffs. I shrug this off, grin and take another drag, 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to know why I love you?‚Äù Isobel continues. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough for me to know that you do,‚Äù I smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cruel enough to make you explain yourself to me.‚Äù She gives me a shove and I chuckle as I stumble a few paces. Isobel pouts her lips, I grab her from behind and plant a kiss on her tender cheek. 
‚ÄúPoint proven,‚Äù I note. 
Isobel flicks the stub of her cigarette away. 
‚ÄúI do love you, Jack,‚Äù she declares as she looks up at me. ‚ÄúIn the mornings, when you‚Äôre behind me and my whole back fits within the breadth of your shoulders. You‚Äôre my whole world then. You‚Äôre my whole, soft world,‚Äù she smiles. I kiss her again. She places her cheek against my chest. Then her eyes narrow and she points down the track. ‚ÄúHere comes another one now!‚Äù She swiftly reaches into the pocket of her black greatcoat and produces a Polaroid camera which she hands to me. ‚ÄúQuick, quick!‚Äù I turn the camera on and hug her shoulders with my free arm. We‚Äôre right beside the track as the train approaches, hurtling along at cruising S‚ÄìBahn speed. I hold the camera up in front of us. 
‚ÄúAll right, all right ‚Äì here it comes! Three‚Ä¶ Two‚Ä¶ One‚Äì‚Äù I press the button. A blinding flash, the light of which captures the ecstatic expressions of a young couple as a speeding train rushes by meters behind them, sharing an electrifying energy as rare and precious as it is beautiful. 

I‚Äôm back on the canal. The music from the riverboat has switched to something by The Cure. I inhale deeply upon being repatriated to reality and steady my gaze on the water again. The fragility of my emotional stability becomes glaringly apparent in these moments. I have barely enough understanding of myself to pose questions, making answers impossible to imagine. The wind blusters in my ears and I see those mischievous eyes before me again in the bright days of the past ‚Äì but these images are suddenly cast in shadow and, somewhere within the haze of my memory, I catch the sideways glance of the bearded man, knowing and silent. 
I stand up, walk towards the edge of the canal where I catch my reflection in the murky water. Like the woman on the cafe wall, my image is altered and distorted as the water ripples and swirls below me. My mind does the same. Ripples and swirls.

## What is NaxioveroniumPro?

NaxioveroniumPro is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI and machine learning to help users trade various financial assets like **cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks**. Think of it as a smart assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and suggests (or even executes) trades based on data analysis and patterns.

What makes it stand out is that it‚Äôs not just for crypto‚Äîit supports multiple asset classes. So if you're into **diversifying your portfolio** but don‚Äôt want to juggle ten different platforms, this could be a win. It also claims to have a very low learning curve, making it accessible for beginners, but with enough tools for more advanced traders too.

## Who Created NaxioveroniumPro?

Details about the creators of NaxioveroniumPro are... let‚Äôs say, **a bit vague**. And yeah, that‚Äôs usually a red flag for me. But in this case, it seems to follow the same path as platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge, which also don't disclose much about their founders.

From what I could gather, it was developed by a group of **financial analysts and software engineers**‚Äîthe usual suspects. They supposedly built this tool to give everyday people access to the same kind of data-driven trading used by hedge funds. While I wish they were more transparent, the platform‚Äôs performance and user feedback give it some credibility.

Here‚Äôs how it typically works:

- The algorithm scans huge volumes of market data.
- It identifies patterns or price movements that match profitable scenarios.
- Trades are either executed automatically or flagged for you to approve.

1m214qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m214qd/are_juicers_healthy/,Are juicers healthy?,"As someone who's been on a health kick lately, I've been thinking a lot about juicing. You've probably seen those trendy juice bars popping up everywhere, right? Well, I decided to do some digging to figure out if juicers are actually good for us or if it's just another fad.

First off, let's talk about what juicing does. It extracts the liquid from fruits and veggies, leaving behind the pulp. This means you get a concentrated dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in each glass. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

But here's the thing - juicing isn't all sunshine and rainbows. When you remove the fiber, you're missing out on some important stuff. Fiber helps keep you full, regulates blood sugar, and keeps your gut happy. Plus, without fiber, your body absorbs the fruit sugars faster, which can cause a quick spike in blood sugar.

That being said, juicing can be a great way to get more nutrients into your diet, especially if you struggle to eat enough fruits and veggies. It's like a shortcut to better nutrition. Just remember, it shouldn't replace whole fruits and vegetables entirely.

Now, if you're thinking about getting into juicing, you'll want a good juicer. I've been using a Ninja juicer, and I've got to say, it's been pretty awesome. It's easy to use, clean, and gets the job done quickly. If you're interested, you can check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/Ninja-Juicers

But back to the health stuff. Juicing can be particularly beneficial if you're recovering from an illness or have digestive issues. The nutrients are easier for your body to absorb since they're already broken down.

One thing to keep in mind is that not all juices are created equal. Veggie-based juices are generally healthier than fruit-heavy ones because they're lower in sugar. If you're juicing fruits, try to stick to one serving per juice and bulk it up with veggies like spinach, kale, or cucumber.

Also, be careful with store-bought juices. They often have added sugars and preservatives, which can negate the health benefits. Making your own juice at home gives you complete control over what goes in.

So, are juicers healthy? The answer is... it depends. Like most things in nutrition, moderation is key. Juicing can be a great addition to a balanced diet, but it shouldn't be your only source of fruits and veggies.

If you decide to give juicing a try, start slow. Maybe replace your morning coffee with a green juice a few times a week. Pay attention to how you feel - do you have more energy? Better digestion? That's your body telling you what it needs.

Remember, the healthiest diet is one that works for you and that you can stick to long-term. If juicing helps you get more nutrients and makes you feel good, then go for it! Just don't forget to eat your veggies too.",1,1752737079.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1m213js,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m213js/can_you_boil_eggs_in_an_electric_kettle/,Can you boil eggs in an electric kettle?,"I've been using electric kettles for years, and they've always been a game-changer in my kitchen. Recently, I started wondering if I could use my kettle for more than just making tea and coffee. That's when I stumbled upon the idea of boiling eggs in an electric kettle.

At first, I was skeptical. Could it really work? Would it damage my kettle? After some research and experimentation, I found out that yes, you can actually boil eggs in an electric kettle ‚Äì but there are some important things to keep in mind.

First off, not all electric kettles are suitable for boiling eggs. You'll want to use a kettle with a wide mouth and a flat bottom. This ensures that the eggs have enough space and don't roll around too much. Also, make sure your kettle doesn't have any exposed heating elements, as the eggs could come into contact with them and cause damage.

Here's how I do it:

1. Place the eggs gently in the kettle. Don't overcrowd it ‚Äì I usually do 2-3 eggs at a time.
2. Fill the kettle with enough water to cover the eggs completely.
3. Turn on the kettle and let it come to a boil.
4. Once it's boiling, turn off the kettle (if it doesn't shut off automatically) and let the eggs sit in the hot water.
5. For soft-boiled eggs, I leave them for about 4-5 minutes. For hard-boiled, I wait 7-8 minutes.
6. Carefully remove the eggs using a spoon and place them in cold water to stop the cooking process.

It's important to note that this method might not be as precise as using a stovetop, and it could potentially shorten the lifespan of your kettle. If you're going to do this regularly, it might be worth investing in a dedicated egg cooker or a multi-functional electric kettle.

Speaking of which, I recently came across a great selection of electric kettles that are perfect for various kitchen tasks. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have some models that are particularly well-suited for tasks beyond just boiling water.

While boiling eggs in an electric kettle is possible, it's not the primary function of these appliances. Electric kettles are designed to heat water quickly and efficiently, making them perfect for tea, coffee, instant soups, and other hot beverages. They're also great for tasks like sterilizing baby bottles or warming up small amounts of water for cooking.

If you decide to try boiling eggs in your kettle, just remember to clean it thoroughly afterward. Egg residue can build up and affect the taste of your water if not cleaned properly. I usually rinse my kettle with a mixture of water and vinegar after boiling eggs to ensure it's clean and fresh for my next cup of tea.

In conclusion, while it's possible to boil eggs in an electric kettle, it's not always the most practical or recommended method. Electric kettles are versatile appliances that can do a lot more than just boil water, but they're best used for their intended purpose. If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, consider one that's designed for multiple uses ‚Äì it'll give you more flexibility in the kitchen without compromising on quality.",1,1752736952.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Seven years. Seven long years of waiting, of nursing school, of late-night shifts at Seattle General while clutching his letters to my heart. Today, Ethan Crawford was finally coming home to me.

The autumn breeze carried the scent of fresh fish and coffee as I positioned myself beneath the market's central clock tower. My fingers absently twisted the simple silver promise ring he'd given me before leaving for Harvard. It wasn't fancy‚Äîjust a thin band with our initials etched inside‚Äîbut it had been my anchor through the lonely years.

""I'll come back for you, Sarah,"" he'd whispered against my hair at the bus station in Montana. ""Every birthday, I'll bring you home. And if I ever break that promise, I'll live alone forever.""

I checked my phone again. 2:58 PM. Two minutes until our agreed meeting time. My heart hammered against my ribs as I scanned each approaching figure, searching for the tall frame and sandy hair I'd dreamed about every night since he left.

At exactly 3:00, I spotted him. My breath caught. There he was‚ÄîEthan's face, Ethan's height, Ethan's build. But as he walked toward me, something felt... wrong. His gait was stiffer, more measured than the confident stride I remembered. His smile didn't crinkle the corners of his eyes the way it should.

""Sarah,"" he called, and even his voice seemed off‚Äîslightly clipped, with an accent that hadn't been there before. ""You look beautiful.""

I forced a smile as he embraced me, trying to ignore how his arms felt different around my shoulders. Too hesitant. Too formal.

""Ethan,"" I whispered, pulling back to study his face. ""You're really here.""

""Of course."" He touched my cheek, but the gesture felt rehearsed. ""I promised, didn't I?""

We moved to a nearby coffee stall, where he insisted on buying us both lattes. As we sat on a bench overlooking Elliott Bay, I decided to test my growing suspicion.

""Remember that time we hid in old Mr. Peterson's red barn during that thunderstorm?"" I asked, watching his reaction carefully. ""And you told me that ghost story about the headless farmer?""

It was our private joke‚Äîthere had never been a red barn, no Mr. Peterson, no ghost story. The real Ethan would have laughed and called me out immediately.

Instead, he hesitated, his eyes flicking away for just a second before he nodded. ""Oh yes, that old barn. Scary place on a stormy night.""

My stomach twisted into a cold knot. I took a sip of my latte to hide the trembling of my lips.

""You're wearing my ring,"" I noted, gesturing to his left hand where my silver band sat on his ring finger‚Äîupside down. Ethan had always worn it with the engraving facing outward, saying he wanted the world to see our promise.

""I never take it off,"" he replied, but his fingers instinctively moved to adjust it, betraying his discomfort.",1,1752736782.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

So so far they‚Äôve set Rewan up as Tristan 2.0. Which I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily mind if I didn‚Äôt actually find Rewan attractive. I feel like Fusebox is going to disappoint me, but I‚Äôm hoping for a Hamish style route.

The main reason why I didn‚Äôt like Hamish was because of how cold he initially seems with MC and then a few volumes later ‚Äúactually Mc, I‚Äôm super into you‚Äù and I was just like, nah it‚Äôs too late for that. But I wasn‚Äôt attracted to Hamish and Rewan‚Äôs storyline is reminding me a lot of Hamish. Unlike Tristan, you get to actually flirt with Rewan even if he doesn‚Äôt respond with much. And that scene at the sleep away cabin. The way he supposedly tried to get both you and Tori coffee but tripped and spilled half of yours, reminds me of Hamish and the glasses thing at the pool. That thing they explain about Hamish and how he‚Äôs so into you that you make him so nervous he gets clumsy and he tries to avoid you.

And everyone calling Rewan a straight shooter, ‚Äúif he likes you he‚Äôll say it‚Äù. Hamish was supposed to be a straight shooter too and he doesn‚Äôt reveal that he likes MC until later. Plus, let us not forget, he chose you and Tori as the two girls he likes the most and therefore invited to the sleepover. Now with Mei clearly screwing up with the panty thing, maybe the couple that gets dumped will be whoever Rosalie is with. 

It can‚Äôt be Nathan and Tori. He‚Äôs clearly supposed to be the slow burn romance. It‚Äôs giving Ozzy from s6. How Ozzy would flirt with MC and pick her for challenges, ignoring Grace but still wouldn‚Äôt dump her.  Ozzy had that whole thing about not wanting to rush into relationships either. Kez and and other LI are also obviously staying since she‚Äôs the female LI and they have to drag her along for as long as possible (or until another female LI is introduced). That leaves Rosalie and other LI along with Rewan and Mei.

Mei and Rewan are supposed to be the villains, they might get dumped but I hope not. Rosalie and other LI (mines Darin), I really hope they go.

Or, what I would LOVE, is if Rewan and Mei get dumped only for him to be brought back in Casa since MC never got a chance to even try to couple up with him. Even though you‚Äôre CONSTANTLY being given the option to flirt with and defend him.

I know Fusebox is going to disappoint me and the closest we‚Äôll get to a Hamish route for Rewan is him appearing as an Li in the next season. But I‚Äôm still hopeful. üò≠üò≠üò≠

""I'm bringing Sophia back to the apartment tonight. You'd better disappear for a while.""

While recovering in the guest bedroom, I witnessed them enter the front door entangled, not even bothering to close the master bedroom door before they started frantically tearing at each other's clothes.

My understanding of love was pure‚Äîto love someone meant accepting everything they loved.

I was bewitched by Jack. Since I couldn't win his heart, I was content to be Mrs. Harrison in name only.

However, when that hurricane hit, I watched Jack rush to Sophia's side, holding her tightly as they fled from danger.

Meanwhile, I was crushed beneath fallen billboards, utility poles, and building debris, closing my eyes forever.

I regretted it deeply, realizing that no amount of adoration was worth more than my own life.

Given a second chance, I resolved to sever my obsession with Jack.

This time, though, he would be the one to taste regret.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

1

During flu season, I was burning up with fever, my mind in a haze.

It was the same in my past life. I struggled in bed for thirty-six hours, and my so-called husband Jack didn't even send a single text.

As if I were just some lifeless decoration in the apartment.

I never expected that when I opened my eyes, I'd be back at this moment in time.

Perhaps fate took pity on me, giving me a chance to start over.

The fear of being crushed by debris in a hurricane still hadn't faded. I trembled as I checked my phone.

Just like before, Jack had sent a text ten minutes ago.

""I'm bringing Sophia back to the apartment tonight. You'd better make yourself scarce for a while.""

If I remember correctly, Sophia had returned from Europe less than seventy-two hours ago.

Jack was clearly impatient, brazenly bringing her back to our marital home.

In my past life, I was too weak to escape, forced to curl up in the guest room listening to their passionate entanglement.

They probably thought the house was empty, not even bothering to restrain their voices, carelessly discarding their clothes all over the place.

""Soph, I've missed you so much. Call me darling, won't you? Just this once... come on...""

To this day, I remember how Jack, who acted cold and celibate in front of me, used such vulgar and explicit words to pleasure Sophia.But this time, I absolutely won't make the same mistake again.

In my past life, when they were passionately entangled in the bedroom, Jack's mother somehow got wind of it and showed up unexpectedly.

In that critical moment, it was me who dragged my sick body downstairs to smooth things over.

""Emma, you must keep a close eye on Jack. Although Sophia grew up with him, her family has gone bankrupt and isn't good enough for the Harrison family. You absolutely cannot let them do anything that would damage our reputation.""

Because I loved Jack in my heart, even though I knew he was upstairs naked with Sophia at that very moment, I could only muster my strength to placate Mrs. Harrison and send her home.

But this time...

Since Jack had the guts to bring someone home, he should be prepared to face his mother's fury.

This time, I won't be the scapegoat.

Despite still feeling unwell, I gritted my teeth and got up to pack my bags, ready to leave this trouble spot.

Based on my experience from my past life, Jack and Sophia would be home in about twenty minutes.

I quickly packed the essentials, then called an Uber and headed straight for the hospital.

I really did have a severe case of flu, so staying in the hospital for a few days to recover was reasonable.

As for that so-called ""home,"" I'll leave it to them to enjoy to their hearts' content.After all, I don't have any special fetish for eavesdropping on people having sex.

Once inside the car, I received a text from my bestie.

""Is your flu any better? My mom made some organic chicken soup. Want me to bring it over?""

In my past life, with Jack on my mind, I immediately turned her down.

But this time, I decided to go with the flow.

After all, having just Jack's mother catch them in the act isn't exciting enough, is it?

When everything was arranged, I was already lying in a hospital bed, silently receiving an antibiotic drip.

...

The apartment's surveillance feed was linked to my phone, allowing me to log in and monitor the situation as it unfolded.

Perhaps because in my past life I had always stayed in the guest room, my view was limited, so I never knew exactly where they indulged in their passion.

Through the surveillance cameras, I could clearly see them frantically coupling on the glass coffee table in the living room.

They even used the bouquet of flowers on the table as a prop in their lovemaking.

Good Lord, those flowers were ones I had personally selected and bought from the florist.

Disgusting...

I nearly threw up everything in my stomach.

This time, Jack's mother seemed to arrive earlier than she had in my previous life.

They hadn't even had time to move to another location when the front door swung open.

""Oh my God! How could you do such a scandalous thing! Have you no shame at all?""

Witnessing this historic scene, I almost burst out laughing.

Jack and Sophia, stark naked, were now frantically searching for clothes to cover themselves.

Just then, my best friend Lily also barged in.

She had always disliked Jack, and upon seeing this scene, she immediately understood what was happening.

""Jack Harrison, you bastard! How dare you do this behind Emma's back!""

Jack clearly hadn't expected to be caught in the act.But he still ""chivalrously"" stood in front of Sophia, shielding her. ""This has nothing to do with Sophia. Don't give her any trouble. If you have a problem, come at me.""

Good, how romantic.

""Boo hoo... Jack, how could this happen? Why did your aunt and Emma's bestie suddenly barge in?""

Sophia fake-cried while cleverly probing for information.

As expected, that birdbrain Jack took the bait immediately.

""Mom, why are you here? Did Emma tattle on me? I never thought she'd be that kind of woman...""

Before Jack could finish, his mother slapped him hard across the face.

""Don't flatter yourself by slandering Emma! She would never stoop so low. Besides, she's your lawful wife. Even if she did report your cheating, wouldn't that be perfectly justified?""

My bestie chimed in fiercely, ""Emma's so sick she can't even get out of bed. I came to bring her some chicken soup. Don't assume everyone's as cold-hearted as you!""

Jack was stunned.

""What? Emma's sick?""

He seemed to realize I might be at home, his expression turning grave.

He hurriedly pulled on his pants and rushed to my room, completely ignoring Sophia as she tried to cling to his arm.

""Jack, darling...""She tried to coax Jack upstairs with a coquettish voice, but ended up getting slapped hard by my best friend.

""Stop acting so disgustingly, seducing someone else's husband. Have you no shame?""

There were no cameras in my room, so I couldn't see Jack's expression.

But when he came back down, he was noticeably calmer.

""You don't need to team up to deceive me. Emma isn't in the bedroom at all. I bet she's just making excuses to play the victim, trying to use you to catch us red-handed.""

My best friend nearly laughed in exasperation.

""Jack, did a mule kick you in the head or something? Who would fake being sick? I'm calling her right now.""

""Go ahead. If it turns out she set this up today to frame me and get you to bully Sophia, I won't let her off easy!""

...

""Enough!"" Jack's mother could no longer contain herself. ""Your wife is sick, and your first reaction isn't concern, but suspicion that she's deceiving you. How did I give birth to such a fool!""

My best friend didn't keep them waiting long, immediately initiating a video call to me on her phone.

I quickly applied foundation to whiten my lips, then slightly messed up my hair to make myself appear more sickly and weak.

Jack heard the sound of the call connecting and, without even looking, began to accuse:

""Emma Harrison, you're getting bolder and bolder, actually pulling this sick act...""

He stopped mid-sentence as he looked at the screen, swallowing the rest of his words.

There was no denying it; I truly looked ill on the screen.

I deliberately coughed a few times, then greeted them in a feeble voice.

""Jack, what are you talking about? cough-cough... Mom and Lily, why are you at the apartment?""

""You... you're really sick? Where are you?""

Jack clearly hadn't anticipated this situation, his questions becoming stuttered.

I smiled weakly, ""In the hospital. It's nothing serious, just a bad cold. I'll be better in a few days.""Jack's mother shot her son a fierce glare. ""Emma, you silly girl. Why didn't you tell me you had such a bad cold? I could've come to take care of you.""

I exchanged pleasantries with Jack's mother, smiling. ""What's going on in the apartment? It looks like a mess in here.""

Of course it was. They'd just had passionate sex. How could the room not be in disarray?

I wanted to steer the conversation in that direction, but for some reason, Jack proactively tried to cover it up.

""Get some rest. I'll come see you tomorrow,"" he said to me, his tone almost gentle.

I laughed bitterly on the inside.

Clearly, when no one else knew, he had no qualms about mistreating me. But now that everything was out in the open, he had to compromise to save face.

At his core, he was someone who cared deeply about his image. Unable to lower himself to officially date his own niece, he chose me as a smokescreen.

I had this man all figured out now.

Having already experienced death, I no longer harbored any affection for him.

Just as my best friend took the phone, ready to chat a bit more, Sophia finally couldn't help but interject:

""Emma, how come you're sick? Is it serious?""

She swiftly leaned into the frame to inquire, deliberately exposing the hickeys on her neck.

She was hoping I'd have a hysterical meltdown, fly into a rage, and completely lose control.This way she could make Jack despise me even more, further deteriorating our relationship.

But I just smiled and said, ""Sophia's back? That's wonderful. I'm too sick to entertain you, so let your uncle keep you company!""

Then I asked her, ""What's with those red marks on your neck? Are you having an allergic reaction?""",1,1752736527.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Unlike traditional team jerseys that stick to club colors, logos, and sponsor designs, anime kits are bold, creative, and often inspired by iconic characters or storylines. You‚Äôll find vibrant color schemes, stylized fonts, and even easter eggs from shows like *Blue Lock*, *Captain Tsubasa*, or *Haikyuu!!* subtly (or not-so-subtly) embedded into the design.

Another major difference is their purpose. While club jerseys are tied to fan loyalty or game-day support, anime kits are more about self-expression and style. They‚Äôre often worn as part of casual outfits, convention gear, or even fashion-forward streetwear looks. A Japanese anime football jersey is something you can wear to a match, then out for coffee or to an anime expo, without feeling out of place.

Some jerseys are even custom-designed by independent artists or brands that specialize in merging anime with football fashion. These versions tend to be limited edition and feel more exclusive compared to mass-produced team kits.

If you're into this kind of crossover style, you can [shop anime football jersey from Fanaacs](https://fanaacs.com/product/japan-x-one-piece-monkey-d-luffy-anime-jersey/), which offers a solid mix of high-quality designs that pay homage to both football and anime fandoms.

My total came out today at 249 cal. So what I ate when I wanted to and I was full. I‚Äôm now 139 pounds. My goal weight is at least 105 because of my height. If I was 125 I would be considered over weight for my height.

My mom has always been over weight so she gets mad a lot when I don‚Äôt want to get coffee or a sweet treat with her. She told me she thinks I‚Äôm over doing it. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do and how to explain to her that I don‚Äôt have an eating disorder. She keeps making comments and watching me make my food when I‚Äôm trying to cook. It pisses me off. 

I‚Äôm honestly just looking for advice to convince her that I don‚Äôt have any eating disorder. Like what can I say to make her believe me? I had a past with sh but I only did it one time. When she saw she got pissed. I don‚Äôt sh any more but I do hit my leg and constantly have a bruise on it, but I don‚Äôt think that counts. Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can say to her to get her off my back.",2,1752736159.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1. The kimchi smells sickly sweet for a few seconds once I open the tub, like something has gone horribly wrong
2. But, if you step back, go down stairs, smell in some coffee, come back up, and smell, its gone. Meaning, the smells dissipates and the kimchi itself smells normal, a bit musty, but normal. Tastes good. 
3. Therefor, the gas emitted by microbial growth contains sweet air born compounds, likely ethyls and alcohols. But these compounds do not stay within the kimchi brine.

It wasn't fancy‚Äîjust a thin band with our initials etched inside‚Äîbut it had been my anchor through the lonely years.

""I'll come back for you, Sarah,"" he'd whispered against my hair at the bus station in Montana. ""Every birthday, I'll bring you home. And if I ever break that promise, I'll live alone forever.""

I checked my phone again. 2:58 PM. Two minutes until our agreed meeting time. My heart hammered against my ribs as I scanned each approaching figure, searching for the tall frame and sandy hair I'd dreamed about every night since he left.

At exactly 3:00, I spotted him. My breath caught. There he was‚ÄîEthan's face, Ethan's height, Ethan's build. But as he walked toward me, something felt... wrong. His gait was stiffer, more measured than the confident stride I remembered. His smile didn't crinkle the corners of his eyes the way it should.

""Sarah,"" he called, and even his voice seemed off‚Äîslightly clipped, with an accent that hadn't been there before. ""You look beautiful.""

I forced a smile as he embraced me, trying to ignore how his arms felt different around my shoulders. Too hesitant. Too formal.

""Ethan,"" I whispered, pulling back to study his face. ""You're really here.""

""Of course."" He touched my cheek, but the gesture felt rehearsed. ""I promised, didn't I?""

We moved to a nearby coffee stall, where he insisted on buying us both lattes. As we sat on a bench overlooking Elliott Bay, I decided to test my growing suspicion.

""Remember that time we hid in old Mr. Peterson's red barn during that thunderstorm?"" I asked, watching his reaction carefully. ""And you told me that ghost story about the headless farmer?""

It was our private joke‚Äîthere had never been a red barn, no Mr. Peterson, no ghost story. The real Ethan would have laughed and called me out immediately.

Instead, he hesitated, his eyes flicking away for just a second before he nodded. ""Oh yes, that old barn. Scary place on a stormy night.""

My stomach twisted into a cold knot. I took a sip of my latte to hide the trembling of my lips.

""You're wearing my ring,"" I noted, gesturing to his left hand where my silver band sat on his ring finger‚Äîupside down. Ethan had always worn it with the engraving facing outward, saying he wanted the world to see our promise.

""I never take it off,"" he replied, but his fingers instinctively moved to adjust it, betraying his discomfort.",0,1752735597.0,romancenovels,0,0.5,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a good sticker goes beyond just the image itself; several critical features contribute to its overall appeal and longevity.

**Material Quality**

The sticker's material directly impacts its durability and lifespan. High-quality vinyl is ofen preferred due to its resistance to water, scratches, and fading from UV exposure. Thicker vinyls generally offer better protection and a more premium feel. Some stickers may also feature additional laminates for enhanced protection and a glossy or matte finish. Careful attention to the type of material used will help ensure that your stickers remain vibrant and intact, regardless of where you choose to display them.

**Print Resolution**

The print resolution determines the clarity and detail within the sticker's design.Higher resolution prints showcase intricate details, sharp lines, and vibrant colors, creating a visually appealing sticker. Low-resolution prints can appear pixelated or blurry, diminishing the overall aesthetic. Ideally,look for stickers with a minimum DPI (dots per inch) of 300 for optimal clarity and detail.**Adhesive Strength**

The adhesive quality is essential for ensuring that the sticker adheres securely to various surfaces without peeling or losing its grip over time. Stickers with strong, permanent adhesives are suitable for surfaces where long-lasting placement is desired. Alternatively, removable or repositionable stickers provide flexibility for temporary applications or frequent adjustments, but may not be as durable. A well-balanced adhesive strikes the right balance between stickiness and ease of removal if necessary.

**Design Accuracy and Originality**

The accuracy of the sticker's depiction of Hazbin Hotel characters and scenes is crucial for authenticity.Stickers should accurately represent the characters' appearances, costumes, and personalities. Original designs or unique interpretations of the source material can add extra appeal for collectors seeking something beyond standard representations. The artist's skill in capturing the show's style is a significant factor.

**Size and Shape Variety**

A diverse range of sizes and shapes can significantly enhance the versatility of your sticker collection. Smaller stickers are ideal for personalizing electronic devices, water bottles, or notebooks, while larger stickers can add a bold statement to laptops, skateboards, or even walls. Unique shapes that contour to the character's design provide a polished and professional look, distinguishing them from generic circle or square stickers.

## FAQs Section

**Are these stickers waterproof and weather resistant?**
The water resistance depends on the material. High-quality vinyl stickers with a laminate layer are typically waterproof and can withstand exposure to rain or moisture without significant damage. However, paper-based stickers are not waterproof and may disintegrate if exposed to water. Always check the product description to confirm the sticker's water resistance.

**How easily can these stickers be removed without damaging the surface?**
Removability depends on the type of adhesive used. Stickers with removable adhesives are designed to be peeled off without leaving residue or damaging the surface. Though, stickers with permanent adhesives might potentially be more difficult to remove and could possibly cause damage, especially on delicate surfaces. Applying heat with a hairdryer can sometiems help soften the adhesive and facilitate easier removal.

**What is the typical lifespan of these stickers when applied indoors versus outdoors?**
Indoor stickers typically last longer than outdoor stickers due to less exposure to harsh elements.Indoors, a high-quality vinyl sticker can maintain its vibrancy and adhesion for several years. Outdoors, exposure to sunlight, rain, and temperature fluctuations can accelerate wear and tear. Outdoor stickers made with UV-resistant inks and durable materials can last for one to three years, depending on the specific conditions and quality of the sticker.

**Are there any environmentally friendly or sustainable sticker options available?**
Yes, some manufacturers offer stickers made from eco-friendly materials like recycled paper or biodegradable vinyl.These options are typically printed with water-based inks that are less harmful to the environment. Look for stickers that are labelled as eco-friendly or sustainable if you want to minimize your environmental impact.

1m20nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1m20nus/my_skeptic_father_still_cant_explain_what_he_saw/,"My skeptic father still can‚Äôt explain what he saw in Navajo Mountain, UT","My father and uncle have a story of living as outsiders (non-native, caucasian) young people on the reservation. Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there‚Äôs a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I‚Äôm mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I‚Äôm just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn‚Äôt too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn‚Äôt much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn‚Äôt the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy‚Äôs face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family‚Äôs home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle‚Äôs bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they‚Äôd seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn‚Äôt have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn‚Äôt explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn‚Äôt much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn‚Äôt meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I‚Äôve never been the same since.",1,1752735289.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn‚Äôt much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn‚Äôt meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I‚Äôve never been the same since.",1,1752735198.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False
1m20lwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumpsandBeyondAu/comments/1m20lwp/positive_birth_and_parenting_workshops_why_i/,Positive Birth and Parenting Workshops - Why I would recommend it for first time and anxious parents,"Hi r/BabyBumpsandBeyondAu crew,



I recently attended a two day birth and parenting workshop at Westmead and was very surprised that only \~20% of birthing parents at the hospital register for it.



It was one of the best decisions made as a first time parent. 



Many of the posts here are from first time parents who are anxious about their pregnancy. We found the classes dispel a lot of the unknowns whist being accessible and comprehensive. After seeing another mother's positive post here under a recent Westmead Public hospital enquiry the following are some notes on how I found the experience:



\* We attended though we would not be birthing at Westmead Hospital

\* The session we attended was run by Laura Tan Bereavement Midwife at Westmead Hospital

\* Both sessions were held on consecutive Saturday's between 09:00-15:00 with a short break and a lunch break during and free coffee and biscuits available

\* Most parents attending were in the 27-33 week range of their pregnancy

\* Parking was discounted onsite for the workshops

\* Several attended via Zoom though I would recommend onsite for the face to face workshop activities, interaction and better visibility compared to the camera's limited field of view

\* Opportunity to visit and see Westmead's birthing unit and inspect and hold some of the medical equipment used

\* It is available to parents not birthing at Westmead Private and similar workshops look to be held at other facilities and also in different languages



The classes involved a mix of approximately \~150 short slides, videos, singles, small and full group activities including hands on and a tour of the Westmead birthing facilities.



What made it beneficial for us was:

\* The structure of the course, though informative, was based on a foundation of physical, emotional and mental support as individuals, partners and external help options

\* There were sessions where both partners were encouraged to openly communicate, provide feedback, assist and reassure each other and gain a better understanding of each others roles

\* The course covered everything including the four stages of pregnancy, what to expect, challenges that may occur and solutions from a modern day standpoint (nice complimentary or counterpoint to family and friends advice 'how I did it')

\* Appreciating other attending parents circumstances, views, strategies, struggles and challenges and not feeling like an island in the middle of the ocean

\* The opportunity to ask an experienced midwife questions no matter how big or small and get both her perspective as well as other parents she had been provided feedback with

\* The opportunity to visit the birthing unit as mentioned above and practical lessons including handling equipment and models

\* There was many contacts and resources for first and third party support during and post pregnancy

\* It never felt boring despite the amount of content covered



In the last few years there has been several couples I have met who ran into difficulties with their pregnancies have lessened in impact with the above. In one example, the couple attended one of two classes and the missed content covered what occurred - how initial contractions were not an indicator of an imminent delivery, how they were told to go home and then later what would happen when they had to rush back. In another there was a quick turn towards emergency caesarean - something the couple was unprepared yet would of had a higher chance of due to the mother's age and health conditions. I can only imagine what some mothers may feel when presented with a not so straightforward birth and seeing some of the instruments, apparatus, rooms, etc for the first time.

I think it suited us as despite reading a lot of comments, watching videos, reading books and speaking to families and friends it was comforting to have a more hands on experience.

1m20lrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m20lrx/three_years_of_marriage_and_all_i_got_was_his/,"Three years of marriage, and all I got was his betrayal. _ One of Celeste Adams‚Äôs students hadn‚Äôt turned in a single assignment all semester.","One of Celeste Adams‚Äôs students hadn‚Äôt turned in a single assignment all semester. So she docked her participation grade.

That afternoon, her desk was trashed by a group of people.

Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she‚Äôd stayed up grading.

Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke‚Äîbut just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.

Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôve already settled the socre for you. As long as I‚Äôm around, no one‚Äôs going to lay a finger on you.‚Äù

Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Sullivan‚Ä¶ If it weren‚Äôt for you, I‚Äôd be eaten alive at school. I don‚Äôt even know how to repay you.‚Äù

Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. ‚ÄúThen repay me with a kiss. Deal?‚Äù

Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.

‚ÄúThis is just a thank-you‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying yes to you.‚Äù She whispered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.‚Äù

Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. ‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll wait.‚Äù

Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.

...

She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, ‚ÄúCeleste, I‚Äôll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.‚Äù

And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of ‚Äúforever‚Äù?

Once Vanessa was gone‚Äîback to her dorm‚ÄîCeleste finally walked up to Lucian‚Äôs car, her face pale.

Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.

When he saw her, he clearly froze. ‚ÄúCeleste?‚Äù

‚ÄúLucian Sullivan.‚Äù Her voice shook. ‚ÄúYou and her‚Ä¶ how long has this been going on?‚Äù

Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a smoke ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes‚Äîeyes designed to break hearts.

‚ÄúWell, since you‚Äôve found out, I won‚Äôt bother hiding it.‚Äù His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. ‚ÄúYou only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime‚Äîthe party's over.""

‚ÄúI do love you, Celeste. But don‚Äôt expect me to love only you. That gets boring.‚Äù

‚ÄúVanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I‚Äôm intrigued. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not planning to divorce you. When I‚Äôm done having fun, I‚Äôll come back to you.‚Äù

Celeste felt her heart twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.‚Äù

A frown snapped onto Lucian‚Äôs face, his voice turning icy. ‚ÄúStop overreacting. I‚Äôve made myself clear. I‚Äôll spend most of the rest of my life with you‚Äîas long as you‚Ä¶‚Äù

He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. ‚ÄúBehave. And stop bothering my girl.‚Äù

With that, he let go and walked away.

Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.

She‚Äôd heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy‚Äîmen playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.

But she‚Äôd never thought Lucian would become one of them.

Because he had once loved her so deeply.

So deeply he‚Äôd insisted on marrying her‚Äîa nobody teacher‚Äôs daughter‚Äîeven against the Sullivan family‚Äôs objections. So deeply he‚Äôd stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days‚Ä¶

On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.

Turns out, ‚Äúthe rest of his life‚Äù ended way sooner than she expected.

Celeste didn‚Äôt even remember how she got home.

She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.

When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her chest.

Her eyes flew open‚Äîshe was suspended inside a massive glass tank, wrists shackled above her head, and the water level was steadily rising.

Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.

The firelight danced on his handsome profile‚Äîbut none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.

‚ÄúLucian‚Ä¶!‚Äù she struggled, water splashing everywhere. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou went to Vanessa,‚Äù he said coldly. ‚ÄúTold her to stay away from me.‚Äù

The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. ‚ÄúSo she deleted all my contacts.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is your punishment. Remember this lesson.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt!‚Äù Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. ‚ÄúI never even saw her after I went home!‚Äù

‚ÄúStill lying?‚Äù Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. ‚ÄúIncrease the water.‚Äù

The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.

Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.

Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. ‚ÄúI told you‚ÄîI love you. Just give me ten years, and I‚Äôll come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut first, stop going after Vanessa.‚Äù

And with that, he turned and left.

‚ÄúLucian! Lucian‚Äî!‚Äù

Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.

The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.

On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes‚Äî

That school trip years ago, when she‚Äôd fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.

The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.

The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached‚Ä¶

But now, it had all gone up in smoke.

By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn‚Äôt even stand.

She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up‚Äî

Vanessa had updated her social feed.

‚ÄúFirst time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~‚Äù

The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.

Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed‚Äîwhile tears fell onto the screen.

She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.

Lucian didn‚Äôt return until that night.

Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs grab dinner. I‚Äôll make it up to you, okay?‚Äù

He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over now. I‚Äôm just gonna be with her for ten years. Don‚Äôt go looking for trouble again.‚Äù

Celeste looked up, calm. ‚ÄúFine. But you need to sign something.‚Äù

She handed him a document. ‚ÄúA contract promising you‚Äôll come back to the family after ten years.‚Äù

Lucian didn‚Äôt even glance at it before signing.

‚ÄúHappy now?‚Äù He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.

Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù

She was happy.

Because he hadn‚Äôt realized‚Äîwhat he signed wasn‚Äôt a promise to return.

It was a divorce agreement...

# Chapter 2

Just as Lucian Sullivan finished signing his name, his phone rang.

His assistant, Connor‚Äôs voice came through the phone speaker. ‚ÄúMr. Sullivan, Ms. Clarke twisted her ankle. She‚Äôs in a lot of pain and can‚Äôt walk‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lucian‚Äôs expression shifted slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù

He put the phone away and looked at Celeste. ‚ÄúVanessa got hurt. I need to go check on her. Rain check on dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother.‚Äù Celeste clenched the divorce papers in her hand. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to keep me company anymore.‚Äù

Lucian frowned like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned and left.

Celeste headed straight to a law office. The attorney flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs valid. The divorce will be finalized after the mandatory 30-day waiting period..‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

Leaving the firm, Celeste went back to Ashbourne University. In the Dean‚Äôs office, she handed in her resignation letter.

‚ÄúCeleste?‚Äù Dean Walker looked up in surprise. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of our best instructors. Why are you suddenly quitting?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting divorced,‚Äù Celeste replied calmly. ‚ÄúI want to leave this city.‚Äù

Dean Walker sighed. ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ finish the last few classes this semester, then you can go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

Celeste stepped out of the office and took a deep breath.

For her final class, she pulled herself together and walked into the lecture hall‚Äîonly to spot Lucian and Vanessa sitting in the back corner.

Lucian, dressed in a crisp suit, lounged in the last row. Vanessa leaned against his shoulder. The two of them whispered and giggled, fingers entwined.

Celeste felt a sharp pain in her chest.

Lucian used to be a complete workaholic‚Äîhe had cut their honeymoon short after just three days to rush back to the office. And now, he was skipping billion-dollar deals just to sit in on a random elective class with Vanessa?

She took another breath, walked to the front of the class, and began. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre reading Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets‚Ä¶‚Äù

Throughout the entire lecture, laughter kept floating from the back row.

Lucian‚Äôs low chuckles. Vanessa‚Äôs coquettish replies. Each sound stabbed Celeste like a knife.

The second the class ended, she practically bolted out of the classroom.

In the restroom, she splashed cold water on her face. She was just about to leave when she heard Vanessa‚Äôs voice coming from one of the stalls.

‚ÄúLucian gave up a billion-dollar contract just to chase after me‚Äîand even sat through class with me!‚Äù she bragged on the phone. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve seen the way he was looking at me‚Äîlike he wanted to devour me.‚Äù

A girl on the other end asked, ‚ÄúIf he likes you that much, why haven‚Äôt you said yes yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you dumb?‚Äù Vanessa scoffed. ‚ÄúGuys like him? They‚Äôre surrounded by women. The only way to keep them hooked is to string them along‚Äîhot and cold.‚Äù

She lowered her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking to be some kept woman. I want to be Mrs. Sullivan.‚Äù

Celeste stood rooted in place, nails digging into her palm.

Expressionless, she walked out of the restroom and passed right by Vanessa.

‚ÄúProfessor Adams!‚Äù Vanessa scrambled to hang up and rushed after her, grabbing her arm. ‚ÄúWhat did you hear?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù Celeste jerked her hand away. ‚ÄúWhatever it is, it‚Äôs none of my business.‚Äù

Vanessa still wanted to follow up, but out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lucian approaching.

Her eyes flickered, and without warning, she grabbed Celeste‚Äôs wrist and slapped herself‚Äîhard.

Smack!

The sharp crack of a slap echoed harshly down the hallway.

‚ÄúProfessor‚Ä¶‚Äù Vanessa covered her face, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice trembling with grievance. ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôll stay far away from Mr. Sullivan from now on‚Ä¶ Please don‚Äôt be mad at me‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lucian stormed over, his face thunderous. ‚ÄúCeleste! You signed the damn agreement! Why are you still bullying Vanessa?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Celeste looked at him calmly. ‚ÄúShe slapped herself.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Sullivan‚Ä¶‚Äù Vanessa whimpered, shrinking into his arms. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ maybe you should stop pursuing me. Professor Adams is so angry. I‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lucian immediately pulled her into his arms. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. She doesn‚Äôt get to decide what I do.‚Äù

Vanessa‚Äôs eyes were red and watery as she whispered, ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs still your wife. She forced me to stay away from you‚Ä¶ and she slapped me‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her voice broke, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been treated like this before‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lucian‚Äôs eyes darkened. He gently touched her cheek where it had turned red, his voice soft.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be upset. I'll let you get back at her tenfold, okay?‚Äù

# Chapter 3

Vanessa feigned panic. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I really shouldn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs your wife. And she‚Äôs my professor‚Ä¶ How could I ever hit my teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let the bodyguards do it.‚Äù Lucian‚Äôs voice remained gentle‚Äîwhile saying the cruelest words. ‚ÄúThat way you won‚Äôt have to get your hands dirty.‚Äù

Celeste‚Äôs pupils contracted, staring in disbelief at the man who once shielded her from the world. ‚ÄúLucian‚Ä¶ do you even hear yourself right now?‚Äù

Lucian didn‚Äôt even spare her a glance. He raised his hand and gave the order. ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù

Two towering bodyguards stepped forward and slammed her against the wall, pinning her in place.

Smack!

The first slap exploded against her cheek. A sharp ringing filled Celeste‚Äôs ears.

In a daze, she saw a memory from years ago‚Äîa stormy night when Lucian had once stood in front of her like a shield, growling, ‚ÄúTouch her and I‚Äôll make you wish you were dead.‚Äù

Smack!

The second slap shattered the memory. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, staining her pale lips red.

Through the haze, she saw Lucian gently covering Vanessa‚Äôs eyes, whispering softly in her ear.

Vanessa let out a playful little squeal and lightly punched his chest.

‚Ä¶

By the tenth slap, Celeste could no longer feel the pain. Her body gave out, collapsing to the ground as stifled gasps of horror rippled through the students nearby.

Through blurry vision, she saw Lucian say gently to Vanessa, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go get sushi at that place you love.‚Äù

Students in the hallway whispered behind cupped hands, ‚ÄúGod‚Ä¶ poor Professor Adams‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could Mr. Sullivan do that to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat girl is disgusting. She slapped herself!‚Äù

Celeste propped herself up against the wall and slowly stood.

Her face throbbed, each step like a blade slicing into her skin.

But what was this pain compared to the gaping wound in her heart‚Äîraw, bleeding, torn open like someone had clawed through it.

She had thought‚Ä¶ even if Lucian no longer loved her, he‚Äôd at least show some shred of compassion for the past they shared.

But he actually had her slapped ten times in front of the crowd, all for Vanessa.

As she stepped out the school gates, the autumn wind stung her bruised face. She gasped in pain.

Back at home, she stood before the mirror and stared at her wretched reflection. Her face was swollen, lips split, blood still dried at the edges.

And suddenly‚Äîshe laughed.

Laughed until fat tears spilled down her cheeks.

It took her three days to heal the wounds on her face before she could go back to school like nothing had happened.

As soon as she stepped into her office, her phone rang. Dean Walker‚Äôs voice came through.

‚ÄúCeleste, Vanessa Clarke skipped several midterm exams. As her academic advisor, you need to follow up with her.‚Äù

Celeste opened Vanessa‚Äôs social feed.

The latest post showed her at an auction, a priceless diamond necklace draped around her neck, with the caption: Mr. Sullivan said this necklace suits me perfectly\~

Scrolling further, it was all pictures of her and Lucian out at lavish venues: private yachts, Michelin-starred restaurants, equestrian clubs‚Ä¶

Celeste dialed Vanessa‚Äôs number.

The background music was loud. Vanessa‚Äôs cheerful voice answered, ‚ÄúHello? Professor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou missed your midterm exams,‚Äù Celeste said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúDean Walker asked me to check in with you..‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that,‚Äù Vanessa giggled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a few exams. You‚Äôre close with the Dean‚Äîcan‚Äôt you just enter some grades for me?‚Äù

She paused, then added smugly, ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs too much trouble, I‚Äôll have Mr. Sullivan donate a few buildings. Problem solved, right?‚Äù

Lucian‚Äôs low laughter echoed from the background. ‚ÄúHaving fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúMm-hmm\~‚Äù Vanessa cooed back. Then she added to Celeste, ‚ÄúProfessor, if it‚Äôs nothing urgent, don‚Äôt call again. We‚Äôre busy enjoying ourselves.‚Äù

Click. The call ended.

Celeste gave a bitter laugh and set her phone down. She didn‚Äôt bother following up.

That evening, as she headed home, she spotted Lucian in the front yard of the mansion, personally teaching Vanessa how to drive.

‚ÄúRelax your grip on the wheel. Don‚Äôt be nervous.‚Äù He stood beside the driver's seat, leaning down close to Vanessa, his voice impossibly soft. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid. I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù

The scene pierced through Celeste like a blade.

Once, he had taught her to drive exactly like this.

When she fumbled and nearly hit a guardrail, he had only laughed and pinched her cheek. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs there to be afraid of? I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù

Now he was saying the exact same words to another girl.

‚ÄúTry it on your own,‚Äù Lucian said, stepping back.

Vanessa bit her lip. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll hit someone‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Lucian said, gently ruffling her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù

Reassured, Vanessa pressed the accelerator.

And then‚Äîshe suddenly swerved straight at Celeste.

BAM!

Celeste was thrown into the air and slammed to the ground.

Blood spread beneath her, soaking the pavement.

Through the pain, she saw Lucian rushing toward her.

But the first thing he did was pull the panicked Vanessa into his arms. ‚ÄúAre you okay? Did it scare you?‚Äù

Celeste lay in a pool of blood, her vision darkening.

‚Ä¶

When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake?‚Äù Lucian stood at her bedside, face calm. ‚ÄúThe doctor said you‚Äôve fractured a few ribs. Don‚Äôt go back to work. Just rest.‚Äù

Celeste opened her mouth, but the pain in her chest silenced her. She could only glare at him with bloodshot eyes.

‚ÄúVanessa didn‚Äôt mean to hit you,‚Äù Lucian continued. ‚ÄúShe just started learning. She panicked.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶ did it... on purpose‚Ä¶‚Äù Through the pain, Celeste forced each word between through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúI was nowhere near her‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lucian‚Äôs brows knit together, his tone turning impatient. ‚ÄúCeleste, what exactly do you want?‚Äù

Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there‚Äôs a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I‚Äôm mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I‚Äôm just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn‚Äôt too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn‚Äôt much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn‚Äôt the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy‚Äôs face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family‚Äôs home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle‚Äôs bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they‚Äôd seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn‚Äôt have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn‚Äôt explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn‚Äôt much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn‚Äôt meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I‚Äôve never been the same since.",1,1752734835.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1m20f73,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1m20f73/is_this_projection_or_something_else/,Is this projection or something else?,"You know the saying ‚Äúif you ran into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you‚Äôre the asshole‚Äù?

I feel like that‚Äôs my life lately, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the asshole. Of course, no one wants to want to think of themselves as the asshole, but I feel like people have been accusing me of behavior that they‚Äôre engaging in, and if I try to reflect that back to them it‚Äôs seen as me doing more of the same.

Here‚Äôs an example. 

My partner and I got into an argument. We were having a great morning, but we have a 5 year old, so he just wears you down. We were trying to come up with our plan for the day and I needed to pick a library book up and she asked me what book it was. Our son was talking over us and interrupting us the entire time so I could barely get a word out and I was so exhausted I could not remember what the book was and I let out an exasperated ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!‚Äù

She responded by scrunching her face up in annoyance and I was taken aback because I didn‚Äôt understand why that annoyed her, and I genuinely could not think about whay the book was, so I asked her why she was annoyed. She tried telling me but our kid kept talking and I brought out my ‚Äústern voice‚Äù, and told him to stop interrupting us, and then she got upset with me and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just a kid‚Äù etc etc. 

This situation was clearly becoming argumentative and I told her I couldn‚Äôt do this right now, and I needed to take a step back so I wasn‚Äôt so reactive. She receives that as me trying to suppress her speaking and sort of doubles down and gets even more upset and defensive and doesn‚Äôt let me leave the conversation. 

So when she wouldn‚Äôt let me leave, I just lost it. To be clear I have no recollection of losing it as I dissociate, but I know I yelled and said some horrible shit. I know that what I did was not okay at all, and I fully regret it. 

I ended up leaving the house and kind of came to at the park, etc. 

We started texting and I basically told her if she had left me alone this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm blaming her for my behavior, I‚Äôm ultimately responsible for that, but I was trying to point out how I set a boundary and was trying to leave the conversation so it didn‚Äôt escalate and she wouldn‚Äôt allow that. She just *has* to say what she needs to say, you know. 

And then the conversation becomes how I‚Äôm always blaming her, I don‚Äôt take responsibility for myself etc, etc. 

But from my perspective she isn‚Äôt taking responsibility for herself. She‚Äôs projecting what she‚Äôs doing on to me.

And then she goes and tells her friends that I do this stuff and then I‚Äôm the bad guy, I‚Äôm the guy who‚Äôs bringing her down, who blames everyone else, who isn‚Äôt honest with himself, who‚Äôs never going to change, who‚Äôs not good enough for her, who can only bring her down etc.

And all of this occurred after I had made breakfast and coffee for everyone, she actually slept in while I was up with her son and she got to wake up to breakfast and coffee, and then we all went outside and hung out for a while and she was just gushing about how great I am. 

There was another time where something similar happened, and she accused me of doing nothing to better myself. I have a health condition and am working with my doctors, following treatment, living a healthy lifestyle, in therapy, and seeking alternative treatments etc. But morning is working and it‚Äôs getting worse and one argument she told me I wasn‚Äôt doing anything to better myself, and when k asked her what she meant she said I was just depressed and needed to be on medication.

Then she tells her friends and I‚Äôm the person who‚Äôs unwilling to help myself or better myself. 

And no matter how much I try to argue against, that it‚Äôs not depression and I have a legitimate diagnosed medical issue, she thinks I‚Äôm depressed, and I‚Äôm just in denial, it‚Äôs like the harder I try to press the issue, the more in denial or projecting I‚Äôm being portrayed as.

It‚Äôs like her and her friends and family see me one way, and no matter what I do, every action cements me as that person, even though in my perspective she‚Äôs the one in the wrong. Or at least she‚Äôs not seeing things as they are. 

Like after the ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù argument, we talked and I thought we came to an understanding, but months later I get the same thing from her again, and again. No matter what I say or do she has her mind made up and any attempt on my part to try and get her to see things my way is seen as me being in denial. 

Even typing this, it just sounds and feels so fucked up, like it makes me feel insane. 

But it‚Äôs not just my partner, it‚Äôs like every everyone of my life keeps saying that I am or I‚Äôm being a certain way and then if I try to refute it, they say I‚Äôm in denial, even though I don‚Äôt see it the way that they do or feel like I feel the way they think I do.  Like all of my doctors think I‚Äôm just depressed, even though I have elevated markers of enzymes associated with muscle loss, and markers associated with autoimmune disorders. And the more I try to emphasize on what I think the problem is, which is my health issues, the more they think I‚Äôm in denial about being depressed, and I‚Äôm not denying that I have depression, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the cause of my issues. It feels like my issues are the cause of my depression, but if I say that, then I‚Äôm just being perceived as I‚Äôm in denial.

So back to the original analogy, it feels like I‚Äôm the ‚Äúrun into assholes all day, you‚Äôre the asshole‚Äù guy to everyone else around me, but to me it feels like ‚Äúif you run into assholes all day, you ran into asshole, there‚Äôs 8 billion people in the world and alot of people are assholes‚Äù

Medyo madami akong struggles na naranasan at a young age. I was able to get through all of them but right now, parang pagod agad ako and I feel guilty na ganito nararamdaman ko dahil kahit papaano, alam kong mas fortunate ako kesa sa ibang tao. Pero nattest ni Lord yung ptience ko sa paghintay ng kung kailan ba yung winning season ko.

I have experienced na mapag aral ng ibang kamag anak na nasa ibang bansa during high school, mag hiwalay yung mga magulang ans magkabalikan after 3 years, magkaron at makasama sa bahay ang mga adik na kamag anak habang nakikitira ako sa kanila, kumain ng toyo lang, mangutang sa tindahan and walang pambayad, tumigil ng pag aaral, makulong ang magulang (pero nakalaya din naman at not guilty after 3 years - pangit ng sistema ng batas sa Pinas), victim ng SA ng cousin (habang nakikitira sa kanila), mga nagkakasakit sa family (mostly cancer), mamatayan ng family member at mamamtayan ng furbaby. Sa 32 years ko na nabubuhay, parang naghihintay ako ng kahit paano bigyan ako ng Diyos ng kahit mga straight na 5 years man lang na walang serious dagok yung buhay ko. Nakaahon ahon naman kahit pano. Tinyaga ko na makagraduate ng HS sa tulong ng iba‚Äôt ibang kamag anak, and napa graduate naman ako ng mga magulang ko ng college nung medyo nakabawi na kami sa buhay financially. Ngayon na nagttrabaho na ako, naranasan ko naman na madaming kaibigan yung mawala sakin dahil sa pera. Either siniraan ako sa trabaho, niloko ako sa pera, or kaya nung medyo sumakses naman ako eh tinrato naman akong kakompetensya. Parang curse din na maging considerate dito sa mundo kasi natetake advantage lang naman. 

Ngayon, pagod na ako agad kahit na 10+ years pa lang ako nagttrabaho. Nakakafrustrate pa lalo na sa pagod mo magtrabaho, parang di mo ramdam dahil sa taxes, parang di mo ramdam yung binabayad mo. Yung paligid, parang mas nabibigyan pa ng reward yung ibang di naman naghihirap. Napapagod na ko na magbayad ng bills. Nakakapagod na makipag kaibigan sa mga bagong tao. Nakakapagod na makisama. Yung ganito ba, mid-life crisis na kahit ilang taon pa lang ako? 

Sana bigyan ako ng Diyos ng isang shot lang na magkaron ng malaking pera. Para makapagpatayo na lang ako ng apartment, makatravel, makabigay ng tulong sa pamilya pang negosyo, makabayad ng ibang mga debts, at mapatapos ko ng pag aaral yung kapatid ko. Tapos magkaron na lang ako ng coffee shop sa tapat ng dagat. Sana madali na lang yung buhay. Ang mahal at ang hirap mabuhay.",33,1752733988.0,OffMyChestPH,15,0.93,False

guys should i quit
i 16F work at a small ice cream shop that also sells bubble waffles, croffles, coffee, refreshers, and other random stuff. my friend (we‚Äôll call her L) who also works there encouraged me to apply and hyped me up to the owner, peter (aka the world‚Äôs most dramatic micromanager), and after he hired me, she kept reassuring me that he was so nice and that‚Äôs she loves him he‚Äôs just bad with pay because he ‚Äúforgets‚Äù but that she doesn‚Äôt care (and even had the audacity to say she should be grateful he even pays her like wow talk abt low self esteem) 
like girl. be serious.
we‚Äôre supposed to get paid biweekly, but peter doesn‚Äôt actually pay anyone unless you ask him for your paycheck, and even then it‚Äôs a struggle. even my friend L admitted he hasn‚Äôt paid her in over two months, but she weirdly doesn‚Äôt care because she‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ obsessed with him for some reason?? idk she acts like he can do no wrong.
 
oh and also he‚Äôs supposed to give us our tips as a seperate check at the end of the month and it‚Äôs july 16 and we haven‚Äôt gotten our june tips‚Ä¶

anyway, here‚Äôs the full breakdown of what this man has put me through in the short time i‚Äôve worked here:

‚òÄÔ∏è june 12 (first day)- july 31‚Äì the good era
	‚Ä¢	i actually loved the job at first
	‚Ä¢	i was working with the other girls and they were teaching me everything
	‚Ä¢	the vibes were fun, i felt supported, and i was learning at a good pace
	‚Ä¢	peter wasn‚Äôt really there much, which the girls said was normal, apparently he‚Äôs usually not super hands-on
	‚Ä¢	i was genuinely doing well and proud of myself
	‚Ä¢	and then‚Ä¶ everything changed.
üíú july 1, the ube latte incident (everything went to hell)
	‚Ä¢	i texted peter about my paycheck since it had been two weeks and i wanted my money (very normal thing to do, sorry babes but u need to pay me)
	‚Ä¢	he paid me at the start of my next shift but suddenly got cold and rude
	‚Ä¢	then he started quizzing me on the menu like it was a pop exam, even though i was still new and hadn‚Äôt memorized everything yet bc i had only been there for 6 shifts at that point 
	‚Ä¢	then he made me make an ube latte on the spot in front of him to ‚Äúprove‚Äù i knew how
	‚Ä¢	i made it, but i didn‚Äôt use exact measurements because i was never taught them
	‚Ä¢	after watching me make the drink, he angrily accused me of lying about knowing how to make it
	‚Ä¢	said i ‚Äúshould‚Äôve just said i didn‚Äôt know how‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	told me i needed to ‚Äúbe honest‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	made me feel like i did something wrong when i was literally just doing what i‚Äôd been shown
	‚Ä¢	ever since that day, he started treating me completely differently, like i was incompetent and lying about everything
üö© post-ube latte era (aka the villain arc)
	‚Ä¢he started only scheduling me with him, no more shifts with the girls as an attempt to ‚Äútrain‚Äù me
	‚Ä¢literally every shift since then has been just me and him, except for one
	‚Ä¢it‚Äôs super obvious he was isolating me to try to control and micromanage me
	‚Ä¢he never trained me properly, but still expected me to know everything
	‚Ä¢when he did ‚Äútrain‚Äù me, it was just him being passive aggressive, cold, and constantly critical

‚ùÑÔ∏è july 5, the slushie/car incident
kinda small but i still found it so weird :
	‚Ä¢he made me follow a random man all the way to his car to hold his slushies (and girl it wasn‚Äôt close it was a WALK away from the store i could‚Äôve gotten snatched)
	‚Ä¢instead of giving the man a bag or handing him the order himself (LIKE A GROWN MAN), he sent me, a teenage girl, to follow a stranger to his car
	‚Ä¢it felt super uncomfortable for both me and that poor guy who clearly didn‚Äôt want me to do that, and i felt super unsafe. did my boss care tho? no.
üî• july 7 ‚Äî the bubble waffle disaster (first one)
	‚Ä¢	he was rude to me the entire shift
	‚Ä¢	he got a huge bubble waffle online order from his online shop (that i didn‚Äôt sign up to work in tf i signed up to work in ur in person shop but whatever) and made me (THE ONE WHO HASNT BEEN TAUGHT THE BUBBLE WAFFLES YET) help make them (wow what an excellent idea üòç)
	‚Ä¢	again i‚Äôd literally never been taught how to make them before and they‚Äôre super hard to make without breaking them when ur pulling it out of the bubble waffle maker 
	‚Ä¢	i was trying my best to follow his lead, but he kept acting like i was incompetent
	‚Ä¢	it was overwhelming and discouraging
	‚Ä¢	also, still no tips from june at this point and it‚Äôs already july 7, but i didn‚Äôt say anything. 

üßä july 16 ‚Äî the day it hit a breaking point
	‚Ä¢	hadn‚Äôt been scheduled in a week, then suddenly put on with just him again
	‚Ä¢	started off the shift showing me how to put ice cream in a pint, and when i tried for the first time, he snapped and said:
‚Äúit‚Äôs not that hard, i don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt do it‚Äù over and over 
	‚Ä¢	i did it perfectly right after that like 3 times, and he didn‚Äôt say a word
	‚Ä¢	all shift, he only spoke to me to criticize and talk down to me
	‚Ä¢	kept saying:
‚Äúyou‚Äôre not up to our standards‚Äù
‚Äúyou‚Äôre not up to par‚Äù
‚Äúyou should already know this‚Äù
over and over again like bitch calm down 
	‚Ä¢	kept quizzing me on menu items again, acting like it was insane i didn‚Äôt have it all memorized
	‚Ä¢	even though none of the other girls have everything memorized either
	‚Ä¢	got another huge bubble waffle online order and had me make it again bc he‚Äôs so intelligent and that‚Äôs a great idea 
	‚Ä¢	again, i‚Äôve never been properly taught
	‚Ä¢	the waffle iron is burning hot and i had to pry them out with my bare hands
	‚Ä¢	my fingers were burning, and he didn‚Äôt care ‚Äî just got mad at me for ‚Äúnot doing it right‚Äù
üßΩ closing time trauma: THE FINAL STRAW 
	‚Ä¢	i stayed 20 minutes after closing, mopping and doing dishes
	‚Ä¢	he comes up to me and says:
‚Äúso how are you feeling today?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	i thought he was trying to be nice or start a conversation for once, so i said ‚Äúgood! how about you? :)‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	and he hits me with:
‚Äúi‚Äôm frustrated with you. my mood depends on you.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢ GIRL WHAT?! my man blames his entire mood on a girl just trying to clean up
	‚Ä¢	then he asks who i like working with
	‚Ä¢	i said this one other girl and L (because duh)
	‚Ä¢	he then took that as an opportunity to start talking trash about L, saying how he‚Äôs upset at her bc she described me a certain way and that i haven‚Äôt lived up to that, and saying that she didn‚Äôt train me properly in the beginning 

‚Ä¢ kept saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not what she described you as. she described as a great worker and organized and this but that i‚Äôm not seeing that.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ (at this point this has probably been his like 15th insult towards me the whole shift. ik you guys won‚Äôt believe me but i was NOT doing as bad as he was describing me. i think i was actually doing pretty well except for the bubble waffles.) 
	‚Ä¢	basically made me feel like a complete disappointment, like i‚Äôve been wasting his time
	‚Ä¢	and then‚Ä¶ the final final straw

paycheck + tip drama
	‚Ä¢	i asked him about my june tips, since it‚Äôs now july 16
	‚Ä¢	he said they‚Äôd be included in my july 15 paycheck
	‚Ä¢	i told him ‚Äúit‚Äôs the 16th‚Ä¶ and i didn‚Äôt get paid.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	he stammered and said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time to do payroll‚Äù because he‚Äôs been training me (???)
	‚Ä¢	then asked:
‚Äúdo you have money problems or something?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	like‚Ä¶ belittling me for asking for my own earned money

üíÄ overall:
	‚Ä¢	he isolates me, under-trained me then isolated me and bullied me and calling it ‚Äútraining‚Äù, expects perfection, and shames me when i fall short
	‚Ä¢	he doesn‚Äôt treat any of the other girls like this
	‚Ä¢	he talks to me in a way that‚Äôs meant to tear me down, not build me up
	‚Ä¢	the shifts feel like punishment, not a job
	‚Ä¢	and all of this started because i didn‚Äôt make an ube latte the way he wanted it

so yeah should i quit or am i being dramatic  
i kinda feel bad bc if i leave after a month ill make my friend look bad for hyping me up and im afraid he‚Äôll target her now ",1,1752733822.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Looking to aquire a router because I'm venturing into making some basic bits of furniture like foot stools, table lamps, coffee tables etc.

Whats everyones opinion on the limitations of a 1/4"" router?? 

Im eyeing off the dewalt 900w premium plunge and fixed based router combination:

What I'm hoping to get out of it is a tool that achieves nice roundovers and detailing but also I will be cutting mortise and tennons for legs and Im sure the occasional butterfly join. Is there really a requirement for a 1/2"" router for mortises like some sites say?

If its useful information, timber I'll be looking at working with is Australian hardwooda including ironbark (very hard) to like spotted gum, black butt and black wattle.

I only had 1 one day to watch the training videos (and I didn't even get to watch all of them) and I was using my friends account to watch them (cause their training website was down or something). When I first went in, it started off well. I was observing my trainer when she was using the pos system and I got to make a few drinks with her help. This went on for about an hour and a half until the supervisor pulled me aside and said I should only focus on taking the customers orders. 

She helped me out with the pos system for the first 3 customers and then she left me on my own. Of course I was panicking cause I didn't know how to use the pos system and customers were getting impatient cause I was trying to catch their orders while figuring out the pos system. They said I can always ask for help, but most of them time they were all very busy which only made me hold up the line even more. I was also making drinks, taking donuts, timbits, other pastries, and I'm still trying to figure the time when to brew all the different types of coffees and the steeped tea.  


Is this normal? I was talking with a coworker and they said, ""I would have never survived being alone on the first day"" and others kept praising me on how well I was doing for my first day, and to me, that indicated that it shouldn't be the case where a trainee is left all on their own.

So she docked her participation grade.



That afternoon, her desk was trashed by a group of people.



Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she‚Äôd stayed up grading.



Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.



She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke‚Äîbut just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.



Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôve already settled the socre for you. As long as I‚Äôm around, no one‚Äôs going to lay a finger on you.‚Äù



Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Sullivan‚Ä¶ If it weren‚Äôt for you, I‚Äôd be eaten alive at school. I don‚Äôt even know how to repay you.‚Äù



Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. ‚ÄúThen repay me with a kiss. Deal?‚Äù



Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.



‚ÄúThis is just a thank-you‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying yes to you.‚Äù She whispered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.‚Äù



Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. ‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll wait.‚Äù



Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.



...



She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, ‚ÄúCeleste, I‚Äôll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.‚Äù



And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of ‚Äúforever‚Äù?



Once Vanessa was gone‚Äîback to her dorm‚ÄîCeleste finally walked up to Lucian‚Äôs car, her face pale.



Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.



When he saw her, he clearly froze. ‚ÄúCeleste?‚Äù



‚ÄúLucian Sullivan.‚Äù Her voice shook. ‚ÄúYou and her‚Ä¶ how long has this been going on?‚Äù



Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a smoke ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes‚Äîeyes designed to break hearts.



‚ÄúWell, since you‚Äôve found out, I won‚Äôt bother hiding it.‚Äù His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. ‚ÄúYou only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime‚Äîthe party's over.""



‚ÄúI do love you, Celeste. But don‚Äôt expect me to love only you. That gets boring.‚Äù



‚ÄúVanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I‚Äôm intrigued. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not planning to divorce you. When I‚Äôm done having fun, I‚Äôll come back to you.‚Äù



Celeste felt her heart twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.‚Äù



A frown snapped onto Lucian‚Äôs face, his voice turning icy. ‚ÄúStop overreacting. I‚Äôve made myself clear. I‚Äôll spend most of the rest of my life with you‚Äîas long as you‚Ä¶‚Äù



He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. ‚ÄúBehave. And stop bothering my girl.‚Äù



With that, he let go and walked away.



Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.



She‚Äôd heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy‚Äîmen playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.



But she‚Äôd never thought Lucian would become one of them.



Because he had once loved her so deeply.



So deeply he‚Äôd insisted on marrying her‚Äîa nobody teacher‚Äôs daughter‚Äîeven against the Sullivan family‚Äôs objections. So deeply he‚Äôd stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days‚Ä¶



On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.



Turns out, ‚Äúthe rest of his life‚Äù ended way sooner than she expected.



Celeste didn‚Äôt even remember how she got home.



She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.



When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her chest.



Her eyes flew open‚Äîshe was suspended inside a massive glass tank, wrists shackled above her head, and the water level was steadily rising.



Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.



The firelight danced on his handsome profile‚Äîbut none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.



‚ÄúLucian‚Ä¶!‚Äù she struggled, water splashing everywhere. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù



‚ÄúYou went to Vanessa,‚Äù he said coldly. ‚ÄúTold her to stay away from me.‚Äù



The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. ‚ÄúSo she deleted all my contacts.‚Äù



‚ÄúThis is your punishment. Remember this lesson.‚Äù



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt!‚Äù Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. ‚ÄúI never even saw her after I went home!‚Äù



‚ÄúStill lying?‚Äù Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. ‚ÄúIncrease the water.‚Äù



The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.



Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.



Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. ‚ÄúI told you‚ÄîI love you. Just give me ten years, and I‚Äôll come back.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut first, stop going after Vanessa.‚Äù



And with that, he turned and left.



‚ÄúLucian! Lucian‚Äî!‚Äù



Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.



The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.



On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes‚Äî



That school trip years ago, when she‚Äôd fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.



The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.



The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached‚Ä¶



But now, it had all gone up in smoke.



By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn‚Äôt even stand.



She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.



Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up‚Äî



Vanessa had updated her social feed.



‚ÄúFirst time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~‚Äù



The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.



Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed‚Äîwhile tears fell onto the screen.



She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.



Lucian didn‚Äôt return until that night.



Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs grab dinner. I‚Äôll make it up to you, okay?‚Äù



He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over now. I‚Äôm just gonna be with her for ten years. Don‚Äôt go looking for trouble again.‚Äù



Celeste looked up, calm. ‚ÄúFine. But you need to sign something.‚Äù



She handed him a document. ‚ÄúA contract promising you‚Äôll come back to the family after ten years.‚Äù



Lucian didn‚Äôt even glance at it before signing.



‚ÄúHappy now?‚Äù He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.



Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù



She was happy.



Because he hadn‚Äôt realized‚Äîwhat he signed wasn‚Äôt a promise to return.



It was a divorce agreement...

# Chapter 2

Just as Lucian Sullivan finished signing his name, his phone rang.



His assistant, Connor‚Äôs voice came through the phone speaker. ‚ÄúMr. Sullivan, Ms. Clarke twisted her ankle. She‚Äôs in a lot of pain and can‚Äôt walk‚Ä¶‚Äù



Lucian‚Äôs expression shifted slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù



He put the phone away and looked at Celeste. ‚ÄúVanessa got hurt. I need to go check on her. Rain check on dinner.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother.‚Äù Celeste clenched the divorce papers in her hand. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to keep me company anymore.‚Äù



Lucian frowned like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned and left.



Celeste headed straight to a law office. The attorney flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs valid. The divorce will be finalized after the mandatory 30-day waiting period..‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù



Leaving the firm, Celeste went back to Ashbourne University. In the Dean‚Äôs office, she handed in her resignation letter.



‚ÄúCeleste?‚Äù Dean Walker looked up in surprise. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of our best instructors. Why are you suddenly quitting?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting divorced,‚Äù Celeste replied calmly. ‚ÄúI want to leave this city.‚Äù



Dean Walker sighed. ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ finish the last few classes this semester, then you can go.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù



Celeste stepped out of the office and took a deep breath.



For her final class, she pulled herself together and walked into the lecture hall‚Äîonly to spot Lucian and Vanessa sitting in the back corner.



Lucian, dressed in a crisp suit, lounged in the last row. Vanessa leaned against his shoulder. The two of them whispered and giggled, fingers entwined.



Celeste felt a sharp pain in her chest.



Lucian used to be a complete workaholic‚Äîhe had cut their honeymoon short after just three days to rush back to the office. And now, he was skipping billion-dollar deals just to sit in on a random elective class with Vanessa?



She took another breath, walked to the front of the class, and began. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre reading Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets‚Ä¶‚Äù



Throughout the entire lecture, laughter kept floating from the back row.



Lucian‚Äôs low chuckles. Vanessa‚Äôs coquettish replies. Each sound stabbed Celeste like a knife.



The second the class ended, she practically bolted out of the classroom.



In the restroom, she splashed cold water on her face. She was just about to leave when she heard Vanessa‚Äôs voice coming from one of the stalls.



‚ÄúLucian gave up a billion-dollar contract just to chase after me‚Äîand even sat through class with me!‚Äù she bragged on the phone. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve seen the way he was looking at me‚Äîlike he wanted to devour me.‚Äù



A girl on the other end asked, ‚ÄúIf he likes you that much, why haven‚Äôt you said yes yet?‚Äù



‚ÄúAre you dumb?‚Äù Vanessa scoffed. ‚ÄúGuys like him? They‚Äôre surrounded by women. The only way to keep them hooked is to string them along‚Äîhot and cold.‚Äù



She lowered her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking to be some kept woman. I want to be Mrs. Sullivan.‚Äù



Celeste stood rooted in place, nails digging into her palm.



Expressionless, she walked out of the restroom and passed right by Vanessa.



‚ÄúProfessor Adams!‚Äù Vanessa scrambled to hang up and rushed after her, grabbing her arm. ‚ÄúWhat did you hear?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù Celeste jerked her hand away. ‚ÄúWhatever it is, it‚Äôs none of my business.‚Äù



Vanessa still wanted to follow up, but out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lucian approaching.



Her eyes flickered, and without warning, she grabbed Celeste‚Äôs wrist and slapped herself‚Äîhard.



Smack!



The sharp crack of a slap echoed harshly down the hallway.



‚ÄúProfessor‚Ä¶‚Äù Vanessa covered her face, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice trembling with grievance. ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôll stay far away from Mr. Sullivan from now on‚Ä¶ Please don‚Äôt be mad at me‚Ä¶‚Äù



Lucian stormed over, his face thunderous. ‚ÄúCeleste! You signed the damn agreement! Why are you still bullying Vanessa?!‚Äù



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Celeste looked at him calmly. ‚ÄúShe slapped herself.‚Äù



‚ÄúMr. Sullivan‚Ä¶‚Äù Vanessa whimpered, shrinking into his arms. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ maybe you should stop pursuing me. Professor Adams is so angry. I‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶‚Äù



Lucian immediately pulled her into his arms. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. She doesn‚Äôt get to decide what I do.‚Äù



Vanessa‚Äôs eyes were red and watery as she whispered, ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs still your wife. She forced me to stay away from you‚Ä¶ and she slapped me‚Ä¶‚Äù



Her voice broke, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been treated like this before‚Ä¶‚Äù



Lucian‚Äôs eyes darkened. He gently touched her cheek where it had turned red, his voice soft.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be upset. I'll let you get back at her tenfold, okay?‚Äù

# Chapter 3

Vanessa feigned panic. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I really shouldn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs your wife. And she‚Äôs my professor‚Ä¶ How could I ever hit my teacher?‚Äù



‚ÄúThen let the bodyguards do it.‚Äù Lucian‚Äôs voice remained gentle‚Äîwhile saying the cruelest words. ‚ÄúThat way you won‚Äôt have to get your hands dirty.‚Äù



Celeste‚Äôs pupils contracted, staring in disbelief at the man who once shielded her from the world. ‚ÄúLucian‚Ä¶ do you even hear yourself right now?‚Äù



Lucian didn‚Äôt even spare her a glance. He raised his hand and gave the order. ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù



Two towering bodyguards stepped forward and slammed her against the wall, pinning her in place.



Smack!



The first slap exploded against her cheek. A sharp ringing filled Celeste‚Äôs ears.



In a daze, she saw a memory from years ago‚Äîa stormy night when Lucian had once stood in front of her like a shield, growling, ‚ÄúTouch her and I‚Äôll make you wish you were dead.‚Äù



Smack!



The second slap shattered the memory. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, staining her pale lips red.



Through the haze, she saw Lucian gently covering Vanessa‚Äôs eyes, whispering softly in her ear.

Vanessa let out a playful little squeal and lightly punched his chest.



‚Ä¶



By the tenth slap, Celeste could no longer feel the pain. Her body gave out, collapsing to the ground as stifled gasps of horror rippled through the students nearby.



Through blurry vision, she saw Lucian say gently to Vanessa, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go get sushi at that place you love.‚Äù



Students in the hallway whispered behind cupped hands, ‚ÄúGod‚Ä¶ poor Professor Adams‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúHow could Mr. Sullivan do that to her?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat girl is disgusting. She slapped herself!‚Äù



Celeste propped herself up against the wall and slowly stood.



Her face throbbed, each step like a blade slicing into her skin.



But what was this pain compared to the gaping wound in her heart‚Äîraw, bleeding, torn open like someone had clawed through it.



She had thought‚Ä¶ even if Lucian no longer loved her, he‚Äôd at least show some shred of compassion for the past they shared.



But he actually had her slapped ten times in front of the crowd, all for Vanessa.



As she stepped out the school gates, the autumn wind stung her bruised face. She gasped in pain.



Back at home, she stood before the mirror and stared at her wretched reflection. Her face was swollen, lips split, blood still dried at the edges.



And suddenly‚Äîshe laughed.



Laughed until fat tears spilled down her cheeks.



It took her three days to heal the wounds on her face before she could go back to school like nothing had happened.



As soon as she stepped into her office, her phone rang. Dean Walker‚Äôs voice came through.

‚ÄúCeleste, Vanessa Clarke skipped several midterm exams. As her academic advisor, you need to follow up with her.‚Äù



Celeste opened Vanessa‚Äôs social feed.



The latest post showed her at an auction, a priceless diamond necklace draped around her neck, with the caption: Mr. Sullivan said this necklace suits me perfectly\~



Scrolling further, it was all pictures of her and Lucian out at lavish venues: private yachts, Michelin-starred restaurants, equestrian clubs‚Ä¶



Celeste dialed Vanessa‚Äôs number.



The background music was loud. Vanessa‚Äôs cheerful voice answered, ‚ÄúHello? Professor?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou missed your midterm exams,‚Äù Celeste said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúDean Walker asked me to check in with you..‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, that,‚Äù Vanessa giggled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a few exams. You‚Äôre close with the Dean‚Äîcan‚Äôt you just enter some grades for me?‚Äù



She paused, then added smugly, ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs too much trouble, I‚Äôll have Mr. Sullivan donate a few buildings. Problem solved, right?‚Äù



Lucian‚Äôs low laughter echoed from the background. ‚ÄúHaving fun?‚Äù



‚ÄúMm-hmm\~‚Äù Vanessa cooed back. Then she added to Celeste, ‚ÄúProfessor, if it‚Äôs nothing urgent, don‚Äôt call again. We‚Äôre busy enjoying ourselves.‚Äù



Click. The call ended.



Celeste gave a bitter laugh and set her phone down. She didn‚Äôt bother following up.



That evening, as she headed home, she spotted Lucian in the front yard of the mansion, personally teaching Vanessa how to drive.



‚ÄúRelax your grip on the wheel. Don‚Äôt be nervous.‚Äù He stood beside the driver's seat, leaning down close to Vanessa, his voice impossibly soft. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid. I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù



The scene pierced through Celeste like a blade.



Once, he had taught her to drive exactly like this.



When she fumbled and nearly hit a guardrail, he had only laughed and pinched her cheek. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs there to be afraid of? I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù



Now he was saying the exact same words to another girl.



‚ÄúTry it on your own,‚Äù Lucian said, stepping back.



Vanessa bit her lip. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll hit someone‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Lucian said, gently ruffling her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù



Reassured, Vanessa pressed the accelerator.



And then‚Äîshe suddenly swerved straight at Celeste.



BAM!



Celeste was thrown into the air and slammed to the ground.



Blood spread beneath her, soaking the pavement.



Through the pain, she saw Lucian rushing toward her.



But the first thing he did was pull the panicked Vanessa into his arms. ‚ÄúAre you okay? Did it scare you?‚Äù



Celeste lay in a pool of blood, her vision darkening.



‚Ä¶



When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake?‚Äù Lucian stood at her bedside, face calm. ‚ÄúThe doctor said you‚Äôve fractured a few ribs. Don‚Äôt go back to work. Just rest.‚Äù



Celeste opened her mouth, but the pain in her chest silenced her. She could only glare at him with bloodshot eyes.



‚ÄúVanessa didn‚Äôt mean to hit you,‚Äù Lucian continued. ‚ÄúShe just started learning. She panicked.‚Äù



‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶ did it... on purpose‚Ä¶‚Äù Through the pain, Celeste forced each word between through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúI was nowhere near her‚Ä¶‚Äù



Lucian‚Äôs brows knit together, his tone turning impatient. ‚ÄúCeleste, what exactly do you want?‚Äù",1,1752733203.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
