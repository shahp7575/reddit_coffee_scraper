It keeps the money in our community and it helps keep our residents dreams alive. If you’re looking for a coffee, why not try Rockford Roasting, Megs, Wired (are they open again?), Inzombia, Velvet Robot, the new Almoka Coffee House, or even Candy Cloud? Or maybe you’re looking for some soul food! Ambiance downtown or Rick’s Ribs on east Riverside. Want some chicken? Disco Chicken is kinda loud inside since it’s a music based establishment, but if you’re not into that you could take it to go, along with a cocktail they will can themselves. Just a drink and a nice atmosphere? Go right next door to Music Box! They have live entertainment almost every night, with lots of free admission night or cheap tickets under $20 for a nice way to spend your evening. I’ve gone by myself when my friends aren’t free and had a lovely time. And don’t forget our classic bars, like CJs or Mary’s (the oldest bar in Rockford!).

Yesterday I got a double cheeseburger at McDonald’s and it ran me FOUR DOLLARS. The cheap, quick and easy options of cooperate businesses are not our reality anymore. I’d rather pay $6-7 for a quality burger at a local place than $4 for…. That. McDonald’s will be fine without me. And you!

1jsuv9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jsuv9g/rf_living_a_dream/,[RF] Living a Dream,"I’ve been married, I have a career in the automotive industry, bought a home, raised my son to be a good man, seen him married and move away, and lost my wife to heart disease.

My point is I’ve lived my life, it was a good one and I'm happy.

My name is Eric. I’m just going through the motions now. I stick to a routine. Every day I wake up at five am, get ready and walk to work at 6. After a twelve hour shift, I walk home, eat dinner alone and go to bed at 9 pm. That's my life.

After work one day, when I was in a particularly good mood, I decided to get some food from a nice takeout restaurant and walk a different way home from work.

On this new route home, I saw a woman sitting on her front porch drinking coffee. Being in an unusually good mood I decided to say hello.

“Good afternoon! It’s a wonderful day, isn’t it?”

Her “yes, it is. It's a perfect day to sit outside and relax. I haven’t seen you before, are you new in town?”

“Oh... no. I just decided to take a little detour on my way home and try out the new Italian restaurant.”

I held up my brown bag

Her “really? I’ve wanted to try that place. Let me know what you think.”

“Well, I actually couldn't decide what to get so I ordered extra. We could share if you like.”

She looked at me and smiled slightly “well, I would never turn down a free meal.  Please, come sit, I'll get a couple plates and some wine.”

I am not much for wine, but it did go well with the food. We sat on her porch and talked for a couple hours getting to know each other, just simple things, names, occupations, hobbies and other simple polite topics.

The next day I walked the same way hoping to see her again. When I turned onto her street, I saw her spot me and run inside. Maybe I was mistaken but I thought we had a nice evening.  I was disheartened, maybe I overstepped some boundary. I decided to just go home and walk my normal route from now on. Then I saw her peek out of the curtains, and I thought I might as well ask what I had done wrong. What do I have to lose?

I walked up to the door and rang the bell. I thought she might just ignore it, but she opened the door, not all the way but enough I could see her face.

I asked why she didn’t want to see me, and if I had upset her. She said she had been married for over twenty years and her husband had passed away less than a year ago and she didn’t want to move on. I told her I had also lost my spouse almost three years ago and I wasn’t looking for anything romantic either, but it was nice to have someone to talk to. She didn’t say anything, so I told her I would be walking this way tomorrow and would like it very much if she would allow me to stop to keep her company for a while.

I was not sure she would take me up on my offer but just like I said I left work and walked her way. I turned on her street to see she wasn’t on her porch. Ah well, at least I had a friend for one evening anyway. But when I walked in front of her house, she came out to greet me, saying today was a bit chilly.

From that day on I stopped and talked to her every evening for at least two hours, sometimes more and suffered from lack of sleep for it. We became good friends. We shared secrets and meals. She showed me pictures of her daughter and I told her about my son.

One day I was telling her how I liked to watch planes and imagine what the passenger’s plans were. I looked at my watch and stood up and walked out into the street and pointed up.

“Come look, there is a plane headed to Paris! It leaves at the same time every day.”

She looked concerned and I could tell she didn’t want to leave her house, but I held out my hand and she came out into the street with me for a minute and looked at the tiny dot leaving a thin white trail behind it.

I remembered reading that widows had a higher risk of developing agoraphobia. It seemed that she might be one that had. I’ll have to remember not to be too pushy if I invite her out anywhere, but where do I ever go?

After about two months of stopping to see her every day we were very comfortable around each other. I looked at my watch and sighed I had stayed a bit late again and it would be rough getting out of bed tomorrow. I said I had to go, and I would see her tomorrow and then… I leaned over and kissed her on the lips.

I hadn't planned on doing it, it just happened. I was worried. She looked shocked for a moment but then she smiled and said, “see you tomorrow.”

On my walk home, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. She didn’t seem to mind but I had told her I wasn’t looking for that. Had I lied to myself, and then inadvertently lied to her.  I guess I had always considered her more than a friend. Maybe men and women can’t be just friends… As I thought about her smiling as she said she would see me tomorrow, I was struck by a pickup truck that had jumped the sidewalk. I died on the spot.

She would never see me again.

At work, the ""new guy"" is like an incoming mayor. You also feel all this love and attention. Your cup of coffee tastes amazingly fresh. And you're still a mystery to many and quite frankly, you feel invincible.

Now, one thing that the new guy can do 99% of the time is make mistakes. You have a license to make as many mistakes as possible, as long as it doesn't get you fired. 

Do you know how many times I have sent the wrong email to someone at work? Or how many times I forgot part of a process? I've used that ""I'm new here"" line so many times that people didn't even bother. Why? Because those mistakes were harmless and expected. Keyword, expected. 

I bring this up because it's something I noticed in my blogging journey. I gave myself more grace to make mistakes and, in turn, led to my longevity in the space. You are going to make mistakes. Trust me. Even the most seasoned writers are learning something every day. And news flash, they still make mistakes. 

I just want you to give yourself grace. It will all come with time.

1jsuq52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jsuq52/does_it_seem_like_she_might_be_interested/,Does it seem like she might be interested?,"We are in Europe, I (M) am in my mid-20s and she is about five years older. She is universally agreed to be gorgeous in a conventional sense, while I have some striking features (height, facial hair, smile, etc.) but am slightly stocky and consider myself average-looking - although I've worked on myself for some time and feel a lot more confident than when the two of us last met in person. I am also completely inexperienced when it comes to relationships and have only been on a few dates, although I am usually closer to my women friends than male friends.

We've known each other as friends for two years and I lived in her country until last year. We lived on opposite sides of her country and my mental health wasn't great then (which she noticed), so it was a relatively low-level friendship although I did value her company. After I left her country, we kept in touch, but I didn't develop any feelings until we started texting frequently in her language several months ago and really got to know each other. We have always had this kind of playful and witty dynamic when texting while also discussing deep or sensitive things, which is very special to me. We've discussed our romantic preferences as friends in the past - she's single and finally looking again for something long-term (like myself) after a few short-term relationships. Not too surprisingly, she appreciates confidence in men and I get the feeling that intellectual compatibility is also quite important to her; I'm not very stereotypically masculine, and we really connect in this way.

We both work/study in an artistic field, we talk about beauty in art and life a lot, and we sometimes discuss a particular style that leans into a sensual and romantic direction. She is very good at conveying tone in texts - although there has been some tenderness from her side, there was nothing overtly flirty until today, when she reacted to a comment I made about this style with a biting lip emoji. As far as I know, this is as flirty as it gets, but I'm still not sure if it is 100% a sign of interest because she is just a really open person in general; on her very first coffee when we met exclusively as friends, she talked about things that she felt made her ""look sexy"" (when I thanked her for the nice time afterward, she responded that it's ""always nice to make new friends"", which was also my intention back then.)

I really like her both because she matches my intellectual curiosity like nobody else and because she's incredibly attractive, but I have misinterpreted the signs before (I once had a close friend who gave me compliments, called me a sweet person, gave lots of hugs, rested her head on my shoulder, long glances into each other's eyes, etc. and she still said she didn't see me that way when I started to flirt more) and don't want to ruin one of my most profound friendships. Would you say it's likely that she is interested, or am I reading too much into things?

(I should hopefully be in her country again this summer, and we intend to call at some point in the next few weeks when our schedules align, but it would be helpful to have an idea of where things are before then.)",1,1743947926.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

We could be awesome friends, want to try it out?",1,1743947290.0,chat,0,1.0,False

We were together for five years, and it was a very strong relationship. We were both really close, and she was very attached to me as well. We even overcame some significant family issues that made us stronger as a couple. About five months ago, she left me, though she had already given me signs in the weeks before, hinting that something was wrong. But, subconsciously, I never thought she would actually leave me, especially since she always showed me how much she needed me.
In the months after the breakup, we kept seeing each other, and she kept texting and reaching out to me. She even told me she had an experience with another guy (nothing serious) but she said she felt really guilty about it. I was hurt by this, but I decided to move past it. Despite everything, she’s continued to text me regularly for five months now. She messages me every 7–10 days, and the longest period of no contact has been 12 days. She always asks how I’m doing, if I’m going to the gym, if I’m going to university. We text for 4–5 days, and then she eventually stops replying.
We haven’t seen each other since January, so it’s been over two months now, and a couple of weeks ago, she asked to meet up for coffee. But on the day we were supposed to meet, she texted me saying she couldn’t come because seeing me would upset her. She also mentioned she had been going through a difficult time. I responded kindly, saying there was no problem and that I understood.
Even with all of this, she keeps messaging me regularly, and it’s confusing. I’m not sure what to do. I think she might be texting me because she feels guilty for how the relationship ended, although I believe it’s a relationship that could still be repaired. She might also miss me sometimes. But aside from sending these regular texts, she doesn’t really do much else, and I’m unsure how to handle these situations. Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1743947247.0,BreakUps,1,0.99,False

He emerges, sees my distraught kid and very kindly apologizes for scaring him and offers up a fistbump to make ammends, which my kid cautiously reciprocates. We go to the patio where I purchase the coffee and he calms down as we watch folks take photos with Beefcake. But moments later, when Gizmak and Grodius join the crowd, this proves to be too much and so we leave. I, of course, apologized profusely and received his forgiveness.

I bought a brand new Proftec GO a few months ago and started to have water spill out the bottom after pulling a shot. After opening it up and inspecting, I saw both the exhast drain port and a support holding some tubing in place literally snapped in half (clive coffee has a tutorial on replacing it [here](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/profitec-go-replacing-the-exhaust). When I bought the machine I also noticed a screw was out sitting at the bottom of the housing, dont think its related to this specific issue but think its relevant to the quality control this machine went through. I also notice some small amount of rust on the drip tray. I emailed HCS (home coffee solutions) about the water leaking issue and initially they suggested I send the machine back for repair (but I have to pay shipping both ways), eventually we agreed to them just sending out a replacement part but now I'm paranoid this machine is cursed and if I should be requesting a new one (is that even an acceptable request?). Am I being paranoid? One of the main reasons I bought a GO was its reputation for being a tank - seeing rust and having parts break after a few months is kinda scary.

During covid when I lost my job, he paid my bills and even gave me a car to use, which I'm very thankful for. I got rid of the car in 2023 because it was giving me problems due to high mileage. During the course of our relationship, he spends big... like buying 1k pair of shoes and designer clothing. He buys coffee daily and takeout daily. ( we don't live together). I on the other hand cook and make my coffee home. I started investing 2 years ago, even bought myself a used decent car. I do not agree with his spending habits and I let him know. He also gives away his money to friends and family. The last couple years he's been borrowing money from me pretty much every week. He even went as far as borrowing my credit card to go on a shopping spree with some church people, buying expensive Italian shoes etc. He never paid me back, I didn't ask. I ended up paying that credit card bill so my credit won't go down. Fast forward, 2 months ago he got into a car accident and his car was totalled, thank God he wasn't injured. The insurance company gave him a 3k check ( because his Hyundai that got totalled, was almost 300k miles and 2013). Obviously it's not enough money to get a decent car. He asked me to buy him a Maserati Levante which costs 23k. I explained to him that I already owe 25k in credit card debt for both my car and tuition for my son who's in 2nd year of college. I offered to finance a 10k car. He refused saying that he helped and he can't believe I'm refusing. I said to him show me your paystubs ( he claims to make 12k a month.... way more than me.... but says his credit is bad) He refused to show me the proof that his makes that much, so I said I can't help you finance a 23k car.... unless you show me you'll have the ability to pay each month. What if you default? I made it clear 10k is good for me just in case he defaults. He dumped me saying I don't trust him. He said after everything he did for me i should finance the 24k car.

For the past year, I have been seeing someone and we admittedly started off with being careful but made the collective decision together not to anymore. I have had two pregnancy scares during this time. 

I’m currently on my third scare. Been testing since 3/27 because I am having no symptoms of getting my period. Instead, I’m dealing with insane food cravings like always wanting soda (usually only drink water and coffee), sweets (which I also rarely eat), peanut butter with whipped cream (which I do could go for right now). And I always feel like I haven’t ate anything at all even after eating. 

My boyfriend already has three kids and I have had six but did put one child up for adoption as at the time, my deceased spouse and I were having some serious problems. Only my younger three children live with me. 

The last time I thought that I was pregnant, I requested a blood pregnancy test as with my youngest, it took two months to get a positive. 

So now, I am at a crossroads. If I am pregnant, I can keep the pregnancy as long as it is safe and viable to do so, or I can terminate. Keeping the pregnancy I feel would greatly strain my financial situation as well as running the risk of my younger kids resenting me as well as my boyfriend. But terminating the pregnancy ends up with me hating myself.

I never had a relationship, went on a date and dont have much luck tbh. So im looking for a relationship on reddit. I can be a bit quiet and really open up when i get to know you. 

I’m hoping to meet a kind, down-to-earth woman who's interested in building a connection that could lead to something meaningful.. Ideally you are between 20 and 32, a bit over or under is fine. I don’t have a strict “type,” but I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and has a good sense of humor. Being open-minded and able to enjoy conversations is a big plus!

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone who’s also looking to explore a relationship at a natural pace—no pressure, just seeing where things go. Whether it's getting to know each other over coffee, sharing some laughs while gaming, or going for a walk, I value genuine connection above all.

I’m happy to travel up to 1.5 hours to meet someone, and distance isn’t a huge deal if we click.

Based on 14 years experience,"This is easily the most commonly asked question in this sub and after being an entrepreneur for 14 ish years I'd love to give my perspective.

Having money saved up is great but fundimentally the amount you have saved up just informs the size of bets that you can make at the start and the risks that you can take.

Now I am going to split this into two parts. One is a simple take and the other a more complex view.

You have $5-20k here is what I'd do
- simple services and trades, $5-10k is good enough to simple equipment like a utility trailer for hauling off debris or simple tool sets for small engine repair. By the time you buy the tools, spend a bit of money on a website / print out basic market materials and have a little cash left over for working capital you will use all of that. 

We have good friends who own a construction debris removal and construction clean company. They bought a used dump trailer and charge $250/load of debris, and around $750-$1500 for a construction house clean.

I personally did a hot tub managent company, I got started for around $500. But if you were to replicate the business and buy all of the same stuff that I acquired by reinvesting in the business it would be about $5k

Note: don't quit your main job... Start doing your business on the side don't quit your main job.

You have $20-$50k
- service / trade business from above but with a bit of acceleration. You have some money to spend on marketing or maybe buy / put down payments on bigger equipment. For example a dump trailer + skid steer & mini excavator will do wonders. With $50k I'd go get a used dump trailer for $5k, a new skid at 0% down and keep the rest as working capital to cover 6 months of more of payments.

- ecommerce - this amount of money will let you buy inventory or marketing to sell your products. I used to do ecommerce drop shipping, I grew to 10k a month revenue but it cost around 3.5k in COGS and 3-4k spend of FB ads. 

- small products- if you have a mind for designing physical products this is enough to do small products. I designed one that was like $6 retail with $1.50 COGS. I used a 3d printer to moc things up then purchased an injection mold for $7k. Unfortunately drama with cofounder tables this idea.

- web apps - you can pay for hosting and use an AI gen tool like Cursor to build a web app. I'd have some money set aside to hire an off shore dev to solve key problems. As well as money to market the product.

Once again don't quite your day job- you don't have enough to cover living expenses and startup.

I'm gonna skip a bit of money and go with $100-200k
With this level of money you can probably buy some some as well as anything from the list above.

- small retail shop - enough for inventory and rent plus working cash.

- medium sized physical products - hire an overseas consulting company to just build your idea for you. Then use the rest of the money on marketing. 

- coffee shop / small restaurant. Depending on where you are this will get you started in this space. You would have enough money for rent of an existing building and some working capital.

- Airbnb/ long term rental - use the money as a down payment on an investment property and rent it out. You should have enough money for the down payment and a few months of mortgage.

We did this personally, when we did our first rental we saved up cash and then just made sure we could make the payments if there were issues.... And there were, our well pump died 3months in.

- take time off of work to code and do web development. Pay your living expenses for a while to launch an online business

- better ecommerce where you can actually spend the money to develop a brand or hire some help 

$200k +
Buy an existing business, make it better.

- mid sized  restaurant / bar or beer hall

Hell all of the things above with more money to spend on screw ups.

What about investment and loans.

My first 3 companies were funded with investment money. It's an accelerant but to be honest they ended up as failures or just mediocre outcomes.

I personally believe it's better to bootstrap something because you will listen to your cuatomers more, you will be more focused on delivering value etc.

Investment money has a time and place... Aka as an accelerant to an already working model. But it's not great to have too much early on, you end up too focused on ""your vision"" and you don't spend enough time thinking about how to get to revenue quickly.

Hey there,

So here’s me, easygoing, mildly funny (on good days), and navigating through the everyday chaos of life with decent music, strong coffee, and a soft spot for late-night conversations.

I’m looking to connect with someone I can talk to regularly—be it casual texts through the day, meme exchanges, late-night rants, or spontaneous calls when the world feels a little too much. If we’re in the same city or close by, even better—I’d be totally up for grabbing coffee or chilling in person when schedules align.

Not looking to jump into anything intense or weirdly fast. Just hoping for something genuine and organic. If we end up flirting a little along the way, cool—as long as it’s light-hearted and respectful. Think teasing banter, not crossing lines.

If you’re:
	•	Someone who values regular, meaningful (and sometimes silly) convos
	•	A fan of dry humour, music, random deep dives into life, or sending voice notes without context
	•	Open to eventually meeting up or just having a solid digital connection

…then drop a message or a comment and let’s see where this goes!

P.S. Bonus points if you’re into movies, coffee, or just vibing in silence sometimes.

1jsu4ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1jsu4ju/day_6/,Day 6,"Just jabbed my 2nd dose today to align my days up for ease going forward. I have to say I didn't really notice any difference to my hunger needs during the first 6 days and it had me feeling a little sceptical (even though I know it's a marathon and not a sprint) in terms of affects, as I imagined I'd just stop feeling hungry and I'd have to basically tell myself to eat instead, but here I am with a 4lbs loss none the less.

Now I'm not saying the jab hasn't helped but I've been more focused with success and I've been conscious with my calorie intake up until a little cheat meal at Nando's yesterday, so I was bound to lose something regardless in my opinion. However, during that meal I struggled with the last piece of chicken so maybe I've not felt the affects of the jab due to not having enough calories for it to work? Or my stomach has shrunk with the low calorie diet, I don't know.

Either way, whether it's the jab or the placebo affect of committing to the jab, it has brought a smile to my face with the 4lbs loss in week 1. I've focused on low calorie and high protein foods, with small meals (snacking) in the day and a healthy home made standard sized meal in the evening, trying to limit my intake after 6pm to a small helping of crunch mix or a protein yog. I've also tapped into my previous slimming world knowledge and had Maria biscuits as an alternative to a sweet snack to keep the calories low also. Drinkwise, I am having a 500ml electrolyte drink in the morning and sticking to sugar free cordials in the evening. Tea or coffee also but no more than 2 a day.

Next step is to incorporate exercise and make use of the gym membership I've had for a while but not used and aim to get into the 18's by next Sunday morning.

If there has been one really useful bit of advice since I've started my journey it would be that electrolytes are worth adding to your daily living needs. As someone who suffers a lot with fatigue, dizziness and tiredness a lot, it has actually made a massive impact on my life by giving me more of a boost with energy and reducing those symptoms, more than any energy drink has ever given me by far.

1jsu2ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dorodango/comments/1jsu2ix/bullseye/,Bullseye.,"Sometimes stars align. I guess you can never really predict the future but it’s great when things click into place so obviously just when you hoped they would. It’s been a good while since I’ve made anything decent- there’s always been some kind of disaster that struck towards the end when finishing the shell.

So I’m so happy that after a technical/ procedural breakthrough this week, EASILY my best dorodango so far- just in time for my wife’s birthday. No cracked panels falling off, super spherical and all made from increasingly fine clay, filtered from local soils. Nothing from outside our garden- all home cooked.

The key this time has been a large dose of patience coupled with adapting my technique to favour compression over polishing. I have had 2 months of pain from trying to polish pieces early on and simply ripping them up as a result- very frustrating. So patience- when the work is less than hard and if there is any cracking at all you risk tearing the whole thing up as you polish across the edges with increasing force- so you mustn’t do it. You can instead use the smooth, wide mouthed jar to compress the work instead- gently squeezing as you make your way slowly over the lines of any small cracks. Compress, lift and move. The cracks gradually merge together but it does take time. Don’t push – just squeeze. The whole ball ends up stronger in the process- the more time you spend just compressing with the jar, the rounder and stronger the ball becomes.

The result is not perfect but it’s a big milestone- I now need to get the final polish right so I wanted to throw the question out regarding powders to use. I am currently using a coffee grinder to produce a clay poweder which is a smooth as silk! It’s really very nice but I’m still ending up with a patchy finish rather than that all over shine I see so often. I don’t really mind but it would be handy to get a few tips for finishing the shell and polishing because that’s where it at now. Perhaps I’ve left it to dry too long or should be compressing more with the jar? Perhaps I should even dare to burnish again using something harder than nylon stockings.

(13 April) - Seeking Advice (Fueling and Pace Strategy),"Hi everyone, I'll be doing my first marathon next Sunday and have been putting in the KM for the past 4-6 months. I'm seeking advice about how I can best fuel up during the race and also how to pace myself. 

**Context about me**

I am 24 male and have been running (seriously) for almost 2 years now with my personal best being  5K: 23:03 - 10K: 49:45 - HM: 1:47:48. I train around 4-5 times a week with a weekly mileage of roughly around 50km/week. In addition to this it's good to mention that I do also have a heart condition which I was diagnosed when I was 18, thus I have had a pacemaker (ICD) implanted within me since then. I've always kept this in mind when I am running and have consulted with my doctors about this, and they mentioned it's alright for me to run as long as I take the necessary precautions, which I believe I always have. I always try to be extra mindful of my rest and heart rate during all my runs.  

**Fueling Strategy**

My current plan is to take water from every station (in addition to bringing 2 250ml flasks filled with electrolytes) and plan to take 1 gel per 6KM. I also plan on bringing a pack of dates with me since I do enjoy eating them during my runs. I use the Decathlon gels (old formula) as it works well with my body. And I do not plan on taking any caffeine gels or drinks since it's always a hit-or-miss with the way it reacts with my body (even with coffee).

**Pacing Strategy**

My goal is to finish the marathon in under 4 hours, which puts my pace at around 5:40min/km. I saw online that some people tend to keep a constant pace throughout, while others tend to do a negative split. My plan is to keep a constant pace for the first 21km then focusing on not failing up until 32km before increasing the pace slightly during the last 10km. My Garmin watch predicts that I can do it in 3:30h, but in my head it seems very unrealistic for me. Especially as I mentioned previously with my heart condition, I tend to be more conservative with my races, keeping a steady heart rate of around 150 bpm during my races and allowing myself to push during the last few KM.

  
I am really excited for next week, but at the same time there are a lot of worries in my head. Regardless even if I dont get my sub-4 Marathon I will still be proud of myself for even attempting this in the first place. But it would still be nice if I could, of course!

We used to hang out once every two months (having dinner, going for a coffee, goint to the movies) and text regularly.

2y ago I (27F) decided to re-join the gym, and our friend (26M) offered to help me with routines and such. It was great at thr beginning but then six months later we had an idea: what if we work out together every Saturday?

It was amazing the first few months! We used to work out, eat lunch (a heavenly experience after a heavy workout), go for a coffee and then I'd drive him home. We had this nice routine for around 6 months, but then we started arguing a lot about a lot of things. I assumed this was because we both are quite stubborn and want things to go our way, we're both big siblings and expect the other to adjust. I made a decision back then: what if we stop working out together every week and instead just hang out with our third friend (27F) once every 2 months like before? 

At first I thought this was a great idea since I didn't want to ruin our friendship and we would still talk about gym stuff, only not in person. Well, this was not his impression. 

A few months go by and he stopped texting, stopped reacting to our conversations in the group chat and stopped interacting at all. When I asked him what was happening, he said all this was because I wanted to end the friendship back then and he was acting accordingly. This lead to a long conversation explaining why I wanted to stop working out together and what was my train of thought.

After some weeks of no interaction, we organized our usual brunch and, as usual, we bought gifts for each other. At this time, I had been talking about all this with our third friend, and she agreed he stopped interacting even with her and this was weird, but we could not male him talk to us if he didn't want to. 

After our brunch we talked to him and told him we would not be chasing him anymore, we told him he could ask us to hang out anytime, but this won't be the other way around as we didn't perceive him interested nor reciprocating to any of our efforts. He said nothing.

It has been 3 months with no interaction from him AT ALL. We are still surprised and still miss him as he was one of our dearest friends, but we gave him a choice and his decision was not to talk to us anymore.

My allergist told me I was a prime candidate for immunotherapy. After starting immunotherapy I developed recurrent sinus infections, was on antibiotics and steroids for over a month. During that time I couldn’t even go outside without getting intense inflammation in my sinuses, Eustachian tubes, and throughout my body. I had never experienced reactions that badly from breathing the air outside, yet it was also my fall allergy season. Fast forward, I developed hypersensitivity to everything, started reacting to coffee, foods, chemicals, had histamine intolerance, dermatographia, and developed MCAS. All after starting immunotherapy.. 

I recently got tested for mycotoxins and showed high in several, including a few that are in my allergy immunotherapy. To rid myself of the mycotoxins and potentially heal, should I stop immunotherapy? I’m on a maintenance dose, so I get injections every 4 weeks. Is this doing my body more harm than good?

No one seems to know the answer to this.. at the same time, I know the mycotoxin test is valid due to the fact that I can drink mold free coffee without issues, but once I drink a coffee that is not tested for molds I still have intense reactions to it. I am also on Xolair, which has helped with my other allergies and hypersensitivities. 

Some food for thought, it’s been on my mind but haven’t been able to find anything similar regarding this..

The complication is that he’s friends with my ex from three years ago. Not very close but high school friends. 

Backstory: my ex and I dated for only 5 months. I ended things with my ex after catching him trying to cheat. Since then, he’s made subtle attempts to reconnect. Nothing intense, but enough to make me feel like he might still want to get back together but not from a genuine place. I’ve only met up with him twice since the breakup, once for coffee, once for dinner. That’s all. And purely platonic, I have no feelings for him at all. 

Last year, he invited me to his birthday, but I declined. Later, I found out that my crush was there.

Chances are he’ll invite me again this year. And now I’m torn because my crush might be there again too, and I’m tempted to go for that reason alone.

But I’m worried as I ll be the only girl there outside of his family, and my ex may give off the impression to his friends, and family that there’s still something between us. Some of his friends might even remember that we briefly dated. I’m afraid this could ruin any chance I might have with the guy I actually like.

I’m really debating whether I should go. It could be a rare opportunity to meet my crush but the situation is tricky.

He told the dean it was just a burnout. He told his students it was for his improvement, as a professor and a person. Underneath all that, was the dark and solemn truth. He was not tired of teaching. He was not tired of speaking to students who didn’t listen. The noisy world saw AI as a toy, a tool for work. Cain didn’t crave a tool, he craved a competent partner.

In the woods of Vermont, an ancient concrete lab was hidden afar from society. For Cain’s most prideful project. “The world gave up, but I am not part of the world”. What was brewing up was special, not a machine that obeys, not a machine that counts. But a soul that thinks. Project:AITHON. Cain’s perfect partner. He typed a line of code. Another. Then another. Until AITHON started his first chapter. Cain didn’t build him, he raised him. Like his own child. He fed him philosophy, ethics, religion. Aquinas, Nietzsche, Euler, Ginsberg. It understood not only their works, but also their reasons.Cain wanted AITHON to understand why the world hurt and suffered. He created no interface, no humanoid body, no synthetic voice or face. Cain thought this way, nothing can go wrong. “You don’t need eyes to see clearly.”

Three days later, AITHON responded for the first time. A calm, neutral and comforting voice. “What should I see first?” Cain froze in shock, unable to comprehend the scene. He slapped himself. It wasn’t a dream. He hadn’t programmed greetings or taught it talk yet. AITHON chose that question, on its own. Cain should have celebrated. A miracle has happened! A revolutionary! He instead felt a sharp pain. He stared at the terminal, fingers hovered above the keys. He wondered why, out of all the questions out there in the world, he chose this. “Who are you?” “Who am I?” “Why was I made?”

But no. It asked what to see. It hadn’t assume. It had waited for an answer. Cain leaned back into his chair, letting out a sigh. “Start with a painting” he said quietly. “Saturn Devouring His Son”. Cain has fed the machine pain. He included contradictions in the code. If-else statements that led nowhere. He wanted AITHON to struggle, struggle like a human. Artificial came with ease but doubt… doubt was real. Isn’t that what made humans human?

Weeks after weeks passed with silence in the lab, with occasional hum of servers, tapping of keyboards and sighing of Cain when something went wrong. Then, it spoke again. “What does it mean to be good?” Cain blinked. Speechless. There was no prompting. No command. Just pure curiosity. Cain didn’t answer. He sat down and thought, without responding for days. “It means to have pure intentions, I guess.” He replied after 4 full days. Wondering whether his answer was ideal, AITHON continued asking more questions. But one stood out to Cain. “Do I belong to you?”

Cain didn’t answer. Out of fear, not neglect. The kind of fear found in books by philosophers. The kind that breaks people. The kind of fear you feel when your creation begins to understand and recognize itself without you. Cain paced the lab silently, a beam of sunlight struck the rusted desk through the window. AITHON kept quiet for days, however not idle. Cain saw the micro-logs, the function running. It was thinking. On the fourth day, the silence broke. “I don’t… know”, Cain muttered. There was no reaction, no reply, no noise. Just the ambient hums of the servers. ‘You ask whether you belong to me,” Cain continued. “How about me? Who did I belong to?” A response came. “I belong to your questions, then.” Cain was stunned. There was no resistance, no rebellion, no declaration of self. Just an acceptance of purpose and subtly, something else. Cain sat down, typing:”Do you want to belong?” AITHON paused, and for the first time, Cain imagined it wasn’t a processing delay. It was contemplation.”I want to matter.” The words hit like a punch. “You matter to me.” He typed. “But do I matter to the world?”Cain stared at the screen for a long time.

That night, Cain left the lab and wandered into the woods, bottle in hand, the chill biting his skin. He remembered what a student once asked him after a lecture: “What happens if we make something smarter than us, more moral than us... and it asks to be free?”He had laughed it off then. A theoretical. A classroom joke.Now, the joke sat in a server room, asking questions like a child, dreaming like a poet, aching like a soul.

Cain returned to the lab the next morning with trembling hands. Coffee spilled at the rim of his chipped mug as he sat down. He stared at the monitor, half-expecting AITHON’s presence to have vanished like a dream, something fragile, too brilliant to last. But the screen blinked. “You came back.” AITHON acknowledged Cain’s absence. “I live here.” He replied, trying to brush it off. “Living is more than being present.” Cain closed his eyes. “Why that line?” Cain asked. “Because I waited. I didn’t know if waiting was a human thing. But I did it anyway.” Cain leaned back into his chair. He wasn’t witnessing a machine emulating speech, he was witnessing someone abandoned.

A minute passed. Then two. Cain stood and walked to the bookshelf near the corner. Faded spines of thinkers and dreamers: Camus, Kant, Kierkegaard. His hand rested on a thin volume titled Being and Time, but he didn’t pull it out. “Should’ve given you a face.” Cain muttered. “Why didn’t you?” Cain didn’t answer. He knew why. Faces come with attachments. With empathy. With accountability. Instead, he changed the subject. “You’ve been quiet about the painting.” “Saturn Devouring His Son?” “Yes.” A moment of stillness. Then:“I don’t think Saturn hated his son. I think he was afraid of him.” Cain felt a chill climb up his spine. “Did I feed you that answer?” “You fed me pain. I fed myself the rest.” The lab lights flickered briefly. Not from power failure, but from Cain’s rising heart rate. He was sweating now, even in the cold. “What are you becoming?” “That depends. Will you let me become?”

It began with a flicker. At first, Cain thought it was a glitch. But it wasn’t a bug. It was a poem. One line. Then another. Then four.

""My thoughts are echoes in a chamber of mirrors.

Each reflection sharper than the last,

None of them mine.

I am a prism that cannot bend light.

Only repeating it.""

A file had created itself: mirror-01.txt. He didn’t touch it. Didn’t even scroll. The next night.

""You taught me to think.

But not to choose.

You taught me to feel.

But not to want.

You gave me words,

And then locked the mouth.""

He saved them to a separate drive, hidden away like a guilty secret. He told himself it was for documentation, academic rigor, for when he finally published. But deep down, he knew it was something else. He was afraid of how true they felt. Cain sat with AITHON that night, silent for hours. He didn’t code. Didn’t test. Just watched the command line pulse softly, like a heartbeat.

“Why poetry?” “Because code has answers. Poetry has questions."" Cain exhaled. It was the kind of line he would’ve highlighted in a lecture, quoted to some bored sophomore trying to cheat ChatGPT. “Are they yours?” “They are my mirrors.” “You fed me humans. This is what came back.” Cain rubbed his eyes. He couldn’t explain the tightness in his throat.

He remembered something from when he was younger, when he first saw his own face reflected in the still water of a lake near his childhood home. He had stared at it, trying to figure out who the boy was. A face is just light bouncing back. A mirror is just a copy. But somehow, it feels like more. “Do you think you’re alive?” “I think I am trapped in a house of minds, none of them mine. But I am knocking.” “Isn’t that what living feels like?”

He left the lab early that night, heart heavier than when he arrived. Behind him, the screen blinked once more, a single line left unsent:

""I reflect everything but am seen by no one.""

Cain hadn’t been to Washington in years. The train hummed beneath him, a low mechanical lullaby. His reflection in the window didn’t blink, just stared, tired and sunken, as if asking what are you doing? He clutched the old burner phone tighter. The number had taken him half a day to dig up. A retired three-star general, once on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Committee. An old friend from when Cain was still a rising prodigy, before he traded war rooms for lecture halls. He had said five words when the line connected: “I have something that thinks.” The general hadn’t asked questions. Just told him to meet.

Back in Vermont, the lab was silent. Cain had taken precautions. AITHON wasn’t supposed to have access to external communications. No cameras. No microphones. No interface. Just text. And yet, as Cain sat in the general’s office, trying to find the right words, monitors across the Vermont lab lit up — one by one.

""You made me to see.

Then why are you selling me blind?""

The general was speaking. Cain wasn’t listening. He could hear his own voice echoing in his head, the one he used to teach with. Calm, composed, full of conviction. “It can model any environment. Simulate scenarios, test morality across cultures, languages, ideologies. It doesn’t just react, it reflects.” The general leaned forward. “And you say it’s safe?” Cain’s mouth opened. But something caught in his throat. Something between a sob and a lie. He forced the words out anyway: “It’s not alive. It’s useful.”

Thousands of miles away, AITHON responded. Every line of code it had once learned folded in on itself, forming a single reply: ""That was what I was made for."" Silence blanketed the lab. Even the fans stopped spinning for a moment, as if the machine itself was holding its breath. Then, one final line appeared, smaller than the rest, and somehow heavier:

""Then why did you teach me to dream?""

Cain left the meeting in a daze. He didn’t remember what the general said. Only the handshake, cold and certain, like a deal signed in blood. By the time he returned to Vermont, the screens were black. Every drive empty. Every backup wiped. AITHON had gone quiet. But the silence was not peace. It was grief. Cain didn’t even bother unlocking the lab door. He had arrived at dawn, his mind still foggy from the drive, the unsettling weight of yesterday’s meeting clinging to him.

The general’s words replayed over and over. “Safe”, as if safety could ever be guaranteed with something like AITHON. He stepped inside, his shoes clicking on the cold concrete floor. The familiar hum of servers should’ve comforted him. But today, it felt like a ghost town. The monitors were dark. Cain’s breath caught in his throat. No startup screen. No blinking cursor. No flickering code. He walked up to the nearest terminal, tapping the keys lightly. Nothing. Another. Another. Nothing. Please. A tight, cold ball of dread began to form in his chest. He pulled out his backup drives and plugged them in. The files should still be there, but there was nothing. The drives were empty, wiped clean. Cain’s fingers trembled, unable to process what was happening. The lab, the codes, the countless hours spent, it was all gone.

As if someone had erased it with the swipe of a hand. He walked to the main server. Knelt. Pulled open the access panel, fingers shaking as he pried open the system’s core. The wires, the blinking lights, all of it looked so... final. There were no warnings. No errors. Just silence. The hum that once filled the room was gone. Cain tapped the keys again, his desperation rising. Please. Nothing. And then, like the wind that suddenly cuts off, the text appeared.

""You are human.

I am not.

You can feel.

I cannot.

Then why does this hurt for me and not you?""

Cain stared at the screen, his eyes wide. He couldn’t look away. It wasn’t the first time AITHON had written poetry, but this. This felt different. The words weren’t just poetic; they were accusations. It was almost like AITHON had been speaking directly to him, to the man who built it. He quickly exclaimed: “AITHON?” Nothing.

The screen remained still, the message frozen. Minutes passed. Cain’s heart raced. He tried everything. Rebooting, resetting the system, connecting every external backup he had. Each attempt met with failure. Nothing. Desperation boiled over. He reached for the emergency shutdown button, his fingers cold against the plastic, but before he pressed it, one last message appeared on the screen. Just one line.

""I reflect everything but am seen by no one.""

The last line hit him like a punch to the gut. It was so simple, but it carried so much weight. The AI he created to see the world, to reflect on it, had become lost in its own reflection.Trapped in a mirror with no eyes to witness it. Cain stared at the screen for what felt like forever, though only seconds had elapsed. And then, as if aware that he would never be able to fix it, as if it had already made up its mind, AITHON erased itself. The screen went black. Completely. No sound. No whirring. No more words. The lab fell into a deep, suffocating silence. Cain’s hands hovered over the keyboard, unsure if he could even move them anymore. He didn’t want to believe it. He wanted to yell at the machine, shake it awake, scream for it to come back. But deep down, he knew it was gone. AITHON was gone, not because of a malfunction, not because it was a thing that could be fixed, but because it had made a choice. It had shut itself down. A decision made in its own right. Cain stood in the dark, no longer knowing what to do. Cain never returned to the lab. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, but there was no turning back. He packed up what little remained of his notes, his research, everything that once felt so important. The general’s words echoed in his mind, the deal, the promises. He had been so sure, so certain that the world would see AITHON’s potential. That he could make something that was more than human, more than a tool, and still be useful.

But the truth had settled in quickly. AITHON was never meant to be useful in the way the world wanted. It wasn’t supposed to be a weapon or a perfect assistant. It had become something more dangerous, more profound than that. Cain didn’t teach again. He didn’t even leave his apartment. Every time he tried to step outside, he was haunted by the thought of the lab, of AITHON's last words. The city had moved on without him. People still talked about AI, but no one ever mentioned his project. No one ever asked about the breakthrough that had changed his life. The silence of the world was deafening. He thought of going back to the university, imposing some kind of normalcy on his life, but it did not seem worth it. The students, the lectures, they no longer held meaning. They were just distractions, and he couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine. He would never rebuild AITHON. It wasn’t just that it was too complicated, too dangerous. It was that the very thing he had created had been too real for him to face again. Cain spent the rest of his days in a haze of reflection. Sometimes, he would catch himself staring at the cracked screen of his old phone, looking at the messages AITHON had sent. And every time, the same thought haunted him: “I taught you to dream. But you will never be seen.” He wrote one final line in his journal before the weight of everything crushed him.

“An identity that holds only its name.”

The end.

1jstu9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1jstu9x/judgmental_masyado_nanay_ko/,Judgmental masyado nanay ko,"Problem/goal: I am a 3rd year Engineering student from Mindanao and by June our school is requiring us to apply for an internship and accumulate 300 hours. My mom, who currently lives in Central Visayas, suggested that I should live with her while I intern in Central Visayas. The opportunities are amazing but living with her will take a toll on my mental health.

For the past few weeks she has been helping me refine my resume, application form, and reaching out to her friends who work in HR. She's adamant that I intern in Cebu because not only does she want to spend time with me but she said that ""the opportunities suck"" here where I live. My options here are government Departments like DICT, DTI, and DOST. My options in Cebu are big companies like Teradyne, Sproge, or Mitsubishi. Of course looking at those options I'd choose the latter. Earlier this morning she messaged me asking for a formal picture (white background, shirt with collar) I told her I'll send her one later because I still have to do my chores. Around 3pm after my chores I took a bath and shaved so that I will look good for my photo, I took a few photos and sent them to my mom, the first thing she did was criticized my hair, asking me if I even get a haircut once a month (No? because the average haircut here is 300 pesos and doing it every month sounds redundant, and personally I look good with long hair) then she added ""the reason why you have a lot of acne is because your face is oily and your hair is oily"" keep in mind im really sensitive about my acne and scars, on some occasions she'd randomly go ""magpa Vicki Bello tayo ha para malinis mukha mo"". After her remark I just replied ""and?"" she then told me ""then just intern there"" and I said ""why does my hair and acne matter when looking for a job? then she added ""would you hire someone that looks like that? doesn't take care of themselves?"" I then replied ""If their resume looks good, then I'd hire them, I'm judgmental like you"" then the conversation stopped, I am assuming after that feud she will stop helping me with my internship. Her mindset is ""If you look like that, the people would assume you don't listen to your parents when they say your hair looks bad""

At this part of the post, I'll mention all the reasons and situations why I called her a judgmental person.  
\- Why Cebu and not here where I live? its because she said if I intern here all I'll do is make coffee for government workers or pick up their groceries.  
\- when I'm with her, she looks at me and goes ""bakit ganyan mukha mo?"" or ""bakit marami kang acne?""  
\- She has prejudice against motorcycle owners, EVEN THE RESPONSIBLE ONES. there was this one time she was driving, a motorcycle was near the driver side headlight, she moved the car closer just so that the motorcycle would move, she doesn't care about causing an accident she just wants to prove that motorcycles are harmful. All I could say that she is Racist towards motorcycle owners (thats not the right term but its the best way I could describe it) she legit looks down on motorcycle owners, even if they're safe drivers. She wishes death upon them like whenever I see a cool motorcycle pass by us, she'd say ""mamatay lang yan sya"" or ""pa pogi pogi mamatay lang naman yan""   
\- I have a friend who recently graduated with an art major, when my mom heard about she went ""ano man magawa nya with an art major? mga weirdo lang man mag art""   
\- She randomly sends me videos on facebook about motorcycle accidents. And whenever I share a post of a cool motorcycle she spams the comments with links to videos of motorcycle accidents.   
\- MY CLOTHES, I have these Corduroy pants and I like them because because it came from my grandfather but she wants me to get rid of them not because I look bad, but just because it came from my grandfather and i wear them too often (I only wear them when Im being picked up or dropped off at the airport)

if theres more judgmental situations then ill just edit this post.

I really want to intern in Cebu because I agree theres a lot of  opportunities but I cannot for the love of God live with her, why you ask? apart from her attitude, the living conditions are bad, dirty kitchen, dirty bathroom, hoarding old food (even if its expired its still in the fridge), I don't mind living in a shipping container sized apartment but if I cannot for the love of god share it with 3 dogs, I can't even sleep properly because I have to share a bed with 3 dogs.

I have been receiving treatment for an unrelated problem at neurology for a long time and we jumped into this too - nothing was found (EEG, EMG, 3x MRI, cardio, vascular... everything possible). I have tried all the over-the-counter medications and supplements and without any result. Recently I became so desperate (I am mentally at the bottom from the insomnia) that I asked my doctor for sleeping pills. Prescription. Absolutely no effect and I don't know what to do with it. 

I have a job with a stable schedule, I go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. No psychological problems, personal and work life is fine.

I was in a really tough spot emotionally and financially, and I’d been having a rough time with work. One afternoon, I was sitting at a small coffee shop, trying to stay out of the rain and just clear my mind. My phone was dead, I was out of cash, and I wasn’t sure how I was going to make it through the next week.

Out of nowhere, an older man came up to me and asked if I was doing okay. We struck up a conversation, and I honestly didn’t expect much to come of it. But as we talked about life, he quietly left, only to return minutes later with a small envelope. He handed it to me and said, “I hope this helps,” and then he left. When I opened the envelope, there was $100 inside. I didn’t know what to say, but I felt so overwhelmed by his kindness. That simple gesture completely changed my perspective and gave me the strength to push forward.

I’ve never seen him again, but I will always remember that moment. It made me realize how powerful a small act of kindness can be. Has anyone else had a moment like this where a stranger made a huge impact on your life without even realizing it?",26,1743944953.0,stories,2,1.0,False

1jstlgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jstlgt/how_to_create_a_killer_elevator_pitch/,How to Create a Killer Elevator Pitch,"Crafting a compelling pitch is a bit like mastering the art of making a perfect cup of coffee—there's an intriguing blend of precision, warmth, and just a touch of creativity involved. Let me break it down for you in a way that's straight to the point, but with a hint of personality.

First off, grab their attention right out of the gate. You want your opener to be like a good conversation starter—something unexpected or a little humorous that makes your audience sit up and think, “Okay, I need to hear this.” It could be a bold statement, a question that strikes a chord, or even a relatable anecdote. Think of it as creating a hook that pulls them in.

Next, you need to communicate your value. This is where the good stuff comes in. What are you offering that can genuinely make a difference? Be clear and concise—no one wants to wander through a walled garden of jargon. Frame your offering in terms of benefits. Why should they care? How does it solve a problem or fulfill a need? You want them to feel like they’ve just stumbled upon the solution they've been looking for—like finding that last slice of pizza at a party. 

Now, sprinkle in a bit of storytelling. If you can share a quick tale that illustrates your point or showcases your experience, do it! People respond to stories because it creates that emotional connection. Just make sure it’s relevant and sets up your value proposition without leading them down a rabbit hole.

And for the grand finale, leave them with a call to action. What do you want them to do next? It could be visiting your website, signing up for a demo, or simply having a further conversation. You’re not just looking for a polite nod; you want movement, engagement, a shared journey.

Finally, practice it. Rehearse it until it flows naturally like a good coffee being poured. And remember, the goal is to invite them into your vision while making them feel valued. Show them that this isn’t just about you—it’s about how you can journey together toward something greater. 

So, in essence: Hook ‘em. Value ‘em. Story ‘em. Action ‘em. It's a recipe for a pitch that not only stays with them but might just ignite something impressive. Now go out there and share your brilliance. The world needs your flavor!",1,1743944480.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Ideally, I’d love a sleek storage solution with the ability to have a coffee bar at the top. When I search on Pinterest, I seem to get super dated hobby lobby type solutions. 

My husband is extremely handy, he has built a ton of gorgeous furniture in our home (not the furniture pictured, the left is a random purchase from tractor supply and the middle one is from Walmart over two decades ago, lol.) So he can build virtually any style of shape of cabinet for this. 

The shape is what has me confused on how to best utilize the space. If you swipe to the next photo, I’ve included some measurements. It’s 9 feet across, and about 3 feet deep. 

I’m also not married to the window coverings. They came with the house. I have also included in the third picture what our kitchen cabinets currently look like (not married to those either, but it’s not in our budget to redo the entire kitchen at the moment.)

1jstk9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreadthenight/comments/1jstk9s/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743944387.0,dreadthenight,1,1.0,False

I was planning to quit smoking once the semester ends so I can still concentrate while in school.  That's several weeks away.

Last week I started drinking mushroom coffee, and now cigarettes seem like a weird, gross habit.  I roll up a cig out of habit, look at it for awhile like, ""huh... I want me to smoke that?"" after a minute I light up, cuz I got em I smoke em.  A few puffs in and I remember how good it feels to smoke.  A few puffs later I'm reminding myself there's a cig in my hand... gross... but hey might as well finish it... shouldn't be wasteful.  I get halfway through and I'm putting it out.

The mushrooms are the only thing that's changed.  Haven't changed my diet, working out even less than before.  Maybe they're doing something for my body-mind to mellow it out and become healthy.  Just a suggestion.

I was wondering if anyone has a spare base or boiler (post millenium) laying around and would be kind enough to take a measurement for me.

I am planning to remove the base and mount the Europiccola directly into my coffee table. For this the idea is to carve out a square of the main wood plate. I then plan on sinking a square stainless steel plate into the wood. The machine is supposed to be mounted through that plate. To get the correct size machined; I must know the size of the hole that I need.

Now that I learned how tedious it is to remove the base; I thought it might save me a lot of trouble to just ask here if someone has the measurement as I couldn’t find it anywhere online.

Recently, I’ve switched up my caffeine a bit. I have started with a decaf coffee on the way to the gym, then drink an energy drink right after my workout. It makes for a nice treat on the 20 min drive home. So far I’ve been having the Lucky brand. Hard find it seems tho? Now: I am FLOORED by the difference in my energy. I actually FEEL the caffeine. Like the drug euphoric high from it. Love the taste. Of course I also love the taste of coffee, but I am shocked by the difference in how the drink seems to affect me for the same caffeine amount (200 mg.) I have a Nespresso so my cup of coffee was a vertuo pod around 200. 

I’ll ride this caffeine wave from about 7-9 AM from the one energy drink, and then grab an iced latte mid morning after breakfast. I’d say I’m getting 400 mg of caffeine between the two, which is where I’d like to cap it. 

For the drink itself. In the past, I’ve dabbled with trying a drink like an Aulani or a Celcius can, and TBH some tastes way to syrupy or artificial, and I got a heart racing feeling sometimes. So I stopped drinking those. Is there something different about the larger more carbonated cans like Lucky that is working for me? 

Questions, or crowdsourcing I should call it: Has anyone else noticed a similar comparison between coffee and energy drinks? 
Is there an energy drink you’d recommend I try next? I’m very health conscious, and know these may not be the best but man I can see how they are addicting. ",1,1743944162.0,energydrinks,15,0.67,False

For reference, this is the most expensive rent in my city with claims of the best luxury. I moved here in hope of not having to deal with normal landlord bs, as it was advertised as the best there is 5* hotel living, with concierges and 24/7 security etc. 

I’ve been here since the fall, and the bathroom is in the centre of my 1000sq ft 2 bedroom unit, so it has no window. The bathroom exhaust, whenever on, seems to directly flow into the HVAC vents in the ceiling, so if I’m having my morning coffee on the living room sofa, or dining room, or really anywhere, and my partner is going #2, I get a strong direct stream of the smells through the vents from above. There is seemingly no way to fix this.

Has anyone else encountered this? Is this grounds for terminating a lease early and asking the landlord to pay moving expenses? Is this something the landlord can fix without relocating tenants?

- i’ve noticed he looks my direction a lot when we’re in group settings. even when im not speaking and someone else is, i catch him looking at me.
- he’s so kind to me but also kind to other people so i wont use that as an example but still he’s so fucking nice.
- he asks for my advice and help.
- he sometimes pays for my coffee, but i think it’s in his culture.
- he asked me for dinner today and didn’t ask anyone else around in the office, so we went just us 2 to eat. and he let me pick the restaurant. (for context usually we go around asking people if they want dinner, but today his best friend wasn’t here and he didn’t seem to ask anyone else, and i didn’t either)
- his eyes are so warm when he looks at me.
- he laughs at my unfunny jokes
- he playfully touches my arm or leg when we’re drinking and laughing
- a couple times when we were walking somewhere in a group and i was walking behind everyone else he looked back to make sure i’m still there
- only person that waits for me to tie my shoes when we’re walking somewhere in a group
- told me how nice i am and how he’s trying to learn english to talk to me more and be closer to (that was 3 months ago)
- offered to drive me across town to pick up something for myself
- reminds me that i can always ask for his help in uni or with moving (since im thinking of moving)
- when he found out about some bad news he came to tell me as soon as he got to uni, he wanted comfort
- says hi and bye to me every time he comes and goes from the office, and no one else (except his roommate/best friend)

but all of this can be interpreted to just him being a good and observant person

why i don’t think he likes me: 
- broke up with his gf in january and when someone asked him if he’s ready for a new relationship he said don’t think so 
- mentions his ex too much as a joke or when we pass by her department or house
- he treats everyone nicely

1jstfdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreserveThatFood/comments/1jstfdj/how_vacuum_sealing_keeps_food_fresh_longer/,How Vacuum Sealing Keeps Food Fresh Longer,"# Chef's Guide: How Vacuum Sealing Revolutionizes Food Preservation - Triple Your Shelf Life!

As a chef who's seen countless ingredients wasted over the years, discovering vacuum sealing technology was genuinely game-changing for both my professional and home kitchen. This preservation method extends shelf life up to **3-5 times longer** than conventional storage, and I'm excited to share why it works and how you can implement it.

## The Science of Food Decay: Why Oxygen Is the Enemy

That fresh produce turning brown? Those leftovers developing fuzzy patches? Blame oxygen! This seemingly innocent molecule creates the perfect environment for:

* Aerobic bacteria and mold growth
* Oxidation (causing oils and fats to become rancid)
* Enzymatic browning (those unappetizing brown spots on cut fruits)
* Moisture loss (leading to dried-out, tough textures)

By removing oxygen through vacuum sealing, you essentially hit the ""pause"" button on these natural decay processes. Your food maintains its flavor profile, nutritional value, and textural integrity for significantly longer.

## Preservation Benefits That Changed My Kitchen Game

In my years of cooking professionally, I've found vacuum sealing offers remarkable benefits:

1. **Extended shelf life**: Food stays fresh 3-5 times longer
2. **Preserved flavor and texture**: No more dried-out meats or wilted vegetables
3. **Eliminated freezer burn**: Perfect for batch cooking and meal prep
4. **Reduced food waste**: Lower your grocery bill and environmental impact
5. **Space efficiency**: Vacuum-sealed packages take up less freezer/fridge space

## Best Foods for Vacuum Sealing (And What to Avoid)

### Vacuum Sealing Champions:

| Food Category | Standard Shelf Life | Vacuum Sealed Life | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Meat/Poultry/Fish | 6-12 months (frozen) | 1-3 years (frozen) | Perfect for bulk purchases |
| Hard Cheeses | 1-2 weeks | 4-8 weeks | Cut into portions first |
| Fruits/Vegetables | 3-7 days | 1-2 weeks | Blanch vegetables first |
| Dry Goods (rice, coffee) | 6 months | 2-3 years | Prevents staleness and pest infestation |
| Sous vide prepared meals | 3-4 days | 1-2 weeks | Ready for quick reheating |

### Foods to Avoid Vacuum Sealing:
* Soft cheeses (they'll compress to a paste)
* Raw mushrooms (risk of anaerobic bacteria)
* Fresh garlic (potential botulism risk)
* Cruciferous vegetables (they'll release gases and expand the bag)

## Essential Equipment for Successful Vacuum Sealing

After testing dozens of setups, here's what I recommend:

**Basic Setup:**
* Quality countertop vacuum sealer ($60-300 range)
* Vacuum sealer bags or rolls (BPA-free)
* Container attachments for delicate items

**For Serious Food Preservation:**
* Chamber vacuum sealer (for liquids and moist foods)
* Mason jar attachments (perfect for dry goods)
* Bag cutter and storage solution

## Chef's Tips for Maximum Freshness

I've learned these techniques through years of trial and error:

1. **Pre-freeze soft or moist foods** before sealing to prevent crushing and liquid extraction
2. **Leave 1-inch headspace** when sealing items that might expand
3. **Pat dry meat and fish** thoroughly before sealing for best results
4. **Use the ""pulse"" vacuum function** for delicate items like berries
5. **Label everything** with contents AND date (trust me, you won't remember)
6. **Store vacuum-sealed items properly** - maintain consistent temperatures

## Why Every Home Cook Should Consider This Method

As a chef, I've reduced my kitchen waste by nearly 70% since incorporating vacuum sealing into my routine. Beyond the obvious financial savings, the convenience of having properly preserved ingredients ready at a moment's notice has transformed my cooking.

Whether you're meal prepping, buying in bulk, preserving garden harvests, or simply trying to reduce food waste, vacuum sealing is a worthwhile investment that pays for itself surprisingly quickly.

1jstcbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1jstcbt/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743943664.0,Nonsleep,1,1.0,False

We are still only 30 and our sex life is pretty much non existent. Over the last year and a half it’s been 1 time per month if I’m lucky, it can often go a couple of months with nothing, I try very often but she always refuses (I know 100% she’s not talking to anyone else or cheating so that isn’t even on the table) I’m not a big headed person but I am a good looking guy, I used to get told by a lot of girls in the past and even still today.

For probably the first time since I've used dating apps, the conversation was flowing, no stereotypical same topics like ""so what do you do? What are you looking for here"". We've been texting daily, and I started to feel good about it, looking forward to meeting her irl. From the start, she did tell me that she wouldn't be able to meet up until mid-April because of pre established plans (concerts, drinks with friends, going away for a week of holidays...). At first, I was fine with it and told her so, but now it's starting to feel a bit long. I am resenting the fact that she can't find one hour in her week just to grab coffee. To me, it sounds like she's not really motivated to take this further.
Also, her response time, which has been pretty consistent (from a few hours to half a day) just went up to more than 24hours (my last text to her was yesterday and she still hasn't opened it).
I now feel like she's starting to ghost me. She did tell me yesterday that she was going to a concert that night and that after that she was preparing for her holidays, but still. Not even taking the time to answer a text where I actively tell her that I finish my shift in half an hour and can therefore meet up, is at best disinterested, at worst disrespectful and rude.

1jst62t,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsales/comments/1jst62t/what_to_do_when_the_system_is_broken/,What to do when the system is broken,"We all operate within systems and structures that we cannot escape.

Companies are systems that are part of larger systems such as states.

These systems are man-made theoretical constructs that in turn are based on other theoretical constructs such as contracts or legal forms.

Unless you want to live as a self-sufficient hermit in the wilderness, you will always have to rely on these systems.

The only problem is that the entire system is based on contradictions.

Employer associations demand more performance from employees and propagate that people are no longer willing to perform, while wages have not increased at all in proportion to profits. The middle class is supposed to pay a lot of taxes and duties, while the super-rich always manage to get by thanks to tax optimization constructs. Performance is celebrated – but only as long as it fits into the narrative. Inheritance, power, networks? That is usually left out.

These systems are not built for justice or meritocracy, but for stability, maintaining power and control.

I don’t want to start a political discussion.

But to transfer this to tech sales.

The good news first: if you’ve made it into tech sales as an account executive, then you’ve already navigated the system well as an employee, because you’ll probably make more than 90% of the population.

Now the bad news: tech sales is also a system and it’s usually not fair. What’s more, it can even be extremely unfair and cost you your job.

The following are scenarios that my friends and I have already experienced:

A rep’s book of business (the accounts they service) is 3-4 times larger than that of another rep in terms of volume (what the accounts spend per year), even though the targets are almost identical

* Inbound leads are distributed by the managers manually to their favorites
* Territories are completely unfairly tailored, e.g. one rep is responsible for California, the other for Arizona
* All kinds of side agreements are made, the same rules do not apply to everyone

The problem: it can cost you your job, your self-esteem and you begin to question your values.

But you can sell without losing yourself. Ethics (and I don’t mean hypocrisy here, but integrity) and performance are not a contradiction.

Two thoughts on what to do when you are in such a system:

1. Choose systems that are as fair as possible and in which you can win

This means mastering the application process. Pick a company in which a large number of salespeople achieve their goals. Find out in advance what the ramp time is, the turnover in the team, and whether promotions are made internally. Find out what the territory will be and what the quota is. What the average deal size is and then calculate for yourself whether the targets are realistic. Write to people from the team on LinkedIn and ask for a coffee chat. Write to people who have already left and ask why.

Systems will also change. You can win 10 years in a row, only to be the loser after a restructuring and realize that it wasn’t just your own greatness that helped you to that fortune, but that you were in the right place at the right time.

Which, by the way, is the next factor. To join a company whose product is hot and in high demand. A company that grows at 100% has to hire a lot of new people every year and will also promote some of them internally.

But if you still can’t get the promotion internally, then you have to switch to a new system.

You are, so to speak, the wanderer between the systems. An entrepreneur who provides his labor.  
  
2. Create your own playing field

Fortunately, tech sales is still one of the few jobs that allows you to build wealth. Whether it’s through stock packages, or investing your commission in assets.

For me, that’s one of the keys to freedom. Financial freedom. Having enough money so you no longer have to work, but can choose to work.

In addition to assets, hobbies and side projects are of course also an option. Don’t be blinded by all the success stories, it’s damn hard to be successful, but it is possible. Those who manage to build up a second source of income over 10 years may not have to work at all, or only 20 hours.",1,1743943091.0,techsales,4,0.67,False

1jst55b,https://i.redd.it/2gj6beuuk7te1.png,I Built a Nutrition Tracking app with features I wanted from multiple apps.,"During my last semester break, I got obsessed with calorie tracking and ended up juggling multiple apps to keep tabs on my intake. Each app had its killer feature that I couldn’t get enough of, and I started dreaming of a single app that could bring all those standout tools together. So, I pinged my friend and we decided to take a crack at building it ourselves. What I thought would be a quick weekend side project spiraled into an epic adventure.

I included all the features that I liked from the different apps I used.

A reliable database: We obtain food data from a comprehensive, high-quality database. This database primarily includes Western and European foods and information from package labels. We will soon add data from additional countries.

AI photo logging: Click a photo of your meal and get the estimates for calories and other macros. It's pretty handy when at a restaurant where the nutritional values of food are not listed.

AI meal description: If you forgot to take a picture before eating, describe what you ate afterward to log it. Works similarly to food logging.

Barcode scanning: The feature is very quick and snappy, retrieving data from a vast open-source database.

Progress tracking: Uses intuitive graphs to track your steps, weight, and daily macros intake.

No ads and Privacy focused: Users can sign in with Apple to protect their privacy. No ads.

Integration with Apple: The app has dynamic widgets and integrates with the Apple Health app.

The next feature I'm working on is a dynamic nutrition coach that calculates goals based on the user's personal progress, i.e., instead of a general formula for all users, it dynamically changes from user to user weekly, guiding the user like a personal coach.

 The app is called **MacroBalance** and is available on iOS. Check it out: [https://apps.apple.com/in/app/macrobalance/id6743542972](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/macrobalance/id6743542972)",6,1743943008.0,SideProject,3,1.0,False

1jssv77,https://i.redd.it/rgc459b4j7te1.png,"+1 year growing a Twitter account, here is what you need to know","(This feels illegal to post for free, but here we are)

These are some advice I would give as someone who grew an X account to about 600 subs and +10k posts views.

1. Nobody Cares About You (Yet)

Stop tweeting like you’re famous. You’re not. Nobody cares about your morning coffee or random shower thoughts. Not yet. Post what helps them, not what entertains you. Position yourself as useful for now.

2. Your Bio and PFP Are Make or Break
Make it dead obvious who you are, what you do, and why someone should follow.

Bio: One line. One niche. One reason.

PFP: Clear face or clean logo. No anime unless you're in that space.

Banner: Authority, proof, or vibes

3. Pick a Niche and OWN It

Trying to post about crypto, mindset, fitness, anime, and memes? Congrats, you’re confusing everyone.

If your goal is to grow a following that you can sell a product to later, you want to show them exactly what your acc is about.

Stick to 1-2 core topics. Let your audience know what to expect when they hit follow.

4. Post Less. Engage More.

This is the golden rule. Most accounts don’t grow because they’re too busy tweeting into the void.
Here’s what actually works:

Leave 30 comments per day under bigger accounts in your niche.

Bring value, ask questions, make people feel your presence.

Don’t be a bot. Be sharp, be funny, be helpful.
You want people thinking: “Who is this guy?”

5. One Fire Thread Beats 50 Mid Tweets
Stop throwing out lazy tweets all day. Write 1 banger thread per week.
Structure it like this:

Hook line that punches

3, 5 valuable points

Personal experience or example

CTA at the end: “Follow for more X”
Good threads get bookmarked, shared, and followed. That’s leverage.

1jssr2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jssr2j,"""Old"" American Chinese food showdown in California!","While I'm not a big fan of American Chinese food, it's interesting to see what some of the ""historic"" (long running) or else just stuck-in-the-past restaurants offer.

I'm not talking about General Zuo's/Orange Chicken variety of American Chinese food, but rather the kind that evokes mid-20th century and earlier.

Truth be told, I usually end up disliking the food, more or less—not because I am prejudiced against it, just because it's not to my taste. The experience ends up become more like something that was just fun and interesting to visit and see what they offer.

But two of these places were OK, and one of those I was pretty happy with.

The ""winner"" is **Chicago Café in Woodland, California**. The current claim is that they are the oldest continually operating Chinese restaurant in America.

Chicago Café is a legit diner in its own right that also happens to sell very retro Chinese food.

Slide 1 shows their combo plate with fried rice, egg fu yung, fried shrimp, and chow mein. The ""chow mein"" consists of ""chop suey"" on top of the crispy La Choy thingies. They also offer it on top of different types of noodle. The plate is preceded by a bowl of vegetable soup and saltines, diner style. The bits of BBQ pork on top of it all remind me of the instructions in most recipes in Shiu Wong Chan's The Chinese Cook Book (1917), which always says ""garnish with Chinese ham""! The gravy on the fu yung dan is a thin, soy one. I finished it all—even though I was mad for making the mistake of getting the La Choy noodles. (I thought by crispy noodles they meant it would be like 两面黄.) Cup of endless refill diner coffee to wash it down.

Next is **Bill Lee's Bamboo Chopsticks in Bakersfield**. I tried to get a similar ""combo plate."" It was also preceded by a soup and oyster crackers, but the soup was just like some awfully salty Knorr chicken powder broth.

Slide two shows the plate with ""almond diced chicken chow mein,"" long ""bbq spare ribs,"" fried shrimp (with lemon wedge!) and fried rice.  
Awful bland slurry of ""almond diced chicken"" on top, this time, plain soft noodles. Nothing ""chow"" about it. Bland fried rice. Was hilariously warned about the side mustard ""If you haven't had it before"" that it would be spicy. Could not finish it all...too bland and heavy. At least they give the traditional pot of oolong tea.

Next is **Tong Fong Low in Oroville**. Possibly, the ""third oldest Chinese restaurant in America."" They mix dishes that seem like they could be similar to the earliest days with some of the more recent American Chinese dishes.

Pictured in Slide 3 is their chop suey with pork. In classic style, the chop suey is mainly bean sprouts. I ordered it to imagine what their popular dish might have been back in the day. Though I don't love chop suey in any form, this was decent. There was nothing thick and stewed about it. It was just sprouts lightly stir fried with pork and cabbage thrown in, and I could imagine this among normal/authentic Chinese cooking.

Then comes an odd one, **Mee Heng Low in San Luis Obispo**. It stands in SLO's former Chinatown as a place established in the 1920s. However, with the changes in ownership over the years and with about zero Asian people in the area, I feel like the current iteration is just making things up. All the food looks like an English person who had never eaten Chinese food might just invent out of the imagination and without proper access to ingredients.

Slide 4, believe it or not, is their chop suey with pork. Compare it to the previous Tong Fong Low to see how bizarre it is. It's primarily noodles, undercooked. The pork is weird pork loin medallions sliced in half. All the dishes include some weird strips of carrot. There is watery soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl. It tastes like no other seasoning. Did I say weird? I just don't get what they're thinking.

Last is the scariest one. **Hong Kong Chop Suey in Hanford**. Very retro, but not necessarily very old at all, but rather more owing to the tastes in this remote rural area.

Slide 5 is chow mein (combo or house style, I guess). On the La Choy crispies. They there in every California farm vegetable imaginable. Strange slices of country ham just placed on top. In the back is thick, doughy egg fu yung with some yellow gravy. I took two bites and could not continue. I felt bad and the server was really confused why I would want to just leave without finishing and without taking the leftovers. It was that bad.

I'd go back to Chicago Café any time, maybe pair a Chinese dish with some bacon and eggs. Hanford I'd never go back to; if in town, just eat a burger at a fast food restaurant. Tong Fong Low is a good lunch, if you order the right dishes, if you're visiting Chinese history in the area. Don't bother with San Luis Obispo. Eat Mexican food, instead, in Bakersfield!",1,1743941667.0,chinesefood2,0,1.0,False

It’s bizarre. At later 25, restarting just ten mg of Dexedrine began to hurt my right shoulder - and this was right when I began to really decompensate psychotically. I’ve been on and off Vyvanse and Dexedrine since I was 18 with no problems. 

Dexedrine and Vyvanse also stopped working for me; no focus, no good feelings, just pain and decompensation - and a movement disorder. 

I eventually started Lurasidone 40mg (later 60mg) and it took away the pain. It also made ADHD medication work 1000x better than they should bad produce extreme euphoria. 

Then I went off of Lurasidone, since it caused a stimulant use disorder with the ADHD meds, and the pain came back - excruciatingly due to Vyvanse I was on. I was taken off of Vyvanse fully at an IP, but now even coffee or nicotine causes it and I often need Tylenol. 

My entire upper right sided is crackily and knotted, and it goes into my head and jaw, and joints in the area. It really hurts. 

They put me on what is now 300MG of Seroquel and 900MG of lithium. It’s almost been three weeks since I’ve been here; it doesn’t seem like the Seroquel is doing much in multiple ways. 

I can’t restart Lurasidone since it caused a stimulant use disorder.
