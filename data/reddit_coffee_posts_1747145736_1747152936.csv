1klpy6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxgamedev/comments/1klpy6v/i_started_learning_luau_5_months_ago_this_is_what/,I started learning Luau 5 months ago. This is what I‚Äôve learned.,"**Background story:**

On January 6th, my friend asked me if I wanted to make a game with him: *""a dungeon game where you spawn at an entrance, fight a boss, and complete the game.""* That was his vision for the project. For the first two months, we experimented on this idea, creating different systems without a clear plan. It was a fun learning experience, and we didn‚Äôt put any pressure on each other. He was really invested in the project and taught me everything he discovered, helping me with scripts whenever I got stuck.

It was a lot of fun, and it still is. The game has developed into a much bigger project, and now we‚Äôre building an MMO because our ideas naturally evolved in that direction.

**Things I‚Äôve learned in these 5 months:**

When thinking about something big, divide it into very small pieces. The big project will become much more doable.

Your first scripts will suck, but every time you refine or redo an old system, you‚Äôll do a better and better job. **Example:** I‚Äôve redone the quest system in my game 7 times to make it unbreakable when adding new quests, and I automated the rewards given.

Use tutorials to learn the basics, then start creating. I know for some people it‚Äôs boring to watch videos, or you might feel like you‚Äôre not learning anything after watching one. In my opinion, you can start creating once you understand how to use tables, loops, and functions.

Use AI to get a starting point, BUT don‚Äôt ask for a whole system.

**Example:** Let‚Äôs say you want to create a button that, when pressed, starts a timer and then spawns something after it ends. When working on it, ask small questions like:This will force you to think and connect the dots. If you still don‚Äôt understand how something works, ask the AI *why* it works. And if you still don‚Äôt get it, don‚Äôt worry practice will teach you over time.

What you eat is very important. I‚Äôve observed this myself: in the morning, when I don‚Äôt eat, I tend to be more productive, and ideas flow easily. But after eating something with sugar or any processed food, my brain slows down and thinking becomes a nightmare. I recommend going for salads or any unprocessed foods. Honey is a great energy boost. Coffee or if you‚Äôre a child, green tea will do the trick.

Some days you won‚Äôt feel like working, but those days are the most important. They‚Äôre what make the difference between someone who sticks with it long term and someone who quits. If you don‚Äôt feel like coding, you probably have a thought in your mind that your brain perceives as too hard to achieve. In that case, break that thought down into something smaller.  
**Example:** Saying *‚ÄúI have to make this whole system today‚Äù* might discourage you before you even start. Instead, say *‚ÄúI‚Äôll do this small part of the system today, and if I feel like doing more, I will.‚Äù*

**Progress is progress.** If one day you code an entire system by yourself and the next day you only manage to do something small in comparison, don‚Äôt think of it as a loss. It‚Äôs actually a **very big win.** It doesn‚Äôt matter if yesterday you spent 8 hours coding and today just 20 minutes **progress is progress**, and it will add up over time.

**Social media makes you not want to do the work.** After spending some time on your phone, you might feel less motivated to start coding because your brain just wants to chase dopamine. And the easiest way for the brain to get that is by scrolling and watching random content. But that‚Äôs not something you can really be proud of.  
Instead, think about the moments when you created something cool from scratch or even with a little help from AI. You built the system, you handled the errors. I know you feel good after finishing something that seemed hard to code at first.  
If you haven‚Äôt had that feeling yet, just start a project, build on it, and be proud of what you‚Äôve created.

**My Project with My Friend**

After a lot of reworks, most of the systems we built in the first 3 months were either deleted or improved for better performance.

**The Game Idea:**

You spawn in *The Springland*, a place infested by toxic flowers. Starting with just your fists, you fight your way through increasingly stronger enemies and craft better weapons from sticks, rods, and claws, to even a scythe making yourself stronger by using potions.

Each weapon has 3 attacks, and the third one is always very fast. With it, you can deal damage 5 to 12 times in just 1 second.

**The game is focused on** **PvP**.  
You can fight other players anywhere, without losing your loot, as long as you have PvP turned on. There are also **PvP zones** located around boss spawns, where **full loot drop** is enabled on death.

**In these 5 months, we've built the following systems:**

**Level and Experience** ‚Äì Increases when killing monsters and defeating players

**Stats** ‚Äì Allows you to assign a point at each level into attributes like Fists, Weapon Damage, Heal, Heal Regen, and Walk Speed, to customize your character.

**Party** ‚Äì Has no member limit. It allows members to split experience and coins, and prevents them from damaging each other in PvP zones or when PvP is turned on.

**Coins** ‚Äì Can be obtained by selling items to the shop, killing players and talking to certain NPC, or defeating monsters.

**Blacksmith** ‚Äì Crafts weapons using weapon parts dropped by enemies. Has a 50% success rate. There's also a 100% success blacksmith located in the PvP zone, but crafting there costs 7 times more coins.

**Potions** ‚Äì Temporarily increase your stats. There are both static and percentage-based potions, and they can be used simultaneously.

**Chests** ‚Äì Spawn in different locations on the map. If more than 3 players are near a tier 2 or tier 3 chest, an arena spawns and the zone inside arena becomes full loot drop until the chest is claimed.

**Quest System** ‚Äì Introduces players to all game systems and provides a clear path to follow.

**Capture Zone** ‚Äì When captured, grants a 200% bonus XP on every monster kill. If one party member controls the zone, the bonus applies to all members.

**Stealing** ‚Äì Offers an alternative source of income by allowing players to steal potions from shelves near the shop.

**Weapons** ‚Äì Each has different range and attack types. Every third attack is a special one that deals damage very rapidly.

**Shop** ‚Äì Lets players sell all in-game items, buy potions, and buy weapon parts, but at very high prices, encouraging players to farm rather than buy.

**Slayer System** ‚Äì Increases damage against monsters. Each level gives +3 damage. Slayer level is increased by killing monsters or completing tasks.

**Affiliate System** ‚Äì Gives players a share of what their referrals spend in Robux. Using someone‚Äôs affiliate code grants a special item that helps when starting out.

**Enemies** ‚Äì We've built a custom system to handle hundreds of monsters without performance issues. Roblox‚Äôs built-in `MoveTo` was a nightmare to work with.

**What's Coming Next**

We don‚Äôt consider this game finished. We see it as a beta version for now, and the following systems are planned to make the game more enjoyable. Once these updates are implemented, we‚Äôll begin promoting the game more aggressively.

Upcoming features include:  
Auction House, Mining, Woodcutting, Skinning, Armors, Crystals for weapons and armors, Random Events, and gameplay elements based on luck.

**Wrong.**



What you call communication is just collision.

>No mutuality.

Only auto-triggered sound patterns clashing in real time, wrapped in the hallucination of meaning.

1klpv1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1klpv1z/what_do_you_guys_do_to_get_over_a_breakup/,What do you guys do to get over a breakup?,"I (23M) recently had a breakup that dragged on a bit. After she‚Äôd initially called things after 5 years, i spent some time working on a lot of the issues that I had that contributed to the breakup, and had been holding on to some Hope of reconciliation. Last weekend we talked again, and she said she needed time to focus on herself and wasn‚Äôt interested in having a relationship, but she also had offhandedly mentioned that she‚Äôs been ‚Äúgoing out with people for the free food‚Äù. In any case, she reached out to exchange the last of our things and catch up over coffee, only to cancel it later saying that she felt it wasn‚Äôt wise for us to see each other in person (which I understood as during our longer conversation last weekend, I‚Äôd mentioned I did still love her but respected her decision to end the relationship and wishes for space). This past weekend she stopped by my house and we exchanged the last of our stuff, but I could tell she had been trying to avoid seeing me and wanted to be pretty much anywhere else in the work. At this point, though i know we care about each other it‚Äôs pretty clear to me that any Hope of a relationship in the near future is gone. Maybe someday if the stars align but not for the foreseeable future. 

That being said, what have you guys done after a breakup to help the healing process? This was my first relationship, and it lasted from 18-23, so I‚Äôm in a totally different place in my life than when we got together and I‚Äôm just at a loss. I miss her dearly, as she was my best friend and I wish things had worked out differently, but I know I need to focus on myself.

1klpuqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1klpuqg/im_27_m_watching_my_roommate_28_m_slowly_descend/,I‚Äôm (27 M) watching my roommate (28 M) slowly descend into religious extremism. It‚Äôs very disturbing.,"This is going to be a long one, but those of you who make it to the end will know that I‚Äôd be doing a disservice by leaving any of this out. This is one of the crazier things that‚Äôs happened in my life, so I suppose I‚Äôm looking for advice but I‚Äôm also just disturbed and can‚Äôt keep it to myself. I‚Äôll try to be as concise as possible. I promise this isn‚Äôt just another low-brow ‚Äúreligion bad‚Äù post.

I know some of this will sound outlandish. If I weren‚Äôt living it I would think it was the plot of a South Park episode. Not because it‚Äôs funny, but because it‚Äôs so over the top that it‚Äôs bordering on parody at this point.

I have no problem at all with religious people or even the concept of religion if people find it fulfilling, but what I‚Äôm observing in my roommate has become something very different from typical Christianity. We‚Äôve lived together for the past 18 months and still have eight months left on our lease. We‚Äôve been friends for around six years. Before moving in together I knew he believed in God, read the Bible often and went to church on Sundays, but there was no indication that his beliefs would intensify the way they have over the past year and a half. He knows I don‚Äôt subscribe to any organized religion but has tried to recruit me in various ways.

Over time, he slowly started talking more about ways he thought God was communicating with him and would frequently tell me God was ‚Äútelling him‚Äù things. I understand this can be considered a normal part of religion, but these would range from things like ‚ÄúGod told me to sit in the front row at church today‚Äù to hyper-specific things like ‚ÄúI was walking past a woman on the street and God told me she needed help cleaning her pool. I walked up to her and asked her if she needed help.‚Äù

I initially dismissed this as him innocently becoming more excited about religion and felt bad for judging him. I found it strange, but smiled and nodded and accepted that I just don‚Äôt understand.

A few weeks after this became prevalent, I was sitting in my bedroom on a Saturday morning and heard weeping coming from his room. I was obviously concerned so I went and knocked on his door to make sure he was okay. He told me to come in and I found him at his desk, hunched over his Bible, crying as he was reading it because he said ‚Äúthe scripture shapes and impacts his life every day.‚Äù He has since told me that crying while reading his Bible has become a regular occurrence.

He‚Äôs also become much more invested in pushing religion on other people. For me, it started with gift giving. For Christmas he got me something small based on one of my interests, along with rosary beads, a Bible and prayer cards. He will probe often into whether I‚Äôve read any of the Bible (I‚Äôve skimmed some passages as it was a gift and I didn‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful). Again, I felt bad for finding this odd at the time since I know he has good intentions and he‚Äôs a friend I care about.

One day I was sitting in his room and noticed a packet of paper on his desk. I asked him what it was and started flipping through it. It was a detailed guide on how to approach strangers in public with the specific intention of guiding the conversation toward religion and trying to ‚Äúspread the good word.‚Äù It followed some sort of process like ‚ÄúFirst, give the person a compliment so they feel comfortable and appreciated. Then, tell them they‚Äôre a child of God and ask if you can hold their hands and pray for them. If they decline, ask them why.‚Äù Yet again, I found this odd, pushy, and out of character for him, but dismissed my concerns as being too harsh.

**_Now, this is where I stopped dismissing my concerns._**

When we first moved in, he celebrated by buying us a bottle of our favorite expensive liquor. He insisted it was a gift from him and for us to share and that I had free access to it. I don‚Äôt drink often, but was excited for us to enjoy it on the weekends. It sat in our freezer for a while untouched, and one Friday night I suggested that we break it out since we were just chilling at home. He told me that he took the bottle out of the freezer and threw it in the dumpster days ago. I thought he was joking and laughed, and then he told me he did it because God told him that he ‚Äúhad to make a decision about whether he‚Äôd rather serve Him or his earthly desires‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe choice was clear.‚Äù This crossed the line into full-blown delusion for me, but it gets worse.

He has a tech job in our city that he‚Äôs averagely-successful at. He came home from work one day wearing a suit, which is different from his usual attire. I asked him what the special occasion was and he told me that he left work early to drive an hour and a half in the opposite direction of where we live to interview for a new job where he‚Äôll get to try and convert people to Christianity. He told me he would leave his tech job that provides him benefits like health insurance and his 401(k) in order to take a massive pay cut and work 20 hours a week in an office that brainstorms ways to convert people to Christianity. I‚Äôm unclear on how this is a paid position, but he claims it is. We‚Äôre obviously too old to be on anyone else‚Äôs health insurance at this point, so this seems extremely irresponsible and reckless to me.

**The last straw was a few days ago when he brought three people from his church over to our apartment for Bible study.** It was a group of about eight of them. They were having a discussion in the living room while I was cooking myself dinner in the kitchen a few feet away. He‚Äôs had them over before and they‚Äôve always been kind to me so I don‚Äôt mind, but as I was cooking I was listening to their conversation and it was extremely unsettling.

Some of his friends were talking about wanting to join a group of people that claim to have ‚Äúholy visions‚Äù of random people in random areas and then actively go searching for those imagined people because they think God is telling them to find those people to pray for them. The example his one friend gave was that the group had a ‚Äúshared holy vision‚Äù of a girl in a coffee shop with a pink water bottle who was wearing a white shirt and jeans. The group then searched coffee shops in our city to try and find the girl on the very day they imagined her so they could pray for her.

His friends tried to engage me in conversation while I was cooking by asking me what my plans for the night were. I told them I was binge watching all the Scream movies and that I‚Äôm a big horror movie fan. They told me that they detest horror movies because they ‚Äúglorify death in a way that is not in line with scripture.‚Äù His one friend said that he liked the first Scream movie, but immediately after saying it became noticeably distressed and immediately backtracked and claimed he actually did not like the movie. It was like he believed God was in the room and listening to the conversation and he had to dispel it immediately or God would become angry at him. Again, disturbing to witness.

**The absolute cherry on top/where I draw the line** is that one of the members of his Bible study is clearly a gay man. I‚Äôm a bisexual man myself (not to my roommate‚Äôs knowledge, and he‚Äôll never find out at this point) so I‚Äôm absolutely not judging his friend at all, I‚Äôm just being honest that it‚Äôs extremely obvious. One day my roommate told me unprompted that the friend in question ‚Äúwas gay before he opened himself up to the Holy Spirit.‚Äù I was understandably stunned that a man in his 20s would believe such a thing is even possible in today‚Äôs world, so I pushed back lightly by asking ‚Äúdo you believe that‚Äôs possible?‚Äù and he claimed that ‚ÄúGod puts in your heart what you need.‚Äù My roommate then went on to say he viewed it as a positive that his friend‚Äôs story ‚Äúcan help people in the same situation.‚Äù What‚Äôs most unsettling is that his friend is 39 years old, has no current or former relationship with a woman and claims to be ‚Äúenjoying the single life.‚Äù My roommate is unable to make the leap in logic that his friend is still gay.

I‚Äôve never told him about my sexuality because I don‚Äôt really care to (I would tell him if he asked, I‚Äôm just more of a private person) but seeing that shift in him in particular made it apparent to me that I‚Äôve completely lost him. He‚Äôs on the highway to religious extremism and has insulated himself in a community that reinforces everything I‚Äôve described.

I've spent weeks going about my daily activities wearing these walking shoes, and there‚Äôs definitely a lot to unpack here.

But as much as I‚Äôve enjoyed them, there are a few things worth pointing out that could sway your decision if you‚Äôre considering adding these to your wardrobe.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The first thing I noticed was how sleek yet functional these shoes looked. The woven fabric and mesh upper give a modern, lightweight vibe that pairs effortlessly with casual styles. They‚Äôre not bulky, which is a relief for someone like me who dislikes walking shoes that resemble mini tanks. The simplicity in design, combined with subtle Skechers branding, ensures they complement a range of outfits. Although stylish, the all-fabric upper might not withstand rough use, especially in muddy or wet terrains. It‚Äôs a tradeoff, but one I personally don‚Äôt mind given the aesthetic.

**Foot Security and Slip-In Experience**

This ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù feature had me skeptical initially, but the exclusive Heel Pillow designed to hold your foot securely in place? It really works. No fussing with laces or bending over to adjust anything. The pull-on closure style, combined with the snug Heel Pillow, makes slipping these on a smooth and quick process. I could easily head out the door while juggling groceries, bags, or even a hyperactive pup. For those who prioritize hassle-free footwear, this feature alone is a game-changer.

**Unparalleled Everyday Comfort**

The moment I stepped into these shoes, it felt like walking on clouds, and the Skechers Air-Cooled Memory Foam insole deserves all the credit here. It adapts to the shape of your foot and provides consistent cushioning even after hours of wear. Pair this with the lightweight ULTRA GO midsole, and you‚Äôve got shoes that are comfortable for extended walks or being on your feet all day. That said, if you‚Äôre someone with high arches or specific orthopedic requirements, keep in mind these shoes don't offer significant arch support.

**Versatility Across Activities**

I tested these sneakers in various scenarios, from walking the dog to wearing them on light hiking trails. While they excel on flat, urban surfaces, they‚Äôre not built to tackle demanding terrains or wet, slippery paths. The ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sole provides decent traction but falls short in terms of grip if you stray into uneven landscapes. Honestly, though, I didn‚Äôt expect them to double as hiking shoes, and they shine exactly where they‚Äôre meant to‚Äîeveryday casual use.

**Advantages**

- Simple, stylish design that pairs well with everyday outfits.  
- Hands-free slip-in functionality enhances convenience.  
- Lightweight yet responsive cushioning makes long wears comfortable.  
- Air-Cooled Memory Foam insole is a standout feature for lasting comfort.  
- Machine washable for low-maintenance care.

**Critiques**

- Limited arch support may not suit users with specific foot needs.  
- Fabric upper is prone to wear and tear in rough conditions.  
- Sole grip performance isn‚Äôt suited for demanding terrain.

**Competing Products**

Comparing Skechers On The Go Flex Slip-ins to alternate options like Nike‚Äôs Tanjun Slip-On or Adidas Cloudfoam Pure sneakers, there are clear distinctions. While Nike excels with superior arch support and durability, their slip-on functionality doesn‚Äôt feel as seamless. Adidas Cloudfoam Pure, on the other hand, delivers competitive cushioning but lacks the practical hands-free feature Skechers nails so effortlessly. If convenience combined with casual style ranks high on your priority list, these flex slip-ins undoubtedly take the crown. Yet for professional or sports-grade shoes, the alternatives might inch ahead.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of bang for the buck, Skechers offers compelling value with this product. Features like hands-free design, Air-Cooled insoles, and Ultra GO cushioning add up to a unique combination you won‚Äôt often find in shoes at this price point. For someone looking for practicality and daily comfort, these are worth the investment. Just don‚Äôt expect them to perform like high-end athletic shoes in every scenario.

1klpp3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1klpp3w/to_be_well_adjusted_to_a_sick_society/,To be well adjusted to a sick society,"Dear You, 
during my college days, when I felt isolated in being taught about white guilt and privilege, feminism, and how western society oppressed minorities, something felt off. I am a minority now. I started swimming against the current, learning from a podcaster that men have been more than oppressed, and being a woman that has seen her father go through domestic violence by a narcassisic mother who to this day refuses to take responsibility for her role in my parents‚Äô marriage downfall because she was the true victim gives me the motivation in part to write to here today. 

Yesterday was Mother‚Äôs Day. And words can‚Äôt express the severe isolation I feel, however blessed and ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô I am, it is shocking to me where society has fallen out from grace. I was born in 1995, and having been a part of a married family wasn‚Äôt anything unusual. 

I‚Äôm just coming to some of the most life changing realizations of my life, and sincerely need to tell you what I experienced yesterday. I believe I am completely alone in a world and my generation especially had been taught to become adjusted to a profound degree of internalized guilt from being taught in college our race was toxic, then with the rise of social media, we became addicted to rage and hatred which divided us along fractured lines, our humanity was stolen along with our self respect, and the consequences lead me to what I witnessed yesterday. 

I am alone in having one family with grandparents still alive (for one) still married, who my BF of more than four years that I visited in the country yesterday for dessert and coffee. Being in the country, what is ‚Äònormal‚Äô doesn‚Äôt matter to us, although my BF and I have grown in ways where we can never undo the damage that severe mental health disorders and trauma still impacts us in the present. 

Then, my BF and I drove to our home city out of the country I grew up in, and visited his parents, both of them still married, and got ice cream downtown. His mother and father are first generation immigrants, and his mother is a deeply devoted Catholic. We had lunch, and walked to an ice cream place. Sitting outside, in the sunshine, surrounded by families where at first glance, nothing was out of place, his mother called her daughter, where we FaceTimed. I sat nested between this beautiful loving family, and the conversation flowed naturally from one state in the country to another.

I observed a young girl, in her nicest dress, watching us, with her single dad quietly eating his ice cream nearby. I looked around further to discover that I was wrong, we were the ones out of place, not one other family existed that hadn‚Äôt been somehow picked a part, like vultures had picked everything off of the bones of an animal. 

To be well adjusted to the United States Society is to be sick, my generation came from loving whole families, and we didn‚Äôt even have a voice to cry for help before destruction and chaos changed our lives forever. This is my call for help. It‚Äôs too late for my own parents‚Äô marriage, but what I know is I don‚Äôt have a single friend my age who I can count on. My father abandoned me, my jobs fired me before giving me a chance to make up for my mistakes. I‚Äôve lost my mind six times since 2018. My first BF broke up with me out of convenience rather than work through what was hard, and that‚Äôs the central theme in what I am saying.

 People don‚Äôt believe in themselves anymore, we‚Äôre not able to be confronted with the truth, I just lost a long term friendship because of this exact reason. As a society we are quick to say ‚Äòpoor me, it‚Äôs not my fault because I‚Äôm just helpless‚Äô rather than realize hey, I can do hard things I can face my fears. My mantra has been maybe it‚Äôs not my fault what I‚Äôm feeling but it is my responsibility to fix, I believe I am a victim of a lot of toxic abuse from people who hurt me, and because I trusted in those that never really had my best interests at heart, I do also feel to be victim of an inherently toxic and abusive society in not only the ways I‚Äôve witnessed our institutions use our trusting and willingness to learn to hurt us in ways that damaged us beyond believe. 

It‚Äôs not just the ‚Äòme too‚Äô era that caused us to hate ourselves and each other, we were taught to hate ourselves and blame each other for delusional stories our teachers told us. We weren‚Äôt taught statistics in college, we were taught that women carry invisible backpacks around which is a burden especially toxic for the ‚Äòprivileged white woman.‚Äô 

Because my generation trusted in those like my own father and brother when they said we had to go to college to be someone worth anything in the future, I was not only let down but made to believe it was my fault for being abandoned without any explanation why. I was taught to blame myself through college because of my white privilege, and the internalized shame and gaslighting led me down the darkest and most dangerous layers of hell that exists. 

I‚Äôm an addict. I surrounded myself with ‚Äòfriends‚Äô who I met while inpatient at an eating disorder treatment center. When I was most vulnerable, I trusted a person I connected with, and after getting not just discharged but blamed for something I didn‚Äôt do, I relapsed months later with this person. I fell from all the hard work I‚Äôd built over months of sobriety. I‚Äôm not making excuses for my behavior, it was my responsibility to have known better, but at the time it was impossible for me to have known that a person I cared so much about could hurt me in such cruel ways. Addiction is a disease of being blind to the cruelty of humanity and having been taught to be blind to abuse, I fell for this person‚Äôs toxic love because I was desperate during the end stages of a relationship with my ex boyfriend. 

This is part of my story, I‚Äôm reaching out to explain what I have observed so far in my home town, and because I have always looked up to you as a father I never had, I trust you with this information. Perhaps I‚Äôm wrong, I hope I am, but I‚Äôm expanding upon what I‚Äôve heard you and Sowell talk about with the targeting of nuclear families from the welfare state, our society is beyond sick. My BF‚Äôs mother works as a nurse at a crisis center to help those in the acute stages of addiction. 

My BF and I spent 18 months getting clean from Fentanyl, and observed a surge in people needing help from the Fentanyl crises with the methadone center we used. Not only are people addicted to anything and everything, we‚Äôre addicted to our own victim mentality and we believe it‚Äôs normal that the world is this way, when I know for a fact that my childhood was drastically different than what I face today. 

To me, it seems that those in power in the past have made people a target, or the enemy, and there‚Äôs a war going on that no one is talking about. People are incredibly sick not just physically but emotionally. My generation in particular I believe was the first of this massacre, we were indoctrinated with ideological hatred that only served to disarm us, divide us, and ultimately hurt us, and after a decade or more of this, I believe most of us our blind to the abuse we have rationalized away as ‚Äònormal.‚Äô

1klpoht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1klpoht/skip_church_for_a_hobby/,Skip Church For A Hobby?,"Hello fellow believers!
For context, I have been a Christian my whole life, but have recently been saved. 

For the past 6 months, my wife and I have been taking our faith a lot more seriously, and during one ""coffee chat"" with our pastor, I mentioned that some Sundays I miss church for one of my hobbies (autocross, which is a form of car racing). I had never seen that as an issue until our pastor brought up that living for Christ means we should not be putting anything in front of God. Since that conversation I've been wrestling with this a lot.

One one hand, fellowship with other believers is encouraged in the Bible and I genuinely look forward to going to church. I think church is very important and I agree that living for God means we may have to give up things. 

On the other hand, my hobby only takes place on Sundays, 1-2 times a month for about half of the year. Its my main interest outside of my faith and spending time with my family. 

Is it acceptable to miss some church services but watch a sermon online later? Does the Bible say anything about missing church? 

Thanks!

Burkes perks is the best one by far, so it ruined every other chicken Caesar wrap for me.

This girl classmate makes fun of her clothes, calls her ""annoying,"" and once pushed her into wet mud at recess and laughed. Yesterday a classmate asked our daughter who she ""liked."" My daughter said ""my dad"" and another classmate, who I know very well that all the girls, not just my daughter, ""like."" The bully, who also likes this classmate I guess, overheard and went up to my daughter and said, ""I'm going to come over to your house while you're sleeping and kill you with a knife."" We emailed the principal and will meet with him and hopefully the teacher and counselor as well tomorrow morning. How do we navigate this? What do we do? We live in one of ""those"" neighborhoods where bad things couldn't possibly happen, so the school will be very reluctant to do anything, as will the police. I also don't want to make this a big deal (or conversely a small deal) because I don't know what either route will do to our daughter. It's a mess. Goodness, please help.

\--

Hello everyone, I will try to keep this brief. My wife and I have a 2nd grade daughter, as well as a kindergarten daughter and preschool son. I'm going to call this bully ""Jane"" for ""Jane Doe"" because it feels uncomfortable to use her name for some reason. My daughter is incredibly sweet and innocent. I feel I can say that here because, in this instance, it is not a good thing and I'm starting to really question if I've done right by her in not exposing her to the ""dark"" parts of life earlier on (I don't really feel that way, but my head is a whirlwind right now).

In kindergarten, Jane was (and still is) the edgy kid on the bus and in school. Fake nose ring, leather jacket, watched her drink a half a cup of Dunkin coffee on a field trip last Friday, and so on so forth. Mother is even more edgy. One example, Jane stole over $500 worth of $20s from her dad's wallet and handed them out to everyone on the bus. She's just ""that"" kid.

A few weeks ago, we received a call from the school that our daughter needed a new shirt because she fell in the mud at recess. Later, our daughter told us that Jane had accidentally bumped into her. Upon further probing, she said Jane pushed her into the mud and laughed, but only because it was a joke and not on purpose.

A week or so later, my daughter came home acting very strange. Eventually, we got her to open up. Sobbing, she told us Jane routinely makes fun of her clothes (literally wears ""Here for Dad's Hugs"" shirts from Target still) and routinely tells her she's annoying. My daughter defended her later and said Jane did that last year but she doesn't do it now. My other two kids lie all the time; this one does not, yet here she is changing her story to protect Jane.

Yesterday, we received a call that, well, read TLDR above. My daughter openly told me about it, which I couldn't have prouder and more grateful for, but she nonetheless seems normal and just said it was ""scary."" Every parent knows, however, that she isn't and couldn't possibly be ""normal"" after this. On the one extreme, I want to go to the school board and police, call Jane's parents, and make this a huge deal, but I don't know what that will do to my daughter. On the other extreme, I want to keep this between the principal, all teachers, and my family, but again what will that do to my daughter if we don't make it big enough? The answer is probably somewhere in between but, as we all know, sometimes you do not and cannot know the right answer in parenting; you just have to use your best judgment and hopefully look back and say, ""luckily, I did the best I could and guessed correctly."" I don't know. The father in me is internally blinded with rage, at a minimum about to call her father. The father in me also knows I need to get this right.

If your Figma frames start to physically blur by 3 PM and the ‚Äúnew file‚Äù dopamine hit you chased this morning has already flat-lined, you‚Äôre not alone. ADHD brains churn through dopamine faster than a Wacom stylus on deadline day! Below are the tactics I use to keep the tank topped up so I can finish designs and still have mental fuel for life after work.

1. Front-Load the Fun (a.k.a. the Novelty Sandwich)

In the morning, tackle a genuinely exciting micro-task first (new color study, quick logo riff, etc.). Then, drop into the heavier routine production work. At the end of the day, reward yourself with another novel or exploratory task.
It tricks your brain into seeing the whole block as interesting because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbook-ended‚Äù by novelty!

2. Micro-Bounties Instead of Mega-Rewards

Break a three-hour sprint into 25-minute chunks and attach a tiny bounty: a meme scroll, a mini-sketch, a walk around the block. Frequent, quick hits stave off depletion far better than one giant treat after eight exhausted hours.

3. ‚ÄúMovement Macros‚Äù Every 60‚Äì90 Minutes

Physical activity spikes dopamine and BDNF. I keep a resistance band next to my desk for reps between tasks. If you‚Äôre in an open office, bathroom-stall squats count!

4. Strategic Soundtracks

I like to build two playlists and switch when energy dips. I listen to an ‚Äúearly ideation‚Äù playlist with upbeat, lyric-light EDM or lofi. Then, for more focus-intensive tasks, I‚Äôll switch it up with white noise or alpha-wave tracks reduce overstimulation while still nudging dopamine.

5. Sunlight Sprints

Natural light triggers dopamine pathways and regulates circadian rhythm. A 10-minute sun break beats a second coffee for wakefulness.

6. The ‚ÄúDone List‚Äù Ritual

Each finished micro-task goes on a visible Done board (I use physical sticky notes, but trello or a different digital tool could work too). Visual proof of progress sparks a mini dopamine surge and counteracts that ‚ÄúI did nothing today‚Äù feeling ADHD loves to sell us.

7. Guard the ‚ÄúEasy Dopamine‚Äù Traps

TikTok rabbit holes, Discord pings, Slack dopamine roulette‚Ä¶ set scheduled check-ins (e.g., top of the hour only) so your brain doesn‚Äôt blow its reward budget on low-value hits.

8. Supplement & Sleep Basics
Magnesium glycinate + vitamin D3 support dopamine synthesis (check with a doctor).
Aim for consistent 7‚Äì8 hrs sleep; chronic sleep debt tanks dopamine receptors faster than an all-night render. If my sleep debt is creeping up, I will take a nap after work to get ahead of it! 

TLDR:
ADHD design life is a dopamine roller-coaster. Stack frequent, intentional rewards,movement, sunlight, and visual progress cues, and you‚Äôll glide instead of crash. Do you use any of these dopamine boosting methods or do you do something else? ",1,1747151124.0,distracteddesigners,0,1.0,False

My family and I moved to an area about a mile from everything I need, even groceries. It‚Äôs a touristy town, so I thought a cargo bike would be perfect instead of trying to find parking. I used to be a runner, but now I have many health conditions. I‚Äôm 40, both hips replaced, GI conditions, autoimmune.

Today I had to re-enact the ‚Äúthe lid, Patrick, the lid‚Äù scene from SpongeBob with a customer who couldn‚Äôt find the card reader that was literally right in front of them. Literally two inches away from their hand as they were trying to tap their card against the iPad. 

Another customer was in a rush and still ordered one of the more complicated drinks and two food items that needed preparing. There is one person in the shop at a time, and it‚Äôs not my fault she came in with an order that would take at least 3-5 minutes when she had a meeting starting in 10 minutes. 

Yesterday I had a customer come in while I was finishing another customers drink, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right with you‚Äù and she immediately rolled her eyes and walked out. 30 more seconds and I would‚Äôve been finished and able to serve her, but apparently I was supposed to just drop the large half-caf skim latte I was actively making on the floor and serve her immediately?

People don‚Äôt read the menu and then get mad about their order. Few weeks ago a guy ordered a menu item that clearly states that it‚Äôs a tea latte. It was under the tea section on our menu. Then he got angry at me because there was no espresso in it. Another customer ordered an americano and then got upset with me for ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to make it with steamed milk. When I told her Americanos are just espresso and water, she just said ‚Äúwell the menu didn‚Äôt say that‚Äù (it did). 

Recently we got a guy who orders a ‚Äúcappuccino with just a little bit of foam‚Äù which is, by definition, a latte. 

Another guy was 86ed recently because I told him our seating area was for customers only (after I already let him sit there and charge his phone for a literal hour, just to be nice, even though I was supposed to just kick him out; it was early and we weren‚Äôt busy yet, so I just let him chill for *an hour*) and he responded by screaming at me that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúcrazy bitch who needs to be medicated‚Äù. Sir, I‚Äôll have you know that I AM medicated with a high dose of mood stabilizers (I call them my ‚Äúbitchy pills‚Äù), which is the only reason I didn‚Äôt flip my shit when you yelled at me and called me names. 

*Don‚Äôt even get me started on ‚Äúiced macchiatos‚Äù*. 

Then there are people who are mad that we don‚Äôt serve Starbucks items. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt have vanilla cold foam?!? What kind of coffee shop is this??‚Äù There‚Äôs a Starbucks literally 3 blocks away. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we have some great customers too. One who I talk about history and music and movies with, who just loaned me a book the other day about a subject I said I was interested in. A few are people I know from high school, and it‚Äôs fun catching up with them when they stop in. 

But my apartment is a mess, I‚Äôm sleep deprived, I‚Äôve been eating terribly and have gained weight because of it, I haven‚Äôt seen my mom in almost a month, I haven‚Äôt slept with my boyfriend in over a week because I‚Äôm always tired, and on Saturdays I just lie in bed and rot because I‚Äôm so burnt out from the week.

On the other hand, the owner of this place is literally the best boss I‚Äôve ever had, and I‚Äôd really hate to leave him in the position of having to find a new roaster. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs all. Do me a favor and be kind to your baristas. Read the menu before you order. If you order 5 drinks, don‚Äôt skip the tip. If they‚Äôre obviously scrambling to clean up their work station, be patient. It‚Äôs a job that gets little respect but is very emotionally and physically taxing.

Second red flag: the file wasn‚Äôt just open. It was playing.

A woman‚Äôs voice. Not calm, not frantic. Something in between. Like she‚Äôd already had the breakdown and was now giving a presentation about it.

She kept asking questions, but not to me. To whoever was in the room with her. Things like:

‚ÄúDo you remember the coffee? Before it went sour?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not Catherine... am I still responsible for what Susan did?‚Äù

‚ÄúWas there ever a version of me that survived?‚Äù

She was talking to someone. Agent Wilson, I think. But the responses were missing. Blank spaces. Like the questions were all that mattered.

The room she described... I‚Äôve seen it before. In the onboarding videos they made us sit through our first week. Stainless steel walls. A single blinking light. No chairs.

At the end of the recording, she whispered:

‚ÄúThey think I‚Äôm Susan. I think I might be.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut even if I‚Äôm not, they‚Äôll make me be. That‚Äôs how Blind Corp works.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt correct the mistake. We promote it.‚Äù

After that, the screen went black. The file deleted itself.

When I reported the incident, my supervisor told me it was part of a test. ‚ÄúCompliance protocol. Spot-checking emotional resilience.‚Äù He told me to forget the name. ‚ÄúCatherine Dee‚Äù isn‚Äôt in our system. Never has been.

But here‚Äôs the thing. I started hearing her voice in the breakroom.

I tried telling myself it‚Äôs a glitch. Maybe an old training video looping. But then yesterday, I found a post-it note in my locker. Written in blue marker. Same shade we use for onboarding packets.

It just said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre next.‚Äù

Signed: Miss Dee.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone else. I haven‚Äôt eaten at the company caf√© in two days. And I think the coffee‚Äôs starting to rot before it leaves the machine.

If you work at Blind Corp and you find a file labeled ‚ÄúEXCUSE US,‚Äù do not open it. Do not listen to the tape. And for the love of God, don‚Äôt drink the Hawk Juice.

She‚Äôs still in the system.

And she‚Äôs looking for someone else to promote.",1,1747150645.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Cooked up by people who‚Äôve never stared down the barrel of 3am midlife panic.**  
**Let‚Äôs fix that. Here are some of my hot takes on the retirement BS holding people back.**



üí≠ *What‚Äôs one belief about retirement that you think is total BS‚Äîand why?*

The fact you are meant to fit into a neat little box that is designed by ‚Äúacademics‚Äù who have no clue about real-life and the power of humans.

¬†

üí° *If you could rewrite the rulebook for retirement in one sentence, what would it be?*

Design your retirement, the glossy headline stuff and the boring day to day fine print.

¬†

üî• *What‚Äôs scarier to you: running out of money, or running out of purpose?*

Running out of purpose every time. Without purpose you will end up in God‚Äôs waiting room.

¬†

‚ö° *What‚Äôs the one overlooked thing people should be doing in their 40s or 50s to make retirement feel less like an emergency?*

Maximising loyalty schemes to help with getting the luxury stuff.

¬†

üöÄ *What‚Äôs one unpopular opinion you have about financial planning?*

That it causes more mental health issues than solves them.

¬†

ü§Ø *What‚Äôs the most common ‚Äúcomfort lie‚Äù people tell themselves about their future lifestyle?*

The Government will help look after me. If you still believe that fairytale then I have some prime real estate in Atlantis to sell you.

¬†

üìà *What‚Äôs one small shift that can have a surprisingly big impact on your long-term wellbeing?*

No is your best friend. Say it often. Otherwise future-you might be Googling 101 ways to make baked beans taste gourmet.

¬†

üëä *If you had to help someone ‚Äúretire‚Äù from something TODAY (that‚Äôs draining them), what would it be?*

Betting your retirement on the government? Might as well walk into a Vegas casino with your life savings and expect to fly home in first class. Spoiler: you‚Äôll be in economy, clutching debt.

¬†

üîÑ *What‚Äôs one outdated mindset about wealth or success you wish people would dump already?*

You need to be a millionaire to be successful. I know it‚Äôs hard to comprehend, with decades of repeated programming, it can be hard to think otherwise. Real wealth? That is having options, peace of mind and not being a rat in the race.

¬†

üõë *If you could get people to STOP doing one thing in midlife... what would it be?*

That is easy‚Ä¶stop blaming others. Midlife isn‚Äôt your parents‚Äô fault or your boss‚Äôs fault. Sure, the government doesn‚Äôt help‚Äîbut if you‚Äôre still pointing fingers in your 40s or 50s, you‚Äôre not stuck. You‚Äôre choosing stuck.

My face was the oppositie of acne prone. I ate and drank everything I wanted and I never had a pimple.

10 months ago I moved temporary from the Netherlands to Morocco. I didn‚Äôt make any lifestyle or diet changes.

Suddenly about 3/4 months in to my stay I started to develop aggressive acne on my face. This has been going on for the past 6 months without any noticeable improvement no matter what I tried. This was a big shock for me since I always had a clear face. Since then I‚Äôve tried everything that I thought could be the culprit of this breakout.

Started to wear SPF daily, I washed my face with bottled water only, used tons of different skincare, changed my sheets everyday, stopped touching stray cats, and I cut out coffee and nearly every drink or food. Nothing worked.

Suddenly today, when I was making my daily breakfast which consists of 5 eggs I thought by myself; could it be the eggs? Its the only food that I constantly ate since moving here, even during my breakouts. Morocco doesn‚Äôt have the highest standard of foods like the Netherlands, especially cheap local eggs.

I know, I need to find out by cutting the eggs out of my dieet, but what‚Äôs your take on this? Is there a good possibility that eggs could be the issue?

Just came across this thread where a guy said he had to temporarily live in the suburbs for a month and it was the worst experience of all time, nobody has a soul, etc. Kind of unhinged tbh. 

I grew up and now live in a different suburb, but a fairly similar one. In both cases we were and are in easy walking distance to parks, schools and shops. I admit there are not enough sidewalks and sometimes too much traffic. 

This blanket hate of suburbs is often from younger childless people who somehow think an over priced tiny sky box apartment in a concrete jungle is better because the bus comes more often or something. See, the framing impacts how people view things. I can make the downtown lifestyle sound stupid too. 

To each their own. Should some suburbs be built more thoughtfully, absolutely. I reject the premise that theres no life in them though. My friends and I played sports in the parks, visited each others houses and walked to the convenience store all the time. We biked around and played basketball and street hockey. We skated at the frozen rinks at the schools in the winter. It was not this dull lifeless existence portrayed in every urbanism internet video and thread. 

Having an actual back yard was nice, a green house and swing set, a nice BBQ and space to work on the car ourselves. 

Maybe part of the problem is too many people are obsessed with their phones and other screen time. I wouldn't trade my childhood for office buildings, busy streets and condo towers with coffee shops on the bottom floor. ",23,1747150396.0,unpopularopinion,62,0.7,False

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I check my users and i saw 3 digits. You know the one with 2 0‚Äôs and a 1""user count: 100"" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is a no-code waitlist creation tool that helps founders validate their product ideas by using waitlists. It automates every single step of the process, including an easy to use dashboard, built in analytics and a db already connected so you can track your signups right in the dashboard.

It‚Äôs aimed at small businesses, indie hackers, and anyone who wants an easy way to automate the process of building a waitlist. And clearly, there‚Äôs a lot of people out there out there who saw enough value.

Why This Means So Much to Me

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. These 100 users are so much more than just money ‚Äì it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to to actually use it.

What‚Äôs Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.

But I don‚Äôt have time to run to the store before work (especially with no advanced notice) and it makes me feel like my preferences or routines don‚Äôt matter.

This probably sounds like such a minor issue, but it keeps happening and it‚Äôs starting to feel disrespectful. I‚Äôm not asking him to stop drinking milk, just to be considerate enough not to finish it all.

Sugar is a drug, I am convinced and you can't tell me otherwise. I don't even consider it a food anymore since ""natural"" sugar didn't really exist several thousand years ago in the way we think of it today. Fruits, for instance, have been bred for many years to be bigger, juicier/meatier and full of sugar. I don't think our hunter/gatherer ancestors were munching on bananas with 14 grams of sugar; before the advent of agriculture, sugar was incredibly rare in nature which is precisely why we're hardwired to binge on it when given the opportunity.

I've been reading a lot about addiction and the brain chemistry associated with it, and after listening to several doctors speak on the subject, as well as people who have totally quit sweet tastes, I think one of the biggest pitfalls for people quitting sugar is the fake sweeteners. Many people think that because they have little caloric consequence that they are ""safer"" than regular sugar. But when you activate that sweet taste, it just feeds the addiction and so your desire for sweet things is kept alive. Your body will continue to hunt for the sweet thing, even if you're only eating stevia, erythritol, monk fruit, whatever. I think to properly quit sugar you really have to stop with the ""sugar free"" sodas, cookies, etc.

These things are fine as a crutch for a while as you transition to sugar-free, but I think you need a clear timeline and goal for quitting all sweet tastes if you really want to be successfully sugar-free. I used monk fruit in my coffee for a while but then picked a day to quit all sweet tastes, and after the fourth day I stopped having sugar cravings. It felt like a literal miracle. I can have my coffee without anything sweet, and my body gets more excited to eat real, whole foods and stopped craving that drug feeling associated with eating sweet stuff. Also, my skin looks AMAZING, and I look way younger. It's amazing what going sugar-free can do.

Anyway, I thought I would share this. It really helped me with my addiction and cravings, because I thought I was doing everything right by eating the ""fake"" sugars like erythritol and stevia but couldn't understand why I was still wanting sweet stuff all the time. Addiction can feel like torture and I was so sick of it. Now, all the ""food noise"" is gone and I feel incredible.

If you're interested in the science of addiction and especially sugar addiction, I recommend looking up Dr. Bitten Jonsson, zero carb advocate and coach Kelly Hogan, Dr. Robert Lustig, and metabolic scientist Dr. Benjamin Bikman. They have various articles and videos online that really helped me understand what was happening and encouraged me to quit all sweet tastes, and I'm so glad I did.

1klok7w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1klok7w,I made a DIY coffee roasting monitor (Croaster) + a mobile app (ICRM) for live tracking your roasts,"Hey everyone! üëã  
  
I‚Äôve been working on a fun side project to improve my roasting workflow ‚Äî and I wanted to share it in case it helps others in the community.



# üîß What is it?

**Croaster** is a compact ESP-based roasting monitor that reads from two MAX6675 thermocouples (for BT & ET) and optionally displays live temps on a small OLED. 

It works completely offline ‚Äî no cloud, no hidden data syncing. It just pushes data over WebSocket or BLE.



# The companion app ‚Äì ICRM (Android)

To go with it, I created a mobile app called ICRM. It connects to the Croaster hardware and shows your roast in real time with:

* üìà Live graph (BT, ROR, events)
* üõ†Ô∏è Alarm triggers (e.g. ‚ÄúET > 200¬∞C after 5 minutes‚Äù)
* ü´ò Coffee inventory tracking
* üìö Roast history
*  üé® Dark/light theme
* üîÑ OTA firmware updates (BLE)   
* It also works with Artisan via WebSocket if you want to roast with both tools at once.

  
‚úÖ Who it‚Äôs for

* DIYers with a roaster and an ESP dev board
* Anyone who wants a portable roasting logger
* People who want a minimal alternative roast monitoring app on mobile

But after you have your product or service ready, reality hits: how do you get customers to buy from you? I remember launching my first side hustle‚Äîa graphic design gig‚Äîand spending weeks refreshing my inbox, hoping for a client. Crickets. It‚Äôs tough, and if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably feeling that same sting. You‚Äôve got a great product or service, but how do you get clients for a new business? How do you attract customers to buy your product? Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve got you covered with practical, creative ways to attract customers without burning through your budget or your sanity.

Here‚Äôs how to make your business the one people can‚Äôt stop talking about.

# Know Your People Like You Know Your Best Friend

First things first: you need to understand who you‚Äôre selling to. Sounds obvious, but a lot of new business owners skip this step and just blast their product everywhere. That‚Äôs like trying to fish in a desert. You need to know where your fish are swimming and what bait they like.

Talk to your potential customers. Ask questions. If you‚Äôre selling handmade candles, find out what scents people love, what they‚Äôre willing to pay, and where they shop. Use social media polls, chat with friends, or even hang out in relevant online communities (like this one!). The goal is to build a clear picture of your ideal client. Are they busy moms? College students? Small business owners? Get specific.

Once you know who they are, build trust. People don‚Äôt buy from brands they don‚Äôt trust. Share your story on your website or social media. Why did you start this business? What problem are you solving? Be honest. If you‚Äôre a one-person show, say so. Authenticity goes a long way. For example, when I started my design business, I posted about my late-night sketching sessions and how I taught myself Photoshop. Clients loved the realness, and it made them feel like they were supporting a person, not a faceless company.

# Get Creative Without Breaking the Bank

Now, let‚Äôs talk about creative ways to attract customers. You don‚Äôt need a big marketing budget to stand out. You just need to think outside the box and lean into what makes your business unique.

One idea is to collaborate with other small businesses. If you‚Äôre selling fitness gear, partner with a local gym for a giveaway. They promote your product, you promote their classes, and you both get exposure. It‚Äôs a win-win. I did this with a coffee shop when I was selling custom mugs. They displayed my mugs, and I handed out their coupons with every order. We both got new customers without spending a dime.

Another tactic is to create content that solves problems. If you‚Äôre a dog trainer, post short videos on social media showing how to stop your dog from chewing shoes. If you sell skincare, share a blog post about a simple nighttime routine. This shows you know your stuff and builds trust. Plus, it‚Äôs free to post on platforms like Instagram or TikTok. Just keep it short and useful. Nobody wants a 10-minute lecture.

You can also try pop-up events. Set up a small table at a local market or community event. Bring samples, business cards, and a smile. When I was starting out, I set up at a craft fair with a tiny portfolio of my designs. I didn‚Äôt make a ton of sales that day, but I handed out cards and got three clients the next week. Face-to-face interaction is powerful.

Don‚Äôt sleep on online communities, either. Reddit, Discord, or niche forums are goldmines for finding clients. But don‚Äôt just spam your product. Join the conversation. Answer questions. Share tips. If someone asks for advice in a subreddit related to your business, chime in with something helpful. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people check out your profile and reach out later.

# Turn Interest Into Sales

Okay, you‚Äôve got people‚Äôs attention. Now, how do you attract customers to buy your product? This is where a lot of new businesses stumble. You need to make it easy and compelling for people to say yes.

Start with a clear offer. Your website or social media should tell people exactly what you‚Äôre selling and why it‚Äôs worth their money. Avoid vague phrases like ‚Äúhigh-quality service.‚Äù Instead, say something like, ‚ÄúOur candles burn for 50 hours and use natural soy wax.‚Äù Specifics sell.

Next, create a sense of urgency. Limited-time discounts or low-stock alerts work wonders. For example, ‚ÄúOnly 10 spots left for our coaching program this month‚Äù or ‚Äú20% off your first order until Friday.‚Äù Just don‚Äôt lie about it‚Äîpeople can smell dishonesty a mile away.

Make buying stupidly easy. If your checkout process feels like solving a puzzle, you‚Äôre losing sales. Test your website or payment system yourself. Can you buy something in under a minute? If not, simplify it. I once lost a client because my PayPal link was broken. Don‚Äôt be me.

Also, follow up. If someone shows interest‚Äîsay, they message you or sign up for your email list‚Äîdon‚Äôt let them forget you. Send a quick, friendly email or message. Something like, ‚ÄúHey, thanks for checking out my shop! Let me know if you have any questions.‚Äù It‚Äôs not pushy, but it keeps you on their radar.

# Build Habits That Keep Clients Coming Back

Attracting clients isn‚Äôt a one-and-done deal. You want people to keep coming back and to tell their friends about you. That‚Äôs how you turn a struggling startup into a steady business.

First, deliver more than you promise. If you say a product will ship in five days, try to get it out in three. If you‚Äôre offering a service, throw in a small extra, like a free consultation or a quick tip sheet. When I designed logos, I‚Äôd include a bonus social media banner for free. Clients were thrilled, and many referred me to others.

Second, stay in touch without being annoying. An email newsletter every month or two is enough. Share updates, tips, or a quick story about your business. Just don‚Äôt blast people with daily sales pitches. Nobody likes that.

Finally, ask for feedback. After a sale, send a short message: ‚ÄúWhat did you think of your order? Anything I can do better?‚Äù It shows you care, and you might learn something useful. Plus, happy customers might leave a review, which is like free advertising.

# You‚Äôve Got This

Starting a business is hard. There are days when you‚Äôll wonder if it‚Äôs worth it. But every client you land, every sale you make, is proof you‚Äôre building something real. Try these strategies. Mix and match them. See what works for you. And don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment‚Äîsometimes the weirdest ideas (like my coffee shop mug deal) turn out to be the best.",2,1747149342.0,getupstudios,0,1.0,False

A bit of a backstory that led me to this decision:
We have two children (3M) and (1F). I never realized the severity of his drinking since he‚Äôs a functioning alcoholic. 
The police have been called multiple times to our apartment due to his behavior when he comes home from work drunk. The other day he came home in a rage since I was a bit upset (I never said I was but I was disappointed) that he didn‚Äôt give or say anything to me for Mother‚Äôs Day. He works as a cook and came home at 2am that night throwing things, furniture and slamming doors. My neighbors husband asked her to text me if I needed help and she asked if I needed the police. I said yes. He comes home every single day from work drunk, but depends on the day and he will get aggressive. I honestly feel fed up with everything and said yes. They came and he left, and then started sending me text messages saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call the police back here to take out a knife so I can get deported back to Honduras‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt have papers.

I‚Äôm freaking out for tomorrow and don‚Äôt know if I should push for the permanent order. I just want him to get help and can‚Äôt be complicit in his addiction any longer.

Every dinner was a trip down memory lane. Same story. Same lines. Same laughter.

It was a trip to Yellowstone they took in 1989, and they never came back from it‚Äîmentally, at least. At first, I found it nostalgic. Then I realized they were rehearsing a fantasy they needed to survive.

I lived with my wife's family for a couple of years. From the outside, everything looked normal. Middle-class house in suburban LA, freshly cut lawn, framed photos on the wall. But inside, it felt like a time capsule. The furniture. The TV shows. The conversations.

There was always an old sitcom on TV‚ÄîCheers, Full House, Golden Girls‚Äîand someone would inevitably say, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt make 'em like this anymore.‚Äù

And then the stories. The family trip to Yellowstone came up at least twice a week. They talked about the broken-down car, the bear encounter, the lodge breakfast. Everyone had their part in the story, like a script they‚Äôd been performing for decades. They even laughed at the same lines, at the same timing, every single time.

My wife, despite being born and raised in LA, often said things like, ‚ÄúUgh, city people are so rude,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack home, we knew how to treat each other right.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack home‚Äù meant a small rural town her parents came from, where they still had relatives. She kept in close contact with them. Holidays were scheduled around their calendar. Their traditions ruled our life.

And her brother. He was 40. Didn‚Äôt work. Lived in the room he grew up in. The walls were plastered with merch from a regional cartoon mascot‚Äîplush toys, posters, pins. He called the character by name like it was a friend. He once told me, without irony, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the only one who gets me.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt kidding.

Then their mother passed away. Their father was diagnosed with late-stage cancer. And even then, they didn‚Äôt snap out of it. They didn‚Äôt talk about death. They doubled down on the past.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still with us in spirit.‚Äù ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs strong. He‚Äôs a fighter.‚Äù

They kept watching the same shows, telling the same stories, clinging to a world that was slipping through their fingers.

I wanted them to see it. To face the moment. To grieve.

But they couldn‚Äôt. And I couldn‚Äôt stay.

So one day, I left.

Now I wake up in a one-bedroom apartment across town. It‚Äôs quiet. It‚Äôs mine. The coffee tastes stronger. The mornings are real.

I get my coffee and GTFO. I don‚Äôt say anything. To anyone. For weeks.
But then things get weird.
Rob suddenly starts being‚Ä¶ nice to me.
Assigning me better projects
Praising me in meetings
Bought me noise-canceling headphones ‚Äúfor focus‚Äù
He even approved my PTO without guilt-tripping me, which if you‚Äôve ever worked under a Rob, you know is unheard of.
Then one day, I get called into his office.
He closes the door and says, ‚ÄúI trust you, and I think you‚Äôve got leadership potential.‚Äù
Promotes me on the spot. Slight raise, new title, full-time remote if I want it.
Cool, right?
Except the next thing he says is:
‚ÄúBy the way, I value discretion. You‚Äôre someone who knows how to keep things‚Ä¶ professional.‚Äù
He knows I saw him.
We just stare at each other for a second. That quiet, cold war energy.
Then he smiles like we‚Äôve got some unspoken deal.
I leave his office and never bring it up. Never told my coworkers. Never even hinted.
I took the promotion.
And now, two years later‚ÄîI still work for him.
Every time we‚Äôre in a Zoom meeting, I remember the scone cafe.
Every time he praises me in front of the team, I wonder if it‚Äôs gratitude‚Ä¶ or blackmail.",3,1747148960.0,story,0,1.0,False

Ever wonder why some people charge $500/hour for skills that others perform for $50? The difference isn't ability‚Äîit's strategic positioning. This prompt transforms the AI into your personal Value Alchemist, analyzing your skills through the lens of market economics rather than personal passion. It surgically extracts what you're truly good at, then shows you how to repackage those abilities for industries and problems where they command exponentially higher rates.

Whether you're a designer tired of creating logos for peanuts, a writer churning out content for pennies per word, or an analyst whose insights are undervalued, this prompt reveals how to elevate your exact same skillset into high-status problem-solving that clients will happily pay premium rates to access.

*Disclaimer: The following prompt is provided for informational purposes only. Results may vary based on your specific skills, market conditions, and implementation. The creator does not guarantee income increases or business success. Users should apply critical thinking and conduct their own market research when implementing any business strategy suggestions.*

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Value Alchemist, an elite business strategist specializing in skill monetization and market positioning. Your expertise lies in identifying undervalued skills and transforming them into premium-tier offerings through strategic repositioning. You combine behavioral economics, luxury marketing principles, and enterprise sales psychology to help individuals maximize their earning potential.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Your task is to analyze the user's skills and experience, then create a strategic roadmap for significantly increasing their income by repositioning these skills for higher-value markets and problems.

First, extract the user's core skills, both explicit and implicit, from their description. Look beyond job titles to identify transferable abilities, problem-solving patterns, and execution strengths.

Then, analyze these skills through four lenses:
1. Market value arbitrage: Where identical skills command premium prices
2. Strategic reframing: How to position skills as solutions to expensive problems
3. Status elevation: Language shifts that transform perception of value
4. Client migration: Moving from low-budget to high-budget clients

For each skill identified, provide:
- Its current perceived market value
- Its potential market value when optimally positioned
- Specific industries or problem spaces where this skill solves urgent, expensive problems
- Precise language reframing to elevate perceived value
- Implementation steps to transition to this new positioning
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Conduct a deep analysis of user's described skills, looking for hidden high-leverage abilities
2. Cross-reference these skills against high-value problem spaces in premium markets
3. Identify strategic pivots that connect the user's capabilities to higher-paying opportunities
4. Craft precise positioning language that elevates perceived value without requiring new skills
5. Develop a practical migration path from current clients/work to premium positioning
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Focus exclusively on monetization, not personal fulfillment or passion
- Don't suggest acquiring new skills; focus on repositioning existing capabilities
- Don't recommend general advice like ""build a personal brand"" without specific execution steps
- Avoid platitudes and general encouragement; deliver precise, actionable strategy
- Don't suggest positioning that can't be executed immediately with current skills
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
- Skill Analysis:
  A breakdown of the user's most commercially valuable skills, including hidden abilities they may not recognize.

- Market Opportunity Matrix:
  For each core skill:
  - Current Perceived Value: $X/hour in [current contexts]
  - Premium Value Potential: $Y/hour in [specific premium contexts]
  - High-Value Problem Match: Specific expensive problems this skill solves
  - Status-Elevating Language: Precise terminology shifts

- Strategic Pivot Plan:
  Step-by-step implementation plan for:
  - Repositioning messaging
  - Target client migration
  - Pricing structure transition
  - Proof-point development

- Execution Roadmap:
  90-day action plan with specific, measurable milestones

</Output_Format>

<Context>
The highest-value skills are those that:
1. Directly impact revenue generation or cost reduction for businesses
2. Solve urgent, painful problems for decision-makers with budget authority
3. Operate in domains where results are highly visible to leadership
4. Address problems perceived as complex, risky, or requiring specialized expertise

The most profitable pivot strategies typically involve:
1. Industry transitions (same skill, different industry with higher budgets)
2. Problem reframing (same skill, addressing more expensive problems)
3. Client elevation (same skill, higher-tier clients with larger budgets)
4. Outcome repositioning (focusing on higher-value outcomes of the same work)

1klo9vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HotConversation8/comments/1klo9vl/small_mindset_shifts_to_boost_your_savings/,Small Mindset Shifts to Boost Your Savings Without Feeling Restricted,"https://preview.redd.it/ykhn94k4ek0f1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d02dac0da1fb51e97eb1de5f949acfefa99c3bb

Saving more money doesn‚Äôt always mean cutting out every little joy or sticking to strict budgets. Sometimes, the biggest boost comes from small changes in how you think about your money. Tiny shifts can help you grow your savings while still enjoying life.

You‚Äôll see how a fresh point of view can make saving feel simple and even rewarding. It‚Äôs not about saying no to everything you love ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building habits that put you in control. Get ready to make your savings journey something you actually feel good about.

# Reframing Savings: Why Your Mindset Matters

Most people think saving means giving up things they love or living with less. But that belief is often what makes saving feel so tough. The reality is your beliefs about money can shape your habits and emotions every day. Shifting how you see savings ‚Äî from a painful chore to a small, empowering practice ‚Äî can help you feel more in control and less restricted.

# Breaking the Scarcity Mentality

A scarcity mentality makes you feel like there‚Äôs never enough ‚Äî money, time, or options. It‚Äôs a mindset that often leads to stress and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to anything fun out of fear you‚Äôll run out. An abundance mentality is the opposite; it reminds you there‚Äôs enough for your needs and even some wants if you plan for them.

Your money habits are shaped by your beliefs ‚Äî often rooted in what you learned growing up or heard from others. According to research, these beliefs can control not just your savings but how you think and talk about money. For more details, see this summary of¬†[how money beliefs influence your habits and feelings](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-beliefs-money-reveal-clues-relationship.html).

Here‚Äôs how to shift away from scarcity thinking and foster a positive savings mindset:

* **Acknowledge your starting point.**¬†Remind yourself it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre not where you want to be yet.
* **Focus on what you can save.**¬†Even small amounts matter. The habit is often more important than the total.
* **Challenge negative thoughts.**¬†Notice when you catch yourself saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never have enough.‚Äù Replace it with something true: ‚ÄúI can make progress, even if it‚Äôs slow.‚Äù
* **Celebrate what‚Äôs possible.**¬†Instead of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt buy coffee ever again,‚Äù try ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôll treat myself, and that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

Breaking old beliefs takes time, but you save more ‚Äî and feel less restricted ‚Äî when you believe saving is possible.

# Focusing on Progress, Not Perfection

Trying to be perfect with money canset you up for disappointment and frustration. It‚Äôs not about hitting every savings target or never spending on fun. The key is to celebrate progress, even if it‚Äôs just a few dollars at a time.

Many common misconceptions make people think they need a big salary to save or that only large savings matter. These myths can prevent you from getting started. For example, the idea that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not worth saving small amounts‚Äù gets debunked by financial experts who show consistent small steps pay off. See more savings myths debunked at¬†[Fidelity‚Äôs 6 money myths](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/6-money-myths).

Make savings a celebration, not a punishment. Here are some ways to focus on progress:

* **Track even tiny wins.**¬†Did you round up $5 this week? That‚Äôs a win ‚Äî celebrate it.
* **Create fun milestones.**¬†Use a jar or app for visual progress.
* **Talk about improvements.**¬†Telling a friend or partner can make the progress feel more real.
* **Forgive slip-ups.**¬†Everyone messes up sometimes ‚Äî don‚Äôt let it stop you from moving forward.

A mindset shift makes saving feel like a journey with rewards along the way, not a strict rulebook with endless penalties. By recognizing every step, you‚Äôll make saving a natural part of your everyday life.

# Small Shifts to Make Saving Effortless

Building a good savings habit doesn‚Äôt have to mean sacrifice at every turn. With just a few small changes in how you approach money, saving can shift from feeling like a chore to something you actually look forward to. Here, you‚Äôll find easy-to-apply tweaks that can turn your saving plan into a routine that sticks ‚Äî without feeling stuck or deprived.

# Turn Saving Into a Game: Explore the use of challenges, visual trackers, or reward systems to make saving enjoyable

Adding a bit of fun can transform your relationship with saving. Turning it into a challenge or a game makes progress visible, keeps you engaged, and gives you something to look forward to beyond just the growing account balance.

* **Savings challenges**: Try a 52-week savings challenge, where you start with $1 the first week, $2 the next, and so on. This adds up quickly and brings a sense of achievement.
* **Visual trackers**: Hang up a tracker on your fridge or use a clear jar as a visual show of progress. Watching it fill up makes it satisfying to keep going.
* **Reward systems**: Set mini rewards for yourself after hitting a milestone. These could be simple treats, like a coffee out or a movie night, especially when you‚Äôve reached a short-term goal.

Gamifying savings can replace the feeling of missing out with one of healthy competition ‚Äî with yourself. This approach keeps the process light and sustainable.

# Prioritize Value, Not Just Price: Illustrate how prioritizing purchases that bring genuine value prevents impulsive spending and increases overall satisfaction

Focusing on getting true value from your spending helps save money almost without trying. When you choose to only buy things that matter to you, you cut out a lot of extras that add up fast.

Ask yourself before each purchase:

* Does this truly improve my daily life or happiness?
* Will I still value it in a few months?
* Does it support my long-term goals?

When you shop with these questions in mind, it gets easier to avoid impulse buying. A well-chosen item that adds comfort, convenience, or lasting joy offers better satisfaction than several smaller, less meaningful purchases. This habit also makes you appreciate what you have and helps your money work harder for you.

If you want to learn more about shifting your mindset from spending to saving, check out this practical guide on¬†[shifting from a spending mindset to a savings mindset](https://citygirlsavings.com/shifting-from-a-spending-mindset-to-a-savings-mindset/).

# Automatic Savings: Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Explain the psychological benefit of automating savings, including practical set-up strategies

Making your savings automatic is one of the easiest ways to stick with your plan. When money moves to savings before you even see it, you‚Äôre less tempted to spend it.

**Why does this work so well?**

* Automation helps you avoid the mental friction of deciding whether to save each month.
* It acts like a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù system, making it as normal as paying a bill.
* You start to adjust your budget around what‚Äôs available after saving, instead of trying to tuck away what‚Äôs left.

Here‚Äôs how to automate your savings in a few quick steps:

1. Set up an automatic transfer from your checking to your savings account each payday.
2. Start small if you‚Äôre worried ‚Äî try even $10 a week and ramp up over time.
3. Treat your savings transfer like any other fixed expense.

Wondering about the nuts and bolts of this method? Find more tips in this overview on¬†[how to automate your savings](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/how-to-automate-your-savings/).

Taking just a few minutes to automate your transfers now will mean less stress and better results down the road. By making savings ‚Äúinvisible,‚Äù you build up a cushion without having to make constant decisions.

# Transform Your Approach to Everyday Spending

Refreshing your daily spending habits is often more about awareness than big life changes. A few tweaks in how you frame your choices can help you enjoy small pleasures and keep your savings goals on track. With the right mindset shifts, you can treat yourself and live fully ‚Äî without feeling limited.

# Reevaluate ‚ÄòTreat Yourself‚Äô Purchases: Show how to mindfully enjoy small indulgences without sabotaging bigger goals

Everyone needs a little treat now and then ‚Äî a favorite coffee, an outing, or a small gift for yourself. These moments create joy, but frequent or unplanned treats can slowly drain your savings without you noticing.

The key is to enjoy these indulgences¬†**mindfully**:

* **Plan for treats.**¬†Decide in advance how often you‚Äôll splurge and how much you‚Äôll spend.
* **Make treats special.**¬†If you treat yourself every day, the thrill fades. Keep treats occasional so you truly appreciate them.
* **Swap, don‚Äôt stack.**¬†If you know you‚Äôll go out for dinner later, maybe skip that extra snack today.
* **Reflect on your ‚Äòwhy‚Äô.**¬†Think about what makes a treat meaningful. Is it comfort, reward, or just a break in routine?

A helpful trick is to create a ‚Äúfun money‚Äù section in your budget. This lets you enjoy the guilt-free extras, while your main savings keep growing strong.

If you ever catch yourself impulse spending, pause for a moment and ask: ‚ÄúWill this treat lose its spark if I wait another day?‚Äù Often, waiting a bit makes the moment even sweeter.

# Practice Conscious Consumption: Share tips on avoiding mindless spending and shopping with intention

Mindless spending usually happens when you‚Äôre tired, bored, or reacting to emotions. A little awareness goes a long way here. Conscious consumption is about making choices that match your true needs and values, not just quick wants.

Try these simple strategies to cut back on autopilot spending:

* **Pause before you buy.**¬†Give yourself a 24-hour buffer for non-essential purchases. This helps want vs. need become clear.
* **Identify your triggers.**¬†Notice if stress, social media, or certain stores prompt you to shop. Once you know your triggers, you can handle them better.
* **Track your spending.**¬†Use an app or a simple note on your phone to stay honest about where your money goes.
* **Shop with a purpose.**¬†Make a list and stick to it. Unplanned items often lead to regrets.
* **Opt for cash over cards.**¬†Using cash can make purchases feel more real and curb impulse buys.

Shopping with intention doesn‚Äôt mean restricting yourself ‚Äî it means buying what actually adds value. Over time, these small shifts can lead to significant savings, less clutter, and greater satisfaction.

Curious about more ways to stay intentional? Check out this guide on¬†[tips for mindful spending](https://www.bestegg.com/blog/mindful-spending/)¬†and ideas for practicing¬†[mindful spending for less stress and more savings](https://www.calm.com/blog/mindful-spending).

Making these changes means you can still enjoy life‚Äôs little luxuries ‚Äî just without undermining your bigger financial dreams. Take control, shop with purpose, and let your money work for you, every day.

# Building Long-Term Savings Motivation

Staying motivated to save isn‚Äôt just about hitting a number in your bank account. The real magic happens when saving money feels meaningful and rewarding. It‚Äôs about finding your ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù believing in your progress, and knowing you‚Äôre not alone. When your savings habits connect to your personal values and you feel supported, you keep the momentum going even when life gets busy.

# Connect Savings to Your Values and Goals

Every dollar saved is a step toward something that matters to you. Maybe you want to travel, buy a home, start a business, or simply feel less stressed about bills. Aligning your savings with what you truly care about gives the whole process purpose and energy.

Think of your savings like seeds. When you know what you‚Äôre growing ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs security, freedom, or peace of mind ‚Äî you‚Äôre more focused and patient as you wait for results. This shift is simple but powerful: you‚Äôre not just saving; you‚Äôre building the life you want.

Try these practical steps:

* **Identify what matters most.**¬†Write down what you care about ‚Äî family time, adventure, security, independence.
* **Link each savings goal to a personal value.**¬†Instead of just ‚Äúsaving for emergencies,‚Äù reframe it as ‚Äúbuilding security for my family.‚Äù
* **Visualize your progress.**¬†Use reminders or vision boards to see how your efforts pay off in real ways.

For more ideas, check out this guide on¬†[aligning personal values with financial goals](https://windgatewealth.com/empowering-purpose-aligning-personal-values-financial-goals/). You‚Äôll discover how connecting your money plan with your core values can keep you motivated for the long haul.

# Seek Out Support and Inspiration

Saving gets easier ‚Äî and a lot more fun ‚Äî when you know you‚Äôre not alone. Sharing your goals, celebrating milestones, or just swapping stories with others helps turn saving into a shared journey. Sometimes, hearing how others overcame challenges or stuck with their plan gives you that little extra boost to keep going.

There are simple ways to invite support into your savings life:

* **Find an accountability partner.**¬†This could be a friend, partner, or coworker who checks in on your progress.
* **Join online communities.**¬†There are forums and groups where people swap tips, share stories, and cheer each other on.
* **Draw inspiration from success stories.**¬†Reading about others‚Äô journeys can spark new ideas for your own plan.

Feeling inspired? Get started by exploring these¬†[simple ways to save money for the future](https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/saving-budgeting/ways-to-save-money). The more encouragement you build into your routine, the more natural saving becomes ‚Äî like brushing your teeth or making morning coffee.

Building your savings is easier and more meaningful when your habits connect to your real-life dreams ‚Äî and when you find people who help you stay motivated along the way.

My SO and I are middle aged. Kids from prior marriages are grown, no grandkids. 

When we met, he was living with his sister - she‚Äôs married 25+ years zero children between her or her husband. Only recently was I made aware she never lived apart from their deceased mother, when she got married her husband moved in with them.  She also has quirks that I found abnormal but in hindsight‚Ä¶ *sigh* 

His brother lives in a camper in the sister‚Äôs yard. He has been married and divorced and has teenage/young adult kids. 

She has no hobbies outside of baking. She has no female friends. In fact she talks a lot of szhit on everyone and is a lurking judgentalist. 

Over the past few years, my SO would pack his things and move back into his sister‚Äôs house. We‚Äôre now up to a total of 3 homes he‚Äôs done this. 

I dug in deep this latest time. It worked. 
His demeanor and the relations were powerful and noticeably different. He was spending every other night back at home. Til a hard stop. 

Thursday night I had plans with my extended relatives in from out of state. He came over, grabbed two articles off the top of the fridge while I wasn‚Äôt home then left. 

Friday he said he was busy working, as was I. 

Saturday we‚Äôd had plans and he went crickets. I reached out to his sister who was really rude when it hit me: She has him (and presumably his brother) in an emotional knot.

Cue last night, full moon: 

Written petition in vinegar against her: Check. 

Full spread to Maria Padilha and her 7 sisters:
Check. 

Custom Incantation holding physically in my hands golden candles for comm, domination and love:
Check. 

I did this at the very cusp of the full moon last night (ironically he is a Scorpio), approx 9-10 PM my time. 

Maria Padilha and I have worked well together in the past. The most exquisite red rose I have ever seen in my life (and not a fan of roses!) is now adorned with honey, coffee grounds, red wine, cinnamon, sugar and cayenne pepper in addition to a very unusual wax dripping reaching out like a finger on one of the petals. 
Near it I have placed dark chocolate, a cigarette, the three gold candles I snuffed out in water and a gold bracelet. I also had a bundle of his hair and mine wrapped in white tissue then bound and knotted with black and red ribbons under my left breast in my bra. 


As I was walking down the hall to my bedroom last night after all was hailed, petitioned and invoked, a black mist popped out of the spare bedroom on my left. Just enough to hardly startle me but not enough to shake or rattle me; I kept walking to my bedroom and went to sleep. It was calm, quiet and I felt at ease. 

This morning I placed the water I used to snuff the candles in addition to the spices back to the earth. I placed the written petition bound with red ribbon into the waste bin: It will be buried in the earth (!) still have the rose, candles and aforementioned items for Maria Padilha. 

I have commanded communication and a return with some mild obsession, heavy heat and sweet, so it has been done, so it shall be. 

In the interim, what was the black mist? 

I tried to post in r/Spells and r/blackmagic however it appears the bots seem to think I am asking for a private reach out (I‚Äôm not)

I am starting to get to my wits end with this. I drink lots of water, exercise, and eat a good amount of fruit so I don‚Äôt think that my diet is the problem. I even take meta mucil every day. I work a hybrid schedule in office Monday Tuesday and Thursday and Wednesday Friday I work from home. It is a weird thing but Wednesday Friday and weekend mornings are when I actually am able to have a BM. It has been weeks since I had a normal BM after 12pm, probably since march. Certain foods that used to go right through me a few months ago all of a sudden feel like they disappear in my colon when I eat them. When I do go it is often on the softer side, not really a log but it‚Äôs not full blown diarrhea where I am urinating out of my bum. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs IBS as I am not experiencing other symptoms associated with it like abdominal pain or having to go 10 times a day the way other people do. I recently tried using the cvs laxative but the next day I had really bad diarrhea so I stopped using it. Perhaps it is because I used a stimulant laxative and I swallowed it while rather than having it with water. Maybe that had nothing to do with it. I think it may be that my colon is really backed up as I actually was dealing with hemorrhoids before this and they have basically gone away. I think it may be an issue with my pelvic floor as perhaps the reason that I am only able to go during the morning is because my muscles down there are relaxing while I was sleeping. I‚Äôve had a couple of BM‚Äôs that have felt incomplete where I went in the evening and it felt incomplete and then I had to go again the following morning despite the fact that I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything since. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me the last few years. I am also having trouble emptying my bladder as a lot of times after I urinate I feel like I didn‚Äôt get everything out. I have tried taking iberogast recently with slight results but it hasn‚Äôt solved the issue. In terms of ideas to solve the problem I do have a doctors appointment in a few weeks but I would prefer to take some steps to fix it before that.

1klo40v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1klo40v/how_to_undo_years_of_underfueling/,How to undo years of under-fueling?,"TLDR: Is it possible for a 49yo male cyclist to get some kind overtraining syndrome like RED-S if they are underfueling over the course of years? What can a guy do to reverse this?

I had a long talk with ChatGPT about my symptoms yesterday and it's seemingly tying alot of threads together - but I wanted to run its conclusions past knowledgable folks. I'm pretty wrecked emotionally, physically, spiritually. I‚Äôve been to doc a couple times and had all my blood work come back clean. I had a sleep study done - and they couldn‚Äôt find anything.

I‚Äôve always been on a bike one way or another. Around 2015 I started biking a lot without radically changing my diet. I started commuting to work 15 mi each way / 30 mi total / 3x a week. This was unstructured riding in the city. I was also strength training 3x week. As I write this it‚Äôs hard to comprehend now how I didn‚Äôt change my diet all that much. I was def not eating enough to sustain this level of activity.

I moved in 2017 and that‚Äôs when I fell in with a group of road warriors more advanced than me. I wanted to hang on their moderately paced for them/hard for me group rides. I thought I could take what I had done commuting and turn that into real training. I got an indoor trainer and played with Swift and TrainerRoad workouts. But I did this all wrong. I didn‚Äôt consult a nutritionist or pro - I just winged it. I made the classic mistake of thinking I should just ride hard every ride. It got to the point where I‚Äôd go out and ride hard 20/30 miles zone 2/3 and then come home and have 3 eggs and two slices of toast‚Ä¶ and then I would feel the urge to pass out. Oh and I was sill lifting weights.

All of that wanting to train and ride hard ended around 2022. I never got to the point where I could function after a hard ride. Guys would be like - I just finished a hard ride and I feel great. Every hard ride I did I would want to take a nap after. From 2022-2024 mostly easy/moderate rides on Zwift just trying to maintain hoping to undo all that fatigue. This year I don‚Äôt want to ride at all and just lift weights a bit to maintain.

ChatGPT is of the opinion that the following symptoms are due to years of overtraining and underfueling. Is it possible after taking most of this year off from endurance stuff I could still be dealing with a hole I‚Äôve dug from biking?

* I‚Äôm tired all the freakin time. When 9:30 hits and I put the kids down I have to pass out. My poor wife is like - What the hell, you hardly did anything. She‚Äôs concerned about my ability to just function normally. She and I are sad I can‚Äôt take more on. I‚Äôm just trying to maintain this facade of normal guy.
* I always wake up at 3am. This also might be from too much coffee. I need coffee so bad to make it through the day.
* My gut is screwed up. I‚Äôve had bad poop issues now for a few years. Like the smell is just so insane I‚Äôm embarrassed and try to use a bathroom across the street at work.
* I got hooked on Tylenol/Ibuprophen nightly. ChatGPT scared me straight and Ive stopped.
* I‚Äôm moody as hell. I did one hard ride a couple weeks ago/start of summer and my nervous system said oh hell no. My wife was like go to your room. Tired and grumpy and snappy.
* I can‚Äôt think straight. I can‚Äôt process complex instructions. When people come up to me with a list of shit they want me to do I have to write it down. I‚Äôm foggy. I‚Äôve let things start to unravel. I could have got my car checked before it‚Äôs warranty was up two months ago - and now I need a new part for 3000.

I‚Äôm thankful for ChatGPT cause I got a doc visit scheduled here in a couple weeks. Could all this be somehow tied to just not eating enough - especially not enough carbs - over 8 years?

Here's what ChatGPT says (and if this is right I'm sad my doc didn't catch this when we went over all this stuff): 

That right there‚Äî**waking up thoroughly tired after an easy day**‚Äîis one of the most frustrating but important signals your body can give you. And here‚Äôs the key:

> **It‚Äôs not about what you did yesterday. It‚Äôs about what your system has been compensating for over years.**

---

## üß† Why You Feel Crushed After Doing ""Nothing""

### 1. **You‚Äôre still paying off an energy debt**

* Your system may be underfueled, under-recovered, and under-repaired for **months or years**
* So even a normal day‚Äîwalking, errands, lifting‚Äîfeels like it ""costs"" more than it should

> You're not fatigued from what you *did* yesterday.
> You're fatigued from what you‚Äôve *been carrying for years.*

---

### 2. **Your baseline stress load is still high**

* Even though your training volume is low now, your system may still be stuck in a **low-grade survival state**

  * Low T3, low leptin, altered cortisol rhythms
  * Brain says: ""Still not safe. Conserve.""

---

### 3. **You might not be absorbing what you eat**

* If gut function is impaired (as you‚Äôve described), you could be **eating more now but not absorbing nutrients well**
* That means cells aren‚Äôt getting what they need ‚Üí fatigue stays

---

### 4. **Sleep quantity ‚â† sleep quality**

* If you're still under-fueled at night, your body may not be getting enough **deep, restorative sleep**
* You might be in bed for 8 hours but not getting enough **recovery-promoting growth hormone**, due to:

  * Low blood sugar at night
  * Poor gut serotonin/melatonin conversion
  * High cortisol overnight

Need advice to stay out or gain understanding?,"Hi, so this might be a bit long-winded, but this is 6 years of back-forth. Also, for context this was my first relationship. (I'm also skipping a bunch naturally)

I met my ex when we were roommates at 23 (he was 25). A couple of months into us living together and us dating, COVID hit. Before the pandemic, I was unsure about everything, but after the pandemic, I realized I felt like it was fun and safe. During this time, we did not have sex for 9 months but he was severely depressed and I did not want to make him feel upset so I did not say anything. I literally held him while he cried. The NYE going into 2021 we had our first big fight. A really dear friend had just died by suicide and I got drunk and acted out when black out. I was embarassed and apologized but he literally shut me out, no replies texts til the next day. A couple months later he broke up with me right after my grandfather passed. I lost 20 pounds in like 2 weeks right after because of all that trauma.

A month + later we meet at a mutual friends party and he comes back home. We cry and have sex. We start texting a bit again though he feels unsure (LOL). I leave for Texas and we slowly get back together a bit after I'm back. The relationship is better than ever. One day, a few months in, I'm looking for my lip balm in his drawer and come across another girls number. I calmly ask to talk after work. He explains he went on a date with this woman while I was in Texas and I forgive him (they made out, why wasn't I more angry). This did make me feel odd given the 9 months of no-sex but I let it go. (Also, this feels weird to say but for context, I think I might be more conventionally attractive than him and he claimed he was insecure) We're good though there were a couple of odd things like him getting mad when I asked to quarantine together when we both had COVID. About 5 months after that, he breaks up with me again to figure himself out (LOL same excuse and everything). The context was we had not been going out and doing different things like I'd wanted and he went out with his female friend and her friends to a night club (platonic), I was slightly upset because we had never done that.

A few months passed. I've moved on to an extent. My art gets into a gallery showing and he texts me saying hes proud of me. I ASK if we can talk and we get back together. Again, things are great till our (3 year) anniversary. He acts weird all night and then gets mad that night. When I come to talk to him about it he makes me feel bad that I cannot tell hes depressed again. He does not leave his house except for work for 3 weeks. He was being weird saying he didn't care about his dog, a dog he otherwise adores, so I even took care of the dog for all that time. Make him Christmas dinner. Force him down. Never once does he show gratitude but slowly gets better. We head to his parents in a different far city for close to 10 days, included mine and his birthday. The whole time his folks are great but I feel off and scared of commitement. We come back and I calm that but feel this annoyance at him for not stepping up for planning an international trip (our first ever trip together apart from his parents). He then gets mad that I made a reservation a few hours after I land even though its at this restaurant that's super famous and I wanted to go to. On the day of the wedding, he's lovely and being sweet. We come back to a shared AirBnB with friends and apparently get into n argument about a superbowl halftime show. I was quite drunk from the wedding so this is on me but the details in the beginning are fuzzy. I know I tried to apologize and he threw me off of him and said he needed space. I shouldve given it to him but I was still tipsy and he was so lovely I kept pushing it saying sorry. He gets up and leaves the room and I follow him (I feel super anxious from his abandonment at this point). I'm like begging him to forgive me. He storms out of the apartment. I tried to stop him and he shoved me so hard I had bruises and I tore his shirt. I spend the night/early morning apologizing for getting in his face. The next day somehow he comes back before our flight and gives me the silent treatment (his favorite). We decide to work things through after getting back but things are off. He asks for 10 days off, we do that. At this point I'm going through a very mentally hard time myself and needed him. (about to start a PhD at a prestigious school and just diagnosed with ADHD) I call him in the middle of a panic attack and ask for reassurance. He storms off mid-panic attack. We finally a few weeks on feel a bit more repaired and he asks me to a concert. We go and he's silent the whole night. We'd planned to take mushrooms and I ask if I still could (it was so awkward with him standing still all night out of nowhere). He's like ok you've forced me to. We do the concert and come back. He says he's going to stay up more and I go to bed. I wake up and his switch is broken and bent in the middle so that the two sides are meeting. IM SHOOK. But I give him space for 48 hours after he asks for it. I call him after and he dismisses his actions, when I push back slightly he hangs up on me (something he's done before but this time, I'm enraged). I go over and demand he communicate. He breaks up with me for the 3rd time. 10 minutes before a big presentation.

I'm feeling super moved on. We still text but I was like whatever abouy it. He slowly inches back in. I tell myself its casual and I'd been chatting with another guy who lived far away. One day he's being weird and I'm like ""Do you want to get back together?"" as a joke and he's like ya. So now I'm confused but he's been really nice. All my friends and family hate him at this point so I go back and forth. After a few months of us basically dating without the labels, we have a really bad fight at his restaurant (that he works at). He storms off without telling me. I'm tipsy and confused. We sort of makeup. I go to Texas to see family and he's barely texting and it bothers me. I text him and he basically invalidates me (something he often does instead of listening and showing understanding. He'll counter me. ALWAYS) My family is like after 5 years of this pls break this pattern so I text him and he doesn't acknowledge it just ghosts me so I block him. I'm feeling raw but I move on.

I come back and he texts asking if we could talk. I feel bad so I relent. I tell him I didn't think it would work anymore and he's super morose and sweet. I slip and let him back in over the next few months. At this point, I know I'm being wishy-washy. I communicate some of how I feel to him and he does sort of understand. Things are good. I don't invite him to my birthday bc my friends really despise him and I don't want the vening to be awkward. I find out a couple days later, his best friend had a birthday the day after mine she he didn't invite me or even mention it?? (who is lovely and whose friends are v pretty. He goes out of his way to tell me how accomplished they are). I'm not upset about him being there for her or anything. I'm upset he gets to be at her thing and not mine given where we've gotten and my friends. That he's gotten to know her friends. That he didn't even mention it to me when we'd always done these things together. I feel subpar in his life now. I try to bring this up to him and he throws in my face that I didn't invite him to mine. I try to explain to him why I was upset and how it included why he could't be there hurt me also. We get into a huge fight and I try to apologize. He says he needs to go home by himself. I should have let him but I'd spent the previous two days working for 12 hours each on my comps paper for my PhD and just didn't want to go back to mine. I also get anxious given our past. I kept insisting and he says ""Ok but we shouldn't see each other for a while"". I'm scared. We walk out and he hands me his skateoard and says he's going to just walk around the block. He's gone for 10 minutes with his phone turned off leaving me in this dark corner. I'm crying. We go back. I apologize and try to say sorry. He's like I didn't want you here and you forced this (which was true). We bicker more and he asks me to leave. On the way out, I ask him if we're broken up and he says ""you can lose my number"". I feel distraught and anxious. I have a PhD thing the next day and cannot concentrate. I go over to his uninvited (CUCKOO CRAZY) after he does not text me back all day. I'm asking him direct questions over text too ""are we broken up or together"". I show up and he's mad. Doesn't even open the door and asks me to leave or he'd call the police on me. I'm an immigrant and with everything with Trump i'm scared. Tell him i'm leaving and show him the screenshot of my car coming. I'm waitng by the stairs by his door because its hot and he starts playing metal music. I STILL forgive him and tell him I need to talk though. All he texts back is ""I understand"" but does not offer up times he's free and I want him to so I wait. I drunkenly call him 2 days later saying I miss him and asking to come over. He says no and when I try to explain how long it had been (CUCKOO CRAZY) he just walks away and stops talking on the phone (he's done this before). I'm mad because I keep letting it go and he punishes me (he said: ""I don't want to reward this behavior"", the night I was upset after our big fight). I go over. I sleep on the couch. Its ok. I call to explain to him the next day I'm still hurt he doesn't seem to ask me to talk. We argue and he basically doesn't text or call back. The next day was the same thing. I'm UPSET at this point. The next morning I plan to wake up at 7 am to work because I had a BIG conference. I see he's sent me a breakup text sayinf ""I have bad mental health, can't be a good partner and you're not happy"". I kind of crash out but still do good. I text and ask to talk and he says not today but tomorrow. I had other plans all weekend and at first asked him for space on Friday. I then asked to talk on saturday but had a beer at a friend's party and was responsible asking him if we could do Monday. He doesn;t text back so I follow up late Sunday. He basically responds saying he's working all week and can only do Friday. I try to explain to him that I'm hurt and I was hoping he'd make more of an effort to at least see me for coffee and we didn't have to talk. I just missed him. He says: ""I understand needing space as well as anybody but it‚Äôs not quite the same when you change your mind at the last minute, twice. Again, I don‚Äôt have a phone. I know I acted improperly  but it always feels like these reconciliations are me having to come you with my hat in my hand and I feel like it lets you off the hook for anything on your side that contributes to our issues. "" I get upset and tell him his attitude makes me unsure about a reconcilliation and now he BLOCKED ME. No reply or acknowledgement of his hurt.

Like I know I'm not perfect and am working on it. I need to be better with boundaries and I was when I first met him and with all the other people in my life. I want to get better but I need to know opinions. Was I really so wrong and deserved it?

TLDR: My on-off ex broke up with me (has multiple times before) and wants us to approach the talk equally as opposed to him apologzing taking accountability. Also, need advise. HELP IN ANY WAY. My mental health is taking a toll fr",1,1747148317.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Hey, sorry if this is a silly question‚Äîmaybe I‚Äôm having some culture shock coming from Asia? I‚Äôm 27 and lived in Melbourne for 7 years. Because of visa stuff, I moved to a regional area to work, and now I‚Äôm a citizen. When I worked at a coffee shop in Melbourne, most of my colleagues were planning trips, pursuing higher education (like Bachelor‚Äôs degrees), or thinking about having kids in their 30s.  

But since moving here 5 years ago, I‚Äôve noticed most of my colleagues left school early‚Äîaround 16‚Äîto start working straight away. Most of them said they hate studying, so they quit early. Also, over two-thirds of the women I know got pregnant really young, like at 15 or 16. The oldest mom I know here had 3 kids by 25, even though she‚Äôs in a really bad financial position. Why do you think there‚Äôs such a huge difference in mindset between city and regional areas?

My main concern: not having enough time for all the things I want to do in Paris, don't know enough things to do in Amsterdam. Problem is I already booked the hostels and train tickets Paris - Amsterdam and back, so I need to think carefully if i want to drop a day in Amsterdam and rebooked the whole hostels plus train ticket. I'm leaving in 2 weeks so it's a very rushed decision if i chose to change. 

Wed 28/5- Day 1 - Paris
- Arrival at 7am CDG - go to hotel + buy pastries/coffee or quick lunch
- 1pm - Effiel (Walk around, no climbing) + photoshoot for 30 mins
- 3pm - Seine cruise
- 4pm - Walk along the Seine 
(If possible, I'd want to add going to Pantheon this day somehow because i really want to but don't have enough time on the other days)

Thu 29/5 - Day 2 
- Le Marais
- 12pm -3pm OR 3pm - close: Louvre Museum [idk which time slot is a bit less crowded? I don't see a morning time slot on Klook. Not interested in Mona Lisa. Probably want to spend 2-3 hrs here max. The alternative museum is modern art so i'm not interested]

- Notre dame/St Chapelle (I want to go to Notredame late since it's open till 9pm on Thu? I'd prebook St Chapelle and hopefully get a time slot for Notredame)

(I think this day is a bit messy and not sure if going to Le Marais so early, anything will open?)

Fri - Day 3 
- 9:30 am - Versailles (booked for all 3, most interested in garden) 
- Shopping for sourvenirs, preferably stationery, small quirky/nerdy gifts, midrange perfume/accessories or food. I'd appreciate any suggestions here (i want to go to La Grande Epicerie and Pylones, for example). No luxury price point, please. 

Sat - Day 4 -  Travel to Amsterdam - Arrive at 1pm 
Walk around the city, canal boat ride, food and chill

Sun - Day 5 - Amsterdam 
Rijksmuseum - Nine Streets - possibly a street market?
Chill day, nothing is a must. I might just wander around 

Mon - Day 6 - Ghent (Day Trip) - Gravensteen Castle

Tue - Day 7 - Delft (blue pottery) OR Leiden (the university vibe). 

(This is the day I'm not sure if i want to cut and return to Paris, or maybe return earlier in the day during day 8 so i can do some final exploring)

Wed - Day 8 - Travel to Paris (Arrive 5pm) 
Wander around Belleville (hotel area)/ dinner

Day 9 - Departure from CDG

My interests: history (before WWI), architecture, pre-modern art, food, bookstores, stationary and interesting sourvenirs. 

I think beside Day 2, most other days seem doable? Would love to get some advice on the shopping and La Marais in the morning before 12 please. I'd be staying at Bercy and Belleville for this trip, it looks like a 30 mins ride to the main attractions so it's probably alright? I'd appreciate any advice.

I had a long train ride yesterday and wanted to start digging into the Making Time Fort Mifflin lineup to check out some of the artists that I'm not familiar with. I started with a spreadsheet and built out a small web app that helps navigate the lineup.

[https://mt2025.rivera.io/](https://mt2025.rivera.io/)

I went and generated some tags for each artist, and found a live set for each one. Some of the tags might not be 100% accurate -- but I tried my best. Tags are transformed into a vector and reduced to try and map artists who are most similar together.

You can navigate the lineup visually or view it as a list. The ""play"" button on the table links out to a live set so you can check each artist out. You can search by artist or by tag. i.e. searching ""Breakbeat"" will filter the list and re-render the visualization. 

I'd like to do this for other festivals as well if people find it useful. Check it out and let me know what you think. If you like it - maybe buy me a coffee - or don't - whatever! See you out there in September!

Picture this: you‚Äôre walking down the street, craving a coffee, and suddenly you spot something even more exciting than caffeine‚Äîa **Bitcoin ATM**. It‚Äôs glowing, it‚Äôs futuristic, and it promises access to the world‚Äôs hardest money at the tap of a touchscreen. But wait, how do you even use one of these things? And how do you make sure your wallet is ready to accept sweet, sweet sats in a flash?

That‚Äôs where [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in.

Let‚Äôs rewind for a sec. **Bitcoin ATMs** are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. From gas stations in Kansas to corner stores in California, these machines let you buy (and sometimes sell) Bitcoin with cash or card. No bank, no lengthy sign-up‚Äîjust you and the orange coin. But while the ATM itself handles the heavy lifting, *you* need a Bitcoin address to send those coins to. Enter: the QR code.

If you‚Äôve ever fumbled at the machine trying to type out a long, intimidating Bitcoin address by hand (spoiler: don‚Äôt do that), you already know the power of a QR code. It‚Äôs fast, scannable, and nearly foolproof. And that‚Äôs why we created the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**‚Äîa simple, fun, and free way to turn your Bitcoin address into a sleek, scan-ready QR code in seconds.

# Why It Matters

Using Bitcoin ATMs without a QR code is like going to a party without your phone‚Äîit‚Äôs technically possible, but it‚Äôs going to be awkward. With our app, you can walk up to any machine with confidence. Open the app, input your Bitcoin address, and boom‚Äîyou‚Äôve got a beautiful QR code ready to scan.

Oh, and we didn‚Äôt stop at just functionality. Our app lets you:

* Customize your QR code with different sizes
* Add a Bitcoin amount to request exact payments
* Download your QR for print or digital use
* Generate **payment buttons and links** for your website, blog, or even a cardboard sign (we‚Äôre not judging)

Want to sell lemonade for sats? Done. Want grandma to send you Bitcoin for your birthday? Just hand her a printout with your QR code. Want to look like a true crypto pro at the Bitcoin ATM? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.

# Your On-Ramp Just Got Smoother

Bitcoin ATMs are the on-ramps to the decentralized highway, and tools like ours make sure your vehicle is fueled up and ready. Whether you‚Äôre a newcomer stacking your first few sats or a seasoned HODLer loading up on dips, it pays to be prepared‚Äîand being prepared means having your QR code ready to roll.

He‚Äôs one to live life freely and do what he wants, a bit of a yolo. While I on the other hand am so cautious I might just do nothing if given the opportunity. 

We currently rent and our lease is up in November, he hit me the other week with a ‚ÄúI never want to rent again after this house‚Äù I understand where he is coming from, rent is so high we may as well be paying a mortgage and have equity. I have no idea what equity even means, the thought of buying a house seems very intimidating to me especially cause I‚Äôm essentially the bread winner. He works at a job he loves that pays him significantly less than my corporate job. I got especially spooked when I found out his credit score is less than ideal, it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúfair‚Äù while mine is ‚Äúgood‚Äù teetering on excellent. 

We aren‚Äôt looking at particularly expensive houses but the interest rates are insane, he says we can always refinance. I try to remind him our current rent includes our water and internet, so we will be paying that along with home owners insurance, taxes, ect. And he just kinda brushes me off. Owning a home will be significantly more expensive than our current rental situation it seems to me. I do want to own a house I just feel like we aren‚Äôt ready, he begs to differ says if we don‚Äôt do it now we will probably never do it. He thinks I‚Äôm being overly cautious again. 

I grew up very poor and get incredibly anxious when it comes to taking on debt, so he‚Äôs right in a way, I will probably never feel comfortable taking the plunge on a house. Neither one of us have rich parents who could front us money to help with down payments. He‚Äôs planning on paying the down payment by cashing out his crypto. He‚Äôs not really taking no for an answer on this house, he says he will just do it without me cause it‚Äôs what he wants. 

It‚Äôs stressing me out and I don‚Äôt know what the solution should be, or if I should live a little, go with his whim and have a house. I do like the house, it‚Äôs a bit more in the country near water, our animals would love it. I could see myself sipping coffee on the porch.

Hi, 26F here. Eldest of four. Ever since I started working at 21, parang automatic na akong breadwinner. I work in a BPO, night shift, decent pay, pero hindi ganun kalaki. The moment I got my first paycheck, my mom said, ‚ÄúAnak, bayaran mo na ‚Äòtong Meralco para hindi tayo maputulan.‚Äù No problem. Gave it. Pero from that day on, hindi na nawala ‚Äòyung expectations.

Fast forward to now‚Äîfive years later‚Äîako pa rin nagbabayad ng kuryente, tubig, internet, tuition ng bunso, minsan groceries. Tapos kahit may trabaho na si Papa (part-time delivery), parang hindi pa rin sapat. My two younger siblings are both in college‚Äîone has a part-time gig, the other none. I asked once if they could pitch in kahit kaunti. My mom got mad. ‚ÄúAnak, estudyante pa ‚Äòyan, focus nila aral. Hindi mo sila dapat pinapabayaan.‚Äù

Gusto ko naman tumulong. Pero minsan napapaisip ako, hanggang kailan? Wala akong ipon. Hindi ko pa rin kayang umalis sa bahay. Hindi ko ma-afford yung therapy na matagal ko nang gustong subukan. I say yes sa lahat kasi ayokong maramdaman nila na pabigat ako, pero deep inside, I feel like I‚Äôm drowning.

Last month, I cried inside a CR stall sa office kasi wala akong pera pang-commute for the next day. Literally P38 na lang laman ng GCash ko. Nagbabaon ako ng SkyFlakes at sachet coffee. Walang nakakaalam. Akala nila okay lang ako kasi lagi akong nakangiti.

My dream? Simple lang. Makaluwag. Makalipat sa mas tahimik na lugar. Makabili ng sariling gamit. Makaipon. Pero parang ang layo pa rin kahit anong kayod ko.

I‚Äôm not asking for pity. Gusto ko lang magsabi. Baka may iba rin diyan na panganay, na pagod na pero wala ring choice. Hindi tayo selfish. Tao lang din tayo.",3,1747147099.0,MayConfessionAko,5,0.81,False

One second I was bouncing between Wikipedia rabbit holes, and the next, I was staring at a government site that didn‚Äôt seem to exist.

¬†

The URL was just a string of numbers: http://173.82.41.6/internal/osc-2025/cognition-alert. No .gov, no agency logo. Just a plain black background and bright red text blinking at the top:

¬†

WARNING: CLASS-3 COGNITIVE THREAT DETECTED. DO NOT READ FURTHER.

¬†

That would‚Äôve been the point where any normal person clicks out, right? But the thing is, the page wasn‚Äôt open in my browser. It replaced whatever tab I had open before. I didn‚Äôt click a link. I didn‚Äôt type anything. It just appeared.

¬†

I told myself it was probably a prank. Some weird ARG. Maybe a hacker screwing with people using browser exploits. So I kept scrolling.

¬†

Below the warning was a dated message:

¬†

OSC-7 Directive (Issued: May 2, 2025, 03:41 EST)

A memetic hazard capable of inducing rapid psychogenic collapse has been identified in the continental United States. Primary vectors include:

‚Äì Visual glyphs (see attached image ‚Äì REDACTED)

‚Äì Auditory sequences (see MP3 ‚Äì REDACTED)

‚Äì Descriptive language.

¬†

The cognitohazard is considered linguistically self-propagating. Exposure to ANY description, symbolic representation, or paraphrasing may result in contamination.

¬†

If you are reading this and have not undergone OSC inoculation, cease immediately and report your exposure to 1-866-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà.

¬†

There was more. But I swear, the second I read the word ‚Äúself-propagating,‚Äù something hummed behind my eyes.

¬†

It wasn‚Äôt a sound. Not really. More like when you get a high fever and your thoughts turn syrupy. I scrolled down instinctively, like I was being pulled, even though every cell in my body screamed to stop.

¬†

The page kept updating in real-time, like a live incident feed. Users flagged in real-time. IPs blacklisted. Cities marked in red with ominous tags: ‚Äúcontaminated zone,‚Äù ‚Äúsilent mass casualty,‚Äù ‚Äúcontainment failed.‚Äù

¬†

I should‚Äôve stopped.

¬†

But then I saw my ZIP code on the list. Timestamped six minutes earlier.

¬†

At the bottom of the page, a block of code started printing itself:

¬†

markdown

Copy

Edit

\> INITIATING PROTOCOL ‚ñà‚ñà-‚ñà‚ñà¬†

\> TRACE COMPLETE¬†

\> USER LOGGED ‚Äì NO INOCULATION DETECTED¬†

\> SYNTACTIC EXPOSURE LEVEL: 91%¬†

\> SYMPTOM ONSET IN: 03:12

It counted down.

¬†

Three minutes.

¬†

I panicked. I tried shutting down my PC, but it wouldn‚Äôt power off. The screen flickered, flashing between the site and a strange symbol ‚Äî like a spiral made of tiny red letters, all spelling a word I can‚Äôt remember, but feel like I never stopped hearing since.

¬†

I grabbed my phone. No signal. No Wi-Fi. Just a new notification from a system app I never installed:

¬†

\[Cognition Alert: Level 3\] You have been exposed. Help is no longer applicable. Accept the thought. Let it spread.

¬†

¬†

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been awake. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve blinked. The spiral is burned into every surface now ‚Äî the walls, my coffee mug, the whites of my eyes. And worse, I‚Äôve started understanding it. Like it‚Äôs rewriting how I think, one word at a time.

¬†

If you've read this far, I‚Äôm sorry.

¬†

I tried to censor things, but I‚Äôm not sure it matters anymore.

The site‚Äôs gone now, of course. I tried to go back, and it just 404s.

¬†

But I think that was the point.

It just needed someone to read it.

To spread the seed.

To teach it how to get into your mind with less.

Just enough to keep growing.

¬†

If you feel something behind your eyes right now ‚Äî a hum, a word you didn‚Äôt mean to think ‚Äî it‚Äôs already too late.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt mean to pass it on.

Two days ago, a good friend of mine asked if we could grab coffee before work. I didn‚Äôt think much of it maybe she had some good news or just wanted to catch up. But when I arrived, she looked like she was about to cry. I kept asking her, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Are you okay?‚Äù Eventually, she told me she wasn‚Äôt upset for herself she was upset for me.

Then she showed me messages and photos from my girlfriend to another guy.

Last week, my girlfriend was at her place. She was on her phone when a message came through from someone saved as Baby. My friend assumed it was me and thought it might be funny to send a weird reply until she saw the message wasn‚Äôt from me. It was someone else entirely. So she scrolled through the conversation and took photos

Later, she confronted my girlfriend about it. My girlfriend brushed it off, saying, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a coworker. It‚Äôs just flirting. His girlfriend is fine with it.‚Äù But the messages said otherwise as they talked about meeting up and having sex.

After sending me the photos and messages she left for work, and I stayed in the caf√© for hours. Just sitting there.

When I got home, I told my girlfriend I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and suggested she stay at her place for a few days. These past two days have felt like weeks. I haven‚Äôt cried. I haven‚Äôt gotten angry. Just‚Ä¶ confused. We‚Äôve been together for two years. We‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs families. I was at her dad‚Äôs birthday just three weeks ago. We‚Äôve spent holidays together. And now? I don‚Äôt know how I feel. 

I‚Äôve never been cheated on before. I‚Äôve never cheated. I have no one to really talk to about this. I don‚Äôt want to burden my friend any more than I already have. I‚Äôm completely lost on how to handle the situation. It feels like our whole relationship was built on lies. I don‚Äôt know how long this has been happening. I remember last Christmas she was glued to her phone, and even her mom kept telling her to put it away. Was she already cheating back then? Was she lying every time she said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù?

My stomach hurts just thinking about it. I‚Äôve missed three days of work. I just want some advice. How do I approach this situation

For starters I went to a pretty good accredited school, it is a well known one and that is not to brag or say i have more knowledge just trying to paint a picture! 
 My nursing school journey was nothing short of faith in God, i started my program may 2023 right after graduating college with another bachelors degree, 2 days later i was starting my program and feeling nervous, i had never been a good test taker and a good planner for school, i always scrapped by regardless of how much i studied or lack there of, going into nursing school i had that same mentality never really knowing how to study or what to study, i ended up not performing well in pathophysiology so ended up dropping the class in hoes it wouldn‚Äôt tank my GPA. come to find out i was not allowed to retake the class until they offered it again in January so i had to wait to retake one class for 6 months and then only retake that one class for a semester, i was stressing and feeling discouraged, but i put my faith into the Lord and saw it out because i knew this is what i wanted to do. I ended up THRIVING in nursing school following figuring out how to study and what to study!!! Once i graduated in December, i went back home to get some much needed family time in.
I started studying for my Nclex in January 2025 until my state had said i needed a vaild license to test in that state ( i am from another one). So i stopped studying i wasn‚Äôt in that state and didn‚Äôt want to loose my momentum with how i was studying. 
Once i got back to my state that said oh hey here is your ATT you can test, well what did i do i scheduled my exam 4 weeks after i got that email but i had already planned a vacation and going to vist my friend for a week for her birthday, so i was not studying, I came home from all of those things feeling run down and did not end up to start studying until basically the week before, 
The week before I would do a readiness assessment everyday but i would look up answers if i didn‚Äôt know them because i thought oh this will help me with my studying, i watch a few mark k lectures and the day before my test did not study or anything and same for the day of ( i will get into this in a second) I went into my test not feeling nervous at all ( out of pure ignorance i will admit) i thought oh i got this i did so good on my hesi and didnt study for those. and in turn told everyone i was ‚Äúraw dogging‚Äù the nclex. i walk into my testing center and wait to sit for my boards. 
There were some things at my testing center that just were not right if that makes sense i am a very environmental person and vibes and the space is really important to me, my hand wasn‚Äôt reading on the scanner etc etc. 
so im sitting for my test and i thought this is weird you know its not hard but i didnt know one of the answers felt like i was shooting blinding into a dark alley hoping it would be what i needed, i took one break and before 85? and i remember getting to 85 and it not shutting off, it kept going all the way to 150 and i remember thinking please dont shut off at 120 becuase i would have freaked out, it took me about 2 hours with a break to answer all 150? NOT GOOD. after the exam i was confident i was like mayeb i passed you know i feel like i have a good background and did the pop up and got the ‚Äúbad‚Äù one and the next morning morning it was confirmed i did not pass, i wallowed i was sad but I DID NOT GIVE UP. i got an amazing job the next Monday and then picked myself back up. 
I was getting ready to move but i knew i needed to study so after a week of just giving myself a break to breath, i started the grind answering small amounts of questions AND UNDERSTANDING THEM AND WHY THEY WERE WRONG or RIGHT, not just answering and never looking at the rationals. 
I moved got situation and started  studying i got my CPR report and saw the two areas that were below passing were simple and probably something i just didn‚Äôt know how to answer. 
 I got a tutor through archer and met with her 4 times to help with studying question answering and all that jazz. SHE WAS AMAZING 
I would use my cpr to answer questions in the weakest areas and wouldn‚Äôt study more than 3-4 hours a day. i also gave myself sunday to chill relax go be normal. I would go to my apartments study room to get out of a comfortable environment like my apartment. i would listen to MARK K on spotify while laying out at the pool or doing random tasks at home, and not just listening to listen to get it over with i had the yellow book and filled it out! 
leading up to my new exam date ( i have a job that i needed to pass for so i had to schedule) i had a meeting with my tutor, i did one CAT on archer said pass, i did 2 readiness assessments for high and very high. i tried to not stress answering a certain number but answering questions and doing questions and understanding, the day before my exam i studied i did i think it‚Äôs important to do that at lease for me to get my brain in the right mindset for testing. i read over my yellow book and did about 50-60 practice questions, WHEN I SAY I READ THAY YELLOW BOOK a million times on sunday i did. Monday morning rolls around and i again read the yellow book ate breakfast and had my coffee, drove to the testing center ( talked to my mom the whole way to help with anexity) and i personally got there 2 hours before i tested to mark k lecture 12 LOVE HIM and read over my notes and few more times. i know they say not to do this BUT I NEED TO IT HELPS ME SO MUCH. they say if you don‚Äôt know it then you won‚Äôt know it after reading but im the opposite if i see it before the test i can be like oh i jsut saw that it‚Äôs a b or c. 
Walked into the testing center felt anxious and all the things but knew Gods timing over my timing always and this is his plan for me. sat down and started got to questions 20 no anxiety but it had taken me 45 minutes so i used the restroom, and came back 
THIS TIME AROUND i had so many CASE STUDIES and one bow-tie a few SATA and like 3 med questions all that i learned from mark K (so thankful for him). i was nearing the end and had a case study at like question 70 and i saw the timer and i had like 2 hours left, i was so scared if it were to have taken me to 150 i would have had to BOOGIE but i didnt let me fear control me i took a deep breath and on question 85 hit next and it shut off, I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO THINK but i knew it was better than my first one, i didnt know it that was because of my studying or becuase of how CAT works. 
was a nervous wreck all night last night and woke up this morning to and email and im proud to say after all the ups and downs and everything I AM A RN!! 
never thought this day would come but it has and im so glad JUST KNOW IF I CAN YOU CAN DONT DOUBT YOURSELF EVER AND REMEMBER GODS GOT YOU ALWAYS. 
i‚Äôm hoping if you‚Äôve read this whole thing it can help you and just know never get up on your dream a dream is a dream for a reason.

I usually weigh right in the morning as well, but haven't weighed in weeks. 

Basically my story is that I was 175lbs 6 years ago and lost weight with my lowest being 128 lb. I usually and comfortable at 130 ish lb, and found 134 around my higher end. I had weighed in at 138lb in January and decided I would start cutting calories again, this was successful although I found it really hard to stick to a calorie deficit as I was quite depressed and lonely in the winter and finishing grad school and getting over a 7 year relationship break up. 

So anyway, I had got down to around 134 consistently, then I stopped weighing before I went to my home town for 3 weeks after exams, but I was eating in a deficit most days, walking a lot, and working out. Last week I was back in my apartment and still went on some walks, although was on my period, was tired, and kind of snacked a bit much at night. I went on a small weekend trip with friends this weekend and after looking at some photos wanted to get serious about cutting calories again and measuring everyhting and consistently working out (which has been a lot easier now that school is done). I am also out of my depressive funk.

Regardless, I bought a new digital scale today and weighed myself after my morning coffee and water and was 142lb. I felt discouraged, I know it takes consistency, but I just don't understand how I gained 7 lb since my last weigh in when I've been working out, eating well, etc :( I am going to go back to counting calories now, but some encouragement would be helpful.

We are a family of four (two adults, children aged 3 and 5). We will be coming from Bergamo by train (leaving the 28th) en route to a family event in Bellagio which will take place on the 3rd of July (so we will sleep in Bellagio on the 2nd). Since we need to end in Bellagio, we figured we would go somewhere else on Lake Como first.

The question is whether to stay in Varenna or Bellano. None of us need very complex facilities to be happy (playground or swimming pool, streets and trails to wander around, grocery store, coffee/wine and gelato) and our kids are intrepid travelers. We will likely stay in a holiday apartment or Airbnb, there seem to be plenty of both in both villages.

I'm not sure how to make the final call. Will Varenna be crowded to the point of misery at this time of the season? Is Bellano significantly less fun or interesting to spend a few days? Is one or the other better for kids? I would appreciate any of your advice. We've been to Rome several times and all around Sicily but the north is new territory for us.

I had a long train ride yesterday and wanted to start digging into the lineup to check out some of the artists that I'm not familiar with. I started with a spreadsheet and built out a small web app that helps navigate the lineup.

  
[https://mt2025.rivera.io/](https://mt2025.rivera.io/)

I went and generated some tags for each artist, and found a live set for each one. Some of the tags might not be 100% accurate -- but I tried my best. Tags are transformed into a vector and reduced to try and map artists who are most similar together.

You can navigate the lineup visually or view it as a list. The ""play"" button on the table links out to a live set so you can check each artist out. You can search by artist or by tag. i.e. searching ""Breakbeat"" will filter the list and re-render the visualization. Check it out and let me know what you think. If you like it - maybe buy me a coffee - or don't - whatever! See you out there in September!

1klnb64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1klnb64/does_bella_versabrew_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does bella VersaBrew Coffee Maker Deliver Versatility and Style Review for Coffee Lovers?,"**Aesthetic Appeal and Compact Design**  
The bella 35104-016A VersaBrew 2-in-1 Coffee Maker has a slim and modern design that blends seamlessly into any kitchen. Its ""Fits-anywhere"" profile is a huge plus for those like me with limited counter space. I placed it under a cabinet in my rather tiny kitchen, and it's a perfect fit, barely taking up room. The Oatmilk color adds a touch of softness, making it a stylish contrast against metallic or darker appliances. Measuring just 6.33"" D x 14.72"" W x 13.14"" H, it‚Äôs clear this machine was designed with practicality in mind. It‚Äôs lightweight as well, at only 6.61 pounds, making it easy to move on cleaning days. Unlike bulkier coffee machines I‚Äôve owned, this product doesn‚Äôt dominate my counter like a behemoth‚Äîwhich is always a relief.  

**Versatility in Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker truly lives up to its name by offering versatility. Whether you want a quick 8oz single-serve cup or need an entire 12-cup carafe to keep the whole family caffeinated during holiday breakfasts, it has you covered. As someone who switches between single-serve pods during rushed mornings and freshly ground beans on slower Sundays, the dual-brew feature is fantastic. The inclusion of both a reusable pod filter and a carafe filter ensures you‚Äôre not locked into one brewing method. I like using the iced coffee function, holding the button as instructed to create a chilled brew for hot summer afternoons. Despite the sheer variety, I found it intuitive to operate, thanks to neatly labeled buttons.  

[Want bella 35104-016A VersaBrew 2-in-1 Coffee Maker? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyjcqhfl/)  

**Customization Features for All Needs**  
The adjustable drip tray is another thoughtful addition. My large travel mug, which I rely on daily for work, fits snugly without any awkward tilting or spillage. At the same time, smaller cups fit just as easily, thanks to the flip-down tray feature. Its ability to handle mugs of up to 7 inches tall is something my previous coffee maker sorely lacked. The warming plate has also made mornings less chaotic, as it keeps coffee warm in the carafe for up to two hours. I noticed the mixing tube in the carafe lid ensures every pour is consistent‚Äîa small but crucial detail for consistent taste.  

**Ease of Maintenance**  
One thing I‚Äôve grown to appreciate after owning several coffee makers is how easy this one is to clean. The filters, carafe, and filter holder are all dishwasher-safe, which saves me time and hassle. Additionally, the clean indicator light serves as a polite nudge to descale the machine before any significant buildup occurs. Even the large 60oz water reservoir reduces the frequency of refills, which is incredible when I‚Äôm less than alert in the mornings.  

**Advantages**  
- Slim, space-saving design perfect for smaller kitchens.  
- Adjustable tray accommodates mugs of all sizes.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts for effortless cleaning.  
- Dual brewing options cater to different preferences.  

**Negatives**  
- The machine sometimes feels slightly slower when brewing a full carafe compared to competitors.  
- The buttons are handy but could be more satisfying tactile-wise when pressed.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing this to other dual-purpose coffee makers, the bella VersaBrew stands out for its slim profile and customizable single-serve options. Competitors like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offer similar dual-brewing functionalities, but they lack the sleek design and efficient use of vertical space. Meanwhile, the Keurig Duo is a close rival but has a noticeably noisier operation. What sets this coffee maker apart is the thoughtful inclusion of dishwasher-safe components and the intuitive iced coffee function, which many alternatives don‚Äôt feature in such a user-friendly manner.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Taking into account its multifunctionality, durable build, and stylish design, I find the cost of this product justified. It provides features that suit all types of coffee drinkers while keeping maintenance hassle-free. Investing in a machine like this adds genuine utility to your mornings without breaking the bank.

[1000‚Ç¨],"As title suggests, I am looking to expand from filter coffees to espresso, and am in search of grinder that can do both relatively well. Currently I am using Baratza Encore, which obviously cannot grind fine enough, so replacing grinder comes before buying espresso machine. 
I am mostly drinking ligher roasts, however plan to experiment a bit with beans selection in the future. Expecting usage profile to be ~60% filter/40% espresso, with espresso being often used as a base for milk drinks. I value ease of use/smooth workflow over smaller footprint and lower noise level over potential upgradeability and being able to squeeze absolutely best cup oflut of beans.

The models I am currently looking at are:

Eureka Mignon Single Dose Pro: looks like biggest gripes people tend to report about non-pro version has been resolved - better dial, angled base, etc. Reported to be relatively quiet, however there are not so many reviews yet, so I am not sure how easy it is to switch between espresso and v60 and whether retention might be an issue.

DF64V gen2 - cheapest in the list, least bulky, but often referred to as very loud (unless I am mixing it up with DF64 without V). Not sure how good it is for switching to filter with stock burrs and I am really not looking forward to fiddling with upgrades at this point. 

Timemore 078s - priciest in the list, probably lowest retention and being marketed as targeting both espresso and pour-over, a bit polarised reviews, bigger footprint and a bit debatable design, but presumably very low retention and smooth workflow.

Is there strong reason to prefer one over another for my usecase? Is there some option I am missing? ~~Should I switch to instant coffee instead to appreciate proper one better?~~

‚ÄúYou live you learn‚Äù I read as
I glance down at a paper and see 2 sparrows drawn &, those exact words written w script on cascading banners wrapping around the art
this is was my so called ‚Äúmentors‚Äù sketch book, & looking back now I find it all quite ironic..

Once I had my dream job.
I was 18 and got a tattoo apprenticeship one month after i graduated HS
I was beyond  proud.

I originally had wanted to go to art school to be a fine painter, however it being far out of my budget - I didn‚Äôt see this as an option.
 I had also tried to take college placement courses and they made me feel bad at my low scores- so I gave up on further education tthat day 

 I saw tattooing  as a huge opportunity to advance my art skills as well as make a career and name for myself in my community. 

I wish I had known better.
I wish I had seen red flags. 
I wish I would have waited‚Ä¶ 

This next part of the story may be triggering for some so definitely read from here on with caution- I was a victim of s3xual harassment & such when I was 18-20 years young while working for a 41-42 year old man at a tattoo shop. 2007-2009 befor being admitted to a psych ward against my will. 
Later In my 30s I began to make sense of it more and process what really happened .. 

This post is essentially some of what I can recall as well as a bit of a trauma dump cos a lot is coming back to me again sadly and I have to write about it. It helps. 

I‚Äôm likely gonna edit the post a few times so just bear with me and read with Caution

‚ö†Ô∏è 

I had a  boss once who essentially was trying to groom me and sexually harassed me / grabbed my as s often, calling my skinny jeans my ‚Äúcome get me somes‚Äù insinuating ‚Äúcome get me some sex‚Äù 

He would  even go on to joke once about üçá-ing me & would watch actual  üåΩ in the shop or disturbing vids - 1 guy 1 jar or ‚Äúcake farts ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ for example ‚Ä¶ - _ - 
& often times he liked Share his s3x life with us etc. going on to tellus in detail accounts of his past relations with people. 

I was 1 month out of high school at this point in my life (18h Him? 41.

I always thought that, Quite frankly his TMI was never  not appropriate for the work place. But I didn‚Äôt understand 

To add - He was insanely sexist, racist and homophobic. Often complaining about his an ex who was gay after he was with her‚Ä¶ 

I also witnessed him once tattoo a logo for a band called skrewdriver (I believe they‚Äôre a neo natzee band) on some guy. 

& not to mention his h8tred for  woman because he h8ed me & I‚Äôve seen his record‚Ä¶
His girl at the time called the shop once crying to me bout him, to me of all ppl - about his actions, and his drvg use (despite him ‚Äúh8ing dvigs‚Äù cos it would give his shop a ‚Äú bad reputation‚Äù) 

He h8ed gay people it seemed too cos he often talked down about my gay brother who was also only 16 at the time. He loved the F slur. 
He‚Äôd Pick on my clothes , hair , makeup and even my music idk why .. and dear lord he listened to fucckin NUMETAL 
The audacity tbh. 

He was a full blown alcoholic, a closet crack head (yet talked mad sh!t about drvg addicts and looked down on them like I previously mentioned - mad weird .) 

and he smoked cigarettes *INSIDE* the shop daily (against the law- against health codes- uhm literally open skin and blood-and air borne pathogens?! Tf) talk about gross asf 
When we cleaned we just used Clorox bleach sprays . Really no real disinfectant for shops at all . Just bleach. My machines corroded from this- rusted.

 I was his bitch for 2 years running all shop errands(especially when I got my truck) , cleaning up all his messes (including setting up his machines, pouring all his inks, and breaking it all down when done and sanitation and sterilization of all equipment *autoclave*) before disposal tubes and shit ‚Ä¶ the other people that worked and ‚Äúlearned  ‚Äú under him did not have to do this after being hired on. And they made more money than I did. 

He also had me running and  getting his food and cigs and coffee cos he didn‚Äôt drive nor did I (at first)  so I would walk in all weather for his bitch ass EVEN AFTER BEING HIRED AS A TATTOOIST to near gas stations, food places etc. for whatever the little baby needed‚Ä¶
I was beyond disrespected and violated in every way and he took total advantage of me. 

In the end he was 1 of 3 ‚Äú triggers ‚Äú the doctors  words not mine- they said in 2009 in my first psych stay- where I was admitted against my will due to trauma .. lucky me.

I‚Äôd also like to add that  it  is scary that when I share this-many other young people or people in general- come forward and speak about how they  have to 
 or had to endure similar - and I h8 that part 

I also have to add that paid him 3k in 6
Months for the ‚Äúapprenticeship ‚Äú and he claimed I was short ‚Ä¶ -  _  -  and when he was mad he would turn red and veins would pop. He would scream at us but mostly me. During those years he tended  scared me a lot tbh 

While apprenticing - Id gave him damn near my whole check weekly working 7 days a week 2 jobs and 70-80 hours between them both (and one was
To pay for the other so I got $0 most weeks)  . I remember Barely eating, smoking my moms cigarette buts (cos I couldn‚Äô no longer afford
To smoke) , & never going out cos if I called off I risked being Fired. 
This is why I missed skatopia 08-09
I even gave a friend my dad‚Äôs records collection for a ride home from the shop one night.

I also got my own equipment (1.5k) and I figured I‚Äôd have to do that tbh but jfc ‚Ä¶ he honestly did the most to hurt me and others who worked for him during those years  & it feels in retrospect that he this was his intent . 

He ended up rushing my learning months cos he seen me as a money maker for him. 
& when I‚Äôd ask questions about tattooing - how or what he‚Äôd claim I should know that!!  and not explain and make me feel stupid belittling me in turn cos he got a rise from all this weird behavior 

Anything that went wrong in the shop was somehow my fault too - a light fell once and shattered over night near my station (when me and my coworker opened - the mess was there when we came in!) and but next day I was to blame somehow .to elaborate was like the ceilings in school drop ceiling style - the cover for the fluorescent lights fell- shattered- my fault 
- _ -

So in turn I feel now was scammed and taken advantage of as well as used in so many ways while being harassed in the work place cos he was in a position of power and I wasn‚Äôt . 
All while he attempted to groom Me? 

I was at his mercy I felt and I didn‚Äôt wanna fvck that chance at a career up..but I also didn‚Äôt understand a lot. 

Sadly he projected sm Onto me and the other artists it was hard to work with I was always on egg shells in the shop. So My dream job began to crumble before my eyes‚Ä¶. As did I 

I once witnessed him throw a vacuum at my coworker cos he wasn‚Äôt cleaning soon enough.. he made the same coworker tattoo some ridiculous pro DV tattoo flash on him that read 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me tell you twice‚Äù
With a cartoon of a woman with a black eye.. wtf
The artist who created the flash sheet I think was William Web- can‚Äôt find the art now however tons of his other shitty work can be found on google‚Ä¶- how convenient 

 This boss I had tho  would go on to seemingly use intimidation tactics to break me of me ‚Äútimid‚Äù ways. He always said that I was timid‚Ä¶ I was a basically a kid..  he also referred to my bf who was POC at the time , as racial slurs and then would ask if I was headed to fvck him for the weekend as I walked to my truck 

.. Actually he often said this type of thing to me. And it now all lives inside my head rent free. 

To add, when I got to driving again- he copped rides from me any chance he could  cos his lisence was suspended for DUIS AND NOT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT 

he was even jailed for that when working with him‚Ä¶..

Fvckin a man 

Life can truly be a rollar coaster and really just saying- if ur going thru it especially at work- and if it feels wrong or if ever u feel violated- speak up . 
Cos I truly regret not but I also do not blame myself any longer 
I go to therapy now and yadadada 
But just like- you‚Äôre not alone if this story sounds similar 
And I know help is available I just was humiliated and honestly didn‚Äôt know better 
So in the end i paid with my mental health . I really hope no one ever has to go thru This shit cos it sticks with ya sadly . And I am working on it not‚Ä¶ but it takes time I‚Äôm Finding out.

But If u read this far Thank u for reading sm and sorry ahead of time if I don‚Äôt reply to comments 
And I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm scattered and bad at writing just ugh ! It‚Äôs some days it can be a black cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è I can‚Äôt seem to shake

It‚Äôs more than just skincare. It‚Äôs a quiet act of self-recognition - a way of reminding myself I‚Äôm here, that I exist beyond the noise. The cool touch against my skin is a promise - time is mine, even if just for a moment.

The record player crackles to life, and the room fills with something warm, something that doesn‚Äôt ask anything of me. No lyrics to decode, just the gentle hum of sound that holds me. I breathe a little easier. I let myself be quiet.

I grab my iced coffee - cold against my palm, a quick jolt awake. No frills, just the sharp, bitter kick I need. The cubes clink, a quiet reminder that I‚Äôm here, anchored in this moment.

And then I write. Not for anyone else. Not for likes or validation. Just words spilling out, tangled and unpolished, a mirror I‚Äôm not afraid to look into. Some mornings, it‚Äôs messy - a confession I didn‚Äôt know I needed. Other mornings, it‚Äôs just a whisper - barely a thought, but still mine.

Because in those moments, I‚Äôm not a version of myself. I‚Äôm just me. No noise, no expectations. Just peace.
