1obhimr,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1obhimr/just_pouring_out/,Just pouring out.,"A few notes first. TW Nmom, trauma dumping?, abuse, brief animal murder, I don't know what all exactly to tag, but generally, bad vibes. I'm a woman, adult, closer to middle age than young adult. I'm pretty sure I have autism but I'm not sure if I was diagnosed as a kid or not. Also, my head doesn't work right anymore, for example, I often forget how old I am unless I sit down and do the math, some days I forget which name is mine unless I make a point to think about it, and my timeframe is totally off, I was shocked yesterday to find out it's October, I thought it was February, and I kind of feel like I'm missing years. So, timeline is going to be unclear, and out of order. I'll try to make it line up, but I do have issues with that, sorry for any confusion in advance. Also, I wasn't raised like I should have been. I know how to cook, clean, fill out applications and some forms. I think my social skills have dropped off over the years. There are things I know I should know as an adult, but I never learned. When something comes up, if I can, I usually look it up right then. I say that to let you know, I don't know what all I'm doing or should be doing. I'm not looking for advice or help, I just need someone to hear me. 



So, I live with my Nmom and grandmother. For years I've been doing this thing I call ""putting myself in prison,"" which is staying in my room during the day and coming out at night to clean and cook. I've gone through phases of doing this, I think 4 phases now. This most recent one has been a year. I know my mental and physical health both plummet when I'm around my mom, but I didn't realize how badly until my most recent stent. I knew my hair was falling out, I didn't realize it was from stress, I was worried I had a medical issue or wasn't getting enough protein, but after a few months of being away from her, it's grown back. I was also stressed to the point where I couldn't form a sentence. I would sit in my room alone and try to practice talking, and I couldn't get anything out. I would try to type or write what I was thinking, and it was so jumbled. I'm better now. 

My mother has always done this thing, since I was a kid, where she would buy groceries for herself and for her other kid, and I wasn't allowed to eat them. She wouldn't tell me what I couldn't have, she never specifically said I couldn't eat, but it was enforced with beatings from her, her other kid, and my grandmother. I was accused of stealing food. I lived off of ramen and peanut butter, I still can't eat either now. I would scarf down food at babysitters houses and at school, and I would get in trouble for eating so fast. I don't really understand how, but I got obese. 

My mom didn't want me, she cried that when she found out that she was pregnant with me, she felt stuck. She told me she didn't want me. She told me one time when she was angry that she tried to abort me, my dad (awful too, but out of the picture,) also told me she tried to get rid of me, and a few family members have also implied the same. I was hospitalized for dehydration a few times as and kid and once for ""rolling off the bed,"" I am suspicious about that one. She has endless funny and sweet stories about her other kid's childhood, all she has about me is that I never stopped crying, she even implied that as an infant, I did it on purpose. She accused me of being a ""whore"" when I was 4 or 5 because neighbor kids would bring food to my window and talk to me through my window, and that's an accusation she hasn't let me live down since. She kept babysitters around who would abuse me and not question her. She cut out anybody who actually paid attention and saw that something was wrong. That's something I think about often, how she was able to find so many adults who were willing to assist, participate, or cover up. 

Her other kid also beat me regularly. I don't understand why I didn't die. They stomped on my neck, on my head, on my chest, my sternum is fucked, I have dents in my head. They did this thing where they choked me until I went purple, stopped, then did it again, they did that a few times. I asked them so many times why they would attack me, and they said because it was funny to see me in pain, and another time they said they jerked off thinking about beating me and me being scared. They also did this thing where they would catch lizards and snakes and grind them between two cinder blocks. There's no doubt that they probably turned out really bad, but I've been no contact with them for years, I don't have it in me to open that can of worms. I feel guilty about that, but I don't know what to legally do if I'm right about what my worries are, so I've been telling myself I won't look into it until I'm okay, but I don't know if that's going to happen. Her other kid enjoyed beating me, but my mother would use them to beat me too, she told me that they couldn't go to jail when they were a minor, but if I called the police on them, I would go to jail, and I believed her, lol. I was just a kid.  

My mother worked with law enforcement my whole life. I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried calling 911. Most of the time, mom would call them, or they would call her, and she would convince them not to come out. Only twice ever did they show up. The first time, I was waiting at the door, I was telling them everything, then she came to the door, told me to go inside, I said no, the COPS physically moved me inside and closed the door so they could talk to her, then they left. The second time, they saw the bruises, they nodded the whole time I was talking, then told me they were good friends with my mom, knew that she ""would never let something like that happen,"" told me that I needed to start behaving, and told me they hoped I would start getting along better with my mom. They refused to give me any papers. I think this was before body cameras. I do not remember any names. Her best friend was someone who worked with abused people, she saw what happened, and I'll never understand why she believed my mom. I know my mom put this narrative out when I was a kid that there was something wrong with me, that I was evil and that she was a poor, saintly mom who struggled with her kid but just loved me so much she couldn't bring herself to do anything with me. I don't understand how nobody could be around and NOT SEE that that didn't make sense. 

The punishments were so bizarre. When I was in first grade, I didn't do my homework, I know I should have, but I didn't, and as punishment, she started taking away my bookbag when I got home, and I wouldn't be able to do my homework, so she'd keep taking my bag as punishment, and throughout elementary and middle school, I didn't do my homework. By high school, I just didn't care. I told police, guidance counselors, teachers, gym coaches, the school nurses, school office workers, and the school resource officers all what was happening at home, and that I needed help, responses I got were they didn't believe me because I slept in class, because I didn't do my homework, because I would come to school unshowered and without my hair brushed even though her other kid came to school clean, that I wore black clothes, that a mother would never do that, that someone who worked with law enforcement would never do that, that her other kid was fine, and that girls are dramatic, and the one that hurt the most was when they believed me but didn't want to get involved. I didn't finish high school. I wasn't allowed to learn to drive because I was ""irresponsible,"" and my mother ""didn't trust me not to take off."" She doesn't know me well, but she did get that one right. 

I moved out of state to live with family, and it was the best year of my life. That family was dysfunctional, but it was so much better. I loved going outside, growing up I wasn't allowed out, I had to sneak out to play as a child, sometimes she would lock me out, then punish me for staying at a neighbor's house without permission. I ended up afraid of going outside, still am a little. But when I had moved away, I loved outside. I even loved sleeping outside. I loved talking to people. I loved getting to go run errands with family. I loved watching TV. I got punished at my mom's house, I was always grounded, I would be made to sit in the living room, I wasn't allowed to sit on the furniture, and I wasn't allowed to watch TV, but if I did look, or if they just wanted to accuse me of looking, I would get slapped or punched in the head, but out of state, I could watch TV. It was so nice. I loved eating sandwiches. It was great. The first night I was there, my family cooked for me, they asked me what I liked and my favorite school lunch was spaghetti, so that's what I said, and it was the first time anyone cooked for me, and I'll never forget it. We had spaghetti, garlic bread, and green beans, it was so much food I had it for leftovers for the next too days, I loved it! 

Technically I was still a minor, my mother drove me out of state to stay with family, to teach me a lesson. She had threatened all the time when I was a kid to send me there, the threat being that they would beat me to death. I ended up going because I finally agreed. I figured at least it would stop. Turns out, they were the good ones. The story my family and I got was that I was going to finish school there then go to college, but she put a hold on my papers with my old school and told them that I would be back in a few months. I couldn't get enrolled, and I just had a few more months before I was an adult, I think she panicked. My family members had a medical emergency, and she took the opportunity to tell me she was going to have them arrested for harboring a minor if I didn't come back. My family wasn't sure, because they knew she brought me there, and they knew what she was about, but they also knew she worked with law enforcement, and that she could make things bad. They told me I didn't have to go, but I got scared. I was still a kid, I didn't know. I agreed to go back. She lied to her people here and said I was begging to come back because I was ""being abused,"" and everybody believed her no matter what I said. 

She still wouldn't let me learn to drive. She wouldn't let me get a job because ""how would I get there."" I had to cook and do the household chores for her, her other kid, and her mom. It was bad, but that was when I started isolating myself, and that helped a lot. We had good days sometimes too. One day I was sitting with her watching tv (I wasn't not allowed to watch tv when I came back,) also, once I turned 18, the beatings almost completely stopped, and from how I understood it at the time, it was so much better, I thought things had changed, now I know that they were protecting themselves. 

Well, we were watching tv, and by that time, her other kid had started messing with heavy drugs. They were running in and out of the house, running up to the door listening, running outside and hiding under the window to listen, and we really were watching tv and not talking about them at all. Well, they got a little too tweaked, came in, and demanded I get out. I said no, and I shouldn't have. I know now it's okay to stand up for myself, but I also knew at the time what the consequences would be. They began to beat me, and the first and only time in my life, my mom put her arms out in front of me, and told them to stop. They stopped for a moment, stared at her, then punched her in the face. It was the first time they ever hit her. I still hear that wet crack, the woody thud of the headboard, and the ""umph!"" sound she made. I feel like I can feel that sound in my ear now. She called the cops, and had her other kid move out. They haven't moved back since. Shortly after that was the last time I ever saw or spoke to them. I also spoke to the police, they actually gave me papers and took pictures, they told me I needed to take them to the courthouse to press charges. My mother refused to take me for over a month, then after that, my papers ""disappeared."" That was over a decade ago. Knowing more about these things now, I know not only was she always going to protect them, I also suspect there's a little emotional incest at play, as well as HEAPS of internalized misogyny.

The last time I went to a dentist was when I was in middle school, the last time I had an eye appointment, it's been a few years, got a $10 eye exam and $60 glasses, using them now, love them. The last time I went to a gp was I think more than a decade ago. I had a medical issue where I was losing a lot of blood, my skin was turning green. It doesn't go witchy green, it just gets really pale and it looks like there's a layer of something green underneath. I also had a hard time standing up for long enough to do chores without fainting, and I did faint twice in that time. I got to the point I was staying in bed, this was my first stint. Health wasn't great, but mental health improved a LOT. I would almost pass out walking to the toilet, less than 10 feet away, I would have to sit down in the shower, I fell asleep in there a few times. Because I was sick, I wasn't able to keep up with chores. I also was not cooking anything, I didn't eat often, and when I did, it was things I could eat laying down, so like a banana, a sandwich, and so on. I wasn't generating much mess at all. The only gocha I ever got on my mother in my life was when she loved going on and on about how I never do anything, and I asked her, if that's so then why was the only time I was to sick to work the time that we got roaches and mice in our house. She didn't say anything about my not cleaning for a few years after that, but now she denies that I was ever sick, that I was faking it and being lazy.

A family friend, who was one of my old babysitters and who was also abusive when I was a kid, came and helped us clean. It took about a month, the trash had piled up across the kitchen and living room, the dishes in the sink were in black water, trash and dirty dishes all over all surfaces. Think Hoarders. I tried helping with the cleaning, and the family friend noticed I looked ill and like I was going to pass out, I told her about what was going on, she asked why I wouldn't go to the doctor, I told her I had no money, she told me I was on my mom's insurance, I told her my mom said I wasn't, I was under 26, so turns out, I was. When I was first having this problem, I told my mom, she chewed me out because I didn't have a job and couldn't pay for it, she said she couldn't afford it, then the next day she went out and bought more than $700 worth of paintings. Half of those are still in a corner on the floor. When this family friend heard all of this, she confronted my mom, who gave her a different story, and she told me, so I said let's all have one conversation so we're all on the same page. 

When we sat down, mom told her she offered to take me to the doctor, but I was too lazy to go and wouldn't call to make an appointment, I said that's not true, I asked if I would make an appointment right then would she take me, she said yes. All of this was Infront of family friend. I called, made the appointment, my mom was red, and really did start to sweat. We picked a day, mom tried to say the family friend would be there to clean on that day so I should choose a different one, but the family friend told her that she wanted to be there to make sure I got to my appointment. Morning of, mom tried to pull the emotional manipulation, begged me not to go because she couldn't afford it and because she had a headache, I reminded her that our family friend had offered to pay. The three of us went, they dropped me off at the dr, for my appointment. I paid $15 for the appointment. I called mom to pick me up, she refused to answer. I called the family friend, she answered, told mom, and mom started fussing about how I didn't call her, and family friend told her she could see her phone. The prescription cost $35. She was paying family friend $400 a week to help us with our home. After a week or so, I was already doing a lot better. I was able to stay on top of chores after that. Mom went no contact with that family friend after that. I don't know how to feel. That family friend did abuse me, but she also helped me out so much. 

So, I've had two real jobs in my life. The first one was at a department store, I loved it. I had looked for jobs before that, but my mom worked against me. I'm so grateful that this community exists, because EVERYBODY in my life who I've tried to talk to about my mom working against me cannot wrap their heads around that. But when I would fill out applications, she would refuse to take me to interviews and would instruct my grandmother not to take me. A friend took me to the one I did get, and I didn't tell my mom about that interview or when I got it, it was a few months before she found out. 

The only bank account I had at the time was a joint one we opened before I had moved, when I was a minor. That's where I was getting my pay deposited at. I know better now, but I was still young at that time. She found my work uniform, then checked the account. I found out she found out when I went to go use my debit card and the account was empty. I was using my money for work clothes, toiletries, groceries, giving gas money to friends and my grandmother, or buying food in exchange for gas money for friends or grandmother, and paying the water and trash bill to my grandmother. I had a few thousand in my account, maybe 2? All gone. I confronted her, she denied it, so I told her I was going to file a report with the bank, she went off. She took it all for rent and bills, said I owed her for all of my childhood and the few adult years too. So, what I started doing was waiting by the atm on payday, and taking out all but $215, $200 for bills, $15 to leave a balance in the account so there wouldn't be a fee. I also kept paying water and trash bills to my grandmother. When I worked on payday, she would take it all but $15. I lost my cool, started spending money as soon as the check showed up as pending, bought gift cards, ordered groceries, way over spent, but it was the only way I could get stuff done. Would leave enough for the $15 balance and the $30 overdraft fee. Nothing for bills for her. I was in the wrong for that. I know she was wrong too, but I wasn't innocent, I did shit wrong too. I did know better than to not try to help with bills. 

After that, she sabotaged me. She cut off my phone so I couldn't call friends or uber, and she instructed my grandmother not to take me to work. My grandmother let me use her phone twice, then my mom told her not to anymore after that. I asked the neighbors by me, one didn't answer, one asked a lot of questions about why my mom and grandmother wouldn't help before telling me she didn't want to get involved, another let me use her phone twice before telling me she didn't feel comfortable helping me anymore. I'm not upset with them, it wasn't their business, and I appreciate that the one did help me out. She would cut my phone on and off, because she still needed it as a leash for me. She had moved out before that.

So, where I was working, I wasn't making bank by any means. But there was one house, it was within walking distance to where I worked, it was down the road from a jail, there was a hole in the floor, another on the back porch, a busted window, a missing interior door. It wasn't great, but I could have afforded it over 10 years. I was thrilled. I set up an appointment with a realtor, huge mistake. She knew my mom, called her, friendly gabbed, and my mom decided to go with me. I was a legal adult at that time, she tried to tell the realtor not to take me, I told the realtor I would go with someone else, so we went. Even though the house was messed up, some of the issues I knew how to fix, and for others, I knew a few people who could help. It would have been mine, and I would have been a huge leap closer to freedom. The realtor tried to convince me that I didn't want it, that I would want a nice apartment that would cost more monthly, I wanted the house. I filled out paperwork, one for a bank loan, gave to the realtor. I didn't know mom had asked her to wait before putting it in.

So

That night, mom hugged me and pet my arm, that gave me the creeps so bad, it still puts my stomach in knots thinking about it. I hated her false affection. It feels like cobwebs on the inside. Anyway, she bawled her eyes out. It was the hardest I've seen her cry since she got hit by her other kid, and those were the only two times I ever saw her cry like that. I fell for it. She told me not to leave her behind, she needed my help, she was going to move away from her mom, and she needed me to go with her and help with bills. I felt so bad for her. I know better now, I wish I had buckled all the way down back then. I think that was my window, I really think I missed it.

We went apartment hunting after that, of course any that I said I liked she dislike, even if she liked it first. She picked the one I hated and wasn't walking distance to my work. She said she had put papers in on it, I asked why I wasn't involved with that, she went off on me about how she doesn't owe me anything, and that I don't dictate her. So, a few weeks go by, she tells me she's leaving for a beach trip for the weekend, and that she would be back on Monday. I don't hear from her all weekend, and she didn't come home Monday. I started calling, she wasn't home Tuesday either. I called her friends, her best friend, the one who worked with abused people, chewed me out and called me a liar because she didn't believe that my mom had moved out and that she didn't tell me, and told me that I was being deceitful, and disrespectful for implying that my mom would do that. But yeah, she had moved out and in with another friend of hers. Honestly, except for the paycheck and phone issues with her, second most peaceful time in my life. 

Anyway, she cut off my phone sporadically and forbid my grandmother from helping me. I lost my job for too many days missed. I loved that job, I still miss it. I'm pretty heartbroken about that time in my life. That was the best it ever got, and if I had made better decisions, I would have been better off.

The second and last job I ever had was at another store, I was there for 7 months. Again, went behind her back for the interview, grandmother took me. I was there for 2 months before mom found out. I still don't know how she found out. Same as before, took all my pay, so I switched over to getting checks sent in the mail. My grandmother was the only one who checked the mail at the time, so I got my checks, until mom confronted her, asked her if I was getting checks in the mail, hindsight I know now that my grandmother was afraid of her too. I feel so bad. My grandmother also beat me and lied against me to make herself look good, she wasn't great, but now I know she was scared too. Anyway, my mom would take my checks, from her, do the picture deposit thing, then seal my check back up and leave it for me. I got in trouble with the bank twice, they warned me I could be charged with check fraud. So, I started picking up my check from HR day after payday. Mom cut my shit off and told grandmother not to take me to work or to use her phone. I gave my grandmother my check, had her go cash it on her own when she was running errands, and use it to buy me a prepaid phone and a card. I was able to keep getting rides to work for a while after that, I don't know how she found out about that phone. I was showering one day, and when I came out, it was gone. I went off, I searched her room, the living room, and everything I could think of. She sat there and really tried her best villain laugh, like sincerely. Big cringe. I couldn't get to work and couldn't communicate. I lost my job.

I had stashed away over $3k in my wall. That disappeared too. I just counted; I have exactly $2.71 right now. All coins, no quarters. All gift cards are gone or have been used and left empty. I had a few hundred total between money and cards just a few years ago. I used one once to buy dinner for mom when she got home from a long trip. At my first job, I got two credit cards. One was a store card, the other was a regular credit card. I was keeping up with them and building my credit, I was on top of it. When I got fired from my first job, I had less than $50 owed on each, but I had no money to pay, and no more income. So, one had a limit of $750, the other was $1,200. They maxed out on fees. When I had my second job, I was paying on both. The $750 one, I had about $80 left to pay, the $1,200 one, I had about $230 left. I couldn't finish paying. They re-maxed out. I regret so much.

In addition to my own credit faults, I know my mom has opened SEVERAL credit cards with my information. She's been doing it since I was a kid. I know she'll use her or her other kid's information in place of mine, but always my name and ssn. I've asked her to close them, got chewed out again for trying to ""dictate her."" I checked all three credit bureaus yesterday, it says I only have a hospital debt under my name. I know something's not right with that, because I know she still has a few cards in her wallet with my name on them, and I know two specifically which types of cards they are, but I don't understand why my credit report didn't show those. I don't know.

So, about driving. I don't know how to.  
I went behind her back and got my first permit in my early 20's with a different family friend who I was cleaning house for and babysitting for at the time. She took me driving a few times. She was visiting with my mom and told her, my mom cried and told her that was something special that she should get to do with me, and the family friend didn't want to take me driving anymore after that. She didn't want to get involved. Right before that permit expired, another friend started teaching me to drive (stick shift! v cool!) and when the permit did expire, he took me to renew it, gave me the money for the test. She cut off my phone when she found out I was going off with friends, so we would just make plans in person and stick to them. Well, we fell off eventually. Permit expired. Third permit I got was years later, my mom was telling everyone I refused to learn to drive. I talked my grandmother into taking me to get my test for my permit, she agreed, and she took me driving a few times. I told her I wanted to surprise mom, but I wanted to wait until I had my license. She agreed, but mom was waiting for us at home one day, I thought she had left for work already. She was pissed. She asked us where we had been, gma blurted out that we had been driving. Mom told gma that I didn't have a permit, then gma admitted that she had taken me to get one. She seethed. She didn't say anything else. My grandmother went to her room, I stayed in the living room, I was afraid to leave the room. Mom sat for a few more minutes, then got up and went to gma's room. She went off. Full on screaming, cussing, threatening. My grandmother didn't feel comfortable taking me driving after that, I did then and still do completely understand. My fourth permit, when the family friend was helping us clean, before the doctor's appointment, she had taken me to get my permit. She asked my mom when I could go driving, my mom snapped at her, and she didn't mention it again. That one expired too. 

When my mom got her diagnosis (I'll talk about this later,) she took me to get my 5th permit. The day of, in the parking lot of the DMV, she started begging me to get an ID instead, said the permit would take too long, and that she didn't feel well. I lied and said okay and got my permit anyway. She didn't speak to me for a week. Family started hounding me about not having my license, I was in my late 20's. I told them about my permit but that nobody would take me driving, mom had told my grandmother not to take me. They confronted her, she lied and told them I refused. Again, group conversation, and suddenly, progress. She agreed to pay for me to go get lessons but would only let me go through this one place. When I got there, I understood why. She was friends with the people who ran the place, and the woman scolded me and told me that my mother told her all about me. 

I would go on a driving lesson, schedule the next lesson, then I would get home, and mom would be pissed. At the time, I figured she'd find something and stew on it until I got home, now I understand it's just her issues. She would scream at me that I wasn't allowed to use her card, she would cut off my phone, she would cut off the card. Then days, weeks, or months later, she would confront me about why I hadn't been on another lesson, I would tell her about the card/phone thing, she would cut them back on if she had cut it off, then insist that it never happened. Never got enough hours. Permit expired. Went with gma to get my sixth one a few years after that. It expired a few years after that. Nobody believed me that she wouldn't let me learn to drive, everybody believes her that I was too lazy. It drives me nuts.

As far as support for me, I'm out.   
As a kid, I had lots of friends in school, but I wasn't allowed to see them outside of school. There were a few times I could, but only around my mom. When I was younger, I didn't understand why things always went bad, but looking back, I get it. She only let me have friends over or visit with friends if she could control things. She made other kids and their parents uncomfortable with being my friend. So that didn't really work until middle school, I had a friend, her mom worked in a field that overlapped with my mom's work, apparently, she knew my mom was a little off, but she played nice so I could hang out with them. I got to be friends with her until I moved. My mom had blocked her number from my account, honestly, it wasn't a priority to solve because there was so much else going on.

I had got in touch with a friend in my early 20's and stayed with her for a while, I was such an ass. I didn't help with chores. I kind of just sat or slept. She was the one who helped me get my first job. I regret not treating her and her roommates better. I picked a fight with one, I don't even remember what about, I think I shoved him, I was such a little psycho. My mom was boo-hooing at the same time that she needed me to move back with her so I did. I don't know what my problem was. I think I was anxious, waiting for something to happen, and when it didn't, I got more anxious. I wish I had been a better friend. 

As for the three family friends I knew, all of them offered to help until my mom talk to them, then they didn't want to get involved.

Dad's side of family, mom stirred shit for them, called the cops on one of their kids, called CPS on their kid, they didn't do anything wrong, made reports on them. I think in her head, it was revenge for not being bad to me? Like, proving her wrong. I haven't spoken to any of them in years, I don't even know how to get in touch. 

At my first job, made lots of friends, did well there, loved it. Once I lost my job and phone service, keeping in touch was difficult, and I couldn't afford to go anywhere, we were young adults, so being a broke flake didn't work out. Same with friends I had made outside of work. Couldn't keep in touch, couldn't afford to go anywhere. I haven't spoken to a friend in years. Second job, didn't really make friends. Kind of clocked in, I was friendly, but that place definitely felt like just a job. I still showed up and did my best. Didn't make friends outside, too much going on.

Only saw family friends a few times after that.

As far as family on her side, they just don't believe me, they don't want to get involved, and more than half of them I haven't met. One of my aunts, I've seen I think only 3 times in my life. The aunt who's closest has seen me actually getting beaten and because I fought back, I pushed O. kid off of me, I was on the ground, I was trying to put my feet up so he couldn't keep stomping on me. Because I was fighting back, she said we were both fighting. Mom had already put it in her head that I was bad. I just don't get how she saw, several times, whole attacks go down, and how she could reason with herself that something else was happening. I asked her for help yesterday on the phone, she told me she think's my mom is a wonderful person, that I need to compromise. I have no hope for getting help from family.

Grandmother, her mind's been going for years now. I have such mixed feelings about her. With the hindsight I have now, I know she was scared and putting herself first. I also know she was awful about some things. Idk if this makes sense, but since her mind has gone, I kind of just don't feel angry at her anymore. I don't talk to her really. It's been maybe two years since I talked to her. I also know now a lot of things we were angry at each other about were things mom had told us. Mom is so unfair towards gma. I feel so bad for her.  I don't have anyone else. There are 8 numbers in my phone, one is the driving instructor, one is my mother's dr.'s office.

My mom got a terminal diagnosis a few years ago. I know I shouldn't have felt this way, but I thought it was going to be my way out. I know I need a lot of help, but I really think I could make good progress if I just didn't have anybody working against me. I kept up with the chores and with helping my mom. Prior to her diagnosis, I was already doing dishes, taking out the trash, vacuuming once a month, sweeping regularly, mopping once every two months, doing household linens, sometimes helping with her laundry, cooking her meals. The only line I drew was I wouldn't clean her bathroom because the last time I had, she had laughed so hard and for so long about me cleaning her toilet, she was so giddy about humiliating me. It hurt my feeling so badly, I was just trying to help my mom out. I wouldn't clean her bathroom anymore. And I was vacuuming and dusting her room, taking out her room trash, sometimes washing her bedding and making her bed. After the diagnosis, same deal, I would do her laundry the whole time, and she decided to pay a landscaper to add in a bunch of plants and build an outdoor patio (wtf?) so I took on watering plants and sweeping/leaf blowing the patio, and cleaning patio furniture.

When she would get sick on herself, I would clean it, help her get cleaned up, clean her clothes, clean her bedding, so on. She would do this fake performance, where she always tried to make things look worse for her. They were bad, she is actually sick, but she always tried to make it worse. When she would get sick on her bed, she would want to lay on it and cry, so she could look so sad. I would make her sit in her chair so I could clean her bed, and she really resented me for that. She would TEAR out hair from her head and cry about balding, but she would call me into the room and make me stand in front of her before she did so I could see it. She would fake shake her arms, and pretend to pass out. She also decided to take up drinking and binging on junk food right after her dr told her not to do either. She was never big on either of those before. She also started using 3-5 vapes at once. Her hair's grown back now (she shaved it regularly, but it was thinning significantly,) but I can tell she has taken scissors to it and chopped at it to make it look worse. There are jagged and blunt lines that wouldn't be there if it was growing back. I don't think she has Munchausen's, I think she's just bored. She's big time a psycho. She leaves me out of the loop about her medical stuff. I either don't get told anything or get told different from what she's telling others.

She's getting better. She looks to be the same weight she was before she got sick, and her hair is about shoulder length now. I feel like it's bad to say, but this makes me feel so helpless. I really thought that would be my way out.

It's been a while since she's bough meat or produce, and it's been months since she's bought groceries I'm allowed to eat. I told her I wouldn't be doing anymore work until I had groceries and coffee. That was about a week ago, but it had been longer since I had eaten daily. I know she can afford both because she eats fast food almost every day, and buys expensive lunches for her other kid. I have been going days without eating, trying to ration what I could. I took some leftover cabbage stew out of the freezer and ate it the night before last. I had enough energy, and I had been reasoning with myself for weeks. I put in a grocery order with one of the cards that had my name on it. I got up, made a cup of tea, and got to work. She got up, and I told her I was going to catch up on the chores. and that I had put in an order. She told me she was going to mark it as fraudulent; I told her I would not do work if there was no food. She told me to go for it. I stopped working. I called my aunt. I figured if before when I had confronted her with other people and made progress, then it could work again. That's when this aunt told me she thinks my mom is wonderful, and that I need to compromise. I didn't realize it was Sunday when I called. After I got off the phone with her, I had called social services, they weren't open. I'll call again today if my phone is still on. I just feel so helpless. My worry is even if I get into programs, how many friends does this demon have!? I don't believe I'll be able to get help and that she won't interfere, and I don't believe people will believe me. I feel so lost. I feel like it's not even worth trying.

I wish I could get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee or tea, sit outside, have a light breakfast. Then do the dishes, get dressed, and go to work. I would be happy working from 10 am - 6 pm, then coming home, making a little dinner, sweeping, maybe folding some laundry. Getting a shower, putting on clean clothes. and going to sleep in a clean bed. Maybe on my days off I could meal prep, go on walks, maybe I'd have a pet. I'd light a scented candle and do some deep cleaning. Maybe I could garden. I just wish things were different. I wish I would have gone for that house. 

That's all. I feel so relieved getting to just get this all out. I've never been able to tell anyone everything before.  Ok, have a nice day, bye!",1,1760962757.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False
1obhiez,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1obhiez/how_can_i_make_this_small_corner_look_like_a/,How can I make this small corner look like a living room?,"I just moved into a new apartment, which has a small, roughly 4.5 m¬≤ space, which I want to transform into a living room.

I have currently two furniture in that space, but I don't think they look and feel good enough. Since the space is insanely small, I have no idea, if a smaller, 140 cm couch, or a bigger, maybe L-shaped 200 cm couch would be the better choice. Maybe even no couch, just two armchairs instead?

I replicated the layout in a software and I also made photos.

This is the layout of this wannabe living room space:

https://preview.redd.it/oh0szexc09wf1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=466cff0fc7ced6795a9228a2e9cc15dc16e2365a

This is the room in its current state:

https://preview.redd.it/dtuxqqvh09wf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41eaed9e9eab72f1a436f99736e909c773037263

I know that a rug, a coffee table and a curtain would give the space a more welcoming feeling, and I'll definitely buy better one of those. But as of right now, I don't think those are enough to turn this a more welcoming space.

I'm pretty sure both the current furnitures should go away, but I have honestly no idea what should I replace them with.

This is a concept I came up with:

https://preview.redd.it/dwb4xwzj39wf1.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f989ae63ef292e5a90dd2b6a855a0f8698cd99

The couch in this concept has a 140 cm width. I placed a room divider cabinet to separate this area from the other half of the room. Also placed a rug, which has the same width as the couch. The furniture on the left side remained.

Does anyone have an idea how to transform this place into a living room?",1,1760962739.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. SKIYE - Walkman [Selfreleased]**  
*Recommended if you like: Grafix, Rova, Pirapus*  

Sure, _Dimension_ came back from his incredibly long hiatus, and _Metrik_ dropped another banger single, but I'd much rather introduce a whole new character into your Dancefloor vocabulary: **SKIYE**! Pronounced sky, by the waiye. 

**1.1. This is not a drill (2002 - 2023)**

While perhaps a new name to you, Kilian Braun, residing in the gorgeous metropolis that is Vienna, has of course been around for much longer than just the couple of months that you have mayhaps heard his music being played out. Once grown out of his Pixel Gun 3D phase, he got sucked into the vortex of all things Jump Up, and before he knew it, he was producing some of it himself. In 2019, at a mere 16 years of age, his first artist alias was born: **Skydrill**. In no time at all, Kilian was flinging out disgusting dub pack after disgusting dub pack, filthy freebie after filthy freebie, and savage single after savage single on the likes of _Railbreakers_ and _Sub Motionz_, both solo and in collaborative fashion with _Envy_ (not that one), _Hamses_, _Amnesia_, and none other than _Master Error_! 

Further into the 2020s, he continued his hot streak of Jump Up bangers, adding collaborations with _Tremmor_, _Temple_, _Maurizzle_, _Noir_, _Shifu_ and _Fello_ to the murderous mix, and entering some more bootleg territory, with his reworks of _Southstar_'s 'Miss You' and _John Summit_'s 'Where You Are'. As you can perhaps already tell from those last two, his own tastes slowly but surely morphed away from his all-filth all-jump-up origins, to a more melodic place in the genre - something had to change.

**1.2. Look at the SKIYE (2024 - 2025)**

As soon as the clock struck 2024, Kilian announced his new musical venture: **SKIYE**! While his new-found love for melodic Dancefloor and even Liquid drum & bass is cited as one of the main reasons for this rebrand of his, he also assured his long-time fans that Jump Up still had a big place in his heart, and just a couple months later, he clarified just that, with the monstrous filth spewer that is _Soundwaves_. However, he still did actually go and deliver some loveliness over the next couple of months and years, through his series of _SKIYE SUMMER REMIXES_ and all sorts of reworks of classic bangers like _Say My Name_, or new ones like _Where You Are_. 

While already rather successful with these, especially when it came to streaming numbers, he still hadn't quite cracked the code to get his music played out by DJs - but that changed pretty quickly. Not only has he crossed the threshold from banging bootleggery to lovely originals with his contributions on Liquicity's _Ridmic_ and _DnB Allstars_' recent _Size Up_ compilation, earlier this year his bootleg of _John Summit_'s 'light years' could also be heard all over the world, thanks to support by none other than _Kanine_ and _Delta Heavy_. I took a clip of that one at Let It Roll, because I thought it was a new Delta Heavy banger! 

Now, we celebrate the arrival of yet another DJ favourite: **Walkman**!

**1.3. Walkman**

Teased in an ID showcase post back in April, and played out by more DJs than I could care to count while scrolling through Kilian's _Tagged In_ tab, **Walkman** is perhaps his biggest tune yet. Merging his Jump Up sensibilities, here brought to life via the senses-overwhelming squelch, the simple yet effectively commanding vocal snippets, and the forward-driving drum action, with his new-found melodic streak and the all-around modern sound we got going on, in this case represented by the bassy yet euphoric vocal response to all the above, Walkman walks the fine line between filthy and beautiful rather perfectly... man! 

**1.4. Conclusion**

Large, dramatic and all-around epic, while also stupidly filthy, squelchy, and bassface-coercing - it's a SKI-YES from me.

Other bangers from this week:  
- KRITIKAL - Gangsta Life VIP  
- Dimension - Hardest D Style EP  
- Various Artists - Future Fire Vol.8 (Viper Presents)  
- NVADRZ & ALIAS - Bye Bye

####**2. Xtinctor, Jakke Chase - Wide Awake [Automata Music]**  
*Recommended if you like: Delirium., DETECX, Onetral*  

Hola! ... I'll stop any further attempts at Spanish from myself right then and there. Instead, let's honour the wonderful, supremely underrated drum & bass music coming from the iberian peninsula, especially as of late, with a spotlight of Barcelonian up-and-comers **Xtinctor** and **Jakke Chase**, and their collaborative banger on the one and only **Automata Music**! 

**2.1. Xtinctor**

The first xciting new name from the Head and Hearth of Catalonia I intend to introduce to you is Javier Lara Bellido, better known as **Xtinctor**! While his mom still thinks he does 'Yoga music', his background actually takes us into the wide realms of EDM. Since 2019, he dabbled in everything from Tech and Future House to Pop-y EDM, either self-releasing or working with Spanish labels like _CHARGE RCRDS_, and earning himself support by names like _Pink Panda_, _TripleM_, _Uri Farre_, _Danny Valen_, _Pepe Cano_. With more experience came more opportunities to work with other artists like _Azzer_, _Skyles_, _L3ss_, _Artesimo_, _Lanova_ and _Toxic Wraith_, and through his bootleg work he even managed to snag an upload to the legendary _Future House Music_ channel! Further along, he used his tune reworking talents to participate in remix competitions for _Kryder_ and _Matteo Lika_, the latter of which he actually emerged victorious from! 

The bigger his network grew, the more he wanted to bring all the talented people he knew together, and showcase what they are all capable of. So in 2024, he and a few friends (we'll get to that) created **Underdogs TV**! Through weekly mix uploads to their YouTube channel, and lots of behind-the-scenes and -decks footage, the platform consistently gives glimpses into Spain's electronic music scene, and with their **Rave Lab** event series, they even put on their own shows - with a bit of an experimental touch. 

So what does any of this have to do with DnB, you ask? Well, it turns out 2024 was also the year of a bigger shift in Javier's sound. Inspired by _Fox Stevenson_ and spurred on even further by Automata's _BALA_, he not only bootlegged _Bad Bunny_ into DnB, but released his debut on the fresh Spanish label, **Lullaby**! Deciding to go all-in on the drums and the basses, Javier has since then gone on to put his own spin on tunes by _Zedd_, _Aitana_ and _NBC9_, work together with Japanese talent _YASUKI_ and fellow Spaniards _Lexed_ and _Jrace & Albert White_, and release on labels like _Play Me_ and even _DnB Allstars_, while simultaneously becoming one of _Automata_'s core members and sharing the stage with _Andromedik_, _Futurebound_, _Freaks & Geeks_ and more! Oh and one more thing: His debut _Lullaby_ was remixed by a certain _Jakke Chase_, I wonder who that is.

**2.2. Jakke Chase**

Oh yeah, right! Similar to Javier, the backstory of fellow Barcelonian producer Arnau Abadia Quinto, aka **Jakke Chase**, is _steeped_ in explorations of all things EDM and House. Whether it was his bootleggery of _Laidback Luke_, _Felix Jaehn_, _D3EPANK_, _Zhou_, or the _Wii Sports_ theme, or his various, numerous originals on the likes of _Sick Bedroom Records_ (what a name), _Jandex_, and _CHARGE RCRDS_, Arnau has been delivering _constant_ musical goodness since kicking off this journey in 2018. Come 2022, he expanded his genre repertoire further and further, with both Future Bass and Future House entering the fold on imprints like _Chill Planet_ and _TURNT_ (only great label names today), but in 2023, most of his sonic adventures were distributed by himself - and featured his very own singing voice! Always keeping the sonic evolution going throughout his prolific life as an artist, Arnau also tried his hands at Stutter House, before finally becoming a massive UK Garage head earlier this year. Fun fact, he was also one of 10 Spanish artists to attend Martin Garrix's _JBL Music Academy_! 

Outside of purely discographic evolution, however, he was also growing his network of artist friends, like when he met this guy called **Xtinctor** back in 2020! That's right, you probably figured it out by now: Arnau was another one of the friends who founded **Underdogs TV** together. As such, it only made sense that he would join in on the _Automata_ fun and remix Javier's debut, _Lullaby_, into his first-ever DnB tune - with his second having followed this very week. So let's dive into that!

**2.3. Wide Awake**

Screaming our way into the experience, **Wide Awake** does to our minds what the title promises if this one comes on in shuffle mode, but we quickly go back to soothing atmospheric work, where various vocalisations float through our mental sky, while the sunny synths begin to swell. Sooner rather than later, the vocal takes on a more coherent form, building up the melodic hype further and further, until the duo unleashes the star of the show: the fluttery, stuttery, futuristic synth line! With a little bit of boom-tschack and roaring bass, you don't need much more to make the heart a-flutter. As the vocal commands it, we are being taken higher, up a couple of energy levels and keys at least, in the delayed second drop, putting a most wonderful cap on this short but sweet journey of a tune.

**2.4. Conclusion**

Uniquely uplifting, delivered by two artists and one label you ought to be paying more attention to.

Other techy vibes from this week:  
- Various Artists - 10 Years of Soulvent: The Remixes  
- Revolve - Underburn / The Tower üíé  
- LoveTheEND - You Know How üíé  
- Eth:er - Tempus üíé

1obhhf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1obhhf3/i_think_i_want_to_be_a_janitor/,I think I want to be a janitor,"I‚Äôve worked a lot of different jobs, all of them dealing with the public or people in some way. I worked at a school, a daycare, a before/after school program. I‚Äôve bartended, waitressed, and worked at coffee shops as a barista. Now I‚Äôm a licensed hairdresser and after working at a salon for a few months I‚Äôve decided that while I love doing hair, I really dislike people :( 

When I worked at the school I was always jealous of the custodians there, because they got to answer calls and just clean, fix things, and mind their business. I‚Äôm a very fast and thorough cleaner and always have been. Pretty much every job I‚Äôve had (aside from the school) lacked custodians which meant I had to do a laundry list of cleaning in addition to my more social job duties. The cleaning part was always very peaceful to me and gave me solace from having to talk to other people. 

I grew up with social anxiety due to autism which makes it hard for me to read people and know what they‚Äôre thinking. I‚Äôve learned how to compensate and mask extremely well, but I‚Äôm just exhausted and burnt out with it. I‚Äôd love a job that plays to my strengths instead of having to constantly compensate for my shortcomings. 

I‚Äôm also at the point where I‚Äôm turning 26 and I need a job that offers benefits. Hairdressing jobs that offer health and dental are very scarce. Even if I did janitorial work full time and just did hair on the side, that would be fine. But the health insurance is particularly important to me because I need constant help with my mental health. I‚Äôd also prefer a job that‚Äôs more physical than mental so I still have the mental bandwidth to write when I get home, as writing fiction is sort of my special interest and I get very upset when I can‚Äôt do it daily. 

tl;dr am I correct in assuming a custodian/janitor is a good job for an introvert? How do I find a job as a school custodian ? ",2,1760962665.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm Marco, 30M from Italy, and I‚Äôll be moving to Finland soon for work (Oulu, to be exact!).

This is Chapter 5 in An Entity Unmatched, a ballad about Tony Aldy's quest to avenge Kobe Bryant's death and win NBA championships for the Los Angeles Lakers

...

At the Staples Center for Game 1 of the Lakers' first-round series in the 2018 NBA Playoffs against the Memphis Grizzlies, LA‚Äôs home crowd nearly fainted all at once when Tony Aldy charged out of the tunnel on camelback while firing his musket at rival fans in the crowd, killing at least seven. It was his first return to the actual stadium in months.¬†

‚ÄúI was an absentee father,‚Äù he announced to the stadium after pushing the usual public address announcer out of the way to take over his microphone. ‚ÄúAnd I am so sorry, y‚Äôall. But the time has come to raise another banner, and there are NO lines I will not cross to repeat as NBA champions!‚Äù¬†

Fans went delirious as Tony blew steam out of his ears and made the noise of a locomotive horn before announcing the starting lineups himself, taking on the role of showrunner this evening.¬†‚ÄòPraise the Lord‚Äô by A$AP Rocky played while Aldy danced at midcourt with the basketball as fans chanted his name. Once the music cut out, Aldy locked in and pushed the referee out of the way so he could also throw the opening tip.¬†

At the end of the third quarter, Los Angeles led Memphis by 100 points while the Laker starting lineup debated the ethics of Socrates‚Äô defining work on the bench for much of the fourth quarter en route to a win. After a Game 2 that was eerily similar, the teams headed for Memphis.¬†

Stephen A. Smith was ESPN's lead reporter on the series but had serious qualms about traveling to Memphis, since the New York City native was horrified about the crime rate in the southwestern Tennessee city. Tony saw an opportunity.¬†He invited Setphen A. Smith and special guest President Trevor Amback to a Memphis barbecue joint with him the night before Game 3 and imparted some wisdom.¬†

‚ÄúSix pulled pork sammies,‚Äù Aldy thundered to the kitchen staff before he even walked in the building. ‚ÄúOn rolls,‚Äù he emphasized as he shoved the double doors open with such force that they flew off the hinges. ‚ÄúWhoops.‚Äù 

The three men sat in a booth at Aldy‚Äôs direction.¬†

‚ÄúLook, man, I govern my own city-state now, you know, and it‚Äôs true what they say,‚Äù Aldy told Smith. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs important in life until you have one of your own.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I know it,‚Äù commented President Amback.

‚ÄúI say all this to say,‚Äù continued Aldy, ‚Äúthat crime is an inevitable threat in the fabric of urban American life. I always say around my town, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre scared of the criminals, then become one.‚Äô‚Äù

Aldy ate his two large pulled pork sandwiches in one bite apiece and belched loud enough to break a few windows in nearby businesses. He then stood up, whispered something in Smith‚Äôs ear, slapped him on the back hard enough to force the 54-year-old to slip a disk, and waltzed out of the BBQ joint. Amback nodded and walked out as well.¬†

Smith would reflect on that meeting for the rest of his life.¬†

Grizzlies star Mike Conley got carried away in Game 3 of the first-round series and racked up 20 points before halftime, but Aldy and Huggins game-planned a tremendous solution out of the break. Seth Goodwin made a phobic remark to an offended party to ignite a courtside riot, which Aldy used as an excuse to seek out Conley.¬†

Rob Pelinka tried feebly to bring peace to the scuffle and spotted Aldy‚Äôs sinister scowl across the court. He followed him and found the Laker head man stalking Mike Conley. Aldy noticed Pelinka and yanked him forward by the ear, telling him that it was ‚Äúhigh time to learn about the true tactics behind winning basketball.‚Äù

Pelinka froze up and watched as Aldy grabbed hold of Conley‚Äôs right calf, took three gluttonous bites out of it, and then somersaulted through a different pair of legs to disappear like a snake in the grass, leaving the Memphis guard in total confusion and terrible pain.¬†

Without Conley, the Grizzlies‚Äô spirit was broken, and more riots broke out in the stadium during the second half. After a narrow Game 3 win and a blowout first half in Game 4 for the Lakers, many of the Memphis players and coaches were abducted mid-game by fans and tortured or sold into the underground trans-arctic slave trade.

In his series recap, Stephen A. Smith wrote beautifully about the stark contrast of a weak-tempered city beneath its hard shell of defiance.

After sacking the city of Memphis and leaving it behind in total ruin, the Lakers‚Äô Winnebago fleet raced back home, where they would prepare to meet the Houston Rockets in the conference semifinals. The Rockets hadn‚Äôt attempted a 2-point shot all season long, which flummoxed Aldy and Huggins during their film sessions.¬†

Nigel Williams-Goss really stepped up in this series, holding James Harden to 77 points in Game 1 while scoring seven of his own to lead the Lakers to a 101‚Äì100 victory. But Houston missed zero shots in Game 2 and squeaked out a win to even up the score heading back to their home.¬†

‚ÄúI think Tony Aldy was asleep at the wheel that last game, Ernie,‚Äù Charles Barkley commented on the inconsistent Lakers ahead of Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals during the TNT pregame show.¬†

‚ÄúAnd LeBron can be the best player on the floor whenever he wants to be. He just has to want to be tonight,‚Äù added Shaq.¬†

‚ÄúI think sometimes we put too much stock in one game,‚Äù said Kenny Smith. ‚ÄúLike, the Rockets did not miss in Game 2. It‚Äôs hard to beat a team who doesn‚Äôt miss. Let‚Äôs just see if Los Anegeles comes out tonight with a different level of aggressiveness.‚Äù

The Lakers won 245‚Äì13 and Aldy launched his own cryptocurrency coin that night titled ‚ÄúLAKERKOIN,‚Äù backed heavily by investors from Monaco.¬†

Game 4 went the way of Houston, though, and Aldy banished two of the Dartmouth boys after they had suggested the losing strategy of allowing James Harden to shoot every 3, guarding only the other four players. Harden scored 145 points.¬†

Game 5 was back in Adlylantis, and funny enough, the score was tied at 5‚Äì5 heading into the fourth quarter. Houston had wide-open layups all day but refused to take them, while the Lakers were just ice cold but hanging in thanks to a red-hot run of defensive adjustments by Bob Huggins. Meanwhile, LeBron James commanded the offense, which was broken, until Max Robespierre found the secret sauce: offensive rebounds.

Mattingly and Robespierre couldn‚Äôt hit the broad side of a barn with their shot attempts, but the duo were undeniable on the offensive glass, gathering enough second attempts to offset their hauntingly low shooting percentage.¬†

The Rockets only fired off four shots all night and missed their last one with 6:19 to play. LA bricked shot after shot after shot, until LeBron finally soared for a magnificent putback slam dunk to win the game with 34 seconds left. James Harden literally could not be found anywhere in the arena on the final possession, leading to a poor Houston shot choice, defensive stop, and an LA win.¬†

The result left Aldy completely satisfied but boiling with stress. He could not stomach another call that close in this tight series, so he relied on President Amback for an emergency favor.¬†

Mattingly won the tip-off in Game 6. Nigel Williams-Goss corralled it and flung an immediate shot from near mid-court, which went in. Tony pump-faked and bellowed, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù¬†

He then ordered his team to flee the court. A packed and confused arena watched the Laker players make like bandits toward the tunnel, racing back to their locker room, where a trap door had been installed and allowed them to sneak into an underground tunnel system.¬†

Upstairs, the public address announcer inside the Toyota Center guessed wildly at what had just happened. Before fans could even stand up, celebrity fighter pilot Trevor Amback and a line of stealth bombers zipped over the Texan skies and launched ballistic missiles at the Houston arena, incinerating it in a matter of seconds.¬†

‚ÄúSorry, we thought a most-wanted terrorist was located in the arena,‚Äù Amback explained from the White House press room during his address to the nation later that evening.¬†

‚ÄúWho was the terrorist? Was the target eliminated?‚Äù one reporter asked.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all very classified, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúThank you, everyone, goodnight, and God bless Texas.‚Äù

The Arizona Cardinals awaited the Lakers in the next round but decided to forfeit the Western Conference Finals after Amback‚Äôs stunt and pulled out of the NBA altogether, joining the NFL instead to avoid any future political scrutiny.¬†

Tony Aldy was never more relaxed or confident as head man. Bob Huggins ran an air-tight ship, Mattingly captained the lads with true courage, and the team hit its stride with a defensive identity and LeBron James still producing 12 assists a night as the silver fox point-forward. All while Rick Pitino, Dave Ramsey and Delilah brought along the magnificent Aldylantis project according to schedule.¬†

Thanks to Arizona's departure, Los Angeles had a week off to rest before heading to Wisconsin for Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals against, yet again, the Milwaukee Bucks. 

Prior to tip-off of the first game, Tony grabbed a beer from the concession stand and hustled up to the ESPN pre-game show for a surprise cameo, especially shocking given his Revolutionary War getup and wig.¬†

‚ÄúSo Tony, how has this team really come together since that disappointing start to the year?‚Äù asked pre-game show host Malika Andrews.¬†

‚ÄúDisappointing?‚Äù he accused Andrews.¬†

‚ÄúI meant‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNonsense. You're right. It was pitiful dishonor for our city-state,‚Äù Aldy answered.¬†

‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù mused Stephen A. Smith, who hurled his question toward Aldy.¬†

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the secret sauce behind this huge run, man?‚Äù

Aldy swallowed and cleared his throat.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm having more fun doing less coaching this year,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the seat leaned all the way back, one finger guiding the steering wheel. I‚Äôm just hardly managing a well-oiled machine, Stephen.‚Äù

Aldy went to give a friendly smack to Smith‚Äôs back, but Smith dove to the side and fell off his chair, slipping his other disk in the process.¬†

The Laker head man drank his beer to completion as he continued to charm the ESPN set before backflipping out of his seat and onto the court just moments ahead of Lil Uzi Vert‚Äôs National Anthem performance.

Huggins felt the damp current of Aldy‚Äôs breath mid-rage as the Laker head man berated him for a poor defensive showing in the first quarter. One-legged Chris Early, who had been nicknamed the ‚ÄòPogo Stick,‚Äô was eating the old and tired LeBron James alive out on the wing.¬†

‚ÄúFor a nation built on defense, we aren‚Äôt guarding for SQUAT!‚Äù Aldy shrieked into Huggins‚Äô face for the entire bench to hear. Milwaukee fans in the front row were amazed at Aldy‚Äôs command of the sideline, with one older lady commenting that he had the ‚Äúdazzle of a philharmonic conductor.‚Äù

In order to spark renewed spirit during the halftime break with the Lakers down by 10, Tony flooded the tunnel path to the locker room so he could lead his men back onto the court in a mimic of American general George Washington crossing the Delaware River in 1776 during the Revolutionary War.¬†

A huge history buff, Dave Ramsey was moved by this gesture and took off like a Gulfstream jet once he hit the hardwood. His pick-and-roll opportunities with Luis Scola went remarkably well as the Lakers stormed towards a comeback but simply ran out of time, notching the loss. Aldy was oddly calm in the postgame.¬†

‚ÄúI wish I was angry but I‚Äôm just not,‚Äù he insisted, staying late to sign fan autographs and candidly answer questions with genuine engagement from the crowd around him. Seven and a half hours after the game had ended, Tony yawned and collapsed on the bleachers, asking not to be woken up until the next afternoon.¬†

Before Game 2, Tony was visited by two ghosts, the first being that of Kobe Bean Bryant. Bryant appeared in the form of a mummy at the foot of Aldy‚Äôs 30 x 20-foot bed in his Airbnb. The Laker head man was startled but watched intently as the mummified figure began to unravel his linen, revealing the face of Kobe. Aldy cried at once.¬†

Bryant explained to Aldy that his nonchalance was unacceptable at this stage of the playoffs. ‚ÄúBig man,‚Äù he told his friend, ‚Äúremember when you karate-chopped that sliding glass door in my hotel room two years ago and insisted that I play with confidence?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Aldy huffed.¬†

‚ÄúWe need that energy,‚Äù warned Bryant as he disappeared into a mist.¬†

The other ghost arrived in the form of a deceased Rockets fan begging for his life back after the senseless drone strike in Houston. Aldy woke up refreshed.¬†

As the lads prepared for Game 2, Tony pulled Rick Pinito aside and informed him that he‚Äôd need to return to the sidelines for the rest of the Finals, putting his sheriff duties in Aldylantis on hold. ‚ÄúAnything for you, my liege,‚Äù Pitino promised.¬†

With Pitino and Huggins masterminding the game plan, Aldy could focus on sheer motivation. He screamed at players with the full might of his wrath after small errors but also engineered inspiring acts.¬†

For instance, midway through the second quarter of Game 2, Mattingly was pushed from behind during a rebound but did not earn a whistle. The peaceful warrior archetype, Mattingly took the missed call in stride and hustled back on defense. But Aldy saw an opportunity to stand up for his men in a heroic display of public backing.¬†

He dove down on all fours and huffed like a bull, swiping his leg back several times as a wind-up before charging straight at the official who missed the call. Aldy broke the referee‚Äôs back in four places with the immediate impact of his tackle and proceeded to snap the ref‚Äôs left arm in a way that would be challenging to ever recover from after the ref answered that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù reverse a non-foul call.¬†

Security at the Fiserv Forum did nothing, knowing their fates would be sealed if they tried to interrupt Aldy‚Äôs violent act. But Adam Silver had his personal NBA SWAT team called in, who tried their best to subdue Aldy.

‚ÄúIt was like trying to tackle an Ox,‚Äù one trooper shared in the post-arrest press conference.¬†

Aldy thrashed and roared, inflicting lifelong brain trauma to several troopers with strikes to their heads from his gargantuan paws. Eventually, the wild beast was tranquilized and removed from the arena, then transferred to California to be caged in the maximum security dungeon that was built for Aldylantis‚Äô own prisoners, where Tony would patiently await the Lakers‚Äô Game 3 at home.¬†

Mattingly was deeply moved by Aldy‚Äôs self-sacrifice over a trivial non-call in the first half of the second of seven potential games in the series. He kissed Aldy on the forehead before he was yanked away and vowed to pull out a Los Angeles win.¬†

Fading out of consciousness and being restrained by an entire SWAT team, Tony Aldy looked Mattingly dead in the eyes as he was dragged back into the tunnel and said‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúI know you will, son, and I‚Äôm proud of you‚Äù‚Äîbefore his eyes closed and his tongue fell out of his mouth, flapping in the wind as he was transported to his restrictive chambers.¬†

It was a hero‚Äôs exit.¬†

Thank God for Rick Pitino, though. With Bob Huggins scared to step up and lead the huddle in a big moment, Pitino silenced him and took over as acting head man, refocusing the team around one mission: ‚ÄúThis one for Tony.‚Äù¬†

Mattingly was possessed for the rest of the game and scored every single time he touched the basketball while Kevin Durant tried his best to match him on the other end but failed on the Bucks‚Äô final possession of the game, allowing a 104‚Äì102 Laker victory‚Ä¶ all in the name of Tony Aldy of course.¬†

Tony always wondered about society beyond Aldylantis‚Äô 800-foot-tall iron perimeter and figured that most forms of intelligent life adored him as some sort of Christ-like figure, while he adored Kobe Bryant as such. The night of Game 2 provided opportunity for such thoughts, and Aldy left his dungeon cell and entered a cosmic meditative state, reflecting with much prayer and fasting following Kobe‚Äôs impromptu visit from the spiritual realm the other night.¬†

Ideals of zeal, bloodthirst, and divinity danced in Tony‚Äôs head during his preparation for Game 3. He woke up at 3:00 AM the day of the matchup and had a funny feeling. Laughing to himself, Tony adorned himself with a Belarusian robe and wobbled out into the sharp morning sunlight after finally being let out of the dungeon.¬†

He was absorbed by the morning fog and transmorphed into a gaseous state for a grand total of seven minutes. During those brief 420 seconds, Aldy saw the future play out in front of him in the form of this vision:  

*Tony's lifeless body flew off the top of his home pyramid while his severed head thudded on the ground loud enough to wake up every family in the city-state. A few moments later, Chris Early had finally finished stabbing Aldy‚Äôs head onto a metal probe, which he then attached to what remained of his severed left thigh. Tony Aldy‚Äôs head was fastened as some sort of makeshift shoe for Early, who planted both of his legs, one real and one mechanical, into the ground for the first time in more than two years. Out from behind the shadows, Nigel Williams-Goss emerged, dropping to his knees to make out with Aldy‚Äôs severed head as a form of worship to Early, who smiled.*

After the gortesque vision, Aldy found himself inside of his in-home elevator, where he eventually cooled to a liquid state and hardened up into his solid human form over the next 93 minutes, all while wallowing in the agonies of the future he had just seen. Storm clouds raged all around the doors to Aldy's home, which caused him to think to himself: *I might not take ittttt anymoooooore.* 

Deliliah cartwheeled into an elevator, where she found her husband shriveled up and pleading for the afterlife to exist. She heard a moan and a chewing noise and yanked Tony to his knees, catching him smack in the middle of gorging on hallucinogenic mushrooms. His face was washed in tears and his eyes red-ringed and bulging like overstuffed balloons. 

""You set my heart a-reeling, babe!"" he cried out to Delilah, who pulled away and spun back out of the chamber as its doors started to close. Tony tripped after her, from his toes up to his ears, and splattered onto the elevator floor, his left hand flopping towards the elevator doorway, where it clanged to the ground. The door severed three of Tony's fingers clean off as it snapped shut ‚Äî his index, middle and ring fingers on his left paw. That's because Tony had specifically designed the ground-floor elevator to close like a guillotine in case he was on the run from bad guys on foot and needed an escape. 

Blood erupted from his hand and he howled a mighty howl in Delilah's direction, blowing her backward and knocking her unconscious with its force. Aldy cursed that he'd just incapacitated his only ride to a hospital and instead called the Lakers team doctors and demanded emergency medical attention via helicopter. 

Once Dr. San Gallee arrived, Tony punched him in the face with his mangled left hand to let the doctor know exactly what he's dealing with. San Gallee and his fleet of nurses attempted to subdue and tranquilize Aldy, but he roared past every shot of anesthesia with almost no impact, a phenomenon that confounded medical experts around the world. Aldy was so wired from these drug binges that he literally shattered his teeth while grinding them at the doctor's office.

Death began to flash in his mind again, and he felt he could almost smell Chris Early. That evil son of a bitch. Tony finally reflected on the morning's vision and could not believe he didn't see the signs with this Chris Early fellow earlier. Of course... ""Never trust a man who's leg you cut off, for he's likely sworn himself to revenge upon you."" That was a verse in Tony's new mental bible. 

As Tony finally faded out of consciousness, he entered complete psychedelia. He next opened his eyes under a pine tree as tall as Mt. Everest. Kobe Bryant's ghost reappeared while the Moody Blues song 'Night in White Satin' played from an unknown source atop the tree, echoing out to Bryant and Aldy below. ""We must climb,"" Kobe insisted. 

Aldy and Kobe ascended up a never-ending tree trunk as a bald eagle screamed into Tony's face that he'd reached 40,000 feet of elevation and would now begin to suffer oxygen depletion to his brain. Aldy screeched like a banshee and tried to scamper even faster up the tree as 'Nights in White Satin' crescendoed. But when Tony peered downward again, Kobe's ghost had turned into a sleek panther that was gaining on him with remarkable ease. As Tony's heart pounded and expanded, tearing through his skin, the final notes of 'Nights in White Satin' shredded his eardrums and he barreled head-first into the top of the pine tree as white light flashed around him. 

Days after his elevator slip-up, Tony Aldy awoke to the smell of a fresh cup of coffee. Dr. San Gallee informed him that his heart was stopped and he was put into a coma to solve his hand issue, which was now totally repaired. For other reasons, Aldy could not believe his eyes. 

Chris Early was not more than 25 yards away from his hospital bed. The Milwaukee Bucks star and moonlighting fire chief was hob-knocking with Aldy's constituents like he was a made member of the Aldylantis boys club. He rubbed Rick Pitino's feet and shared several bottles of Bohemia-style beer with Bob Huggins. He grabbed Delilah's ass and teased Nigel Williams-Goss over his pitiful defense of both of Milwaukee's press break this year and Early's prison break the previous season. Ahead of a crucial NBA Finals Game 3, Bucks star Chris Early was socially cucking Lakers head man Tony Aldy. 

It's on, folks.

1obh96b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1obh96b/what_is_causing_these_symptoms_that_suddenly/,What is causing these symptoms that suddenly reappeared???,"I've been on HRT for 4 years and it has been good. Not great, but good.  Last month was officially a year since my last period. Suddenly a few months ago I've started to feel like crap: depressed, SEVERE irritability that is about to cost me my job, starving constantly and craving sugar, horrible body aches, no sex drive, night sweats, low energy, itchiness, more.

The things that have changed that I wonder caused this:

1. My .075 patches have been different brands every month for the last 6 months. Currently Sandoz. I think Dotti was the best, but can never get it now.

2. My prescriber lowered me from 300 to 100 dose of oral progesterone. He said testing showed I was too high. (a different Dr had upped me to 300)

3. I stopped taking Cod liver oil as it's too expensive (I was using Rosita which was almost 100/month)

4. I'm drinking more coffee because I always feel tired and no energy

5. My diet has been crappy due to the terrible cravings. Prior to about last April, I was eating healthy the majority of the time.

6. I stopped exercising almost completely due to knee/back pain. Seeing  a PT as of last week. I used to be a gym rat

7. Working more hours at a physical job that I hate, due to being laid off last year

I am considering doing HRT pellets so that I can stop playing the ""which patch will I get this month"" game. However, insurance doesn't pay for it and I feel I'll be stuck for 3 months if it doesn't help. Also considering a GLP to help with diet.

Has anyone else been doing well and suddenly the symptoms come back? TIA

1obh8eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1obh8eq/coffee_was_my_daily_comfort_until_i_realized_it/,Coffee was my daily comfort until I realized it was slowly destroying me,"I keep seeing posts every week about people with HIT (or MCAS) and their struggle with coffee. They know it‚Äôs hurting them, but they can‚Äôt quite let it go. I get it, I‚Äôve been there too.   
  
It‚Äôs a tricky business. On one hand, MCAS and HIT make us tired. So we reach for coffee to get through the day. On the other hand, coffee triggers flares and makes the whole situation worse. And because coffee is addictive, it‚Äôs incredibly hard to quit. It becomes a vicious cycle.

I‚Äôve tried to quit many times. Sometimes I made it for a few days or weeks. But I always came back. Until recently, when I finally stopped for good.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I wish someone had told me how bad it can get over time. At first, coffee just made my symptoms a bit worse, uncomfortable but manageable. But as the years went by, it pushed my system into total breakdown mode. Especially in the evenings, my body felt like it was collapsing from the inside. It‚Äôs hard to describe, I wasn‚Äôt actually dying, but my body felt like it was on the edge of shutting down every minute. I also developed severe anxiety and felt constantly close to a panic attack (even though it never happened).

Every time I quit coffee, those intense symptoms improved within days. But every time I went back, it all came crashing down again.

After 16 years of living with HIT/MCAS, I can say from my own experience: coffee is one of the major triggers, at least for me, and it gets worse over time, not better. So my honest advice is: quit it, especially at the beginning, or at least until you have your system somewhat stable. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just making everything harder for yourself. For those who want to quit, I highly recommend a book called The Easy Way to Quit Caffeine (Allen Carr).

It‚Äôs the same method I used to quit alcohol too (that‚Äôs a whole other story).

I‚Äôm not affiliated with the author in any way, it was just the only approach that actually worked for me. Because with willpower alone, I couldn‚Äôt do it.",2,1760961910.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

1obh7vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1obh7vq/last_night_i_just_walked_away_from_a_good_man_who/,"Last night, I just walked away from a good man who wasn't right for me and can't stop crying. Asking for comfort.","I had been with him for 9 months until today. It was not long, but I cared deeply. I wanted us to succeed. I wanted to love, and to be loved. Last night I ended it, or maybe we both did, because we agreed it was best for us to move on separately. We parted with respect and kindness.

It began beautifully. From the first moment, we felt drawn to each other. Both physically and intellectually. But with time we saw how different we were. What first attracted us did not work in real life.

We are both intelligent and accomplished, but he is a workaholic. I admired his mind and his abstract way of thinking. Yet I am someone who feels deeply and needs to connect through emotion. I wanted to share my heart, to speak openly, to let him into my world, and to be let into his. But I felt him keeping a distance. I felt as if he could not share himself, as if he was somewhere behind a wall I could never reach.

He wanted an intellectual equal who could spend every day talking about politics, business, and philosophy. I enjoy those conversations, but I also need tenderness, warmth, and emotional closeness. Without that, even our intimacy felt disconnected. I never felt truly close to him during sex. It is hard to explain. I saw him trying, really trying, but it always felt as if his mind was elsewhere.

We tried living together for the last 4 months. I love tidiness and creating a home that feels cozy and peaceful. He never cared for that world. He preferred reading, learning, or working. I loved him sharing with me what he's read or learnt, but I felt alone in domestic work. He had two lovely dogs I adored, but it was difficult when they jumped on the freshly changed white sheets with muddy paws. He allowed them to do anything, while I wanted to keep our space calm and clean. I loved them too, but I often felt uncomfortable.

He was generous and successful, and we had a comfortable life in his house. He donated to charity organizations and volunteered at a university in his free time. I admired his dedication. Yet he was also drawn to status symbols that never mattered much to me. I like quality things, but I would not buy a Range Rover or a Jaguar just to fit in or to drive future children in the best cars.

I am someone who enjoys my daily hikes. He loved his time with coffee and books. I loved going to my dance classes and wished we could dance, laugh and have fun together at least once, but he never joined. It was not his world. Instead, he volunteered in the military and enjoyed shooting, while I have always been frightened by those sounds. I love a good laugh, be it a funny little meme or silly joke. Why not if it makes this world even a 0.1% happier place. He didn't share that with me. I found his political caricatures way too serious and sometimes boring.

I live actively and value health. He did not care much, and it broke my heart to see his body show the cost of his lifestyle at 40, he needed certain medications. I am 40 too, though I often joke that it was my 25th birthday plus 15. He looked and felt older. He often said, half laughing, that he would not stay long on this planet. He often joke that it was his 55th birthday minus 15. His father died at 50, and he believed he would too because... genetics. It always made me ache inside, because it is definitely a lifestyle issue, too.

He used to say I lived my life beautifully, that he was drawn to my microcosmos. Those were the things he admired but never shared. I was amazed by his intellect and ambition, but we lived on different frequencies. Soon it became clear that living together did not make us happy. I grew sad and restless. He, with his 2 PhDs, longed for someone who could leave everything aside and talk endlessly about war conflicts, politics or educational matters. I could not give him that as much as he wanted, and he felt he was not enough for me either.

We tried, we truly did. For the last few months we spoke more and more about whether we were right for each other. Today we had our final conversation. I took my things from his place, and he drove me back to the apartment I had left 4 months ago to move in with him. He dropped me off gently and respectfully, without bitterness.

Before we said goodbye, he looked at me and said softly, ‚ÄúWell, this is it, the end of our mutual journey‚Äù. We hugged and thanked each other for everything beautiful we shared. I thanked him for the deep and thoughtful conversations I rarely have with anyone else. He thanked me for letting him into my microcosmos. We agreed that maybe one day we will talk again as friends, but not too soon. We both need time to heal. I respect that deeply. I have never had such a breakup before.

Now I am sitting here, crying. I probably didn't make a mistake, yet the pain is so sharp and heavy. He is a good man, but we could not live happily together. Not now. I remember our beautiful first date which was us all day walking in my favorite city parts showing him its gems, I was relaxed and happy. He was relaxed and happy, too. We came back to my place, drank wine until 4 and went to sleep in different bedrooms. It was such a beautiful Friday, we both took it as a day off, then spent the entire weekent together. We gave it our best, and still it was not enough. I had high hopes, thought ""this might be it"". I thought this might be my chance to build a family, but it was not meant to be. Even so, I am proud of myself. In the past I would have left slowly, piece by piece, or escaped into another relationship. This time I stayed present. I faced the truth and let it break me open. It hurts deeply, but I know this is probably the way forward.

I am grateful for what we had. I saw what healthy, respectful communication looks like. It may be the bare minimum in relationships, but it is rare in this day and age. I learned that love alone is not always enough. I learned how to treat someone I love with care, and how to let go with grace, knowing we both deserve better. Perhaps.

Today I said goodbye to a wonderful man whose ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and ‚Äúnight night‚Äù made my life gentler. I will miss that more than I can say. Yet I am thankful that I loved. I am thankful that I learned. And I am ready to face the pain, to heal, and to move on. I know, this may have sounded way too poetic for Reddit, but I wanted to leave it here. It's how I'm feeling.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here and crying. Did I make a mistake? I probably didn‚Äôt. So why does it hurt so much? I know he‚Äôs a good man, but we couldn‚Äôt live happily together. Did we really try everything we could? I had such high hopes at the beginning. I thought maybe this was my chance to have a family, but it wasn‚Äôt. Perhaps you can share a few lighter stories of how saying goodbye to a wrong person made space to the right one. Or another nice word of two to comfort anyone who's currently going through a heartbreak.",1,1760961864.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:

1. Add ""What's the hidden story behind..."" ‚Äî Suddenly everything has intrigue. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?"" 

Boom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.

2. Use ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about..."" ‚Äî Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. 

> ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?"" 

Pure comedy gold.

3. Ask ""What's the conspiracy theory version of..."" ‚Äî Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. 

> ""What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?"" 

Uncovers power dynamics you never saw.

4. Try ""How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?"" ‚Äî Evolution angle makes everything relevant. 

> ""How is small talk secretly a survival skill?"" 

Turns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.

5. Flip to ""What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?"" ‚Äî Pushes ideas to their breaking point. 

> ""What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?"" 

Reveals both possibilities and problems.

6. End with 

> ""What does this reveal about human nature?""  

The psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.

The trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.

Best part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on ""filing taxes"" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.

Secret sauce: Combine multiple angles. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?""

Even grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.

Sure, that jolt of caffeine wakes you up fairly quickly, but the problem is that coffee is also pretty acidic. Out of a¬†[pH scale](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/ph-scale-0)¬†of zero to 14‚Äîwith anything below a seven being considered highly acidic‚Äîcoffee lands somewhere around the¬†[4.8 to 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074501/)[^(1)](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/8d718092-3654-4f81-8a74-245a8ad936e7)¬†spot. This means if you already deal with gastrointestinal issues like¬†[acid reflux](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults), drinking a cup of joe on an empty stomach might make things a little worse.

Below, we‚Äôll learn whether drinking coffee on an empty stomach is truly bad for you long term. Plus, tips to make your morning cup a little easier on your gut‚Äîif you‚Äôre not quite sold on ditching this daily ritual.

# Is it bad to drink coffee on an empty stomach?

Spoiler alert: Downing a cup of coffee before breakfast isn‚Äôt necessarily bad for your stomach. A recent review about coffee‚Äôs gastrointestinal effects found that its acidity isn‚Äôt likely to¬†[mess with your stomach lining](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8778943/)[^(2)](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/7d29bcb5-6892-48fb-ba2b-a0cc512fa68a)¬†or increase your risk for gastrointestinal problems. (But it can still cause temporary irritation if you have acid reflux.)

[Supriya Rao, MD](https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/supriya-rao), a gastroenterologist with¬†[Tufts Medical Center](https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/)¬†in Boston, Massachusetts, agrees with this finding. However, she‚Äôs not personally a fan of drinking coffee without also eating a bit of food, which can help serve as a buffer to prevent an upset stomach or flare-up of symptoms from gut health conditions (like diarrhea with¬†[irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/), for example).

# Side effects of drinking coffee on an empty stomach

For many people, drinking coffee first thing in the morning¬†[helps them poop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/15914/)‚Ä¶*fast*. But for others, there might be some lesser-known (potentially negative) consequences to drinking the bean juice right when they wake up. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of those effects:

* **It may increase stomach acid.**¬†Because coffee is acidic, it‚Äôs possible that it can trigger or worsen symptoms of acid reflux or¬†[GERD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-gerd)¬†(where stomach acid flows up into your esophagus, causing burning and pain) if you already have it, Dr. Rao notes. Also, if you have an¬†[ulcer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354223)¬†(an open sore on the inner lining of your stomach), you might find drinking coffee on an empty stomach‚Äîor drinking it at all‚Äîmakes your stomach uncomfortable.
* **It could cause bloating or pain, especially if you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).**¬†Caffeine contains stimulant properties that can jumpstart your bowels and make you poop. But this effect can cause your¬†[stomach to cramp](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/5-foods-to-avoid-if-you-have-ibs), especially if you have a condition like IBS, which often leads to diarrhea, constipation, or a mix of both.¬†‚ÄúI generally advise patients who have bloating, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits from coffee to reduce their consumption overall,‚Äù Dr. Rao says.
* **It might make you more jittery.**¬†When you have coffee on an empty stomach, caffeine can¬†[enter your bloodstream faster](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/), potentially making you more sensitive to its stimulant effects. This can leave you¬†[feeling jittery](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-impact-caffeine), restless, and anxious, and even cause your¬†[heart to race](https://www.wellandgood.com/lifestyle/heart-races-at-night).
* **It may spike your blood sugar.**¬†For some people (especially those with¬†[diabetes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444)¬†or¬†[high blood sugar](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments)) coffee can slightly raise your blood sugar‚Äîeven if you drink it black. According to recent studies, this effect is about¬†[50 percent stronger](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/glucose-control-upon-waking-is-unaffected-by-hourly-sleep-fragmentation-during-the-night-but-is-impaired-by-morning-caffeinated-coffee/398A3EDA8C30EC89ADBB4C74C8E244B0)¬†when coffee is consumed on an empty stomach compared to when it‚Äôs consumed with breakfast.

# The best way to drink coffee to protect your gut

Long-term, it‚Äôs unlikely that coffee is going to do serious damage to your gut. So drinking it on an empty stomach (if it doesn‚Äôt bother you) is just fine. That said if you do notice an uptick in symptoms like reflux, pain, bloating, or jitteriness, and you still want your morning caffeine ritual, there are some things you can do to dampen the unpleasant effects.

Come to the bill payment we all started offering to pay cash then someone suggested using the new approach of Bill sharing that several payment apps use...

Beyond that it had me thinking a Pebble Scenario that's neither using onboard apps, beeper,  or timeline etc...

Think the scenario where 2 people are meeting at a location. Both Pebble users. Each said ping me when you get there and whoever is first will order the coffee...

So not wanting to use phone call or text message or fb messenger or any of the other external apps out there.

Scenario is tom gets there and presses something on his/her Pebble and the other sees some simple notify or hears a beep.. Maybe simple q like milk and sugar?

They are pre agreed 'buddies' in a sense of connectivity speak..

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1obh4iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twokinds/comments/1obh4iw/a_twokinds_au_order_part_iii_chapter_seven/,A Twokinds AU: Order Part III - Chapter Seven,"Natani hadn‚Äôt given up on wanting to be the first wolf in space. He wanted to give it a go again, especially after the peculiar event he experienced when he was nearly on top of the world. It had bothered him since. He figured they were memories, but they weren‚Äôt his, either. Yet, he felt a special connection to the ancient, violent conflict he witnessed. It might have had something to do with his dragon magic. It seemed Nora had left him with some baggage to carry in return for his transition. Still, Natani wished to see more and would have snuck off that night to try it again. However, when he heard Zen calling for him, he was forced to go to sleep first and visit the mindscape.¬†

There, he found the cabin. The garden Zen started had flourished and stretched for miles. It looked like his brother took full advantage of living in an imaginary world on borrowed time. Remembering that, Nat hurried toward the cabin. He grew worried that this was going to be the last time he ever saw him.

‚ÄúZen?‚Äù

He stopped when the door opened. Natani watched as someone walked out carrying a carpet. Although he couldn‚Äôt see their face, they were wearing a dress. Assuming it was Zen, Natani couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. Perhaps he lost a bet to Youngtani. Maybe his brother was into crossdressing, which Natani had no idea about. Zen was always open with him, sometimes too open, and it was never always their choice due to their past link. Still, this was something he kept well hidden from him. Not that it bothered Natani. Of course, he would make fun of him, but if Zen was into that sort of thing, he ought to be happy while he still had time. ¬†¬†

Once he was close enough, he remarked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit you look good in a dress. Not as good as Keith would, which is an excellent thought now that I mention it. Did you need me here to take your measurements?‚Äù

As it turned out, he wasn‚Äôt talking to his brother. As she started beating the rug, she revealed herself as Nayana, their mother. Natani was stunned. He thought he had forgotten what she looked like but knew it was her the moment he laid eyes on her. She had beautiful golden hair, eyes as blue as the sky, and a welcoming smile that greeted him. Natani could only shake his head, disbelieving she was there.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here,‚Äù Nayana said as she put the rug and beater down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad.‚Äù

Coming off the porch, she lifted her skirt and trotted toward him. Natani could only keep standing there as she threw herself in and embraced him. She felt real enough, too. Her embrace was all too comforting, but he was still unsure of how to react.¬†

Natani could only whimper, ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me,‚Äù she assured him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù

As unsure as he still was, Natani couldn‚Äôt help but return the hug. She could be an elaborate hallucination, but he wouldn‚Äôt be rude. It was all too tempting to embrace her as his mother.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you so much,‚Äù she cooed.¬†

He hesitated before responding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you too.‚Äù¬†¬†

Nayana took him by the cheeks and got a good look at him. ‚ÄúLook at you. You‚Äôre all grown up. To think you were just my little pup once.‚Äù¬†

Natani found it harder to suspect she was a hallucination the more he played along. He wasn‚Äôt playing all that much anymore, though. Reaching up, he touched her paws. He lowered his guard, something he used to find too difficult to do, especially in his old body. That reminded him, too.¬†

‚ÄúA lot has changed since then, Mom. There is a lot about me that you don‚Äôt--‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat can all wait,‚Äù she said as she led him to the porch. ‚ÄúYou just got here, honey.‚Äù

It felt too good to be true. Natani had no idea what had brought on his mother's image so abruptly. Yet, everyday magic couldn‚Äôt have done this. He was aware that there were great powers in the world that could create illusions if the practitioner was skilled enough, or if it was dragon magic. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he had conjured her involuntarily, but it didn‚Äôt matter now since Nayana was there anyway. As they walked up the stairs, Natani was in for an even bigger surprise.¬†

Coming outside was his father, Koan.

‚ÄúDad?!‚Äù

Koan, who was as handsome and rugged with his short brown hair and eyes, which Natani and Zen inherited, smiled warmly. Zen followed him out, initially getting a growl out of Natani. He suspected it was a trick by his brother all along. However, he remembered that Zen had as distant a memory of their parents as he did. Plus, the magic his brother knew and what little of it he used wouldn‚Äôt have been enough to create something as complicated as this. Natani was struck by the way Zen looked at him then. He didn‚Äôt seem to be playing a joke on him, after all. Zen was genuinely happy, which Natani hadn‚Äôt seen often since they were orphans. His brother might have always projected a high spirit with a mischievous streak, but he always knew it was an act. A glimmer in Zen‚Äôs eyes showed he was as much a pup again as Natani was.¬†

That was enough.¬†

Natani pulled away from their mother and asked, ‚ÄúWhat is happening here?‚Äù

Zen teased, ‚ÄúWhat does it look like, dummy? Mom and Dad are here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI know they‚Äôre here,‚Äù he rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúWHAT are they doing here?‚Äù

Koan shrugged, ‚ÄúYour brother wanted to tell you right away, but I wanted to see the look on your face. You didn‚Äôt disappoint.‚Äù

Like father, like son.¬†

Nayana seemed hurt when she added, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want us here, Nani?‚Äù

He closed his eyes, having not heard that nickname for so long. He thought he had forgotten it. No doubt they were real. He needed to keep it together.¬†

‚ÄúOf course, Mom. This place is just‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

When he looked at their parents, he grew elated. The more he took their presence in, the happier he was.¬†

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù he said, pulling his mother in for another embrace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you! Both of you! You‚Äôre both here!‚Äù¬†

Zen leaned against the railing and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save you the trouble. You have nothing to do with them being here, Nani--‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNatani,‚Äù he snarled back. ‚ÄúOnly Mom gets to call me that.‚Äù¬†

Zen laughed to himself while their father stepped off the approach. Picking up some straw, he stuck it into his mouth and chewed on the end.¬†

‚ÄúThere is a good explanation for all of this,‚Äù Koan said.

Natani responded, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù¬†¬†

His family shared a look, but it wasn‚Äôt a happy one. Natani took note of their abrupt change of mood, but Koan was quick to change the subject upon reaching him. He gave Natani a pat on the shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúThat can wait. What matters is that you‚Äôre here now. We have a lot to catch up on.‚Äù¬†

Of course, there was all that. Natani suspected they were keeping something from him, but having accepted that they were reunited, whatever the explanation may be, he agreed to leave it for now if that meant they could be a family again. Besides, he didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have anywhere else to go for a while since they were all in his head. As for what they‚Äôd catch up on, first, Natani decided to address the elephant in the mindscape.

‚ÄúMom, Dad. I‚Äôm not who you remember me as.‚Äù¬†

They grew confused and looked at each other.¬†

Koan asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù¬†

Nayana replied, ‚ÄúAre you not our son?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, I am your son, but‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Natani stopped when he realized they knew. Nayana rubbed Natani‚Äôs arm reassuringly. Eyeing Zen, his brother sipped from a mug and smiled. Natani didn‚Äôt see their acceptance coming. All his life, he thought they‚Äôd reject him if they had lived, and he came out to them. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúAre you sure? I mean, I‚Äôm not your daughter--‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre our child,‚Äù Nayana told him. ‚ÄúWe love you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit it took some getting used to at first,‚Äù Koan shrugged. ‚ÄúNo parent expects their kid to think they‚Äôre a girl one day, a boy the next.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI told you that‚Äôs not how it was with Nat, Dad.‚Äù¬†

They all looked at Zen. With all eyes on him, he grew embarrassed and slurped from his coffee.¬†

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said from inside his mug. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my place to tell them, Nat, I know. I was just excited when they suddenly showed up, and I just opened my big mouth. You should tell them everything else.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Natani sighed, scratching his head. ‚ÄúSo, uh, where do I even begin?‚Äù

He eyed his father, who fidgeted where he stood. Koan might have been smiling, but it felt forced. All was not well regarding his gender identity in the family. Knowing it was a big moment for all of them, he found his courage.¬†

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù he said. ¬†¬†

Moments later, Natani was sharing the porch swing with their mother while Zen and their father looked on. He told them everything he remembered after he and Zen were left alone, from their time in the guild, meeting Keith, dying, and coming back to life with dragon magic. He didn‚Äôt talk much about his new body or the fact that he was trans. It turned out that was the hardest thing to discuss with his parents. He never thought he‚Äôd get to talk about it with them. Even though they had already accepted him, he still struggled to discuss it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a guy,‚Äù he finally explained. ‚ÄúI know that must be weird to hear since I was born with a female body, as you are aware. I just never thought I belonged in that body. It was like it wasn‚Äôt mine. I felt trapped in it. I always felt that way, even as a little pup.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat must have been horrible to feel,‚Äù Nayana sighed. ‚ÄúIf I had known‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could you have known, Mom? It wasn‚Äôt like I could casually explain that I was your son in the wrong body when I couldn‚Äôt even form words yet. Once I could, I‚Äôm sure that would have gotten me into a lot of trouble, and I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen to any of you, either. There wasn‚Äôt much I could have said anyway, nor could you, Mom. Considering how females were treated amongst our kind‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Everyone grew ashamed.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Natani added. ‚ÄúFemales had it bad enough, but imagine if I had been outed? They would have cast me out as a freak.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI would have allowed it,‚Äù Koan admitted sadly.

Everyone looked at him in surprise, but Natani immediately understood. Zen, however, wasn‚Äôt so understanding.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about, Dad? You accept him now, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI understand NOW. It‚Äôs just that back then, while we were alive, I wouldn‚Äôt have been so understanding. I would have been the one who chased you from the pack, Natani.‚Äù¬†

Zen growled, ‚ÄúDad, what the fu‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúZen,‚Äù Natani interrupted. ‚ÄúLet him talk.‚Äù ¬†¬†

It wasn‚Äôt easy for their father. As Natani watched him struggle to explain, he felt sorry for him, knowing he must have carried this guilt, even in death.¬†

‚ÄúI always knew there was something different about you,‚Äù Koan told him. ‚ÄúI chose not to acknowledge it when I could have helped you. I was as much a problem as the rest of our tribe and their damned beliefs were. In every family, there was always an omega, and the tribe elders gave the alpha of the family a choice: get rid of the omega, or the entire family would be cast out.‚Äù

They all knew this to be the policy of many Forest Wolf tribes. Natani didn‚Äôt remember much of their tribe, but his travels with Zen and the guild reminded him of it. In fact, some of the wolves Clovis recruited were omegas.¬†

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have let our whole family be ostracized,‚Äù Koan revealed tearfully. ‚ÄúI remember what I would have done in life, Natani. I would have chosen the coward‚Äôs way out. The fact that I never got the chance doesn‚Äôt make it any less wrong. What kind of father am I?‚Äù¬†

Seeing their father cry upset Natani. Getting up, he approached Koan.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúI failed you,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúCan you ever forgive me--‚Äù

Natani punched him in the face. It wasn‚Äôt hard enough to hurt him, but it snapped him out of it. Taken by surprise, Koan felt his cheek.¬†

‚ÄúI learned a thing or two from someone I care about,‚Äù Natani said, holding his fist up. ‚ÄúOur kind aren‚Äôt great at showing affection, so I thought I‚Äôd show it another way.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy punching me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird, I know,‚Äù Natani shrugged. ‚ÄúAnyway, I want you to know everything is forgiven and forgotten.‚Äù¬†

Although Koan managed a smile, the four fell into awkward silence after what Natani pulled. He still couldn‚Äôt do emotional moments well and had to break the tension somehow. Still, he didn‚Äôt hold it against their father. Zen wasn‚Äôt so quick to forgive him, being the protective older brother. Natani just couldn‚Äôt hold grudges. He left enough drama behind in his first life, anyway. After getting a second chance, he decided things would be different now.

‚ÄúI still want to make it up to you,‚Äù Koan said, rubbing his cheek uncomfortably. Maybe Natani did hit him too hard. ‚ÄúIs there anything you want to know about being a male?‚Äù

Natani blushed, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm starting to get the hang of that, Dad. Zen has told me enough anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he tell you to tuck in before zipping your pants?‚Äù

Natani flinched. Noting how pained Koan sounded, he eyed Zen, who cringed as his paw moved to his pants. It was as if the three shared each other‚Äôs pain. Looking at Nayana, Natani found her unamused.

‚ÄúBoys,‚Äù Nayana said flatly, rolling her eyes.¬†",4,1760961600.0,Twokinds,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôve more-so recently distanced myself from her husband as on his downtime he drinks, vapes and smokes pot too much. His wife has been unhappy for quite sometime (they are together for 22 years) and has been very depressed constantly telling my wife and myself of her unhappiness.. her husband is very hard to approach in matters because of his personality. There is zero communication between them. He doesn‚Äôt speak to her and ignores her sometimes for weeks.. she feels emotionally drained and hurt but masks it often. When we are all together (other friends also) she smiles and laughs but other times she‚Äôs hurting extensively and speaks of leaving him but feels trapped.. she reaches out to me often because I have a good listening personality. My wife is very comfortable with her and I talking, texting and occasionally spending time with each other for coffee, porch sitting conversations and a walk‚Ä¶ Her husband couldn‚Äôt care less for he‚Äôs always working and when he‚Äôs home doesn‚Äôt speak nor show any interest in her. He heads to his man cave garage to play with his dogs, drink and have the other neighborhood fellas over to party‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm there occasionally also having a beer watching the games and having guy talk. I‚Äôve tried on instances mentioning to him that his wife talks to my wife and she seems unhappy‚Ä¶ He blows it off to the routine alpha male comment: ‚Äúwomen are never happy and if she‚Äôs so unhappy she can get the eff out‚Äù‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a good friend to me and my wife and to other neighbors within the community, as is his wife.
So to get to the point, she reaches out to me more often recently and I find myself attracted to her (maybe sympathetic).. she tells me the sexual preparation she does for her husband only to be turned down (they have been sleeping in separate rooms for months).
Again, my wife knows these things for us 3 discuss them together and also separate.. my wife tells me maybe I should give her a night of romantic passion for she hasn‚Äôt had it in years (though she‚Äôs joking).. I get the gut feeling my neighbor wants to engage sexually for she misses sex but the whole dynamic is weird and strange. Plus, if it were to happen what would it be like after the dust settles?‚Ä¶ Also, recently I‚Äôve been thinking about her to the point I jerk off to her‚Ä¶  she‚Äôs no prude for within all four of our closeness we‚Äôve discussed our past stories and situations.. my neighbor hasn‚Äôt been an angel in her past neither has her husband‚Ä¶  anyway‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm laying in bed and just wanted to vent‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm planning a 15-day self-supported cycling trip in Meghalaya and I need a good quality touring/road bike for the duration.

**Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:**

* Someone in Delhi or Chandigarh who might be willing to lend (or rent) me a bike for about 15 days.
* Alternatively, any trustworthy rental service in Delhi/Chandigarh that offers touring/road bikes (not just casual city cycle) for \~2 weeks.
* I‚Äôm happy to provide a security deposit, cover any maintenance/repairs, and take full responsibility.
* Would prefer a bike with gears, good brakes (disc or rim), reasonably sized tyres (35-50 mm) if possible for rough roads.
* I‚Äôll pick up/drop off in Delhi/Chandigarh.

**Why I‚Äôm doing this:**  
I‚Äôve always wanted to explore the Northeast on a bicycle ... the terrain, the climbs, the raw beauty .... it‚Äôs been on my bucket list for a long time. Since I had to sell my bike a few months ago, buying a new one just for this trip doesn‚Äôt make sense right now. So I‚Äôm hoping someone from the Delhi or Chandigarh cycling community could help me out. I‚Äôll take great care of the bike and make sure it‚Äôs returned in perfect condition ..... maybe even share a coffee or beer when I‚Äôm back as a thank you üôÇ",3,1760961162.0,india_cycling,1,1.0,False

1obguds,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1obguds/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_parts_12/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk - [Parts 1&2],"Part I

If you're reading this, it's because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" ‚Äî who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

They blinked at me.


Part II

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

Bane?

1obgtur,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectDresscode/comments/1obgtur/are_you_searching_for_the_goal_of_human_life_dont/,are you searching for the goal of human life ? dont because here is that purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free ¬£50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free ¬£50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my ¬£50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you‚Äôre happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your ¬£50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your ‚Äúactual‚Äù energy usage using an old bill instead of using the ‚Äúlow, medium, high‚Äù options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the ¬£50 switch reward was a total bonus. The ¬£50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I‚Äôve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

TW: mention of self-harm

Backstory before how we met: I was in a long relationship with someone with extreme mental health issues that broke my own mental health. How I was treated was abusive for years through emotional coercion, such as threatening self harm, destroying my self-worth and plenty of more extreme things I am not comfortable sharing, 

We met at work, joining together as part of an early careers cohort. I was still with my ex-girlfriend then. We became good friends quickly. To be honest, I fell in love with her. Didn‚Äôt even quite realise it at the time, but I did. My relationship ended about 6 months into this friendship, it was strung out as a family member of mine passed away in unfortunate circumstances and it was a lot going on. Once this settled, I finally got the courage to break up with my ex girlfriend. 

Unfortunately, and it‚Äôs something I deeply regret, my mental health was horrendous. I was deeply emotionally unstable. It was like I lost grip on reality. It was like my brain snapped. I think until my breakup I had been in survival mode, and then it all came crashing down. 

After I broke up with my ex, me and the other girl began talking daily at length. I can speak to a few moments and things that made me think feelings were reciprocated, but she ended up pulling away. In particular due to rumours from other people. I remember being told that she was suspicious as I had only just left my ex (in her words an unfortunate relationship), that there were things she‚Äôd rather have heard from me first (I assume my feelings for her) as well as general disdain at the rumours. She‚Äôs also never been in a relationship or anything before - so I get why it would have truly sucked for her. I won‚Äôt assume she had any feelings beyond possible curiosity. 

In my emotionally unstable, heartbroken state, I got extremely drunk and apparently said some horrible things to her (which from what I understand were attempts at humour that landed EXTREMELY badly). I‚Äôm still not sure to what exactly, but from what I‚Äôve told nothing corresponds to what I actually think. 

I‚Äôm also going to add I was never a needy friend - our friendship was jokey, a little bit ‚Äúdeep‚Äù, but centred on humour and just having a good time. That‚Äôs usually who I am, an unserious, jokey, outgoing person who is also a dork. Just to make clear that I am not someone who made a personality out of outsourcing emotional labour. 

Fast forward over a year, and I‚Äôve put magnitudes of effort into fixing my mental health, which has by and large been really successful, and also getting over her despite seeing her around. I‚Äôve seen her a few times the last few months, including last week. She told a mutual friend that it was really good to see me, and she‚Äôs also asked to meet for a coffee this week, which is tomorrow. She started a conversation over text a bit, where I didn‚Äôt really reciprocate at first, but she didn‚Äôt reply in a couple days once the conversation opened (which is ok). I‚Äôll see how tomorrow goes. The only thing is last week in particular reawoke the feelings - and they aren‚Äôt nice ones. Loving someone who doesn‚Äôt love you back sucks. 

The issue is that you can‚Äôt undo falling in love with someone. I don‚Äôt wish for her to suddenly fall for me, I just want her to be happy. But I don‚Äôt want to be in emotional anguish either. I ultimately really wish I could just see her as a friend, but I can‚Äôt. 

Should I tell her that while I appreciate her reaching out/the olive branch, my feelings for her are/were too much and that I need distance? Still happy to see her occasionally in group settings, but speaking one on one and texting derail me emotionally. In particular I want to move on and find someone who actually likes me back, which I deserve, which I can‚Äôt do if in even semi-regular contact. Should I do that? Or should I just have the coffee tomorrow, then just not message her/avoid her and do it quietly? I‚Äôm at a loss as to a way forward that helps me move on but also doesn‚Äôt unnecessarily put her in an uncomfortable position. 

I won‚Äôt be her friend while silently wishing for more. It‚Äôs not fair on her and it‚Äôs not fair on me. And I don‚Äôt know how to reach that stage. ",1,1760960489.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

### Background
This was my third marathon and my third time training with Pfitz 18/55. I ran Abingdon last year and did not intend to repeat it, but found myself qualified to run as an England Masters Representative which I could not resist! This is for older runners 35+ and we run versus Wales to compete in 5-year age categories. I date the start of my running from my first Parkrun in July 2022 so it was exciting to wear an England vest just three and a bit years later.

### Training
I followed the schedule in Advanced Marathoning by Pfitzinger and Douglas fairly closely though not perfectly; sometimes life got in the way, and sometimes I could not quite manage the pace, especially on the LT (Lactate Threshold) and VO‚ÇÇ max sessions. The other factor that messed things up was my running club sessions once a week which I treated as extra, the consequence being that I ended up running a higher mileage than the plan expects. I ran the 18 miles with 14 at MP well though which was  encouraging. My peak week was 71 miles, and the last week before taper 65 miles. I took the view that if my body could handle it, more mileage was probably a good thing.

### Pre-race
Stayed in the official marathon hotel which has the advantage of a shuttle bus to the start and finish. Arrived early on Saturday so we could do the local parkrun; I managed not to go all-out but still probably ran harder than recommended, completing the 5K in about 2 minutes more than it usually takes me. I don‚Äôt think it did me any harm. 

My carb-load strategy is not very scientific but I try to eat more than usual on the two or three days before the race. So I had two breakfasts with extra apple and cinnamon roll, then a decent lunch back at the hotel. After that I ate very little, soup and bread for supper, then an early breakfast roll laden with jam 3 to 4 hours before the race (5:30am in this case). The idea is to be somewhat carb-loaded but without running into GI issues during the race, and so far it has worked OK.

### Shoe angst

I ran Manchester in April with nearly new Saucony Endorphin Pro 4; I know they are not the fastest super shoe, but they are fairly quick, and I find them comfortable. Since then I have put at least 250 miles on them, so I bought a second pair in the summer sales. My assumption was that they would be more or less the same, but I found the new pair had firmer foam in the soles and were not as comfortable, giving me anxiety about whether I could run 26.2 miles in them without pain. I took both pairs with me to Abingdon and had a quick run up and down the hotel car park in one, then the other. Decided to wear the old ones just in case. I still don‚Äôt know whether the difference is because of wear, or manufacturing variation, but had zero issues with the shoes during the race so feel I made the right choice.


### Race
After a bit of hanging around, and an official photo of the England and Wales Masters teams, we were assembled in the start area with vague instructions to go near the front if fast, then it was go time. You run most of the way round a track, then out onto roads. Some congestion at the start but without only just over 1,000 runners, not too bad. The course is flat, mostly on roads but with some sections of firm trail. A big plus with this race is the exceptionally friendly marshals; there are also some pretty sections through the old town of Abingdon and alongside the river Thames. The downside is that some of the course goes round a science park, not very inspiring, and the roads are quiet but not closed so sometimes you have to run on pavements (sidewalks) which I dislike. Weather was cool and damp, quite good for running though with occasional rain and some light wind.

My marathon philosophy is to go out at your target pace and just stay there. I was a bit fuzzy about my goal though. I did 3:27:46 in Manchester, and of course wanted to beat it, but being unsure about whether my fitness had improved at all I also had in mind to run at about the same pace. In practice I found it hard to be precise as the pace shown on my Garmin at any one time isn‚Äôt all that accurate. So if the pace went below 8:00/mile I sped up, and if it went above 7:40/mile I slowed down. 

The miles ticked by and I wasn‚Äôt sure that I could hold the pace but somehow I did. In classic marathon style, the first half was medium effort and I passed the 13 mile post in about 1:43 which was nicely on target. I felt good at this point and in fact mile 13 was my fastest at 7:38 pace, oops! One reason what that I was chatting to another runner and somehow we both ended up going too fast. 

I put in some extra effort on the next 7 miles being keen to get to mile 20 when the race, some say, really begins. Every time my watch beeped to indicate a mile completed I checked it and was glad to see numbers beginning with 7.

Mile 20 arrived and felt fatigued but pounded on. I was trying to calculate my finish time based on current pace and failing, though I knew that keeping under 8:00 should ensure a sub-3:30 finish. It was only at mile 25 that I struggled to keep the pace but looking at the splits I still managed it in 7:57. Then for mile 26 I told myself it was nearly over and I should just keep going. It was tough but I would say a little less so than Manchester where I was more dehydrated because of an unexpectedly warm day.

The course finishes with another loop round the running track and I managed a little speed increase and overtook someone almost on the line.

Pleased with my time even though it is not quite good enough for Berlin (3:25) - which is a bit annoying as in hindsight I feel I could have got that if I'd focused on it, rather than having rather a vague goal. I was nowhere near the podium but within the England Masters group I was 5th out of 10 VM65 runners, the quickest being 3:04:16 and the slowest 3:42:26. Considering that I had a bout of impostor syndrome going into this that is not too bad!

### Nutrition
Nutrition during the race? I am not very good at this. I took 9 SIS gels with me, two of them the stronger beta variety. But I only consumed 5 of them, one just before the start, and the others at approximately 5 mile intervals, skipped the one at 25 miles as I thought it would make no difference at that stage in the race. In addition I didn‚Äôt stop at all the water stations but only when I felt thirsty, I think about 4 times.

I do want to get better at this and consume something closer to the recommended amount of carbs during the race. That said, I‚Äôm not sure I would have been much faster as I kept close to target pace throughout.

### Post race

A bit stiff but walking OK. Obligatory pic with medal for Strava, grabbed my things, had a shower (bonus of a smaller marathon!), downed a veggie burger and coffee then off home.

I went through a tough school and was surrounded exclusively by men. There is exactly one woman in a similar position to me, but she is even tougher and more abrasive than I am. 

From the very beginning, discrimination against women in IT was a big issue for me. I remember serving lots of coffee and loading paper into printers instead of learning how to set up a print server or how Exchange works. Every single company I worked for treated me unfairly compared to my male colleagues. Acquiring knowledge and skills on my own took an inhuman amount of energy, and even today, as a senior employee with a lot of experience and far removed from printer problems, I still have to prove myself over and over again. I have to give at least 120% just to get close to one of my male colleagues. 

My abilities and skills were ignored and, on the contrary, discredited. Even when I was 100% right, as a woman I was treated differently than when ‚Äúthe man‚Äù said it. 

I had to learn to be tougher than a man, more unyielding, more drastic in my choice of words, more consistent in my boundaries, just to be halfway on par.

Shipments from the world's largest rare earth magnet supplier stood at 5,774 metric tons in September, down from a seven-month high of 6,146 tons in August, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Monday.

ersus the same month a year earlier, exports rose 17.5%.

The monthly decline came as Chinese rare earth magnet firms have faced tighter scrutiny on export license applications since September.

The government announced on the first working day after a week-long National Day holiday, on October 9, to expand rare earth export controls ahead of trade talks between President Xi Jinping and U.S. counterpart Donald Trump.

The U.S. has imposed a series of restrictions on U.S. exports to China as well as tariffs on Chinese imports.

By country, Germany, South Korea, Vietnam, the United States and Mexico were the top five export destinations for Chinese rare earth magnets by volume last month.

China announced export controls for several rare earth elements and magnets in early April. Rare earth magnet exports tumbled in April and May, causing supply shortages that forced global automakers to curtail production.

Rare earth magnet exports recovered over June to August after a series of trade deals reached with the European Union and the United States.

In the first three quarters of 2025, rare earth magnet exports totalled 39,817 tons, a fall of 7.5% from the corresponding period in 2024.

# Oct. 20th, 2025~Australia Courts US Backing To Break China's Grip On Critical Minerals

[Australia Courts US Backing To Break China's Grip On Critical Minerals - Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF (ARCA:SILJ), VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF (ARCA:REMX) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/10/48298580/australia-courts-us-backing-to-break-chinas-grip-on-critical-minerals)

Australia is pitching itself as a solution to the U.S. critical metal problems. The West has struggled to break China‚Äôs grip on the 50-odd ‚Äúcritical minerals‚Äù that are vital for electronics, renewables, defense systems, and more. However, Monday‚Äôs meeting between Australian Prime Minister¬†**Anthony Albanese**¬†and President¬†**Donald Trump**¬†might bring the two nations closer to bridging this¬†[commodities gap](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities).

Treasury Secretary¬†**Scott Bessent**¬†[warned](https://www.ft.com/content/15a957a7-104e-431a-807e-441e5c2c753f?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†that China‚Äôs export restrictions signal ‚ÄúChina versus the world,‚Äù according to the Financial Times. Bessent¬†[told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/australia-pitches-to-be-trump-s-fix-for-china-rare-earths-curbs?srnd=phx-politics)¬†Bloomberg that U.S. officials are in discussions with European allies, Australia, Canada, India, and other Asian democracies to coordinate a response.

From Australia‚Äôs side the pitch is clear. The country offers massive deposits of lithium, rare earths and other strategic elements, coupled with a globally competitive mining sector and mining-engineering expertise.

‚ÄúAustralia equals the periodic table. Having it is one thing ‚Äî knowing how to mine it ‚Ä¶ is another ‚Äî and we have the world‚Äôs biggest and best miners,‚Äù Australia‚Äôs Ambassador to the U.S.,¬†**Kevin Rudd**, said per Bloomberg.

Rudd noted that the U.S. currently has a deficiency in many of the 50 designated critical minerals. With proper investment and offtake agreements, Australia ‚Äúcan meet 30 to 40 of those without much additional effort, most particularly in terms of processed rare earths.‚Äù

According¬†[to](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/18/albanese-trump-white-house-visit-critical-mineral-deal-australia?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†The Guardian, Australia is offering the U.S. access to a proposed 1.2 billion Australian dollars ($780 million) critical minerals reserve as a signaling mechanism of trusted supply. Terms of such a deal are still uncertain, but even equity stakes are not out of the question. The U.S. government is increasingly willing to take equity stakes in strategic supply-chain companies. State-capitalism has re-entered mining sector, and Washington is not just a buyer ‚Äî it may become a co-owner and strategic partner.

Yet, Australia has its conditions. It needs U.S. investment, technology transfer, downstream refining capacity, offtake guarantees and security assurances‚Äîespecially under the broader security umbrella of the AUKUS pact. Australia also wants to ensure that its resource diplomacy does not force it into a direct confrontation with China, its largest trading partner.

These risks are exactly what former Prime Minister¬†**Paul Keating**¬†[warned](https://australianfoodtimeline.com.au/paul-keating/)¬†nearly four decades ago. The danger of Australia relying on digging rocks and letting advanced manufacturing slip away.

‚ÄúWe took the view in the 1970s ‚Äì it‚Äôs the old cargo-cult mentality, ‚Äòwe‚Äôll just dig up another mound of rock and someone will buy it from us. If Australia is so undisciplined that it doesn‚Äôt deal with these fundamental problems ‚Ä¶ Then you are gone. You are a banana republic,‚Äù he said.

# ‚úÖ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple¬†**Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and¬†**future recycling**
* Alignment with the¬†**MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**,¬†**DoD offtakes**,¬†**EXIM funding**, and the¬†new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì The¬†*quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# ‚öîÔ∏è NIOCORP ‚Äî ‚ÄúBattle Stations....THE WEEK OF IGNITION!‚Äù

**Monday opens with Niocorp trading around $8.80 on volume** (\~280k early), but under the surface, **the tape is wound tight. After last week‚Äôs 100-million-share rotation‚Äînearly the full float‚Äîthe stock is coiled between $8.00 and $9.00, setting up what looks like a short-compression chamber ahead of back-to-back catalysts.** The $9.34 offering reset the base; the weak hands are gone; **the float is in institutional control. With Maxim‚Äôs $15 target already live and chatter from the Schwab event hinting that a defense prime partnership is imminent, this week marks the transition from setup to execution.**

**üî• Catalysts Now in Motion**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Drill Hole #2 (and possibly #3) Results ‚Äì Imminent:** The first 42 m intercept at 1.33 % Nb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ and \~3,000 ppm TREO was the opening salvo, not the climax. Assays are in queue, and Niocorp‚Äôs own statements point to multiple cores being processed. Any repeat or upgrade of those numbers could instantly re-rate the deposit model and trap shorts above $9.50.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Offtake Agreements ‚Äì Imminent:** EXIM‚Äôs own conditions require signed offtakes before final FID. Market chatter suggests multiple parties‚Äîcovering Scandium, Niobium, and Titanium‚Äîare at term-sheet stage. Leaving room for announcements before or during the investor roadshow window.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **$150 M Financing Closed ‚Üí $300 M Total Capital Secured:** This sequence of 2025 raises ($20M ‚Üí $45M ‚Üí $50M ‚Üí $60M ‚Üí $150M) positions Niocorp within striking distance of EXIM‚Äôs equity threshold for matched debt financing. (Now stands at 75%) \~ The company is now fully qualified for EXIM and DFC co-investment readiness.

**üèõ Event Sequence ‚Äì ‚ÄúThree Guns Broadside‚Äù**  
üîπ **Maxim Growth Summit ‚Äì Oct 22‚Äì23 (NYC)**  
üîπ **RedChip Emerging Growth Conference ‚Äì Oct 27 (Virtual)**  
üîπ **ThinkEquity Conference ‚Äì Oct 30 (NYC / Live Stream)**  
You don‚Äôt book **three national stages** unless you‚Äôre sitting on **strong data and deep confidence.** Management isn‚Äôt just showing up ‚Äî they‚Äôre **signaling a coordinated launch sequence.** Between Munich, Denver, and D.C., the tone has shifted from exploration to **execution**, and every cue points to a company aligning capital, policy, and technology for maximum impact.

‚öôÔ∏è **November Scandium-Aluminum (Sc-Al) Reveal ‚Äî ‚ÄúMade in America. Forged for Defense.‚Äù**  
A confirmed partnership announcement with a **U.S. Defense Prime** is widely expected. This marks the **first domestic Sc-Al prototype in a century**, likely integrated into **GENVI Aerospace** or related defense frameworks. This quietly positions Niocorp at the front of the **critical materials-to-defense supply chain**, exactly where EXIM and DoD want U.S. production anchored.

üìä **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) + EXIM Final Investment Decision (FID):**  
The upgraded DFS will unveil a **refined mine plan, expanded ore data, and efficiency breakthroughs** (notably via **RailVeyor electrified transport**). This is the linchpin for EXIM‚Äôs credit committee ‚Äî turning their current ‚Äúconditional support‚Äù into a **full green light for construction financing**. With **$800M EXIM**, **UKREF participation**, and **German Loan Guarantees** still in the mix, Niocorp‚Äôs funding base is shaping into a **multinational strategic financing grid**, de-risking the build-out and potentially accelerating ground operations toward Mark Smith‚Äôs ‚Äú**two-year to above ground facility completion**‚Äù goal.

üßæ **Offtake Agreements & Market Catalysts:**  
Offtakes are now the final box to check for EXIM‚Äôs FID. Negotiations are believed to be active across **Scandium, Niobium, Titanium & REE verticals** ‚Äî with buyers from **defense primes to EV and aerospace OEMs**. Layer on the **$150M capital raise**, **record early trading momentum ($8.80 premarket)**, and **Maxim‚Äôs $15 target (potentially conservative)** ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear: Niocorp‚Äôs ignition window (Oct 21‚ÄìNov 8) is now open. Every signal ‚Äî from policy alignment to financial mobilization ‚Äî says the countdown has begun.

In my case, it‚Äôs GAD but I have some specific triggers that make every day life a little ‚Äúextra‚Äù (to say the least). 

Since starting Buspar (I‚Äôm officially heading into week three), I‚Äôve noticed that I feel a far more physical anxiety vs. mental. Meaning, I‚Äôll get all the intense physical sensations but my brain isn‚Äôt jumping in and worsening it with its incessant looping. I started noticing that more intentionally and when it happens / what I‚Äôm doing at the time, etc. 

The first place I noticed major heightened anxiety was coffee. Then I realized I‚Äôm drinking SO much coffee!! Buspar makes you more sensitive to it according to what I researched, but overall, I was drinking too much anyway (I‚Äôm a very small lady and treat my body like a human punching bag sometimes). This caused me to look closer at other things I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm also in somatic therapy which I think helps a lot be able to even understand the difference between brain/body but anywho, all this to say. This has been revelatory that I think a lot of my anxiety is a physical response to people, places, things, lack of boundaries, wrong choice of foods, etc.

Some things I‚Äôm working on (and perhaps you can relate to?)
- Absorbing others emotions 
- Taking on too much work / responsibility
- Saying yes when it‚Äôs really a hell no / avoiding conflict and people pleasing 
- Being in environments/relationships/situations that aren‚Äôt reciprocal 
- Consuming substances that dysregulate you (ie caffeine and certain foods) 
- Not having clear enough boundaries
- Processing some past physical and emotional traumas in therapy 

I now have a whole new view of this Buspar journey and how it can help me set a baseline with these foundational pieces in technicolor clarity. 

Not sure if this is at all helpful (please don‚Äôt come for me if it‚Äôs not!!), but wondered if anyone else had physical manifestations of anxiety and Buspar helped the mental chatter go down? 

If so, perhaps it‚Äôs a messenger to look closer at some of the ways the body really does ‚Äúkeep the score‚Äù in our lives and can be used to guide us and inform us.",1,1760959908.0,BusparOnline,0,1.0,False

1obghkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1obghkx/were_all_addicted_and_pretending_were_not/,We're all addicted and pretending we're not,"Look around next time you're in public. The grocery store, the coffee shop, the bus. Everyone's staring at their phones. Couples sitting across from each other scrolling. Parents ignoring their kids to check notifications. People walking into things because they can't look up for ten seconds.

We've normalized something that's completely insane. We're willingly giving away hours of our lives every single day to apps designed to keep us hooked, and we all just act like it's fine.

I didn't think I had a problem. I'd tell myself I was just staying connected, staying informed, being productive. But then I actually looked at my screen time. Seven hours a day. On my phone. That's a full-time job worth of scrolling, and I had nothing to show for it.

The scary part is how automatic it became. Wake up, grab phone. Waiting for coffee, pull out phone. Red light, check phone. Bathroom, bring phone. Before bed, scroll until I couldn't keep my eyes open. I wasn't making conscious decisions anymore. My hand just moved to my pocket like a reflex.

And I'm not special. Everyone I know is doing the same thing. We've all become these half-present zombies, physically in one place but mentally somewhere else. Having dinner with friends but checking Instagram between bites. Watching a movie but also scrolling Twitter. We can't just exist in one moment anymore.

The breaking point for me was watching a kid on the subway. Maybe seven years old. Completely glued to a tablet while his dad was glued to his phone. Neither of them said a word to each other for twenty minutes. And I realized that's where we're headed. A generation of people who don't know how to be bored, who can't sit with their own thoughts, who need constant digital stimulation just to feel normal.

I tried to quit cold turkey once. Lasted two days before the anxiety got so bad I caved. That's when I realized this isn't just a habit. It's an addiction. And we're all feeding it every single day.

So I tried something different. I started tracking when I reached for my phone and why. Most of the time there was no reason. I was just uncomfortable, bored, avoiding something, or filling a three-second gap. Once I saw the pattern, it became harder to ignore.

I deleted social media from my phone. Not my accounts, just the apps. If I wanted to check something I had to do it on my computer. That friction alone cut my usage in half. I stopped bringing my phone to the bathroom. Left it in another room when I ate meals. Put it on airplane mode after 9 PM.

It's been four months now. My screen time is down to two hours a day and most of that is actually useful stuff. Navigation, music, texts. Not mindless consumption.

I can now sit through an entire conversation without my hand twitching toward my pocket. I can watch a sunset without needing to photograph it. I can wait in line without immediately looking for distraction. I remember what I read because I'm actually paying attention.

The weirdest part is seeing everyone else still trapped in it. The constant checking. The panic when they can't find their phone. The way they're only half-present in every interaction. And nobody talks about it like the crisis it actually is.

We're watching an entire society develop a dependency on devices that literally profit from keeping us hooked, and we've just accepted it as normal. Kids are growing up thinking this is how humans are supposed to live. Always connected, always distracted, never fully here.

I'm not saying technology is evil or we should all go live in the woods. But we need to admit what's happening. We're trading real experiences for digital simulacra. We're trading presence for perpetual distraction. And most of us don't even realize how much we've lost.

If you can't go two hours without checking your phone, you're not connected. You're dependent. And maybe it's time to ask if we're the ones in control or its our phones that is in control.",11,1760959597.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

Got my DF54 delivered from Fix. Machine looks beautiful and perfectly matches with my Dedica duo white.

18g of coffee at 13 grind dial on DF54.
Extracted 36g of espresso in like 42 ish seconds. I use Bottomless portafilter and non pressurized basket. Extraction looked perfect without any chanelling or spritz. Glass had half espresso and half crema. Unfortunately didn't click the pic of espresso. Have attached pic of cappuccino. (Ignore my terrible latte art)

My question is most people who use DF54 say they set the dial somewhere between 7-10 for espresso. Even those using the Dedica. But my extraction was already way too slow at level 13 grind. What could be the reason?
The quality of beans? 

Checked zero calibration on DF54 as instructed by Mii coffee youtube video and it's correctly calibrated to zero.

Raffles 1675 build with a 2836.

First time reshaping a case, used a dremel tool to shape it. I think I could have gone more but was a bit impatient! 

Dial and hands aged using coffee grounds + oven. Didn't want to use the weathering kit as I wanted to try to get a softer, creamier lume. Did this for about 40 mins - so 4 rounds of 10 min each at 110 degrees.

The dial lume aged abit more, but was ok with the hands being a little whiter to sort of match the DWO.

For the DWO, I used the little double sided tape that came with some bezels I ordered. Initially tried tamiya cement but that dried too fast. Would recommend the tape as it allowed me to take it off when reworking the keyless.

The toughest part was the keyless! Goodness I think it took me about 10 hours in total, over 4 sessions to get it right. One video from YouTube made it clear for me, missed out making sure some of the parts are interacting together.

Overall a super satisfying build and felt like I've leved up quite a bit!

They say the camera never lies‚Ä¶but I know better.

It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I‚Äôm the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic, those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living..sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling... I capture confidence in its most seductive forms.

It‚Äôs not about posing, it‚Äôs about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera..I‚Äôm your classic Irish mischief-maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half-read book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks, off-the-cuff road trips, and the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I‚Äôm drawn to soul-deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator. Tell me‚Äîwhen was the last time you let someone really see you? And yes, I absolutely swap pics. It‚Äôs kind of my thing.

1obg8ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1obg8ez/my_bf_didnt_tell_me_he_has_a_second_child_other/,"My bf didn‚Äôt tell me he has a second child, other lies and purposeful withdrawal of communication.","Hi Reddit

Apologies in advance this is an ESSAY. My boyfriend (30M) has been lying to me (30F) and misrepresenting things, and I am torn. I love him so damn much and pictured the rest of my life with him but I feel like I‚Äôm losing my self respect. 

My boyfriend has been separated from his ex-wife now for about 18 months. However, he shares a 2 year old daughter with her. They are not legally divorced as this requires 2 years of separation by law in the country I live in.

We have been together for 8 months now, and at the beginning of the relationship there were long talks about his co-parenting situation and relationship with his ex wife. I was assured that the situation is not awfully complex, they have an amicable relationship that they keep for their daughter but otherwise he does not like her as a person due to her cheating and narcissistic behaviour and wishes their co-parenting to be just that and as transactional as possible. He was transparent and communicative about things in the beginning.

However, a couple of months in I had to set a boundary over their communication and time spent in each other‚Äôs houses. I found it inappropriate that he was spending up to two hours at her place during handovers and even on her time sometimes to go and visit his daughter at her house. I felt they had no real boundaries and I wanted to feel he could set some and maintain a healthy degree of separation from her private life, such as her home. She would also often call him crying in the mornings if she was having a hard time, where he would offer to support her by taking their daughter an extra night. While I am fine with extra nights and a flexible schedule, it was the calling crying I wasn‚Äôt happy with as it was clear she still felt emotionally reliant on him. She would also occasionally video call him late at night just to vent about the coparenting, rather than as a video call to see their daughter and other things I felt uncomfortable with. 

It was a constant, where she would come up often and his trauma surrounding his relationship with her would also rear its head. There were other incidents too, for example she demanded to meet me and rather than standing against this he pushed it onto me. A joint birthday party that he wasn‚Äôt forthcoming about talking to me about and other micro interactions of her acting manipulative and demanding that were upsetting. I never reacted unreasonably to any of this however I was struggling to adjust emotionally as I found it all very confusing and I made it clear that I just needed time to understand the dynamic and what was best for his daughter, and that communication was necessary to help me get through it and be more forthcoming with the situation. 

He reassured me all along the way from the beginning of the relationship that this is okay, my boundaries are reasonable and that there is no expectation on me to like her.

Unfortunately, while I do believe he made changes to respect my boundaries here he also withdrew and stopped communicating with me about his ex-wife completely. I didn‚Äôt notice this immediately however the following events made me more sensitive to it. Come to think of it I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the boundaries he created are as there was no follow up conversation, just that I did notice he was spending less time at drop offs and not doing mid-week visits, and she stopped video calling at night (to my knowledge).

Worth mentioning they own a house together (neither of them live in it) which had a whole host of issues relating to the tenants, let alone the fact that he couldn‚Äôt afford the mortgage, and over the course of these months her refusal to sell it was causing a lot of drama. During this time, there was some negative energy from me when her name came up but I had never berated or talked any shit, or had any strong reactions. Just overall discomfort to hear her name come up. Other times I would just not react or say anything when she came up as I didn‚Äôt feel I had anything to add but I wasn‚Äôt feeling negatively about things either. There was one incident where his mum had called about here, where I did react and emotionally expressed to him that sometimes it felt too much, she was always a topic of convo and I was struggling. But I acknowledged he was putting in the effort to make things more comfortable for me and we moved on. From then, communication seemingly stopped. 

Come 6 months down the line, we just got back from a holiday together and one night he comes into my house sobbing. He admits to me that at the start of his separation, so about 14 months ago, he slept with an 18 year old girl and she got pregnant. At the time he was already struggling immensely with the separation and becoming a new parent, and while he told this girl it is her choice what she does with the baby, he refuses to be part of its life and she will have to raise him alone. According to him, he had asked if there was a chance he is not the father and she said there is a chance. In the following months, her family members had tracked down his dad to warn them that this was her plan all along, she had always wanted a baby and was hoping someone would get her pregnant. 

Fast forward and that baby is 6 months old. This woman reaches out to him threatening him that he needs to do a DNA test otherwise she will enforce it with a court order. It is at this point that he comes clean to me, because he is afraid she might track me down too or that it will come to light another way. His excuse for not telling me for 6 months is that he repressed it and never thought about it. 

I asked to see the messages with this woman and he allowed me to. To be honest I was shellshocked and didn‚Äôt really read the messages to verify the whole story. I did notice there was a message from about a month into our relationship though, and when I asked him about it he said he didn‚Äôt see it because he had her account on restricted. This doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because how did he see this recent one then? But I didn‚Äôt press him. I also asked multiple times who knew about this and he assured me just his parents and one of his friends. I chose to empathise with him, I felt awful he was in this situation and that I could understand why this would be hard to bring up. I also gave him an opportunity to come clean about anything else, and I would handle it now, but it needed to be now. He said nothing else and I comforted him, and we spent the night together.

A couple of days later we have another conversation about it and I let him know that I am struggling to process this information but currently I am not angry or upset, I just feel like my trust is broken. In this conversation I confront him about something though - it took him a long time to do his handover before coming to my place and confessing, and he was obviously not in a good headspace so what happened? After some immediate denial I manage to get out of him that his ex wife asked why he is upset and he spent an hour or so talking to her about having to come clean to me. He refused to admit it was ‚Äúconfiding‚Äù in her, and instead wanted to use the word ‚Äúexplaining.‚Äù But the bottom line is he kept this from me, and also lied about who is aware of this situation, as she had known all along. This alarmed me and I told him he crossed a major boundary with this. I asked him if he wants that level of closeness and friendship with his ex wife, he said no. But once again I dropped it and moved on. I told him I want communication and he needs to be patient with me as I‚Äôm in emotional turmoil and this may not be easy. 

We didn‚Äôt really talk about it again, a month passes and I have a very out of character episode. He texted me after his handover was over, telling me his daughter fell asleep in his car so he waited outside his ex‚Äôs house in the car for an hour (during which time I was trying to text him about our dinner plans but he was only intermittently responding), but he just dropped his daughter off and he is on his way to my place now. I crashed out after realizing I was in the dark about everything and struggling to trust him, and accused him of lying to me in a very passive aggressive tone. He immediately put his foot down and said he wouldn‚Äôt tolerate being accused and made to feel like he was doing something wrong and went home instead to process. Later that night he tells me he was done thinking and i ask him to come over. I apologise to him and we talk things through. 

He tells me it is clear I don‚Äôt trust him and I said yes true, and that I felt he has withdrawn communication from me. He tells me he thinks my boundaries are unrealistic and that he has been hesitant to communicate with me because I have made him feel ostracized, because his coparenting relationship is ‚Äútaboo‚Äù and that he felt coveted. He also told me he felt betrayed when I wasn‚Äôt friendly to her during a drop-off at his house and that he feels I have been hostile towards any mention of her. It is important to his coparenting relationship that they have a friendship and can talk about things other than their daughter, and he felt he was losing that because of me. He also needed to spend time at her house occasionally to take care of his daughter and I needed to accept that. 

This is the first time I had heard any of this sentiment or expectation from him at all, I was once again shellshocked. I told him I don‚Äôt understand where these feelings of being ostracised come from and that I don‚Äôt believe I have been hostile, and I explain to him the reasoning for my unfriendly demeanour during the drop-off. I admit I could have been nicer but that was not an easy day for me. I have never once punished him for communicating with me. I also express that up until this point he hasn‚Äôt indicated to me at all he feels this way or there is any expectation on me. But for now, just due to being super sensitive and needing to feel confident that their personal lives are separated from each other I am unwilling to adjust my boundaries. I tell him that with more communication and trust, we can absolutely revisit things.

A day later he comes to me with a situation where it makes the most sense for him to care for his daughter at his ex-wife‚Äôs place for a few hours as she couldn‚Äôt make it home in time due to a job interview. He tells me he organised an hour at the park with his parents so that he could kill time and not spend it all at her house. The reasons are solid, it is best for his daughter, and so I say I understand. I also tell him the park thing isn‚Äôt necessary, there is no difference between 2 hours or 3 it isn‚Äôt about controlling minutes and that it is a grave misunderstanding of my boundary. He expresses he is happy with the way this conversation went and he will continue to communicate with me in this way. This is where things were left.

In hindsight after that conversation I do understand there are reasonable situations where it is best for his daughter and both parents to have time in each others houses and I am willing to revisit this boundary. But I feel conflicted because the lack of communication tells me I haven‚Äôt been respected despite just wanting to understand more before I ease into things. 

Since then I have felt so disconnected from him. I have even picked up a couple times small nothing-lies, like for example about messing up a coffee order (I was visibly disappointed but also said it‚Äôs fine and didn‚Äôt press, he chose to lie to placate me). And just a lack of consideration for me this past weekend which is new. It has been extremely painful as despite everything I love him so dearly, he has become my best friend and I just want so desperately to work on things as a team and get back on track. Throughout our 8 month relationship, his life has been so complex and he has essentially hit rock bottom with sudden unemployment and health issues on top of everything else and I have supported him through all of it, while I came into this relationship with almost no issues or baggage. Yet I am struggling to feel valued and appreciated. He always says amazing words to me about how much he loves me but I feel his actions are not matching his words. 

It is clear we have a massive issue with communication. I also struggle to tell him how I am feeling as at this point I want to push it all down and just enjoy the time I have with him when I can. Also because I just feel so overwhelmingly confused all the time and don‚Äôt know how to express what I am feeling. It is so sad because I feel this entire 8 months our wings of new love and relationship have been clipped and the foundations I thought we were building through the hardship have crashed and burned. I feel scared that more things are being hidden or he will walk further back on more things that he assured me of at the start of our relationship over time.

How do we salvage this so early on?

TLDR my boyfriend has kept me in the dark on critical parts of his life like his coparenting relationship with his ex wife, and also has lied to me about a second unwanted child with a one night stand. I have been begging for communication while I attempt to navigate all of this and also support the relationship, but instead he has withdrawn communication. I feel constantly confused and disconnected from him and ultimately unsafe. But I want to get past all of this because I love him dearly. Is there any advice I can take in to try and salvage this relationship?

1obg7hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kproject/comments/1obg7hn/here_is_the_aim_of_human_civilization_so_do_not/,"here is the aim of human civilization, so do not anymore seek purpose of life and waste time,","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am an INFJ-A,"
Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

I also like Asian women too please message me also!

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I have currently two furniture in that space, but I don't think they look and feel good enough. Since the space is insanely small, I have no idea, if a smaller, 140 cm couch, or a bigger, maybe L-shaped 200 cm couch would be the better choice. Maybe even no couch, just two armchairs instead?

I replicated the layout in a software and I also made photos.

This is the layout of this wannabe living room space:

This is the room in its current state:

I know that a rug, a coffee table and a curtain would give the space a more welcoming feeling, and I'll definitely buy better one of those. But as of right now, I don't think those are enough to turn this a more welcoming space.

I'm pretty sure both the current furnitures should go away, but I have honestly no idea what should I replace them with.

This is a concept I came up with:

The couch in this concept has a 140 cm width. I placed a room divider cabinet to separate this area from the other half of the room. Also placed a rug, which has the same width as the couch. The furniture on the left side remained.

1obg40o,https://chat.whatsapp.com/HXLjtY5xCE76ejOtvXJnUg?mode=wwt,Starting a real Community in Ahmedabad.,"Hey folks!

So, a little backstory  I recently moved back to Ahmedabad after living in Goa for a bit, and I realized what I really missed was community. The kind where you can just show up, hang out, talk about life, share ideas, or sit over chai without it feeling awkward or transactional. This isn't promotional this is my way of genuinely trying to connect like minded people together

Ahmedabad‚Äôs full of amazing people, but somehow everyone‚Äôs scattered  we‚Äôve all got our circles, but not really a space where people can meet just to connect, talk, and belong.

So I decided to start a small community group for people who want that kind of vibe  no agenda, no networking pressure, just genuine people, conversations, and good energy.

We‚Äôre doing our first meetup this Saturday night  super chill, some icebreaker games, good coffee, and hopefully some new friendships.

If you‚Äôre in Ahmedabad and this sounds like something you‚Äôve been missing too, join in from the link at the end. 

Let‚Äôs make this city feel a little smaller, one conversation at a time.

**1. Start with structure.**  
Ask your professor for the required format. Outline it: introduction, 3 chapters, conclusion. Suddenly it feels manageable.

**2. Create a timeline.**  
Give yourself mini-deadlines: one week for research, one for writing, one for editing. Prevents the classic ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later‚Äù spiral.

**3. Use credible sources.**  
Check Google Scholar, JSTOR, or CyberLeninka. Wikipedia = good start, terrible citation üòÑ

**4. Write messy drafts first.**  
Don‚Äôt wait for perfection. Just¬†*write*. Editing is 100√ó easier than starting from scratch.

**5. Take real breaks.**

We were just talking about something random like music and life and out of nowhere they said something that hit me like a truck. They didn‚Äôt even know me but they were brutally honest about how they could tell when someone carries themselves differently, not because people like them but because they own their energy.

It made me realize I spent so much of my life trying to be liked by everyone and constantly adjusting myself to fit in. But the truth is confidence isn‚Äôt about making everyone smile at you or agree with you. Confidence is about standing firm even when people roll their eyes or misunderstand you. It‚Äôs about being okay with tension and knowing your worth even when nobody claps for it.

After that conversation I started paying attention to moments where I felt seen versus moments where I felt approved. And the difference was wild. When I stopped chasing approval my posture, my tone, even my thoughts changed. People noticed because my energy shifted and it wasn‚Äôt about charm or trying to be liked. It was about presence.

I‚Äôm not saying I stopped caring completely but now I get that being likable is optional and irrelevant. Real confidence is owning yourself fully and being okay if some people don‚Äôt get it. That mindset alone has opened doors I never imagined and made me realize being liked is a byproduct not the goal.

Honestly this one conversation taught me more about confidence than any book or workshop ever did. It was messy real and completely unforgettable. And the best part is anyone can have this shift in perspective if they stop measuring themselves by other people‚Äôs reactions.",10,1760958078.0,confidence,1,0.92,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1obfz1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1obfz1y/got_dumped_out_of_the_blue/,Got dumped out of the blue,"Hello, my first post here, just wanted to let it out. Feeling very confused and lost. It was a month and half type of relationship 34M - 27F, I guess one of those where people say, big fire short fuse? We started off very casually, just talking a lot, with each interaction it felt that we are very similar, things that we like and enjoy. Obviously the differences were there, but not in a clashing way, but more like in alternative ways to look at things? And it felt attracting. I was in a very good phase of my life, where I felt that positive things are happening, I was getting along nicely with my relatives, friends, strengthening bonds and making amends, working out, looking after my health, further investing into my creative hobbies, such as painting, drawing and also I was feeling financially stable. The relationship with her felt very natural, like the feeling that this person is so nice to me, I can be myself with her, whatever things I shared about myself, my insecurities she was understanding. Such as me not having my own flat/place, but still renting, not having driving license yet and so on. She also shared her own things, I felt trusted, secured, the feeling that we can both grow and learn from each other. At the beginning I was under the impression, that she really wants to see me as often as possible, we both were initiating things, dates and meetings, but she would often say things like: ""I want to see you again, but don't take it as me being selfish"", in response i would assure her that it's totally fine, I don't mind that as well, to tell the truth even if we already had plans to meet ahead. We live in the same city. We became official, a couple in few weeks, the feelings and the spark was like on another level, and we had this let's say love bombing convo going for the whole time, till eventually one day she said, that she is under a lot of stress and wants time for herself, she was telling me about her controlling mother, how she wants to escape her home, that we both should find a place to live together, but at the same time it should be somewhere close where she lives currently, because of her one year contract with the gym , also a place which accepts dogs, I assured her that it's all understandable and I would like to take this responsibility and look for such place to rent. I wanted to give her space and just let her rest, enjoy her time. I actually wanted the same as well, it felt mutual. Because last week we saw each other like 4 times? Mostly just walking, hanging out during evenings after work. So, the next day, everything starts casually, and in one moment she says how she is not happy to be early in the morning at the office, it's cold, dark and she is annoyed at her colleagues, sends me a picture of her making coffee from a machine and says ""i want to burn the whole f***ing world"", my first reaction was that she probably feels upset and i wrote ""Why? What happened?"" I didn't mean anything bad, was just worried about her. In response she sent me a huge angry text, by saying that, what kind of response is that? I expected a different reply, my friend would've said: ""should i bring the gasoline?"" It's my emotion, don't dig inside of me. I was very confused, because it's the first time she got so angry at me, the tone and everything, got me off guard, i felt very guilty for saying that. But deep down I know for sure, my intentions were not harmful, and i felt that I hurt her. Like i failed her in a way, didn't deliver the right answer? From that moment our conversations from her side started to become more and more provocative, colder. She mentioned before, that she had moments in her life when she had exes who tried to help her during mental breakdowns and she got very angry and pushed them away or ghost them. Once in a joking way, when i was intimate with her, she said: ""I'm a risk"" and i didn't over analized or wanted to think much of it. She always sounded rational and kind. So few days later when we met, she asked me to meet her after work in her favourite cafe, i was expecting a date, where we can talk things through and keep going forward, as usual just have a good time, laugh, smile and come out stronger. At first it was neutral, the moment i saw her, she was distant, no hug, no anything, just sitting at the table with poker face. We talked neutrally, about random things, she showed me her new books, she bought, things like that and when we left the cafe, I wanted to hold her hand, she kinda agreed, we walked and walked, but she was silent, I tried to talk about various things, but nothing was interesting to her, like she was elsewhere. Eventually I felt like should we address us? What is going on? She released my hand, put it in her pocket and said ""you invalidate my feelings"". I was asking how? Please talk to me, I want to learn and understand you better. We sat at the bench in the park and she exploded with things like: i hate when you say sorry, it makes me feel weak, i hate how when we go somewhere you greet people, say thank you it pisses me off, people are scum, when you said what's wrong with that world burning thing? You are not the one suitable for me, you need to stay silent when i say and speak when i let you. The confusing part was, when she interprets me as being not the person she wants or expected, she stops talking, in the silence i tried to tell her things from my perspective and how i think or see things. Maybe it would help if i would just put forward what's in my head? In response she would get even more angry and said ""it's my feelings but you make it all about yourself"". Eventually we just sat in silence, I didn't know what to say, i felt trapped like a minefield where every word i say is bad, and i don't fully understand what i did wrong, like how did it got to this point? I've never seen her like this, it felt like a stranger, I don't know anything about her.. eventually she stood up said that she will bring back all my things and walked away. I came back home heartbroken.. dead inside.. Later after an hour she came to my place, gave me bag of my things, i gave back hers she kinda smiled, turned around and never saw her again. 
We had lots of plans together, future things planned, meetings with friends, trips.. all gone in an instant. It's so strange that, I thought the relationship was stable, good for us both, I really did try to make it work, but probably didn't see any signs it's different for her. Looking back, there were moments when she would do things which I thought a bit odd, but i didn't want to think anything bad of it. Such as her common phrase, ""don't judge me"" she would do some meaningless thing and would instantly use that phrase. We are driving in her car, I'm a passenger, she is making a turn i hold onto something, she would hit me with ""are you judging my driving skills?"" No.. i just like to hold onto something. Once she was stressed by driving, during busy street, i noticed she stops talking when she is concentrated, I don't want to disturb her in those moments, if we are silent for like one minute she would go: what are you thinking right now? Is everything ok? Once she even started saying: do you think of leaving me? Are we done? I'm like, what.. how? Why? Why are you thinking like that? I think, i wanted to make her feel safe and by caring and reassuring everything is fine, I didn't let her to process emotions and just let her feel whatever she wanted to feel. It's tough.. I cared a lot, but at some point she accumulated a lot of unspoken hatred towards me üòû The lesson for me I guess is to be a better listener and never rush in relationships.

""The lovely officer Nadia has informed me that you know who I am?"" The detective laid a manilla envelope on the table. ‚ÄúThat you wish to speak with me about a case I‚Äôm working on.‚Äù

Behind tempered glass, the suspect cocked his head. ""Officer Nadia? First I've heard of an officer Nadia‚Äîlovely or otherwise. She‚Äôs been speaking on my behalf, you say?""

The detective took a long pull from his cigarette. ""Answer the question, please.""

""Yes,"" said the suspect. ""I confess that I do, unfortunately, know who you are."" His hands played with the jewelry-fine chain of his restraints, drawing it out link-by-link from the eyelet in the steel table. ""You are Professor Finnegan Flowers, showrunner of the carnival‚Äôs Evening Freakfest. The circus tents on the boardwalk there. Unless, that is, you're not, presently, Finnegan Flowers. In which case I'm speaking with the dashing Detective Mathers; but Detective Mathers nonetheless shares a physical body with Finnegan Flowers, and more importantly,"" the suspect said, ""the both of you share a body with Limpy Gibbons. *Suspected serial killer* Limpy Gibbons.""

The detective winced, a pain in his side. Lately he‚Äôd grown tired of interrogating mad men, and picked the wrong morning to give up coffee. He eyed the closed circuit camera on the wall and massaged his temple, casually adjusting the device nestled in his ear.

Once he‚Äôd cleared the static, there came the disembodied voices of officers Lester, Nadia.

Nadia: Ask the suspect if he knows about the neck tattoos.

Lester: If you mention the neck tattoos, he'll know about the neck tattoos.

Nadia: Am I going to have to mute you again, Lester?

Across the table the suspect narrowed his eyes. ""Hearing voices, Detective Mathers?""

Nadia: Oh, that‚Äôs creepy.

""Perhaps the many voices of officer Nadia?‚Äù

Lester: He can hear us!

Nadia: He can't, Lester. He just knows we‚Äôre watching him.

Lester: Why do you say my name like that? Why do you say '*no, Lester*' and sigh like everything I say is so stupid. Do you guys even want me working on this case? Because I‚Äôll quit. I'd sooner hand out parking tickets than voice my commentary where it isn‚Äôt want‚Äî

The device went dead, Nadia having wound Lester up for another rant.

The detective frowned at the cigarette in his hand, then the cigarette in the suspect's hand. ""What gave you the impression that I'm hearing voices?"" the detective said. ""Are *you* hearing voices?""

‚ÄúNice comeback.‚Äù The subject grinned. ""But the only voice I'm hearing is yours.""

The detective drew a second cigarette. ""How about you start from the beginning.""

""You want a whole nother recap?""

""I just got here, indulge me.""

Nadia: Detective, we're switching to push-to-talk. A bit experimental. If we start breaking up just signal, clear your throat or something. Tap one of your cigarettes.

Radio silence.

Lester: Nadia, you have to *push the button* to talk. That's why it's called push-to-talk‚Äî

Nadia: What exactly do you think I've been doing, Lester?

Lester: Well the line cut out, so I'm frankly not sure what you're doing.

Nadia: Such a fucking idio‚Äî

The suspect tapped his own ear, twice, and winked.

Lester: Detective, we've got Brent on the line to help with our audio prob‚Äî

The detective sighed.

Nadia: Brent says *click twice‚Äî*

Lester: Green light means we're on again‚Äî

Finally the detective scooped the device out of his ear.

""Driving you mad, aren't they?"" The suspect smiled. ""Those voices in your head.""

""Get on with it,"" said the detective. ‚ÄúRecap.‚Äù

""Right. Let‚Äôs see.‚Äù The suspect mouthed his cigarette and rubbed his hands together. ‚ÄúWell, I suppose I first became aware of your alter, Professor Flowers, in that gaming arena, where he'd lined up carnival midgets like pieces on a chessboard. Let the audience direct the moves. Leapfrog on a chess board, with midgets. White ones and black ones. Painted that way.""

""Checkers.""

""Ahh,"" the subject said. ""So you *do* remember?""

""Negative. I just know you don‚Äôt jump pieces in chess.""

""Well your painted midgets could jump, alright. Fucking ninja midgets. And they could dig, too. You had them digging trenches the whole weekend. And cleaning your room.""

""Did I, now.""¬†

""Your alter Flowers did, for a minute. Had me run the ticket booth. Taking coats for plastic coins, when I wasn‚Äôt cleaning your room.""

The detective plugged the device back into his ear. ""What's a coin like that worth?""

""Outside? Nothing. It's circus money. Like chips at a casino, except each one has your pretty little face on it.""

The detective cocked an eyebrow.

""My bad. Carnival showrunner Finnegan Flowers‚Äô face.""

Nadia: Detective Mathers, we've got our sound figured out. Please keep the earpiece in.

Lester: Yes, Detective, please leave the earpiece alone. We've got everything under control.

Nadia: Lester, do you do this shit on purpose?

Lester: Go on. Get it out of your system.

Nadia: You repeat my comments back at me like an idiot. Control freak.

Lester: I was simply clarifying.

Nadia: You didn't clarify *shit*.

The detective pinched the bridge of his nose.

""How are you enjoying this little game we‚Äôre playing?"" The suspect leaned nearer to the tempered glass. ""I dragged Flowers in for questioning myself, just as you're questioning me. Are you having better luck than I did?""

""I‚Äôd rather be home,"" the detective said. ""With my wife, all things considered.""

The suspect winked again. ""Home to play with your dolly? I trust we're speaking of that handsome bearded woman with the bench press.""

The detective rolled his eyes. He opened the envelope and spread a stack of 8x10 photographs across the table before him. ""Tell me again how you came to work at the carnival.""

""Came to work for you, you mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuper deep cover. Investigating your murders. Those bodies someone found chopped up in a freezer behind the generator behind the tent at your freakshow.""

Nadia: Bingo. Case closed. That's a confession.

Lester: He hasn't confessed to anything.

Nadia: How does he know about the bodies in the freezer if he wasn‚Äôt the one who cut them up and left them there?

Lester: That's exactly what we should aim to find out.

Nadia: Fair point, Lester.

Lester: Shut up, Nadia.

Nadia: I wasn't being sarcastic but like whatever.""

Lester: *Like but whatever*, Nadia.

""Let me see if I have this straight,"" said the detective. ""Concerned about the killing spree, you took it upon yourself to infiltrate the carnival as an employee, interrogated Mr. Flowers, and extracted privileged information about our ongoing investigation.""

The suspect shook his head. ""The interview I conducted with your alter Professor Flowers was of no use whatsoever. And believe me, I put sufficient pain into that man. If he knew what Limpin' Gimpins knows about the icebox killings, then I'd know it too. I‚Äôm frankly surprised to see you walking.""

""If they're not the same person,‚Äù the detective said, ‚Äúthen how‚Äôd you know about the icebox?""

""Has the lovely little Nadia not been listening?"" The suspect leaned toward the pane of glass again. ""*I'm* the one running this investigation.""

Nadia: Insane in the membrane.

Lester: I have chills. Actual chills.  
The suspect peered into the metal table, his blurry reflection. ""The prophet looked upon the dead,‚Äù he said, slowly lifting his gaze toward the detective, ‚Äúand gold poured from his eyes.""

Nadia: What. The. Shit.

The suspect now put an ear to the table. ""Hello? Is there anybody in there?"" And knocked. ""Nadia? Familiar with the words I‚Äôve spoken, Nadia?""

Nadia: Detective, these are the contents of the killer's poetry. Ergo, the suspect is thus the killer case closed congratulations.

Lester: No. Keep him talking, Detective. Ask about the tattoo.

Nadia: I hate that he knows my name.

The top photograph depicted a lifeless woman with an X on her neck. ""Tell me about the tattoos. Is it a cult thing? Is this how the killer chooses his victims?""

The suspect touched his own neck. ""You gave it to me, detective."" He grinned. ""I thought it was Flowers, at first, when he came into the tent with his little black murder of midgets. But then I noticed his walk. The way he walks when he goes mad. Limpy‚Ä¶gimpy‚Ä¶officer Gibbons. The way *you* walk, detective. And then his sasquatch followed, the seven foot bearded woman. She held me down while the blackfaced midgets cooked the iron.""

The detective narrowed his eyes. ""So the show runner brands his victims without their consent.""

""No. The show runner's alter does. The ex cop with the limp in his stride. As for consent, I mean, I can't speak for the dead, Detective, but I certainly didn't volunteer for the privilege. Pretty much blew the deep cover I had going on; hence why I hauled you in, today.""

The detective leaned back and bit his cigarette, drew a second one for the stress. ‚ÄúSo you went undercover as a carny, thinking an ex-cop serial killer called Gibbons was masquerading as the showrunner professor Flowers, got yourself branded like livestock and had his ass dragged to the station for questioning. Is that right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd here we are.‚Äù

Nadia: I can‚Äôt make heads or tails of this.

Lester: Shush.

Nadia: Did you just fucking shush me you little bit‚Äî

""You gonna light one of those, detective?‚Äù the suspect said. ‚ÄúOr just play with them like a little girl.""

The detective patted his pockets. Winced a little.

""See? You still feel that kick to the ribs, don't you?"" The suspect grinned with hot-pink braces. ""I wasn‚Äôt so delicate with professor Flowers when I was the one asking questions.""

""Heartburn, is all,"" the detective said. ""My father gets it. I get it.‚Äù

""You looking for this?"" The suspect raised a lighter and struck a flame, lit another cigarette. ""We don't generally let the criminally insane light things on fire, around here.""

Nadia: What is this?

Lester: Detective, get out. Walk away.

The detective frowned down at himself, at his orange jumpsuit and restraints.

Nadia: What is this?¬†

‚ÄúOh boy oh boy.‚Äù The suspect pulled sleeves back from bare arms and peered down into his reflection in the steel table again. ""How many voices are bonking around in that head of yours, Detective?""

Nadia: Mathers.

The detective stood from the table and pulled at the length of the chain until it jerked. He grabbed a music box and smashed at the pane of glass. ""Who are you?""

""I'm detective Mathers,"" said the suspect into his reflection in the steel table.

The detective struck the glass again and fell through it. The broken mirror spilled down upon the steel table, and the detective followed. He crawled upon the surface and the suspect peered back at him from all the broken pieces.

""What I don't understand,"" said the suspect. ""If you can talk to beautiful little Nadia and I, Detective, why can't we hear from Limpy himself? Is your psyche so splintered? How is the killer off limits to our conversation?""

Lester: Good question.

Nadia: Ew don't wink at me. What the fuck is good about that question, Lester?

Lester: Don‚Äôt ask me.

A pause.

Nadia: Detective. Lester keeps winking at me.

Lester: If you say so.

Nadia: He's winking like there's some big reveal happening. What are you winking about?¬†

Lester: Is it not obvious, Nadia?

Nadia: Spit it out, man.

Lester: I mean my name. Lester Gibbons. Limpy? How have you not put this together?

Nadia: You! Lester‚Ä¶ Do you even work for the police department?

Lester: Nadia, how could more than one of us work at the police department? Are they going to hire us twice?

Nadia: Stop! Shut up! I'm not part of you!

Lester: Little girl, don't make me cut you into pieces with this wedge of broken mirror in our hand.

‚ÄúQuiet,‚Äù the detective said. ‚ÄúPlease. All of you.‚Äù He swept mirror off the table and plucked the device out of his ear‚Äîwhich was a purple jelly bean.

Then a new voice. ‚ÄúNadia?‚Äù

""Who was that?"" asked the suspect. ""Who just said Nadia?

‚ÄúNadia, answer me.‚Äù

The detective sat up and groaned. ‚ÄúYes, mom?‚Äù

The suspect took one long pull on his cigarette. ""The plot thickens.""

‚ÄúWhat was that smashing, young lady?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat smashing?‚Äù said the detective.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt 'what smashing' me, mister. I‚Äôll come right up there and ground you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Momma I have to clean up my mess I just spilled something don‚Äôt come.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever it is, it better clean itself up before I get in there.‚Äù

And faintly from the jelly bean came the tinny voice of Lester. ""I live inside some kid?""

The detective ate that one, poured more into her hand, ate three and stuck the fourth, which was red, back into her ear until it was snug. She picked up and peered into a rather large plate of the broken mirror. ‚ÄúPause game, okay? I have to clean or I‚Äôll be in trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù said the suspect in a gruff voice.

Lester: Please. This can't be real. It's too stupid. I don‚Äôt want to be a manifestation of some little girl with pink braces. Kids don't say manifestation. And yet look, she's doing my voice. She's lip syncing. Why is she doing that!

‚ÄúNadia!‚Äù

The detective twisted and scooped up the envelope and crumpled up several dead body drawings. ‚ÄúDon't come in my room Momma not yet!‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle girl, have you been smoking my fucking cigarettes in front of your mirror again!?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh dear,‚Äù said the suspect.

‚ÄúShush.‚Äù

Anyways here is my review/pros and cons stuff

+ World looks great. (played in medium setting)

+ Movement was smooth and hilarious (diving gave me helldiver flashback)

+ Gunplay was so smooth and easy to handle that my skill issue didn't get on my way to ice multiple people in single solo raid.

+ No friendly fire until you set your friend on fire. (Oops)

+ No dilenma of ""is that a bot? Or is that a player?"" Due to both player and scav/bots being human

+ Down system and raider flare makes coward like me go ""nope I ain't going there""
Being able to extract while downed is genius idea give the people who pitched that idea a raise and more coffee and doughnuts.

+ PvE are scary because they are perfectly balanced to kill you if you shut down your brain. Unlike tarkov lucky headshot from drunken scav just kills you instantly.

+ TTK is longer than 0.001 seconds, creating amazing tension and opportunity to fight back the ambusher.
Also this makes befriending player is easier since they cannot just shoot you in back of your head to kill you instantly.

+- only 1 maps, but now I'm excited to see more map on future.

- can you stop giving me a key for map I cannot access?

- can you stop giving me a blueprint that I cannot access due to station level restriction? (My disappointment is immeasurable, and my days are ruined)

- few bugs are here and there ( I mean that's why we are testing yeah?)

- harvester canister thing sent me to free sky diving tour. (Reported the bug in discord)

I have taken these medications for a bad heart ejection fraction. 
I have had brain fog for a really long time and I wondered if it was due to my medication. So on the 14th of September last month I completely stopped taking them. For the last 3 weeks I have felt absolutely amazing and I haven't had any brain fog. However, since last week I have had a lot of headaches and I have this weird sensation at the backside of my head, the only way I can really describe it, is that its similar to the discomfort you get when you workout. I can't concentrate and its really annoying. When I drink coffee I feel better for a solid 20 minutes then I feel it again. I get 7+ hours of sleep and I have never smoked.

I looked online and medication withdrawals only last a few days. Could it still be withdrawal? I rather not tell my parents and I have no idea when my next cardiology appointment is. When I did go last time they said my ECG and echo was back to normal but they would keep me on medication. I just didn't want to feel the brain fog anymore. I probably should have weaned them off instead of abruptly stopping.

Should I restart what my prescription says to take (or maybe gradually resume the normal dosage) or should I battle out the withdrawal symptoms?

You‚Äôll probably get the same one.

That‚Äôs **mode collapse**‚Äîwhen models keep choosing the most likely answer until every path feels the same.

It happens because of **human typicality bias**.  
During A/B testing, we tend to reward familiar phrasing over odd but valid alternatives.

This lack of diversity forces us to battle clich√©s and predictable tropes, burying the unique voices the AI could otherwise produce.


## üî¨ Verbalized Sampling (VS)

**Verbalized Sampling** is a simple idea:  
Ask the model to explicitly imagine multiple possible responses and assign each a probability, e.g.:

Then, sample from the *less likely* candidates.

1obfv9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1obfv9j/my_friend_told_me_i_ruined_her_graduation_can_i/,My friend told me I ruined her graduation - can I stay friends with her?,"Hello potato queens! Love you Charlotte and congrats on your wedding.

  
So I need advice - All names and places have been changed.

So I (28F) have been friends with Sophie (27F) since we were in high school. She has just graduated as a doctor so I flew to her country to celebrate with her (Thursday - Saturday).

As to be expected, she had family, friends and a party to organise, so was very busy and quite stressed. So communication was quite low and she was snippy a lot of the time. Fine, all good, I get it.

Thursday is the graduation itself, lovely time, we go to the spa afterwards and nap. Awesome day. Friday is where it gets weird...

Another one of her friends arrived on Thursday night, so on Friday morning we all went out to coffee with her 16yo brother (who barely speaks english by the way - absolutely lovely, but he used sophie as a translator a lot of the time). At around 11am she announced she was leaving to teach (she does online tutoring - which is super flexible and she could have moved this) for several hours and left myself, her brother, and her friend who I did not know to 'entertain ourselves' for 6 hours. None of this was discussed beforehand, she just left.

  
Fine... I guess? It was awkward but we made it work. I had been to the city before so acted as de facto guide, using google translate a lot with the brother. It was okay but quite stressful.

  
Friday night was her party. All went well, we met her new beau, and had a grand old time.

Sophie decided to stay the night at her new boyfriend's house after the party. She said also that she would be back in the morning to help clean up the party as it was in her flat. Great.

At 2am I got a text from her asking me to 'help' clean up the party, while she was not there. I asked her if she was coming to help too, but she did not answer. She did not ask her brother to help, nor her sister (17yo) who was also staying, nor the other friend. Just me. So I did, but was upset. Who leaves her party cleanup to her friends and doesn't help at all?

As additional context, she had announced on the Friday morning that her brother's flight back home is in a neighbouring city, over an hour away, and she is leaving on Saturday (my last day) to spend the whole day with him.¬†

So I waited for her to come that Saturday morning, no answer. Her brother then gets a call at 11am telling him to come down, and they need to get their train. That morning I had been organising them, helping him pack, making breakfast for her siblings and cleaning. All by myself, her other friend was passed out hungover.

She drove up to the flat and told her brother to get in, and did not even bother to say goodbye, to me or the other friend. She just left.

For context, I had: organised her gift (arranged 50+ people to contribute money to it), made her a card, paid for her spa pass, loads of party stuff, flown out to see her etc. etc. I wanted to and chose to do all those things, as I care for her very much.

  
However all this combined just felt like a total slap in the face. Had she told me with notice she was going to this other city I would have been fine and would have changed my flights to leave earlier, but with that notice I couldn't. This felt like a massive waste of my time and effort, and I felt abandoned. I also socially was kind of stuck with her friend for the day, without my knowledge, who was also kind of pissed (we both work very high stress jobs and had had to wrangle days off to come and see her, and now she wasn't there).

  
She called to chat about logistics later, and she got my tone that I wasn't happy. She pressed and I said it might be good to talk some stuff through, but I didn't want to put a bummer on her grad day so we could talk in a few days. She pressed and I warned her that I was tired, hungover and emotional and things might not come out hugely well/constructive. She insisted, so I told her how I felt. I didn't yell, I didn't accuse, I told her how I felt about what she did, how I felt she could have communicated more about what was going on, and I did not like her leaving me to clean up her flat/the lack of goodbye thing. Obviously I included the caveat that I knew she was very stressed, and for me her behaviour fell under the category of 'thoughtlessness' rather than actively being mean/rude/nasty. She was very apologetic and I thought that was fine. I accepted her apology and thanked her for listening.

So I spent the day in her city, alone, which was fine but I had said no to 2 birthday parties that day to spend time with my friend in her city.. and she wasn't there..... But at this point I thought the issue with Sophie was solved.¬†

That evening as I am preparing to go to the airport I get a call from Sophie. She is upset. She essentially said I was being hugely unfair, she felt blindsighted, that I was making her feel like a bad friend, that I shouldn't have told her, that I wasn't making exceptions for family, etc. etc. Saying that I had cleaned up her flat before after a party so it made sense I would be okay to do it again (I did, once, when I couldn‚Äôt sleep and woke up early, she hadn‚Äôt asked me). Essentially going back on what she said and throwing insult after insult at me, saying I ruined her grad. At this point I was about to make the 6hr journey back home, on a train station platform, with very very little sleep. I got super upset and told her she was fully aware of the situation and that I said what I said, I got quite upset (but did not insult her in any way) then the train came and I said I had to go and I would talk to her later, then hung up.

It's been two days and neither of us has said anything to each other. Part of me wants to reach out and talk this through, but part of me is heartbreakingly disappointed in her behaviour and reaction to all of this.¬†

So Reddit, did I mess up? was her behaviour reasonable? Should I reach out? I'm really hurt and upset but I'm worried I am blowing this out of proportion.

I am disabled and require assistance. Since May, I have been unable to pay my rent in full. My disability doesn‚Äôt begin to cover the rent, nor the increase that came when my lease expired in September. 

I was approved for an HRA voucher back in May, and have been in search of not only a new apartment, but one in an elevator building, as I am unable to navigate stairs. I‚Äôve had poor luck with real estate brokers/ agents, who have basically ignored my multiple requests to see units that meet the voucher requirements insofar as price goes, and my credit isn‚Äôt awful. I‚Äôve been summarily ignored and legally, there is nothing I can really do, as they can deny ignoring me, even though I have kept fairly decent records of my attempts to contact them and my multiple requests to see properties.

Another point to make is that I cannot really hustle neighborhoods to find potential apartments as some do, as my disability prevents me from doing so. 

I was hoping to stay in my present home, but was unable to get HRA to increase their maximum rent metric. Even with Physician letters and other pertinent documentation, I was denied by HRA. I requested a fair hearing from the state, which took until last month to actually be heard. No decision has been rendered yet. So, I am waiting again. 

In the meantime, my rental arrears have topped a staggering rate. I won‚Äôt tell you how much I‚Äôm behind, but I will say that on Friday last, I was finally served with eviction papers. I saw it coming, but there was very little I could do, financially speaking, to prevent it. 

I reached out to the landlord on several occasions to offer to make payments as much as I possibly could afford in the meantime. The landlord answered my emails, but no matter how I phrased it, he never addressed my multiple proposals to make payment arrangements.

So, I‚Äôll be making a trip downtown to the courthouse to look for legal assistance. 

Here‚Äôs where I back up a bit to explain my potential discrimination case. 

My boyfriend has more or less moved in with me to assist me in packing up my apartment, shopping for groceries and basically doing what I am unable to fully do by myself. Sadly, he‚Äôs financially no better off than I. 

In this process of the inevitable move, he has had a few friends come and help with packing and so forth. The doormen, the superintendent and the landlord have been less than receptive to several of these people. Interestingly, most of the people to which they‚Äôve taken issue have been either Latino or Black. 

Back in late May or early June, one of the doormen stopped my boyfriend in the lobby and proceeded to tell him that ‚Äúyou guys need to stop bringing escorts into this building.‚Äù My boyfriend told him that our friends were NOT escorts, to which the doorman replied ‚ÄúYes, they are.‚Äù He was mortified. He came up and proceeded to repeat the exchange. I went through the roof. I wrote both the super and the landlord and told them in no uncertain terms how infuriated and insulted I was. I also mentioned  that this doorman placed them in legal jeopardy and that if I needed to seek counsel, I would. I received a letter from the landlord, profusely apologizing and the assurance that the doorman would be spoken with. From that day forward, the doorman in question treated me and my boyfriend like dirt. Cold shoulder, the works. Again, I wrote the landlord and told him of the treatment we were receiving. This time, there was no response forthcoming.

A few weeks later, we experienced a very unfortunate situation in which a person, whom neither of us knew, knocked on my door at approximately midnight. He acted as if he‚Äôd been invited, which he had certainly not been. I asked him who he was looking for, and he gave a strange name and I told this person, who was evidently under some sort of influence, he had the wrong person, however, he had the correct apartment number. I closed the door and locked it. He knocked a couple of times and then it stopped. I was going to call the police, but there was no further noise, so we went to bed. I got up early to make coffee and get the paper. As I opened the door, the man in question was sitting against the wall, sound asleep. I woke my boyfriend and we both went downstairs to the front desk to notify the morning doorman. We came back upstairs and watched through the peephole as the doorman roused and eventually ejected this man. 

About an hour later, the super came banging on my door and ringing the doorbell. He spent the next 5 minutes tearing into me - wanting to know what kind of people we were inviting into the building. I attempted to explain that we had no idea who this man was and he was not invited by either of us. The super then told me that this wasn‚Äôt the first time this had occurred. I was dumbfounded and asked what he meant, as we‚Äôd never had anyone else like that knocking on our door. He said that a black man was outside the building a few days earlier sitting on the steps and when asked where he was going and who he was visiting, he gave my apartment number. This was the first I‚Äôd heard of anything like this from anyone. I was a bit confused as to why I had not been notified of this initial disturbance.

I was called the following day by the landlord, who (barely) allowed me to explain what I knew of this situation. He told me that he had no choice but to believe me, as I‚Äôd lived in the building for five years and he‚Äôd never had a complaint before. 

I let it go. About a week later, a sweet friend of ours came to help with packing. Now, this wouldn‚Äôt be remarkable, except the fact that this friend happens to be a very tall, buxom and black transgender woman. She came to assist us, and left late without incident. The following morning, I was awakened by an irate phone call from the landlord, who proceeded to berate me because, reportedly, the person who left my place the previous evening was wearing a bikini bottom and a half shirt. That was what was reported to him by, I assume, the late night doorman. I vehemently denied it and told him that there was nothing unusual in her clothing. He said he‚Äôd have to look at the video and get back to me. He also said he was tired of receiving complaints about my unit. I told him I was tired of receiving misrepresentative reports about my guests. He said from that point on, he instructed the doormen to just call the police if there were further incidents. 

It was at that point, he offered me a deal, which for some reason reeked of dishonesty. He told me if I would be out in 2 weeks time, he‚Äôd cut my arrears in half. Now, usually, if this were feasible, I‚Äôd have jumped at it, but I had no place to go, and everyone I spoke with said this offer seemed fishy and that it would be best to let the system play out as it was supposed to.

I wrote the landlord and advised him that the clothing my trans friend was wearing happened to be a t shirt, a pair of bike shorts and tights, which was not unusual considering that she was on a bicycle. I told him her clothing would not be out of place in a gym or in the park. No response.

By this time, the doormen began treating all of my guests like they were lepers. Making them all sign in and show ID. Oddly enough, this hadn‚Äôt applied to anyone else‚Äôs guests. One day, a Latino friend was made to wait on the street (ostensibly because he had an electric bike) until I came downstairs to get him.

In the coming weeks, nothing of note happened. We did have a friend from out of town come to stay with us along with his big, sweet Staffy Terrier. Again, nothing to note, except that he is black. One evening, he was preparing to take the dog for a walk, he cracked the door, and the dog got away from him and ran down the hallway. He got a handle on her right away, no harm, no foul, right? 

Nope. Within 10 minutes, the door went bang banging and the doorbell began ringing rapidly. That‚Äôs always been the calling card of the super, who began yelling at me over a non-incident. Evidently, a neighbor at the end of our hall, with a notoriously aggressive German Shepherd, saw the dog and immediately complained to management. I calmed the super down and he then told me to expect a call  from the landlord, who would not be pleased. I replied ‚ÄúSo, what else is new?‚Äù

Our doormen now will actively ignore some guests - particularly those with darker skin. 

As I mentioned, I was just served with the eviction notice, and although I knew it was coming, it still stings a bit - especially with the way I and my guests have been treated like second class citizens.

I have documented everything I could in emails to the landlord. Every response and non-response from him.

I am going to have to answer the suit. Question is, do I mention all of this obviously discriminatory treatment, or do I do that separately? 

Thanks for bearing with me if you made it this far. I‚Äôd be very interested to hear your thoughts.",0,1760956174.0,NYCapartments,5,0.33,False
