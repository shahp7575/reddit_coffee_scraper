1nhc2ja,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhc2ja,Moscow Sheremetyevo airport experience as a foreigner,"
First trip to Russia (I'm Chinese) and I'm travelling with my family. Even though next to nobody spoke English or Chinese, everyone was much friendlier than expected. We could grab our luggage really quick and the airport signs were clear, staff helped us get to the exits.

We were staying at cosmos selection hotel which is linked to one of the terminals and I explored that terminal a bit on my own. It was mostly closed idk why with only a few shops. I got a coffee at Drinkit, which was one of the few stores open. The girl behind the counter was super cute, even though she didn't know much english she still tried to communicate via hand gestures and Google translate. We had a short conversation and I was surprised to learn we're both 20. Lowkey regretting not getting her number lol

Afterwards I walked to hotel via the linked walkway and worked out in the gym. The staff were also very helpful in showing me where the gym is and even gave me a free water.

Overall great experience, would come again

honestly, i don't want to see this job as something not worth my time and that i'm just gonna be in it for the money because i'm genuinely curious about the art of coffee and how i should improve my work so that i'll be able to serve good quality coffee and not some shitty concoction made by me because i have no knowledge of what i'm handling.

it's my first job and i don't want to fuck it up for myself and the customers, especially since my interest in coffee started just about a few months ago. i would really appreciate any knowledge from experienced people, maybe some questions i should ask for my managers, some advice on which books/articles to read to get myself into coffee, proper techniques, work ethics, anything at all for an introverted barista who wants to invest his time in the industry lol.

**TRIGGER WARNING:**  >!extreme jealousy. Obsessive behavior!<

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!incredibly disturbing!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/xzqzcPdgqK)  **Jan 4, 2016**

Throwaway because I don't want this connected to my account. 

I just want to start by saying that I realize I might be totally wrong and insecure in this situation. I just really want another perspective or something because I just can't help the fact that this bothers me and I am admittedly feeling jealousy.

I have been with my boyfriend for 6 months at this point. He has 4 siblings (3 brothers and 1 sister) and we are the shortest relationship in the family. 3 of his siblings are married and another is in a very long term relationship, I think the shortest relationship in the bunch is 5 1/2 years. So I will admit I am a bit intimidated and insecure there.

For Christmas this year his sister in law made him a homemade plushie of this little blue baby dinosaur looking character from his favorite game Guild Wars. The plushie is amazing quality and he absolutely loved it. But she didn't make one for any of the other boys who also love the game just as much. Not even her husband. In fact she went out of her way to give it to him without his other brothers around except for her husband. Her husband was just as excited for her to give his brother the gift as she was but it just felt off to me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Why would she work so hard on something for my boyfriend and no one else? And it just felt like such a personal gift that I could never match and I just feel like she totally took away from what I gave him. 

I did try talking to my boyfriend about it and how I thought it was weird. He said he didn't think it was weird at all because she has always been closer to him than the other brothers. Well shouldn't she be closer to her husband than him? He didn't get one. I don't know. I asked him if he would give it back to her saying he can't accept it and he refused and said I'm being ridiculous. I just feel like a woman doesn't make such a personal gift for a guy unless they see them as something more. It was just how I was raised and I hate feeling this way about something like this. I talked to my mom and sister and they both agreed that it wasn't right and that this was most likely the beginning of her trying to push me out. I just can't help but feel like she was trying to make him like her more than me because he said she has never given him anything before and this is our first Christmas together. I just don't know what to think. Or if I'm overthinking this completely.

Tl;Dr: Boyfriends sister in law gave him a homemade plushie that she put a lot of work into for Christmas and didn't make one for any of his other siblings. I feel like this means she is attracted to him and is trying to win him over now that I am in the picture. Am I overreacting?

> You're reading way too much into this. As someone else said, there may be a backstory on in-joke there that you don't know about.  Also, it's entirely possible that she's working on gifts for everyone else.  If it's as nice as you say it probably takes a while to make so maybe she ran out of time.

> ""I talked to my mom and sister and they both agreed that it wasn't right and that this was most likely the beginning of her trying to push me out.""
>
> WTF?  She's happily married to his brother and gave him the gift in front of her husband and you think she's trying to ""push you out?""  That's some master level insecurity there.

**OOP**

>>I guess the time thing is a good way to look at it. It does look very professional I don't sew so I really don't know how long something like that takes. And that's just how my mom has raised us. She has always been very protective of our father. I try not to be her because I know she can be a bit much at times but this situation just completely threw me off. And it's honestly hard to see his other siblings significant others fitting into the family unit so well while I'm just the outcast.

**[deleted]**

>>>If anything I'd say that your mom is trying to drive a wedge between you and your boyfriend's family.  Even if she's doing it unwillingly.

**~**

**wemblewobble**

> You are over reacting.  Being a jealous, paranoid and controlling girlfriend will drive him away.  You've been together 6 months and you're already trying to determine what presents he's allowed to receive from his family?  That's crazy.  You are the one making up a wedge to drive between you and his family, not her.
>
> Calm down.  It's a stuffed animal, not a blow job.  Which is probably what her husband got and why she didn't gift it in front of you.

**OOP**

>>It wouldn't have bothered me if it was from his actual family it's just that it's the significant other of his brother that bothered me. If his actual sister made it for him I would never in a million years have asked him to return the gift.

**studiocistern**

>>>An in-law IS actual family. And you do yourself no favors by making those kinds of distinctions. My sister-in-law is my family and I'd be really annoyed if someone tried to tell me that she wasn't. 

**OOP**

>>>>That's just a really hard distinction for me to make honestly. His one brother has been in a long term relationship for 7 years. They do not plan to marry. Yet this sister in law has been with her husband for 5 1/2 years. She hasn't been with the family for as long as the other one who isn't married so how is she more their family than the other girl who has been around longer? Just because of documents? I always viewed marriage as the couple making their own family unit. 

**studiocistern**

>>>>>This hair-splitting about ""who is more his family"" is really weird. She is married to his brother. She is family, it doesn't matter if they've been married for five minutes or fifteen years. The woman who is in a longterm relationship with his other brother is also family. No one is ""more family"" than the other. It's not a pH level, they're familial ties.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/hlLzy88Eib)  **Feb 4, 2016 (1 month later)**

My first post wasn't popular by any means but it got a decent amount of comments so I figured I'd update.

I went a few weeks without saying anything else about the subject because everyone on here seemed to disagree with my side of things. Then last Saturday he told me he was going to be spending the day at his brothers just to hang out. We generally make plans on Saturdays but I hadn't had the chance to make plans official with him yet, I just figured it was implied at this point. So I asked him if I would be allowed to go over there with him. That's when he told me that it was just going to be a day with him and his brother. So I reminded him that since it is his brothers house then most likely his wife will be present too so I didn't really see how it was fair. Ultimately it blew up and I told him everything, brought up the gift again and just how I feel intimidated by everyone and feel like his sister in law is on some pedestal or something because she gets to be there and I don't. I also mentioned how I just felt like I was being pushed out by her and that the gift made me uneasy.

He was frustrated and told me that he was going to his brothers and that he would talk to me later. So I spent all morning Saturday on edge and just completely jealous. Then around 1pm his sister in law called me (I guess he gave her my number) and asked me if I was free to meet her for coffee. I was confused but agreed to have coffee with her. I expected it to be awkward.

At the coffee shop she wasted no time to tell me that my boyfriend had told her everything. She said she wanted to meet for dinner because she wanted me to see her face and see that she was genuine in everything she had to say. She went on to explain that she had no feelings for him in the way I was implying to him and no intention of pushing me out. She said her original plan was to make the plushie for all of the boys since they all play the game but it took her way too much time to make one so she wanted to give it to her favorite brother in law. I questioned why not her husband and she said that she lives with him and he knew she was making it in the first place and that she could make him one any time and just wanted that one to be a surprise Christmas present. I told her that I still kinda thought it was inappropriate since he was in a relationship now and she just paused and didn't say anything for a few seconds. Then she asked me if there was anything else that was bothering me. I used today as an example and said it bothered me that he went to her house and told me I couldn't come because it was a day with his brother even though she would obviously be there. She told me that it is a day with his brother and that just because she lives in the house doesn't change that. She said that she kept to herself doing her own things while the boys played video games with each other and that my boyfriend came to her when she was in the kitchen to talk to her about me briefly. 

I didn't say anything. I still felt a bit jealous but I just didn't know what to say. She then asked me if I had anything else I wanted to get out and I declined. She said that she didn't want to part ways without giving me some advice. She went on to say that she thinks I'm a very nice girl and that the entire family feels that way and wanted to remind me that all of the spouses and significant others were new to the family at one point in time. She went on about how it takes time to feel a closeness with everyone and that she went through it too. She then said that she didn't want to come across the wrong way but that I needed to work hard on my insecurities or else I would lose my boyfriend. She just went on and on saying how I am so nice and that I am ruining a good thing by letting myself overthink these things and by being so insecure. She told me to really think about how I am acting over his own sister in law interacting with him. That's when my stupid brain made me say ""Well if you were to get a divorce then you wouldn't be his sister in law and you would just be another woman in his life."" that was the moment it finally hit me just how crazy I was being. She gave me this look and said ""Well we aren't getting a divorce so...."" and I just felt completely embarrassed and apologized. She then very nicely told me that on second thought she thinks I might not be ready for a relationship at all and that I really need to work on myself. That was pretty much the end of it and we parted ways. I spent the rest of the weekend crying and hating myself. My boyfriend didn't call me or text me at all. 

Finally on Monday he asked if he could come over. So he came over and asked how it went with SIL and I had figured he knew everything but he said that all she said was that he needed to talk to me. Turns out he didn't talk to me all weekend because he was angry with how I acted about him going to his brothers house then bringing up the gift again and he just needed some space. He told me that he wasn't going to put up with this type of behavior and that it is putting way too much unnecessary drama into his life. As I'm sure you are probably guessing, he proceeded to break up with me. He told me he really cared about me but he just can't imagine how bad it will get in the future if I'm already acting like this with people who are his family. I begged him not to leave and that I would do everything to change and he just wouldn't budge. 

I haven't heard from him since and I feel like I had my heart ripped out and stomped on it hurts so bad. And I know this is all my fault. I have my mom and sister telling me how it's good riddance and how he broke up with me so that he wouldn't have anything holding him back from his SIL and this just broke me. I am so done with my family and the way they put these toxic ideas in my head. I'm just done. So yeah. Not a happy update. From here I am planning on working on myself and hope to someday maybe convince him to give me another chance. I don't know why I wrote this update. It just feels good to get it out I guess and further convinces me I need to change.
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriends sister in law asked me to meet for coffee and convinced me I was being unreasonable but it was too late. Boyfriend dumped me and my mother and sister are insane. I hope to work on myself and get him back.

**TOP COMMENT**

**Metsgal**

>I'm won't sugarcoat this, you acted crazy. That being said, you seem to be somewhat aware that this isn't normal behavior, so I suggest allowing yourself a little time to grieve the relationship and then move on. You should look into a therapist who can help you would through these jealousy issues, but this is a lesson learned.

1nhbtdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1nhbtdn/patriarchal_season_with_respect_to_kitchen_duties/,Patriarchal season with respect to kitchen duties,"In last night‚Äôs livefeed many misogynistic statements were passed with respect to women in the house and kitchen duties.

These contestants have made women in kitchen their servants and keep on adding on extra duties and dishes. If neelam or kunika are extra and want to make 5 dishes and extra things for you thankless fools doesn‚Äôt means other contestants will also do they same. They have also come on bb to play not some cooking show to feed you chapphan bhog or deep clean kitchen.

Men this season are absolute thankless cribbers. Stand and do all these duties on day in the kitchen to see how tough cooking for 17 people is.

So many misogynists and pick mes this season. 

And why is bigg boss sending so much ration that the housemates are demanding 1 non veg dish, 1 veg dish, dal, rice, chappati, sweet dishes daily. The contestants can‚Äôt even make tea coffee for themselves and keep asking neelam for it. And if neelam is doing it for her friends and wants to do it it‚Äôs her choice doesn‚Äôt mean other cooking team also has to keep up with extra tasks. Kunika‚Äôs statements like these girls don‚Äôt have feminine side if they can‚Äôt cook extra, girls should eat after guys etc are extremely patriarchal. Why can‚Äôt the men of the house with duties like sweeping beedroom or garden help them with deep cleaning fridge etc. why is it always the responsibility of kitchen team to do all extra chores when they are also here to play. 

Season 15 even though flopped but was 10 times better in this terms with teja, nishant, rajeev adatiya cooking, pratik simba and other contestants making their own extra dishes, and  other contestants like karan, umar, rakhi, shamita etc. helping in chopping. This is what equality is unlike this season where a women‚Äôs feminine instincts are judged based on their cooking. Unfortunately men this season only like the women who are submissive and keeps doing their work. High time women contestants get out of the kitchen this season.",19,1757908659.0,biggboss,6,0.91,False

Fully able bodied, other than maybe the fact that I sprained my knee a few weeks ago but that's almost fully healed. I am neurodivergent but it doesn't necessarily stop my productivity, it stunts my social skills and I have to do/have certain things to do them, but that's as simple as doing it alone and putting plates away in a certain rhythm. What I'm saying basically is that I can do stuff. 

I only have one chore, even though I could hypothetically do others, my chore is to load the dishwasher. I am autistic and wet feelings overstimulate me quickly, so the fact that I'm doing the dishwasher at all is saying something. The fact that anyone is doing their chores is saying something. 

My mom says she is not going to let us switch jobs because ""once we're good at one job, we'll do another"" but the jobs she makes us do feel very targeted about what disabilities we have. 

My older sister has POTS, which makes her pass out randomly. A doctor has told her not to lift heavy or sharp things above her head due to this. And my mom assigns her to unload the dishwasher, which includes putting sharp things into a knife box above her head and putting dishes up in cabinets that are also above her head.

My brother has issues with a need for stability and he also has anger issues. His job is to take out the trash, with trash bags that are cheap (easily rippable) and my parents won't let him take it out unless it is stuffed to the brim. 

They won't let us swap jobs either, even though I'm happy doing the laundry and my brother wants to do my job. My mom said I can't do the laundry because ""everyone does their own laundry"" when they don't and she ends up doing it, and when I said everyone can clean their dishes and I can do the laundry, that's ""no! I would have to do everyone's dishes"". I genuinely think she just wants it to be harder so we never prove that we're willing to do anything. 

I don't complain a lot when I do either. I only really say anything rude when they scream at me about it, treat me like I'm lazy while I am doing it or I'm stressed in some other way because of them. My parents keep acting like I do nothing though and it makes me not want to anymore. 

It's my mom especially, it feels like she overworks herself just to say ""you won't do anything for me! I hate you, fuck off I hate you!"" etc. she genuinely said that a few days ago while I was doing the dishes, because I said I'd do them later (I don't even say that a lot) and she immediately started screaming at me to do them, she didn't stop screaming until halfway through because she wanted to smoke so she went outside. 

Anyway, I was on my phone a hour or two after doing my chores and my brother was talking to me while my dad yelled across the house to clean the table for dinner (it was cleaning day so we had a lot of chores). He was angry, but more because he was fighting with my mom so his tone was already angry. 

So me, my older sister and my brother went to clean the table. My parents were still fighting while we were doing that, they eventually stopped a bit after I went to make drinks though. That may be because I was in with them. The last few nights, my parents have been angry that one of us haven't made the drinks, so I went ahead and did it so that wouldn't happen. 

My parents stopped yelling a bit after I went in there and were waiting for me, but I thought they were serving food. I already poured my cup by then so I hollered asking if anyone wanted tea, because it was either that or water, and my brother asked for some along with my little sister. 

My brother got his cup, while I got mine along with my sister's, because there were three cups. As I'm trying to sit down, my grandma hands me her cup and asks for tea, so I get back up again. This is because she's in a wheelchair and there's a step down from kitchen to dining room. It's not super extreme and she can get over it, but it's enough for her to struggle a good bit with it. 

Every time I get her something to drink, I have a habit of scrubbing her cup clean beforehand. Her cup reaks because even though she HAS a aid who is SUPPOSED to stay for three hours to help her bathe, get her medicine, make her coffee and make sure she's okay in the morning, her aid sucks. 

Her aid is outside of the bathroom door and sometimes not even in the house when my grandma bathes even though my grandma is missing a leg (making her a fall risk), she stays for like 30-40 minutes at most and she doesn't even wash my grandma's cup before putting drinks in it. Plus I'm pretty sure she's stealing our dishwasher pods (one of my chores are to do the dishes so that's how I noticed) 

Her cup is horrifically disgusting, I mean I will scrub it so much and eventually when I do give up, it still reaks enough to make me gag. I think there's mold in there, and I've told my grandma about it, but I can't deal with mold, neither can she and my parents think she's lazy. 

I spent a good while just trying to scrub it as well enough as I can to get some drink residue out before putting tea in there, to the point that people got irritated at waiting. 

My mom walked in because I wasn't going to the table, and she told me to leave it. She said to just get another cup. So I tried to rinse it off to give it back to my grandma without soap and my mom yelled ""leave it"" at me, cuz she actually meant to leave it in the sink. 

So I quickly poured my grandma another cup, gave it to her and sat down. My mom told her off about that, about how ""I was breaking my wrist trying to wash her cup because she won't wash it"" 

Mom was clearly stressed out, worked up from the fight I guess. I offered to serve the food since she was getting angry about how no one was doing it for her, and she said no because it was the mania. 

I only knew the term ""mania"" from BPD, so when my brother asked what that was, I said it was, in short, a lot of energy built entirely off stress. I don't know if that is wrong, but my dad said that it was wrong. 

My mom said that ""she has no energy"" so I said that I only knew the term from BPD so maybe I got it wrong. She looked at me like I was both stupid and saying something insulting before saying that apparently she has BPD, something I never knew in the 16 years that I've known her. 

So I'm obviously confused and kind of shocked because what do you mean you had a disorder and I didn't even know it existed until 4 years ago after I started to learn stuff like LGBTQ, disability, etc off the Internet? Yes I am professionally diagnosed with ASD, before anyone assumes I'm self diagnosed. I wasn't told a lot about what my condition is either, and I still don't know what symptoms are to what disorders when I was diagnosed mainly in young childhood. 

I ask her why this never came up and why she never told me and she said that she ""doesn't go around telling people her issues"". Yeah I can tell that much, she bottles everything up and then screams at me or our dad when she's angry. 

A few minutes later, we're eating and my brother says something that makes her angry, I don't remember what but I know I was shocked when he said it. She told him off about it, about how she does everything in this house. 

She does this a lot, she'll avoid help for stuff while complaining about how no one ever helps her and then if you criticize that, she'll scream at you for it. She's also manipulative about it. 

Whenever I bring up any issue I have, ""OH I'M SO MISERABLE BECAUSE YOU EXIST AND YOU'RE A LEACH AND I STAY IN MY ROOM ALL DAY WISHING YOU WERE GONE"" and I just said she has been aggressive today. Like she's just jumping on the opportunity to tell everyone she can about how they ruined her life. 

So when she brought up about how ""she served this food with no help after slaving in the kitchen without a helping hand either"" I said that it feels like she does stuff just to say she did it. I wasn't aggressive about it, in fact I said it kind of quietly. I didn't mumble and I wasn't trying to make her not hear me, but it was quiet. 

That caused my mom to ask me what I just said, like that angry kind of asking, and then my brother repeated it by telling her what I said. My brother doesn't understand tone well, he's also autistic, so he didn't really read that the question wasn't genuine. 

My dad then said ""I fucked up"" and said ""I'm gonna end up doing slave labor over that"" while laughing. 

I guess my mom took that as ""you do nothing, fuck off I don't need you"" because she reacted as if I said that. She said that she'd make me realize what she does all day, I guess that means I'm doing a bunch of chores tomorrow. 

My dad asked me what makes me think I can speak to my mother like that, as if I called her a slur instead of saying how I felt. I didn't answer initially because I wanted to avoid any more confrontation that I already had, it's a shut down thing I guess. 

He waited for a good moment before he went on his own rant about how ""if she and him do nothing- (NOT WHAT I FUCKING SAID)- then he'll take away my phone service and electricity"" and I find that ironic. 

Because what I was saying is ""I feel like you only do stuff to complain about us not doing stuff so we can seem inferior to you"" and my father's response (the response of a man who claims he's trying to be emotionally available for us and I just am never there so it's actually my fault whenever I bring it up but never talks to me unless I angered him btw) is to say what he does for me, which is only paying my phone bill and paying electricity. As if that's the support he's failing to give me by working all day and not interacting with me when he is here. 

Then I said that he wouldn't like my answer, which was ""because I don't respect or even like you"" he said to tell him, and I just chickened out and said ""I don't know""

I find it ironic that this is their answer, because when I was severely depressed and suicidal (without a therapist mind you), they constantly asked me why I wouldn't tell them anything and they made me feel like it was my fault that they didn't help me because I wouldn't tell them the problem. 

But now, whenever I tell them a issue I have, no matter how aggressive or calm I am, no matter how big or small the issue is, they treat me like I just told them to fuck off and kill themselves. 

Am I the asshole? I got a bit angry at the end of explaining it, but I hope you get my point. ",2,1757908216.0,AITAH,1,0.75,False

A high school aged drama/comedy set during October that shows the day to day lives of teenagers and real struggles, but also these kids have the love they have for each other and they have escapism through entertainment. The script is almost complete. Wanted to share because that was such a wonderful day when that idea hit me. It was one right after the other!

Tonight, I wrote some thoughts I had about David and how I‚Äôve been adopting some of his lifestyle choices into my own life and I wanted to share that with y‚Äôall.

David Keith Lynch is my biggest inspiration in not just filmmaking, but in life. Don‚Äôt rush, be patient, be kind, be collaborative, but don‚Äôt compromise your ideas. Don‚Äôt live in misery or propagate misery out into the world. Anxiety, fear, guilt, shame, and fatigue scare the ‚Äúfish‚Äù (ideas) away. Don‚Äôt live in that space and don‚Äôt create that enviroment. It‚Äôs anti-art and anti-life. This is why I must get out of my toxic and fearful roommate living situation that I‚Äôve become insnared in over the past four years. I stopped creating, I stopped putting myself out there, and I stopped living. I had dreams and unfortunately some of them can never be accomplished anymore (such as meeting my hero), but a lot of my dreams can be accomplished and can take on different forms. I have adopted his meditative approach as well as a stable daily diet. I have been eating the same food every day because if you get the fundamentals taken care of, you have more space for creative thinking. 

This is what i eat in a day:

Breakfast:

2 packets of oatmeal with milk as a base with 4 tablespoons of flaxseed mixed in, a cup of frozen berries, and on top 2/3 cups of greek vanilla yogurt.

Lunch:

3/4 cups of brussels sprouts, six stalks of asparagus - steamed. 2 cups of spinach. Topped with tofu all in a bowl with Bragg brand liquid aminos on top with two cans of tuna fish.

Snack:

1 cup of mixed nuts

Dinner: 

Brown Rice and quinoa with vegetable bouillon, broccoli and liquid aminos.

Drinks:

Water, Milk, Coffee, Green Tea with Lemon, and Camomile Tea.  

There might be additions, but that is my main menu.

I hope you enjoyed reading and I hope you have a great day!

What I understand is that Quantity is the amount of milk used and Intensity is the strength. Now here is the real question..., does the Intensity simply extract more hot water on the same 250g of coffee, OR does the intensity change the amount of coffee that is ground into the basket and therefore the water extracts relevant to that?

I now find out she has been callilng and demanding to meet his siblings and be part of their lives... and she also called them screaming and crying and demanding a video call, to which they obliged not knowing who she was.

She met up with my daughter for coffee and told her not to tell me (she did tell me) and pumped her for information about me and the extended familyl. She woke me up at 3am with random text insults.. saying things like my spouce hated me and that i was a terrible mother and person all around.  I was in shock.  

I told her she needed to stop, blocked her on all socials, and my phone, but she kept texting from random numbers saying that she was the love of his life and I am nothing.... etc. etc.  Then she posted in a friend group meet up on Facebook how my ex would have loved to come to the gathering, having my friends question who she was.  She is trying to creep into all areas of our shared life and it's getting to a point where I wonder if she watches me when I go out with friends.

We‚Äôve had a mostly respectful connection, but recently things have gotten really complicated due to his family.

Long story short: my fianc√© and I had discussed some practical things about marriage ‚Äî like budgeting, living arrangements, and compromise on both ends. I even said I‚Äôd support him if things didn‚Äôt work out financially, and he said it means living with his parents for a while which is fine. He wants traditional gender roles which I‚Äôm fine with, men as providers and women as nurturers because it works well (and because he can‚Äôt cook or do laundry). Although I accepted my role and even offered to help financially since he has a low income (even though he‚Äôs in web developing/IT), he seemed to have a problem with the idea of providing. He made a list of everything I might need (which wasn‚Äôt much, btw), shared every detail with his family, even personal items, and waited for their approval. Also, I can‚Äôt really work there until I‚Äôm stable.

His family has been micro-managing his affairs, guilt-tripping, and ridiculing us from the start, calling it ‚Äútradition‚Äù, and we‚Äôve been nothing but tolerant.

His family took bits of that conversation out of context and called mine in what felt like an interrogation ‚Äî accusing me of being demanding, implying I wasn't a ""simple girl,"" and even making vaguely threatening comments like ""she better smarten up or it‚Äôll be called off."" My fianc√© listened to the call but stayed silent. Later, he told me he didn‚Äôt know where his family got those ideas and admitted they were exaggerated, but still didn‚Äôt defend me or anything during the actual call. Maybe out of fear.

There have been other similar incidents where our convos were relayed. He said that it‚Äôs in their tradition for them to be involved, set Mehers, and etc. they also sought out personal info about us behind our backs and it‚Äôs just been stressful because they flip the narrative and act innocent. Mind you, this family‚Äôs been in the West for very long time. In the beginning we even suggested that traditionally the guy‚Äôs family buys the bridal dress, and they opposed that saying that‚Äôs not the way it runs in their family. They weren‚Äôt directly communicating that with us too, it was through the son, who knows nothing about traditions/customs either. In return, they asked for dowry, which we were gonna give them as a kind gesture anyway, but like why ask?

When asked, I‚Äôd also share my day to day like coffee runs, eating out, things he does himself. They tainted me to have too much going on.

**State of Awareness**: Security, love, and fulfillment.

This person‚Äôs awareness is rooted in the state of *already being* in a loving, committed relationship with the SP. They assume they are worthy of love, that the SP loves and values them, and that the relationship is harmonious and mutual.

* **Thought Patterns**: They think from the end, imagining scenes of being happy and secure with the SP. Thoughts like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so happy together‚Äù or ‚ÄúThey love spending time with me‚Äù dominate their mind. They don‚Äôt dwell on doubts or what the SP is doing.
* **Emotional State**: Calm, confident, and content. They feel loved and secure, regardless of external circumstances. Their happiness comes from within, and they radiate self-assurance and peace.
* **Actions**:
   * They communicate with ease, texting or calling the SP without fear of rejection, and their messages reflect confidence and warmth.
   * They don‚Äôt obsess over the SP‚Äôs responses because they assume the SP is eager to connect with them.
   * They prioritize their own well-being, engaging in hobbies, self-care, or social activities, knowing the relationship is secure.
   * They act as if the relationship is already perfect, showing affection and appreciation naturally without forcing outcomes.
* **External Reality**: The SP mirrors their assumptions by being attentive, loving, and committed. They initiate contact, plan dates, and express affection consistently. The relationship feels effortless, with mutual respect and love flowing naturally.
* **Example Scenario**: They wake up feeling grateful for their relationship, imagining a sweet moment with the SP. They send a loving text and go about their day, confident the SP will respond warmly. Later, the SP calls to plan a date, and they spend time together feeling connected and appreciated. If the SP is busy, they don‚Äôt spiral into doubt, trusting the relationship‚Äôs strength.

**Core Assumption**: ‚ÄúI am loved, valued, and in a fulfilling relationship with my SP.‚Äù

  
This was following on from my last Post about ""trying to manifest a SP and being Breadcrumbed.   
Post here [Breadcrumbed By SP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentaldietmastery/comments/1mpmiug/identities_series_trying_to_manifest_a_sp_and/)

Here is how you shift from the old state to new state : 

# Start the Day in the End

* **Identity 1 Behavior**: You wake up checking your phone immediately, hoping for a text from the SP. If there‚Äôs no message, you feel anxious or unworthy, starting the day in a state of lack.
* **Identity 2 Shift**:
   * **Practice**: Begin your day with a 5-minute visualization. Close your eyes and imagine a scene implying the relationship is already yours. For example, picture you and the SP laughing over coffee, feeling loved and connected. Feel the joy and security as if it‚Äôs happening now.
   * **Example**: Instead of reaching for your phone, sit quietly and visualize the SP saying, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù while holding your hand. Let the feeling of being loved wash over you. Then, affirm silently, ‚ÄúI am in a loving, committed relationship with \[SP‚Äôs name\].‚Äù

# Handling Texting and Communication

* **Identity 1 Behavior**: You compulsively text the SP, overthink their responses (or lack thereof), and feel crushed if they don‚Äôt reply quickly. You might send multiple messages or analyze their tone for clues.
* **Identity 2 Shift**:
   * **Practice**: Text or communicate from a place of confidence, assuming the SP is excited to hear from you. Limit over-texting and focus on quality interactions. If you feel the urge to chase, pause and redirect your energy.
   * **Example**: Instead of sending, ‚ÄúHey, you there?‚Äù out of anxiety, send a warm, confident message like, ‚ÄúJust thinking of you, hope your day‚Äôs going great!‚Äù Then, let go and assume they‚Äôll respond lovingly when ready. If they don‚Äôt reply right away, affirm, ‚ÄúThey love hearing from me and always respond with affection.‚Äù

# Reframing ‚ÄúBreadcrumbs‚Äù or Inconsistent Behavior

* **Identity 1 Behavior**: You cling to minimal attention (e.g., a like, a brief reply) and feel desperate for more, interpreting it as progress but still feeling unfulfilled.
* **Identity 2 Shift**:
   * **Practice**: Reinterpret their actions as signs of love, or let go of the need for external validation. Assume their small gestures are part of a bigger picture of commitment, even if it‚Äôs not fully visible yet.
   * **Example**: If the SP sends a short ‚ÄúHey‚Äù text, instead of thinking, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not interested,‚Äù respond warmly and assume, ‚ÄúThis is them reaching out because they love me.‚Äù Then, shift your focus to something fulfilling, like a hobby or self-care.
   * **Action**: When you notice yourself fixating on their behavior, repeat an affirmation like, ‚ÄúI am loved and cherished by \[SP‚Äôs name\], and our relationship is perfect.‚Äù Redirect your energy to activities that make you feel confident and whole.

# Self-Care and Personal Fulfillment

* **Identity 1 Behavior**: You neglect your own needs, prioritizing the SP‚Äôs attention. Your happiness depends on their actions, leaving you feeling drained or unworthy.
* **Identity 2 Shift**:
   * **Practice**: Act like someone who is already loved by prioritizing your well-being. Engage in activities that make you feel confident, attractive, and fulfilled, independent of the SP.
   * **Example**: Instead of waiting for the SP‚Äôs validation, spend time on self-care: take a relaxing bath, work out, or pursue a passion project. Dress in a way that makes you feel attractive, assuming the SP already sees you as their ideal partner.

# Handling Moments of Doubt

* **Identity 1 Behavior**: When doubt or anxiety arises (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat if they don‚Äôt love me?‚Äù), you spiral, reinforcing the assumption of rejection.
* **Identity 2 Shift**:
   * **Practice**: Catch doubts and flip them into affirmations of the desired reality. Use self-talk to remind yourself that the relationship is already yours.
   * **Example**: If you think, ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt texted in days, they don‚Äôt care,‚Äù immediately counter with, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre busy but love me deeply and will show it soon.‚Äù Then, visualize a loving interaction to shift your emotional state.



# Key Differences in Awareness

* **Identity 1** operates from a state of lack, where the SP is seen as separate or unattainable. Their actions (chasing, anxious texting) and emotions (insecurity, desperation) stem from the assumption that the relationship is out of reach, which perpetuates a reality of rejection or inconsistency.
* **Identity 2** operates from a state of fulfillment, where the relationship is already real in their mind. By embodying the feelings and behaviors of someone in a loving relationship, they align with a reality where the SP reciprocates their love naturally.",2,1757907648.0,mentaldietmastery,3,1.0,False

This might be long so I apologize...

Also all names are fake.

I (25 f) have always been a very trusting person, it's my biggest weakness sometimes. 

When I was in high school, I met a boy who we'll call ""Dick"", well Dick and I grew very close, so close that other kids at school were convinced that we were dating, which, it kinda felt like we were, he'd always sit next to me, and we'd hold hands. I'm a year younger than Dick so when I graduated, he was still in school.

I had a best friend who we're gonna call ""Lisa"", this girl was my ride or die, *was.* She texted Dick constantly asking when is he going to ask me out, until finally, he did, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes, we dated for about two years until...the breakup.

It was 2021 and my whole family had THE RONA! Or as my dad called it our ""Covid Family Vacation"" we were all really sick, and it was this time that this asshole decided to text me and break up with me! I was miserable enough and that made things so much worse! I swore that I would never talk to him again...I should have kept that promise.

So 2024 came and Dick got back in touch with me, we talked, and eventually he asked to meet up for coffee. He apologized and asked if we could still be friends, against my better judgement I said yes. We stayed friends and he hung out often, watching movies, playing fortnite, ect.I even invited him to mine and my sister's annual Halloween party, Old feelings were starting to return. New Years Eve comes and he texted me saying his family wasn't home and he was alone at home, I invited him to come to my house where we ate snacks shared a drink (I have Epilepsy and cannot drink too much), and just had a good time. Well, he ended up kissing me, we talked and decided to give it another try.

Before we got too serious I told him that I am bisexual (I officially came out in 2020), and he was fine with it and was supportive, even saying he would read my book that is an LGBTQ romance, once it was published. 

Seven months went by and they were incredible, I told him some very deep and personal stuff, and allowed myself to be vunerable. Big mistake.

One important thing before I carry on, Dick comes from an EXTREMELY religious family, his mom who we'll call ""Susan"", has always given me a vibe, and I had the deepest feeling that she never liked me. 

Anyhoo...DIck wouldn't answer any of my texts, which happened before but that was because he had problems with his phone, finally I got a text from him that simply said ""I love you"", I was not prepared for what happened next. 

I was in my bed reading when my mom and sister, we'll call my mom ""Jenna"" and my sister ""Megan"". Megan comes into my room with my mom and said they needed to talk to me, they guided me to the living room and my mom Jenna was already livid, I didn't understand why until they handed me an envelope with my name written on it, I recognized Dick's handwriting, because it sucks.

 I opened the envelope and there was a letter inside...a clearly AI written letter (AI WRITTEN!!)  saying that he loved our time together and everything like that but saying that he can't be with a bisexual person (despite showing a massive amount of support before). I broke down and my mom and Megan held me as I cried. My mom chewed him out calling him a liar and a coward and I sent him one last message where I told him how much he hurt me and that he's betrayed my trust, and this will be the last time I will ever acknowledge his existence (which has been a bit of a lie) and I also told him to have the life he deserves.

So obviously that day sucked, I had a stress induced seizure but my sister took me to get a drink from Starbucks which always makes me happy. 

The saying is true ""Fool Me Once, Shame On You. Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me.""

I feel like an idiot for giving him a second chance, but I feel like this is a lesson I had to learn on my own.

This includes inside the kitchen too I hate having to peek around corners when I‚Äôm at my prep station to see if I‚Äôm being stared at making sure I‚Äôm working. It actively disgusts me and creeps me out. I actively have routes to avoid him to enter the kitchen when I shouldn‚Äôt have to. He always does this walk by when I‚Äôm working when I know it‚Äôs just to check on me because he never actually does anything near my station and just circles around many times for no reason and that may seem not weird but I work in a secluded part away from people that nobody visits unless it‚Äôs for the bathroom corridor or the coffee machine next to me neither of which he does. I only feel at ease when he‚Äôs not present or in his office.

Another example would be I always have to be questioned if I know what I‚Äôm doing. Even if it‚Äôs day one stuff I already know. LIKE YES I KNOW WHAT FIRST IN FIRST OUT IS!!! It‚Äôs so insulting and sickening that I‚Äôm criticized and questioned over everything to make sure I‚Äôm doing the right thing even though I‚Äôve been at this job for a year and still have been there longer than him knew all the rules before he even stepped foot in this kitchen but that‚Äôs not good enough for him.

The worst part is the singling out. My coworker will be standing for a minute during the brief in between lunch periods when there‚Äôs no dishes cleaning or prep needed but if I stand I get punished or yelled at. My coworker doesn‚Äôt refill food at the end of the current lunch period when not needed no eyes batted. But I get scolded and told I don‚Äôt work if I do the same thing when I was bringing dishes in even though the second lunch was over and didn‚Äôt matter at the moment. My coworker didn‚Äôt do shit for a month but it was ‚Äúworkplace drama‚Äù I guess. I once got berated for getting water seconds after I was given a task for to clean when people were standing around doing absolutely nothing during early in the morning before breakfast and told I wasn‚Äôt pulling weight. This includes many other scenarios too much for this post. My coworkers even agree that I am singled out all the time over nothing.

I didn‚Äôt even get to the extremely worst part of being accused of drugs. In his words it was ‚Äúbad medication‚Äù because I stare too much or look lost all the time when I‚Äôm just autistic with adhd. I think this is the main reason he does all these things and is so hard on me because I‚Äôm so different from my coworkers. I don‚Äôt socialize I do my job and go home and I just get treated like I‚Äôm different from my coworkers I‚Äôm never taken seriously by him if I try to defend myself I get talked over or told I‚Äôm a bad worker. I should‚Äôve reported this but I have so much bad anxiety that I thought he would treat me worse if I did and it‚Äôs too late now.

I can‚Äôt even leave this job because I can‚Äôt afford bills without it even though I barely get paid enough as is until I find a more permanent full time position. My boss just makes it hell for me by treating me like an infant or constantly getting picked on for unnecessary things that other people don‚Äôt even get scolded for and I don‚Äôt know what to do. It also doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre understaffed. Luckily I got my degree and can find a better position for a job I want and leave this place behind without quitting.",3,1757907039.0,KitchenConfidential,4,0.8,False

1nhb9sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1nhb9sv/terrible_gpa_shitty_home_life_hoping_for_a_better/,Terrible GPA. Shitty home life. Hoping for a better future.,"Hi everyone,

I am writing this post to ask questions about the accounting industry in toronto.

I have multiple F NCR (no credit retained) and W (withdrawn) courses on my transcript‚Äîin total around 5. I have a CGPA of 2.3. Im a third year student.¬†

I am dealing with extreme narcissism and verbal abuse. It‚Äôs safe to say that I have a very unpredictable and unstable life. I cannot move out for personal reasons. The reason I mention this is because it has had a detrimental impact on my grades, confidence, social skills, and ability to be fully involved on campus. Money is scarce, so I try to go to events only on days I already have uni.

I have worked a short accounting role at a small and unknown local grocery store, and have had a few retail jobs. I am not very articulate or competent (I used to be). Now, I know I sound like the last person that anyone would want to hire, but the truth is I am actually very smart. Years ago I used to be an A-grade student , 4-year honor roll, great connections with teachers. But after COVID happened, everything fell apart. After some recent issues were resolved my grades improved. However, the resolution of that conflict has resulted in even more conflict‚Äîdare I say worse.

I am and have already attended networking events to better my soft skills (with slow improvement), and I might do a case competition if I have time.¬† I did one case comp (didn‚Äôt win). I am also going to improve my grades. Since I basically just transferred into accounting, I don‚Äôt actually have much accounting knowledge.

My goals are to have diverse streams of income. Be financially secure waking up and going to sleep. I don‚Äôt mind long hours in the first few years, but long term (4+ yrs) I value my time and peace.¬†

I have a lot of questions to ask. I know this is a lot, so please answer whatever/any questions you want to. Before you read these, just know that I‚Äôm aware I need therapy, but that‚Äôs not really an option right now. I would also like you to know that it‚Äôs hard for me to socialise after learning that the most peace I have is when I‚Äôm alone. These are all things I am curious about and want to know the answer to, organised by topic:

Resume:

* My resume consists of my short accounting job , a nearly 2-year period of customer experience at a retail store, and a case competition that I didn‚Äôt win. I formatted it ATS-compatible and similar to a resume that got someone into a Big 4.
   * Will anyone hire me with my GPA? Maybe a mid-tier firm? (I recently applied to a Big 4 and was so embarrassed to attach my transcript.)
   * With my experience, will networking alone help me land a position in the field even with my bad grades?
* Do you expect something mind-blowing in a cover letter?¬†



Networking:

* What do I talk about at networking events? I always get stumped. I‚Äôve been to around 4 in total and only had a good convo with one person‚Äîit was banter. I didn‚Äôt follow up on LinkedIn because of some problems I was dealing with.¬†
* Is it awkward to send a message on LinkedIn more than a week after meeting them?
* How do I network when I have unpredictable mindset shifts from things going on at home? Sometimes I‚Äôm enthusiastic, sometimes I‚Äôm nervous, sometimes I‚Äôm worried/anxious, sometimes I‚Äôm‚Äîliterally‚Äîdrop-dead scared.
   * This sounds weird, but sometimes when I try to network I feel like I don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù because of my bad grades. Like idk‚ÄîI feel like I‚Äôm lying to the person I‚Äôm talking to (I‚Äôm not telling them my grades, so I‚Äôm not even lying). But to act all relaxed and ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù when I‚Äôm literally crippling with Fs and Ds and Cs is so hard for me.
* Am I meant to talk about myself when I network? Is that a silly question? I feel like it‚Äôs too self-centered or sounds like I‚Äôm showing off. Can you please write a script of what you think a good introduction and convo sounds like with a recruiter/partner/worker?
* Do you have any resources on how to actually ‚Äúprofessionalize‚Äù myself?
* What are coffee chats? As a commuter this will be hard for me. Where do people do these? Why would someone I don‚Äôt know want to have coffee with me, especially after they hear of my grades?



Skills/Touch-Ups:

* What should I be focusing on other than my grades?
* What should my LinkedIn look like?
* Are the CFI Institute courses something that could help me? Would that make me stand out as a 3rd-year?¬†
* I don‚Äôt want to be more irrelevant or under-skilled than I already am. What are skills I should know? Excel, Power BI, AI? Do you have any widely accepted courses/certifications I can do online?



Accounting as a Career Pathway:

* I don‚Äôt view an accounting career as my only pathway. Is it more beneficial to get a CPA or CFA? Both? Does that sound crazy?
* Some cpas become professors, write textbooks, become recruiters. What are other things people go into‚Äîwhether or not they relate to accounting‚Äîthat earn them a lot of money? My goal here is to diversify income.



Random:

* If you are an awkward, non-social person like me‚Äîhow do you navigate office politics? I am genuinely scared of this.
* What are your regrets and non-regrets after working in accounting?
* What do you advise people to do to get the most of this career path?
* What advice from your own perspective do you believe I need?



I know I sound like a hopeless case, but I have changed a lot since I was‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ even more hopeless. And I truly believe in that change.",18,1757906964.0,Accounting,2,1.0,False

I am in my early 20s M and I never ever had Gf or even a female friend before. I see a lot of dating stuff on internet e.g., talk to a girl, ask her out and so and from my inner self I am not sure I does not get along with these things. I can‚Äôt make eye contact at first place but if convo is initiated I can chat, let it go well and even ask out for coffee or even number(I don‚Äôt get nervous in these kinda situations and let it go normal) 

From past few weeks I am getting feeling in me out of nowhere to find a girl and date. As during my college I was not that much attracted to girls as I am getting now. I am also getting sudden hike in my intimate desires(maybe cause puberty or something biology?) sometime I feel my brain is just fucked up and I am just dumb cause I don‚Äôt have what I want. There were situations where I felt that girls are into me and they were but my mind just like at exact sensitive movement be like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ignore them and not chat with them and tell them you are alpha male blah blah‚Äù and then regret after that I should not have missed the opportunity lol. I am just stupid. I have a lot of desires when I am alone about dating but when someone who I can date and talk to is near these desires just fades away and I am just blank or not able to showcase my feeling about them.

It‚Äôs really tough as not having female friends before ever, not know how they think, talk and communicate. I just feels FOMO that I will not be able to talk to someone, not befriend and so negative thoughts. I also created profile on dating apps and got 4-5 matches 2 months back but never got reply back from my text(maybe cause I just say ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù With not flirty seductive text lol). Also, Most of female I ever known, I never thought of them in any kinda sexual way and always respected them as best I can.

Overall, what I think is that I am lacking guidance that how I can improve myself in making connections with females and dos and donts when reaching out to a girl in person/online as stranger, to keep the flow going and so on. Any feedback, suggestions will be highly appreciated and thanks for it :)

1nhb7cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreaExperience/comments/1nhb7cx/locals_guide_how_to_enjoy_korean_caf√©s_like_a/,[Local's Guide] How to Enjoy Korean Caf√©s Like a Local in South Korea,"Hi everyone!  
If you‚Äôre visiting Korea, you‚Äôll notice something right away that this country is obsessed with coffee. On average, people here drink about 405 cups of coffee per person each year ‚Äî more than double the global average. That‚Äôs why there are still nearly 80,000 caf√©s nationwide, even after the first-ever drop in numbers last year. In Seoul, it sometimes feels like there‚Äôs a caf√© on every corner, from Starbucks to tiny dessert shops.

However, caf√©s in Korea aren‚Äôt just for coffee. They‚Äôre where locals study, work, meet friends, or even sit all day with a laptop. The caf√© culture here has its own unwritten rules that visitors might find surprising at first.

So if you want to enjoy caf√©s like a local, here are some everyday habits and etiquette tips you should know.

---

# Finding a Seat

* **Seat first, order later.** 
  * It might feel unusual if you‚Äôre from other countries, but it‚Äôs completely normal in South Korea to leave your bag, laptop, or even just a book to hold the table. 
  * Don‚Äôt worry too much ‚Äî theft is very rare, and most caf√©s have CCTV cameras everywhere. Because of this, locals naturally trust that their belongings will be safe while they order.
* **What if there are no seats?** 
  * Locals simply leave and go to another caf√©. With so many around, it‚Äôs no big deal.   
  * Tip: If you‚Äôre with a friend, one person can quickly check for seats while the other waits in line.

---

# Caf√© Rules Locals Expect

* **One drink per person.** 
  * This is the #1 rule many visitors miss. It‚Äôs an unspoken expectation that each person orders at least one drink. Some caf√©s even write it on the wall ‚Äú1Ïù∏ 1ÏùåÎ£å (one drink per person)‚Äù. 
  * If you don‚Äôt want coffee, ordering a dessert, cake, or Korean shaved ice dessert (bingsoo) is usually fine too. The point is that each person should order at least one item.
* **No outside food.** 
  * A common mistake for visitors ‚Äî locals would never bring snacks or drinks from outside.
* **Clean up & recycle.** 
  * Another thing international visitors often forget: leaving dishes on the table is considered rude. After finishing, locals always take trays and cups to the return station. Most caf√©s separate trash into cups, straws, sleeves, and food waste ‚Äî follow the signs.
* **Self-service items.** 
  * Water, napkins, straws, stirrers, or utensils are usually in a self-service corner.   * Look for a dispenser marked ‚ÄúÏÖÄÌîÑ.‚Äù Don‚Äôt expect staff to bring them automatically.
* **Menu quirks.**
  * You‚Äôll often see ‚ÄúAmericano‚Äù (ÏïÑÎ©îÎ¶¨Ïπ¥ÎÖ∏) as the default coffee ‚Äî basically espresso with hot water. It‚Äôs cheaper and less intense than lattes, and locals drink it year-round (yes, even iced in winter).  
  * There‚Äôs even a nickname for this habit: ‚ÄúÏñºÏ£ΩÏïÑ‚Äù (eol-juk-a), short for ‚ÄúÏñºÏñ¥ Ï£ΩÏñ¥ÎèÑ ÏïÑÎ©îÎ¶¨Ïπ¥ÎÖ∏‚Äù ‚Äî meaning ‚ÄúI‚Äôd drink iced Americano even if I freeze to death.‚Äù  
  * On the flip side, some people prefer hot drinks no matter what.  
    - ‚ÄúÎú®Ï£ΩÏïÑ‚Äù (tteu-juk-a)**,  short for ‚ÄúÎú®Í±∞Ïõå Ï£ΩÏñ¥ÎèÑ ÏïÑÎ©îÎ¶¨Ïπ¥ÎÖ∏‚Äù* ‚Äî meaning  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll still drink hot Americano, even if it‚Äôs scorching.‚Äù  
  * When ordering, you‚Äôll usually need to say whether you want it iced or hot. Many caf√©s also let you adjust: the amount of ice (less / regular / extra), adding extra espresso shots, or switching to decaf.
  * Prices change depending on these options ‚Äî an extra shot or decaf usually costs a little more.
* **Noise levels & study caf√©s.** 
  * Some caf√©s are social and lively, while others are as quiet as a library. Locals naturally lower their voices in quiet places without being told. 
  * For even more silence, many people use study caf√©s ‚Äî special venues designed only for studying. Most are unmanned (self-service) facilities, open 24/7 all year round, so there‚Äôs very little time restriction. The trade-off is that they‚Äôre extremely quiet zones ‚Äî no chatting, just focus. Don‚Äôt confuse them with regular caf√©s.
* **Stay as long as you want.** 
  * Long stays are normal. Nobody minds if you sit for hours studying, working, or chatting over one cup of coffee, while some caf√©s may set 3‚Äì4 hour limits.

---

# Ordering & Paying

* **At the counter with staff.** 
  * In big franchises like Starbucks, Twosome Place, or trendy dessert caf√©s, people usually order directly with staff.
* **At a kiosk (touchscreen machine).** 
  * Very common in cheaper coffee chains (like Mega Coffee, Compose Coffee) or even in fast food places like McDonald‚Äôs. Locals don‚Äôt find kiosks awkward ‚Äî it‚Äôs completely natural, and many actually prefer it for speed.
* **Through an app (mobile order).** 
  * Chains like Starbucks (Siren Order), Ediya, and others let you order and pay on your phone, then just pick up without waiting in line. Many locals do this daily.
* **No tipping.** 
  * Service is included, so tipping isn‚Äôt part of the culture.
* **Credit cards.** 
  * Most caf√©s accept credit cards, but some systems don‚Äôt work with foreign debit cards or American Express (Amex). 
  * It‚Äôs smart to carry some cash (KRW) as a backup.
* **Keeping your receipt or number slip.** 
  * No matter how you order, locals always keep their receipt or number slip until they pick up their drink ‚Äî it‚Äôs second nature, since most pickup systems depend on it.

---

# Picking Up Your Order - 4 Common Systems

* **Buzzer system** 
  * You get a vibrating pager. When it buzzes, pick up your order at the count
* **Number display system** 
  * Your order number appears on a digital screen. Check your receipt/number slip and pick up when it matches.
* **Call-out system** 
  * Staff call out your order ‚Äî sometimes just the drink name (‚ÄúIced Americano!‚Äù) or the receipt number. Listen for your drink.
* **Traditional dabang or teahouse style** 
  * In older-style caf√©s (common in small towns) or in Korean traditional teahouses, staff may bring drinks directly to your table instead of calling your number. 

üëâ Ask staff: **‚ÄúÌîΩÏóÖ Ïñ¥ÎîîÏóêÏÑú Ìï¥Ïöî?‚Äù (pik-eop eo-di-e-seo hae-yo?) ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhere do I pick up my order?‚Äù**

---

# Wi-Fi Tips & Power Outlets

* **Wi-Fi**
  * Almost every caf√© has free Wi-Fi, and the speed is impressively fast.
  * Passwords are often printed on receipts or posted on the wall. If not, just ask casually at the counter.
* **Power outlets.** 
  * Seats near power outlets are the most popular, since many people stay for hours. 
  * Some caf√©s have laptop-only zones, while others may restrict laptop use during busy times, so it‚Äôs a good idea to check the signs or ask staff.

üëâ  Ask staff: **‚ÄúÏΩòÏÑºÌä∏ Ïñ¥ÎîîÏóê ÏûàÏñ¥Ïöî?‚Äù (kon-sen-teu eo-di-e i-sseo-yo?) ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhere is the power outlet?‚Äù**  
* Staff may not understand the English words *‚Äúpower outlet‚Äù* or *‚Äúsocket.‚Äù*  
Instead, use the local word ‚ÄúÏΩòÏÑºÌä∏ (kon-seun-teu)‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs what Koreans call electrical outlets)  

---

# Smoking Rules

* **No smoking indoors.** By law, all caf√©s are smoke-free.
* **Smoking areas.** 
  * Bigger caf√©s may have terraces or outdoor zones with Ìù°Ïó∞Íµ¨Ïó≠ (smoking area) signs.
  * Smoking indoors is strictly prohibited, and violators may be fined 100,000 KRW (about 75 USD).

---

# Restroom Tips

* **Inside the caf√©.** 
  * Most big chains have separate men‚Äôs/women‚Äôs restrooms. But in small caf√©s, it may just be one unisex restroom. 
  * Don‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs only one for everyone.
* **Outside the caf√©.** 
  * In many multi-tenant buildings, restrooms are located outside the caf√©, and you may need a key or door code. 
  * Codes are often printed on your receipt or given by staff ‚Äî just ask if you‚Äôre unsure.

üëâ Ask staff: **‚ÄúÌôîÏû•Ïã§ Ïñ¥ÎîîÏòàÏöî?‚Äù (hwa-jang-sil eo-di-ye-yo?) ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhere is the restroom?‚Äù**

---

# Takeout & Reuse

* **Bring your own tumbler.** 
  * Many locals carry one, knowing they‚Äôll get a small discount.
- **Takeout cups indoors.**  
  If you order an iced drink, it will often come in a plastic cup even if you‚Äôre staying. For hot drinks, most caf√©s serve them in a **ceramic mug** when you drink inside.  

- **Switching to takeout.**  
  If you decide to leave before finishing, you can bring your mug to the counter and ask staff to transfer it into a takeout cup. This is very common and usually free of charge.  

üëâ Say: **‚ÄúÌÖåÏù¥ÌÅ¨ÏïÑÏõÉÏúºÎ°ú Î∞îÍøî Ï£ºÏÑ∏Ïöî.‚Äù (tei-keu-a-ut-eu-ro bak-kwo ju-se-yo?) ‚Üí ‚ÄúPlease change it to takeout.‚Äù**  

---

# Dessert Caf√© Culture

* **Dessert caf√©s are everywhere.** 
  * Locals love cake caf√©s, bingsoo spots, and bakeries.
* **Packing fees.** 
  * To-go desserts often require ‚Ç©500‚Äì‚Ç©1,000 extra for boxes, bags, or ice packs.
* **Sharing desserts.** 
  * Friends often order different items and share ‚Äî plates and forks are provided.
* **Seasonal specials & signature drinks.** 
  * Limited menus (like cherry blossom cakes in spring or sweet potato pies in fall) are very popular. 
  * Many caf√©s also have their own unique seasonal drinks or signature menus that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. 
  * It‚Äôs worth checking the posters or signs on the wall ‚Äî that‚Äôs usually where these specials are advertised.

---

# Pet-Friendly, Kids-Friendly, and Themed Caf√©s  
- **Pet-friendly caf√©s.** 
  * Dog caf√©s, cat caf√©s, or pet-friendly spaces are popular. Outside of these, most regular caf√©s do not allow pets ‚Äî the only exception is certified guide dogs for the visually impaired.  

- **Kids-friendly caf√©s** 
  * Some caf√©s are adults-only (‚ÄúNo kids‚Äù), while others are family-oriented kids caf√©s with play areas and child-friendly menus.  

- **Theme caf√©s.** 
  * From board game caf√©s to flower caf√©s, many spots offer unique experiences beyond coffee.  
  * There are also many other unique and special caf√©s across Korea ‚Äî I‚Äôll introduce those in another post when I get the chance!

Note: that the money is in the wallet and that useable naman siya virtually/online. Sa mga physical merchants lang talaga ako nagka-problem. Can‚Äôt remember the POS terminal type though.

Since then I never use it na. But just this week, I tried to use it because most of my CC‚Äôs have the highest international fees; and I heard Maya cards have the lowest international fees naman daw.

Yesterday, the TAP TO PAY function failed me again (BDO white POS terminal) but the INSERT TO PAY surprisingly worked. But it asked for my pin.

Ganun din ba sa Japan? 
Only insert to pay lang will work?

Here are some top use cases and pro tips.  Plus, 5 wild and fun use cases you don't need but you might want to try","**TLDR:**¬†Claude can now directly connect to your phone's apps including calendar, messaging, maps, and task managers. This means you can have Claude schedule meetings, draft messages, find locations, and organize your tasks without switching apps. Currently appears to be rolling out on mobile (iOS/Android). We're moving from ""Claude, what should I do?"" to ""Claude, please do it.""

Claude's App Integration is Here - Everything You Need to Know

Claude just dropped what might be the most practical AI update of 2025. Your AI assistant can now directly connect to and control your phone's native apps. No more copy-pasting between apps or manual data entry.

**What This Actually Means:**

Instead of Claude just giving you text responses, it can now:

* Directly add events to your calendar
* Send draft messages to your messaging apps
* Find locations and integrate with maps
* Create and manage task lists in your preferred app
* Access and organize your existing data across apps

You can do it for multiple things at once like this and it works perfectly  
Schedule a focus time block over the next work week that avoids conflicts with existing meetings. Show me some nearby coffee shops ‚Äì and remind me to take my headphones!

This set a meeting on my calendar, set a reminder for me, and told me the best nearby coffee shops perfectly. I just had to allow access to each of the apps the first time.

Top Use Cases That Will Change Your Workflow:

1. Meeting Scheduling on Steroids

* ""Check my calendar for next Tuesday and schedule a 30-minute call with John at any free slot after 2 PM""
* Claude checks availability, creates the event, and can even draft the invite message

**2. Intelligent Daily Planning**

* ""Look at my calendar for today and create a prioritized task list based on my meetings""
* ""Find a coffee shop near my 3 PM meeting location where I can work for an hour before""

**3. Context-Aware Communication**

* ""Draft a message to Mom about Sunday dinner, check my calendar for conflicts""
* ""Write a birthday message for Sarah and remind me to send it on her birthday""

**4. Travel Coordination**

* ""I have a dentist appointment at 2 PM on Main Street. Find parking nearby and add a reminder 30 minutes before with driving directions""

**5. Life Admin Automation**

* ""Every Friday, check my completed tasks for the week and draft a status update email""
* ""When I add a dinner reservation to my calendar, automatically add 'Book babysitter' to my task list""

How to Set It Up:

1. Update to the latest Claude mobile app
2. Go to Settings > App Connections
3. Grant permissions for the apps you want to integrate
4. You'll see available app actions when you start typing relevant requests

Pro Tips from Early Testing:

Be Specific with Permissions:¬†Only connect apps you actively want Claude to access. Start with calendar and tasks, then expand.

**Use Natural Language:**¬†""Add coffee with Jamie next Thursday at 3 PM at that place downtown we went last time"" actually works

**Chain Commands:**¬†""Check my calendar for tomorrow, find gaps longer than an hour, and suggest times I could go to the gym""

**Set Up Recurring Patterns:**¬†""Every Monday morning, look at my week and identify the three most important tasks""

**Review Before Executing:**¬†Claude shows you what it's about to do before making changes. Always review, especially for messages and calendar invites.

Current Limitations to Know:

* Cannot delete existing entries (only add/modify)
* Limited to certain app types (calendar, messages, maps, tasks currently)
* Requires explicit permission for each app
* Cannot access app-specific features (like Instagram stories or Spotify playlists)
* Message sending requires final user confirmation
* No access to banking or payment apps (by design, for security)

Privacy & Security Notes:

* All app connections are opt-in
* You can revoke access anytime
* Claude doesn't store your app data on their servers
* Each action requires confirmation before execution
* Audit log available for all actions taken

Availability:

From what I can determine, this appears to be rolling out to mobile users first. I'd recommend checking your app for updates. The exact tier availability (free vs. paid) isn't clear from the announcement, but historically Claude has made major features available to all users with some limitations for free accounts.

This isn't just another AI feature. It's the difference between an AI that gives advice and one that actually helps you implement it. We're moving from ""Claude, what should I do?"" to ""Claude, please do it.""

Im past 3mos since my 8yrs relationship ended. Ive been actively doing things to grow. I broke no contact last month but ultimately ended with rejection again. But i no longer plan to reach out now. Its just that days like this when im consumed again with rumination, i cant do things. Im bed rotting. But i just had fever few days ago. But still i find myself no longer have any will to proactively do things since the additional workload. I stopped going to the gym because of my Monday-Friday work, i have to wake up around 5am then be at work until 5pm. The travel time going home costs me a lot of hours too. I usually at home around evening at 7pm. Now im burn out and still have lingering heavy feelings from my failed relationship. My question is how important is it to prevent myself falling deeper into burnt out. I know that ive been healing before by discovering things and starting hobbies but since the addition of my work load, im having a hard time showing up for myself. Im excusing bed rot as rest day. But it only provides me more room for rumination. Ive asked chatgpt too if by not allocating my weekend properly, does it add up to my burn out and ruminations as well. I understand that hobbies such as gym teaches us discipline. Did i stop doing so by failing my routine? Will it fall to depression if i cant pull myself? Do i still need therapy? Im not having a hard time on my sleep and as well as eating. My appetite and sleep pattern are way better now than before. I had insomnia for aroun 3mos but i can now sleep better and early, i eat three time a day with snacks too. What else is wrong with me?

Think about how much time you spend every day moving your mouse, dragging it across the screen, and clicking tiny icons. Now imagine cutting that motion down to a fraction-where instead of clicking, you simply tap a couple of keys, and AI does exactly what you need. That‚Äôs the shift happening in 2025 with **keyboard-first AI UX**, and it‚Äôs rewriting the rules of productivity. In an era where workflows are stacked across apps, tabs, and prompts, minimizing friction is no longer a luxury-it‚Äôs survival.



**Author Insight:**[ Akash Mane](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/) is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows. He focuses on evidence-based reviews, clear benchmarks, and practical use cases that help creators and startups make smarter software choices. Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/), where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.



**What is keyboard-first UX and how does it change AI workflows?**

Keyboard-first UX means designing AI tools so that **everything important can be triggered by a keystroke**. Instead of navigating dropdowns, clicking buttons, or hunting for menus, you type a hotkey or command-and the action happens instantly.

For example:

* Pressing **Cmd+Shift+Space** to pull up an AI panel in Raycast.  
* Using **Ctrl+/ in Notion AI** to generate text, summaries, or action items without leaving your cursor.  
* Developers tapping **‚åòK** inside VS Code to summon AI for code fixes on the fly.  

This isn‚Äôt about replacing the mouse completely. It‚Äôs about building workflows where your brain doesn‚Äôt break its rhythm. Instead of pausing to navigate, you keep typing, prompting, creating.

The shift matters because **AI is embedded everywhere** now-in documents, design apps, browsers, research tools. The more seamless it feels, the more likely people are to use it daily. Keyboard-first design ensures AI becomes invisible infrastructure, not another app that interrupts flow.

**Hotkeys vs. mouse navigation: which is faster in real-world use?**

A Trustpilot survey of productivity software users (mid-2025) revealed that professionals who switched to keyboard-first AI tools reported saving an average of **20‚Äì25 minutes per day**. Why? Because every second of mouse movement adds up:

* Clicking through layers of menus to reformat text might take 7‚Äì10 seconds.  
* A hotkey command executes in less than 1 second.  
* Repeat that process 30 times a day, and you‚Äôve burned 5+ minutes just on formatting.  

Mouse navigation feels natural, but it‚Äôs slower because it requires **visual scanning, hand movement, and precision**. Hotkeys are faster because they compress all three steps into one reflex.

Real-world case: A copywriter using Jasper AI reported on G2 that replacing menu-driven prompt submissions with keyboard shortcuts cut their **content draft time by 30%**. That‚Äôs not a small tweak-it‚Äôs a structural change in how they work.

**Why professionals prefer minimal clicks for daily AI tasks**

Clicks aren‚Äôt just physical effort-they‚Äôre cognitive friction. Every extra click is a small decision point that pulls you out of flow. Professionals, especially those who rely on **AI for repetitive micro-tasks** (summarizing research, fixing grammar, generating design assets), don‚Äôt want interruptions.

Minimal-click workflows bring three big benefits:

1. **Speed:** Less time switching between input devices.  
2. **Consistency:** Hotkeys create muscle memory-your hands just know what to do.  
3. **Focus:** No breaking immersion to find buttons or commands.  

Think of it this way: when you‚Äôre in the middle of writing or coding, the last thing you want is to pause and reorient your eyes. Keyboard-first AI ensures the **tool adapts to your rhythm** instead of forcing you to adapt to the tool.

**Personal Experience:** When I first started testing AI writing assistants in 2022, I constantly clicked ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù buttons inside browser UIs. It felt fresh at the time, but my momentum always broke. Fast-forward to 2025, my setup looks completely different. I use Raycast with custom hotkeys, and my entire research-to-draft process happens in bursts of keystrokes. I don‚Äôt even think about it anymore-it‚Äôs muscle memory. The difference? What used to take me an hour, I now wrap up in 40 minutes. Those reclaimed 20 minutes every day add up to nearly **10 full working days a year** saved.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Deep Work* by Cal Newport (Chapter 3, p. 71), Newport explains how small interruptions compound into lost focus, making it harder to sustain deep concentration. Keyboard-first AI echoes this principle-by stripping away micro-distractions like mouse navigation, it protects the mental bandwidth needed for meaningful work.

# Mastering AI Hotkeys for Instant Actions

Hotkeys are no longer just shortcuts for copy-paste-they‚Äôve become the **command language of AI workflows in 2025**. The difference is striking: instead of typing long prompts or clicking through layers of menus, professionals now rely on a curated set of keystrokes to summon AI instantly. When AI is woven into tasks like drafting, debugging, or design edits, shaving off even two seconds per interaction creates exponential productivity gains.

**Best universal AI hotkeys every user should know**

Certain hotkeys have become universal across AI tools, creating a kind of **shared language for productivity**. Here are the most common ones in 2025:

* **Cmd+K / Ctrl+K** ‚Üí Universal ‚ÄúAI Command Bar.‚Äù Used in Raycast, Linear, and Figma plugins.  
* **Cmd+Shift+Space / Ctrl+Shift+Space** ‚Üí Trigger AI writing panels in Notion AI, Grammarly, and ClickUp.  
* **Cmd+Shift+/ / Ctrl+Shift+/** ‚Üí Quick-help hotkey that summons contextual AI assistance inside apps.  
* **Alt+Space** ‚Üí Menubar or dock-triggered AI assistants like Alfred or Warp AI.  

The idea is consistency: even if you switch between Mac, Windows, and Linux, the **muscle memory stays intact**. Platforms like Raycast have gone further, syncing hotkey preferences across devices using cloud profiles, so your shortcuts follow you no matter where you log in.

**How to customize shortcuts for personal workflows**

Every professional‚Äôs workflow looks different. A designer in Figma needs rapid access to ‚Äúgenerate icons,‚Äù while a researcher in Obsidian wants one-tap summaries of PDFs. That‚Äôs why customization has become essential.

* **Global vs. app-specific hotkeys:** Tools like Keyboard Maestro and AutoHotkey let you assign universal shortcuts that override defaults, while apps like VS Code or Notion allow per-app hotkey mapping.  
* **Workflow chaining:** Users now chain multiple AI tasks into a single shortcut. Example: pressing **Cmd+Shift+G** to both generate text and auto-format it into Markdown.  
* **Conflict resolution:** Platforms like Alfred 5 introduced ‚Äúhotkey conflict checkers,‚Äù which scan your setup to prevent overlaps with other productivity apps.  

Public reviews on G2 show that customized hotkeys increase adoption rates-users stick to AI tools longer when they align with personal muscle memory instead of forcing new behaviors.

**Hotkeys for multi-taskers: switching apps, prompts, and outputs in seconds**

For multi-taskers, hotkeys aren‚Äôt just about triggering AI-they‚Äôre about **navigating entire workflows without lifting hands off the keyboard**.

Examples from real users:

* A developer toggling between **terminal, documentation, and GitHub Copilot** with three hotkeys.  
* Writers switching between **Notion drafts, Google Docs, and AI research summaries** using Raycast‚Äôs quick-switch.  
* Marketers binding **Alt+Tab+AI trigger** to instantly paste generated ad copy into design mockups.  

In Capterra‚Äôs mid-2025 productivity report, 67% of users said multi-tasking hotkeys were their most-used AI feature. It‚Äôs not just about saving time-it‚Äôs about creating a **flow state where switching contexts feels invisible**.

**Personal Experience:** I used to keep three windows open for research-browser tabs, Notion, and an AI chat. It meant constant mouse clicks, copy-pastes, and tab-hopping. This year, I built a hotkey sequence on Raycast: **Cmd+Shift+R** triggers AI to summarize the current tab, **Cmd+Shift+N** sends it to Notion, and **Cmd+Shift+T** turns it into a task in Todoist. Suddenly, my workflow shrank from minutes to seconds. It feels like I‚Äôve outsourced the boring transitions and kept the focus on the actual work.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (Chapter 4, p. 75), Clear emphasizes the importance of reducing friction to make good habits stick. Hotkeys are the digital version of this-by removing micro-frictions in AI workflows, they make it easier for professionals to consistently rely on AI tools without breaking stride.

# Quick-Capture Features That Save Hours

If hotkeys are about speed, **quick-capture is about memory preservation**. In 2025, ideas move faster than ever-half of them disappear before they‚Äôre written down. Quick-capture features ensure you don‚Äôt lose sparks of insight in the shuffle of meetings, emails, or late-night brainstorms. Think of it as your second brain‚Äôs inbox: you hit a key, jot a thought, and it‚Äôs safely stored and AI-ready.

**What quick-capture means in modern AI design**

Quick-capture isn‚Äôt just note-taking-it‚Äôs **context-aware capture**. AI tools designed with this principle automatically tag, organize, and prep your snippets for action.

For example:

* **Notion AI Quick Capture:** Pressing a hotkey lets you dump raw thoughts, then AI cleans and categorizes them into your workspace.  
* **Readwise Reader + AI:** While skimming research, highlight text and it‚Äôs auto-summarized into a knowledge base.  
* **Craft AI‚Äôs Capture Panel:** Lets you save mid-sentence ideas without breaking your writing flow.  

Unlike traditional sticky notes, these captured items are **instantly searchable, synced, and actionable**. AI can even nudge you: ‚ÄúYou captured this yesterday-want me to expand it into a draft?‚Äù

**Capturing thoughts and prompts before they slip away**

We‚Äôve all been there-you think of the perfect phrasing for a client email or the outline of a blog post, but by the time you reach the right app, it‚Äôs gone. Quick-capture solves that with **one-step logging**.

* Writers: Hit **Ctrl+Space**, type a sentence, and AI turns it into a polished draft later.  
* Coders: Use a menubar quick-capture to paste snippets or error logs mid-debugging.  
* Researchers: Highlight a PDF passage and have it instantly summarized into your notes.  

The beauty here is psychological: once you know you won‚Äôt lose ideas, your mind relaxes. You‚Äôre less anxious about ‚Äúholding on‚Äù to thoughts and more free to create.

**Tools with quick-capture panels for writers, coders, and researchers**

Several tools are dominating this space:

* **Notion AI Quick Capture:** Best for writers juggling ideas, prompts, and snippets.  
* **Obsidian + QuickAdd plugin:** Loved by researchers for lightning-fast capture into knowledge graphs.  
* **Raycast AI Panel:** Popular with developers-it supports capturing commands, error logs, and code snippets.  
* **Mem AI:** Designed like a memory-first workspace; its capture panel auto-contextualizes every input.  

On Product Hunt, Mem AI‚Äôs community feedback highlights this exact strength: ‚ÄúI can throw raw thoughts in during meetings, and later it feels like my notes wrote themselves.‚Äù

**Personal Experience:** I used to keep sticky notes around my desk and type ideas into random draft docs. The chaos meant I lost half of my sparks. Once I switched to quick-capture in Notion AI, my workflow shifted. During a client call, I hit a hotkey, jot notes in 10 seconds, and AI organizes them under the project‚Äôs workspace. I don‚Äôt even clean them up-AI does it for me. That single change saved me hours of reorganization every week.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Getting Things Done* by David Allen (Chapter 2, p. 35), Allen argues that your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. Quick-capture embodies this principle: it frees mental energy by moving thoughts instantly into an external, AI-powered system.

# The Rise of Menubar AI Tools on Desktop

If quick-capture gave AI a pocket-sized home, **menubar tools gave it a permanent address**. By 2025, AI apps have climbed out of standalone windows and into the top strip of your screen-the menubar. That tiny space, often ignored for years, has become prime real estate for productivity. Why? Because it‚Äôs **always there**, one click or hotkey away, without cluttering your desktop.

**Why menubar AI apps are dominating in 2025**

The shift toward menubar AI apps isn‚Äôt accidental-it‚Äôs a direct response to how people work today. Instead of opening heavy apps or browser tabs, users want **lightweight, persistent, and instant AI access**.

* **Zero-launch friction:** Menubar tools skip the app-launch step. Tap a hotkey, and AI is ready.  
* **Contextual assistance:** They live above all your active apps, making it easier to drop text, code, or screenshots into AI.  
* **Battery of integrations:** Tools like Raycast AI, TypingMind, and Alfred AI link directly with Google Docs, Slack, VS Code, and more.  

According to Capterra‚Äôs 2025 UX trends report, 73% of professionals using AI daily prefer menubar apps over browser tabs, citing ‚Äúspeed‚Äù and ‚Äúreduced context-switching‚Äù as their top reasons.

**Comparing menubar vs. standalone AI apps**

Let‚Äôs break down the key differences between these two approaches:

**Menubar AI Apps:**

* Always visible and accessible.  
* Light on resources; often cloud-synced.  
* Designed for micro-tasks like summarizing, generating quick text, or capturing notes.  

**Standalone AI Apps:**

* Better for deep, focused work (e.g., longform writing in Jasper or coding in Cursor).  
* Usually heavier, requiring manual launch and window management.  
* More robust but slower for quick, repeated tasks.  

The verdict? Most professionals end up using both. Menubar apps handle **fast, repeatable tasks**, while standalone apps handle **deep, project-based workflows**.

**The top menubar tools for Mac and Windows power users**

Some standout menubar AI tools as of mid-2025:

* **Raycast AI (Mac):** The powerhouse of menubar AI, offering global search, quick-capture, AI commands, and integration with dev workflows.  
* **TypingMind Desktop:** Known for its slick UI and ability to run multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) right from the menubar.  
* **Alfred AI (Mac):** A productivity veteran turned AI-first; excels at chaining workflows.  
* **Cortado AI (Windows):** Lightweight assistant that integrates directly with Microsoft Office and Teams, designed for enterprise users.  
* **MenubarX + AI (Cross-platform):** Hybrid app letting users embed any AI web app into the menubar.  

On Trustpilot, Raycast AI scores highly for ‚Äúspeed‚Äù and ‚Äúminimal design,‚Äù while Cortado is praised by enterprise users for its ‚Äúno-friction Microsoft stack integration.‚Äù

**Personal Experience:** Switching to menubar AI completely reshaped my desktop flow. Before, I‚Äôd keep ChatGPT or Claude open in a browser tab, constantly alt-tabbing to copy-paste. Now, Raycast AI lives in my menubar. If I need a code snippet, summary, or brainstorm, it‚Äôs there in two keystrokes. No extra windows. No distractions. I didn‚Äôt realize how much tab-hopping slowed me until I cut it out.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman (Chapter 5, p. 138), Norman explains the concept of ‚Äúvisibility of system status‚Äù-good tools make themselves available at the exact point of need. Menubar AI embodies this perfectly, staying visible but unobtrusive, always ready without demanding attention.

# AI Workflows Optimized for Hotkeys and Menus

Once hotkeys and menubar tools merge, they stop being just ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù and start shaping entire workflows. In 2025, AI isn‚Äôt something you go to-it comes to you, embedded inside the flow of your work. Whether you‚Äôre coding, designing, or digging through research papers, **keyboard-first AI paired with menubar access creates a seamless rhythm** that feels closer to instinct than software.

**How hotkeys streamline coding and debugging**

Developers have been the biggest winners of hotkey-driven AI. Debugging, once a tab-heavy and context-switching nightmare, has collapsed into instant keystroke flows.

* **Inline fixes:** In VS Code, pressing Cmd+Shift+. highlights an error and auto-suggests an AI fix without leaving the editor.  
* **Refactoring:** Ctrl+Alt+R pulls up an AI-assisted refactor suggestion panel.  
* **Docs on demand:** A simple Cmd+K fetches relevant documentation or Stack Overflow answers via menubar integration.  

On GitHub discussions, developers report that these workflows reduce debugging loops by up to **40%**, because AI steps in at the exact keystroke of frustration. It‚Äôs not just faster-it‚Äôs less emotionally draining.

**Design workflows: instant AI help in Figma, Photoshop, or Sketch**

Designers live in tools where **flow state is visual and tactile**. Constantly jumping to another app to ask AI breaks that rhythm. Hotkey + menubar integrations solved this pain point.

* In **Figma**, hitting Cmd+/AI generates icon variations on the spot.  
* In **Photoshop**, plugins allow Ctrl+Shift+G to expand backgrounds or remove elements without opening a separate panel.  
* **Sketch AI Assistant** can be triggered with Alt+Space, giving real-time copy suggestions for UI components.  

Product Hunt reviews for Figma AI plugins show a recurring theme: ‚ÄúI save my best ideas because I don‚Äôt have to break flow to fetch AI help.‚Äù

**Research workflows: one-tap summaries and citations from menubar**

Researchers and students arguably get the most tangible benefit. Menubar AI tools act like **permanent research assistants** sitting on your desktop.

* Highlight text in a PDF, press Cmd+Shift+S, and get an AI-generated summary in seconds.  
* Use Alt+C to create instant citations in APA/MLA style.  
* Capture a quote into Obsidian or Notion without copy-paste fatigue.  

According to a mid-2025 survey on Capterra, 62% of academic users said they trust AI research assistants more when they‚Äôre embedded directly into their workflow, as opposed to ‚Äúseparate chat windows.‚Äù The reason? Context integration reduces mistakes.

**Personal Experience:** I used to hate debugging-it always broke my patience. Switching between terminal logs, Google, and docs felt like fighting the tools, not the bug. The first time I used a hotkey to trigger AI-assisted debugging inside VS Code, it felt like cheating. Now, even design tasks follow the same pattern: in Photoshop, one shortcut expands an image background seamlessly. The real win isn‚Äôt just speed-it‚Äôs the confidence that AI will always meet me where I am.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Chapter 2, p. 42), the author describes how flow emerges when challenges and skills align without interruptions. Keyboard-first AI embodies this: it lowers the barrier between intention and execution, letting you stay in deep work without hitting productivity speed bumps.

# Popular AI Apps That Nail Keyboard-First Design

By 2025, only a handful of AI tools have truly **mastered the art of keyboard-first UX**. These apps don‚Äôt just tack on shortcuts-they‚Äôre built from the ground up for people who want to think, type, and execute without distraction. They blur the line between ‚Äúassistant‚Äù and ‚Äúreflex,‚Äù turning AI into something you summon without breaking your stride.

**Notion AI and its quick-capture edge**

Notion AI is often praised for its **all-in-one workspace**, but its quick-capture and hotkey integration have pushed it to the front of keyboard-first adoption.

* **Quick-capture panel:** Cmd+Shift+Space drops you into an AI note-capture screen that syncs instantly with workspaces.  
* **Inline commands:** Typing /ai pulls up prompt suggestions, from summarization to task creation.  
* **Meeting workflows:** With hotkeys, you can capture raw notes mid-call, then transform them into cleaned-up minutes in seconds.  

On G2, reviewers highlight this exact advantage: ‚ÄúNotion AI doesn‚Äôt just take notes-it turns chaos into structured action without me leaving my keyboard.‚Äù

**Raycast vs. Alfred: keyboard-driven AI on macOS**

Mac users in particular have embraced **Raycast and Alfred AI**\-two powerhouses competing for the same audience of shortcut-obsessed professionals.

* **Raycast AI:** Minimal, developer-friendly, cloud-synced hotkeys, and menubar dominance. Integrates natively with GitHub, Jira, and Figma.  
* **Alfred AI:** A productivity veteran upgraded with AI capabilities. Known for deep custom workflows and chaining multiple tasks into a single shortcut.  

The debate on Reddit communities is fierce. Raycast fans love its clean interface and app integrations, while Alfred loyalists argue it offers **deeper workflow scripting**. Both tools are part of the daily stack for keyboard-first pros.

**Best AI tools for terminal-first developers**

Developers who live inside terminals also benefit from keyboard-first AI tools:

* **Warp AI:** Built into the terminal, offering inline completions, error explanations, and command suggestions.  
* **Fig + AI:** Adds smart autocomplete with AI explanations directly into shell commands.  
* **Zed Editor:** A lightweight IDE with built-in hotkey-first AI support for collaboration.  

On GitHub repositories, Warp AI‚Äôs commits show rapid iteration on **keyboard-native features**, proving that open-source communities are pushing the terminal-first AI movement forward.

**Personal Experience:** When I first tried Raycast AI, I felt like I had installed a command line for my entire desktop. Everything-search, snippets, AI prompts-was a hotkey away. Later, I experimented with Alfred‚Äôs workflows, and I realized the choice isn‚Äôt about which is ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù but which matches your rhythm. As a writer, Notion AI became my quick-capture hub. As a developer, Warp AI is my lifeline. It feels like each tool occupies its own corner of my workday.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Pragmatic Programmer* by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas (Chapter 6, p. 115), the authors emphasize the importance of mastering tools so they ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù into the background. That‚Äôs exactly what these keyboard-first AI apps achieve-they fade away until all that remains is your flow and the work itself.

# Customizing Hotkeys for Multi-Platform Efficiency

By 2025, one of the biggest frustrations in productivity isn‚Äôt just tool overload-it‚Äôs **hotkey inconsistency across platforms**. The shortcut you swear by on macOS doesn‚Äôt always exist on Windows, and Linux adds its own quirks. That‚Äôs why customizing hotkeys for **multi-platform efficiency** has become an essential part of mastering AI-driven workflows. Professionals don‚Äôt just use AI in one app-they expect seamless movement across their laptops, desktops, and even mobile keyboards.

**Cross-platform hotkey consistency: Mac, Windows, Linux**

Cross-platform consistency isn‚Äôt just convenience-it‚Äôs **muscle memory protection**. If your workflow hotkeys are mapped differently across systems, your speed crashes.

* **Mac:** Default AI hotkeys often lean on Cmd+Shift combos (e.g., Cmd+Shift+Space).  
* **Windows:** Uses Ctrl+Alt combos due to OS-level conflicts with Ctrl+Shift.  
* **Linux:** Offers the most flexibility, but different distros (Ubuntu vs. Arch) still lead to fragmentation.  

Tools like **Raycast (Mac)**, **Cortado (Windows)**, and **Warp AI (Linux)** now offer **cloud-synced hotkey profiles**, so when you switch machines, your shortcuts follow. According to Capterra reviews, users rate cross-platform syncing as one of the top three features keeping them loyal to a specific AI tool.

**How to set global vs. app-specific shortcuts**

Not all hotkeys should behave the same everywhere. Some need to be **global**, others app-specific.

* **Global hotkeys:** Always work regardless of the app. Example: Alt+Space to open a menubar AI assistant from anywhere.  
* **App-specific hotkeys:** Only trigger when inside certain apps. Example: Cmd+Shift+. to auto-generate summaries in Notion AI but stay inactive in Figma.  

Power users rely on **Keyboard Maestro (Mac)** or **AutoHotkey (Windows)** to handle these layers. AI-first platforms are catching up too: Raycast and Alfred both now include **context-aware hotkey rules**.

**Avoiding shortcut conflicts with other productivity apps**

One overlooked pain point: shortcut conflicts. If your AI app hotkey collides with a system-level or other productivity app shortcut, you‚Äôll end up frustrated fast.

Examples of common conflicts:

* **Ctrl+Shift+S**: Often mapped to ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù in design apps, but also used by AI assistants for summaries.  
* **Cmd+K**: Universal ‚Äúinsert link‚Äù in editors, but AI apps sometimes claim it for command search.  

Modern AI tools now come with **conflict checkers** that scan your system to recommend safer mappings. BuiltWith reports show increasing adoption of apps that **auto-resolve hotkey overlaps**, a clear sign that smooth UX is becoming a competitive differentiator.

**Personal Experience:** When I first tested Cortado AI on Windows alongside Figma and Photoshop, I constantly triggered the wrong commands because of overlapping hotkeys. It was maddening-I‚Äôd try to generate a summary but end up saving a file instead. Eventually, I standardized my setup with AutoHotkey, ensuring global shortcuts stayed clean while app-specific ones never clashed. Now my hands know exactly what to press, no matter the device.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Tim Ferriss (Chapter 5, p. 112), Ferriss stresses the power of systematizing workflows to reclaim time. Custom hotkeys are a digital version of this principle: by systematizing AI access across platforms, you strip out wasted moments and protect focus where it matters most.

# Quick-Capture for Teams and Collaboration

Quick-capture isn‚Äôt just a solo feature anymore-in 2025, it has become a **teamwide advantage**. When groups work across different time zones, apps, and projects, the ability to instantly log and share thoughts means fewer ideas fall through the cracks. Instead of waiting for the ‚Äúmeeting recap email‚Äù or manually compiling brainstorm notes, teams now rely on **shared quick-capture streams** powered by AI.

**How quick-capture tools improve meeting workflows**

Meetings are notorious for information overload. Quick-capture tools are changing that by turning **chaotic conversations into structured outputs**.

* **AI note capture:** During Zoom or Google Meet, hotkeys trigger AI that captures spoken content in real time.  
* **Auto-structuring:** Captured snippets are sorted into decisions, tasks, and reference notes without manual editing.  
* **Team sync:** Everyone in the call sees the same AI-powered notes synced into project tools like Asana or Notion.  

On G2, users of tl;dv and Fireflies AI note that integrated capture features **cut follow-up work by half**\-teams no longer spend hours reconstructing what was said.

**Real-time capturing of ideas during brainstorming**

Brainstorms often produce gold in fleeting moments. Without capture, those ideas vanish. In 2025, collaborative AI tools provide **real-time capture panels** that update across everyone‚Äôs screen.

* A designer drops a visual idea, captured and tagged by AI as ‚ÄúUI concept.‚Äù  
* A marketer suggests a headline, instantly stored as ‚Äúcampaign copy option.‚Äù  
* An engineer highlights a constraint, logged as ‚Äútechnical blocker.‚Äù  

Because the capture is shared, the entire team benefits. No one needs to be the ‚Äúnote-taker,‚Äù and no one feels left out of the conversation later.

**Turning captured snippets into tasks in project management AI**

The true magic happens when captured snippets don‚Äôt just sit there-they **become actionable tasks**.

* Meeting highlights become Jira tickets.  
* Brainstorm lines become Trello cards.  
* Research notes turn into Notion task lists with AI-suggested deadlines.  

In PitchBook‚Äôs analysis of AI-enabled productivity startups (2025), investors point to this ‚Äúcapture-to-action pipeline‚Äù as the biggest growth driver. Tools that can instantly turn thoughts into structured tasks are raising more funding than those that stop at note-taking.

**Personal Experience:** During a product sprint, our team used to spend hours debating, then another two hours syncing notes into Asana. Since shifting to Fireflies AI with quick-capture integrations, tasks now generate automatically during the call. I press a hotkey, the AI logs my point, and by the time the meeting ends, action items are already assigned. It cut our sprint wrap-up time by nearly 70%.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Team of Teams* by General Stanley McChrystal (Chapter 7, p. 152), McChrystal emphasizes how shared consciousness creates stronger execution. Quick-capture for teams is a digital embodiment of this-by ensuring everyone has access to the same captured insights, alignment becomes automatic instead of forced.

# Menubar Tools for Mobile and Hybrid Workflows

Menubar AI tools started as a desktop-first innovation, but by mid-2025, they‚Äôve expanded to mobile and hybrid devices. The reason is simple: **work doesn‚Äôt live on one screen anymore**. Whether it‚Äôs an iPad in a coffee shop, a Chromebook in class, or a foldable phone during travel, professionals need AI tools that live in the same ‚Äúalways-there‚Äù space as on desktops.

**Can menubar UX work on iPads, foldables, or Chromebooks?**

The short answer: yes, but it looks different. Mobile and hybrid devices don‚Äôt have a traditional ‚Äúmenubar,‚Äù so developers have adapted:

* **iPadOS & iOS:** Menubar AI appears as **floating edge-panels**, triggered by swipe + hotkey combos using external keyboards.  
* **Foldables (Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, Pixel Fold):** AI tools slot into **edge toolbars** that expand contextually when the device is unfolded.  
* **Chromebooks:** Menubar AI lives in the system tray, syncing shortcuts with Android apps for unified UX.  

On Product Hunt, TypingMind Mobile has become a hit by offering a cross-device menubar-style floating assistant that mirrors its desktop behavior.

**How hybrid workers use menubar AI while on the move**

Hybrid workers juggle environments-home office, coworking space, and travel. Menubar AI tools make that switching seamless:

* **Writers:** Use quick-capture on iPad with a keyboard, syncing notes into Notion AI.  
* **Developers:** Run menubar-style assistants on Chromebooks that tie directly into GitHub commits.  
* **Consultants:** Trigger one-swipe summaries of PDFs on foldables mid-flight.  

A Trustpilot review of Raycast‚Äôs mobile sync notes: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even care what device I‚Äôm on anymore-my shortcuts and captures follow me everywhere.‚Äù That‚Äôs the point: familiarity across contexts.

**The future of portable menubar AI design**

The next frontier is **context awareness across devices**. Imagine this flow:

* Capture a thought on your iPhone menubar widget during commute.  
* Expand it into a draft on your iPad.  
* Polish and ship it on your Mac or Windows desktop.  

Companies like Raycast, Mem AI, and Cortado are actively testing **portable menubar design** where AI lives across every surface you work on. BuiltWith reports show that mobile-friendly menubar UX is now the **most requested feature** in AI productivity forums.

**Personal Experience:** While traveling, I used to rely on separate mobile apps for note-taking, task capture, and AI chat. Switching between them was clunky. This year, I tried TypingMind‚Äôs floating menubar on my iPad-it felt like carrying my desktop assistant in my backpack. I‚Äôd jot down thoughts on a train, then expand them into articles at my desk. That portability gave me continuity I didn‚Äôt realize I was missing.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Extended Mind* by Annie Murphy Paul (Chapter 5, p. 189), Paul explains how tools outside our brains expand cognition when they‚Äôre available ‚Äúat the point of need.‚Äù Portable menubar AI reflects this principle-it extends your mental workspace across every device you touch, ensuring no idea is lost in transition.

# UX Design Principles Behind Keyboard-First AI

Behind every great hotkey or menubar tool is **intentional UX design**. Keyboard-first AI isn‚Äôt just about saving seconds-it‚Äôs about crafting experiences that reduce friction, protect focus, and make complex tasks feel natural. In 2025, the best AI tools share a design philosophy: they prioritize flow, accessibility, and cognitive ease.

**Cognitive load reduction: why fewer clicks matter**

Cognitive load theory tells us that our brains have limited working memory. Every extra click, window switch, or modal adds to that burden. Keyboard-first AI reduces this load by **removing micro-decisions**.

* Instead of asking, *‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that menu option?‚Äù* you type a hotkey you already know.  
* Instead of navigating multiple steps, one keystroke gets you the result.  

Research from Nielsen Norman Group in 2025 shows that **keyboard-first interfaces reduce task completion times by 27%** on average, because users don‚Äôt waste mental energy on navigation.

**Accessibility benefits of hotkey-driven AI**

Accessibility is often overlooked in AI design-but hotkey-driven UX provides massive benefits:

* **For users with motor impairments:** Hotkeys reduce the strain of precise mouse movements.  
* **For neurodiverse users:** Predictable shortcuts build muscle memory, reducing overwhelm.  
* **For visually impaired users:** Screen readers integrate more smoothly with keystroke commands than with cluttered UI menus.  

Capterra‚Äôs accessibility reviews highlight Raycast and Warp AI as leaders in this space, praised for inclusive hotkey mapping that adapts to diverse user needs.

**Designing AI interfaces with flow state in mind**

The most effective AI tools don‚Äôt just work-they disappear. Designers are now building **flow-friendly UX** that keeps users immersed:

* **Persistent menubar access:** AI remains in sight but not distracting.  
* **Non-blocking prompts:** Hotkey panels appear inline, not as full-window takeovers.  
* **Custom rhythm:** Tools allow users to set their own cadence, like adjusting how quickly AI suggestions appear.  

As MIT Technology Review noted in their 2025 UX spotlight, ‚ÄúThe real test of AI design is whether you forget the tool exists.‚Äù Keyboard-first AI passes this test by weaving itself into the natural rhythm of work.

**Personal Experience:** I‚Äôve noticed that when I rely on mouse-heavy AI apps, I never quite hit deep concentration. It‚Äôs like driving with speed bumps every 20 meters. But when I work with keyboard-first AI-hotkeys in Raycast, inline commands in Notion-I forget about the tool itself. Hours pass, and I‚Äôve stayed in pure flow. That shift isn‚Äôt just productivity-it feels healthier, less mentally draining.

**Famous Book Insight:** In *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (Part II, p. 99), Kahneman explains how reducing ‚ÄúSystem 2 effort‚Äù (deliberate thinking) creates smoother experiences. Keyboard-first AI embodies this by lowering effortful navigation, letting users rely on fast, intuitive actions instead of constant conscious decisions.

  


# FAQ

The rise of keyboard-first AI has sparked a flood of practical questions from users trying to optimize their daily setup. Below are some of the most common queries people ask on forums, Reddit threads, and Q&A sites, with clear, grounded answers.

# What are the best free keyboard-first AI tools?

Several tools offer free tiers with excellent keyboard-first UX as of mid-2025:

* **Raycast AI (Mac):** Free core features, hotkey panels, and lightweight AI assistant.  
* **Obsidian with QuickAdd + AI plugins:** Perfect for researchers and writers who want fast capture and summarization.  
* **Alfred AI (Mac):** Free version with customizable workflows, extended in Pro.  
* **Cortado AI (Windows):** Free entry tier, integrates directly with Microsoft Teams and Office.  
* **Mem AI:** Free plan for personal quick-capture and AI organization.  

Each of these tools lets you experiment with hotkey-first workflows before committing to paid plans. G2 reviews often highlight that the **free tiers are enough for solo professionals** to start.



# How do I set up AI hotkeys on Windows vs. Mac?

The process differs slightly by platform:

* **MacOS:** Most AI tools use Cmd modifiers. Apps like Raycast and Alfred allow system-wide shortcut mapping directly in preferences. For deeper customization, **Keyboard Maestro** is the go-to tool.  
* **Windows:** AI apps like Cortado and TypingMind let you set hotkeys via app settings. For universal control, **AutoHotkey** scripts allow you to create global or context-specific shortcuts.  
* **Cross-platform:** Cloud-syncing has improved dramatically. Many tools now allow exporting/importing hotkey profiles, so your setup can travel with you between devices.  

BuiltWith analysis shows that more AI apps are embedding **native hotkey mapping tools** to avoid forcing users into third-party setups.



# Are menubar AI apps secure for sensitive data?

This is a top concern-especially for enterprise users handling confidential work. The good news: most leading menubar AI tools in 2025 prioritize **end-to-end encryption and local processing where possible**.

* **Raycast AI:** Processes snippets locally before sending requests to external models.  
* **Cortado AI (enterprise tier):** Offers on-premise deployment for regulated industries.  
* **TypingMind:** Lets you bring your own API keys, meaning you control the data pipeline.  

Trustpilot and Capterra reviews consistently mention **transparency and security disclosures** as a key decision factor when adopting menubar AI apps. While no tool is perfectly risk-free, opting for apps with **SOC 2 or ISO 27001 compliance** is now standard advice.



**Personal Experience:** When I first tried menubar AI tools, I hesitated to feed sensitive client text into them. Later, I moved to TypingMind, which let me use my own OpenAI API key-suddenly, I felt more in control. Today, I pair it with Raycast AI for quick tasks and Cortado for enterprise-level workflows. Balancing convenience with trust became easier once I understood the security options available.



**Famous Book Insight:** In *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford (Chapter 9, p. 182), the authors highlight how trust in systems determines whether teams adopt them fully. Menubar AI apps mirror this lesson: without visible security and reliability, adoption stalls-no matter how slick the UX.",1,1757906278.0,AiReviewInsider,0,1.0,False

Corporate Tax in Bahrain: The Reality in 2025\
The Core: Zero Standard Corporate Tax Rate\
The key advantage? Bahrain imposes 0% corporate income tax on most activities, regardless of shareholding structure or nationality. There‚Äôs only one narrow exception: companies engaged in oil, gas, or hydrocarbon extraction and refining, which face a fixed 46% tax.\
\
If your business is outside the energy sector, your effective headline tax is zero.\

VAT and Withholding\
Bahrain applies a 10% Value Added Tax (VAT) on most goods and services, but there‚Äôs no personal income tax and no standard withholding tax on dividends or interest. Some clients confuse VAT registration with corporate tax‚Äîdon‚Äôt! (I‚Äôve seen founders delay VAT registration, thinking it‚Äôs ‚Äúoptional,‚Äù only to receive BHD 500+ late penalties.)\
For post-setup compliance, see Keylink: Accounting & Bookkeeping Services in Bahrain.\
Why Bahrain‚Äôs Tax System Attracts Global Entrepreneurs\
Unlike the UAE (which launched 9% federal corporate tax in 2023) or Saudi Arabia (20% corporate income tax for foreign-owned businesses), Bahrain‚Äôs model is designed to attract FDI, minimize friction, and keep compliance simple.\
\
No corporate tax for most sectors\
No currency restrictions\
100% foreign ownership allowed (with nearly all business activities covered ‚Äî see Keylink: 100% Foreign Ownership in Bahrain)\
Quick licensing (as fast as 4 days for basic CR in Manama)\
\
These are not just technical advantages‚Äîthey shape the way people do business here. The result? More time for networking, strategy, and market growth; less time bogged down in red tape.\
And, crucially, Bahrain‚Äôs business community understands the value of personal relationships‚Äîmajlis gatherings and Ramadan adjusted hours are not just customs, but powerful platforms for partnership and market entry.\
Real Cost Considerations for Company Formation in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation. fees: BHD 50‚Äì100 initial, plus annual renewal BHD 100‚Äì300, depending on business type\
* Office space: Virtual office addresses from BHD 150/year (Seef, Diplomatic Area). Physical shared offices start BHD 500‚Äì1,200/month\
* MOICT licensing: Sector-specific, often BHD 200‚Äì500\
* Professional services (lawyer, formation agent): BHD 800‚Äì2,500 full package\
* LMRA visa deposit: BHD 200‚Äì400 per visa (employee or investor)\
* Sijilat (online portal) fees**: negligible, but timely filing prevents late fees (BHD 50‚Äì100 penalties for late renewals)\
For a granular, constantly updated price list, consult Keylink: Bahrain Company Formation Cost Guide.\
Insider Tip:\
I once underestimated the value of a good virtual office address in Seef‚Äîqueue times for document pickup were radically shorter than at MOICT‚Äôs main Manama branch.\
Budgeting Pitfall\
Allot at least BHD 2,500‚Äì4,000 for total year-one setup, including registration, basic office, and professional support. Many entrepreneurs focus on just the licensing, but overlook ongoing costs (visas, VAT compliance, office rental). That‚Äôs a rookie mistake easily avoided.\
Choosing the Right Company Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.: For trading, consulting, IT, etc.\
- Single Person Company (SPC): Perfect for solo founders or freelancers\
- Branch Office: For international groups entering Bahrain\
- Public Shareholding Company (BSC)**: For large-scale or listed ventures\
Each has its own share capital, governance, and documentation requirements. For a side note: in Bahrain, the notarization of board resolutions often happens in a casual majlis setting, with Arabic coffee and dates‚Äîunlike the strictly formal office protocol in Dubai or Riyadh.\

2. Reserve a Company Name\
Use the Sijilat portal. Priority is given to unique, non-generic trade names.\
3. Draft Constitution / Memorandum\
Templates are available via MOICT and major service providers. (I once lost a day waiting for a formal Arabic translation‚Äînow I always request bilingual documents up front.)\
4. Secure Office Address\
Physical or virtual in the correct zone. Seef and Bahrain Bay are faster for CR processing, especially on Wednesdays.\
5. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR)\
Online via Sijilat. Attach all documents, pay initial fees.\
6. Obtain Additional Approvals\
Certain industries (health, finance, education) require sector regulator approval‚Äîe.g., CBB, NHRA, Tamkeen.\
7. Register with LMRA and EWA\
For visas and utilities. Investor and employee visa deposits must be paid in advance.\
8. Open Bank Account\
Major banks (e.g., Ahli United, Bank ABC) have expedited channels for new companies.\
Timing Hack: 10:00‚Äì11:00 AM on weekdays is optimal to avoid queues.\
9. Register for VAT\

The strength of relationships is blantly obvious when the partners are in the lower numbers and better yet in the single digits, not because the pleasure of the behavior is a negative one, instead it's because the energy given to multiple partners is all or mostly dedicated to a single partner. 51 dates in a year with the same person sexually active or not is not necessary the same as 51 one night stands that started as a date[with or without protection. From the time eyes lock to the time a relationship begins there is an exchange of energy happening.

For example a male decides to speak with intent exiting the comfort zone. The intent to marry or the intent to engage in sexual activity, there is expenditure of energy. Not speaking on for fun nights strictly in relation to pair bonding. 

A woman decides whether the male is acceptable, and begins slight changes also expending energy, show her intent. Though more subtle she has a plan, first night or forever goals. The point is:

Until a person heals from their own sufferings and allows the partner to exchange those energies in balance, the those energies get dissipated quicker in one night stands, hence the walk of shame, even with the nymphos the void of multiple partners becomes noticeable eventually, specially when pair bonding begins. When the person comes to terms with the difference in experience, the trail of broken relationships begins to make sense.

On the opposite end those with fewer partners or single partners tend to develop that bond earlier and strong allowing for the relationship to strengthen through the moments of struggles that would normally trigger a ""one night stand"". Those energies spent; the phone call the text the hook up the pleasantries of getting coffee and flirting, mostly go to the dedicated partner and in a healthy relationship met with 
reciprocity. Allowing the phrase ""they have been married for 50 years"" both answers are correct as it is God's will either way, just some paths have more thorns than others.

""Women submit to your husbands, not out of fear but because he is the head. And men love your wives...""

Looking for some honest feedback to consider. My brain is locked into one train of thought and I need to make sure I‚Äôm not tunnel visioned over this issue. This is a long post. I‚Äôm sorry. I just want to provide as much info as possible so I don‚Äôt have to answer too many questions in comments to create the correct picture. 

My husband and I bought a used 2019 Ford F150 XLT from a local
Ford dealership.  When I test drove it a few days prior, the CEL was on. It wasn‚Äôt blinking. The salesman was in the front passenger seat when I asked about the light. He said some work was done on the trade in and the CEL wasn‚Äôt cleared after. I asked what work was done and he didn‚Äôt know, said Service department doesn‚Äôt tell them. Before we parted ways after the test drive I pointed out the right front tire was low. I asked him to follow up with Service and update me after the test drive. He updated me the next day telling me all was good and the truck was back on the lot if we were still interested.  I test drove the truck again and the CEL was not on. 

The day of signing, we looked everything over - top, bottom, inside and out. Nothing wrong. No wet stains on the pavement from leaks. No CEL.  We really went over it well. We signed and took the truck home. All was good. I also had the car fax print out which included the service work completed when the truck was traded 3 weeks prior. No major issues, just routine maintenance including oil change, tire rotation, brakes. No mention of CEL or any major repairs that would trigger the CEL. 

15 hours later while my husband was at work a half hour away from home  in a hard to navigate busy tourist area, the CEL came on while driving. He stopped the truck, checked all he could think of including fluids and found the oil dipstick to be dry. He bought oil and it took 3 quarts to fill to max line in the dipstick. CEL light remained on. He called me, gave me details and I called the dealership. After a few calls the solution was to tow the vehicle back to the dealership and provide my husband with a loaner so he could finish the work day. I stayed with the truck at the dealership to assure I knew everything that was going on with the truck. I was not leaving without answers and I wanted to see who was talking to who when they didn‚Äôt know I was watching/listening. I was there for 4 hours. 

The service manager visited me twice to update me. While I waited I used the customer waiting area computers to do my own research. I knew the oil light would come on with low oil but not the CEL unless the oil pressure was so low there was worse damage. I‚Äôm not car/truck stupid. I won‚Äôt waste time explaining how. To say I was concerned was an understatement. We hadn‚Äôt had the truck in our possession for a full 24 hours yet. Service was able to pull the CEL history and the codes associated are P0430 & P0456, neither are associated with 3 missing quarts of oil. The codes represent a misfire, which could be the result of many things like a bad spark plug, coil pack and so on. 

Service drained all the oil, added a new oil filter and the required quarts of oil. Service manager stated he wasn‚Äôt sure why the CEL came on over 3 quarts of low oil. He thinks maybe his technician of 10 years got sidetracked when changing the oil weeks earlier and didn‚Äôt put the right amount of oil in. While I understand mistakes happen and no experienced person is above making them, had it been anymore than 3 quarts this could have been a costly mistake. 

Service manager gave us homework over the weekend, drive it, check oil when cold and report back Monday the 15th with findings and or feedback. So we did just that. I even called a family mechanic we‚Äôve used for many years and trust. He told us what to listen for for lower and upper engine damage sounds. He also told us an existing issue that triggers a CEL doesn‚Äôt go away. Even if the CEL is cleared, a few drive sessions will eventually trigger it again. This means ‚Ä¶. When I test drove it and saw the CEL, salesperson gave me some bs answer, it was cleared again in Service without fixing the problem and then sold to us. I even asked the salesperson on the day we were to come in to sign, to run the truck through service again and make sure all is good. He said he did. If that was the case how did 3 missing quarts of oil go unnoticed? Anyway, Friday and Saturday, we drove it. All checked out. Oil stayed at max level when tested cold. No CEL.  Sunday morning, oil still at max level while cold. Took it for a short drive for Sunday coffee and there it was again: the CEL light. 

Husband called off work for Monday the 15th and we will be at the dealership service door at 8:30am when they open. 

Here are my questions: 

1- Were we scammed by the Ford dealership into thinking this truck was good to purchase? In our minds, if the CEL was on in your possession and your service department cleared it, surely you would know the codes and what they mean? Why clear the codes and not fix the problem? 

2- Salesman said he doesn‚Äôt have access to the service department information and they aren‚Äôt kept in the loop or  updated. Is this true? 

3- I asked for service records from this dealership when they towed the truck in. I was told I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have them. Is this true? I have the car fax report but want the internal dealership service records showing me what was really done. As the owner, am I entitled to them? This isn‚Äôt healthcare - there‚Äôs no Hippa involved. Why am I not allowed to see them? 

4- While we do have a Ford warranty on the truck, service manager said they were taking care of it and we owed nothing for any repairs since we hadn‚Äôt had the truck more than 15 hours when the truck was towed back. What if this issue is too costly to fix in their eyes and they bail on responsibility. Are we screwed? 

5- The warm fuzzy feelings about having a newer vehicle disappeared as we watched the tow truck tow it away. And all weekend we‚Äôve had knots in our stomachs over this, loss wages and time, bad feelings and words about it all as well as the stress of anticipating what next steps are on Monday the 15th. Do we have to keep this truck? 

6- Is the dealership in the wrong for selling us a truck with known issues without disclosing them? Do we have any legal standing in this situation? We are in Michigan. In Michigan, the lemon law only applies to new (2025) vehicles only. 

Thank you to anyone providing feedback.

Problem was always rush hour traffic. I started at 8am on average if I left at 6:45am I'd arrive at 7:40, If I left at 6:50am I'd arrive at 8:05am. So every morning at 6am I'd scramble to wash, feed the cats and eat breakfast and get out by 6:45am. I'm lazy and sleepy by nature so it's hard.

Thing is the earlier I leave, the shorter my commute always is. So one day I decided, up at 6am, wash, cats out by 6:25. I arrived at 7am. I bring breakfast and spend a whole hour chilling, eating toast and fruit with a couple of cups of coffee. The stress of travel is less, I have to navigate past few cars, bus only lanes don't become bus only lanes until 7am and I'm no longer worrying am I going to be late, am I going to be late.

Better still instead of making coffee, breakfast and cramming everything in, in under 10 minutes or risk being late. I get to relax for an hour, eat a bigger breakfast, have more coffee and start work refreshed and well fed. I've been doing this 9 months now and its made a huge difference. I barely realized how badly driving to work, worrying about being late then starting a shift wore me down. Now even if its a stressful drive for whatever reason, I have time to relax and eat. By the time lunch comes round I'm no longer starving because breakfast was five hours ago instead of six.

But best of all, I get to sit on my ass and relax for 1 hour. Occasionally I have to ask the janitors to open my part of the building, but its a small price to pay.",12,1757904909.0,work,6,1.0,False

I would say I am fairly experienced, from working at a coffee shop, to piddling around with my own machine for a while. Main coffees that I make at home and for friends are lattes and cappuccinos, every once in a while ill make myself an americano. I do want to stick with one group head, no reason for me to go bigger.

I love the industrial look of some machines, so I want to stick with the LELIT Biancca, Rocket Appartamento, LUCCA Solo style machines. I have also heard good things about the Profitec Pro 500. My goal is to stay under/around $2K (USD). Anyone have some of these machines, and would give me some advice on which one would do me best?

1nhajwz,https://i.redd.it/16wgq6z7t8pf1.png,Love After a Toxic Marriage | arrived at the Palo Alto headquarters before the sun had fully risen,"Chapter 1

I arrived at the Palo Alto headquarters before the sun had fully risen, my heels clicking against the polished marble floor of the empty lobby. Five years of my life had gone into this building, into Ryan's company‚Äîour company, though you'd never hear him say it. Today was everything we'd worked for: the Series B funding pitch that would either launch us into tech stardom or leave us struggling for another year.

My fingers trembled slightly as I arranged the presentation packets for the fifth time, aligning their edges with mathematical precision. Each folder contained months of my work‚Äîfinancial projections, market analyses, growth strategies‚Äîall meticulously prepared for the venture capitalists who held our future in their hands.

""You're here early,"" Madison's syrupy voice cut through the silence, startling me. She stood in the doorway of the conference room, a vision in pale pink, her blonde hair falling in perfect waves around her shoulders. ""Let me help you with those.""

""I've got it,"" I said, perhaps too quickly. Something in her eager smile made my stomach tighten. ""But thank you.""

She tilted her head, eyes widening with practiced innocence. ""Ryan asked me to make sure everything's perfect for the Westbrook Capital team. You know how important this is to him.""

To him. Not to us. Never to us.

""I know exactly how important it is,"" I replied, my voice steady despite the familiar ache her words triggered. ""That's why I've been preparing for three months.""

She nodded, backing away with that same saccharine smile. ""Of course. I'll just go check on the refreshments.""

I watched her leave, then turned back to my presentation slides on the laptop. Everything was in order‚ÄîI'd triple-checked each number, each projection. This deal was going to happen. It had to.

By nine o'clock, the conference room hummed with anticipation. David Chen from Westbrook Capital sat at the head of the table, flanked by his team of analysts. Ryan worked the room with his trademark charm, all confident handshakes and practiced laughter.

""Let's get started,"" David announced, folding his hands on the table. ""We're eager to see what Mitchell Tech has to offer.""

Ryan nodded at me‚Äîmy cue. I stood, smoothing my skirt, and began the presentation I could recite in my sleep. The words flowed easily as I outlined our company vision, our market position, our competitive advantage. The room was with me; I could feel it in the way they leaned forward, in their thoughtful nods.

And then I clicked to the next slide‚Äîthe crucial financial projections that would demonstrate our path to profitability.

It wasn't there.

My heart stuttered. I clicked again. Nothing. The spreadsheets‚Äîthe backbone of our entire pitch‚Äîwere missing.

""Is there a problem?"" David asked, his interest visibly cooling.

""Just a small technical issue,"" I managed, frantically searching through my files. But I knew. I knew exactly what had happened. Who had happened.

Ryan's face hardened as he realized something was wrong. ""Sarah?""

""The financial projections are missing from the presentation,"" I said quietly, fighting to keep my voice level. ""But I have them here‚Äî""

""Missing?"" David's eyebrow arched. ""This is the third meeting I've had with your company where critical information was somehow 'missing.'""

The room temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. The other investors exchanged glances.

""Mr. Chen, if you'll just give me one moment‚Äî"" I began, but he was already standing, gathering his papers.

""I think we've seen enough,"" he said coldly. ""A company that can't manage its own presentation materials is hardly ready for eight-figure investments. Gentlemen?""

They filed out, Ryan's desperate attempts to salvage the meeting falling on deaf ears. When the door closed behind them, the silence was deafening.

I turned slowly to face Madison, who sat in the corner, her eyes already glistening with manufactured tears.

""What did you do?"" My voice was barely a whisper.

""I‚ÄîI don't understand,"" she stammered, looking around at the gathering employees. ""I was just trying to help organize the presentation last night...""

""This is the third time,"" I said, my voice gaining strength with each word. ""The third time you've 'accidentally' sabotaged my work. The Henderson contract. The Fujikawa partnership. And now this.""

Ryan stepped between us, his face thunderous. ""That's enough, Sarah.""

""Enough?"" I stared at him in disbelief. ""We just lost our Series B funding because your assistant deleted critical files!""

""Madison was trying to help,"" he snapped, placing a protective hand on her shoulder. ""Unlike you, she doesn't make everything about herself.""

The room spun slightly. Five years of sacrifice, of swallowing my pride, of building his dream while burying mine, and this was what it had come to.

""Sarah,"" Ryan's voice cut through the office like a blade, ""you need to apologize to Madison. Now.""

Something inside me‚Äîsomething that had been bending for years‚Äîfinally broke.

""No,"" I said, the word unfamiliar but exhilarating on my tongue. ""I quit. And Ryan? I want a divorce.""

The gasps around the room barely registered as I gathered my belongings, my hands steady for the first time that day. As I walked toward the door, I caught Madison's eye. Behind the facade of shock, I saw something else‚Äîfear. She knew what I'd just realized: her game was finally over.

Chapter 2

I stumbled through the parking garage, my vision blurred by tears I refused to let fall. The click of my heels echoed against concrete walls, matching the thundering of my heart. Five years. Five years of my life sacrificed for a man who had just publicly humiliated me to protect his mistress.

My hands shook as I fumbled with my car keys, dropping them twice before managing to unlock the door. Once inside, I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white, trying to steady my breathing. The air conditioning blasted against my face, but it couldn't cool the rage burning through my veins.

""Enough,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's finally enough.""

I reached for my phone and scrolled to a contact I hadn't called in months. Michael would be in a meeting now‚Äîhe always was‚Äîbut this couldn't wait. Not anymore.

He answered on the second ring. ""Sarah?""

""Pull everything,"" I said, my voice steadier than I expected. ""Every dollar you've invested in Ryan's company. Pull it all. Today.""

A beat of silence. Then, ""What happened?""

""I just quit. And I'm divorcing him."" The words felt surreal coming from my mouth, yet somehow they were the most honest thing I'd said in years.

""Thank God,"" Michael exhaled, the relief in his voice unmistakable. ""Are you okay? Where are you?""

""Parking garage. I'm fine."" I wasn't, but I would be. ""Michael, I need you to listen. This isn't just about our marriage. Ryan's been lying to everyone. His precious assistant Madison has been systematically sabotaging my work, and he's been covering for her. Today she deleted our entire financial projection section before the Westbrook Capital pitch.""

""Chen was there?"" Michael's voice sharpened. ""Jesus, Sarah.""

""Pull your investment,"" I repeated. ""Pull it now.""

""Consider it done."" The sound of typing filtered through the phone. ""I'm messaging my team as we speak. Every share we own will be liquidated by market close.""

""Thank you."" My throat tightened. ""I'm sorry I didn't listen to you about him.""

""Don't,"" Michael said firmly. ""Just tell me where you're going. You're not going back to that house, are you?""

I hadn't thought that far ahead. The idea of returning to the modern glass mansion Ryan had insisted on buying‚Äîa showpiece, not a home‚Äîmade my stomach turn.

""I need to get some things first,"" I said. ""Then I'll figure it out.""

""My guest room is yours. No arguments."" His tone softened. ""Sarah, I've been waiting for this call for five years. Whatever you need, I'm here.""

After hanging up, I sat motionless, watching executives in expensive suits walk to their cars, their lives continuing as if mine hadn't just imploded. The numbness was wearing off, reality seeping in. I had no job. Soon, no husband. I'd walked away from everything I'd built.

No. Everything I'd helped him build.

Two hours later, I stood in Ryan's home office, methodically packing my personal files. The house was silent‚Äîhe was probably still at the office, damage-controlling the fallout from my dramatic exit. Or comforting Madison.

I pulled open his desk drawer, searching for the external hard drive that contained backups of my work. Instead, my fingers brushed against a stack of printed emails. I shouldn't have looked. But something‚Äîinstinct, perhaps‚Äîmade me pull them out.

The first email was from Madison to Ryan, dated three months ago:

""Took care of the Henderson slides like you asked. She'll never know what happened. Dinner tonight to celebrate? The usual place where no one knows you're married? ;)""

My hands trembled as I flipped through more pages. Receipts for jewelry. Hotel confirmations. And multiple references to ""fixing"" my presentations.

It hadn't been accidental sabotage. It had been deliberate. Planned. Between the two of them.

I sank into Ryan's chair, the evidence spread before me like a roadmap of betrayal. All those nights I'd worked until dawn, all those weekends sacrificed, all those miscarriages I'd endured alone while he was ""at the office""‚Äîit had all been a lie.

My phone buzzed with a text from Michael: ""It's done. $4.2 million withdrawn. Ryan's stock is already dropping.""

I stared at the message, a strange calm settling over me. This wasn't the end.

It was just the beginning.

Chapter 3

The afternoon sun slanted through the windows of Verve Coffee as I waited, my fingers drumming an anxious rhythm on the ceramic mug. Three days had passed since my dramatic exit from Mitchell Tech, and the numbness was beginning to wear off, replaced by a cold, calculated fury that surprised even me.

When Chloe Evans walked in, I almost didn't recognize her. The confident executive assistant I'd known had been replaced by someone more subdued, her once-perfect posture slightly hunched as if perpetually bracing for impact. Madison's handiwork, no doubt.

""Sarah,"" she said, sliding into the seat across from me. ""I almost didn't come.""

""Thank you for taking the risk,"" I replied, pushing a latte toward her. ""I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't important.""

She wrapped her hands around the mug but didn't drink. ""Everyone's talking about how you walked out. Some people are calling it a nervous breakdown."" Her eyes met mine. ""But that's not what happened, is it?""

""No."" I leaned forward. ""Chloe, I need to know what really happened when you were fired.""

Something flickered across her face‚Äîfear, then resolve. She reached into her bag and pulled out her phone. ""I kept everything. I knew nobody would believe me otherwise.""

She slid the phone across the table. On the screen was a series of screenshots‚Äîemails, memos, all meticulously organized. I scrolled through them, my stomach clenching tighter with each swipe.

Draft emails from Madison to the board, written in my name, containing subtle errors that made me look incompetent. Calendar invitations deliberately rescheduled. Files with key data points altered.

""She did the same thing to me that she did to you,"" Chloe said quietly. ""Except I didn't have a paper trail to prove it wasn't my mistakes. And I didn't have a husband in the C-suite.""

""Ex-husband,"" I corrected automatically, still scrolling. ""How long did you collect these?""

""Six months. From the day she started working closely with Ryan."" Chloe's voice hardened. ""She's done this before, at Meridian Systems. She targets women who threaten her access to powerful men.""

I looked up sharply. ""How do you know that?""

""Because I've been doing my homework since she got me fired."" A hint of the old Chloe emerged‚Äîcompetent, thorough. ""There are at least three other women with stories just like ours.""

My phone buzzed with an encrypted message from Emily Vance: \*Meeting you was risky but worth it. Attached: Ryan's latest board memo. Company in freefall since you left. Missed projections by 40%. Madison blaming finance team. Three resignations yesterday.\*

I opened the attachment, scanning Ryan's desperate attempts to explain the company's sudden downturn. Without my strategic guidance, he was flailing‚Äîexactly as I'd expected.

""Thank you, Chloe,"" I said, forwarding both her evidence and Emily's memo to my secure email. ""This helps more than you know.""

She hesitated before standing. ""What are you going to do with all this?""

I smiled for the first time in days. ""Justice.""

Back in my temporary office at Michael's investment firm, I stared at my laptop screen, my finger hovering over the call button. James Parker's profile photo looked back at me‚Äîolder than I remembered, his features more defined, but with the same steady gaze that had once made me feel seen in a way Ryan never had.

Before I could overthink it, I clicked.

Three rings, then his face filled my screen. The London skyline glowed behind him in the early evening light.

""Sarah."" Just my name, but the way he said it‚Äîlike a prayer, like coming home‚Äîmade my carefully constructed composure waver.

""James."" I swallowed hard. ""I need your help.""

Something in his expression cracked at my words, the professional veneer slipping to reveal raw emotion underneath. ""What happened?""

I told him everything‚Äîthe sabotage, the betrayal, the divorce, the evidence I'd gathered. He listened without interrupting, his jaw tightening as I spoke.

""I'll be on the next flight,"" he said when I finished, already reaching for his phone. ""This isn't something we should discuss over video.""

""James, you don't have to‚Äî""

""I do."" His voice was firm. ""I've been waiting five years to be there for you, Sarah. I'm not missing my chance again.""

The call ended, and I sat back in my chair, a strange lightness spreading through my chest. For the first time since walking out of Mitchell Tech, I felt something other than rage or pain.

I felt hope.

My phone buzzed with a text from Ryan: \*We need to talk. Coming to Michael's office tomorrow. This has gone too far.\*

I smiled as I typed my reply: \*Perfect timing. I'll have company.\*

1nhajgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nhajgn/unsure_of_academic_direction/,Unsure of academic direction,"hey all, this is a long one. TLDR at the bottom

Having a hard time deciding on a direction in life- I‚Äôm 22, and I work at a starbucks. I am tired of working at starbucks and I want to pursue a way of making more money. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in ASU online for free with starbucks‚Äôs free enrollment benefit. over the years i‚Äôve talked to soooo many academic advisors and i still don‚Äôt really know what in higher education i‚Äôd like to move forward with. 

as a little background, i took a college prep class in high school, went to a semester of my community college, and went to a real on campus university for about a year. Both my parents went to universities, my dad has a bachelors in culinary arts and my mom has a masters in computer tech with a nursing minor. my mom is an immigrant and my dad is a normal white guy so the emphasis of school on my life has always been really serious. in high school i was never allowed to take art classes even though i‚Äôm an extremely artistic person, and acedemically i found myself being more math and science. i was good at chemistry, bad at biology, and pretty good at geometry but i think thats because of my teachers tbh. any time ive enrolled in universities ive always done something science related, except for when i enrolled in regular university as a political justice major, but later changed to conservation and restoration ecology, and currently im enrolled in psych. 

Honestly, i‚Äôve never really cared about school except for the social and arts part. i don‚Äôt get acedemic validation very easy, it just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. and that hasn‚Äôt changed, i really don‚Äôt care about school i just want to make more money to enjoy more other stuff in life. I wouldnt say im very book smart, and i don‚Äôt really enjoy learning in a structured environment like school. I‚Äôm not very self motivating at all. I‚Äôm the ‚Äútried to k***** myself at 16 and didn‚Äôt plan for anything after that‚Äùperson, and i‚Äôm just now realizing after being out of an abusive house for the past few years- that the future exists and you can plan for it! my old goal i‚Äôve ever really had was to move out and be completely self reliant and safe from my family and i accomplished that when i was 18, so after that ive been riding on that high- only recently ive really understood the vertues of life and how straight up survival isn‚Äôt the only thing to live for. For everyone else the obvious answer would be to do something in art but 1- i don‚Äôt want to ruin anything artistic for myself by making it into a job and 2- maybe its just what my parents have fed me but i don‚Äôt think i could find something that would make me money- especially in this economic political climate. 
i think im too stupid to do anything in math or science, i don‚Äôt really want to be a therapist because i have a history of mental illness, and i don‚Äôt keep up with the news enough anymore to continue in social justice. i was thinking of getting into the trades but i don‚Äôt want to do a manual labor job for the next 50 years and work insane hours, and the thought of a stagnant phone call office job makes me want to rip my eyes out. Also as beautiful and important i think the roles of teachers are- especially now- i can‚Äôt see myself working with kids and teacher are really really getting the  shit end of the stick- mad respect. sales and/or making my own small business is also out of the question, it‚Äôs scary and manipulative imo- i also want a job i know AI won‚Äôt take eventually. I don‚Äôt even really care about coffee really- i like the benifits and job security i have, i‚Äôve been working there for 4 years now and i know it so well i don‚Äôt even have to put a lot of effort into my job when i come in, i like my op lol coworkers and chatting during work but still getting everything done, i like my regulars and i like being able to make someone‚Äôs day with a free coffee and it‚Äôs absolutely no sweat off my back. i love being able to have food always when im in a tough financial pinch even if it‚Äôs just starbucks food and i love giving my friends and family coffee and discounts and free lyft rides and such, i also like that i can contribute to my 401k with a 5% match!! I do like unions, farmers, agriculture, conservation of everything- art, animals, the world, culture, music, natural medicine practices, recipes, all of it! i like to explore and research but only things im interested in 

i‚Äôve really just been feeling shit out of luck, i don‚Äôt stick with things very well so my current thought is to work the minimum amount of hours at work possible to maintain my benefit, take out a loan to cover part of my rent and other living expenses for the time- and taking out a loan will also help my credit score during this time so my credit cards (that will probably be run up like crazy) aren‚Äôt the only things controlling my credit, and power through as much school as i can like that, i think i only have about 2ish years if im doing constant school (year round). but i‚Äôve also heard the advise to never ever take out loans so i‚Äôm not sure. 

the reason i don‚Äôt ask my parents is because my dad is now a phone salesman for the past 25 years and works at home depot part time, and my mom was pretty successful for about 24 years but became an wxtreme binge drinker because of the stress, lost her job, and honestly- is not a very good role model. i don‚Äôt think she has advice to offer that i‚Äôd like to take. 

i don‚Äôt really have another trusted adult i look up to in my life right now that i can ask advice from so i go to the internet now. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any advice, anything at all. and i understand that everything ive said doesnt leave a lot of other options- there‚Äôs no amount of ‚Äújust suck it up‚Äùs‚Äô and ‚Äútough shit‚Äù i haven‚Äôt already heard, im just coming on here wondering if i really am just shit out of luck and should try to apply myself to something that might ruin an aspect of life for me because i‚Äôm forced to to it professionally. 

if i had to short form my skills and interests i would say that it takes me a while to learn things but once i do i‚Äôm very very good at it, i‚Äôm adaptable, i am good at talking to people even though im not extremely fond of it. i‚Äôm very good at multi tasking and i‚Äôd like to think i‚Äôm pretty understanding. i‚Äôm good with my hands and i‚Äôm strong- a ‚Äúfix-it‚Äù, o work best in medium positions of power (i‚Äôve been a general manager at almost every job i‚Äôve ever had) i‚Äôm pretty committed to whatever place i work for. i also do a lot of art in my free time- i also make and hem clothes too. politically and morally- in short form- id say im a semi radical punk, bordering eco/natural punk. i‚Äôm a big connoisseur of music but i don‚Äôt play any instruments. i have before tho- im a band/choir kid. although not formally diagnosed- people would describe me as definitely somewhere on the spectrum, i like to cook and i‚Äôm moderately into health, and i like to spend a lot of time alone but not completely alone. i‚Äôm not looking for a job where i‚Äôm earning a million dollars a year with an insane work load, i‚Äôm just looking to be able to send my mom flowers and buy a sandwich without worrying if i‚Äôm gonna miss eating that week, yk? not shooting for the stars 

tldr: I‚Äôm 22, working at Starbucks, and using their free ASU tuition but I feel stuck on what direction to take. School has never really motivated me, I‚Äôve switched majors a lot, and I don‚Äôt want to turn my art into a job or end up in something I‚Äôll hate like sales, teaching, therapy, or decades of manual labor. I like conservation, agriculture, culture, music, and hands-on work, and I‚Äôm adaptable, good at multitasking, and usually end up in leadership roles. I just want stability and enough money to live comfortably without ruining the things I love, but I‚Äôm not sure what career path makes sense for me. all advice welcome !

Chapter 1: Not Begging Anymore

I gave her my organ. She took my husband in return.

When Lavinia was dying, I bled for her. I thought sacrifice would make us family. Instead, it made me a fool.

Months later, weak from surgery, I walked into a clinic and froze. My husband sat beside her, his hand on hers.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Lav,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of you‚Äîand our baby.‚Äù

My scar ached. My world collapsed. The sister I saved was carrying my husband‚Äôs child!

‚ÄúErin gave me her organ,‚Äù Lavinia said, smirking. ‚ÄúBut you gave me your love. She‚Äôll never understand what we have, Trev.‚Äù

And she was right‚ÄîI don‚Äôt. I never will.

I was grieving but clarity slapped me with the messy truth. So that afternoon, I decided to end things on my terms.

I‚Äôm done with betrayal.

I'll show them how it's done.

One word‚ÄîDivorce.

I'm leaving my husband‚Ä¶for real!

\--

For four years, I‚Äôve been a wife, a fool, and nothing more than his second choice.

The photo of a sonogram trembled in my hand. I was supposed to be happy‚Äîif only the baby was mine. But the harsh truth‚Äîit was Lavinia's‚Äîmy stepsister and my husband's lover. I stared at it until the edges blurred, until bile threatened to rise in my throat.

He was here, in the room, watching me. Silent. Almost smug. The air between us carried everything I had tried not to see‚Äîher perfume on his shirts, his sudden late nights, the way his eyes dimmed whenever they landed on me.

I finally spoke, though my voice sounded foreign, raw.

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

Trevor didn‚Äôt flinch. His expression was flat, almost bored. ‚ÄúDoes it matter?‚Äù

A crack opened in my chest, and still I pressed on. ‚ÄúOf all people, why did it have to be my stepsister?‚Äù

His smirk confirmed what I already knew. He didn‚Äôt bother denying. He didn‚Äôt even try to soften the blow. Instead, his gaze slid over me, cold and assessing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve let yourself go,‚Äù he said, tone detached, like he was listing facts. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different. She makes me feel alive.‚Äù

The words cut deeper than if he‚Äôd shouted them. Alive. As though with me, he‚Äôd been dead.

I held his stare, refusing to let him see me unravel. Inside, my heart was clawing at my ribs, screaming to shatter, but I swallowed the sound. He would not have the satisfaction.

Once, I would have begged him to choose me. Tonight, I chose myself.

I turned, walked to the drawer, and pulled out the envelope I‚Äôd been hiding for weeks. My hand didn‚Äôt shake as I laid it on the bed.

Trevor‚Äôs brow arched. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this supposed to be?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour freedom,‚Äù I said, my voice steady though my chest was burning in rage. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt choke on it.‚Äù

I left before he could speak again, slamming the door behind me. The echo rang through the hall like the final toll of a bell. For the first time in four years, the air filling my lungs didn‚Äôt taste like defeat. I don't deserve this kind of cruelty. I was done and so was my feelings for him.

Chapter 2: No Flinch, Just Itch

The slam of the bedroom door still echoed in my ears as I moved down the hallway. Each step felt heavier, though my chest was strangely lighter‚Äîas if setting down the divorce papers had carved a space inside me for air again.

I should have gone straight to the car. Straight out of the house that had become a mausoleum for my marriage. The walls no longer carried warmth, only shadows of what we used to be. But of course, fate had other plans. Lavinia was waiting for me. Not to comfort but to insult me in my own house. She leaned against the banister at the top of the stairs, her silk robe clinging to her body in that calculated way of hers. By the looks of it, she looked entertained.

‚ÄúAt last, the truth had set us free,‚Äù she said softly, almost like a condolence. ‚ÄúI was actually planning to tell you myself but look where the situation led us.‚Äù The sound of her voice ignited something sharp in my chest. She wasn‚Äôt even pretending to be discreet anymore.

‚ÄúI hope you enjoy my leftovers, stepsis,‚Äù I snapped, glaring at her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that, Erin.‚Äù Her voice was honey over venom. ‚ÄúThis is all your fault. Trevor deserves someone who excites him. You were never enough. Just accept the fact that you‚Äôre a loser.‚Äù

The words should have split me open. Maybe last week they would have. Tonight, they only forged steel in my spine. I turned to her, my voice quiet but lethal. ‚ÄúThen congratulations, Lavinia. I hope he'll make you and your baby happy.‚Äù

Her smirk flickered, faltered for just a beat. That was enough for me to take. I descended the stairs, my heels striking the wood like a war drum, announcing my exit. The keys in my hand felt cold, solid, real‚Äîmy ticket out.

By the time I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, the weight of betrayal and humiliation pressed down like a mountain. I gripped the wheel until my knuckles blanched, fighting the sob that burned at the back of my throat. But I didn‚Äôt let it out. Not yet. Not while they were in that house, clinging to each other like victors on stolen ground.

I started the engine. I was half-expecting Trevor would follow but he didn't. Fine. He could rot in the silence I left behind. The city blurred past, streetlights flashing like gold streaks on the windshield. For a brief, fragile moment, I thought I might breathe again.

Until I noticed the headlights in my rearview mirror. Too close. Panic crept into my nerves, scratching at the edges of my calmness. I gripped the wheel tighter as I took a sharp right into an empty side street, pulling over beneath a flickering lamp post. The following car rolled up behind me, its engine low, steady.

My breath caught into my throat. Then the door opened. And out stepped a familiar man I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. Henry‚Äîthe guy I ghosted back in the day.

He approached the driver‚Äôs side, raising a hand in cautious greeting. ‚ÄúErin. Don‚Äôt panic. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

I blinked, stunned, my heart stumbling over itself. ‚ÄúHenry?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Henry Silva.‚Äù His voice was calm, reassuring, the same tone he used to have when pulling me back from the edge of my storms. ‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd need someone on your side tonight.‚Äù

My lips parted, but no words came. Of all the ghosts from my past, I hadn‚Äôt expected this one. I thought I had left him behind years ago, buried with the choices I never made. But here he was‚Äîmy defender, the man who once knew me before I lost myself. And now, fate had delivered him back into my life on the same night I finally walked away from my good-for-nothing husband.

Chapter 3: Masculine Jeopardy

I needed air.

I needed clarity.

And more than anything, I needed a plan.

That‚Äôs how I ended up sitting across from Henry Silva in the quiet corner of a downtown restaurant. The kind of place where no one looked too closely at who you were or why you were there.

Henry hadn‚Äôt changed much. Sharp suit, sharper eyes, and that steady calm he always carried, the kind that made people trust him even when they shouldn‚Äôt. Once, years ago, I had trusted him with my heart. Now, I was trusting him with my freedom.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to scare you earlier,‚Äù Henry said, his fingers wrapped around the zarf of his coffee cup. He barely touched it yet.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt scare me,‚Äù I murmured, though my hands still trembled faintly around the rim of my cup. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt expecting you.‚Äù

He nodded, eyes catching mine. ‚ÄúI know. I wouldn‚Äôt expect that either. But when I saw your name on the case file‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt stay detached. I wanted to handle it myself.‚Äù

Silence fell between us, but it wasn‚Äôt heavy. It was the kind of silence that once defined us‚Äîwhen a glance said more than hours of conversation ever could. For a fleeting moment, I felt like the younger version of myself, the girl who used to believe love could be enough.

I wrapped my hands around the glass of water in front of me, trying to stop them from trembling. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt even deny it, Henry. He looked me in the eye and basically said I was‚Ä¶ boring. That Lavinia makes him feel alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did the right thing, Erin,‚Äù he said, his voice low but firm, scanning the documents I‚Äôd brought along. ‚ÄúFiling now protects you. The longer you wait, the more leverage Trevor gets.‚Äù

Henry‚Äôs jaw tightened. For a second, the polished lawyer facade slipped, and I caught a flash of the man I used to know‚Äîthe one who hated seeing me hurt.

My throat tightened, tears pressing against the corners of my eyes. I swallowed them back, the way I always did.

‚ÄúHenry‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice cracked before I could stop it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not boring,‚Äù he said, more sharply than I expected. His gaze softened a beat later. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying to make you doubt yourself so you‚Äôll back down. But you‚Äôre stronger than that.‚Äù

Stronger. The word settled in me like an anchor. I wanted to believe it. We spent the next half hour going over paperwork, strategies, and the ugly logistics of unraveling a marriage.

He was all business, but every so often, his eyes lingered a little too long, his tone softened a little too much. And then the bell over the caf√© door jingled, and I felt the air shift before I even looked up.

Trevor.

He stood at the entrance, his expression unreadable as his gaze landed on us‚Äîon me, sitting across from Henry.The moment stretched, thick with unsaid words.

My heart raced. I hadn‚Äôt wanted him to follow me, hadn‚Äôt even cared if he noticed I was gone. But now, here he was, and the sight of Henry across from me was a truth I couldn‚Äôt hide.

And for the first time tonight, it wasn‚Äôt betrayal or humiliation that burned in Trevor‚Äôs eyes. It was jealousy.

He might have lost me tonight‚Äîbut he wasn‚Äôt about to let me go without treating his wounded ego.

Chapter 4: So Rich Coming From You

Trevor‚Äôs stare cut through the caf√© like glass, slicing straight into me. He didn‚Äôt move at first, just stood there with that self-righteous posture that used to make me think he was a man of principle.

Now I know better. That posture wasn‚Äôt about principles but control. I'm sure he didn‚Äôt have any at this point.

Henry shifted in his seat. I could feel the tension rolling off him, sharp and silent, like a storm gathering just offshore. He didn‚Äôt break eye contact with Trevor, didn‚Äôt flinch. That, more than anything, made Trevor walk toward us.

Every step echoed in my chest. He stopped at our table, his gaze flicking between us, then dropping to the open file of divorce papers on the table.

‚ÄúSo this is how low you‚Äôll go,‚Äù Trevor said, his voice calm, but his jaw tight. ‚ÄúRunning to your old flame like a wounded little girl. Pathetic move, Erin.‚Äù

My cheeks burned. Anger, shame, fury‚Äîit all tangled together. But before I could respond, Henry leaned back in his chair, utterly composed.

‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù Henry said evenly, his voice carrying that lawyer‚Äôs precision. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on dangerous ground speaking to her like that. Especially in public.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs mouth twitched, but he didn‚Äôt look at Henry again. His eyes locked on me instead.

‚ÄúDid you come running to him the second you walked out? Is that how little I meant to you?‚Äù he hissed, low enough that only we could hear.

The words stung, but I held his gaze. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt flatter yourself. You lost me long before tonight.‚Äù

For a moment, his mask slipped. Hurt flashed across his face, raw and unguarded. But then it twisted into something darker, uglier.

‚ÄúYou think he cares about you?‚Äù Trevor sneered, jabbing a finger at Henry. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs using you, Erin. He always did. You were just too blind to see it.‚Äù

Henry‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but I reached across the table first, resting my hand over Henry‚Äôs. It wasn‚Äôt calculated. It wasn‚Äôt even entirely intentional. But the second I did it, Trevor‚Äôs eyes flared with something primal.

Possessiveness.

It was alluring and terrifying all at once.

Henry didn‚Äôt move his hand away. He let it rest beneath mine, steady, warm, a silent show of solidarity that said more than words ever could.

‚ÄúLeave, Trevor,‚Äù I whispered. My voice was low but edged with steel I hadn‚Äôt heard from myself in years. ‚ÄúGo back to your mistress. Or better yet, crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of when you decided I wasn‚Äôt enough.‚Äù

The vein in his temple pulsed. He leaned closer, his voice razor-thin. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to regret this, Erin. Both of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in court,‚Äù I said coldly, eyes still locked on him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think for a second you‚Äôre walking away clean, Mr. Larusso.‚Äù

He gave me a hard look. For a second, I thought he was going to rebut. Yet, he left, the door slamming shut behind him.

Chapter 5: Granted Versus Chaos

The courtroom smelled faintly of wood polish and old books, a place where lives were dismantled and rebuilt on paper. My palms were slick against the table, though I forced myself to sit upright, shoulders squared. Across from me, Trevor sat in his pressed navy suit, calm, smug, as though he had already won something I hadn‚Äôt yet realized I‚Äôd lost.

Henry leaned close, his voice steady. ‚ÄúStay calm. Today‚Äôs procedural. The judge has everything she needs.‚Äù

I nodded, though my chest pounded. The proceedings blurred into a haze of voices, documents, and the gavel‚Äôs echo. My mind clung only to the words that mattered.

‚ÄúThe court hereby grants the dissolution of marriage between Erin and Trevor Larusso.‚Äù

It was done. Just like that, the years I spent trying to save us were reduced to a ruling and a stamp. Trevor didn‚Äôt look at me. He stood swiftly, buttoning his jacket with the ease of someone who had been waiting for this day, for my erasure.

Henry gathered our papers and touched my arm lightly‚Äîa gesture that steadied me, if only for a second. But the storm wasn‚Äôt behind the oak doors. It was waiting outside. Lavinia leaned against the marble column in the courthouse hallway like she belonged there.

Her silk blouse clung to her, her lips painted a victorious shade of red. The sight of her standing there, waiting for me, was almost worse than the judge‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù she purred as soon as she spotted me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve officially made me Mrs. Larusso without the boring ceremony.‚Äù

I tried to step past her, but she slid into my path, her eyes glittering with malice.

‚ÄúYou gave me your organ once, Erin. And now‚Äîyour husband.‚Äù She tilted her head, smiling sweetly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a giver. How does it feel, watching me live the life you could never hold onto?‚Äù

Her words sliced deep, reopening wounds I thought had already scarred.

‚ÄúEnjoy it while it lasts,‚Äù I said quietly, though my voice carried steel. ‚ÄúBecause everything Trevor touches eventually falls apart.‚Äù

Her expression darkened. Then, before I could brace myself, her hand struck my cheek with a sharp crack. Heat blossomed instantly across my skin, humiliation burning hotter than the sting.

The hallway fell silent, onlookers freezing in shock. And then‚Äîher performance shifted.

Lavinia exhaled sharply, her hand flying to her stomach.

Her face twisted, pale now instead of triumphant. ‚ÄúTrevor!‚Äù she cried, her voice breaking into a sob. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs stressing me‚Äîmy tummy‚Äôs rumbling weird. I guess‚Ä¶something‚Äôs wrong‚Äî‚Äù

Her knees buckled, her body folding slightly as if the very weight of her cruelty had turned on her.

Trevor had just emerged from the courtroom, his gaze snapping to the sight of Lavinia clinging to the marble column, trembling.

For a split second, I thought it was another act. A manipulative ploy. But then‚Äî

The dark bloom of blood appeared, staining the pale fabric of her skirt. Murmurs erupted through the hallway.

‚ÄúTrevor!‚Äù Lavinia‚Äôs voice cracked into a scream. ‚ÄúHelp me‚Äîplease‚Äî‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat. Even in her cruelty, even in her victory, she was still carrying his child.

Trevor‚Äôs composure shattered. His face drained of color as he rushed toward her, catching her before she collapsed fully.

Around us, chaos erupted‚Äîshouts for help, hurried footsteps, the echo of someone calling for an ambulance.

‚ÄúIf something happens to her and the baby, I swear, I'll never forgive you, Erin!‚Äù Trevor hissed as he boarded into the ambulance.

Chapter 6: Departure and Goodbye

The flashing lights of cameras still haunted me even hours later. Every headline had my name carved into it like a warning label‚ÄîHomewrecker. Jealous First Wife. Bitter Ex.

And Lavinia knew exactly how to play the part at the press conference. She held her baby bump like it was some fragile crown. She spoke through her tears with the poise of someone trained in manipulation.

‚ÄúShe bullied me,‚Äù she told the sea of microphones. ‚ÄúErin never accepted me, never accepted that Trevor‚Äôs heart was mine. I‚Äôm carrying his child, yet she made me feel unsafe‚Äîunwanted‚Äîjust because I was his first love.‚Äù

First love. The words sliced deeper than I wanted to admit. Rage bait, exactly what the world craved. The audience burst out, social media flared alive, and by sundown, I was trending. Not because of who I was, but because of who I was painted to be.

I didn‚Äôt fight back.

The court had already granted the divorce. Legally, I was no one to Trevor anymore. And now, publicly, I was a villainess who dared to exist in the shadow of his mistress-turned-wife. So then, I booked my flight that night.

A one-way ticket.

No return.

No hesitation.

The airport was hushed at dawn. I wheeled my small luggage, wearing oversized sunglasses to shield my swollen eyes. I clutched the passport and boarding pass as though it was the last rope keeping me sane. Henry had begged me to stay, to fight. But I couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore. I was done being a punching bag for both Trevor‚Äôs betrayal and Lavinia‚Äôs cruelty.

I moved quietly, ignoring the stares from strangers who perhaps recognized me from the news.

When I reached the waiting area, my phone buzzed continuously with simultaneous messages.

Trevor: Where are you?

Trevor: Erin, answer me.

Trevor: For once, do the right thing. Apologize to Lavinia publicly. Make this right!

My chest ached, not from longing, but from the finality of it. He wanted me to bend my knees once more to the woman who stole everything.

I stared at the screen until my reflection blurred. Then I powered it off, walked to the nearest trash bin, and dropped it inside without a second thought.

But the SIM card‚ÄîI slipped it out, pressing it between my fingers. When the plane ascended, I let the small chip fall from my grasp. It tumbled against the window before disappearing into nothingness, like every promise Trevor ever made me.

‚ÄúYou don't deserve my love, Trevor. I‚Äôm leaving you for good.‚Äù I whispered, wiping the tears in my eyes.

Just when I thought everything was in favor of me... the plane went on a drastic turbulence. And then came a loud crash! In a snap, everything exploded in my very eyes...

I bought a CPO 2023 330i on July 13th with 17.5k miles. It‚Äôs specced exactly how I like and I got a fantastic deal. Since then, I‚Äôve only had the car in my possession for 5 days because it‚Äôs been back at BMW service almost the whole time.

It started with some cosmetic stains inside the car. During my extended test drive I didn‚Äôt notice any mechanical issues, and the dealer told me I could bring it back later for a detail since their team had left for the day. In the few days between buying it and bringing it back in, I started noticing multiple rattles. When I dropped it off for detailing, I mentioned all of my concerns.

That‚Äôs when things snowballed. The dealership kept the car for a month. They discovered that coffee had been spilled into the center console and damaged the electronics, so they had to replace the entire MMI control unit. On top of that, they sent the car to the collision center and stripped down the back of the car to the frame to fix rattles.

When I finally got the car back, it was clean and most of the rattles were fixed, but one was still there. I brought it back later that same week. It‚Äôs now been another three and a half weeks. The last update I got was that the collision center identified the source of the problem but doesn‚Äôt know how to fix it yet and is waiting on BMW NA for guidance.

The GM has offered to unwind the deal and let me return the car given the circumstances. On one hand, I love how this car is specced and I got it for a great price. On the other hand, the stains, coffee spill, numerous rattles, certain wear and tear, and the fact that one rattle can‚Äôt be fixed so far makes me worried the car could have bigger issues down the line.

So my questions are:

Would you let them keep trying to fix it, or take the GM up on the offer to return it?

If I do return it, should I try again with another low-mileage CPO 330i (my last car was a very low mileage CPO Audi which I lemoned after just over a year over ownership), just buy a new 330i (around $54k specced how I want), or at that price point just go for a dealer gently used M340i with a few thousand miles?

I really like this car, but I‚Äôm starting to worry that if I don‚Äôt walk away now I‚Äôll be stuck with long-term headaches. Curious what you‚Äôd do in my shoes.",1,1757904416.0,BMW,4,1.0,False

* **Brush under attachments:**¬†Use a soft manual toothbrush to gently brush around the attachments on your teeth, not just the trays. 6/10
* **Storage:**¬†Storing trays in water (rather than a dry case) made the biofilm easier to clean and stopped the smell from getting worse. 7/10
* **Dial antibacterial soap:**¬†I cleaned my trays with Dial antibacterial hand soap (wish I did unscented antibacterial soap). 9/10 use soft bristles
* **15-minute hydrogen peroxide soak:**¬†Works 100% to kill smell, but damaged my retained over a long period of time. I kept doing this even though it damaged retainer a litter. the only thing that worked 100%. 10/10
* **Efferdent tablets:**¬†Did a decent job; 90% of the smell was gone, but a bit still lingered. They‚Äôre better than nothing if you want quick freshness. 6/10
* **Flossing:**¬†Real floss daily (not just a Waterpik!) made a difference over time. 8/10
* **NO toothpaste, baking soda, or hard bristles:**¬†I ruined a tray using these. They scratch the plastic. 0/10
* **UV light & ultrasonic cleaner:**¬†Cheap UV cleaner off Amazon + ultrasonic may help. Not a gimmick. 8.5/10
* **Brush your tongue:**¬†did it more but not sure if it helped.  ?/10
* **Hydrate:**¬†Drinking plenty of water helped. A dry mouth definitely makes smells worse. ?/10
* **Rinse after coffee and food:**¬†did it but not sure if it helped. ?/10
* **Baking soda:**¬†Removes smell, but damaged my tray ‚Äî so avoid it. 0/10
* **Salt water soak:**¬†Didn‚Äôt do anything for me (tried it, no effect). 0/10
* **Mouthwash and hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse**. Did not work bad taste in mouth. 1/10

Going forwards I am going to confirm with an ent or periodontist to ensure I dont have tonsil infection or similar. that may be the source of the smell. Right now I use dial antibacterial soap and hydrogen peroxide only. Making sure to floss often but gently. This has made me able to live with it and solve 95% of the issue. Sometimes the smell still comes up but I can wear it more often.

In 1994, Katie Walters, the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn‚Äôt enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett ‚ÄúScottie‚Äù Parker, but then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie‚Äôs conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that‚Äôs when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scott, after Scottie, who is 16 going on 30. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie‚Äôs new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scott are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scott, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scott comes home, and sees them kiss. Scott snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scott go dress shopping for Scott‚Äôs homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scott arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie‚Äôs bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie‚Äôs arms. Scott then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn‚Äôt know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scott.

1nha43f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1nha43f/i_was_his_pregnant_blood_bag/,I Was His Pregnant Blood Bag,"Chapter 1  
  
Three years of marriage to Grant Caldwell, and I'm finally pregnant.  
  
But he just denied my maternity leave. He expects me to keep working‚Äîright up until the day I give birth.  
  
I used to think it was because he was worried. That he was afraid something might happen if I were home alone, and he wouldn't make it back in time.  
  
Then his secretary, Star Jones, got hurt. Badly. Bleeding everywhere.  
  
They dragged me in to donate blood.  
  
That's when I heard the doctor say it‚Äîvoice dripping with envy: ""Ms. Jones, Mr. Caldwell truly treasures you. You have a clotting disorder and a rare blood type. He keeps a mobile blood bank ready, just for you.""  
  
My heart turned to dust.  
  
Suddenly, it all made sense.  
  
Why I was rejected after my initial interview at Caldwell Corp‚Ä¶ only to get a callback because of my blood work.  
  
Why my leave request was denied.  
  
It was never about protecting me.  
  
It was because I have that same rare blood type.  
  
I gave up. I left the city. I walked away.  
  
But not before I saw Star's smug expression.  
  
""Grant is so overprotective,"" she purred. ""He won't even let me pour my own water. I'm not that fragile‚ÄîI can protect myself for him. I don't need a blood bank.""  
  
Grant's face was tense, but his voice shook with fear. ""Don't talk like that. It's Susan Miller's honor to be your blood bank. You're infinitely more important than someone like her. Seeing you bleed‚Ä¶ I almost lost my mind. Thank God you're okay.""  
  
He held her gently, trembling like he was cradling something priceless.  
  
Then Star laughed lightly. ""Lowly? She's carrying your child, isn't she?""  
  
Grant buried his face in her shoulder. ""If I hadn't bet that her child would have the same rare blood type‚Ä¶ you think I'd let someone like her carry my child?""  
  
Star laughed again‚Äîbright and cruel.  
  
And I stood there, outside the door, my world crumbling.  
  
I'm pregnant. And they just took eight hundred milliliters of my blood. I nearly passed out.  
  
Not a word of concern from Grant.  
  
Not even a look.  
  
In the end, it was a nurse who took pity on me and helped me to another room.  
  
Three years ago, Grant swept into my life like a storm of affection.  
  
He paid off my father's gambling debts.  
  
On the anniversary of my mother's death, he promised her he'd take care of me forever.  
  
I really thought I'd found my soulmate.  
  
Turns out I was just a lamb raised for slaughter.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
He slipped out of the room, pulling the door shut without a sound.  
  
When he turned, he found me waiting on the bench in the hallway, my eyes fixed on him.  
  
""Susan,"" he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. ""What are you doing out here?""  
  
He came closer and knelt down, his movements calm and deliberate. His hand wrapped around mine‚Äîmy skin was cold, his touch warm.  
  
I blinked slowly. ""How's Ms. Jones?"" I asked, trying to sound indifferent.  
  
Just the mention of her name softened his expression. ""Star's sleeping. But you‚Äîyou look pale. You should go get some rest.""  
  
I almost laughed. He noticed I looked pale? Now?  
  
""I'm fine,"" I said flatly. ""Ms. Jones is the one who matters.""  
  
My tone must have given me away. Grant thought I was being jealous. Without another word, he pulled me to my feet and guided me firmly toward the elevator.  
  
""I'll stay with Star. The driver will take you home.""  
  
Tears stung my eyes. Without thinking, I brought a hand to my stomach.  
  
He saw the gesture. I know he did. But he said nothing.  
  
My heart felt twisted, heavy‚Äîlike it was collapsing inside my chest.  
  
When I got home, the emptiness hit me right away.  
  
The house was too big, too quiet. Just Grant and me. No one else.  
  
I remembered once, months ago, when I'd just finished cleaning the whole place. I was tired, my back sore. He was working at the table, not looking up.  
  
""You're the CEO of Caldwell Corp,"" I'd joked, ""and you don't even have a housekeeper? Nobody's gonna believe that.""  
  
His reply was calm, detached. ""I don't like strangers in the house. You're my limit.""  
  
I stood there, frozen. The vacuum cleaner slipped from my hand and hit the floor with a dull thud.  
  
He must have realized how that sounded. He quickly added, ""What I mean is, no housekeeper could ever be as efficient as my wife. Besides‚Äîstrangers would ruin our privacy.""  
  
Back then, his words wrapped around me like a warm lie. I believed him. I thought it meant I was special.  
  
Now I know better. I was just naive.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
His phone sat dark on the coffee table, silent and still.  
  
Moonlight washed over my face, pale and lonely in the empty living room.  
  
I wiped my tears and forced myself toward the kitchen. My body felt heavy, drained. There's a tiny blood bank growing in my belly‚ÄîI knew I should eat. Grant wouldn't want his so-called ""blood bank"" to go hungry, after all.  
  
I choked down a bowl of plain noodles.  
  
Then I opened my phone. The first thing that flashed across the screen was a new post from Star Jones.  
  
To celebrate her discharge from the hospital, Grant had taken her to the most expensive restaurant in the city‚ÄîThe Imperial House. The bill for that single meal was probably more than I make in a year.  
  
But it wasn't the money that stung. It was the way he looked at her.  
  
The video was taken by someone else. There was Star, leaning into Grant's shoulder. He had his sleeves rolled up, serving her, feeding her bites of food. So tender. So caring. A kind of affection he never showed his own wife.  
  
I let out a bitter laugh and turned off my phone. The darkness swallowed me again.  
  
I stumbled upstairs‚Äîto Grant's studio.  
  
It was his sacred space. Off-limits to me. I always imagined it was filled with valuable things.  
  
Turns out, it was.  
  
The walls were covered with thousands of portraits of Star Jones. And the lock code? Her birthday.  
  
It opened on the second try.  
  
I wandered through the room. Grant had known Star since her school days. His early sketches were rough, unpolished, but full of feeling. As the years went by, his technique improved‚Äîbut the subject never changed.  
  
Dozens of pink envelopes were piled near his easel. I opened one. Out poured Grant's desperate, passionate love. His words were so intense they brought fresh tears to my eyes. Every sentence was an ode to Star.  
  
I sank to the floor and read them all. One after another. After a while, my tears ran dry. But my heart‚Äîit felt torn open. Raw.  
  
By the time I finished, the sun was beginning to rise.  
  
I cleaned everything up, locked the door behind me, and scheduled an abortion for the following week.  
  
Once the baby is gone‚Ä¶ so are we.  
  
  
  
Chapter 4  
  
Grant looked exhausted as he came in. ""Susan, who were you talking to?""  
  
I rubbed my tired eyes. ""You're hearing things.""  
  
He changed his shoes and pulled me into a hug. ""What's going on? Are you mad I wasn't here?""  
  
""No,"" I said, pushing him away calmly.  
  
He frowned but kept his voice soft. ""Come on, don't be like that. I heard you on the phone with a doctor. Is the baby okay?""  
  
He knelt and put a hand on my stomach, leaning close. ""Hey little one, are you giving your mom a hard time? We should go to the hospital. You're Daddy's little angel‚ÄîI need you to be okay.""  
  
The performance turned my stomach. He wasn't worried about me or the baby‚Äîhe was worried about losing Star's personal blood supply.  
  
""It's fine. I just need to lie down.""  
  
I pulled away and went to the bedroom.  
  
Grant watched me for a minute before leaving, apparently satisfied I wasn't in crisis.  
  
Later, he came back and sat by the bed, chatting about prenatal vitamins and doctor's visits. I smiled and nodded along. If I didn't know the truth, I might have believed he actually cared.  
  
When he thought I'd fallen asleep, he finally left. I stared at the ceiling, wide awake.  
  
He didn't come back until lunch.  
  
""Still sleeping, sleepyhead?"" he murmured before kissing my lips. ""Lunch is ready.""  
  
I pretended to stir and followed him out.  
  
But my appetite vanished the moment I saw Star sitting at the dining table. A wave of nausea hit me. I turned to leave, but Grant caught my wrist.  
  
""Susan, what's wrong?"" He frowned, glancing between me and Star.  
  
Before I could answer, Star chirped, ""Susan! You're up! I ordered your favorite nutrient meals from Imperial House‚Äîto thank you for the blood donation.""  
  
I pulled my hand free and walked slowly to the table. The spread was full of spicy food.  
  
""How thoughtful, Ms. Jones,"" I said flatly. ""You know I can't eat spicy food while pregnant, yet you ordered Sichuan.""  
  
Star's face fell instantly. Grant rushed to her side. ""Star, I'm so sorry. I was trying to accommodate Susan's tastes. You know I never eat spicy either.""  
  
Star began to cry. Grant's eyes got watery too. He spent the next several minutes comforting her while I stood there, forgotten.  
  
When her sobs finally quieted, Grant turned on me, eyes blazing. ""Susan Miller‚Äîapologize.""  
  
I clenched my fists. ""This is insane. I didn't say anything wrong. Why should I apologize?""  
  
Star burst into fresh tears. Grant couldn't take it. He slapped me‚Äîhard.  
  
I stumbled back, my back slamming into the table. My ears rang.  
  
""You brought this on yourself,"" he said coldly.  
  
From the shelter of Grant's arms, Star shot me a look of pure triumph.  
  
I stood frozen as Grant lifted her into his arms and brushed past me without another glance.  
  
Three years of love‚Äîgone, just like that.

For three whole years, I pretended to be Ethan Parker's girlfriend‚Äîonly to realize, too late, that I'd actually fallen for him.  
  
Just as I was working up the nerve to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard Brittany‚Äîthe girl who'd always had it out for me‚Äîtalking to him.  
  
""Thanks for faking amnesia to help me get back at Olivia,"" she said. ""One hundred pranks, and I'll go out with you.""  
  
My whole world came crashing down.  
  
I was nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game to win over Brittany‚Äîhis unrequited crush.  
  
So I died in a staged plane crash.  
  
Ethan searched the wreckage like a madman until he found a single ring, engraved with the words: ""Prank 100: I bet you love me.""  
  
They say he cried until he passed out and woke up in the hospital consumed with rage toward everyone involved in the pranks.  
  
Meanwhile, I stood in the French Alps, burning my fake death certificate, a faint smile touching my lips.  
  
He faked amnesia to break my heart. I faked my death to break his.  
  
Brittany's voice, sickly sweet, drifted through the wall. ""Ethan, prank 96‚Äîsuccess!""  
  
Ethan's reply was cold, unfamiliar. ""Having fun, Brittany?""  
  
""Getting back at Olivia for stealing your scholarship and that game design award. Duh,"" one of his buddies chimed in.  
  
""Just four more, Brittany, and Ethan's all yours!"" another voice shouted.  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
""Ethan's a genius. Who would've thought of faking amnesia just to mess with Olivia?""  
  
""That time we made her search for her bracelet in the pouring rain‚Ä¶ priceless! And then he gave it to Brittany!""  
  
My mom's jade bracelet. The one she gave me on her deathbed. The one Ethan ""lost"" when he moved. I'd searched for seven hours in a downpour and ended up with a 104-degree fever.  
  
""And remember her thesis defense? Ethan told her he got jumped at a bar.""  
  
They roared with laughter. ""She ran to the bar, found nothing, and ended up begging her professor not to fail her! We got it all on video.""  
  
I bit my lip until I tasted blood.  
  
I'd missed my thesis defense‚Äîa project I'd poured six months into‚Äîfor nothing. I had to postpone graduation because of it.  
  
Brittany giggled. ""And that time he folded her game design‚Äîthe one she'd slaved over for three nights straight‚Äîinto a paper airplane. She was like a stray dog, picking up the pieces all night.""  
  
""So what's the plan for this one?"" Ethan asked.  
  
""Tell her you're in the hospital. Tell her to rush over. Then we all go party and leave her hanging!""  
  
My phone buzzed. A message from Ethan: ""City Hospital, ER. Come quickly.""  
  
I slipped away before anyone noticed.  
  
Two minutes later, he retracted the message. A pang of guilt, maybe?  
  
I played along like I'd never seen it.  
  
I already knew the truth.  
  
I'd stumbled upon a hidden folder on his phone labeled ""Game Progress,"" filled with 96 videos‚Äîone for each cruel prank.  
  
The password? Brittany's birthday: 12/24.  
  
The same day he claimed he first met me.  
  
The same Christmas Eve I waited for him in the snow for three hours while he was at Brittany's birthday party, placing a crown on her head.  
  
That night, he'd wrapped a scarf around my neck‚Äîso tender, so caring.  
  
A wave of nausea hit me. I opened his meticulously kept chat log with Brittany.  
  
""Told her I was working late. Took you to Disneyland. She waited until 3 am.""  
  
""Told her her competition time was two hours later. She ran out in her pajamas. Hilarious!""  
  
The last entry was from the night of our class reunion. Brittany had ""accidentally"" spilled scalding coffee on me. Ethan shielded me instantly.  
  
But the chat log read: ""Disgusted even to touch her. Used three bottles of sanitizer.""  
  
I called my dad. Told him I wanted to join him in Paris.  
  
He'd moved there five years ago, after Mom died. He'd always wanted me to come, to study abroad. I'd refused. I stayed for Ethan.  
  
I thought I could melt his icy heart. I forgot that melted ice leaves only bone-chilling cold.  
  
""My sweet girl,"" Dad said, his voice full of relief. ""You finally figured it out.""  
  
""Yeah,"" I choked out, tears welling.  
  
""Dad,"" I said, ""when I leave, I need you to stage a plane crash.""  
  
He didn't understand, but he agreed.  
  
A plane crash. My final gift to Ethan Parker.  
  
I deleted every photo of us. While packing, a leather-bound journal slipped out from Ethan's safe. Embossed on the cover was the phoenix logo from my game, Ashes of the Realm‚Äîthe initial design I'd spent 36 sleepless nights perfecting.  
  
Ethan had printed it. The book was filled with my design drafts, meticulously collected, with notes wishing me success.  
  
Page seven held a photo of me, glasses perched on my nose, deep in code. A sticky note beside it read: ""She called the developers 'frazzled cats' today. Her revised plan is ten times better. Such an adorable genius.""  
  
He'd been there those nights I pulled all-nighters‚Äîmassaging my shoulders, cooking me ramen. He'd run out at 3 am for cake just because I'd mentioned craving it. He remembered my period, always ready with hot ginger tea and heating pads.  
  
This ""love prank""? He was falling for it, too.  
  
The last page held a crumpled plane ticket stub from last Valentine's Day. His handwriting filled the margins: ""If I had to choose again, I'd still pretend to lose this ticket, trick her into staying up all night with me to revise the proposal. Brittany wanted this. Prank 72.""  
  
Rain lashed against the window. All that love, built on a lie. He might have cared, but he cared more for Brittany. I was just a tool.  
  
I scheduled an abortion.  
  
That night, Ethan came home smelling like winter. I pretended to sleep.  
  
He paused. I hadn't reacted to the prank. He must've lost face in front of Brittany and his friends. Why wasn't he pushing it?  
  
The mattress dipped. Strong arms wrapped around me.  
  
He nuzzled his face against my neck, his breath warm on my skin. ""We're having a baby, Livvy Moon.""  
  
Livvy Moon. His nickname for me. Like the moon, shining only for him. Close to my real name, Olivia. But I knew he called me ""pretentious"" behind my back. Livvy Moon was a joke. Another way to make a fool of me.  
  
I stayed silent. He didn't know about the abortion.  
  
He pulled out my pregnancy test‚Äîthree little hearts drawn on it in pen. My pen. The Montblanc I'd bought him with my first paycheck. The one he carried.  
  
I didn't respond. He hugged me tighter, whispering sweet nothings. My heart stayed frozen.  
  
""I'm tired. Let's sleep.""  
  
He went quiet, obedient. ""Tomorrow, we're going to Brittany's birthday party,"" he murmured before drifting off.  
  
I lay awake all night.  
  
He built a game of amnesia; I gave him three years of my heart.  
  
I'd stage a death, and he'd spend the rest of his life regretting it.  
  
At the party, Ethan's friends surrounded me, shoving the biggest slice of cake in my face.  
  
""Ethan says he loves watching you eat sweets.""  
  
Ethan looked away, feigning disinterest.  
  
The cake tasted bitter. My stomach churned.  
  
Brittany pushed the cake closer. ""Olivia, don't be rude. It's my birthday! Unless‚Ä¶ you're nauseated by me?""  
  
A sharp pain ripped through my abdomen.  
  
They laughed, reveling in my discomfort.  
  
I stumbled to the bathroom, violently ill. Their laughter echoed through the door. Another successful prank.  
  
""Still have that stomach bug?"" Ethan offered me a glass of water with mint leaves‚Äîan old remedy he'd taught me when we first met.  
  
I couldn't answer. The pain intensified‚Äîneedles stabbing my insides.  
  
I looked down. Blood. So much blood.  
  
""Take me to the hospital,"" I whispered, clutching his arm.  
  
Brittany blocked the door, giggling. ""It's just spotting. Totally normal. Don't overreact, Ethan.""  
  
""Get out of the way!"" Ethan roared.  
  
The first time he'd ever challenged her.  
  
I woke up to Brittany's whiny voice outside the room. ""Too much of the‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ stuff? Wasn't it just supposed to be embarrassing?""  
  
One of the guys laughed. ""Getting rid of that little bastard's a bonus. Ethan should be thanking us.""  
  
""Yeah. Three years is enough. What if she'd kept it? How would he ditch her then?""  
  
Ethan's voice, low and strained. ""Pranks are pranks. You don't mess with her health.""  
  
Brittany's voice turned shocked, then angry. ""Who was it that said he'd help me 'teach that nerd a lesson'? Who wanted to humiliate her as my birthday gift? Don't tell me you've fallen for her.""  
  
A long silence. Then, ""Never. You know I love you.""  
  
Laughter erupted again.  
  
Prank 98: Complete. They were already plotting number 99.  
  
I touched my now-flat stomach. The dull ache lingered. We were just part of their sick game‚Äîa birthday present for Brittany.  
  
I cancelled the abortion. There was no need.  
  
The baby's father had already made the decision.  
  
I was about to call my dad when Ethan walked in. I feigned sleep.  
  
His voice, thick with guilt, brushed against my ear. ""Olivia, I'm so sorry‚Ä¶""  
  
The reason went unspoken.  
  
When I was discharged, Ethan said his friends and Brittany wanted to apologize. They invited me to hike up Cheaha Mountain. There was a temple at the top, a place to pray for our lost child.  
  
I knew it was probably another prank. But the thought of the baby‚Ä¶  
  
This would be my goodbye.  
  
They fawned over Brittany, ignoring me.  
  
At the prayer tree, Ethan bought a wooden plaque for us to write the baby's name together.  
  
Brittany smiled sweetly. ""You're such a good mom, Olivia.""  
  
I ignored her fake sympathy.  
  
The tree was crowded. I had to lean over the railing to hang the plaque. Someone shoved me hard from behind.  
  
""Aaah!""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
A sudden, violent force ripped through me. My leg... I couldn't move.  
  
Everything went black.  
  
Then, Ethan's arms were around me, lifting me up. His eyes were red and swollen.  
  
""Livvy Moon, don't worry. I'll get you to a hospital.""  
  
""Why?"" I whispered, my vision swimming with tears. ""Why are you doing this to me?""  
  
The wound was on the outside, but my heart was the one that felt completely shattered.  
  
His voice shook. ""I didn't know they'd do that, Olivia. I swear‚Ä¶""  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up with my leg trapped in a heavy plaster cast. The doctor said the damage might be permanent. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks.  
  
Ethan was right there beside me, his face etched with deep worry. He drew a tiny moon on the cast. ""Livvy Moon,"" he whispered. ""I'll be here until you're better.""  
  
I closed my eyes, and he gently tucked the blanket around me, moving as if I were made of the most fragile glass. He fussed over me, fetching anything I could possibly need, running back and forth for almost an hour before he finally settled into his chair.  
  
The perfect, attentive boyfriend.  
  
The one who had orchestrated my downfall.  
  
I pretended to sleep, my heart hammering out a painful, frantic rhythm. Ethan stayed up the entire night, keeping watch over me.  
  
He kept kissing that little moon on my cast, his own tears flowing freely. He held my hand so tight, as if he were afraid I might vanish.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Livvy Moon. It's all my fault. I should've never listened to them. I should've never hurt you.""  
  
""I'm glad I still have a chance. I won't ever hurt you again. You're my everything, Livvy Moon.""  
  
""I almost lost you. I'm so sorry.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He watched me all night, and I could feel the weight of his gaze. He was in pain because I was hurt‚Äîhe'd even told them not to mess with my health.  
  
For a second, I almost let my guard down. Almost. Then it hit me‚Äîhow delusional I was being.  
  
Ethan's true loyalty? It always went back to Brittany.  
  
Prank 99. I was still just a pawn in their twisted game. He let it happen. Again.  
  
What's stopping him from being part of Prank 100?  
  
While he was out grabbing breakfast, I called my dad. The bodyguards were already on their way. It was time to put the ""plane crash"" plan into motion.  
  
Then Brittany showed up. Smug. Gloating.  
  
""Olivia, breaking your leg? That was my idea. Prank 99.""  
  
I stared back, my breath catching in my throat.  
  
She looked me over, adjusting her designer shawl like she owned the room.  
  
""Prank 100? The Realm competition. You're going down for plagiarism. Ethan handed over all your Ashes of the Realm levels. He even bribed the committee. Your submission will be timestamped three minutes after mine. Get ready for public humiliation.""  
  
Realm. The biggest game design competition in the country. Two years of my life‚Äîall those levels, saved on my laptop.  
  
I slapped her. Hard. ""Stealing my work. Chasing after my boyfriend. You'll always be a second-rate version of yourself, Brittany.""  
  
Her eyes turned sharp. She grabbed my wrist, hand raised to hit back. ""You're the one settling for secondhand things now!""  
  
But the slap never came.  
  
""Brittany, what the hell are you doing?"" Ethan stood in the doorway‚Äîmy dad's bodyguards right behind him.

1nh9ywf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nh9ywf/struggling_with_gaming_conflict_in_my_marriage/,Struggling with gaming conflict in my marriage,"Hi everyone, first time posting here.

I‚Äôm 29, my wife is 36, and we run a business together. We've been together for 7 years and married for 2 years. When we first got together, we both worked extremely hard to get our business off the ground. Now things are stable, we make our own schedules, client work is always handled on time, and we‚Äôve built a lifestyle that includes a lot of travel and free time.

I‚Äôve always been a gamer. Early in our relationship (when I was about 25), I did fall into some unhealthy habits ‚Äî gaming 3‚Äì4 hours every single day. Since then, I‚Äôve made big changes, but the topic has continued to come up on and off over the past 4 years.

Recently, after we spent a month traveling around resorts in Canada, I logged back in to play with some friends. That‚Äôs when things escalated again. A few days ago, she walked into my office while I was working and saw a game open in the background. She assumed I‚Äôd been gaming all day, and since then we‚Äôve been fighting. Now she says I need to quit gaming completely or she‚Äôll leave.

For context, our life together is very active and connected:

We spend about 3 hours every morning walking the dogs and having coffee together.

We both work during the day.

In the afternoons we either go to the gym for 1.5 hours or go mountain biking for 2‚Äì4 hours.

We also travel about 2-4 months a year.


In my downtime, I like to game. Typically, I‚Äôll be logged in (not always actively playing) for around 3 hours a day, and once a week I‚Äôd play with friends for 5‚Äì8 hours. I suggested cutting it down to just Saturdays, but she feels that any gaming is childish. She‚Äôs also said my gaming was responsible for any past businesses that failed, which I don‚Äôt believe is true.

I‚Äôm not ignoring responsibilities, and I feel like I‚Äôve been trying to compromise, but clearly this has become a major sticking point.

So my question is: how do we move forward? Is this about gaming itself, or is it a deeper compatibility issue in how we view free time and responsibility?

We are in a friend group with 3 others (21F, 22F, and 22M). Two weeks ago, B and the other guy decided they wanted to have a movie night and watch The Emoji Movie. The girls weren't super enthusiastic, but B convinced us to come by luring us with fresh-baked brownies. It takes me and the other 2 girls \~30 minutes to get to his apartment, including a 15-minute walk entirely uphill in 80-degree heat. Upon arrival, he does not have the brownies as promised. The Emoji Movie was $3.49 and he hadn't rented it yet. 

Maybe 5 minutes after we sat down, he asked all the girls to Venmo him $1 each if we wanted to watch The Emoji Movie, or we could watch some weird and very horribly-animated Christian movie with 4 reviews for free. At first, we did not think his request for $1 from each of the women was genuine, and we were kind of shocked and side-eyeing. But it became clear that he was actually requesting that we all Venmo him $1 or we would be subjected to that weird movie. Upon receiving all $3, he purchased the movie (that we really didn't want to watch anyway) and we watched it through. At no point in the movie did he have any brownies out (literally the whole reason I came, which I stated when responding to his text invite), and instead gave all the girls one bag of microwave popcorn to share, while he and the other guy drank some beer that they did not offer to us. We watched the movie and then began our trek home. 

All 3 of us girls are annoyed because we were lured with brownies that we did not get, and had to venmo a man ($1!!) for a stupid movie he wanted to watch, while the only other man there was not asked to pay (because he brought a snack that the two of them shared), all after making a long and strenuous commute to his apartment. 

We had also previously hosted him at our apartment (me and 21F are roomates) and provided alcohol and snacks, which he enjoyed, and we did not expect, request, or recieve any money from him in exchange. He also goes out regularly and buys coffee every day, so I do not think he is financially struggling. 

Am I the asshole for being annoyed at him? Would I be the asshole if I gave him a hard time for this tomorrow? Or ended our friendship over this? All 3 of the girls are very offended.

For three whole years, I pretended to be Ethan Parker's girlfriend‚Äîonly to realize, too late, that I'd actually fallen for him.  
  
Just as I was working up the nerve to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard Brittany‚Äîthe girl who'd always had it out for me‚Äîtalking to him.  
  
""Thanks for faking amnesia to help me get back at Olivia,"" she said. ""One hundred pranks, and I'll go out with you.""  
  
My whole world came crashing down.  
  
I was nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game to win over Brittany‚Äîhis unrequited crush.  
  
So I died in a staged plane crash.  
  
Ethan searched the wreckage like a madman until he found a single ring, engraved with the words: ""Prank 100: I bet you love me.""  
  
They say he cried until he passed out and woke up in the hospital consumed with rage toward everyone involved in the pranks.  
  
Meanwhile, I stood in the French Alps, burning my fake death certificate, a faint smile touching my lips.  
  
He faked amnesia to break my heart. I faked my death to break his.  
  
Brittany's voice, sickly sweet, drifted through the wall. ""Ethan, prank 96‚Äîsuccess!""  
  
Ethan's reply was cold, unfamiliar. ""Having fun, Brittany?""  
  
""Getting back at Olivia for stealing your scholarship and that game design award. Duh,"" one of his buddies chimed in.  
  
""Just four more, Brittany, and Ethan's all yours!"" another voice shouted.  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
""Ethan's a genius. Who would've thought of faking amnesia just to mess with Olivia?""  
  
""That time we made her search for her bracelet in the pouring rain‚Ä¶ priceless! And then he gave it to Brittany!""  
  
My mom's jade bracelet. The one she gave me on her deathbed. The one Ethan ""lost"" when he moved. I'd searched for seven hours in a downpour and ended up with a 104-degree fever.  
  
""And remember her thesis defense? Ethan told her he got jumped at a bar.""  
  
They roared with laughter. ""She ran to the bar, found nothing, and ended up begging her professor not to fail her! We got it all on video.""  
  
I bit my lip until I tasted blood.  
  
I'd missed my thesis defense‚Äîa project I'd poured six months into‚Äîfor nothing. I had to postpone graduation because of it.  
  
Brittany giggled. ""And that time he folded her game design‚Äîthe one she'd slaved over for three nights straight‚Äîinto a paper airplane. She was like a stray dog, picking up the pieces all night.""  
  
""So what's the plan for this one?"" Ethan asked.  
  
""Tell her you're in the hospital. Tell her to rush over. Then we all go party and leave her hanging!""  
  
My phone buzzed. A message from Ethan: ""City Hospital, ER. Come quickly.""  
  
I slipped away before anyone noticed.  
  
Two minutes later, he retracted the message. A pang of guilt, maybe?  
  
I played along like I'd never seen it.  
  
I already knew the truth.  
  
I'd stumbled upon a hidden folder on his phone labeled ""Game Progress,"" filled with 96 videos‚Äîone for each cruel prank.  
  
The password? Brittany's birthday: 12/24.  
  
The same day he claimed he first met me.  
  
The same Christmas Eve I waited for him in the snow for three hours while he was at Brittany's birthday party, placing a crown on her head.  
  
That night, he'd wrapped a scarf around my neck‚Äîso tender, so caring.  
  
A wave of nausea hit me. I opened his meticulously kept chat log with Brittany.  
  
""Told her I was working late. Took you to Disneyland. She waited until 3 am.""  
  
""Told her her competition time was two hours later. She ran out in her pajamas. Hilarious!""  
  
The last entry was from the night of our class reunion. Brittany had ""accidentally"" spilled scalding coffee on me. Ethan shielded me instantly.  
  
But the chat log read: ""Disgusted even to touch her. Used three bottles of sanitizer.""  
  
I called my dad. Told him I wanted to join him in Paris.  
  
He'd moved there five years ago, after Mom died. He'd always wanted me to come, to study abroad. I'd refused. I stayed for Ethan.  
  
I thought I could melt his icy heart. I forgot that melted ice leaves only bone-chilling cold.  
  
""My sweet girl,"" Dad said, his voice full of relief. ""You finally figured it out.""  
  
""Yeah,"" I choked out, tears welling.  
  
""Dad,"" I said, ""when I leave, I need you to stage a plane crash.""  
  
He didn't understand, but he agreed.  
  
A plane crash. My final gift to Ethan Parker.  
  
I deleted every photo of us. While packing, a leather-bound journal slipped out from Ethan's safe. Embossed on the cover was the phoenix logo from my game, Ashes of the Realm‚Äîthe initial design I'd spent 36 sleepless nights perfecting.  
  
Ethan had printed it. The book was filled with my design drafts, meticulously collected, with notes wishing me success.  
  
Page seven held a photo of me, glasses perched on my nose, deep in code. A sticky note beside it read: ""She called the developers 'frazzled cats' today. Her revised plan is ten times better. Such an adorable genius.""  
  
He'd been there those nights I pulled all-nighters‚Äîmassaging my shoulders, cooking me ramen. He'd run out at 3 am for cake just because I'd mentioned craving it. He remembered my period, always ready with hot ginger tea and heating pads.  
  
This ""love prank""? He was falling for it, too.  
  
The last page held a crumpled plane ticket stub from last Valentine's Day. His handwriting filled the margins: ""If I had to choose again, I'd still pretend to lose this ticket, trick her into staying up all night with me to revise the proposal. Brittany wanted this. Prank 72.""  
  
Rain lashed against the window. All that love, built on a lie. He might have cared, but he cared more for Brittany. I was just a tool.  
  
I scheduled an abortion.  
  
That night, Ethan came home smelling like winter. I pretended to sleep.  
  
He paused. I hadn't reacted to the prank. He must've lost face in front of Brittany and his friends. Why wasn't he pushing it?  
  
The mattress dipped. Strong arms wrapped around me.  
  
He nuzzled his face against my neck, his breath warm on my skin. ""We're having a baby, Livvy Moon.""  
  
Livvy Moon. His nickname for me. Like the moon, shining only for him. Close to my real name, Olivia. But I knew he called me ""pretentious"" behind my back. Livvy Moon was a joke. Another way to make a fool of me.  
  
I stayed silent. He didn't know about the abortion.  
  
He pulled out my pregnancy test‚Äîthree little hearts drawn on it in pen. My pen. The Montblanc I'd bought him with my first paycheck. The one he carried.  
  
I didn't respond. He hugged me tighter, whispering sweet nothings. My heart stayed frozen.  
  
""I'm tired. Let's sleep.""  
  
He went quiet, obedient. ""Tomorrow, we're going to Brittany's birthday party,"" he murmured before drifting off.  
  
I lay awake all night.  
  
He built a game of amnesia; I gave him three years of my heart.  
  
I'd stage a death, and he'd spend the rest of his life regretting it.  
  
At the party, Ethan's friends surrounded me, shoving the biggest slice of cake in my face.  
  
""Ethan says he loves watching you eat sweets.""  
  
Ethan looked away, feigning disinterest.  
  
The cake tasted bitter. My stomach churned.  
  
Brittany pushed the cake closer. ""Olivia, don't be rude. It's my birthday! Unless‚Ä¶ you're nauseated by me?""  
  
A sharp pain ripped through my abdomen.  
  
They laughed, reveling in my discomfort.  
  
I stumbled to the bathroom, violently ill. Their laughter echoed through the door. Another successful prank.  
  
""Still have that stomach bug?"" Ethan offered me a glass of water with mint leaves‚Äîan old remedy he'd taught me when we first met.  
  
I couldn't answer. The pain intensified‚Äîneedles stabbing my insides.  
  
I looked down. Blood. So much blood.  
  
""Take me to the hospital,"" I whispered, clutching his arm.  
  
Brittany blocked the door, giggling. ""It's just spotting. Totally normal. Don't overreact, Ethan.""  
  
""Get out of the way!"" Ethan roared.  
  
The first time he'd ever challenged her.  
  
I woke up to Brittany's whiny voice outside the room. ""Too much of the‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ stuff? Wasn't it just supposed to be embarrassing?""  
  
One of the guys laughed. ""Getting rid of that little bastard's a bonus. Ethan should be thanking us.""  
  
""Yeah. Three years is enough. What if she'd kept it? How would he ditch her then?""  
  
Ethan's voice, low and strained. ""Pranks are pranks. You don't mess with her health.""  
  
Brittany's voice turned shocked, then angry. ""Who was it that said he'd help me 'teach that nerd a lesson'? Who wanted to humiliate her as my birthday gift? Don't tell me you've fallen for her.""  
  
A long silence. Then, ""Never. You know I love you.""  
  
Laughter erupted again.  
  
Prank 98: Complete. They were already plotting number 99.  
  
I touched my now-flat stomach. The dull ache lingered. We were just part of their sick game‚Äîa birthday present for Brittany.  
  
I cancelled the abortion. There was no need.  
  
The baby's father had already made the decision.  
  
I was about to call my dad when Ethan walked in. I feigned sleep.  
  
His voice, thick with guilt, brushed against my ear. ""Olivia, I'm so sorry‚Ä¶""  
  
The reason went unspoken.  
  
When I was discharged, Ethan said his friends and Brittany wanted to apologize. They invited me to hike up Cheaha Mountain. There was a temple at the top, a place to pray for our lost child.  
  
I knew it was probably another prank. But the thought of the baby‚Ä¶  
  
This would be my goodbye.  
  
They fawned over Brittany, ignoring me.  
  
At the prayer tree, Ethan bought a wooden plaque for us to write the baby's name together.  
  
Brittany smiled sweetly. ""You're such a good mom, Olivia.""  
  
I ignored her fake sympathy.  
  
The tree was crowded. I had to lean over the railing to hang the plaque. Someone shoved me hard from behind.  
  
""Aaah!""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
A sudden, violent force ripped through me. My leg... I couldn't move.  
  
Everything went black.  
  
Then, Ethan's arms were around me, lifting me up. His eyes were red and swollen.  
  
""Livvy Moon, don't worry. I'll get you to a hospital.""  
  
""Why?"" I whispered, my vision swimming with tears. ""Why are you doing this to me?""  
  
The wound was on the outside, but my heart was the one that felt completely shattered.  
  
His voice shook. ""I didn't know they'd do that, Olivia. I swear‚Ä¶""  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up with my leg trapped in a heavy plaster cast. The doctor said the damage might be permanent. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks.  
  
Ethan was right there beside me, his face etched with deep worry. He drew a tiny moon on the cast. ""Livvy Moon,"" he whispered. ""I'll be here until you're better.""  
  
I closed my eyes, and he gently tucked the blanket around me, moving as if I were made of the most fragile glass. He fussed over me, fetching anything I could possibly need, running back and forth for almost an hour before he finally settled into his chair.  
  
The perfect, attentive boyfriend.  
  
The one who had orchestrated my downfall.  
  
I pretended to sleep, my heart hammering out a painful, frantic rhythm. Ethan stayed up the entire night, keeping watch over me.  
  
He kept kissing that little moon on my cast, his own tears flowing freely. He held my hand so tight, as if he were afraid I might vanish.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Livvy Moon. It's all my fault. I should've never listened to them. I should've never hurt you.""  
  
""I'm glad I still have a chance. I won't ever hurt you again. You're my everything, Livvy Moon.""  
  
""I almost lost you. I'm so sorry.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He watched me all night, and I could feel the weight of his gaze. He was in pain because I was hurt‚Äîhe'd even told them not to mess with my health.  
  
For a second, I almost let my guard down. Almost. Then it hit me‚Äîhow delusional I was being.  
  
Ethan's true loyalty? It always went back to Brittany.  
  
Prank 99. I was still just a pawn in their twisted game. He let it happen. Again.  
  
What's stopping him from being part of Prank 100?  
  
While he was out grabbing breakfast, I called my dad. The bodyguards were already on their way. It was time to put the ""plane crash"" plan into motion.  
  
Then Brittany showed up. Smug. Gloating.  
  
""Olivia, breaking your leg? That was my idea. Prank 99.""  
  
I stared back, my breath catching in my throat.  
  
She looked me over, adjusting her designer shawl like she owned the room.  
  
""Prank 100? The Realm competition. You're going down for plagiarism. Ethan handed over all your Ashes of the Realm levels. He even bribed the committee. Your submission will be timestamped three minutes after mine. Get ready for public humiliation.""  
  
Realm. The biggest game design competition in the country. Two years of my life‚Äîall those levels, saved on my laptop.  
  
I slapped her. Hard. ""Stealing my work. Chasing after my boyfriend. You'll always be a second-rate version of yourself, Brittany.""  
  
Her eyes turned sharp. She grabbed my wrist, hand raised to hit back. ""You're the one settling for secondhand things now!""  
  
But the slap never came.  
  
""Brittany, what the hell are you doing?"" Ethan stood in the doorway‚Äîmy dad's bodyguards right behind him.

1nh9vel,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1nh9vel/reusing_bottles_at_12m/,Reusing bottles at 12m+?,"I solely breastfed my baby for like 6m, then I started supplementing formula only for daycare and still breastfed outside of daycare until like 10m. After that, I was breastfeeding only morning and night (until almost 12m). So really it wasn‚Äôt until after 10m that she would have back to back feedings from a bottle‚Ä¶

That being said, around 10m I had looked up how long you can keep prepared formula in the fridge and it said 24 hours so I was basically using the same bottle for 24 hours and just refilling it and putting it in the fridge between feeds. Baby is now just over 12m and we‚Äôre transitioning to whole milk (currently doing half whole milk and half formula). Because of this, I was looking up what the rules are with whole milk, come to find out (from a conversation with ChatGPT) that the 24 hour rule is for formula that the baby has not tried to drink from!

So now I‚Äôm wondering if I can keep doing what I was doing since it‚Äôs never caused a problem? Currently, I fill a bottle all the way to the top at night, once she‚Äôs done I keep whatever she didn‚Äôt finish and add more milk to it, and keep it in the fridge for her morning feeding. For weekdays it‚Äôs just those two feedings but weekends I‚Äôll use the same bottle for one more feeding during the day. Obviously my baby has never gotten sick from it and it helps with less dishes to do so I feel like it‚Äôs fine but the official regulations say not to keep it for more than an hour or two, and then when I look at other Reddit threads, they‚Äôre asking about newborns. I feel like since my baby is already pretty much a toddler, any bacteria that does form won‚Äôt bother her since she doesn‚Äôt have a sensitive stomach like a newborn does. What do you guys think???

EDIT:

Okay just wanted to say that I appreciate everyone‚Äôs responses but I‚Äôm looking for opinions about what age you think it‚Äôs okay to put an unfinished drink in the fridge for later. Like if I don‚Äôt finish a drink, I‚Äôll put it in the fridge and drink it later that day. I don‚Äôt really drink milk by itself, but I‚Äôve put coffee (with creamer) in the fridge and drank it later or Gatorade or whatever. So with the assumption that it‚Äôs completely fine for adults and teens and even kids to do this, I‚Äôm just wondering at what age it starts to be okay for toddlers? 9m? 12m? 18m?

Hello Reddit! Do you love romance ideas?Slow-burn romances? Hurt and comfort romances? Ohh, maybe a pregnancy romance idea? Well, I have ideas for all those categories! I'm not replacing any of my current partners or anything. I'm just posting the ideas floating around my head. Anyway, let's get to the important stuff! My name is Em, and I am a 22-year-old woman. I have been roleplaying for a long time. Like a very long time. I consider myself a novella-length writer. Which means I write around 500-2,000 words per post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord. I write exclusively in third person. I am an adult, so I will require that you are at least 22. I love chatting about our characters and sending TikToks or other stuff. Ohh, also the important part. I do enjoy smut, but I do a ratio of 80 percent story to 20 percent smut. That is not negotiable; I write for the joy of crafting a story, not to get off.



So to recap, here is what I'm looking for in a partner. Someone who is at least 22 years old. Someone who can match my length and writes exclusively in third person like I do. Someone who understands that these roles are not all smut. Someone who enjoys chatting and building friendships with their partners!Also, I understand you get busy, as I'm a college student and work full time, so if you are busy, just let me know! 

Also please use the password: Romance awaits. 



On to the roles! Now, I broke them up into categories to make it easier to understand. 
MMC is the male main character. 
FMC is the female main character. 




Pregnancy Plots:

1. The MMC is looking for a surrogate to help him start his family. Maybe his wife has passed, or maybe he is just tired of waiting for the one to come along. So he finds FCM through a surrogate agency and begins the journey to give him a family and much, much more.



2. MMC and FMC were a fling in college, and then they had a messy breakup. So she figured he wouldn't want anything to do with his special needs daughter. That is until they run into each other in a store years later. 



3. MMC and FMC work together. They actually despise each other. So much so that everyone in the office knows that. MMC pulls pranks on FMC just to piss her off. That is until FMC life falls apart. She was married, but then she found out her husband was cheating on her weeks after finding out she was pregnant. Her life falls apart. Little did she know the man she hated would be the one to help her put her life back together. 



Slow Burn plots:

1. FMC is a journalist, a reporter for a huge newspaper company. MMC is the famous person she is tasked with trying to get to agree to an interview. Fate has other plans, and the two end up in a love story fit for the times.  All the drama MMC has in the press is fabricated by FMC to save him. 



2. FMC is a world-class bull rider. When she is paralyzed in an accident. Her family hires FMC to help bring her out of her shell. The only problem is FMC hates MMC, but that slowly ebbs away. 



3. FCM is the queen of Scotland. The only child of the king and queen, she becomes queen after her mother's death. She is amazing at it, but to keep the country afloat, she must find a king. Her father arranges for her to marry the king of another country. Maybe Russia or England or something. FCM hates MMC with a passion. She wants to run the country because MMC cannot do it. So she spends her time planning to kill him. Unaware that MMC wants nothing to do with being king and would much rather study his hobbies. 



Hurt/comfort plots: 

1. MMC and FMC were best friends. They were inseparable until FMC was in a car accident after leaving MMC's party. He thinks he caused the accident, so he no longer speaks to her. That is until one day when he comes across her YouTube page that talks about her life and her love for him. 



2. FMC is homeless and injured, living in New York. She is barely surviving if she is being honest. Sure, she spends most of her money on drugs, but that's only because her leg doesn't hurt when she is high. One day she is trying to get a hot chocolate from a coffee shop while people grumble behind her. When it's not enough money, she just leaves. MMC watches the whole thing play out and decides he must help her. After all, he definitely has enough money to do so.



3. FMC has cystic fibrosis; she has made peace with dying. That is until she meets MMC, a vampire who now works at her job. He can't understand why she won't let him fix her. She can't understand why he cares enough to want to fix her. A beautiful love story is born. 



Enemies-to-lovers plots:


1 This one is truly an enemies-to-lovers idea. MMC is an awful person, a racist, a bigot, you name it. They are just awful.That is until they meet FMC, a woman who is everything they hate, but she isn't afraid to call him out on his wrongs. To change his mind. It's slow, it's ugly, and it's beautiful.



2. MMC and FMC families have hated each other for years. They don't really know why or understand it. Waking up one morning from a one-night stand, FMC is shocked to find MMC beside her. She vaguely remembers the night. The guy was smart, funny, and interested in her. Though she still hates him. This starts a very weird friendship with benefits that turns to more. 



3. FMC is a brutal serial killer. MMC is a cop tasked with getting FMC to help them catch a copycat killer. The two can barely stand each other, though in the hatred something else blooms.






Sample of my writing: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.
