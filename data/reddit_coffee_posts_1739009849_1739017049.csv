1iklztn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackClover/comments/1iklztn/black_clover_project_zoo_3/,Black Clover: Project Zoo! :3,"So, whilst waiting for the next chapter of the manga, I decided to work on a little project in the Planet Zoo game: a Golden Dawn base themed zoo!

Here's how it's looking so far. The night screenshot is low quality because I forgot to turn my graphics back up after rendering 12,000 objects ;\_\_; 

I'm not entirely happy with the lowest level of the base, but I'd gotten too far to go back and fix it, so meh, it'll do!

My proudest accomplishment - the 1970s Space Invaders style stained glass window of the main hall (image 4). It took foreeeever to create.

The aim is for this to be an actual functioning zoo, so I've still got a lot of work to do. The Golden Dawn base will be a bird-themed area, with a variety of different bird enclosures. Peacocks are sure to feature heavily. :3

STAGE 2: Once the bird area is up and running, another quarter of the zoo will be given over to a Black Bulls base (which will be set in a Japan-themed area)

STAGE 3: Underwater temple (going to be an actual PITA to create) with water-themed animals

STAGE 4: Forest of Witches, should be the easiest stage once I've figured out how to make something that resembles the world's biggest tree-building.

Wish me luck and send coffees! :3",1,1739016922.0,BlackClover,1,1.0,False

The logic behind it was, the drink would dilute the strong acid (pH2 I believe?), leading to ineffective digestion. And, fine, it makes sense.

On the other hand, it also makes sense to me that perhaps if you drink as you consume your food and dilute your stomach acid, your body will take longer to digest it, thus staying full longer.

1iklryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1iklryk/redcoffee_making_sonarqube_reports_shareable_for/,RedCoffee: Making SonarQube Reports Shareable for Everyone,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm excited to share a new update for [RedCoffee](https://pypi.org/project/redcoffee/), a Python package that generates SonarQube reports in PDF format, making it easier for developers to share analysis results efficiently.

# Motivation:

Last year, while working on a collaborative side project, my team and I integrated SonarQube to track code quality. Since this was purely a learning-focused initiative, we decided to use the SonarQube Community Edition, which met our needs‚Äîexcept for a few major limitations:

* There was no built-in way to share the analysis report.
* Our SonarQube instance was running locally in a Docker container.
* No actively maintained plugins were available to generate reports.

After some research, I found an old plugin that supported PDF reports, but it had not been updated since 2016. Seeing no viable solution, I decided to build RedCoffee, a CLI-based tool that allows users to generate a PDF report for any SonarQube analysis, specifically designed for teams using the Community Edition.

I first introduced RedCoffee on this subreddit around nine months ago, and I received a lot of valuable feedback. Some developers forked the repository, while others raised feature requests and reported bugs. This update includes fixes and enhancements based on that input.

**What's new in the recent update ?**  
An Executive summary is now visible at the top of the report. This will highlight the number of bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells and % of duplication. This is based on a feature request raised by an user on Github.  
The second one is a bug fix where people were facing issues in installing the library because the requests package was missing in the required dependency section. This was also raised by an user on Github.

**How It Works?**

Installing RedCoffee is straightforward. It is available on PyPI, and I recommend using version 1.1, which is the latest long-term support (LTS) release.

    pip install redcoffee==1.1

For those who already have RedCoffee installed, please upgrade to the latest version:  
`pip install --upgrade redcoffee`

Once installed, generating a PDF report is as simple as running:

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} \ --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} \ --path=${PATH_TO_SAVE_PDF} \ --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

This command fetches the analysis data from SonarQube and generates a well-structured PDF report.

**Target Audience:**  
RedCoffee is particularly useful for:

* Small teams and startups using SonarQube Community Edition hosted on a single machine.
* Developers and testers who need to share SonarQube reports but lack built-in options.
* Anyone learning Click ‚Äì the Python library used to build CLI applications.
* Engineers looking to explore SonarQube API integrations.

**Comparison with Similar Tools :** There used to be a plugin called SonarPDF, but it has not been actively maintained for several years. RedCoffee provides a modern, well-maintained alternative.

I kinda just go to a few different places like the coffee shop, a restaurant, gym, etc.. I don‚Äôt exactly exercise there hardly much. I mostly only go there for smoothies, and water. I also haven‚Äôt been to a coffee shop hardly as much as I use to. Literally have been told out of the blue to save my money by two strangers. One from each cafe on different occasions. They don‚Äôt really seem to work there. Them telling that, kinda made me not want to go back to either.

I‚Äôve been getting back home sometime roughly between 5:40 ish to maybe around 6:35 ish. I‚Äôve been getting off late around 4:45 pm. I almost always stay late helping customers and cleaning. when I come back home, I kinda just lounge around. I sit and eat. Then I just lay in bed until I fall asleep. Roughly sometime around 8, 9, maybe or 10 pm. 

I want to change my sleeping habits. I would like to have a consistent sleep schedule. I would also like to not just fall asleep without doing my night time routine. Like burning my teeth, charging my phone, drinking water. What could I do to change this?

1iklpa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1iklpa7/how_its_going_for_me_1_month_in/,How it's going for me - 1 month in,"Started taking ozempic exactly 1 month ago. 1.92m 39yrs old male.

Nothing but a smooth experience so far. 0,25 and 0,5mg had a very nice effect. Immediately just eliminated hunger. And no real side effects.  Odd things I noticed: I crash much harder after drinking lots of coffee now. And also, weirdly, roasted peanuts taste SO good now. But I do still have food noise.

It is because eating is an activity for me that I like to do when I'm bored. I still want to see if Ozempic can get rid of that so that I can unlearn this behavior. So I am still dosing up.

Other than that, I just learned to significantly shrink my portion sizes, which is absolutely great. When I ""just eat"" my normal portions, I suffer. I quickly learned not to do that ;)

So, here's one thing that Ozempic already did for me. I eat my main meals like a normal person now.  Still need to unlearn the snacking behavior, but also this has reduced significantly.

No fitness activity, no tracking calories. Just living like a normal human being in the last 4 weeks. I do have a history of extreme behavior. Weighed 170kgs until 2019, lost all of it until 2022 and weighed 92kg at 16% body fat through basically obsessive daily running. I was **extremely** fit until I was extremely burned out. Now, I want to keep a healthy balance of physical activity once I get past ca. 105kg. I do love running in warm weather, and I do love walking, so it is nothing I would like to abolish completely.

TL;DR- I hit my head i think pretty hard. Confident i have some degree of concussion. Do I need to go to er with continued symptoms?

Just about 24 hours ago I hit my head pretty good.

My husband and I took a little getaway type of trip to a coastal town less than 2 hours away. So, relatively unfamiliar room/bathroom layout, I guess, maybe as far as ""muscle memory"" goes but spacious and not complicated by any means.

Anyway. I'm i can't really explain how things happened as I have zero recollection of the events. About 6 a.m we were sleeping and I seemingly got up to go to the bathroom but I came to/gained consciousness on the floor.

The toilet is positioned next to a shower, with  stone tile half-walling it in, to the right of it. It seems that I somehow fell from standing (not seated) height and fell into/landed on the corner edge of the shower wall and doorway entrance (like where the wall and doorway entrance/side/wall meet type of corner ""line"" and not a pointed corner like a square). The outside of my right arm helped to break my fall but I did slam the right side of my head into (onto) that corner pretty much right at my temple. The arm of my glasses seemed to offer some protection too.

I don't know how I fell. I don't know why. I know that I brought my phone into the bathroom with me as it was on the sink (out of toilet reach), there was also urine and TP (sorry TMI) in the toilet, and my PJ pants were pulled up normally as one does when finished using a toilet. This all tells me that when I got up to use the bathroom I was aware enough to plan to bring my phone with me, that I was conscious enough to properly go to the bathroom and pull my pants up when finished. But I have no memory of any of this. I only remember going to bed and sleep hours before. 

As I gained consciousness, initially I couldn't feel my legs, rho I was sat on the ground as if I knelt, sat back, and the leaned to the right - so sat on my right thighs and hip area. I also couldn't see. I felt searing pain, knew I hit my head but thought also my face and that I was bleeding (I wasnt). I still couldn't see as I screamed for help. Took a good full minute before my sight was fully regained. 

I started to puke nearly immediately after gaining full consciousness. In addition to pain, I was incredibly dizzy, nauseous, and incredibly confused. Since I wasn't bleeding or obviously broken I decided it was best to at least head home before trying to see any doctor.

We were checking out yesterday morning anyway so my husband packed up the car then as I rested. I ended up falling asleep every few minutes but I think I was drifting in and out of consciousness, actually. I also could not stay awake in the drive home. To the point where I'd spill a drink in myself, falling asleep while holding or sipping a coffee as opposed to placing it in the cup holder right next to me first. 

We got home (to my.moms where our son was staying) and i immediately went to sleep. I was being monitored and haven't been left fully alone.

Here's my question- I know nothing can be done for a concussion, which i clearly have, but given that I'm still struggling, should I go get imagine done and checked by a doctor to make sure nothing is going on with my brain? Would you go and endure waiting in an ER with a headache (not the worst pain in my body nor the worst headache I've ever had), cause my back/chronic pain to likely flare and increase, gamble if the dr will be kind or treat me like an addict when they see my regular scripts, *and* expose myself to all the sick people and possible viruses like flu covid rvs whatever others may have? 

Currently I have  nasty bruises and sizable knots/eggs/bumps or whatever they're called on my arm but most importantly my head at/around my temple. Feeling nauseous. My head hurts. I'm still dizzy. Constantly tired. My vision blurs at times, often enough to be irritating or make things difficult. I've also had moments of mild confusion or just generally having a hard time with anything. This post has gotten super long but has taken me over an hour now to create dealing with all these symptoms. My eyes/pupils seem to be normal though. My speech is fine, if now slow due to pain particularly when I move my jaw and overall headache. 

I hate the ER. I feel like if I was with someone who injured themselves like this I'd have taken them to er immediately. But my husband and mom are both like ""we'll take you if you want but you seem to be ok. We watched you sleep and you were fine"". No i dont WANT to go! Like, I'm being dramatic by wondering if I should just make sure my brain isn't bleeding or swollen? I already know I have a concussion- I've had a mild one before and this feels like that but exponentially worse.

Would you go to ER? Or would you just sleep off? Am I just being anxious? Has it been long enough that I'm in the clear now? I can't help but think of Natasha Richardson. And the fact that I hit my temple/most sensitive area of my head reasonably hard. Is it worth the risk to other sick people and enduring the ER?

1iklo8a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iklo8a,Infested neighbor?,"Hello everyone! 

I've been reading a few posts on here ever since I came across this guy hiding in my shower. I have glass doors that have silicone borders which are hollow and he was cozy in there. Got him out by using my blow dryer. Flushed him down the toilet. 

After that I closed all my drains, figuring he must have come from the shower drain as he crawled into the very first hiding spot he could find from there. I thought I was okay but a few days later I found one in the kitchen. I have this extractor hood which I can extend by pulling it forward to open. It also has a little lamp when it's open. Anyways I dry my wet rag on there after cleaning the kitchen. One morning I came to do the dishes and grabbed that rag and something flew out and disappeared under the sink. Needles to say I lost my mind. Immediately went looking for it but I couldn't find it. I only saw it for a second but it was about the same size as the one in the pictures. I packed up all my food in my pantry and checked everything. Moved what I could into the fridge. I burned some coffee and let the smoke spread in all the cupboards and let it suck up the extractor hood bc that usually repels bugs. I hoped it would run out bc of the smoke but it didn't. That was beginning of January, great start to the year.

Ever since then it's been quiet. I've been keeping my kitchen and my apartment (20sqm studio) clean and very dry. Opening the window all the time. Using cold water after using warm water to keep my pipes cold in order to create a less habitable environment. Smoking my cabinets with those incense sticks. I've also been keeping the extractor hood closed bc I'm just scared more will find their way in. While cleaning all the cabinets I haven't seen any signs of an infestation. At least no poop, idk what other signs there are. I've sent my landlord the video but they didn't react. I live in Germany btw lol. 

I live in a huge apartment complex, like 300 apartments. The building was built in 2020, so it's always nice and warm, perfect to attract the little critters. 

I guess my question is, do I pressure my landlord to do something? Could this be the start of an infestation? I have a feeling they're coming in through the pipes. I heard they can also travel ON the pipes. I'm pretty sure it was German too, it had that significant stripe on its back.

I'm honestly really really scared and I would like to ask you to be gentle with me with your answers. I'm 23 I'm a woman and I live alone and through this experience I discovered that I'm terrified of the creatures. Thank you all in advance.

I would have to hold the pose and wait a minute for it to slide back down. It didn‚Äôt hurt but it felt weird. I think I got it from pregnancy, had three kids. I stopped doing those Pilates poses but I love yoga and would go several times a week.

June last year I had umbilical hernia repair and diastasis repair surgery. It went great. I was just starting to use my abs again and return fully to normal exercise routines when‚Ä¶

It was the holidays, I was overeating a big. I was eating leftovers after Christmas and probably too large a portion and I got acid reflux, no big deal I thought, chew some tums and it will go away.

It didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been 6 weeks about and still have acid reflux. I started a strict gerd diet with the new year. I gave up coffee, alcohol, tomatoes, citrus, fatty foods, processed foods, refined sugar, spicy foods, pretty much all the joys of life. The diet helped but it didn‚Äôt cure it. Like I just would feel a constant low-level sour stomach and loss of appetite.

Went to my doctor and he prescribed a strong proton pump inhibitor. I did that for 2 weeks and I felt normal on that and even cheated on my diet a bit. I had coffee one day, I had pizza one day, and was fine. But those drugs are not good for long term so after 2 weeks I was done, I kept the diet, but the reflux returned. So now I am taking Nexium. But I think long term being on that is not great for you either.

I am waiting to see a GI specialist but I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment until March 18. 

Has anyone dealt with hiatal hernia? I know it‚Äôs not a terminal diagnosis (unless you develop esophageal cancer!) but it doesn‚Äôt seem great to live your life with even low level acid reflux all the time. Eating was one of my few pleasures in life and this strict diet deprived me of that. (And yes I also try not to eat several hours before bed. I eat dinner between 5-6 and don‚Äôt eat after that.) 

Some people are telling me just to stay with the strict diet, others recommend homeopathic drugs, which I am a little suspicious of, but I try to keep an open mind. 

Was thinking of switching to Pepcid which seems less bad long term than Nexium and seeing if that can still work.

I know everyone is different and I am going to a specialist, but it‚Äôs a long wait. I want to see if I can manage symptoms between now and then and not be miserable. 

Also I really really loved yoga and now I find I can‚Äôt do it without it making acid reflux work. I need to figure out a new exercise routine but yoga was so great for my mental health and was something that really helped me cope with the stressors of work and kids. 

I am well aware that even low levels of acid reflux, if left untreated, can lead to cancer of the esophagus.

But for God‚Äôs sakes the Starbucks by my work literally stops paying customers from using the bathrooms and locks them over an hour before they close. They also block the trash cans and stop letting people order food ‚Äúbecause the oven is off.‚Äù They also ‚Äúclose the dining room‚Äù and ask people to move and all sit on top of each other in one corner. News flash- you are literally open.

This whole song and dance starts *two hours* before they close. You read that correctly. This is insane. The staff are insanely passive aggressive and seem put out that people are even there. 

And I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre selling coffee which literally makes people need to pee and you‚Äôre refusing to let people use the restroom?

Karens are the worst. But people who work in service roles and have this fuming resentment toward people just buying a coffee are crazy. I was friendly to people at my job even when I wasn‚Äôt in the mood- it‚Äôs not that big of a deal to be mildly pleasant, and giving someone eye daggers because they ordered a drink an hour before you close is insane.

Hi everyone. I am trying out water fasting for the first time. Aiming for it to be only 3 days as a start. I'm 18, 84kg, 172cm. I am fairly muscular, an athlete if i dare say, I am also a student and want to maintain a high gpa. So, I thought about drinking water AND a cup of coffee a day, no sugar or milk ofc. Wanted to know if there are any dangers, would it affect my concentration ability, how should i approach refeeding. and if drinking ONE cup of coffee is safe while water fasting. I will drink lots of water everyday as I understand how well it helps with cognitive functions let alone that I am doing water fasting. Any tips/advice are welcome as it is my first time!!!! TYIA

Some tips I got:
- Use some salt in the water for electrolytes, currently only have normal table salt in all honesty so will use that, dont know about the amount per litre tho
- Don't forget to drink lots of water
- Ketosis starts after the 16 hour
- And to try to push it and dont drink coffee for the first two days. I really want to drink some for the taste, and caffeine to concentrate more on my studies. It would be coffee with no milk or sugar, with spices of turkish coffee and nothing else",2,1739014865.0,Water_Fasting,0,1.0,False

1ikldm1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ikldm1,El Rey del Mundo Demi Tasse review,"I picked up this cigar from JJ Fox in London after a recommendation from their sommeliers as a top-tier short smoke. Now with over four years of age, it has developed beautifully, easily outperforming many of the larger 44+ ring gauge cigars I‚Äôve tried.

First Third: Smooth and balanced flavors of chocolate, cedar, and honey make for an inviting start. The draw was surprisingly perfect‚Äîespecially for a smaller ring gauge, which often has issues.

Second Third: A warm note of nutmeg emerges, bringing a cake-like sweetness with a subtle hint of coffee. The flavor profile is distinct and stands out from other cigars in this category.

Last Third: Creamy leather comes into play, while the chocolate deepens into a rich cocoa with a touch of spice. Every puff was a pleasure, and I didn‚Äôt want to put it down‚Äîfar exceeded my expectations.

Burn & Construction: The burn line was absolutely immaculate, staying razor-sharp from start to finish. The ash on this little beauty was superb‚Äîholding firm and stacking impressively well for such a small format.

Final Thoughts: This cigar is an absolute must-try. The Demi Tasse is easily the best small-ring gauge cigar I‚Äôve had, even surpassing well-known alternatives like the Cohiba Panetela and Montecristo Joyita.

A week has passed since I heard your voice. I still think about you all of the time. It‚Äôs unhealthy, but my brain instantly thinks of something else. It‚Äôs almost too painful to grieve. 

I can‚Äôt even sleep properly. I fight it. I toss and I turn. I‚Äôm too anxious to see you in my dreams, knowing I‚Äôll wake up and you won‚Äôt be here. I think about the shape of your body next to mine, the scent of your hair, my fingers against your skin. 

We meshed so fucking well together, it was uncanny and baffling and beautiful. Until we didn‚Äôt. I know it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault, so I blame the universe, trying to avoid feeling cursed. This didn‚Äôt work out like we‚Äôd hoped it would, and I‚Äôm sorry for all of my shortcomings that contributed to the end. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get over you. I keep thinking about all the things I should‚Äôve done. All the adventures we never got to go on. 

I keep fantasizing about holding you again. I think about how no matter how tight I hugged you, or how much we entangled ourselves, it was never enough. I wanted to crawl into your skin and live in your rib cage. I think about how soft your hands used to be. Our voice memos and silly pictures. The sound of the water against the shore at the beach where we often shared a joint. The sunlight through my window while we‚Äôre snuggled in my bed after a long day of adventures. 

Your fingers in my hair (you always loved to tousle it after a haircut). Your gasps when I kissed your neck and your jawline. Your lips and your teeth and your cute ears. The way you looked at me, truly looked at me with those big hazel eyes (I could stare into them forever, which said a lot because eye contact always spooks me). 

Your brown hair put up in twin buns that night we went to the gay bar (we kissed by a jasmine plant that night and I‚Äôll never be able to smell jasmine again.) Your laugh and the way you used to excitedly say, ‚Äúomg babe, I forgot to tell you!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you, my girl.‚Äù Where does that feeling go? The one that happens when you fall in love; they‚Äôre the first person you tell good news and bad news to, or funny occurrences throughout the day. Do you tuck those thoughts away like I do?

Do you think of me? When you light up your incense in the holder I got you for your birthday? You told me I know you so well. Do you try to shake it? When you‚Äôre at work, using the notepads I got you for Christmas? When you slide into bed and remember all the times we were intertwined, whispering to each other until we were just too tired to process anything? When you drive and don‚Äôt see me in the passenger seat? When you make coffee in the morning? When you‚Äôre picking out your work clothes late at night and see the hand-me-downs I gave you? I always thought it was kismet that we were the same sizes. And you had a way with rocking every single style effortlessly.  

You used to send me videos that said ‚Äúus in another life.‚Äù In another life, one where you aren‚Äôt a parent‚Ä¶ one where I live closer‚Ä¶ one where we‚Äôre both healed from our traumas completely and the past doesn‚Äôt exist. One where you‚Äôre ready for something healthy. We‚Äôre two cats basking. Two ducks (like the ones we used to feed at the park) settled on the grass after eating peas. Two crows in synchronized flight. Two Lilly pads floating on the surface. Two lovers who never have to let go. 

I had to get rid of your number, because it‚Äôs too tempting to text you. I feel antsy and spacey, clinging onto the hope that you might text me and tell me you‚Äôre in the neighborhood and you want to drop off things I left at your house. I wonder if you feel like I do, driving through town, seeing trails and memories where the ghosts of our former selves have been. 

I hope that you know I still care about you. I hope that we can forgive each other for some of the things we said because we were in pain. I can‚Äôt stop crying, it feels like I just fold at the smallest things. Who will my Saturdays be dedicated to now?

What can I do to ease his doubts ?,"So as the title suggests, my (F21) ex (M23) has doubts about us getting back together. We had been dating for two years, and I broke up with him 1 year and a half ago. At the time, I was struggling with depression and I felt overwhelmed by pretty much everything in my life and I decided to break up though I still loved him. I know I broke his heart, and I'm taking accountability for that. I have regretted breaking up as soon as I did, and as we had been meaning to get engaged, it was a huge blow. I have basically been unable to bond with anyone since then, and I still love him more than anything. 

In December, I decided to reach out to him, and we had long conversations in which he told me everything he went through during the break up, shared his traumas and told me he also has been unable to date since then. It made me realize I hurt him even more than I thought. After two weeks of complex and emotional conversations, we met for a coffee. It went well, he made comments about how it looked like our first date (we grabbed a coffee on our first date, and it was a rainy day as well). However, he seemed reluctant to rekindle. At that moment, I wanted us to be friends. He expressed that he never saw me as a friend and never will, and that it would be a waste of time for the both of us as I would hope for a friendship in vain and (quoting his exact words) he would ""hope for very different things"". 

Consequently, I decided to be upfront and told him I still loved him, and I was eager to relearn to know him and to build something new. He said he had doubts, and that he was reluctant because what we had is dead. I agreed and told him that it is not about coming back to what we had, but rather build something new. I'm a very optimistic person, so I tried to reassure him and told him that trying doesn't mean anything, that in the worst case scenario it fails and that's all. I just said that I wanted him to give me a chance to prove that we can build something new. 
He is not fully against the idea, but he said he needed time and he has doubts. I get it, because once again, I really hurt him, and it's a lot to digest in a short time. I totally understand that trusting me again seems like a risky idea from his point of view, and that it is not easy to build something new. Besides, we've both changed since we've been seperated so it doesn't guarantee that we will be as good as we once were. But I really think that it's worth trying, because as long as there's love, there's hope.

Context: I haven't dated for a very long time (years) so I tend to second-guess myself quite a lot. I live in Paris.

  
I have a nice group of friends at work with whom I go for runs on lunch breaks, and often have lunch with. In late December, one of them brought along this girl from his team for lunch, I sat next to her and we talked quite a bit (she's from abroad, her french is not very good, we spoke english - I'm fluent so np there).

It was nice but I didn't think much of it. Early January (\~10 days later) I meet her at my office's coffee place, she was with colleagues. She sees me and says hi, happy new year, and engages warmly. We talked about our new year vacation very briefly and that was it. Later on that day and the next we exchanged sweet glances when running into each other.

Soon after, I talked to her on the company's chat, she engaged very positively, it was a bit flirty, and I asked if she wanted to join one of our runs someday, she said yes. I reinitiated the next week but she wasn't available (she sometimes works in another building), but we kept chatting, started talking a bit about our lives, it got pretty flirty. The week after she joins us for a run, it was really fun, we all went to lunch afterwards. At the end of that day, I chat her asking if she wants to have lunch together some time, she says yes, she's working from the other building beginning of next week, and I have some things planned myself so we agree on next Friday. In the meantime I've added her on Strava.

We kept chatting, still quite flirty, I suggested a place to go for our Friday lunch, she was very enthusiastic. At that point I would say I had initiated 3 times on the company's chat, and she had initiated once.

Come Friday (last week), we go to lunch and it's very fun, we talk about our lives, have good laughs, she likes the place. I offer to buy her lunch but she turns it down and we split the bill (just mentioning it, didn't think it was good or bad). On the way back I ask her number. She suggests we have coffee later in the afternoon, so we meet again at the office coffee place and it's really nice, we're connecting, she tells me about her plans for the weekend and how she likes manual activities and she will go to a ceramics workshop, I also talk about some tea place in Paris she could like, after coffee I send her the address and we engage a bit on whatsapp.

  
The conversation we had really got me inspired and I started thinking about something hands-on I could try myself and as I've always wanted to try origami, on Saturday I go to an origami shop and buy some paper and a tutorial book and start experimenting and it's really fun. Also while riding my bike nearby, I saw a pottery store and took a picture as it reminded me of her workshop.

On Sunday I write her on whatsapp, and share that picture and how it made me think about her and her ceramics thing, she engages right away very positively, she was going to her workshop at that moment. She sends me pictures of the vase she's making, and I send pictures of the (beginner) origami I've been making. She loves it, the interaction is very nice and flirty, tell her I can't wait to see her ceramic creation complete.

That was last Sunday, and since then I've felt she's pulled back quite strongly. She hasn't reengaged on Whatsapp since. On Tuesday I went for a run with my coworkers, she liked the Strava post, I used that to reinitiate on the company's chat but she felt more distant, taking a very long time to answer each message (although her messages were nice) so I didn't insist. She's been absent from work since (so from Wed to Friday), and the only sign I've had is another like on Strava on Thursday.

I'm starting to have huge doubts as to whether she was just being friendly, whether I showed too much interest too quickly, whether I'm overthinking this and she just has her own pace. But it did feel like the interaction was great and then suddenly she went silent. I know it's not been such a long silence but my intuition (which may be mistaken) tells me something's wrong.

1ikl0ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ikl0ip/an_unsent_letter_one_week_down/,an unsent letter: one week down,"A week has passed since I heard your voice. I still think about you all of the time. It‚Äôs unhealthy, but my brain instantly thinks of something else. It‚Äôs almost too painful to grieve. 

I can‚Äôt even sleep properly. I fight it. I toss and I turn. I‚Äôm too anxious to see you in my dreams, knowing I‚Äôll wake up and you won‚Äôt be here. I think about the shape of your body next to mine, the scent of your hair, my fingers against your skin. 

We meshed so fucking well together, it was uncanny and baffling and beautiful. Until we didn‚Äôt. I know it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault, so I blame the universe, trying to avoid feeling cursed. This didn‚Äôt work out like we‚Äôd hoped it would, and I‚Äôm sorry for all of my shortcomings that contributed to the end. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get over you. I keep thinking about all the things I should‚Äôve done. All the adventures we never got to go on. 

I keep fantasizing about holding you again. I think about how no matter how tight I hugged you, or how much we entangled ourselves, it was never enough. I wanted to crawl into your skin and live in your rib cage. I think about how soft your hands used to be. Our voice memos and silly pictures. The sound of the water against the shore at the beach where we often shared a joint. The sunlight through my window while we‚Äôre snuggled in my bed after a long day of adventures. 

Your fingers in my hair (you always loved to tousle it after a haircut). Your gasps when I kissed your neck and your jawline. Your lips and your teeth and your cute ears. The way you looked at me, truly looked at me with those big hazel eyes (I could stare into them forever, which said a lot because eye contact always spooks me). 

Your brown hair put up in twin buns that night we went to the gay bar (we kissed by a jasmine plant that night and I‚Äôll never be able to smell jasmine again.) Your laugh and the way you used to excitedly say, ‚Äúomg babe, I forgot to tell you!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you, my girl.‚Äù Where does that feeling go? The one that happens when you fall in love; they‚Äôre the first person you tell good news and bad news to, or funny occurrences throughout the day. Do you tuck those thoughts away like I do?

Do you think of me? When you light up your incense in the holder I got you for your birthday? You told me I know you so well. Do you try to shake it? When you‚Äôre at work, using the notepads I got you for Christmas? When you slide into bed and remember all the times we were intertwined, whispering to each other until we were just too tired to process anything? When you drive and don‚Äôt see me in the passenger seat? When you make coffee in the morning? When you‚Äôre picking out your work clothes late at night and see the hand-me-downs I gave you? I always thought it was kismet that we were the same sizes. And you had a way with rocking every single style effortlessly.  

You used to send me videos that said ‚Äúus in another life.‚Äù In another life, one where you aren‚Äôt a parent‚Ä¶ one where I live closer‚Ä¶ one where we‚Äôre both healed from our traumas completely and the past doesn‚Äôt exist. One where you‚Äôre ready for something healthy. We‚Äôre two cats basking. Two ducks (like the ones we used to feed at the park) settled on the grass after eating peas. Two crows in synchronized flight. Two Lilly pads floating on the surface. Two lovers who never have to let go. 

I had to get rid of your number, because it‚Äôs too tempting to text you. I feel antsy and spacey, clinging onto the hope that you might text me and tell me you‚Äôre in the neighborhood and you want to drop off things I left at your house. I wonder if you feel like I do, driving through town, seeing trails and memories where the ghosts of our former selves have been. 

I hope that you know I still care about you. I hope that we can forgive each other for some of the things we said because we were in pain. I can‚Äôt stop crying, it feels like I just fold at the smallest things. Who will my Saturdays be dedicated to now?

1ikkyuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nightmarefuel/comments/1ikkyuw/i_need_to_talk_through_my_scary_nightmare/,I need to talk through my scary nightmare.,"-disclaimer u can skip this I‚Äôm just stressed ‚Äîokay okay. It‚Äôs 5:43.M am. I‚Äôve been on the cusp of a breakdown all week. All month really. I don‚Äôt drink coffee, but some things have changed for me. I stopped taking magnesium then restarted again and I haven‚Äôt had any weed other than a horrible little pen. (Don‚Äôt hit well and makes me feel disconnected from my body) i smoke a bowl of flower before i go to bed usually but not recently. It‚Äôs 3 days after my 23rd birthday. I don‚Äôt like a lot of horror things in media. 

I dreamt I found a little girl screaming, screaming so hard after being shoved into the fold out part of my car.  She was so scared. And I knew her. Vivid as day. So personally I knew her. She felt like a missing kid in the castle I work at. (It‚Äôs a big property and all outside other than gift shop and work areas). We lost her. And it was a panic at first. I could feel it in my chest that someone had hurt her. I only found her because I went to check the tree line with a good friend. She was real. I reached out and grabbed her and held her so tightly. I couldn‚Äôt reach my walkie out of pure shock and terror. I‚Äôm one of those people who can‚Äôt do the mirror maze or a corn maze in the broad daylight. I freeze. I freeze hard when it‚Äôs not real. I feel paralyzed. I am pretty paranoid and not grounded person sometimes when it‚Äôs bad. We almost gave up the search.  We assumed she was kidnapped, which is not a better fate than what happened. She was horribly bodily manipulated by being shoved into the car. I don‚Äôt know why it wasn‚Äôt locked. I could just hear her screaming as we were walking away. The worst part is, the place I work irl, we don‚Äôt have a good system for bad things when they happen. We don‚Äôt have that people can control the parking lot. I held this mangled child, she was probably 8 years old, and yelled for someone to call 911. We made no announcement for the lost kid. No one tried enough. They just stared and didn‚Äôt ask and walked past. My friend just doesn‚Äôt have the training or instincts to know what to do. She tried to call 911. I woke right as her head dropped, her skin held her head on by a tread. Her little head fell under my car in the back and that caught other attention. I panicked the hardest here. People flocked and seemed to look at me like I did something first to hurt her. I just held her headless body so close. 

It was so awful. I am currently curled up on the bathroom floor so scared to see her again when I close my eyes.

Previous Attempts: I‚Äôm having a hard time saying no nicely and nauubusan na ko ng reason (az non confrontational). Eto yung mga naiisip ko on how to approach this situation:
-I‚Äôll let him know na ‚Äúdi ko bet‚Äù without any reason or suggestion na sa ibang araw na lang
-wag ko siya kausapin buong next week
-ipuno ang sched ko kahit lunch buong week so I have valid reason
-i can simply say ayoko‚Äù ‚Äúwag na‚Äù pero feel ko i need to give a reason why üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Kaya ko naman kumain mag isa sa mga resto na bet ko kaya di ako makikipag dinner just bc for the libreng food kasi ayoko mamisinterpret niya. Ang hirap ng situation ko kasi coworker ko and i dont want any awkwardness üò≠ madali lang sana iseen na lang kaso same kami ng discipline üò≠

175 cm, slim and fit

I enjoy reading (news, books, webtoons), anything with an engine üèçÔ∏è, working out (mostly so I can eat more meat), traveling to unique places, or just chilling at home with a movie and popcorn.

I know what I want in life and I go after it, but I also enjoy the ride. I like learning random things, figuring out how stuff works, and keeping my mind busy... call it curiosity, or a fun waste of time.

Not a fan of small talk. I wanna talk about atoms, death, aliens, the moon, magic, intellect, the meaning of life, faraway galaxies, the lies you've told, your flaws, your favorite scents, your childhood, what keeps you up at night, your insecurities and fears... I like people with depth, who speak from emotion from a slightly twisted mind.

I brought 2 fantas (one for me and my sister) and dry shampoo. about an hour after we got home my mum came home and said she'd put ¬£5 in my sisters bank to make it fair. (it wasn't fair as my sister had asked for ¬£5 on Monday which my mum sent, but she didn't send me any). at this point I was pissed because I've always been left out, both my parents have always favoured my sister (15f) over me. what happened next is very random lol, I asked my mum where she was getting her coffee from because we had none in the house but she still had some in her mug. she said she orders it on amazon. I told her I meant the coffee she's drinking right now. she then said that I should've given her context but like.. isn't it obvious? i see it come in the amazon box when it arrives.. whatever. I call her stupid and then she basically just calls me stupid, so I repeat whatever she said in a mocking tone and then told her to stfu. she then was like ""someone's in a mood and it's not me"" in a super annoying voice. I lost it and said something like ""no, it is you. you're always in a mood because you're always in pain you fat cow"". I don't really remember what happened after that, some more arguing probably, but i heard her mutter ""I wish you were at your dads"". I kind of overreacted a bit but she always does stuff like this. she's so immature and childish. (examples; when I got my GCSE results she took me to McDonald's to get my fav drink and then asked if my sister likes it too.. like? this is for me because of what I did. ugh. they always get mcdonald's without me on Fridays because that's when I go to my dads - my sister doesn't go anymore. and one time I asked if we could have mcdonald's when my sister wasn't there and my mum said no bc she'd be missing out... uh yeah I can relate. but I said we could wait until she got back but she still said no :( there's loads more examples but you get the idea.) anyway, AITA?

edit: both of my parents have clearly always favoured my sister. my mum has been incredibly mean these past few years and I just snapped. I can't take it lol, especially because we used to be close but she just changed ? I'm constantly left out and made to do things my sister doesn't have to do. when I was like 8 I literally told my dad to his face i wanted to die because of how I'm treated haha

edit 2: another example is when my dad texts me to ask how my sister is and doesn't even bother asking how I am ü•≤

edit 3: when I was doing my GCSEs my mum said she'd get me a maths tutor but didn't. but this year she got one for my sister :( but thankfully I passed maths anyway, idk how lol

edit 4: my mum also tells me off all the time for things my sister has done. e.g. my sister spills sugar on the counter, my mum sees, sister doesn't clean it up and I get in trouble. it's really stupid and everytime I'm like??? my sister did that?? you watched her??",0,1739012342.0,AITAH,4,0.33,False

Are you ready to *FINISH HIM* with lag and geo restrictions? I'm talking about the **Best VPNs for Mortal Kombat 11** that'll have you playing online without a hitch, no matter where you are on this crazy blue planet.

# Mortal Kombat VPN: Your Secret Weapon

Look, if you're a diehard MK11 fan, you know how frustrating it is to face off against constant lag spikes or, even worse, find out the game's blocked in your country. That's where a good VPN comes in like a well timed Scorpion spear ‚Äì a true game changer. A solid VPN isn‚Äôt only about circumventing those annoying firewalls and region locks, it's also about getting a better deal on the game itself, reducing lag, and shielding you from malicious hackers.

# What's Inside?

* Why you desperately *need* a VPN for MK11.
* Top VPN contenders, tested and ready to rumble.
* Busting through geo restrictions like a seasoned pro.

# Why a VPN? Is it really worth it?

So, you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúDo I *really* need a VPN to crush skulls in Mortal Kombat?‚Äù Let me lay it out:

* **Unblock the Beatdown:** Some countries have banned MK11 due to its, ahem, *artistic* depiction of violence. A VPN lets you bypass those blocks and join the fray.
* **Defeat Lag:** Lag is the ultimate boss no one wants to face. A VPN can potentially improve your connection by routing your traffic through a less congested server, getting you closer to the action.
* **Stay Safe:** Nobody likes getting DDoSed (Denial of Service attack) mid match. VPNs shield your real IP address, making you a harder target for online baddies.
* **Get a Sweet Deal:** Game prices fluctuate by region. With a VPN, you might snag MK11 for a lot cheaper by virtually teleporting to another country!

**Think of a VPN as your digital bodyguard and personal travel agent, all rolled into one!**

* **Killer Feature:** Special gaming servers optimized for low ping.

For most gamers and regions like US, Canada, Germany. And for a smoother process use Windows as main configuration, given support of gaming consoles to consoles such as x-box, PlayStation can sometimes be configured manually with different set of guidelines.

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1ikkrxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ihadadream/comments/1ikkrxr/car_accident/,Car accident,"I dreamed I was at school, maybe college, got in some kinda van/bus with a friend and older man (driver. Someone I knew) to leave. We started driving, talking for a while, when I smelled coconut perfume super strong. Like I walked past someone. We drove through a rough part of road right after and I looked back to see a girl falling down to ground. I alert the man to stop and rushed out to grab her. She had two large brown dogs. One laying over her and the other hopping around her. Made me nervous but grabbed her quick. We were near a hospital, so rushed her there. She was younger, maybe 8-13 range. I'm not good at guessing that sort of this. She was wearing pj's and covered in dirt, not responsive. Long'ish brown hair. Rushed her in at the ER, told doctors what we knew, side of road/not responsive. Idea hit to tell them about dog in case it was a service animal alerting. Called 911, to let them know where we found her and what happened in case missing kid call came in. Was going to offer to go back to site and go door to door to ask, but suddenly got bad felling. Like maybe no missing call would come in or if she was escaping from bad situation would be alerting where to find her. Dream started to fade away after that thought as my heart was racing too hard.
Was curious to try and go back by going back to sleep right way, but 5am, don't think I can and baby will be up soon. FYI, my room smells like curly fries right now due to have some nearby from late night order. Nothing smells like coconut here, don't have any lotions or sprays that could have been on anything I caught a whiff of, but the smell was so strong and clear during dream. Everyone's faces were clear during dream and even could probably write about markings on one of the dogs, but stuff is starting to fade now. 
Can't shake bad feeling of situation. I sometimes have very vivid dreams where it's like I'm someone else experiencing a situation. Like I'm a man trying to save people from flooded area, a brick layer out in hot red dessert area, or girl getting coffee. The ones that I am actually me in the dream I can control a bit, but the vivid ones that I am someone else I can't. Usually just share with bf or let fade away as weird. Some details will stick with me like a memory due to being so vivid. I had the idea tonight that there might be group on here and there was, so posting. Thanks for reading and goodnight.

**The Situation:**  
Alright Toronto, so I woke up this morning to *the* most ridiculous news: apparently Donald Trump (yes, *that* guy, busy with who-knows-what nowadays) has decided it‚Äôs a great idea to send a few **hundred** American soldiers to invade Canada and, like, take over üòÖ. I‚Äôm sitting here with my double-double from Tim Hortons, trying to process this. Is 2025 bored or what? First we had all those wild events, and now a mini-invasion? It‚Äôs like Trump spun a globe, pointed at Canada and went ‚ÄúYup, let‚Äôs do this, believe me, gonna be **tremendous**.‚Äù

**American Strategy (?)**  
Apparently, the game plan is something like: roll up to Toronto with a couple hundred troops and...declare it the 51st state? ü§î I can almost hear the commentary on Fox News: *‚ÄúOperation Maple Freedom is underway!‚Äù* You know, because clearly we Canadians are just dying to be liberated from our free healthcare and polite society üôÉ. I bet those soldiers are packing winter coats *after* crossing the border ‚Äì surprise, guys, it‚Äôs chilly up here and no, igloos are not a thing in Toronto (unless Airbnb is getting really creative). The whole idea sounds like a bad sequel to the War of 1812, except this time it‚Äôs starring reality TV personalities. Maybe they think we‚Äôll surrender as soon as we see a MAGA hat? Or that we‚Äôll mistake them for American tourists going to Niagara Falls and just wave them through? The strategy is about as clear as a double rainbow over the CN Tower.

**Canadian Reaction:**  
Most of us up north are somewhere between confused üòÇ and highly amused. I mean, how polite do they expect this invasion to be? Are we supposed to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù if *we‚Äôre* in *their* way? This isn‚Äôt exactly Red Dawn ‚Äì it‚Äôs more like an episode of *South Park*. (Anyone else humming ‚ÄúBlame Canada‚Äù right now?) Our Prime Minister gave a very Canadian response, something like, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not very neighborly, eh?‚Äù and probably apologized for it raining on the invaders. Meanwhile, on the streets of Toronto, people are joking about greeting the U.S. troops with Tim Hortons and poutine as a peace offering. Some folks are dusting off their hockey sticks like, ‚ÄúIf they drop in during beer league hours, it‚Äôs on!‚Äù Even the Toronto Maple Leafs fans are like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve endured worse disappointments, we can handle this.‚Äù üòÇ In true Canadian fashion, a few are concerned but most are like, *is this actually happening or is it an elaborate internet prank?*

**Toronto‚Äôs Defense Strategies (Totally Serious, we swear):**  
Since we‚Äôve apparently got to prep for **The Great Mini-Invasion of 2025**, here are some *highly logical* strategies Toronto residents have been joking about:

* **Hockey Stick Brigade:** Form a militia of hockey dads armed with sticks. Nothing says ‚ÄúGTFO‚Äù like a slapshot of a frozen puck at 100mph. üèí
* **Maple Syrup Traps:** Line the streets with maple syrup. Slow those soldiers down like flies on sticky sugar. Plus, it‚Äôll double as a sweet welcome snack if they get cranky. üçÅ
* **Canada Goose Air Force:** Have you *met* Canadian geese? Those honkers are terrifying. Just rile up a flock near the invaders ‚Äì nature‚Äôs winged devils will do the rest. ü¶Ü (Goose emoji, close enough!)
* **Sorry! Attack:** We‚Äôll all yell ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù at the same time. The sheer confusion from our politeness might make their heads explode. Or at least make them pause and say ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù.
* **Tim Hortons Peace Talks:** Offer them Timbits and coffee. No one can continue a war mid-sugar-high/crash. We‚Äôll talk it out over a **double-double** like civilized people. ‚òï
* **Drake Distraction:** Send in Drake to drop a surprise concert. While they‚Äôre busy taking selfies, we sneakily take their batteries out of their radios. Plus, who would invade *The 6ix* while the 6 God is singing ‚ÄúStarted from the Bottom‚Äù? üé§
* **Metric System Confusion:** Switch all road signs to kilometers and Celsius. They‚Äôll be so confused by the 401 being ‚Äú401‚Äù (WTH so many?) and temperatures in the negatives, they might just turn back to recalibrate their GPS. üìè
* **Raccoon Recon Unit:** Toronto‚Äôs trash pandas (raccoons) are fearless and always looking for food. We send them to rummage through the U.S. army rations at 2 AM ‚Äì guaranteed chaos. ü¶ù

**New Job Opportunities (Hiring Now! üíº):**  
Since this *is* r/TorontoJobs, we gotta talk job market ‚Äì apparently, war prep creates some interesting openings! Polish your resumes, folks:

* **Maple Syrup Supply Chain Manager:** Ensure a steady flow of syrup to the front lines (for traps *and* pancake breakfasts). Must love sugar.
* **Hockey Stick Sharpener:** Keep our hockey stick arsenal in tip-top shape. Bonus if you can also sharpen skates ‚Äì never know if we‚Äôll need an impromptu hockey game to decide the war.
* **Goose Wrangler:** Looking for brave souls to direct aggressive geese toward unwelcome visitors. Protective gear (and psychological counseling) provided.
* **Apology Coordinator (Bilingual):** Draft heartfelt apology letters to send post-battle (‚ÄúSorry we had to defeat you, hope you enjoyed your stay, eh‚Äù). French translations a plus!
* **Tim Hortons Tactical Liaison:** Basically hang at Timmy‚Äôs and supply coffee to troops and invaders alike. Canada runs on Timmies ‚Äì even invasions need coffee breaks.
* **Snow Fort Engineer:** In case this goes into winter (or, y‚Äôknow, a random April snowstorm), we‚Äôll need some solid snow fortifications. Igloo-building experience preferred.
* **Pop Culture Propaganda Specialist:** Your job is to blast Celine Dion, Justin Bieber, Nickelback, *and* the ‚ÄúHockey Night in Canada‚Äù theme on loudspeakers as psychological warfare. (They‚Äôll surrender just to make it stop, trust us üòà.)

**Your Move, Toronto (Discussion Time!):**  
So yeah... this whole situation has us shaking our heads and chuckling. Only a few hundred soldiers to take over all of Canada? *Cute.* üòè Honestly, this feels like a weird crossover episode of *The Apprentice* and *Call of Duty*. While we‚Äôre 99.999% sure this ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù isn‚Äôt a thing to actually worry about (and is more likely Trump trying to grab headlines), it‚Äôs given us some grade-A comedy. And hey, nothing brings Canadians together like the chance to one-up an American absurdity with some good old-fashioned sarcasm.

**Toronto folks, how are you ‚Äúprepping‚Äù for our uninvited guests?** Stockpiling ketchup chips and Nanaimo bars? Training an army of beavers to chew through tank wires? üòÇ Are you volunteering for the front-line coffee brigade? Or maybe you‚Äôre just gonna livestream the whole thing on TikTok with the caption ‚ÄúWhen your neighbor tries to prank you but it‚Äôs 3 years too late.‚Äù

Share your survival tactics, one-liners, and any *polite* smack talk below! After all, if 2025 wants to throw us this curveball, the least we can do is hit it back with a hockey stick and a sense of humor. üçÅüá®üá¶ **Game on, eh!**",2,1739011795.0,torontoJobs,0,1.0,False

Also, I don't think I have a very sophisticated palette, so when people talk about subtle differences in things like acidity, I'm not sure if I'd even notice that. I know there will be little differences that will make a difference though, so was hoping for some tips on how to improve my method. At the moment, this is what I do-

*  Around 18g of pre-ground coffee into the Aeropress - I don't want a grinder yet, but I am going to to start buying from a roaster so what I'm using will be much fresher. I haven't figured out how dark I like it yet. I think what I'm using atm is a 4, but I vaguely recall enjoying my previous pack, which was a 6, a bit more.
* Pour 100g of 80¬∞C water into the inverted Aeropress and mix.
* Microwave 200g of barista oat milk for 90 seconds (this gets it to around 70¬∞C. 
* After the 90 seconds, push down on the Aeropress, taking around 30 seconds total.
* Use a handheld frother on the milk, approx doubling the volume.
* Pour the milk into the cup and enjoy.

I know higher quality and fresher coffee will make a noticeable difference. Can anyone recommend anything else I should be doing differently though? Not sure if I should consider a metal filter or a prismo.

In the picture you can see some mock data I am working with (the actual data is much larger and across many sheets).

  
We have a questionnaire, where each question has a score. Each question is linked to up to 3 product (can be less). I want to calculate the average by product, i.e. if the product appears in either column B, C or D.

  
The issue is that AVERAGIFS does not work with a multi-column criteria range. One workaround I have found is to calculate the average and countif of each column separately, and then do a weighted average as a second step. However given the size of my dataset and #sheets this would be quite cumbersome.

  
The issue seems quite simple however I can't seem to get to a viable solution; any suggestions?

He doesn‚Äôt fly much so he doesn‚Äôt have status with UA, and I‚Äôm just a silver. Plane was delayed about 2 hours due to a mechanical issue. No big deal, more time for coffee anyway. Gate changed so we could (presumably) get onboard another E-175. I was about 12th on the upgrade list, and I don‚Äôt get upgraded often anyway, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much.

However in the course of the delay, some people I think left or found other flights which bumped me up to about 4th-6th on the upgrade list.  During the gate change, some people needed to be reassigned seats and my friend asked the gate agent if we could keep our original seats in economy together.  Worked it out and swapped with a lady who was with republic airways.  Cool.

Then‚Ä¶I got upgraded. Was not expecting it at all, leaving my friend in economy. I felt so bad about it seeing him walk down the aisle during boarding as I was seated in first and I mouthed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù to him. The lady next to me was that same lady he talked to earlier. 

‚ÄúIs that your friend and you got upgraded?‚Äù she asked. I said yes, to which she replied ‚Äúah, let him come up here. It‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure??‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah of course! I do this all the time.‚Äù

She was so nice and swapped seats with him, and my buddy who never flew first class before got to sit next to me! Was an incredibly kind gesture, even for just an hour long flight. She was an employee, so I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs had plenty of flights in first on those E jets for Republic.

Thank you, to that very nice employee for Republic airways for making a delay worth it for me and my friend :D

There's one glaring issue with coffee though - to drink it, you first need to get out of bed, and go make/buy it. By the time I'm at the point where I'm actually drinking the coffee, I no longer need it, as I am already out of bed and awake.

When I really need caffeine is right when I wake up. So what I've been doing is setting my alarm 30 minutes earlier, so I can wake up, take a caffeine pill, sleep 30 more minutes, and then wake up feeling very refreshed. This just seems to be so superior to drinking coffee. Especially since it also saves time and money.

I had a mild heart murmur when I was born that didn‚Äôt lead to any complications. Fast forward to middle school and the first time I felt a noticeable difference in my heart rhythm. We were out eating dinner and I remember drinking an excessive amount of soda which led to heart palpitations. I was checked out by the doctor but nothing came of it . 

Fast forward to when I was 19 y.o. I Had a couple days of feeling dizzy but nothing crazy and symptoms went away. 

Then fast forward to 22 y.o. And the first time in my life that I started drinking alcohol regularly and binge drinking on the weekends.  One day out of the blue I get hit with a pretty bad headache and severe dizziness . I went to the hospital , they did a head scan and found nothing. All vitals were good. No noticeable heart rhythm issues. 

At 27 y.o. I had a high stress day at work. I had just recently started drinking coffee in the mornings. This particular morning I had way more coffee than I normally would and very little sleep the night before. Pile that on top of the stress and again I had severe dizziness so bad that I had a coworker drive me home. It went away later in the day. 

Fast forward again to 28 y.o. Going through a difficult time in my relationship and also dealing with a lot more work stress. Also binge drinking on the weekends. In the middle of the work week I get hit with severe dizziness. I go to the hospital and all my vitals are normal. 3 days later I wake up in the middle of the night with an irregular heartbeat and a resting heart rate that keeps jumping up between 100-130 bpm. They give me meds through an iv and discharge me with an ‚Äúanxiety attack‚Äù diagnosis. 

After this episode I meet with the heart doctor. They do an ultra sound of my heart. They say my heart looks strong and there are no issues. I wore the nio heart monitor for 2 weeks to monitor heart rhythm. During this time I am trying to be extra cautious about my heart rhythm. I believe I noticed 3 instances of a heart palpitation during my waking hours. The doctor said they did see the abnormal heartbeat but nothing was alarming. 

Then my most recent episode a few months back. Binge drank pretty heavy 3 weekends apart. After the second binger I had heart palpitations the night of and was so uncomfortable that I couldn‚Äôt lie down. Heart rhythm went back to normal the next day. 3 nights later I wake up in the middle of the night with heart palpitations and an elevated resting heart rate in the 120s. I go to the hospital and get checked in. This was the first time I was diagnosed in an ‚ÄúAFIB‚Äù state. All my vitals are good including my blood pressure so they say my stroke risk was 0 which was good. I was given a couple doses of meds through an IV and was discharged after about 5 hours. 

I went back to the heart doctor and he didn‚Äôt believe I was in afib until he pulled up my chart from the hospital . Since that day I am completely staying away from alcohol. My caffeine intake is almost none. I may occasionally have soda with caffeine but never more than a glass. I have been making better diet choices including eating out much less, and eating a healthier diet at home. I‚Äôm also making a conscious effort to stay hydrated during the day as I never used to drink enough water. 

My heart doctor doesn‚Äôt see the need for any treatment or meds or further constant heart monitoring other than checkups. He states just to abstain from my triggers like alcohol.  I live with constant fear now anytime I‚Äôm feeling a little off or have my occasional heart palpitations, which I believe I have pretty much had my entire life. I‚Äôm considering getting a second opinion from another cardiologist on my condition and symptoms. Idk whether I‚Äôm overreacting . What are your questions/thoughts? ",1,1739010915.0,AFIB,1,1.0,False

The one who keeps reminding you to finish your Fourth Step, who listens to your Fifth Step, and who doesn't tell anyone how weird you are. It's pretty easy to start taking all this stuff for granted once we're used to someone being there for us. We may run wild for a while and tell ourselves, ""I'll call my sponsor later, but right now I have to clean the house, go shopping, chase that attractive..."" And so we end up in trouble, wondering where we went wrong.Our sponsor can't read minds. It's up to us to reach out and ask for help. Whether we need help with our steps, a reality check to help us straighten out our screwy thinking, or just a friend, it's our job to make the request. Sponsors are warm, wise, wonderful people, and their experience with recovery is ours - all we have to do is ask. 

**Just for Today:**¬†I'm grateful for the time, the love, and the experience my sponsor has shared with me. Today I will call my sponsor.",2,1739010855.0,alcoholicsanonymous,0,0.75,False

Hi readers,

  


Today, I lost a good friend‚Äîone I never thought I would lose. We went to the same university, shared similar interests, and were at the same stage in life. There was nothing I could say that she wouldn‚Äôt understand.

  


Every Saturday morning, we would go to caf√©s together. We both had nieces and nephews, and I would let mine talk to her because they adored her‚Äîshe always played with them. We FaceTimed all the time‚Äîwhile eating, driving, playing‚Äîjust living life together. I even confided in her about my crush, something I was too embarrassed to admit to anyone else.

  


She saw me at my worst‚Äîwithout makeup, sick, in my home clothes‚Äîand it never changed the way she treated me. We shared makeup, made little vlogs in her car, took pictures with her digital camera, and talked about the future‚Äîabout marriage, kids, and how we would be at each other‚Äôs weddings.

  


Last Saturday was her birthday. I gifted her LEGO characters that looked like her nieces and nephews, and we enjoyed coffee together. Then we parted ways, heading home‚Äîshe lived in the west, and I lived in the east. Later that day, I noticed she stopped responding to my messages. At first, I brushed it off, but as time passed, my gut told me something was wrong.

  


I saw her active on TikTok, reposting things but ignoring my messages. I felt ghosted. My instincts have never lied to me, and I just *knew* something was off. When I reached out again, she told me she was busy, so I gave her space. But today, I got a text saying our friendship was over.

  


It felt like a stab in the chest. She removed me from all social media. She mentioned struggling with mental health, but I don‚Äôt understand‚Äîif I was the kind of friend she dreamed of, why push me away? If I were in her position, I wouldn‚Äôt let her go either.

  


I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for a long time, too, but having her as a friend made everything feel easier. So, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîwhen life gets hard, does cutting off someone you love really make it better?

1ikkhik,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ikkhik/asking_a_girl_out_on_linkedin/,Asking a girl out on linkedin,"I was at a business meetup about a week ago and saw a really cute chinese girl who seemed a little older than me (maybe 28, and I‚Äôm 23M white). We ended up sitting next to each other at the event, smiling at eachother and taling, and later walked to the train station together. We had pretty solid chemistry‚Äîmaybe an 8.5/10. I find her really physically attractive as well haha.

While we were at the station, I built up the courage to ask her out for a coffee date. She said yes, but for some reason, I had a slight feeling she was just being polite. I messaged her on LinkedIn yesterday, officially asking her out and kinda awkwardly framing it as an opportunity to learn from her since she‚Äôs an accountant, and I'm a startup entrepreneur looking to gain skills. She responded formally, saying she‚Äôll be busy next week but free the week after.

I suggested a coffee meetup on the message, but she responded by stating the fact she‚Äôs free after 6pm on weekdays. Should I invite her to dinner instead? Am I being a bit foolish trying to set up a proper date through LinkedIn? 

She's smart, I bet she's a chess player, because now I'm expected to ask her for dinner and since i invited her, society probably expects me to pay for her meal as well.. just kidding haha

For my backgeound, I‚Äôve only had two relationships, and I feel like I suck at dating. I‚Äôve been on about 10 dates, but I always seem to mess up by not making my intentions clear. I could really use some advice.

And for context I'm a carnvirore as well, so I'll take her out to a steakhouse I think, but don't want to come off too desperate by paying for something kinda expensive on the first so called date. Also don't wanna come off weird lol. I am a weird individual in case you haven't noticed haha",1,1739010761.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

1ikkghi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ikkghi/new_grinder_extremely_inconsistent_kingrinder_k2/,New Grinder extremely inconsistent [Kingrinder K2],"Hi, as a birthday present, I recently got a Kingrinder K2 as I did not have a grinder yet and only used pre-ground coffee (freshly grounded to my liking by my local barista). Since I got it, I tried it out multiple times to find the perfect setting for my beans. Sadly, for some reason, I cannot use the same setting twice. Everytime I try to use the same setting another time, the coffee just drips out of my portafilter. This never happened before.

When I was using the pre-ground (same bean) I got ~35-36ml of coffee with 18gramms of beans in about 23-24 seconds. It tasted great and never had any issues. As soon as I found the perfect setting to grind the beans with (49klicks) I made myself the best coffee I have ever made. But when I tried to make my Significant other a coffee the same day, it just came out dripping, even after a 20 seconds, only 15ml (I wanted to see if the flow maybe picks up, it didn't). And naturally, It didn't taste good. 

Then I tried again, grinding my coffee a tiny bit coarser (50klicks) worked fine for the first time again, second time, not working. 

I have already cleaned it according to instructions, disassembled and reassembled it, tried it out again, no luck.

Does anyone maybe have an idea why this is happening?

More information about my setup:

I use a simple espresso portafilter machine (was my birthday present last year), nothing special, but I know that it can make decent coffee, pulls shots with 15 bar. And I can choose at what temperature I pull. Most of the time this is at around 91 Celsius.

I have a pre-preassured temper (30lbs), worked great with the pre-ground.

No channeling at all. 


If it's of any need: the coffee that comes out when it doesn't work tastes super bitter and sour.

My mum died suddenly and unexpectedly of a spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage last weekend and it has destroyed me.

Her mum died the week before that, and though I wasn‚Äôt close to my nan, and she was often mean and manipulative to my mum, I went to the hospital when it happened to support my mum, who was very upset.

However, during the days after my nan‚Äôs death, my mum seemed OK and it was clear a burden had lifted.

I saw her on the Wednesday and we went for coffee. She held my youngest baby boy who is 4 months old. She was having some issues with differing opinions between her and her sisters on which songs to choose for nan‚Äôs funeral so I suggested setting up a WhatsApp group between the 3 of them so that everyone was included in any communications, and to make things easier. She seemed to like this idea and I was happy to be able to help.

On Friday evening, I received a call from my sister to say my mum was having a suspected stroke so I drove to my mum‚Äôs house as quickly as I could. The ambulance service had severe wait times and despite her being already unresponsive, they said they would not be likely to get there within an hour. So I called my sister and told her we would need to get her in the car and take her to A&E.

When I arrived at my mum‚Äôs house, I saw my sister and brother-in-law carrying her out of the house and at that point I knew it was not looking good - she was completely limp. I told her I was here and that I loved her but it was clear that she was not able to communicate.
Once we got her to the hospital, they took her to resus. An hour later they came to tell us she had had a major bleed on the brain and that she would either die or be left with a severe neurological deficit.

Two days later, they turned off the life support.
I loved my mum and I can only hope she knew just how much. I think I often didn‚Äôt show it well enough. I found out that at the time of the haemorrhage, she had been messaging her sisters about the funeral songs for my nan. They had a disagreement and she ended up on the phone to one of the sisters. At that point, she said she thought she was having a stroke and the line went dead.

I am struggling with the fact that I set up the group and this may have precipitated her death.
I just want to give her one last hug, kiss her and tell her how much I love her.

I have 3 kids and it has been a struggle finding time to spend time quality time together over the last few years. We were planning on going on holiday in the next few months and it hurts so much that I won‚Äôt see her again and my boys won‚Äôt have their nanny as they grow up. She was the most caring, loving person in my world, and everything just feels so unfair and hostile now that she has been taken away. 

I‚Äôm really struggling to process this loss. I‚Äôm feeling guilt that I didn‚Äôt help her more during what was a stressful time for her. Guilt that I didn‚Äôt show her how much I love her. Sadness that I can‚Äôt just pick up the phone and talk to her. She was so beautiful, so caring and kind.

From the tone poet description of how this album came about: 

‚ÄúRecorded in the wee hours of Good Friday 1960, this charming and impromptu Pacific Jazz session captured the easygoing alchemy of The Modest Jazz Trio featuring Jim Hall on guitar, Red Mitchell on piano, and Red Kelly on bass. Good Friday Blues would be the trio's sole album, a sublimely swinging date that did indeed begin with the modest expectations of capturing a single track for a blues anthology that Richard Bock was producing.

But the vibe was right, the trio was inspired, the music flowed, and by morning they had laid down six tracks including a pair of originals by Mitchell and renditions of songbook standards including ""Willow Weep For Me,"" ""I Remember You,"" and ""I Was Doin' Alright."" The drum-less setting allows Hall's gorgeous, subtle tone and melodic flow to shine while Mitchell ‚Äî who was primarily known as a bassist ‚Äî surprises with his impressive piano chops, and Kelly provides  a sturdy base.‚Äù
