I’ve already applied to most places in Town Center (I live nearby), plus a few out at the beach and in San Marco. I’ve been calling and even stopping by in person, but haven’t been able to land an interview yet.

Thanks so much, Jacksonville. 🙏

1odg09p,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1odg09p/work_drama_when_your_hotel_life_starts_to_feel/,Work drama: When your hotel life starts to feel like a soap opera — need advice!,"Alright, buckle up, this is a bit of a saga. I’ve been in the hotel biz for about a decade now. Back in 2015, I started at a hotel that shared a parking lot with its “sister” property. In the same month I was hired, another woman—let’s call her Carla (45F)—was hired at the sister hotel. Over the years, we both climbed the ladder to front office supervisors and occasionally crossed paths, mostly friendly hellos and the usual “how’s your shift?” chats.

Fast forward a few years: I’m assistant manager at my hotel, and Carla had stepped down back to a desk associate role at her place. Our two hotels started working more closely together under the same GM—think joint holiday parties, staff mingling, the works. I met Carla’s husband Tim (45M), their two sons, her mom, her sister... basically the whole crew.

Eventually, Carla moved over to work at my hotel—right under my supervision—and even baked me Christmas cookies (which, FYI, instantly makes you a favorite). She met my kid, we became close-ish, and I trained her to be a front office supervisor/assistant manager. Tim often came by during Carla’s shifts. He’s a total people person—super friendly, the kind of guy who can chat about anything from the weather to why the coffee machine always breaks.

In early 2023, I got promoted to GM at another hotel in the company, while Carla stayed put. A couple months later, Tim asked if there were any front desk openings. Knowing he was great and seeing how sweet Carla was, I hired him—because hey, if the husband’s a good guy, that’s a win, right?

So here we are, present day. I’m AGM and Tim still works front desk. A few months ago, Tim confided that he and Carla have been having some trouble—separate bedrooms, her being distant, the classic “we’re having issues” stuff. Then this past weekend, I spot Tim out to dinner with Sally (28F), a coworker from Food & Beverage, and her family. When they noticed me waving, Tim looked like he’d seen a ghost and practically vanished.

Next thing I know, Tim texts me: “I bet that looked weird, huh?” He says he was just showing Sally’s family a good restaurant and asks me to keep it hush-hush. The very next day at work, Tim comes into my office and says Sally has been there for him when Carla hasn’t, and he’s been helping her out with some things. Then he asks if I think he’s giving off any “more than friends” vibes with Sally. I said no, but he asked again to keep this under wraps—especially from the GM.

So here I am, feeling like I’m in a soap opera but without the luxury of commercial breaks. It sounds sketchy, and honestly, I feel for Carla because nobody deserves to be blindsided. But is it my place to say anything? Tim and Sally work 4-5 shifts together every week. Do I tell the GM, or just keep my head down and hope this all blows over? I feel so awkward around both of them now.

What would you do? Because honestly, I’m torn between “mind your business” and “someone’s gotta say something.”",1,1761156933.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

Remember when “woke” was the magic word that let you dismiss anything from coffee cups to climate science without engaging with a single substantive point? 

Well, good news! 

We’ve got a shiny new replacement, and it’s even lazier: “AI slop.”

**The Formula Is Simple:**

1.Encounter information you don’t like

2.Squint really hard at it

3.Declare it “AI slop”

4.Congratulations! You’ve won the argument without making one

It’s the intellectual equivalent of a toddler covering their ears and going “LA LA LA I CAN’T HEAR YOU,” except the toddler has a Reddit account and a strong opinion about training data.

The Beauty of “AI Slop” As a Debate Tactic
What makes this phrase so chef’s kiss perfect is its unfalsifiability. Is it actually generated by AI? Doesn’t matter! Does it feel like something AI might generate? Close enough! Did a human write it but use words you associate with AI? 

SLOP DETECTED!

It’s Schrödinger’s content: simultaneously human-written when it’s convenient and AI-generated when it’s not. The person yelling “AI slop!” gets to be the arbiter of reality without providing a shred of evidence. How liberating!

Why Engage With Arguments When You Can Just Vibes-Check Them?


**Here’s the thing about actual counterarguments:** 

they’re hard. You have to read things, understand them, formulate responses, cite sources—exhausting! But “AI slop”? That’s a two-word spell that banishes uncomfortable facts back to the digital realm from whence they came.

-Cited statistics you don’t like? AI slop.

-Well-researched article that contradicts your priors? AI slop.

-Someone used the word “delve”? Definitely AI slop.

-Proper grammar and punctuation? Suspicious. Probably AI slop.

**The “Woke” Cinematic Universe Expands**

The lineage is clear:

-2015: “That’s just PC culture!”

-2018: “Everything is woke now!”

-2023: “This is DEI nonsense!”

-2025: “AI SLOP!”

Each iteration gets vaguer and more vibes-based. We’re three years away from people just making dial-up modem sounds when they encounter facts they dislike.

**How To Spot A Genuine “AI Slop” Accusation**

You know it’s a real bad-faith deployment when:

-It’s the person’s entire response to a 2,000-word researched piece

-They provide zero evidence for their claim

-They’ve never actually asked if AI was involved

The same person has used “woke,” “narrative,” and “MSM” in their last five comments

-They’re very concerned about authenticity but have never fact-checked anything in their life

**The Ultimate Irony**

The funniest part? Many of these brave truth-seekers are also convinced AI is going to achieve superintelligence next Tuesday and solve all of humanity’s problems. So which is it? Is AI an all-powerful god or is it only capable of producing “slop”?

Schrödinger’s neural network strikes again.
In Conclusion

Look, AI-generated misinformation is a real concern. But if your first and only response to inconvenient information is to scream “AI slop!” without engaging with the actual content, you’re not a critical thinker. 

You’re just doing the 2025 version of sticking your fingers in your ears.

And honestly? That’s pretty cringe. Or should I say… pretty slop.

Was this article written by AI? Who knows! Who cares! If you agree with it, it’s definitely human. 

If you disagree, it’s definitely slop. That’s how this works now, apparently.",0,1761156764.0,CanadianPostalService,0,0.5,False
1odfwzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoDigitalOppression/comments/1odfwzt/the_neofeudal_trap_digital_id_carbon_scores_and/,"The Neo-Feudal Trap: Digital ID, Carbon Scores, and the Future of ""Owning Nothing""","​My last post focused on how modern work demands more of our time than medieval life. But let's look forward: the real threat to freedom isn't just the sheer number of hours we work, but the impending shift from selling time to total behavioral compliance—a system of digital control that turns us all into perpetual tenants.

​This isn't just a slippery slope; it's the convergence of several powerful economic and political trends creating a new, ironclad cage:

​The Death of Ownership (The Subscription Tax)
=====

​The shift from ownership to access is the economic foundation of this ""Neo-Feudal"" model.

* **​Software and Media**: We no longer buy a piece of software (like Photoshop) or a game; we buy a temporary license. Streaming services (Netflix, Spotify) abolish physical media and one-time purchases, ensuring you must pay monthly, forever, just to access your past viewing habits. When you stop paying, everything you ""purchased"" or saved—from cloud backups to software projects—vanishes.

* **​The Home and Appliances**: The trend popularized by the World Economic Forum phrase, ""You'll own nothing and be happy,"" points to a future where homes are rented from institutional landlords, and even appliances (fridges, washers, tools) are leased services (""FridgeFlix""). The worker owns no capital (labor tools, land), and now, they won't even own their domestic infrastructure.

* **​The Problem**: This creates perpetual financial dependency. Your entire baseline quality of life—entertainment, productivity, domestic comfort—requires an expanding, mandatory array of subscription fees, tethering your livelihood inextricably to a consistent wage. If your income stops, your life digitally switches off almost instantly.

​The Enforcement Mechanism (ID + Cashless + Carbon Score)
=====

​If the subscription economy is the lock, the combination of mandatory Digital ID, cashless payment systems, and carbon tracking is the key to universal, non-negotiable compliance.


* **​Cashless Control**: The abolishing of physical currency means every single transaction—from buying a coffee to paying rent—is recorded, traceable, and linked to your identity. Financial privacy is eliminated.

* **​Digital ID and Centralized Monitoring**: A mandatory Digital ID becomes the ""front door"" to services, employment, and banking. This ID is the central node that allows authorities to link your digital identity to:
1. ​Your financial transactions (via the cashless system).
2. ​Your mobility and travel.
3. ​And, most critically, your Carbon Footprint Score.


* **​The Carbon Allowance Cage**: Hypothetically, a future where every citizen is assigned a Personal Carbon Allowance (PCA) becomes the ultimate control mechanism. Since all transactions are tracked (cashless) and tied to your identity (Digital ID), non-essential ""high-carbon"" purchases (a plane ticket, an expensive steak dinner, large home renovations) could be disallowed or penalized by simply having your purchase request denied based on your remaining allowance.


​The New Wage Slavery
=====


​The medieval peasant was tied to the land by law and subsistence farming. The Neo-Feudal worker is tied to the wage by access and compliance.

* **​The Rich Own the Digital Gates**: The wealthy own the capital (the streaming platforms, the cloud servers, the rental properties, the digital infrastructure). Everyone else is merely a user, perpetually paying rent for the essentials of modern life.

* **​Wages Buy Compliance**: In this system, the wage doesn't just buy sustenance; it buys the privilege to comply. You work not only to cover the housing rent but also the ""rent"" for your car's operating software, your creative tools, and your children's educational platform licenses. The wage keeps your digital privileges—and access to necessary services—activated.

* **​The Surveillance State is the Market**: Unlike the feudal lord who only cared about his cut of the harvest, this integrated digital system cares about everything you do, ensuring maximum compliance with both economic (pay the subscription!) and regulatory (stay within your PCA!) mandates.


​This is the ultimate evolution of ""owning nothing"": a world where your access to a basic standard of living is conditional on your continuous employment and perfect digital behavior.

​What specific steps can be taken to protect digital ownership and financial anonymity before this system becomes irreversible?

Yeah so, quitting caffeine is something that has been on the back of my mind for a couple of months now. It has become more prominent recently as I’ve realized that I’m spending anywhere from $6-$10+ every single day on energy drinks, 5 hours, coffee, etc. 

I’ve become a lot more aware of the nasty side effects this stuff has. One in particular is the suppressed appetite that it causes. I’m already generally a skinny dude, but since I’ve started body building, eating has become a serious chore and most of the time I don’t even want to eat period when I’ve had all this caffeine that day.

So, I’m ready to quit for good. But I’m a little afraid of the withdrawals, laziness, brain fog, etc that comes with it. So I’m going with a taper plan. I’m going to taper over a period of 3 weeks, then quit entirely.

However, I am spending around $80 a month on espresso from local coffee shops, and I would like to find a way to cut this expense. When I went to research espresso machines, it seemed that the general consensus was that if you’re not willing to spend $500 up front, you’re not going to get a decent espresso machine. I get that it would pay for itself in 8-10 months with my rampant espresso habit, but this is still more than I can justify on one purchase.

There is a number of stories of what happens to many of us and others that depend on a support system and when it dies. And anyone who says the state widely takes care of it's disabled, well there is more than enough showing they are flat out lying almost world wide.

  
I think it isn't talked about enough about the fear of many parents with autistic kids/adults that depend on them, and what happens after the parent dies. And in many cases if you listen to the stories there isn't anything. Likely not because the parent just didn't. But because there really isn't a solution. And sometimes, when they do set something up, it quickly falls through.

  
There was one story where a guy worked at some place (I forgot what they did, or maybe I was never told that bit), he hired his autistic adult son as an assistant. The son would get the entire team what they needed (coffee, paper, etc) and he would help out how he could. The dad died, and the company next week told the son there is no place for him at the company. If I remember right the son ended up quickly going homeless and dying some short time later.

My husband and I had been trying for a kid for two years. Nothing worked. The doctors said it was my tubes, basically destroyed from an infection I got in college. Surgery could maybe fix it, but insurance wouldn't cover it. We were looking at 35k minimum. My husband wanted to save up, do it right, maybe in another year or two.

But my ex called me out of nowhere last spring. We dated for six years before I met my husband. He was my first everything. We broke up because he wasn't ready to settle down, and I was tired of waiting. He said he made a mistake. Said he never stopped thinking about me. Said he was ready now.

I told him I was married. He said he knew. He asked if I was happy.

I wasn't. My husband worked all the time. We barely talked anymore. Our whole relationship had become about my broken body and whether we'd ever have kids. I felt like a failure every single day.

My ex and I started meeting for coffee. Then lunch. Then I was lying about girls' nights and going to his apartment. It happened so fast. One night turned into two months of sneaking around, and I felt alive again. He made me feel wanted, not like some defective wife who couldn't do the one thing women are supposed to do.

Then he said something that changed everything. He said, ""If things were different, I'd want to have a baby with you.""

And I just, I lost it. I cried in his car for an hour. Because here was this man who wanted me, wanted a future with me, and I couldn't even give him that because my body was trash.

He held me and said, ""What if we found a way?""

I should have left right then. I should have gone home and confessed everything to my husband. But I didn't. Instead, I started researching. I found a clinic two states over that specialized in high-risk fertility cases. They said they could do a combination of surgical repair and IVF. The success rate wasn't great, but it was a chance.

It cost 40k. I emptied my personal savings. I lied and said it was for my mom's medical bills. My husband didn't question it because my mom's been sick for years anyway.

The surgery was three weeks ago. They repaired what they could and immediately started me on hormones for the IVF cycle. My ex provided his sample. The embryo transfer was yesterday.

I told my husband I was visiting my college roommate. I came home last night sore and exhausted. He was making dinner when I walked in, being sweet and asking how my trip was.

This morning, he was waiting for me in the kitchen with printed bank statements spread across the table.

He said, ""You want to explain why 40 grand went to a fertility clinic in Nebraska when you told me it was for your mother?""

I froze. I tried to lie. I said I wanted to surprise him.

He said, ""Surprise me with what? The paperwork says the procedure was done two days ago and you were there alone. What the hell did you do?""

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. And the words just came out. I told him everything. The affair. The baby. The surgery. All of it.

His face went completely blank. He didn't yell. He didn't cry. He just stood up, walked to our bedroom, and started packing a bag.

I followed him, begging. I said, ""Please, I made a mistake. I was confused. I felt so worthless and he made me feel like I mattered.""

He stopped packing and turned to look at me. His voice was so quiet. He said, ""You spent our money. You had surgery to carry another man's baby. You planned this for months. And you're calling it a mistake?""

I tried to grab his arm. He pulled away like I'd burned him.

He said, ""I loved you through every failed pregnancy test. Every doctor's appointment. Every night you cried yourself to sleep. I would have waited forever. I would have adopted. I would have done anything. And you did this.""

He left. That was eight hours ago. His lawyer already emailed me divorce papers. His mother called me a whore and said she's telling everyone at church what I did. My own parents won't answer my phone.

I'm sitting here possibly pregnant with my ex's baby, about to lose everything, and I can't stop shaking. My ex won't return my calls either. I think he got scared when I told him my husband knew.

The clinic called to schedule my follow-up appointment. They asked if my husband would be coming with me for support during the two week wait.

I just hung up.

So after everything I've destroyed, am I the one who's actually in the wrong here?

1odfm7n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odfm7n,Surprising skunk spray tip,"Hi all,

One of my pups was sprayed in the face last night by a skunk - poor baby was drooling, eye swollen closed, and of course, the smell was insane. I didn’t know that up close it has a crazy “chemical” edge vs the weed/pot smell you get when driving by a dead skunk. 

Anyway, this happened to my mom’s dog a few months ago and the only thing I had on hand nearby to try were WaterWipes sensitive baby wipes that were recommended for use in our car. I grabbed those again and rubbed him down with multiple wipes. 

I’m not a rep and don’t own stock, I’m
just honestly blown away by how effective they are given the horror stories people have shared here (and elsewhere) about how long the smell will last on their pet - even after using the “best” method of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and Dawn. Days, weeks, even months! Makes no sense given oil and water but I can not deny the amazing effect. 

You could see the yellow oil coming off (see pics) and after multiple wipes -  and JUST wipes, no bath - the smell was super faint. As in, face up against his to be able to still smell it faintly. 

Unfortunately it’s now my house that reeks from bringing him into the bathroom to cleanup (not ideal but I was panicking given the surprise and his awful condition). Going to try the vinegar bowls and coffee grounds for that. Fingers crossed…

Anyway, if you live near skunks, I highly recommend you get some to try; worst case if you don’t need them for skunk, they are safe for your car’s dashboard and vegan seats (and baby’s butts). I haven’t seen them locally but found them on Amazon. 

And if you use them, please comment so others see the positive effect (otherwise I know it sounds far fetched). I just want to help anyone else in this nasty situation. ",1,1761156066.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

1odfk10,https://i.redd.it/zayr64qecpwf1.jpeg,"Bad diet with a hectic schedule may cause diabetes — sounds bad, right?","Ever wondered how a hectic workday and “grab-anything” meals are silently reshaping your health? It’s no secret — the fast-paced lifestyle of Pune’s corporate crowd is fueling one of the most common health threats of this generation: **Type 2 Diabetes**. Sounds bad, doesn’t it? But the reality is worse — because most people don’t even realize it’s happening until it’s too late.

With long hours, stress, and irregular eating habits becoming the norm, the need to consult a [Diabetologist near me](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG) is higher than ever. And understanding this connection early can literally change the course of your health journey.

# Why Your Busy Schedule Is Fueling Diabetes

In the rush of work deadlines, meetings, and traffic, food often becomes a last priority. Most professionals skip breakfast, eat oily snacks, and rely on caffeine to stay awake — a dangerous cycle that spikes blood sugar and disrupts metabolism.

# 1. Skipping Meals and Overeating Later

When you skip meals, your blood sugar drops, forcing your body to crave sugar-heavy foods later. This sudden spike and crash pattern leads to **insulin resistance**, one of the main causes of diabetes.

# 2. Processed Food Dependency

Quick bites like vada pavs, sandwiches, or instant noodles fill the stomach but flood the body with carbs, preservatives, and unhealthy fats — putting extra pressure on your pancreas.

# 3. Constant Stress

Workplace stress releases cortisol, a hormone that triggers sugar buildup in the bloodstream, gradually pushing you toward **Type 2 Diabetes**.

# 4. Lack of Physical Activity

Sitting for 8–10 hours a day slows down metabolism. Combine that with poor eating habits, and you have the perfect setup for long-term glucose imbalance.

# Dr. Satish Gupta Explains — The Urban Connection Between Lifestyle and Diabetes

According to **Dr. Satish Gupta**, a renowned **Diabetologist in Pune**, diabetes cases among working professionals are skyrocketing — especially in areas like Aundh, Baner, Pashan, Wakad, Balewadi, Pimpri-Saudagar, and Bhavdhan.

He explains that modern work routines have completely changed how people eat, rest, and move. From skipping breakfast to late-night dinners, every wrong choice adds up. In his words, *“Diabetes doesn’t happen overnight; it’s built meal by meal, habit by habit.”*

With **over 10 years of experience** and a reputation for his precise diagnosis and lifestyle-based management approach, Dr. Gupta has helped countless patients manage diabetes effectively through personalized diet plans, early detection, and continuous monitoring. His guidance focuses on creating sustainable habits — not quick fixes.

# Early Signs You Should Never Ignore

Catching diabetes early can prevent long-term complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Watch out for these subtle symptoms:

* Unusual fatigue even after proper rest
* Increased thirst and frequent urination
* Sudden weight loss or gain
* Blurred vision
* Slow-healing wounds or frequent infections

# Common Dietary Habits That Are Raising Blood Sugar

Pune locals often love their flavorful food — but what seems tasty might be quietly harmful. Here are common culprits behind rising diabetes cases:

# 1. Excessive Sugar in Tea and Coffee

Multiple cups of chai or coffee with added sugar contribute to constant glucose overload.

# 2. Street Snacks and Refined Carbs

Popular items like samosas, misal pav, and bakery goods are rich in trans fats and refined flour — bad news for insulin function.

# 3. Late Dinners and Heavy Meals

Late-night eating slows digestion, keeping sugar levels elevated through the night.

# 4. Sweetened Drinks

Packaged fruit juices, colas, and energy drinks spike sugar faster than you’d expect.

# 5. Low Water Intake

Dehydration can increase glucose concentration in the blood, worsening diabetes symptoms.

# The Hidden Triggers — Beyond Just Food

Diabetes is not just about sugar; it’s about **how your body handles stress, rest, and lifestyle habits.**

# 1. Poor Sleep Patterns

Less than 6 hours of quality sleep can disrupt insulin production and cause hormonal imbalance.

# 2. Sedentary Lifestyle

Not walking enough between work hours or relying too much on elevators builds fat around the abdomen — a major risk factor.

# 3. Overdependence on Caffeine

Excess coffee intake not only spikes cortisol levels but also interferes with glucose regulation.

# 4. Ignoring Regular Checkups

Many people in their 30s and 40s assume diabetes only hits the elderly — a myth that delays detection.

# Smart Ways to Manage or Prevent Diabetes

You don’t need a complete lifestyle overhaul — just consistent small changes. Here’s a guide to keeping diabetes away:

# 1. Eat on Time

Follow a meal schedule. Include fiber-rich foods, whole grains, and protein to maintain steady blood sugar.

# 2. Move Every Hour

Stand, stretch, or walk every 45 minutes during work hours to improve metabolism.

# 3. Track Your Sugar

Regular monitoring helps you understand how your daily choices impact blood glucose.

# 4. Manage Stress

Simple breathing exercises, short breaks, or evening walks can regulate cortisol levels.

# 5. Prioritize Sleep

A good 7–8 hours of rest is crucial for healthy hormone balance and glucose metabolism.

# 6. Regular Checkups

Early detection through regular blood tests and professional consultation can prevent major complications later.

# When to Visit a Diabetologist

If you’re already showing signs of tiredness, high thirst, or frequent urination, it’s time to see a Diabetologist. [Dr. Satish Gupta](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG) provides comprehensive diabetes management plans — from nutrition counseling to modern glucose monitoring techniques — all under one roof.

Known for his expertise in lifestyle-related diabetes cases, he emphasizes prevention, not just treatment. His personalized approach helps patients across Pune — including Aundh, Baner, Pashan, Balewadi, Pimpri-Nilakh, and Wakad — regain control over their health with evidence-based, practical solutions.

In today’s fast-moving world, diabetes has quietly become the “price of convenience.” Busy schedules, irregular meals, and stress are shaping a silent epidemic — especially among Pune’s working population.

But here’s the good news — *diabetes is preventable and manageable* when you act early. So, instead of waiting for symptoms to hit hard, make a proactive choice today. Small steps like mindful eating, movement, and timely checkups can make all the difference.",2,1761155941.0,Healthandlifetips,1,1.0,False

1odfifx,https://i.redd.it/oo0d0bsecpwf1.jpeg,No More Dhoom: Ayan Mukerji Returns to His Astraverse,"Ayan Mukerji has parted ways with Dhoom 4 due to creative differences, choosing instead to focus on his upcoming project, Brahmāstra: Part Two – Dev. I believe this was indeed a brave decision. The Dhoom franchise, known for its high-octane action and stylized storytelling, is not his forte.

If we look at his filmography, Ayan has directed films like Wake Up Sid and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, which are coming-of-age romantic dramas that many of us strongly resonated with. Later, he shifted to his dream project Brahmāstra, which received backlash. This year, he ventured into the YRF Spy Universe with War 2, an action thriller that also attracted significant negativity.

It’s clear that action and masala films are not his cup of coffee. He should stick to his roots and focus on films that explore themes like coming-of-age, self-discovery, love, and identity. However, if he still wants to pursue Brahmāstra, he must understand what didn’t work in the first part and make necessary improvements to the script.

**Why Didn’t Brahmāstra Work? What Were the Flaws?**

Weak Storytelling and Screenplay, Cringeworthy Dialogues, Underdeveloped Characters and Lack of Chemistry, Wasted Cameos and Overemphasis on VFX.

**What Should Ayan Mukerji Do to Make Things Right?**

He should prioritize scripting and storytelling. For Brahmāstra: Part One, the dialogues were written by Hussain Dalal, who received significant criticism. According to reports, Ayan is now bringing in Rajat Arora as the dialogue writer. Rajat is known for his punchy, mass-appeal dialogues in films such as: Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Kick, The Dirty Picture, Gabbar Is Back.

 While Rajat Arora brings a commercial flair, I believe **Prakash Kapadia** would be a better fit for **Brahmāstra: Part Two – Dev**, especially if Ayan wants to elevate the mythological and emotional depth of the film. Kapadia is renowned for his work in Devdas, Padmaavat, and Bajirao Mastani, which beautifully blend grandeur with emotional storytelling.

1odfi02,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1odfi02/amen_before_we_even_begin/,Amen Before We Even Begin,"Amen Before We Even Begin

There is a hush,
a soft inhalation of the world
before sunlight sketches itself across the hills.
We fold our hands in the silence
and say Amen
to the small miracle of waking,
to the breath trembling in the chest
like a moth testing the warmth of a windowpane.

We do not wait for perfection.
We step with unsteady feet into the vast cathedral of morning,
each heartbeat a bell, each thought a flicker
of light along worn stone.
Even the dew, heavy and trembling,
seems to whisper: here, here, begin here.

I have watched the wind arrange itself in the trees,
seen rivers bow beneath their own clarity,
and in this quiet reckoning
I understand that to bless is not to claim,
but to notice, to let the pulse of the universe
coax you forward,
even when the path is only a suggestion,
a song half-formed.

Amen is a seed.
Amen is the first sip of coffee, bitter and warm,
that reminds the tongue of possibility.
It is the glance shared with a stranger,
the sudden understanding
that the day does not wait,
but bends toward those willing
to meet it,
to hold it in the palms of their hands
as if holding fire,
as if holding rain.

So we begin.
Not with certainty,
not with a map,
but with the simple act of breathing,
of saying yes to this unfolding moment,
of acknowledging
that before the first step,
before the first word,
there is Amen.",1,1761155818.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Here's the backstory: I (27M) met her (25F) on a dating app last December. We went on three dates that I thought went well, but she said she didn't see us going anywhere romantically “at the moment”. Since then, we've hung out as friends, mostly going to movies or getting coffee, and it's been a lot of fun. We haven't talked about whether either of our feelings have changed.

I recently reactivated my dating profile and noticed her profile now says she's ""looking for hookups or an FWB."" I was surprised by this change and wondered if it's worth bringing up.

To be clear, while we're good friends emotionally, I don't think I have romantic feelings for her anymore. However, I'm still physically attracted to her.

If I bring this up, I'm ready for things to potentially get awkward for a bit. I plan to respect her decision no matter what, even if she's not totally against the idea, but still doesn't think it's a good move. Our friendship is important to me, and I don't want to ruin it based on what happens.

1odffow,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1odffow/whats_the_best_or_most_underrated_town_square_in/,💬 What’s the best (or most underrated) town square in Ireland?,"Hey folks, bit of a random one. I’m a student who loves exploring Irish towns, but after a fair few road trips, I’ve realised we’ve loads of lovely streets but hardly any proper squares. Am I missing a gem somewhere?

I’ve travelled a bit around Europe and always loved their town squares, ye know, the ones surrounded by cafés and shops where people just sit around chatting and watching the world go by. But here in Ireland, most towns have gorgeous little lanes and colourful streets instead of that one central square. Don’t get me wrong, still class altogether, but it got me wondering — are there any Irish towns with a proper lively square that feels like the heart of the place?

For me, a good square should have cafés or shops with outdoor seating, stone or brick paving (no tarmac please 😅), and ideally be pedestrian or car-free during the day. Somewhere with a nice human scale where ye’d actually want to sit for a while.

So far, here’s what I’ve seen:
☕ John Roberts Square, Waterford - Ticks all the boxes, lovely place to sit with a coffee on a fine day and watch the world go by.
🌳 Eyre Square, Galway – Great buzz, but feels more like a park than a square.
⛪ Pearse Square, Cobh – Stunning cathedral view but too many cars.
🌊 Bantry Square – Unreal views of the harbour and mountains, but a bit too big and car-heavy.

I think spots like The Octagon in Westport, Donegal town centre, or Market Street in Carlingford could be amazing if they were pedestrianised.

Anyway, I haven’t been everywhere yet, so I’m asking ye — does your hometown have a nice square or space like that? Would love to check it out on my next wander.

And sure look, these are just my own thoughts, no offence meant to anyone’s hometown. Every Irish town has its own charm, and I love them all for different reasons.

1odffjf,https://i.redd.it/x29c30kybpwf1.jpeg,Driving from FL to CA with a cat and a dog!,"HI all, I appreciate all advice. My husband and I are moving from Florida to California on October 29th. We will have a packed SUV with a dog and a cat. Neither animal has traveled long distances in a vehicle before.

I am figuring on around 6-7 hours of driving (with bathroom stops) a day because Penelope meows the entire time she is in the car. I hoping she eventually falls asleep, but there are obviously no guarantees. I do have Gabapentin my vet gave us in case she freaks.

I've driven cross country before, but never with a cat. I know to bring her litter box (kept in a plastic bag), food, water, toys, treats, and her cat scratcher. Anything else? Lillian our sweet doggie is okay, but gets car sick, so we're prepared for that. We are not pulling anything behind our vehicle.

Any route suggestions, anything to avoid, hotels to stay in, any tips to help us prepare? We are planning on a 6 day trip, but if we can get the cat settled, we can drive much longer stretches at a time.

We're driving to Woodland Hills right outside of LA. We're hoping to start right after traffic hour and end right before the next traffic hour starts. 

Thanks everyone! Lots of stress here. =(",2,1761155666.0,roadtrip,0,1.0,False

I just booted up my PC after two days off and I can't get into BIOS. Built the PC 7 months ago and have been monitoring the asrock 9800x3d failure posts and upgrading the BIOS over time. Not sure what version I'm on now though. Right now all the internal RGB in the build illuminates on boot but all my screens are black and I have a red CPU light on the mobo. No other indicator lights. I was just running battlefield 6 flawlessly all weekend, and then the computer was off for the last two days. Have not noticed any issues with the computer prior to this point, and have had the computer in sleep mode and or fully shut down regularly with no noticeable issues. No overclocks on anything and the only settings I changed in bios were the setting recommended on threads I found here when I was first reading about these issues. I have yet to fully run through the gauntlet of troubleshooting as I need to get my coffee in me first.

My question is, what is the general consensus on the next steps at this point assuming my CPU is dead? 

I'm reading that RMA for AMD is a breeze and I can get a new CPU relatively quickly, but ASRock RMA can take 7 weeks or more. After just dropping $70 for BF6 for the sole purpose  of hitting that launch window hype, 7 weeks without a gaming PC is far from ideal. Furthermore, I don't even know if I want to keep an ASRock board if this failure issue has yet to be definitely solved. What options are available to me? Having purchased the items through microcenter, but without any type of additional warranty, has anyone had any luck going through them? Has anyone had any luck getting a refund from ASRock instead of a replacement? This is frankly rediculous and if the only option available to me is hours of troubleshooting and hurdles to jump through only to get another board shipped to me that could potentially fry another CPU... Im wondering when I can sign up for a class action lawsuit.",2,1761155584.0,ASRock,3,1.0,False

1odfe3l,https://i.redd.it/kxkwviujbpwf1.jpeg,No More Dhoom: Ayan Mukerji Returns to His Astraverse,"Ayan Mukerji has parted ways with Dhoom 4 due to creative differences, choosing instead to focus on his upcoming project, Brahmāstra: Part Two – Dev. I believe this was indeed a brave decision. The Dhoom franchise, known for its high-octane action and stylized storytelling, is not his forte.

If we look at his filmography, Ayan has directed films like Wake Up Sid and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, which are coming-of-age romantic dramas that many of us strongly resonated with. Later, he shifted to his dream project Brahmāstra, which received backlash. This year, he ventured into the YRF Spy Universe with War 2, an action thriller that also attracted significant negativity.

It’s clear that action and masala films are not his cup of coffee. He should stick to his roots and focus on films that explore themes like coming-of-age, self-discovery, love, and identity. However, if he still wants to pursue Brahmāstra, he must understand what didn’t work in the first part and make necessary improvements to the script.

**Why Didn’t Brahmāstra Work? What Were the Flaws?**

Weak Storytelling and Screenplay, Cringeworthy Dialogues, Underdeveloped Characters and Lack of Chemistry, Wasted Cameos and Overemphasis on VFX.

**What Should Ayan Mukerji Do to Make Things Right?**

He should prioritize scripting and storytelling. For Brahmāstra: Part One, the dialogues were written by Hussain Dalal, who received significant criticism. According to reports, Ayan is now bringing in Rajat Arora as the dialogue writer. Rajat is known for his punchy, mass-appeal dialogues in films such as: Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Kick, The Dirty Picture, Gabbar Is Back.

 While Rajat Arora brings a commercial flair, I believe **Prakash Kapadia** would be a better fit for **Brahmāstra: Part Two – Dev**, especially if Ayan wants to elevate the mythological and emotional depth of the film. Kapadia is renowned for his work in Devdas, Padmaavat, and Bajirao Mastani, which beautifully blend grandeur with emotional storytelling.

Well, last Friday I was multitasking like a maniac on a Zoom call, sipping cold coffee, and trying to get this new ""Work From Home Security Policy"" out before the weekend.

At the same time, I had a chat going with my friend from another department. She had just sent me this *glorious* image of a raccoon wearing a tiny tuxedo and top hat, holding a cocktail glass, with the caption “When you log into Zoom and realize your camera is on.”

Anyway. I download the PDF of the policy. I also download the raccoon image because obviously, I needed to save that. And somehow, in my extremely caffeinated and distracted state, I attached **the raccoon** to the email instead of the policy doc.

Did I double-check before hitting “send to all”? Of course not. I'm a professional.

Cue 200+ people receiving an email with the subject line:  
**“IMPORTANT: Updated Work From Home Security Policy”**  
… and opening it to find a raccoon in formal wear looking dapper as hell.

My inbox IMMEDIATELY blew up with replies like:

“This policy is a little more fashionable than I expected.”

“Do I need to dress like this for remote work now?”

“Best HR communication ever. 10/10.”

My boss slacked me:

“Please send the correct file… but honestly, this made my day.”

So yeah. Sent the correct file 5 minutes later, subject line:

It feels daunting but I gotta get rid of this thing. I'm out of school 4 years with 1 year of internship and 3 years of Big Girl salary so made the decision to stop wasting time with all of the horrible changes (they are cutting my PAYE plan next year and I'd have to pick a plan more costly in the long run) to the loan situation in the US and this thing growing and growing in interest.

1odf47z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1odf47z/two_story_barndominium_floor_plans/,Two Story Barndominium Floor Plans,"Innovative Features of Two Story Barndominium Floor Plans
---------------------------------------------------------

Two story barndominiums are gaining popularity for their unique charm and versatile design. These structures blend the rustic appeal of barns with modern living spaces, making them ideal for families and individuals alike. One of the strongest selling points of two story barndominium floor plans is their innovative features, which maximize space and enhance functionality.

### Open Concept Living

Many two story barndominiums emphasize open concept living. This layout removes barriers between the kitchen, dining, and living areas, creating a welcoming environment. Such designs promote family interaction and make entertaining guests easier. Large windows allow natural light to flood the space, making the interior feel larger and brighter.

### Flexible Space Use

One of the most innovative aspects of two story barndominiums is flexible space usage. Homeowners can customize their designs to suit their lifestyles. For instance:

- **Home Office:** With remote work becoming more common, many choose to incorporate a home office into their plans, taking advantage of the spacious upper floor.
- **Guest Suite:** The upper floor can serve as a dedicated guest suite, providing privacy for visitors while keeping them close to the rest of the family.
- **Playroom:** Families with young children may convert part of the second floor into a playroom, keeping toys contained in a specific area.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Storage can often be a challenge in traditional homes. However, barndominiums tackle this issue head-on with clever designs. Utilizing the vertical space of two stories allows for:

- **Built-in Shelving:** Walls can be outfitted with built-in shelves to display books and decor, keeping the space organized.
- **Under-Stair Storage:** The area under the stairs can serve as a small closet or a cozy nook for kid’s activities.
- **Attic Space:** Some floor plans take advantage of the height of the building by incorporating an attic for additional storage.

### Outdoor Living Areas

Connecting with nature is a key component of barndominium life. Two story floor plans often include outdoor living spaces such as balconies and large patios. These areas enhance your living experience by allowing you to enjoy the outdoors right from your home. Whether you want to sip coffee on a sunny morning or host a barbecue with friends, these spaces provide the perfect backdrop.

### Sustainable Design

As sustainability becomes more important, innovative two story barndominium plans often feature eco-friendly elements. Homeowners can integrate solar panels, efficient heating, and cooling systems, and rainwater harvesting setups. These features not only lower utility bills but also reduce the environmental impact of the home.

### Energy Efficiency

Modern two story barndominiums are typically built with energy-efficient materials and designs. This includes high-quality insulation, energy-efficient windows, and advanced HVAC systems. All these elements help to keep the home comfortable and can lead to significant energy savings over time.

### Customization Options

One of the greatest advantages of two story barndominiums is the level of customization available. Owners can select finishes, layouts, and features that fit their personal style. From rustic farmhouse aesthetics to sleek modern designs, each barndominium can reflect the owner's taste and preferences.

### Affordability and Space Utilization

Compared to traditional homes, two story barndominiums can be more affordable to build, especially as they often require fewer materials. The two-story format allows families to have a larger living space on a smaller footprint, which can also be more sustainable. This is particularly beneficial for those looking to maximize their budget while still achieving a spacious and functional living area.

The innovative features of two story barndominium floor plans present a perfect blend of style, practicality, and sustainability. With their unique charm and flexibility, they cater to a wide variety of lifestyles and personal needs, making them an attractive choice for modern homeowners.

Maximizing Space and Functionality in Multi-Level Barndominiums
---------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Multi-level barndominiums offer a unique blend of rustic charm and modern functionality, making them an appealing choice for many homeowners. The design allows you to maximize space creatively while retaining the essence of a cozy, inviting home. With the right strategies and layouts, two-story barndominiums can serve a variety of lifestyle needs without feeling cramped. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your multi-level barndominium.

### Open Concept Living Areas

One effective way to maximize space in a two-story barndominium is to adopt an open concept for your living areas. This design approach fosters a feeling of openness and fluidity throughout the space, making it a great option for smaller homes. Here are some key benefits:

- **Natural Light:** Large windows and minimal walls allow natural light to flood the space, making it feel larger.
- **Versatility:** Combine your kitchen, dining, and living spaces into a single area that is perfect for entertaining.
- **Flow:** An open layout ensures easy movement throughout the first floor, ideal for families or gatherings.

### Smart Use of Vertical Space

In a two-story barndominium, utilizing vertical space is essential. Consider the following strategies:

- **High Ceilings:** Opt for high ceilings to create a more expansive feeling as well as opportunities for tall storage solutions.
- **Loft Spaces:** Incorporate loft areas for additional sleeping quarters or office spaces, which can serve multiple functions depending on your needs.
- **Storage Solutions:** Use vertical shelves and built-ins to keep clutter at bay while maintaining easy access to your belongings.

### Functional Floor Plans

When selecting floor plans for your two-story barndominium, focus on functionality that suits your lifestyle. Here are some popular arrangements:

- **Open Kitchen to Living Space:** Positioning the kitchen near the living area can enhance family interactions and gatherings.
- **Separate Utility Areas:** Consider a designated laundry room on the second floor for convenience, especially if the bedrooms are upstairs.
- **Flexible Rooms:** Design rooms that can serve multiple purposes, such as guest bedrooms that double as an office or playroom.

### Consider Outdoor Spaces

Don’t forget to include outdoor areas in your multi-level design. Balconies and outdoor patios can extend your living space and provide areas for relaxation or entertainment. Here’s why outdoor integration is vital:

- **Improved Airflow:** Access to outdoor spaces can help create a connection with nature and improve your indoor air quality.
- **Views:** Utilize your two-story design to create stunning views from upper balconies or large windows.
- **Outdoor Activities:** By adding porches or patios, you have additional spaces for seasonal gatherings, barbecues, or simply enjoying your surroundings.

### Effective Zoning

Zoning your multi-level barndominium can significantly enhance functionality. By designating specific areas for living, sleeping, and entertaining, you can maintain a harmonious flow and reduce noise between spaces. Tips for effective zoning include:

- **Noise Control:** Place bedrooms away from common areas to ensure a quieter environment for sleeping.
- **Traffic Patterns:** Arrange rooms based on how you move through your home. Ensure there’s a logical flow from entrances to key living spaces.
- **Design Cohesion:** Keep a consistent design theme throughout your levels, using similar colors and materials to create unity.

Maximizing space and functionality in multi-level barndominiums requires careful planning and thoughtful design choices. Embrace open layouts, utilize vertical space, and consider zoning and outdoor areas to create a beautiful, functional home that meets your needs. With these strategies in mind, your two-story barndominium can truly shine as a well-organized and inviting space.

</div>### Conclusion

Two story barndominium floor plans offer a unique blend of innovative features and practical functionality that can transform your living space. By embracing open-concept designs, vaulted ceilings, and abundant natural light, you’re not just creating a home but a personalized sanctuary. These architecturally stunning structures blend farmhouse charm with modern comfort, allowing you to express your style while maximizing the available space.

One of the standout advantages of multi-level barndominiums is their ability to efficiently utilize vertical space. This layout allows for distinct areas for living, working, and relaxing. Whether you’re incorporating a cozy loft study, a spacious family area, or separate bedrooms, every inch of space can be optimized. By doing so, you can enjoy the comforts of home without sacrificing practicality or feeling cramped.

Furthermore, designing a two story barndominium encourages creativity in functionality. You can easily customize each floor to suit your lifestyle, whether it involves creating an expansive entertainment space downstairs or a serene master suite above. With numerous options available, you can tailor the layout to fit family needs and personal preferences.

Choosing a two story barndominium floor plan represents a smart investment in modern living while providing the charm and warmth of traditional architecture. The innovative features and the efficient use of space truly exemplify what it means to live in harmony with your surroundings. As you explore these unique designs, you’ll be on your way to creating a home that meets your needs and reflects your individual taste.",1,1761154980.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

However, over the past few years, there has been instances where she says or acts in a way that I find unnecessary especially since they’re manly in public. 

I suffer immensely from general and social anxiety so at times, I do or ask for certain things that has clashed with my sisters views. Here are a few examples:

On a recent flight we took to visit family, I had a large coffee while at the airport. During the flight, I had to use the bathroom so I asked her to get up as I was seated at the window. Rolling her eyes she yells out “this is why you don’t chug a huge coffee before a long flight!” while many passengers their heads to see. “You’re taking the aisle seat on the trip.” she said when I returned. 

At the grocery store, I try to look up a coupon I had on my phone while paying and my sister yells “forget the coupon. I’m not cheap and need to save $1 off ice cream. Geez.” while laughing. 

 Whenever I’m driving, she’s constantly telling me to go around slow drivers reasoning “we have stuff to do!”

If I ever argue back and tell her that she’s being a jerk, she just says “that’s just the way it is! Deal with it.” So I finally asked if she thinks she might have anger management issues and if she’s thought about seeking help. Of course she denies this and says I’m crazy to suggest this. I feel like anger management runs somewhat in the family as my cousin has severe anger management issues. 

Am I wrong for suggesting my sister seek anger management issues or am I being too sensitive over her jabs and comments? I once described her behavior as “you think you’re in a sitcom and everyone is waiting for you to make a snarky or funny comment.”",5,1761154910.0,amiwrong,1,1.0,False

I am a intermediate Spanish speaker. My gf (34f) has never been to Colombia.

 We both work in the restaurant world, so food is paramount. we want to enjoy a mix of fine dining and rustic local\\ street food. some of the choices for fine dining we are committed to, but most everything else was just fed to me by AI based on things ive enjoyed in the past or seem relevant to the area. 

Accommodations we are obviously doing a mix of hostel dorms and a few splurge private accommodations to make things more affordable. open to different suggestions of course. 

For activities, we both love nature/hiking/ the outdoors. Like I mentioned not huge on night life anymore.  We are not huge museum people, but def might check out the Botero museum as i really enjoy his art. We do however really enjoy street art, live music\\performances.  

We will be taking domestic flights when possible, between locations to save on time. I love taking busses in Colombia (...sometimes) but trying to maximize time.

First few paragraphs are context, current living situation. Under ""----"" it's the actual problem and vent. 

So, now. This is not your tipical ""oh no, he opensly hates her, look at his face"". Nothing like that. But why does it seem a relationship is something he is just forced to be in, instead of something he really wants? Why do I feel even farther away than not so close friends of his?

A bit of context. I recently started a job. It will only be 1 year, but it's a huge opportunity in my career. I wake up really f early, and with public transport, I spend 11 hours minimum outside home and no breaks. Half the day basically, if you don't include the sleeping hours which I only do 5 because I'm incapable of sleeping ealier. It's my first big job so yes, sorry for not enduring those ""14 hours"" some of you have...

Thing is, my boyfriend has the exact opposite schedule than me. When I get off work, he gets in (another workplace). We don't live together, and his off days doesn't align with mine (maybe once every one - two months). This means, only way I can see him rest of days is if I decide to stay at his house, to only see him half an hour when he arrives before I'm forced to sleep because it's 1 am. Virtually no time. And this planning, also means I'm the one constantly moving to his house, away from my morning routine staff (I have to plan clothes, products, even breakfast, coffee or thing I may need that he doesn't have). This also takes a load on me, you know, public transport.... It makes everything insufferable 

----

Anyways. My birthday was very recently. We managed to be together in the afternoon. It was a pretty lovely day, he was the first and only in the day to make me feel it was indeed my bd.
We wanted to eat in a particular place I was craving so bad for days. But it was closed, not biggie. Remember this


Last night, I managed to stay in his house while he was at work, to wake up early and go to my work. I was there after the SHITTIEST day at my office. It was really stressful, it was really bad, I'm new so there are things I don't yet now but seems as if  the rest forgot I'm new and... I don't know what they don't tell me. I needed a break. I don't get a break at my home. I texted him, told him everything, that I need him. That if doesn't matter he has to go to work and only see him when I'm supposed to be sleeping. I needed someoone that day.
When I arrived, 40 minutes before he had to leave, he spent half the time watching a tv series that has him really hooked up.  At night, I waited awake when I was supposed not to, just because I really needed a bit of his attention before waking up to go to my work. But when he arrived, he stayed at the living room because he didn't feel sleepy so he didn't want to disturb me with the mobile phone or tv (fair enough but... I felt alone, for that I was waiting him? To not be with him?)
Naturally, I didn't sleep until he decided to come back to bed, at that point I only had 4 hours before waking up. I woke up... really drained, really angry, and really.. betrayed? And still, he told me he didn't undertand why I was that way and why I was paying it with him (later I explained but... I feel there shouldn't have been an explanation, he should have known...?)

So, that was this morning. I arrived home pretty recently. I have noticed I don't disconnect from work at all. I got bored of all my hobbies, I don't have any friends left, and there are no activities in my area to make friends around my age and not 40 years older. And guess... yes, another bad day at work but that's okey at this point. So I decided to ring him up

I was willing to go over to near where he live, and have a date, eat dinner at the place we wanted in my birthday. That I really need to disconnect from work and since today it's his day off until next week, we could go
He told me he already made plans with friends tomorrow, and that they will go eat to the place he was going to propose them (BUT HE DIDN'T PROPOSED IT YET)... the same place I wanted to go but was closed in my birthday. So logically, ""we can't go dinner tonight"", maybe another day another place. But at this point I tell him to nevermind, I was not that hungry anyway...


I... I don't know I just feel so... isolated from everyone..? I'm not even around people my age at work, I'm directly working next to my boss so not small funny talk neither during work

I feel I'm exaggerating my feelings and it's not a big deal, my bf had other plans, it's not his fault the work schedule or that I don't have anyone else currently in my life

So yes. That's it. That's all. I hope when I press send, I feel a bit better than before the call, better than last night

1odexzl,https://i.redd.it/gxc6uigj8pwf1.jpeg,Why Are So Many Working Professionals Facing Bladder Control Problems? A Urologist in Pune Explains the Hidden Cause,"Modern work culture is fast, demanding, and often… *unforgiving to our health*. Long meetings, skipped bathroom breaks, endless cups of coffee — sound familiar? If you’re a working professional in Pune constantly hustling between Aundh, Baner, or Wakad, there’s a high chance you’re putting your bladder health at risk without even realizing it.

According to leading experts, bladder control issues are no longer restricted to older adults — they’re increasingly common among the corporate crowd, thanks to a mix of lifestyle choices, work stress, and negligence toward early symptoms. And yes, this is where the advice of an experienced [Urologist near me](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE) can make all the difference.

# Understanding Bladder Control Problems

Bladder control problems, or **urinary incontinence**, refer to the loss of bladder control that causes involuntary leakage of urine. It can be mild — like small leaks while coughing or sneezing — or more severe, causing frequent, urgent trips to the washroom.

# 1. Why Working People Are at Risk

Corporate life in Pune often means:

* **Sitting for long hours:** Sedentary work weakens pelvic muscles, affecting bladder control.
* **Delaying urination:** Regularly “holding it in” trains your bladder to ignore natural signals.
* **High caffeine intake:** Coffee and tea are diuretics that irritate the bladder and increase urgency.
* **Stress overload:** Emotional and physical stress both impact bladder muscles and nerves.

# 2. The Daily Routine That’s Doing Damage

A typical working day for many includes:

* Multiple coffee refills for energy.
* Long meetings where using the restroom feels awkward.
* Evening dehydration because of skipped water intake to “avoid frequent urination.” This pattern silently leads to bladder muscle dysfunction, infections, and even chronic urinary problems over time.

# What Dr. Sachin Patil Observes Among Pune’s Working Class

In his decade of practice, [Dr. Sachin Patil](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE), a renowned urologist in Pune, has seen a sharp rise in bladder-related complaints among young and middle-aged professionals.

He explains that the modern corporate lifestyle — high stress, poor hydration, lack of movement, and unhealthy bathroom habits — is pushing bladder health to the edge. Many patients from areas like Aundh, Baner, Pashan, Wakad, Pimpri-Saudagar, and Balewadi visit him with similar stories: long office hours, neglected symptoms, and delayed treatment.

With **10+ years of excellence** and **advanced surgical & non-surgical treatments**, Dr. Patil uses state-of-the-art diagnostic tools to help patients regain normal bladder function and restore confidence. His approach focuses on understanding the root cause — not just treating symptoms.

# Common Causes Behind Bladder Control Problems

Let’s break down the hidden factors most working professionals ignore:

# 1. Overactive Bladder (OAB)

A condition where the bladder contracts too often, creating a sudden urge to urinate — even when it’s not full.  
**Causes:** Stress, excessive caffeine, certain medications, and weak pelvic muscles.

# 2. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

Repeated infections irritate the bladder lining, leading to urgency, burning sensation, and leakage.  
**Why it happens in office-goers:** Holding urine for long hours and dehydration are common culprits.

# 3. Weak Pelvic Floor Muscles

Sitting all day reduces pelvic strength, leading to leaks during sneezing, coughing, or lifting heavy objects.  
**Tip:** Regular pelvic exercises can significantly improve muscle control.

# 4. Neurological Disorders

Nerve damage due to diabetes or spinal issues can disrupt communication between the brain and bladder, leading to control problems.

# 5. Hormonal Changes in Women

For working women, menopause and childbirth can affect estrogen levels, weakening bladder control mechanisms.

# Early Warning Signs You Should Never Ignore

* Frequent urination (more than 8 times a day).
* Involuntary leaks during physical movement.
* Burning or discomfort during urination.
* Constant feeling of a full bladder.
* Night-time urgency disrupting sleep.

**Ignoring these signs can worsen the condition**, making it harder to manage without medical help.

# How to Protect Your Bladder Health

Preventive care plays a huge role in avoiding long-term damage. Here’s a guide for Pune’s working citizens:

**1. Hydrate Smartly -** Drink 2–3 liters of water daily, but reduce caffeine-based drinks. Water flushes out toxins and supports kidney and bladder function.

**2. Don’t Delay Bathroom Breaks -** Train your body to follow natural signals. Holding urine for long stretches can cause muscle strain and infections.

**3. Move Every Hour -** Take short breaks from your desk — stretch, walk, or do simple pelvic floor exercises to improve blood circulation.

**4. Maintain Healthy Weight -** Extra weight puts pressure on the bladder, increasing the risk of incontinence.

**5. Limit Alcohol and Spicy Foods -** Both irritate the bladder and worsen urgency symptoms.

**6. Manage Stress -** Chronic stress releases hormones that can alter bladder function. Try meditation, yoga, or short breathing exercises at work.

If you notice symptoms persisting for more than a week or if urinary control affects your confidence or social life, it’s time to see a Urologist. Early consultation can prevent minor issues from developing into chronic conditions.

At his Pune clinic, [Dr. Sachin Patil](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE) offers personalized treatment options that range from simple lifestyle corrections to advanced urodynamic studies and minimally invasive procedures. His patient-first approach and deep understanding of occupational health patterns make him a trusted name across Pune’s corporate belt — from Baner and Balewadi to Wakad and Pashan.

# Final Thoughts

Bladder control issues aren’t just a “senior problem” anymore — they’re becoming an alarming reality for today’s working generation. Long office hours, stress, and lifestyle negligence are turning minor symptoms into major disruptions.

* * *

Jem arrives in Southampton with little fanfare, and to his great annoyance, on a public bus. It is far too early to be working to complete a job and he has to fight the urge to move immediately to a nearby cafe from which the distinct scent of caffeine wafts. The faint coolness of a breeze passes over the son of Hebe, ruffling his hair, cold enough to make the humidity of recent rain bareable. He moves away from the bus stop, settling outside the cafe to, at the very least, enjoy the smell of coffee as he stretches, a soft popping coming from his back as he twists.

The bus ride from Long Island was stifling at best, and a gods-given test of his patience at worst. The stench of cigarette smoke had seemingly filled the bus' interior despite Jem not being able to see a single whiff of smoke around. The inane chatter of the man on his phone and a child's tantrum some rows behind only made it worse.

The son of Hebe's introspection is interrupted rather abruptly when he catches a conversation between two teenagers holding skateboards.

""Man, Luke is an idiot! The sounds are probably just some raccoon that got stuck in the sewers. Where in the world did he come up with a demon?"" The dark-haired boy asks incredulously.

""You know Luke. His mom is like, hyper-religious. Anything even sort of freaky happens and his first thought is 'demon!'. It's a little crazy cause I think I heard him say his math test was possessed by a demon after the exam last week."" The boy with dirty blonde hair shakes his head with a sigh. ""Anyways, we should avoild the sewers for today either way. I don't feel like getting bit-""

Jem approaches then, interjecting into the discussion. ""Excuse me, you said there's strange sounds in the sewer?""

The blonde boy looks over at Jem, a faintly annoyed look crossing his face before he shrugs. ""Yeah, what about it?""

The clipped response is less than helpful so Jem skips to what he needs. ""How do I get into the sewer?""

""There's an open access under Cobden Bridge. What, you some sort of ghosthunter?""

Jem looks the duo over and nods seriously, not bothering to lie. They said it so they would be more likely to believe it. Either way, his mind is already moving away from the boys and to the Yale's probable location. The sewers under Cobden Bridge.

* * *

The sewer is awful, it turns out. Why the two boys and their friend skated here is beyond Jem. The place is terribly dark, smelled disgusting, and noise seems to echo for a good mile inside. All in all, it is not the best place for a Yale to hide and Jem doubts it is trully here. His doubts are proven right when after searching the sewer for over an hour, he finds an old, ragged man snoring. _There is the aforementioned noise._ Jem notes with annoyance. Back to square one.

As he turns to leave, a particularly loud snort leaves the ragged man and a rough voice calls to the son of Hebe. ""Hey, boy! You with those idiots who ride their ridiculous skateboards here?""

He stops, turning to face the man. ""No, I do not engage in ridiculous activities like that. I am looking for a… goat. A rare species that has been seen nearby. I heard about noises.""

The ragged man looks Jem over again, seeming to take him in for a moment as he fully wakes. He pushes himself to a sitting position and groans. ""A goat, huh? I think I saw a weird lookin' goat thing over near the Boulder Shack yesterday 'round evenin'. I thought the owner might have bought it as some kind of advertising thing and it ran away.""

Jem tilts his head, half-curls shifting with the movement. His eyes narrow for a moment in thought. Then, he nods. Reaching into his bag, he grabs the sandwiches he had made himself for lunch and approaches the man. With a dull thump, the brown lunch bag drops into the man's lap, and Jem makes sure to tuck some bills under the sandwiches.

""A gift for the information. Have a nice day.""

Jem turns and leaves for the Boulder Shack.

* * *

Entering the Boulder Shack, Jem is not surprised to find that the place is nearly empty, what with it being just before noon on a weekday. The best way he can discribe the place is… humble. Cozy, perhaps. It makes sense the Yale would not be here now, but if evenings are more busy, the noise might grow enough to attract the creature. No sign of damage or broken glass so it likely does not break in. Perhaps it just watches and the Mist obscures it enough that most choose not to ask questions?

A walk around the place only strengthens that belief until he sees the back door. Specifically, the scuffs along the side of the door that opens. Scratches seemingly, but Jem looks closer and sees the way the carved divots form a wavy pattern, as if a goat's horn had been used to pry the door open. He does not open the door since he notices an employee watching him but he does not doubt the metal latch of the door would be scratched from being forced out of place. The Yale breaks in durning the night.

He spends the rest of the day in and around the climbing gym and finally, he catches sight of his quarry. The beast is slightly larger than an average goat with a deep brown coat but what really stands out about it are its horns, the way they shift and swivel. Slowly, Jem approaches the animal with its backside turned to him, watching the gym. He is a few feet away when the horns swivel in his direction and the Yale stiffens.

Jem can barely blink before, in two swift movements, the Yale leaps onto the metal railing outside the building and boosts itself to the roof. Then, it dissapears out of view. Jem swears under his breath.

* * *

He hides inside the 'Employee Only' area within the climbing walls, of coure. He barely manages to tuck himself between some scaffolding in a way that is bother somewhat comfortable and hidden enough that the gym employees do not find him. Once he sees the gym's lights go out and the sound of conversation dips and dissapears.

Digging out a flashlight, a bundle of rope, and leaving his hiding spot, Jem moves quickly. He has no idea how long the Yale waits before breaking in and he needs his trap prepared before it gets inside. His plan, though he would never admit it to anyone if asked, is inspired by a show his father enjoyed watching when he was a kid. A mystery-solving show with a dog and some group of teens. Their leader had been an expert in traps and their mechanics.

He works fast, tying knots and using a few particularly good holds to secure and route the rope. He is almost finished and he tests the knots. One works, another slips loose, and a third refuses to slide. He grubles under his breath as he sets to redoing the knots. He does not have time for this. He's on his second-to-last knot when he hears it. A faint scrabbling at the back door and the muffled sound of soft bleating. Hissing between clenched teeth, Jem sets to his work with a fervor, adrenaline making his fingers fumble one knot and then it is done.

One left. He moves and starts on it. Slip knot. Simple. Another fumble and then- Click… Squeeeek. The back door opens. Jem does not have time to test the knot, he ties it and barely gets around the corner before the Yale clops into the building, bleating as its hoofs hit the ground once, twice. It snorts, horns swivelling and its unnerving goat eyes survey the inside of the gym.

Jem presses himself to the wall and looks up. He needs to climb to get the the perch he had set up. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to trigger the trap.

He sets to it slowly, quietly, as the Yale continues its slow meander around the gym. He's halfway up the route when disaster strikes. His hand slips and Jem's foot flags out to stabilize him enough that he does not fully fall but the thud of his foot hitting the wall is loud in the quiet gym. The bleating and clopping stops, then, there is a snort of air.

Jem moves again, this time a little faster as he hears the Yale begin to trot faster towards his section of the wall. He barely makes it up to the perch, hand reaching out to grip the end of the rope he had secured up here. And he looks down where the trap is set, a circle of rope in the middle of the floor, hidden in a shadow.

The Yale slows, trotting to a stop, looking about for the source of the sound and Jem's forethought in setting the trap up so he can remain above come back to help him. Another snort and the Yale moves deeper into the shadowed area. Just as its front and back left hooves step inside the circle of rope, the Yale freezes, horns swiveling again, and the shadows shift, as with Jem's terrible luck, a cloud that had blocked enough of the light to shadow the trap moves and the circle is lit with faint moonlight.

The goat-like creatures eyes lock onto it, then they follow the rope up and around. Jem's heart stops, a cold fear filling him when the eyes find him despite his perch. He triggers the trap, dropping from the perch. His weight pulls the rope which winds up and around hold, pulling the circle of rope close to catch the two left legs of the Yale. Not perfect but enough.

Hitting the padded floor, Jem feels his breath leave him and he barely keeps hold of the rope. Thankfully, a part of him forces his hands to clamp down and he stands slowly, tying the end he holds to another hold.

The Yale bleats loud and feirce, the noise grating and terrible as it twists its body and swivels its horns to try and free itself. Thankfully, it does not seem to be able to get the right angle to hook a horn around the rope.

* * *

Moving to the large, nearby sink, Jem turns it on and points his flashlight through the spray before flicking a coin through. ""Show me Argus of Camp Half-Blood.""

The light undulates, shimmers, and then the many-eyes chaufer of the demigod camp is there, seemingly adorned in a baby blue nightgown and night cap with a fluffy ball at the end. Jem narrows his eyes. _Are those eye masks along his neck and over his additional eyes?_ A grunt sounds from Argus, drawing Jem out of his thoughts. ""I appologize for disturbing your sleep Argus, but I have captured the Yale. If you would be willing to drive here to reansport me and the creature to camp, I would appreciate it greatly.""

Behind Jem, the Yale continues its bleating and writhing. There is a moment of silence, then a reluctant grunt. Jem breaths out and nods. ""Thank you, Argus.""

I've been working on an idea for a new kind of social platform called **TopicChat**, and I’d love to get your honest feedback before I build it out.

**The Problem I'm Trying to Solve:** I'm personally tired of the social media landscape. On platforms like Reddit or Threads/X, any interesting post or nuanced thought immediately gets buried under a mountain of low-effort comments, hot takes, off-topic arguments, and performative ""dunking."" It feels impossible to just have a genuine, deep conversation. On the other end, LinkedIn is too stiff, and everyone is just self-promoting.

**The Idea: TopicChat** The concept is a hybrid of a forum and a messenger, designed to create high-quality, focused conversations.

Here's the user flow (I've attached some mockups):

1. **Discover:** You browse topics you're interested in (e.g., ""Side Hustle Culture,"" ""Mental Health Destigmatization,"" ""AI Ethics"").
2. **Post a ""Thought"":** Instead of a full post, you share an ""initial thought"" to act as a conversation starter. (e.g., *“Everyone talks about starting a side hustle, but nobody talks about the burnout.”*)
3. **Request a Chat:** Other users see your thought. Instead of a public comment, they send you a **private ""Chat Request""** with their own thoughts.
4. **Accept & Chat:** You review your requests and ""Accept"" the one you find most interesting. This opens a **private, 1-on-1 chat**.
5. **The Twist:** The chat is **limited** (e.g., 6 messages each). This forces the conversation to be meaningful, concise, and have a clear end.
6. **Publish:** Once the chat is complete, it gets **published to the main feed** for that topic. Everyone else can now read your finished conversation from start to finish, like a mini-interview.

The goal is to create a ""library of human conversations.""

* **For Participants:** You get to explore an idea with one other person without all the noise.
* **For Viewers:** You get to read a high-quality, authentic conversation without having to sift through hundreds of junk comments.

**My Questions for You:**

1. **Would you use this?** Either as someone starting a chat or just as a ""viewer"" reading them?
2. Does the idea of a limited-message chat (e.g., 6 replies each) sound appealing or annoying?
3. What are the obvious flaws or potential problems you see with this?
4. What kinds of topics would you *love* to see discussed in this 1-on-1 format?

Thanks for any and all feedback!

**tl;dr:** I'm building a site where you have a 1-on-1, limited-message chat about a specific topic, and the finished chat is then made public for everyone else to read. Think ""publicly viewable coffee chats."" Good or bad idea?",2,1761154238.0,ideavalidation,0,1.0,False

Nights where your laptop light was the only thing keeping your eyes open after your 9-to-5.

You told yourself “just one more tweak” while the clock hit 2 a.m.

You designed every pixel in Canva like it was a masterpiece. Chatted with ChatGPT for hours until you forgot what your original idea even was.

You built the “perfect” landing page, picked the cutest platform, posted on social media… all you hear is crickets🦗

**Here’s what I mean:**

You say:

""Digital marketers who want to post beautiful content.”

They want posts that bring in sales while they’re at their kid’s soccer game.  
They want to stop babysitting their phone all day just to get one comment.

You say:

But your audience doesn’t want a morning routine.  
They want ten quiet minutes before the kids wake up, a cup of coffee, no noise, just them and their thoughts.

Quick Flavor Notes: Cinnamon, Pumpkin Pie Spice, Astringent

Texture: Thin and smooth

Recommended: No

Ingredients: Pumpkin, Pumpkin Pie Spices, Red Habanero Peppers, Garlic, Vinegar, Lime, Sugar, Salt, Sodium Benzoate, and Potassium Sorbate

Zesti Hot Sauce out of Cleveland, OH may or may not still be in business. Their website is still active but they’ve been showing out of stock on all items for pretty much the entire year. I’ve previously reviewed their XXXtra Hot Freshly Grated Parmesan Garlic Hot Sauce and absolutely loved it (and the beauty of their cheese based hot sauce is what made me seek out Buc-cee’s Hot Cheddar Hot Sauce, which is a bottle of distilled garbage juice). Since it’s Pumpkin Spice season I decided to open up this flavor from Zesti to see if it would be another hit.

Fiery Pumpkin Spice Hot Sauce starts things off with pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices, a good start for what’s on the label. Following up with red habaneros, one of my favorite peppers in any hot sauce, keeps up the ingredients win-streak. Things get a little stranger with the garlic and lime juice – both classic pairings with habaneros, but not so much with pumpkin or pumpkin spice. Unfortunately Zesti also decided to include artificial preservatives in this one, both sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, things I never want to see in any hot sauce. This sauce does have a very pumpkin-spice-y aroma, though the vinegar and peppers do come through in the nose. This is a thin sauce with a smooth texture and in fact comes with a flip-top with an integrated orifice reducer.

While I’m not a big coffee drinker I’ve been known to enjoy some pumpkin spice coffee this time of year and Zesti Fiery Pumpkin Spice Hot Sauce goes hard on those pumpkin pie spice flavors. Typically those are cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, and sometimes allspice. In this case they absolutely dominate the flavor of the sauce with the cinnamon coming on especially strong. There’s not much pumpkin flavor which surprises me since it’s the first ingredient listed on the label, yet this sauce also being so thin makes me question how much pumpkin could actually be inside. Angry Goat Pepper’s Pumpkin Habanero Hot Sauce is quite a bit thicker with much more pumpkin flavor. Compounding the overbearing pumpkin pie spice flavor in this sauce is the fact that it tastes somehow artificial – like the cheap pumpkin pie spice syrup they have by the coffee bar at 7-11. The lime juice combined with the vinegar does give this sauce a surprising sour edge that you don’t expect with the fall flavors as well as an astringency and the garlic gives it a savory anchor point that seems at odds with the rest of what’s going on. The habaneros themselves add some quick sting of heat but are overpowered in flavor by the pumpkin pie spices, though you can get a tiny bit of pepper flavor towards the back of the palate.

Pairing on this sauce was difficult. The bottle suggests chili, soup, and sweet potato casserole. I only make sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving so a bit early for that, though I did try this in some chicken and corn chowder there the result was poor – the artificial edge of the pumpkin pie spice flavor coming on especially strong in that context. I tried this with some fried ham since it often pairs well with warm spices and while not awful I wouldn’t say it was good either, again too much pumpkin pie spice not enough pumpkin. As a last-ditch effort I thought this would be good on ice cream and that was the most successful pairing, though the garlic was distracting and again that artificial astringent flavor crept in.

I’m not going to recommend this one. Not only is the flavor imbalanced there’s also an artificial edge to it and it’s somehow way too thin for the amount of pumpkin it’s supposed to contain. Add in the use of artificial preservatives and this is one that’s safe to skip whenever (or if) Zesti ever manages to restock.",5,1761153962.0,hotsauce,2,1.0,False
1odemyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellnessmindandbody/comments/1odemyp/what_is_mindfulness/,What is Mindfulness,"As we go through our the day, we deposit little energy balls. One is left at home from your daily morning routine.[ If you](http://routine.You) drop the kids off at school, that's another energy ball. You sit in traffic, that's another energy ball. Being at work is another energy ball, or more likely several. By lunch time, you are likely feeling like you need another coffee or some sort of energy drink to get back all the energy that you have expended thus far through out the day.

Alright, so what do little energy balls have anything to do with being mindful? Well, to me, being mindful is taking a break to notice your low energy and take action. When you are mindful, you can say, ""Hey. I'm feeling stressed already and I still have a lot of day left. I'm going to take this time and let go of all the stress from earlier today. I'm not going to let it weigh on my brain anymore. I release the stress form this morning."" And in doing so, all those energy balls that you deposited throughout your morning come flying back into your bucket and fill it back up, therefore refilling your energy.

Another way of saying it is that Mindfulness is checking in with yourself to see how you are feeling and if you need to do something about it. Are you feeling stressed, hungry or sleepy? If you are feeling stressed, you can take a few deep breathes and release your morning stress by practicing mindfulness. If you're hungry you can take this time to eat. If you are sleepy, hopefully you can take a nap or at least get a coffee.

The best part about practicing mindfulness is that you can do it whenever you need to. You can do it every time you step away from your computer, or when you drink a glass of water. When you put your car into park and turn your car off, you can take a quick moment then as well. You can decide the best time to do it for yourself.

You will start to notice the benefits immediately. For me personally, when I practice mindfulness, I have a longer fuse before feeling stressed or even angry. Other people have said that doing it before bed helps them sleep at night. I notice an immediate calmness after practicing mindfulness. I would recommend it to everyone as it can be modified to your needs. It can be short or long or done at anytime or even several times through out the day. I highly recommend it. So go on, give it a try and start feeling more energized, less stressed and more happy.",1,1761153949.0,Wellnessmindandbody,0,1.0,False

1odejs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellnessmindandbody/comments/1odejs3/self_awareness/,Self Awareness,"Self awareness is being aware of yourself. Specifically: your feelings, emotions, values, and core. It's how you see yourself as well as how others see you too. Who are you? What do you stand for? What are your likes and dislikes? What makes you you? How do other people see you? Do they know what matters to you or what doesn't? Are other people seeing you for what you are trying to tell them? Or are they seeing something else? I like to think of it as running a diagnostic scan on yourself: how am I emotionally? How am I physically? How am I mentally? Do I understand the connection between feelings and actions?

Emotions and feelings: You just got mad. Do you know why that made you mad? Do you know what to do about it, or how to fix it? For example, ""I just dropped my ice cream and now I'm mad and sad. I'm mad at the seagull for divebombing me and I'm sad that I didn't get to eat my ice cream."" Now what? I can choose to stay mad and sad, or I can go buy another ice cream and eat it away from the seagulls, like in the car. I can choose to not be mad at the seagull for being hungry. I can choose to not be sad over ice cream. Even though it would have been a yummy treat. How did other people see me during this scene? Did they think I was just some crazy woman yelling at birds? Did I react proportionately or disproportionately. How do I think I reacted during this scene?

Self awareness is assessing yourself and also trying to see how others would assess you as well. This way you can have a whole idea of how you are and not just a one sided opinion. For example, maybe you don't think you have a drinking problem. But when you ask friends or family, maybe they think you drink more than you should. Comparing these two or more takes can help you see how you actually are in the real world.

Another example: You are excited because you were invited on an 8 mile hike. But, as disappointed as you are, you decline the invitation because you know that you could only safely hike 2 miles right now based on the fact that you have done zero training or hardly any exercising. This is an example of being aware of the limitations of your own body.

Being self aware can help you make decisions that are better for you and your future. Being self aware can also increase your happiness as you make these better decisions for yourself. For example, your friends want to go out But you notice that you are feeling exhausted and kind of burnt out. So, instead of saying yes, you say no, and stay home to rest for the weekend. By Monday you are feeling well rested and more energized.

""Ok. This is great and all. But how do I become better at being self aware?"" you ask. Well, you need to take the time to check in with yourself. Name that emotion! Try to notice the changes in your feelings and emotions. They will change during the day depending on what you are doing. You might be tired in the morning and then when you have your coffee, suddenly you are feeling awake and ready for the day. Another thing you can do is ask for feedback on things about yourself. This helps you realize if you and the real world are on the same page or not. For example, maybe you're witty comments are not coming off as funny after all and instead are coming off as rude. You won't know until you ask. Another thing is to practice mindfulness. This is basically stopping to run that diagnostic test and to give yourself a chance to give energy back to yourself. Your giving yourself the ability to let go of stress or negative emotions which will give you more energy. Self reflection is another thing. This will give you the chance to say, ""Hey, me, maybe I did over react to that poor seagull. I shouldn't have yelled at it. Maybe I need to eat sooner instead of waiting so long. Maybe my blood sugar was too low. Or maybe I was stressed about trying to get ice cream and having to wait in line for so long."" Another thing you can do is to take time to make sure you really know what your values and what you stand for are. This will act as your moral compass and will help you make better and faster decisions for yourself. If someone is asking you to do something against your morals, the answer is ""NO!"" If you don't know what your morals and core values are, this can lead to decisions that make you feel yucky.

In conclusion, take the time to figure yourself out. Be able to name your emotions, feelings, core values and morals. Seek feedback from others to help aid in self reflection. Being more self aware will actually put you in more control of your own life. You will make better decisions and be happier both in the short term and the long run. So go on, start improving your self awareness today.",1,1761153749.0,Wellnessmindandbody,0,1.0,False

- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes 
- From CEBU

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A SINGLE guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, 27-35 years old, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:,
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives).

We recently moved into a house that has a fenced in front and back yard (they're connected). We want to let our dog roam free but she barks and acts aggressive at the fence to some dogs walking by the house. Is there a way to correct this behavior?

She's a good dog, and really only acts like this way when in our new yard. When we walk her, she doesn't have this behavior. She'll sniff the dog and move on or try to play. Also, we'll tie her up in front of restaurants/coffee shops when we go in and she doesn't act aggressively when dogs walk by, we've done this since she was a puppy with no issues. Finally, it's not every dog that walks by the house.. 

I do want to say, the place we moved from had a really mean, big dog move in next door a few months ago (It's one of the reasons we moved). It barked nonstop when it was outside, which was usually all day and into the night, and would try to escape to get at my dog. I really think it  affected my dogs mental state because she is a protector so I think she was constantly on alert ever since the dog moved in. I think this is part of her current behavior.

The house is in a city and we get a lot of foot traffic past the house so I hope we can correct this behavior because she LOVES being outside laying in the sun and ppl watching.  It's her favorite!

In case you want the breed 
25% Aussie 
25% Cattle dog 
50% Mutt (she has some German Shepherd in her)

Let me know if anyone has ideas!

I find comfort in the sound of timeless music — Daughtry, Goo Goo Dolls, Queen, Linkin Park, The Calling’s , and old bands like The Carpenters, Air Supply, The Beatles, and Bee Gees.

There’s a certain peace that comes with listening to those songs while sipping coffee, watching the trees sway, and hearing birds chirp. It’s like stepping into a moment that time forgot.

1odef6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1odef6g/somewhere_beyond_the_sea/,Somewhere Beyond The Sea,"My grandfather practically lived in the ocean. The sea called to him, uttering sweet songs of promise and peril, and he answered, fishing rod and bait in hand. There wasn't a day where he wasn't drenched in the sea or carried its scent with him. There would be times when I would visit him during the summer and he would just get inside his own house after fishing for a while. He wasn't at all a frail old man and he was probably more physically fit than other elderly people I have met, yet he did have his moments of weakness.

Our neighborhood was built along a cliff facing the water, so whenever my grandfather needed to get his fix of sea salt, all he would need to do is walk out his back door. I always lived down the block from my grandfather, so going to his house was only a matter of deciding whether or not to take two minutes out of the day to go and visit him. My parents never cared how long I went to his house. I could have been at his house for a year and they wouldn't care. But the amount of time he spent out at sea disturbed them. It wasn't unheard of to go to the beach by the cliff side. It was normal to play around in the sand, make sand castles, and watch them get wiped out by waves, mocking you with the slightest bit of sea foam that followed it. But something about the frequency and how he would talk about the sea felt unnatural. He was family though, and that was enough for my parents to trust him.

I remember the first time he took me out to the ocean like it was yesterday. It was in the summer and my parents were out of town for the night. My mom had to stay the evening shift at the museum and my dad's boss decided to give him overtime at the office. Sure his wife worked evenings often, but this was a fantastic opportunity to squeeze more work out of him like a soggy rag. I remember walking to my grandfather's house with a big smile on my face. I always loved going to his house. Though in hindsight, I feel he was a bit weird and off-kilter. But as a kid, he was possibly my favorite person to be around. He had a huge back yard that I would sometimes bring some toys with me to play in. There was this wooden fence with a gate that prevented me from accidentally falling off the cliff side and I would always try to take a peek over the fence. My grandfather, being the responsible babysitter my mother always relied on, always made sure to keep me from tipping over, and would sometimes instead have me sit on his shoulders to see the view of the vast sea that he visited almost every day.

He had this fire pit in his backyard that we used to make s'mores in at night. It had a shoddy setup of old metal foldable chairs, rusted by the wrath of the atmosphere. But despite that setup, we made it work. He would always tell stories of giant fish he wrestled with in the ocean and of maidens singing beautiful ballads to him. Every fish that he caught, there was a story behind it. Every wave he rode was an adventure. Every sound was a song. I would always look forward to listening to these stories and he would always be looking forward to telling one. This particular story was about how he saw this giant fish that he found swimming in the middle of the night. He didn't catch it yet, but he plans to go out tonight. I would always ask him if I could go with him, ever since I was four. Usually, he would say that I was too young. But this time, after he finished his story, he said, ""So kiddo, I told you this story because I might need some help catching this one. I think you are at the age where you can help me. Would you like to help me catch it?"" I was ecstatic. I practically fell out of my seat. ""Yes! Yes I do!""

""Alright, let's go!"" He picked up his fishing gear and started to leave towards the cliff side.

I jumped up from my seat and followed him with a huge grin on my face. We made it to the fence and went down the rocky steps formed by the cliff side. As soon as we made it to the boat, my grandpa took both oars and rowed with all his might. I asked if he needed help, but he assured me he got it. It took several minutes before we went out to the ocean away from land. I could see the entire cliff side from the water. 

My grandfather closed his eyes and took in the evening breeze. “The beauty of the ocean is the silence. There’s no arguments or interruptions, just the sounds of the waves. It feels safe. Almost like a blanket. And now, kiddo. I think you should be able to experience this with me, too.”  
  
I couldn’t agree more. The ocean was peaceful. No wonder grandpa came out here so often. My grandpa stood up, threw his hook into the water, and sat back down. He then offered me the pole. “The fish won’t catch itself.”, He said with a smile. I snatched the fishing pole with excitement and almost started reeling in as fast as I could. My grandpa’s words stopped me, “Not yet, wait for a bite.”

“How will I know when the fish bites?”  
  
“When it tugs on your pole. You should also see the tip of your rod bend more. Focus on the rod itself.”  
  
I then squinted my eyes and “focused” on the rod harder. My grandfather laughed. “This isn’t a competition, Sam. Just feel the breeze. Save your energy for the fish.” 

I closed my eyes a bit and breathed in the sweet scent of the ocean. I felt the waves rock the boat ever so slightly and felt the soft breeze gently push against my face. It all felt still, safe. Suddenly, a yank from the pole. I jumped up. My grandfather kept me steady. “You got him! Now reel! Reel! Pull away from the fish!”  
  
I did as he asked, I gripped the pole with iron resolve and pulled away from the fish as I furiously reeled the line in. It was hard, but luckily my grandfather was there to root me in the boat. I kept cranking the reel, my noodle arms wiggling from the stress I placed on them. “Hey grandpa! This must be a big one!”  
  
“It must be to give someone as strong as you a problem!” He laughed at his own joke.

I pulled, I reeled, I yanked and cranked. It wasn’t budging. Suddenly, I felt my grandfather pick me up. I kept on reeling, and pulling with all my might. The fish flew out of the water and flopped around on the boat. My grandfather quickly picked up the creature and wrestled with it until it stopped. And there it was. In my grandfather’s arms was a striped bass. It was huge. The thing passed beyond his shoulders. He could take someone out with it. This was the fish of his legend.  
  
“Nice catch, kiddo,” He said with a smile, still trying to get the fish to stay still. 

Once we gave the fish the time to stay still, he dropped the fish on the boat, looked at his watch and said, “Woah, look at the time. It is time for bed, kiddo. Do you want to do this with me again? I can get you your own rod if you would like.” My eyes widened, “You mean it?”

“Yeah, why not?”

That was probably the happiest I have felt in a while. I got to live the adventures that my grandpa spoke to me about. “Yes! Please get me my own rod!” My grandpa smiled and pat my head, “Sure thing, kiddo.” 

After a few hours of being out at sea, my grandpa took both oars at hand and rowed back to shore. Once we got back to the house, my grandfather told me to wait in the living room for dinner and so I turned on his old “flat screen” TV to *Avatar the Last Airbender*. He never wanted me to see him gut the fish, thought it would be too much for a ten year old to witness him cut open a fish carcass and watch as the innards spilled out. I could still remember the thick, metallic scent of fish meat intermingled with blood coming from the kitchen as he whistled the song, *Beyond the Sea*. His whistles kept in time with the harsh scraping sounds he made with the knife as he cut into the flesh of the fish. Once he finished dicing up the remains of the titan, he stored them in tiny little containers and kept them in the freezer. The next few days we had bass for dinner. I surely didn’t complain, mostly because I knew in my mind that I helped catch it.

For the rest of the summer, it became routine. Every afternoon, I would visit my grandfather and we would go out to sea. Then, when it would get dark, he would place a lantern on the floor of the boat and tell his stories out in the middle of the ocean. His stories seemed much more real when he told them out at sea. I felt that I could imagine them better. That I could put myself and his shoes and actually feel the light evening breeze at the sea that he would rave about. I could feel the rocking of the boat and even imagine what it was like to man a boat in the middle of a storm. It all just clicked. And whether or not we caught a fish didn’t matter much to us. It just felt right. Just to go out to the ocean felt worth it. 

By August, the fantasy was over. I had to cram my Summer Reading assignment before the school year started, so I stopped going out in the ocean with my grandfather. Instead, I would just read my book in his living room, alone. During the first few weeks of school, my time was so limited with homework and projects that I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had been neglecting my grandfather. Whenever he would ask me if I wanted to go out into the ocean, I would be so busy that I just had to say no. And I can still recall that every time I declined his offer, he looked as if he felt hurt. Like I had rejected him, rejected the sea. I felt a bit sorry for him, leaving this old man to go out to the sea alone again. So, I decided to go out with him for one day during the weekend. Homework and projects be damned, but I wanted to spend time with my grandfather for a little bit. So, the next time he asked, I gladly put my books down and went out with him.

Though this time I went out to the ocean it was different. It felt different. It felt alien. Like I wasn't supposed to be there. The wind felt sharper, more cold. The sea felt more rough than relaxed. My grandfather was stone faced the entire time he was rowing us out to sea. I would constantly ask if he was alright or if he was tired, and he would always answer that he was fine, that he felt great, even. He would ask me about school and I would tell him, though I still couldn't shake the feeling of something different that might happen. He pulled out his lantern and placed it in the middle of the boat. Then he stood up as if he were to tell me a story again. But this time it was different. This time, he got up and said, ""You know, the ocean here missed you Sam.” 

“What?”

“The ocean misses you. You were gone for too long. I could hear it calling to me. It was asking where you went.” 

I was puzzled. Why would the ocean miss me? I tried to force a laugh to see if my grandfather was joking. He wasn’t. He was dead serious. His face contorted with fury, “You think this is a joke? You abandoned our friend like that, and you think this is some sort of joke?” His voice escalated with every word that left his mouth. You could physically touch the scorching hot rage boiling inside of his chest. My throat dropped to my stomach. “G-grandp-?” 

“It’s not very nice of you to abandon our friend like that, Sam! And to laugh at her grief too? What’s wrong with you?”

The waves matched his fury and rocked us both violently as I held onto the side of the boat. My grandfather started to get closer to me. His giant hands snatched my shirt like two giant bear traps and tried to lift me up. I held onto the boat for dear life not knowing what he would do when he lifted me into the air. My ten-year-old strength failed me and he started to hold me by my shirt. He brought me close to his face. I could see his blood-shot eyes and the veins popping out of his neck. His breath smelled like an awful combination of coffee and rotten fish. Then he spoke through his gritting teeth.   
  
“Do you hear her?”  
  
“W-what?”  
  
“Do you hear Carol?”

I shook my head. Then suddenly, something switched inside my grandfather. His veins were no longer bulging out his neck, his bloodshot eyes stared beyond me, but his vice-like grip remained tucking at my shirt. The waves also calmed down. Everything was still. The slightest breeze sent a chill down my spine. He slowly let me down and sat down in his seat, still staring into space. Then, realization kicked in. He looked at his hands in horror and looked at me. He reached out to me. “Kiddo…” His voice shook. “I’m-” 

I recoiled to the back of the boat. We stared at each other in silence; the only sound that was heard was the light rolling of the waves. Any slight movement my grandfather made, my grip on the boat tightened. He grabbed the oars and slowly started to row us back to shore, trying to make no sudden movements to startle me further. As we were slowly cruising towards the shore, the air felt sour. I felt sick, like I could hurl off into the infinite sea. Once we made it to shore, without saying a word, I jumped up and ran towards my house. I ran inside, ran upstairs to my room and shut the door violently behind me. 

I couldn’t sleep. As the night went on, all I could do was stare at the coat hanging behind my door, praying, hoping my grandfather wasn’t going to slam it open. The coat just hung there, and I could swear the sleeves were stretching and creaking their way towards me. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t get up. The sleeves started to slither on the ground towards me like snakes. The ends of the sleeves  reached towards me as it started to climb onto my bed. The claws of the coat were getting closer and closer, I think I could feel them pulling at my shirt, trying to make their way towards my neck, then suddenly, day broke. The coat was normal. My room was illuminated by the harsh, bright light shining through the window behind me. The birds chirping and the sound of the sea, beckoning me to come back to the waters. 

My eyes were wide open, but I still felt tired. I sluggishly got out of bed. I have never felt the weight of not sleeping until I got up that morning. My head was pounding, every move I made felt sluggish and I fought every urge I had to go back to bed. It was seven in the morning. I had school today. I got dressed, dragged my feet down the stairs and slowly made my way to the kitchen. I took out a box of Frosted Flakes from my cupboard and poured the cereal into my bowl as the golden, sugary grains made ringing sounds against the ceramic. I then dragged my feet to the fridge, pulled out a gallon of milk, and carefully poured the milk into the bowl, watching the grains drown in the liquid, completing my sugary soup. As I shoveled the cereal into my mouth, I brought all of my attention to the clock, seven-ten. I still have some time. My bus came by the house at eight-thirty, so I felt I had plenty of time. I shoveled more of the sugary substance drowned in milk as I made mental notes in my head about what I was missing. I’m clothed, and my backpack should be by my-. My backpack. I left it at my grandpa’s house. The sooner I realized it, the sooner I quickly dropped my spoon into my bowl and rushed out the door towards his house. 

I stood there at his front door. I was frozen. The wooden titan loomed before me. I could see myself in the brass knob, pale and disheveled from a lack of sleep. Struggling to bring my hand towards the door to knock. Why am I so afraid? This was my grandfather. He would never hurt me. But, last night felt like an exception. Last night was the first time I ever feared the old man. Fear. That word and my grandfather even as a concept together felt like it would never be. Like water and oil – they never mix. But all it takes is a little shake. All it takes is a disturbance and the two can meld together. I swallowed what fear remained of the old man and promptly knocked on the door. I waited a few minutes. Nothing, not a sound. I knocked on the door, louder this time. Nothing again. I tried to twist the doorknob. It was locked. I didn’t know what time it was now, or how long I was standing there. All I knew was I needed that backpack.

I rushed to the right side of the house and tried to open the giant wooden gate before me. It was locked. I hoisted myself over the fence and dropped over the other side into his backyard. It felt foreign. The grass blades of his back yard flowed in the wind and almost looked as if they were breathing or feeling for my presence. I slowly walked towards the back sliding doors of the house. As I drew closer, I was hoping my grandfather wasn’t staring before me or worse, waiting for me at the open doorway. I hid myself along the side of the house and looked towards the backyard. I found him. He was blankly staring off the cliff. He seemed to be out of it. I slowly tiptoed towards the sliding doors, keeping an eye on him so that he wouldn’t surprise me. I kept going, thinking about each step that I took, making sure that I didn’t make a sound. My eyes constantly shifted between pointing between two places, my grandfather and the wide open sliding doors.

I eventually made it inside and my nostrils were attacked with the metallic scent of blood and fish. I usually expected this smell from this house but this time it seemed stronger, like he recently gutted open a fish. I continued towards the living room where I left my backpack and there it was. I slowly made my way towards the backpack and headed straight for the front door before I heard the sliding doors shut followed by the feeling  like a quick rush of wind from behind me, bursting through his bedroom door. I quickly looked behind me. Nothing was there. The door was closed, and suddenly the house seemed darker. My attention was pulled toward my grandpa’s room. Illuminated by a small, dim, light. A voice in my head screamed, “Get out of there! What are you doing?” But my body seemed to move on its own. 

I slowly tiptoed my way towards his room. The smell grew stronger. The closer I got to the doorway, I swear I could hear something get louder. The sound of sobbing. I got closer and closer to the door as the sound got louder and the stench grew stronger, practically holding my nose in a chokehold. I held my breath and pushed onward and found my grandfather’s bedroom. In disarray. Books on the floor, pages torn out. Heads, fins, innards of fish strewn all over the floor. And above his headboard were the words:

I CAN STILL HEAR HER. HER SONG CALLS TO ME.   
EVERY TIME I DON’T ANSWER IT GETS LOUDER.  
THE SIREN GROWS RESTLESS.   
THE SEA CALLS TO ME.   
IT SPEAKS.  
THE SEA SPEAKS

repeated over and over again written in rotting fish entrails and blood, some of the intestine sliding off of the wall, obscuring the other messages. I could still hear the sobbing, even louder this time, easing its way out of his bathroom door to the right. I tiptoe closely to the door, careful to not stand on any loose floor boards as the sobbing gets louder and louder. I peek into the room and finally see him. His hands were drenched in the blood and mucus of whatever he just butchered, cupping his hands around his ears. 

“It won’t stop.”  
  
“The song won’t stop.”  
  
“I can’t stop it.”

“No matter what I do I hear her.”  
  
My grandfather slowly curls onto the floor, uttering the words, “Make it stop… Make it stop….”  
  
He kept sobbing. Though I was horrified by him, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. I tried to extend my arm to him from the creek in the door. Before suddenly, the door creaked open. My heart ran to my stomach. My grandfather’s head bolted up and looked right at me. 

“You…”

I jumped back and ran for the door. I heard him scramble onto his feet and follow behind me, howling   
  
“YOU DID THIS TO ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT!!!”  
“YOU ANGERED HER—THE SIREN!”  
“THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR PUNISHMENT, NOT MINE!!!!”  
  
I burst through his bedroom door and scrambled down the hallway. I could hear his footsteps getting closer. I ran into the kitchen before he picked me up with my backpack and turned me around. I tried to slip out of the straps before his bear-like claws snatched at my neck, squeezing tight. I could feel the air getting trapped in my lungs, all the blood rushing to my head. My hands tried to pull his hands away from my neck, but nothing, they wouldn’t budge. My right hand rested on the bloody mess that was his countertop. I tried to feel around and—got it. His knife. Without a second thought I shoved the knife into his shoulder right. He howled in pain before letting go of me. I dropped to the floor finally taking in air again. My grandfather sobbed more wildly, holding the knife in pain. I raced for the front door. I heard my grandfather’s sobbing quickly turn to shouts of rage as his footsteps got louder behind me. I unlocked the door and ran outside, shutting the door behind me. As I ran away from his house and towards mine, I thought I may have heard a squeak on the floor and a thud against the door. 

I rushed towards my front door before being confronted with my mother. “Where were—”, She gasped. “What happened?” She quickly grabbed me by the shoulders to look at my neck, covered in whatever my grandfather was butchering. “What is this? What happened to you?” My heart sank to my stomach. Tears were welling up in my eyes. I sniffled and said, “There’s something wrong with grandpa.” My mother, no questions asked, rushed to the phone and called called nine-one-one. She stated on the phone that he fell. She then called work and told her that she was going to be home today, that something happened. She put the phone down after saying, “Thank you.” and quickly got me into the bathtub. 

For the rest of that day, all I could do was stare into space, imagining how safe the ocean was with my grandfather. Imagining better times while my mother washed the blood and mucus that used to caked my grandfather’s hands. There were times where she held down the vomit from the smell that came off of it. My father came out of his room and passed by the bathroom door before exclaiming, “Ugh, what is that awful sme—”. His eyes grew wide as he saw his wife, practically in tears trying to clean off their dead-faced son. “What happened?” My mother told him how she found me, and what I said. Horrified, he went to the phone straight away to call off from work. This call, unlike my mother's, ended in a screaming match. He promptly told his job that he quit and hung up the phone. For the rest of the day, he did whatever he could to help my mother. For the entire time I was home, I was silent, staring into space while my parents were trying something, anything to get any words from me. They would constantly ask what happened, where grandpa was, what he was doing. All they got from me was silence.   
  
Later that day, my grandfather was reported missing. They suggest foul play since the first responders saw what I saw in the house and found a pool of blood with a streak resembling someone who slipped in it sitting right by his front door. They also noticed some bloodied footprints that led out to the door, and out to sea. The case was never solved though. My grandfather was never found and his house was condemned.  
  
Ever since then, I have been doing fairly well in school. I was a top student for most of my academic career, and since high school, I had a certain draw to marine biology. I was always fascinated with the ocean, so the field didn’t seem too far away from what I knew as my safe place. 

I went to university and graduated with a masters in marine biology. Saying that I made my parents proud was an understatement. Later that week, everyone in my family was invited to my house for my graduation. I was happy to see who had shown up, cousins, uncles I haven't heard from in years came all this way to congratulate me. It felt nice, but I couldn't help but notice that there was always someone missing whenever my family hosted some of these events. After a while, I felt I needed some fresh air, so I went outside to the beach into our back yard to just stare out into the vast ocean that was behind my house. 

My mother came out the back of the house to meet with me, and asked if I wanted to join the family. I said, “I just wanted to get away from the noise. It’s quiet out here.” She nodded her head, ""Well, don't stay out for too long, everyone is here for you."", ""I know. I will catch guys in a bit."" My mom kissed my forehead, told me how proud she was of me, and turned back to the house to join the rest of the family. 

After I stood out there and gazed at the stars, I noticed that a rowboat appeared to my right. That was weird, I haven’t seen that before. There was something in me that compelled me to go in, so I went in. I rowed out to sea, out to the spot my grandfather and I went fishing. The waves were calming, reflecting the night sky while rocking the boat like a cradle. It felt safe. I closed my eyes and started to hear something. Whistling. I knew the whistling sounded familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The longer I heard the whistling, it became clear to what tune it was whistling to.

""Beyond the Sea"".

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Celtics vs. 76ers: A Tale of Two Teams, One ACL, and a Lot of Spreads**

The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers kick off the 2025-26 NBA season like a pair of overcaffeinated referees—full of energy, slightly chaotic, and missing key personnel. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat geek who’s *definitely* not a mathematician.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Numbers Lie (But Mostly Don’t)

The betting market is in a tizzy. Boston is favored at **-4.5** on the spread with decimal odds of **1.53** (implied probability: \~65%), while Philly sits at **+4.5** with **2.5** odds (\~40%). The total is locked at **229.5 points**, with slightly better value on the **Under**.

Here’s the rub: Boston is missing **Jason Tatum** (ACL) and has **Jaylen Brown** listed as questionable—imagine a band missing its lead singer *and* guitarist. Philly, meanwhile, is without **Paul George**, who’s nursing a knee issue that’s less “injury” and more “a polite exit strategy.”

Statistically, both teams averaged **225.9 points per game last season**, but that was when they had full rosters. Now? Boston’s depth is being tested by **Payton Pritchard** (filling in for Tatum like a square peg in a round hole) and **Sam Hauser** (a role player elevated to starter, which is either a Hail Mary or a Hail *Mary* depending on his 3-point percentage). Philly’s reliance on **Joel Embiid**—the 7-foot-4 anchor who’s basically a lighthouse in a storm—feels even more pronounced without George.

### News Roundup: Injuries, Cameos, and a Dash of Absurdity

* **Boston’s Absences**: Tatum’s ACL injury is the sports equivalent of losing your favorite coffee shop’s espresso machine. Without him, the Celtics are leaning on **Derrick White** (a defensive wizard with the offensive touch of a toddler at a buffet) and **Pritchard**, whose highlight-reel potential is best described as “a guy who once hit a game-winner while tripping over his own shoelaces.” Jaylen Brown’s status? A question mark so large it could host its own Netflix docuseries.
* **Philly’s Plot Holes**: Paul George is out, which is like a superhero movie where the sidekick gets written off in th

Everyone blames “the system” or ATS bots, but recruiters aren’t using magic filters. We’re skimming hundreds of resume a day looking for 3 things:
1. The title matches.
2. The company stage matches.
3. The problem space matches.
That’s it. If you hit all three, you make it to the human-reviewed pile. (Yes, I’m a checked box recruiter)

If you have no experience, we’ll look at your projects. If you have no projects, RIP.
Now let’s be real about a few things:

- Referrals are overhyped.Used to be the secret weapon. Not anymore. Some companies get 20%+ of applicants through referrals, so many that they removed bonuses completely. Everyone’s referring everyone. It’s crowded. Don’t spend too much time to get one.
- ATS isn’t about your GPA or school filterIt’s all about keywords. Half of resume get filtered out because they don’t match the JD language. Find someone working your dream role and straight up copy their keywords, job title, tech stack, phrasing.

If you’re applying right now:
* Apply within 3–5 days of posting.
* Use company portals / apply directly, don’t use 3rd party, they are tryin to collect your data while company preferred direct application on the portal 
* Fix your resume keywords!!
So many CS students asked me on Linkedin and I’m tired of random coffee chat so Imma share it here. I’ll answer anything honestly, job search myths, internal hiring politics, or what recruiters actually say in Slack. Ask me anything.

Edit: People dmed me for the source of resumes but I dont think I can share it. There are some free third party out there I feel like helpful [Cooked Career](https://www.cookedcareer.com) or resumerep.app ",145,1761153331.0,csMajors,44,0.97,False

I have tried to adjust where I can, but recently I have been feeling really neglected and alone. I understand that being a lawyer can be stressful, but I can't help but feel my boyfriend has no work boundaries or work-life balance and its negatively effecting our relationship.` 

`I have tried to raise in the past with him that I feel very lonely at points in our relationship, and stated that it makes me sad that I more often than not go to bed alone, and that I can't plan vacations for us. He can't committ to going to weddings or parties with me. I expressed that I feel like I can't get excited about things anymore due to his work schedule, and furthermore, I do not feel like I can open up to him about anything I am struggling with in life because his focus is on work and hes stressed. In times past when he's been stressed and I tried to open up about any issues I was personally facing or I felt in the relationship, he would snap at me, say horrible things about/to me, and tell me that its unfair for me to bring anything up. sometimes he apologizes after, sometimes he says I am unsupportive and dont get it.` 

`I try to be as supportive as I can in the ways I know how (cooking/buying him a lot of meals and coffee, suggesting activities he could do to take a mental breather, try to not text or call him when hes busy, etc.). but I cant help but feel my needs are being neglected and I feel so alone in this relationship.`

`It's gotten to the point where I don't open up about any mental struggles I am having, and he has barely touched me physically in a while (even when I feel like I basically threw myself at him). There were times where our relatioship was great, but now I cant help but struggle in feeling like I dont want this to be the rest of my life.` 

`my huge dilemma is that my boyfriend has expressed that he feels utterly trapped in the attorney job. When i tried to explain to him about feeling lonely, he took it as an insult and a dig against him and said I was being unfair because I knew he was feeling trapped.`

`I have expressed time and time again that I think his work and approach to work/balance is unhealthy, and that I really do want the best for him. However, I feel myself shrinking into the shadows to support him. I dont feel like I have a partner, but I also dont want to be an asshole and break up with him because of his job when hes stated hes sensitive about it and feels trapped.`

This is the last (and maybe most important) post I'm going to write about SIBO.

In our TLDR society, this post unfortunately doesn't have one. You'll have to read the whole damn thing. I'm not going to dive deep on what it was like before (previous posts will showcase the misery that was living with SIBO every day).

Started in 2019, and was $10K+ and 3+ years of living hell (couldn't digest food), but if I had to start over I'd know exactly what to do.

I found some herbs that worked really well for the short-term, I came across Seed which is a freaking amazing product, but a while back (maybe a few months now) I decided to stop taking that too. My digestion went from great to great.

As a ""healed"" person, I'm going to share my final thoughts on SIBO.

Please note this is simply what worked for me, and you can do with that what you will.

DISCLAIMER - I know someone's going to chime in with ""this is stupid"" or something along those lines. Look, I'm just someone who lives without symptoms and eats what they want to eat, when they want to eat it (have been known to enjoy the odd cinnamon bun or hazelnut gelato, but for the most part I stick to a clean vegan diet, fast 18:6 with the odd prolonged fast). I can only share my experience. If you're unwell, and you hate this post, then just keep being unwell and we can go our separate ways. I gain nothing from writing this.

Healing at the root.

SIBO is not the problem, it's the symptom of the real problem. Western medicine will focus on the symptom, because that means you're going to be a paying customer (subscriber) for longer. If you want to heal for good this time, you have to get to the root of the problem.

Trauma and Incoherent Information

I recently spent a week at Dr Joe Dispenza's week-long advanced retreat in Mexico. There were some amazing studies and incredible data on what takes place in the microbiome after 7 days. He said ""of course the microbiome is going to be different, because the person is different"".

Article: https://drjoedispenza.com/dr-joes-blog/exciting-early-findings-from-our-quantum-research-study

When the body has a traumatic experience, it stores it in the ""please never let this happen again"". Enough of these, and the body becomes conditioned to stay on high alert mode, in an attempt to protect itself from experiencing the trauma again.

My ""symptoms"" were at their worst when I was broke, running a brand new business with no idea what I was doing, with a 6 month old daughter, in a marriage that was crumbling, trying to figure it all out. Not a lot of time for rest, digestion and repair.

If the nervous system is saying ""run, fight or hide from this dangerous situation"", do you think it's going to block off time for digestion and healing? Of course not. Too much danger in the short-term.

Then the MMC stops working properly, along with your entire digestive tract, and of course bacteria isn't going to be swept properly through the intestinal tract. Bacteria begin to multiply and of course you will end up with a bunch of them in the wrong place.

Trauma is incoherent information stored in the body. In the east they talk about chakras (Sanskrit for ""wheel"" / energy centers and the 7 primary ones that run from the base of the spine to the crown / pituitary gland.

As Bessel van der Kolk explains in The Body Keeps the Score, information literally gets ""stuck"" in the body following a traumatic experience that sent the body into a sympathetic response.

Practice reliving the experience often enough, and you can activate the sympathetic reaction by thought alone with zero effort (living on autopilot).

If you can liberate the stored emotions and energy stuck in the body, you can stop doing all of the surface-level stuff like antimicrobial protocols, Rifaximin (worst experience of my life), going to the naturopath, avoiding FODMAP's, avoiding restaurants etc.

Lastly, if you're scared of eating ""trigger foods"" (I've lived when everything is a trigger food, and when nothing is a trigger food; the second one is better), every time you eat you are panicking below the surface that you're going to have to ""pay for it"". You check where the closest bathroom is, you start hyperventilating, your nervous system is not in a place to digest food and then you wonder why you're having a ""flare up""

Getting the Body Back Online

I do not take anything for my digestion. I drink coffee on an empty stomach every morning (sometimes more than I was planning). I have one solid movement in the morning (unless it's cherry season, then we could allow for 2). I wake up with energy, I sleep 7+ hours through the night, and I eat whatever FODMAP's I damn well feel like.

This is what life is like when your body is in balance. Living in a state of incoherence, the body never has a chance to come into balance or alignment. There are so many ways to activate the parasympathetic response and start bringing the body back online, but here is the key:

Chronic conditions always require a lifestyle and identity change.

You can't keep living as the unhealed person who obsessively looks for answers outside of you. Our bodies are amazing, they're not meant to be set off like a volcano every time we eat an apple or an avocado.

I'm going to leave a list of resources, books, daily practices that I use or have used as major stepping stones in my healing journey. Living as the healed individual is so much more enjoyable, even if it means you have to face some hard shit or stop doing what you've been doing every day.

The last thing I will mention here is ""the breath"".

There is a breath that I've practiced for a couple years after reading the book Becoming Supernatural, but I felt like I ""mastered"" it across the 7 day event.

For the record, it's not something I'd dive into with zero experience as it could trigger some not-so-nice experiences if you've been living with these stored traumas for years or decades. Take it slow.

There is a dormant energy at the base of the spine (Kundalini) which, once activated, will make its way past all of these ""wheels"" and eventually into the brain. It is a life force that is not to be dabbled with, and it's also a gateway to living as the creator and not as the victim.

Why I'm telling you this - you don't have to ""know"" what all your traumas were. In fact, I'd rather you just did way with them and got on with your life. This breath, when done properly, will drive that energy upwards and transmute that stored information back into what it started as (pure energy).

As I mentioned, do not just dive straight into this but rather start by reading the book and bringing the energy centers into balance before attempting.

Resources / Practices (ZERO AFFILIATE LINKS SO DONT EVEN GO THERE):

    EFT Tapping - I would start with ""The Science Behind Tapping"" and then find a really good practitioner in your area or online
    Cold Therapy - I would read ""The Wim Hof Method"" and actually practice what it teaches. Cold water is nature's wonderful anti-inflammatory, I still swear by cold showers and ice baths every day.
    The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk - Amazing book about how trauma stores itself in the body and how time absolutely does not ""heal everything""
    Exercise - Do it every day
    Joe Dispenza Resources - I would start with Breaking the Habit or Becoming Supernatural, and would highly suggest either an in-person event or the Progressive Workshop. Microbiome study: https://drjoedispenza.com/dr-joes-blog/exciting-early-findings-from-our-quantum-research-study
    Seed Probiotic - This was huge for me in bringing the microbiome back into balance
    Fasting - 18:6 or 20:4 every single day. Give the digestive tract time to heal and come back online.
    Breathwork - 9D Breathwork is a beautiful journey, but Breathe with Sandy on YouTube is a great place to start. Gateway to stored emotions.
    You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay - Beautiful outlook on how we create dis-ease in the body
    Meditation - Whether it's Dr Joe or other, I dedicate 1-2+ hours of my day to these practices for a reason
    EMDR - Find a local practitioner or start with www.virtualemdr.com
    Somatic Experiencing - Somatic = for the body. At a subatomic level, trauma is energy. New energy can move stored energy, and when stored energy moves you are liberated.
    Diet - With every food choice, you are 3D printing your future body. Choose wisely. I don't eat meat, will once in a while have dairy or gluten (have been vibing with almond croissants lately). For the most part it's fruit + nuts + protein shake around 1-2pm and then some sort of rice + vegetables + plant protein at dinner. Tonight I had to send it with an Oreo gelato after dinner because it's my favourite flavour, zero guilt involvted.

Final takeaway - EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS WITHIN YOU.

That innate intelligence that spins the globe and grows your hair, has the power to heal you for good.

I'm so annoyed that the image describing models (like the autocaptioners, but actually any multimodal LLM) are pathetic bad at getting left and right correct.

You can easily get them confused by showing them an image of a person facing the camera (i.e. nearly all images with a person). When that person is holding something in the hand (cup of coffee, a sword, anything) or is doing something with that hand (opening a door, adjusting the glasses, anything) the models will most likely mix left and right.

Of course it is ""difficult"" that the right hand of a person facing the camera is on the left side of the image. But we have full blown LLMs that are multi modal. They should easily be able to know that.

And no, it's not one stupid model. It's Gemini's best (2.5), it's Qwen. And it was all earlier models that I used as captioners as well.

  
So, to be constructive:

Can someone please generate a benchmark where it is judged how the models handle spatial information? Left and right is obvious but can become really complex, especially when camera left/right is mixed with subject left/right and multiple subjects are in the scene.  
Up/down and infront/behind are also interesting use cases.  
And most interesting is when everything comes together.  
Actually, I think it shouldn't even be hard to create that benchmark. Using blender and some scripting should be able to create artificial images that would be good enough here.

I'm sure the current models with fail clearly. But such a benchmark would perhaps force the model creators to fix this annoying weakness.",0,1761152980.0,LocalLLaMA,0,0.5,False

1ode19m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ode19m/caffeine_adderall_xr/,Caffeine & Adderall XR,"I got prescribed Adderall XR 10 mg two weeks ago. The first week I quit coffee because of the spike and crash — and my doctor told me to quit it too. At first, the meds worked great: strong focus, motivation, less impulsivity, and steady energy. But now it feels milder.

My sleep got worse early on — I wake up and fall back asleep multiple times through the night (4 a.m., 4:30, 5, etc.). Even with magnesium glycinate, it’s still not perfect. I take it around 5:45-6 a.m. and now sleep about 7-7.5 hours (used to be 8-9 before meds).

I started adding ¼ cup of McDonald’s ground coffee when brewing (I used to use a full cup when making it). It’s really good right now I feel it. I’ve been more disciplined with diet and the gym, tracking calories  so I don’t overeat or undereat. With this combo, my focus and energy stay strong until around 12 p.m. — concentration solid, impulses low. After noon, when I break my fast, my focus and energy drop off. I’ve tried a second small coffee before, but it gives me a spike, higher impulsivity, and a crash. First seems to work better.

I messaged my doctor saying I want to try immediate release since XR feels too mild now and affects sleep. Told him it’s been harder since quitting caffeine, and he reminded me to stay off it.

So should I switch to immediate release so I can quit caffeine completely?
Or stay on XR but raise the dose to 15 mg and keep a small coffee?

My husband and I were both hearing the voice of our cravings loudly before we gave in, and even though at one point I said ""I want to do this but I don't want any of the consequences,"" I did it anyway.

Nothing terrible happened. We got a 12-pack of White Claw Surge, made steak nachos, watched Survivor: Pearl Islands, and went to bed.

But also? So many terrible things happened. I slept terribly after months of blissful rest: waking up every 45 minutes, tossing and turning, terribly thirsty, sweating and freezing, in and out of the bathroom, headache, unable to get comfortable at all. I'd been pooping like a champ for months but I've had extremely unpleasant intestinal distress for the past, like, twelve hours now. I'm *anxious* physically and mentally. I had nightmares I couldn't struggle out of (despite feeling like I didn't sleep). I could feel my heartbeat accelerate after a couple of drinks to a scary place I haven't felt in, again, months. I took a sick day from work today and postponed coffee with friends -- after so long being able to rely on myself. I still feel like hammered shit and I stopped drinking like 14 hours ago.

I guess I needed to learn this. Even when nothing terrible happens, so many terrible things happen. I can't believe I used to feel like this all the time on purpose.

Long story short, we’re long distance now and our communication has been failing. So, I decided to do a sweetening jar to sweeten things up. This is exactly what I did:

I wrote his name and DOB in red. On the back I wrote a petition: X always chooses me. He desires me. He always makes time for me. We are in a healthy and harmonious relationship with mutual respect, love and adoration.


I put it in the jar with his photo, buried it in sugar and honey and added cinnamon, lavender, pink/red rose petals, basil, orange peels and coffee grounds (to speed it up). I set my intention, which was pure and healthy love (he already cares about me, this is just sweetening it) put on subliminals for pure love on repeat and felt all the emotions. My mind was very in tuned to good vibes and thinking of us together. Then, I poured red and white wax on it to seal it while visualizing us together. I felt so amazing. I felt more attractive too. Said affirmations as the wax was melting like ‘we are deeply in love. He always reaches out to me. No one can ever come in between us. Our sex is always passionate’ blah blah. 

I have felt so much energy since doing this and even have felt amazing. It’s like my worries with him had gone away. I also did a self love jar.

It’s been three days since doing the sweetening jar, and it’s almost like I’ve lost all feelings for him. Like I’m so detached? And, the rose where I picked the petals from is dead. They were fresh roses! And the other flowers are perfectly fine and healthy. Idk where I went wrong? Maybe it just wasn’t meant to be which is fine. But can someone tell me what happened?

1oddt0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1oddt0a/3_months_of_prep_pass/,3 months of prep -> pass !,"firstly thank you reddit for your endless motivation and advice that i wouldn't have found else where

here's a quick summary of my prep incase it helps anyone! 

studied three months properly with no other obligations of uni or a job and that felt plenty to me. I'm currently in the fourth year of my med school (US IMG) and had already dealt with almost every topic in step so i felt comfortable with a short duration of prep. 

NBME Scores : 26 - 60; 27 - 69; 28 - 69; 29 - 74, 30 - 80; 31 - 79; 32 - 82, 33-82. 
old free 120 - 86 
new free 120 - 80 


Start of prep 3 months before exam : boards and beyond + FA annotation; I didn't remember much in the long run from BnB but it was great to pack my first aid with information that was missing from it. I especially highly highly recommend the neuro portion of BnB he tells you really how to solve localisation questions. 

Uworld was my main source I completed my first pass of around 90% of it by my exam and didn't feel the need to chase after finishing the rest 10%. It was absolutely vital to my prep and I recommend keeping yourself in the practice of solving questions. I had a 55% correct by the end of it but didn't feel too bothered by that either since I vastly used it as a learning tool. I made sure to supplement all my incorrects with FA and keep referring to FA for my mistakes so I would remember the exact word to word explanation when thinking about that concept. 

I started my NBMES two months from my exam with 26 as a baseline and reviewed them heavily, i wanted a score above 80 to be absolutely sure that i would pass even tho it took a few nbmes to get into that range. My advice for that would be to really deeply acknowledge the concept + question solving mistakes I made and going over the mistakes more than once. 

The 2 weeks before the exam I started refocusing only on my weak spots and focusing lesser time on topics I was already good at and for that I recommend taking a few NBMES at least online so they can highlight areas to focus on. I studied anatomy + ECG in more detail and went through the neuroanatomy document by Mehlman and also repeatedly going through previous NBME incorrects. My last two weeks were mainly NBME concepts being honed on. 

The day before the exam I did not study even tho I felt very squeamish about that and out of place suddenly not studying but I believe it paid off, I would try to ask myself a concept and then have just no clue and get so scared about not remembering and it would have been much much worse had I studied. I woke up early and went to bed early even tho sleep only came late. I also puked once unfortunately but other than that was fine. I just ended up not having coffee the day of the exam then. 

Woke up early -> heavy breakfast of egg on toast and fruit juice. Took one redbull with me to help me in the last few blocks just in case. Make sure you don't wear pants with pockets or hoodies because that will eat up time during your breaks.  

Exam Itself : 
Very vague but the adrenaline keeps you focusing on the question in front of you you really do not have time to worry about the questions you just answered. The concepts however were VERY similar to nbmes and free120 and any opinion other than that is wrong. there's almost nothing completely foreign in the exam. There's definitely some questions that seem ridiculous I imagine these are the experimental questions but they will still be related to some kind of topic you can guess. My time management felt fine i finished almost each block 5-10 mins early and was able to review the questions I flagged. the length of questions on the exam for me at least was much longer for 50% of the questions i felt but they are easy to understand what diagnosis they want. make sure MAKE SURE to skip to the last sentence and skim its the only reason my time management was good. I felt super weird after the exam, I knew i didn't panic at any time during the exam feeling lost but i also couldnt remember a single question and felt so confused about how i had really performed. 

And I just got the P today! could not believe it for a long time. 

My ending advice would be : trust your NBMES,  do not go back and overthink and change answers unless you are absolutely absolutely sure, eat well sleep well and take things to the centre to prepare you for anything - meds like panadol, extra water some antacids whatever you may need. 

Hope this helps anyone :)

My grandfather died 5 months ago. Maybe 6? It was early May. Heart attack, pretty sudden, he was 74. We were really close. He basically helped raise me because my parents both worked a lot when I was a kid.

So this is gonna sound weird but my grandfather collected state quarters. You know the ones from the 90s and 2000s where each state has a different design on the back? He had this whole collection, kept them in those blue folders with the slots for each state. He'd been collecting them since the program started and was super proud when he finally completed the set.

He used to give me quarters when I was little. Like if I did well on a test or helped him with yard work or whatever, he'd give me a quarter from his collection and tell me which state it was and some random fact about it. It was our thing.

When he died, my grandmother gave me his collection. All 50 states, complete. It's in my apartment now on a bookshelf.

About a month after the funeral, I'm doing laundry and I find a quarter in the dryer. Delaware, which was his favorite because it was the first state to ratify the constitution and he was super into history. I figure it fell out of my pocket or something even though I hadn't used any quarters recently. Put it in my change jar, whatever.

A week later I'm getting into my car and there's a quarter on my driver's seat. Georgia. I live alone, my car was locked, no one else has keys. I don't know how it got there. I'm confused but I tell myself maybe it was already there and I didn't notice? Even though I definitely would have noticed sitting on it.

Then it keeps happening.

I find a quarter in my shoe. In my winter coat pocket when I pull it out of the closet in September. In my work bag in a zipped compartment I never use. Under my pillow. In the shower caddy. In the freezer behind the ice tray.

Always state quarters. Always from my grandfather's collection era.

At first I'm trying to rationalize it. Maybe I'm just noticing quarters more because I'm thinking about my grandfather? But some of these places don't make sense. I found one INSIDE a book I was reading. Like between pages I hadn't gotten to yet. The book was on my nightstand, I'm the only one who lives here, and the quarter was just. there. Between pages 247 and 248.

Last week I found one in my car's cupholder. Vermont. I had cleaned out my car the day before, the cupholder was completely empty. I drove to work, was in the office for 8 hours, came back to my car and there was a quarter sitting in the cupholder.

I called my mom about it and she got quiet and then told me that my grandfather used to do the same thing to her when she was little. Hide quarters in random places for her to find. She said he called it ""treasure hunts"" and he'd hide them in weird spots and she'd find them throughout the week.

I didn't know that. He never did treasure hunts with me, he just gave them to me directly.

I've found 12 quarters so far. I started keeping them separate from my other change. They're all from different states. I checked his collection and none of them are missing - all 50 are still in the folder.

My girlfriend thinks I'm putting them there and forgetting because I'm grieving. But I'm not. I know I'm not. Some of these places I physically could not have put a quarter without noticing. The book thing especially. And the car cupholder when I was at work all day.

I'm not scared exactly? It doesn't feel threatening. But it's weird and I don't understand it.

My grandmother won't talk about it. When I mentioned it to her she got upset and said I was ""stirring things up"" and hung up on me. I don't know what that means.

Part of me wonders if I'm losing it. Like maybe the grief is making me hallucinate quarters or something? But they're real. Physical quarters I can hold and spend (I haven't spent them, I'm keeping them).

I found another one this morning. In my coffee mug. I had taken it out of the cabinet, it was empty, I turned around to get the coffee pot and when I turned back there was a quarter in the bottom of the mug.

Rhode Island.

I just stood there staring at it for like five minutes.

I don't know what to make of this. I've tried researching if objects appearing is a thing but everything I find is about objects moving or disappearing, not appearing.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I'm not religious, I wasn't really a believer in ghosts or whatever before this, but I can't explain it.

The rational part of my brain says there has to be an explanation. But I can't think of one that makes sense.

I miss him a lot. Part of me wants this to be him somehow letting me know he's still around? But that sounds crazy when I say it out loud.

1oddmru,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1oddmru/relationship_with_food_during_weight_loss/,relationship with food during weight loss,"Hey there, I recieved many dms appreciating my last post. So thought of simplifying everything for you all. 

First of all, green tea, coffee or any other sponsored drink that a dumb dick sells is not going to get your stomach ""snatched"".
The only thing that matters is CALORIES IN AND CALORIES OUT. 

Carbs are not your enemy. Fats are not your enemy. Sugary drinks yeah they might be. 
Dont fear pizza or burger cause that's all they are. Food. Not bad or good food. Just food. 

So why is there fear around foods? Well they are generally higher in calories and are less satiating than say sweet potatoes so people tend to eat those and add other things so feel full. Leading to high calorie consumption. Does it mean that you have to give up your favorite cookies or papa John's Pizza? Heck no. I would rather have my fingers crushed  in a door than quit these bits of happiness from my life. 

The key is moderation. 

We all have our caloric window, in which we can eat absolutely anything we want and still lose weight. The snacks just tend to take a bit more space in that window leading to fear that pizza is bad and chicken breast boiled is good.

You can gain weight even if you eat way too many chicken and rice and lose weight even if you only eat  two burgers and not live a sedentary life. Choice is yours, given you also need fiber and you dont really get that much from those two slices of cabbage. 

Also getting into carbs. Carbs are not your enemy as people make it out to be. 1g of carbs hold 4g of water in your body. 

It's a bit more complex to explain but I'll try to make it simple. Basically if you are used to eating carbs and you switch to keto which is personally awful for me, you'll lose water weight which your body stores. Those massive reduction in weight is not fat. It's just water. That's all. Nothing miraculous in that.

You can gain weight even in keto diet if you go beyond your maintenance level. 

Carbs get the bad rep because people dont understand what happens with the body. 

1. Diet consisting of 1200 calories at maintenance level which has like 250g of protein and some fat and fiber will lead to a steady result on the scale. 

2. If you keep the calories the same and add carbs and reduce protein a bit and fat, it will lead to a massive spike on the scale. 

Now it's understandable how a person can feel that they have been eating the same calories and just started eating carbs and that led to weight gain and now you fear carbs. But understand that carbs are just holding more water making you look fuller too. I am sorry if I was not very clear with this one, i hope you get the idea. 


Also medications which says that side effect is weight gain, isn't making you gain weight by its own unless it's messing with hormones. Generally it's just making you hungrier which leads to you eating more and then you know gaining more weight, so people who deal with those have to be slightly more cautious. Mindful actually.  If I have missed any point I'll edit it in. Good luck ^⁠_⁠^",3,1761151768.0,workout,2,1.0,False

Normally I'm able to let it roll off or defuse the situation but that's becoming more difficult as of late.

One of the issues with my LO is that she spends the majority of a 24 hour period in her recliner aside from getting up to fix a cup of coffee, food or use the bathroom if she hasn't already soiled her pull-up. I bought her a power recliner with a lift option to make things easier for everyone and she knows how to operate it and use the lift function. Until she doesn't. This morning she asked for help getting out of the chair because she was stuck from severe back pain. Helped her get situated and then tried to gently explain her back is hurting so much because her upper body was bunched up in the chair with the back almost straight up. Immediately became defensive and started yelling that it's because of her legs and she knows her body. Tried to explain it again but said ""okay, your legs are one of the reasons your back hurts. The way you slept in the chair is the other reason."" That set her off and I made the mistake of trying to show her how she was sleeping by pulling up the camera. I tried to keep my calm but fired back telling her not to raise her voice and yell at me because I'm trying to help her understand the why behind the pain. From there we went in circles for a few minutes before I stopped myself in part because she tried to put her finger in my face. Something she did to her late husband when trying to bait him into grabbing it or pushing it away so she could say she was being attacked.

Legal docs have been finalized and I now have POA so I'm playing catch up with getting her into the proper specialists but that's still going to be a slow process. Realistically she needs to be in an AL facility but is still lucid enough to make her own decisions so that's not going to happen any time soon. Has anybody figured out how to not fall into the trap of going in circles with your LO when they start yelling and belittling you or mocking you when you're simply trying to help?",3,1761151687.0,dementia,7,0.81,False

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

Chef Ramsay had dismissed the Red Team, and as both of them returned to the dorms without a word, Dani would mention in her confessional of how it sucks that her partner from the last challenge had to leave, but in all honesty, she kinda did this to herself. Nobody on the Red Team wasn't at all fond of Janie to begin with, not like most were going to miss her. In spite of all this, the tension was still evident, and it was only a matter of time until something spilled over. As for the Blue Team, while they were happy to win the service, Ruben scoffed in his confessional of how it’s a ‘granddaddy ol’ time’ to win, but then he also has to deal with all the lightweights, he presumed, namely Rio, or as he calls him, ‘Wet Mop’. 

Both teams would return to the dorms, but Tem would march straight up and confront Nicole, demanding to know what the hell she was even thinking of putting her up over something ‘miniscule’. Nicole rolled her eyes and told her this is what happens when you let the pressure get to you, and Tem responds that she should talk; she remembered when she called her an idiot during service, and before that, she argued. Nicole would retort to Tem that if she weren’t such a petty, ‘rushaholic’ bitch, she wouldn’t have nominated her. Isabela would shake her head in her confessional of how this feud between Tem and Nicole is getting out of hand, and it’s getting to a point where she’d want both of them gone. Their argument would get intense, with Nicole getting close to Tem’s face, asking if she wants to go, ready to get physical. However, Shayna, as well as Samuel and Freddie, would intervene, with Shayna ordering both ladies to cool down. Tem and Nicole would storm off in opposite directions, with Nicole calling Tem a bitch and giving her the finger, whereas Tem would rant in her confessional of how Nicole’s blaming everything all on her for no damn reason other than some needless bullshit she doesn’t know what, and whatever happens, Tem’s gonna fight harder to stand where she is than that ‘skank with smelly boots’. Meanwhile, Kara and Dani were talking with Allison and Sierra, and they seem to be in agreement that as long as the feud is still on their team, it’s gonna whittle their team down. Kara and Dani, in particular, would state that Tem does have her issues, but they’d rather keep her on the team, which makes Sierra ask if they’re sure, explaining her attitude could be a problem, citing her slamming her hands earlier in service. Dani would tell Sierra that it was on her, because she didn’t communicate, but Sierra responds that even then, Tem probably wouldn’t be a reliable leader to work under. Meanwhile, Allison would make a confessional of how she’s been cramming in the books for her psychology classes, and even she knows what Sierra’s up to; she’d just shrug and say if she can’t beat her, join her. Sierra would tell Dani and Kara it’s their call to make if they can actually work with Tem, but say that she could either be actually great, or just as toxic as Nicole. Without another word, she gets up off her chair and walks away, with Allison telling the ladies that she’s probably gonna make her mind up soon for who might go. 

Meanwhile, Tem was hanging with Samuel, David, JC, and Freddie, the latter she’s sitting next to, with Tem venting to them about how much of a noisy bitch Nicole is. David would state in his confessional that he’s seeing two different shades of Tem; one who’s all friendly and has a ‘go with the flow’ vibe, and the other that’s hardy and is willing to argue back with someone; he doesn’t know which one is tried and true. Tem would groan in her palms, with the men trying to be gentle around her, with JC trying to cheer Nicole up, telling her that she’s in good hands. Tem would sigh, and say she thought she’d escape shitty scenarios like being with her terrible ex, but she explains how she’s grown a lot more, and she’s not afraid to fight back someone if it means getting them off her back. She apologizes to the men for venting; she just wanted to throw out some dirty laundry, with Freddie nodding, and telling her to not worry about it. The air seemed to drift to a different kind of tension, and it’s nothing negative; of course, people can see it, with David chuckling in his confessional that it looks like Tem and Freddie might be getting a little *too* close. Over at the dorm kitchen, Ruben was making a sandwich, and Edward would chuckle about this little ‘happening’ between the two teams, and Ruben would snarkily respond by saying showmance is overrated, taking a bite from his completed sandwich. The Red Team would also notice Freddie and Tem talking to each other more, with the other three guys at their table (Samuel, JC, and David) giving them some space. Dani and Kara would coo each other of how cute it might be, and even Nicole hears this from her lonely spot, peering in to see what’s going on. She would haughtily state in her confessional of how *lovely* she’s getting along with one of the guys, but states how this is how ‘succubi’ lure men into their trap; just being all innocent and sweet, but they drain them of everything; warning Freddie to keep a second opinion. Meanwhile, Wanda, Shayna, and Isabela were talking amongst themselves, with Isabela learning that both of them used to be culinary instructors themselves. Isabela would ask each of them what changed, with Wanda explaining that she had gotten a new job at another restaurant in Detroit, which seemed to start paying the bills faster. As for Shayna, she explained she never really quit, but her mentorship began to evolve into a catering business, where she would help assist her fellow catering chefs with working on busy holidays, especially Mardi Gras, and Shayna would follow up in her confessional of how she’s heard of people her age or older who’ve been eliminated from Hell’s Kitchen, but what separates them from herself is that she’s been used to these scenarios back home; she exaggerates she can cook an entire small town in under five hours. Wanda would casually invite Isabela to check out the Pontiac Motorgrille if she’s up for it, and Isabela chuckles, saying she would definitely think about it. Later on, Freddie would mention the principles of working in high intensity kitchens, and he tells Tem that what happened to him was a wake-up call. Sierra, eavesdropping, would make a comment about how great it must be to bounce back after nearly burning himself out, with Freddie mentioning of how it did put a dent in service for his team, but he casually mentions that he’s just got to be more careful, with Sierra saying he definitely should, before walking off. Tem would leer in Sierra’s direction as she walked off, with her telling Sierra in her confessional to stay in her lane. Tem and Freddie would talk a little bit more, before they decide to call it a night, with Rio mentioning the moon’s calling them to go to bed. When he saw they didn’t laugh at his joke, he awkwardly tells them that he agrees with them; they want to get up fresh and early, but he sheepishly would walk off to the dorm room to change. Freddie would reassure Tem that Rio’s probably just excited for another day, and Tem would tease him, telling him her team might snatch a victory from behind tomorrow. As they went to turn in, Freddie would state in his confessional that he knows Tem’s a much lovelier person than people like Nicole and Ruben would like to make out to believe, but right now, he’s got to focus on one thing; showing Chef Ramsay he can be a leader too. Tem would share the same sentiments in her own words in her own confessional. 

\-----

**Challenge**

The following day, and everyone was still fast asleep, except for Rio, who, an early bird, would try and stretch himself awake. His back was turned, as he tried to do it quietly and soundly, trying not to wake the other chefs up. However, he did not seem to hear footprints from the other side, and suddenly, he would hear a shrill sound reverberate throughout the dorm. The El Paso-native turned around with his hands over his ears, as he saw Michelle blowing a whistle, and her and James ordering him, as well as the other chefs to wake up, and get downstairs; Chef Ramsay has an urgent message for both of them. Rio would state in his confessional that he had just seen ‘his next several lives ahead’ when he heard Sous Chef Michelle blow a whistle. All of the chefs that were asleep would groggily pick themselves up, put on their jackets, and hurry downstairs. However, as soon as they were greeted by Ramsay, they saw the United States Coast Guard behind him in the dining room, with them performing an impromptu formation. Dani would be enamored by this, and state her excitement in her confessional of how she didn’t think the Coast Guard, of all people, would be doing a formation routine, but she’s all surprised. Meanwhile, Samuel would mention in his confessional of how he had ambitions of wanting to join the military, but due to his imprisonment and criminal record, it forced him to stand back. As soon as the routine was finished, Ramsay thanked the leader of the Coast Guard, as well as the other members for a glorious act. Then he would turn around, telling the chefs of what they had just seen; the United States Coast Guard, of course, but has told everyone that they will be present for one of Hell’s Kitchen’s recurring challenges; the breakfast challenge. Edward would scratch his head in his confessional of how he’s heard of breakfast challenges in Hell’s Kitchen, but he wasn’t sure if they were going to do one or not. Ramsay would tell them that this challenge will test each chef of their performance in a usual restaurant rush, even in the morning! Ramsay tells them the Coast Guard is a great asset, full of leaders, teamwork, and endurance, and he tells them that if they (the Coast Guard) can do it, so can they. He tells them the Coast Guard will be having breakfast here, and he warns each of them they’re especially bringing up an appetite, and Wanda would state in her confessional that back at home, the Pontiac Motorgrille’s open from 6 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. for breakfast, meaning all day, every day, and confidently states that this task is very easy for her. Ramsay would tell them that the team that completes their orders first will win the challenge, and instructs both teams to prep in their kitchens. Once each chef went to their respective kitchen, he went over to Marino and told him to open Hell’s Kitchen for breakfast.

***Red Team: Nicole, Allison, and Shayna on Eggs, Dani and Isabela on Crepes, Tem and Sierra on Pancakes, and Wanda and Kara on Meat***

***Blue Team: Samuel and Henri on Eggs, David and JC on Crepes, Edward and Freddie on Pancakes, and Rio and Ruben on Meat***

\-----

**Breakfast Service**

The Coast Guard officers would enter the dining room, and Chef Ramsay would begin reading out tickets to the Red Team, calling for two scrambled eggs, one crepe, and one sausage, with Kara saying in her confessional that she loves to get up and early and cook breakfast with a smile; it’s too bad she can’t have any, but she’s more than happy to share it with other people. Shayna would be in charge of the kitchen, hoping for a smooth service. But then Nicole would ask for another minute on her eggs, and this seemed to confuse the kitchen, with Allison asking in her confessional how much time does Nicole really need; it’s just eggs, it’s not a big deal. Upon serving the eggs up to the pass, Ramsay would turn around and ask Nicole if she really does like crispy eggs, and before Nicole would respond, Ramsay tells her someone in the Coast Guard might not, and orders her to start over, with Nicole rolling her eyes in her confessional, stating that at least they’re not runny. However, this momentum would continue to slow, as Isabela would be forced to start over on her crepes, seeing that they’ve been browned up. Ramsay would complain about this, but thankfully, Isabela would send up a much better crepe, only for Nicole to, this time, serve up runny eggs, with Ramsay asking why is the egg all runny, and sarcastically joke how the egg tried to cross the road. Isabela and Kara would giggle at this, and Ramsay would school the two ‘schoolgirls’ to take it seriously, reminding them of the Coast Guard outside in the dining room, before turning to Nicole to start over. Thankfully, Nicole would get the eggs right on her third attempt, being accepted to service. However, on the next order, consisting of two eggs, two pancakes, and two orders of bacon and sausage, Nicole began to stall out on eggs, with Tem muttering in her confessional of how she doesn’t have time to dawdle like they’re fragile; eggs are not like vases, she presumed. Tem would warn Nicole that her and Sierra’s pancakes are going up, and Nicole would ask Tem to wait another ‘fucking minute’, much to Ramsay’s ire, telling the ladies to get a grip. Shayna would try to lead with her eggs, but Nicole would tell her she still isn’t ready, and Allison would go and inspect; they seem to be looking perfect, and she would ask in her confessional what in the hell is going on, wondering if she’s really that deluded. With everything up on the pass, Ramsay would tell them he’s got perfect eggs, but burnt pancakes that look like ‘Stone Age’ wheels will never work, and tells the ladies to communicate better, as he does not want anyone to walk out the front doors without their jackets, because he’s more than welcome to. Shayna would continue to step up as a leader, telling the Eggs and Pancakes, as well as the Meat, stations to listen well, and ask for call times, while Nicole would huff in her confessional of how all she said was she needed extra time on her eggs, and state Shayna didn’t need to get all saucy, comparing her to Tem a bit. Meanwhile, the Meat station was having an easier time, bacon and sausage being cooked well by Kara and Wanda. 

Over in the Blue Kitchen, Ramsay would call their first order for breakfast; three eggs, two pancakes, and one sausage. Henri would state in his confessional that he’s been cooking tons of breakfast on the cruises he’s been on; it’s actually routine. But as he’s being vocal to everyone and impressing Ramsay with his skills, one order later, his scrambled eggs are pulled back from the pass, as Ramsay asks everyone to taste them, mockingly telling them to dig into the most simple breakfast ever. He asks everyone why he called it simple, and without skipping a beat, he’d answer that there’s no seasoning to be seen at all. He demands Henri to answer why he’s an executive chef on a cruise ship that can’t get anything basic; Henri apologizes to him, but Ramsay orders him to start from scratch on the double. Samuel would make a confessional, stating that he has friends and colleagues who’ve worked in the army, and no matter who they are, he always wants to prove to them they’ll get the best food yet. Samuel would help Henri with the refire, and the eggs would be re-accepted. But one ticket later, consisting of one egg, two pancakes, and one crepe, JC’s crepe were sent back after being compared to how floppy like paper they were. Additionally, another egg was sent back for being too yolky; this time it was Samuel’s fault, who admitted to doing so, and Ramsay would order Samuel to do a much better job at cooking the shit he’s making, or he’s gonna lock him to a ball and chain, and telling JC that applies to him. JC would awkwardly chuckle in his confessional that Ramsay’s got no chill, especially when he wakes up with coffee in his hand. Thankfully, their orders would be accepted and sent out to service. 

Back in the Red Kitchen, there was another order of two eggs, two bacon, and Kara would try to coordinate with the Eggs station on how long they’ll be done. Allison would respond to her that she’s got it under control, and give her two minutes. Upon walking up to the pass, however, Ramsay would tell Allison that the scrambled eggs he received were still runny; there are chicks still chirping. Nicole would make a wiseass remark to Allison, to which Allison made a confessional, lecturing Nicole not to call her out when she didn’t even think to come and assist her; they’re on the same station, and they had to work together as a team, clapping the last few words in her sentence to emphasize her point. Thankfully, the refire was accepted, but then came an order of one egg, two crepes, to which Isabela said in her confessional that making crepes wasn’t something she quite mastered in the culinary world. Nicole was able to coordinate with Dani and Isabela, but upon sending the items up, Ramsay asked why one crepe is cooked perfectly, while the other is a sizzling, burnt piece of shit. Isabela admits fault to the burnt one, and after she receives a Gordon Ramsay chewing, they are forced to start over. Thankfully, Isabela’s second attempt was re-accepted, but Nicole’s eggs were sent back this time due to them being too raw. Tem would scoff, “*Yeah, and I rush stuff*,” but that was at a volume loud enough for certain people to hear, and Nicole would tell her to butt out; this isn’t her mess to deal with, and to stay the fuck out of it, muttering how she always has a bone to pick with her. She followed it up in her confessional asking Tem if pancakes were on the ticket; no, and if she can’t do anything helpful, then to go back and get tattoo’d up her ‘V-card’. Thankfully, the women’s third attempt on the ticket would be reaccepted, with perfectly cooked eggs and crepes. 

While things in the Red Kitchen were getting crispy hot, the Blue Kitchen was trying to keep their stovetop atmosphere at bay, with Ramsay calling for another order of one scrambled eggs, two crepes, and two orders of bacon. However, the Meat station began to have some difficulty, as Ruben wasn’t communicating back with Henri nor JC, and when Ramsay ordered Ruben to talk, Ruben would sigh and respond with an inaccurate time call, with Henri correcting him that his eggs were almost done. Ruben would roll his eyes in response and take his bacon up to the pass, only for Ramsay to tell them that the bacon’s now reduced to broken pieces of pork belly, mentioning how that pig’s now dead. He asks Ruben what his deal is, and why he is insistent on going on his own terms, and Ruben argues that he isn’t; he just wants to finish service. Ramsay warns him that he expects him to work the way the rest of his team wants to, and orders him (as well as the Eggs and Crepes stations) to start over. Ramsay would temporarily step out of the Blue Kitchen and back into the Red Kitchen, leaving Sous Chef James in charge. However, things didn’t go smoothly either, as Ruben now served up raw bacon, with James telling him they’ve barely been cooked. He tells Ruben to start over once more, and orders Rio to check on his ’little buddy’. Ruben, however, was less than pleased by this instruction from the sous chef, and he would make it clear in his confessional of how he doesn’t want that ‘tryhard’ breathing down his spine. Rio would try to give him orders, but Ruben would ignore it, disguising it as lazily going along with his stationmate. And upon sending up burnt bacon again, an irritated James would demand to know what’s wrong with Ruben, and order him to get a grip, or the next failure he sends up will be his last. Ruben would fire back the dreaded six words no one wants to hear: “*You’re not the boss of me!*”, stunning everyone else. Rio would mutter in his confessional of how talking back to Ramsay is one no-no, but talking back to a sous chef, Ramsay’s righthand, is a special type of no-no that really shouldn’t be done. James, now pissed, would call out to Ruben, who turned his back trying to get back to his station, and ordered him out of the kitchen. Ruben tried to tell him off, but James insisted, with other team members telling the stubborn chef to leave, and Samuel to state in his confessional of how Ruben’s not doing anything right all morning, and that includes not even leaving the kitchen. James would call for Ramsay, and ask if he has permission to kick Ruben out, and Ramsay, not even believing it to be a trick question, would remind James he doesn’t need his permission; of course he can kick out a chef. He turns to Ruben, who finally sees he’s outnumbered, and tells him he heard James, and to get out of the kitchen. Ruben would roll his eyes and storm back to the dorms, with him shaking his head in his confessional, wondering who made ‘Jamie Boy’ in charge of the kitchen, because last he checked, Ramsay was the one calling the shots. James and Ramsay would order Freddie to get on the Meat station, and to start cooking the bacon for the order. Thankfully, Freddie’s bacon would be perfectly cooked, and he’d send it up to the pass no problem. The Blue Team would continue to cruise through breakfast orders, with minimal trouble; though Samuel would accidentally send up a runny scrambled egg on one order, while Edward would send up a raw pancake that Ramsay would call a flopjack, with Edward stating that his father and Amanda had taught him how to cook many foods, but he barely has ever taught how to cook pancakes, though he does contradict himself, stating that everything he cooked so far this morning was fine. 

The teams were getting down by the wire, with both teams with a few more tickets left; 3 for the Blue Team, and 2 for the Red. Ramsay made sure to let both teams know about the current situation, and he would instruct the Blue Team to pick up the pace. Freddie would rally the team some more while putting down a pan full of bacon, and he would mention in his confessional that just because Ruben is out of commission doesn’t mean that they should be out as well. Thanks to Freddie’s voice, David’s quick-thinking, and Henri’s initiative, they would push one more order out onto the pass. Back in the Red Kitchen, they were whipping up another order of eggs, sausage, and crepes, and Kara would say in her confessional that she could smell yet another challenge victory… However, Ramsay would come back with another dish of eggs, and this time, Allison was the one who fumbled the bag on them, noting how burnt they were. This was frustrating to Nicole, as she would vent in her confessional of how they can’t screw it up already, and says Allison has a brain, like everyone else, and to use it. Allison would scramble to make yet another fresh batch of scrambled eggs, and with Isabela’s crepe sent up to the pass, it seemed as if they were one ticket closer. However, Ramsay would come back and tell everyone to touch the crepe… it was like one of the worst soft tortillas he’s ever touched, and asks Isabela if that’s really her best. Isabela declined, and she would sigh in her confessional of how difficult the pressure is, and she’s got to get her act together. With the Red Team having to redo the order, Nicole would try taking initiative; however, her variant of taking charge and being a leader would consist of barking out orders, albeit a bit aggressively, making Kara shake her head in her confessional of how Nicole scares her when she’s angry. Her anger attracted Michelle, who warned her to take it down a notch, and also made Tem speak in her confessional, “*And she says I’m the one with an attitude problem?*”. Meanwhile, the Blue Team were down to their last order, and they were looking for one scrambled eggs, one crepe, two pancakes, and two bacon, and Samuel, seeing this as their way forward to victory, would boldly lead the charge by asking for call times to everyone; he would mention in his confessional of how they’re close… so close! With Freddie and Rio working on the bacon, as well as Edward doing double overtime on the pancakes, they were getting everything set… Freddie would jokingly warn Edward to be careful, and Edward chuckles along, with him saying in his confessional that he understands that this is all a challenge, but rushing to get food cooked has its risks; both in terms of the quality of the food, but also the mental state of someone. When everyone set the food up to the pass, Ramsay would accept them all, and call for the waitstaff to send them out to service, the Blue Team finishing the challenge upon completing their last ticket. Meanwhile, the Red Team were busy trying to finish their final ticket, which consisted of two eggs, one crepe, one pancake, and two sausages, when they heard the Blue Team celebrating, with Ramsay going to their kitchen to confirm what they were hearing. The Red Team were visibly stunned upon hearing this news; some looking blue, but one taking it very badly; Nicole would kick one of the bins out of anger and curse, only for Ramsay to school her for her frustrations, as well as not focusing on her eggs, telling her, as well as Allison and Shayna to finish their eggs or they’ll be kicking sand on the beach. Shayna would mournfully say in her confessional of how close they were to winning; if it hadn’t been those few remaining issues they had, they would’ve won.

1oddaa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyFromEU/comments/1oddaa3/invitation_to_all_of_us_keep_openstreetmap/,Invitation to ALL of us: keep openstreetmap up-to-date easily,"Most European alternatives for Google maps, are based on openstreetmap. As others mentioned before, maybe the best way to deGoogle and give **European maps** (like Mapy, CoMaps, Organic Maps, Locus Map) a chance, is by contributing to **openstreetmaps** (OSM).

Two important factors that hinder the growth of European maps are:

1.  lack of relevant POI data in OSM
2.  presence of **outdated** information (which is often overlooked) in OSM.

The good news: there are some very simple and foolproof ways how **everyone of us** , also without technical skills, can help improving European maps, at least for your own city and favorite POI's. 🇪🇺💪

A. With [**every-door app**](https://every-door.app):

* Open an account on [**openstreetmap.org**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) (free).
* Download the Every Door app and log in with your account (settings page).
* Open the amenities tab (the coffee cup. Other tabs are less relevant), zoom in on your area, and update the area info (red bar).
* Check whether the businesses and other POIs displayed still exist and have the same name (and other info, if you like). Entities with a yellow border were updated more than 5 years ago, so it is a good idea to focus on these.
* Add missing companies/entities. Focus on organizations that are most relevant for navigation (i.e., more visitors = more relevant).
* Don't forget to upload. That's it.
* Keep doing this whenever you're somewhere else ;)

B. With [**Mapcomplete**.org](https://mapcomplete.org) (thematic maps, but no app)

* Use/create account on openstreetmap (free).
* Check and update for a submap of your interest.

C. With [**Streetcomplete**.app](http://openstreetmap.org) (android) or [**vespucci**.io](https://vespucci.io/) (android)

* Also with openstreetmap account.
* Further I don't know, I don't have android. But maybe others can tell in the comments.

D. Using [**Overpass Turbo**](https://overpass-turbo.eu) to find outdated POI's.

* Overpass Turbo basically is an advanced search tool / query, for example useful to find POI's that were updated only long time ago.
* I made an example ( [overpass-turbo.eu/s/2e72](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/2e72) ) you can use and change to suit your needs. example: data points in Scotland, last updated > 15y ago, and some types excluded. Modify area, date (3x) and if necessary the excluded items, and press 'Run' again. Then start adressing checking these with the tools mentioned at 1, 2, 3 or 5.
* You can also make other scripts, even without knowledge of scripts and queries (like I did), simply ask [LeChat](https://chat.mistral.ai) (by Mistral) or [Lumo (by Proton)](https://lumo.proton.me)

E. Directly at **openstreetmap** or other more advanced programs like JOSM.

F. Motivate others (including businesses) to also update their own neighborhood or business.

I currently go to school in the Eastern US, but attended high school overseas. Summer 2024, when I went to visit my family, I met up with my senior prom date\* for coffee and caught feelings something awful. The problem was that he was not due to leave the country for another year, and given the massive time difference, I did not pursue my feelings.

Over the past year, I have had one (short-lived) fling and turned down a few dating propositions. Most of the reason I have turned these guys down is that I'm still smitten with my friend.

He is now attending college on the West Coast. While this is much closer than before, he's still a whole continent away; our only means of communication is occasional texts. I want so desperately to confess my feelings, but don't want to a) ruin our friendship; b) put my foot in my mouth; c) expend energy into something that will probably not pan out logistically.

What do I do? I can't get over him, and it's driving me slowly insane.

\*We went to prom as friends. He did not ask me out romantically. This was ideal at the time, because while I found him attractive, I had recently left a terrible relationship and wanted to take a break from dating.",1,1761150975.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1odd8u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1odd8u4/i_ghosted_my_dying_grandma/,I ghosted my dying Grandma.,"**Context-** I was raised by a single mother and her family. Up until I was about 7 years old, I didn't even think I had a father. Maybe I thought children were actually delivered by storks, or that I just appeared one day under my Mom's pillow, but it wasn't until kids at school started asking me about my dad that I started to question why I didn't have one. Never met him, never spoken to him, no cards, no calls and no contact. Didn't even know his name or what he looked like. I was also too ashamed of being a bastard to ask my Mom for details, so I lived most of my life not knowing any names or faces from my Dad's side of the family. Fast forward now and I'm 25. Still don't know my real dad's name or face. For all I knew, these people didn't exist. Until two years ago.

**The story of ghosting my grandma-** One random day two years ago, my Mom comes to me and says something along the lines of, ""Some lady reached out to me on Facebook, I think she's your Grandma."" Which you could imagine was a pretty shocking thing to hear all the sudden, after 23 years of not even knowing I had another Grandma. So I reply, ""Really? That's weird. What did she want?"" And my Mom says she wanted to speak to me.

So, cool I guess. I paused whatever game I was playing at the time and told my Mom to call this alleged ""Grandma"", who's name I did not know. Phone starts to ring. While it's ringing, I'm sitting there not really knowing what to expect. I was kind of annoyed, kind of amused, and not the slightest bit nervous. I'm not exactly sure what mix of emotions I was feeling honestly, but I didn't have too much time to understand them before someone picked up the phone....

Now I can't remember exactly what was said for most of the phone call, because almost as soon as she started speaking, I broke down into tears. Honest to God, I didn't think I would cry, but man I was like a baby. So much so, that I maybe said 2 words the entire phone call. My Mom ended up doing most of the talking while I just sat there listening with my face buried in my sleeve.

Anyways, to summarize the phone call, this woman who claimed to be my grandma was old, very sick and probably dying. She said that over the past 23 years, she's been trying to find a way to contact me but never could find me... (which is bullshit but I digress).... but now she was able to find me and wanted to apologize and meet her Grandson in person. In my hysterical state, I actually said okay. I would meet this woman and give her the peace of mind she was asking for. So we arranged for a day that week so we would meet at a coffee shop near my house.

And then the day came and I never showed up.

And she never contacted me again.

  
**Final thoughts-** I didn't ghost her deliberately, or out of malice. Sure, I might feel justified for doing so, because of the nature of our relationship... but the reality is that there's a lot of pain there for me that I didn't think existed. Every fiber in my body and soul that day was telling me not to go. Not to pick up the phone for her again. It was easier to just avoid her, and so I did. My life is just fine and always has been, and I'm certain that inviting these people into my life after all these years will bring me nothing but pain. As far as I'm concerned, they are strangers, and I don't owe them anything. I'm not mad that she reached out, but I do hope this discourages anyone else from that side of the family from reaching out to me ever again.

I've been at this job for like 3 years. Small office, maybe 15 people total. We have a kitchen area with a coffee maker and everyone either brings their own mug or uses the random office mugs in the cabinet.

I have this mug. Had. Had this mug. It was handmade ceramic, my sister made it for me when she was doing pottery classes. It had a really specific glaze color (like a dark teal) and she'd carved my initial into it. It was honestly really nice and I used it every single day. Kept it in my desk drawer, brought it to the kitchen when I needed coffee, washed it, brought it back to my desk.

My coworker Diane started about 8 months ago. She's fine I guess. Mid 40s, kinda chatty, whatever. Not really friends but we're friendly.

About 4 months ago I notice my mug isn't in my drawer where I left it. I find it in the kitchen sink. Unwashed. With coffee residue in it. I'm annoyed but I figure someone grabbed the wrong mug by mistake, wash it, bring it back to my desk.

Happens again like a week later. Then again. I start noticing it's always when Diane is in early. I mention it to another coworker and she's like ""oh yeah Diane uses whatever mug is around""

So I talk to Diane. Super casual. ""hey I noticed my mug keeps ending up in the kitchen, it's the teal one with the J on it. That's my personal one I keep at my desk, can you use one of the office mugs instead?""

She's like ""oh sure no problem! it's so pretty I didn't realize it was special""

Cool. Done. Right?

No.

It keeps happening. I find my mug in the kitchen like 3 more times over the next month. Each time I bring it up to Diane and she apologizes and says she forgot. At this point I'm getting actually annoyed because come on. It's not that hard to remember.

I start hiding my mug in my desk in a different spot. Doesn't matter. She still finds it somehow? I don't know if she's going through my desk or what but it keeps disappearing.

Two weeks ago I come in and my mug is shattered. Like fully shattered. In the kitchen sink. In multiple pieces.

I'm upset because again my sister made this and I can't just get another one. I ask around and nobody knows what happened. Finally Diane comes in late (she had a dentist appointment or something) and I'm like ""Diane did you break my mug?""

Her: ""oh my god yes I'm so sorry! I dropped it this morning before I left for my appointment. I meant to clean it up but I was running late""

Me: ""why were you using it again? I've asked you like five times not to use my mug""

Her: ""I know I'm sorry I just. the office mugs are all stained and gross and yours is always so clean""

Me: ""because I take care of it. and now it's broken.""

Her: ""I said I'm sorry! I'll replace it""

Okay so. I'm still mad but at least she's offering to replace it. I tell her it was handmade and she can't really replace it exactly but I appreciate the gesture.

Last Friday she brings me a mug. From Target. It's teal but like. bright aqua teal. Nothing like mine. It's got ""COFFEE QUEEN"" printed on it in cursive font. And it's ceramic but obviously mass produced.

Her: ""I found one that's close! We're even now right?""

Me: ""Diane this is. it's not really the same. mine was handmade by my sister""

Her: ""I mean it's still teal and it holds coffee. Plus this one was $15, pretty nice right?""

Me: ""that's not really the point""

Her: ""well I'm not made of money, I can't afford some fancy custom mug. I replaced it like I said I would""

And she walks away like the matter is settled.

I'm sitting there with this ""COFFEE QUEEN"" mug that I would never buy in a million years and my actual mug is in a garbage bag in pieces.

I talked to my boss about it but she kinda shrugged and said ""accidents happen"" and suggested I keep my personal items locked up if I don't want people using them.

So now I bring my mug from home every day and take it home every night because apparently I can't trust grown adults not to go through my desk and use my stuff.

Diane keeps asking if I'm still mad and saying she ""more than made up for it"" because the replacement mug was $15.

My sister was actually pretty upset when I told her because she was really proud of that mug. It took her like 3 tries to get the glaze right.

I know it's just a mug but like. I asked her so many times to stop using it. SO many times. And she kept doing it until she broke it. And now acts like buying me a random Target mug makes it okay.

It doesnt reflect the entirety of my marriage. 

My husband hurt his knee. Im not sure how.  Im not sure when. But for at least a month. I know its been at least a minth because he has a physical on this date in septwmber and he mentioned it to his doctor. Mentioned. 

now he's been walking with a limp. A limp so visible that the lady at the coffee shop asked me about it when he wasnt there. The neighbors ask about him, why he's limping. 

Sometimes he says its not ""painful"" it just feels really tight. Other times he says it just plain hurts.  Now I believe there IS something wrong. I believe he tore or stretched out his tendon/ligament. It gets swollen too. I believe its uncomfortable. But my God he's like a dog that got its leg run over by a car.  Makes no attempt to hide it. Im not sure why it bugs me so much but it does. And the kicker? He refuses to use Tylenol or motrin. He thinks continual use will kill his organs. And when he does, he takes like 100mgs at a time.   I want to scream ""there are women who take ibuprofen like candy monthly and they are doing just fine"".

I (26) have been with my girlfriend (21) for 2 years now.

We met at work and very quickly hit it off as we were very attracted to each other, however both of us were also in a desperate spot.

She is a trans woman that was running away from her house and from every person she ever dated telling her she will never be loved. 

I had just finished a very abusive relationship of 7 years me and my ex were in an on and off situation, me not being able to help her with her multiple mental health issues that were diagnosed and under treatment, multiple suicide attempts from her part, humiliation from both parts, manipulation from both parts.

Anyway, both of us felt extremely unlovable and I in fact was trying to just keep myself alive with this new job, it was her first job since she dropped out of university.

We had a lot of fun in the first couple of dates we went on, kind of instantly fell in love, started having her at my house more often, and then we both decided to move in to my house (Lesbian style, after 1 month of knowing each other).  

About 2 weeks after we moves in together she got let go from her job, as she was dealing with depression and for 2 days could not leave the bed in a reasonable manner.

I assured her this was ok and we would be fine, she can stay for as long as necessary, while still looking for other jobs, which turned out to be very hard, as she is both inexperienced and started her transition less than a year ago, so cis passing is not 100% yet.

I made sure to tell her I'm comfortable having her in my house, I love her and having her around all the time. At times we would have too much fun, and I would miss work for about a week out of the entire month.

This means I feel guilty for not going to work, she feels guilty for not being responsible when I need to put a limit to fun times, and trying to tell me that I need to take care of my job, and as she does not have any responsibilities, she can stay up and play videogames with her (incredibly shitty and manipulative) friends.

I argued about this and made passive aggressive comments stating if she is staying up so am I, and that we all need to be responsible.

This of course caused her to feel trapped as she feels stuck at home, guilty for not having a job, and feeling like I'm getting between her friends, which was not untrue.

She eventually got a job with her sister at a vegetable stand, not too much money but still enough for us to buy weed and fast food almost every night.

Eventually she lost this job as her sister is a literal psychopath and would make her life complete hell.

Back again to feeling guilty about unemployment, I always made sure I understand but she does not need to feel guilty or embarrassed, as I understand the situation she is in.

Eventually she starts going out more and more, bringing some friends home, which bothered me a lot, I do not like people in my house, specially people I do not know.

I made sure she understood this in an incredibly emotionally manipulative way, and during one of these breakdowns, while she was outside of the house, after multiple attempts of calling her and telling her to come home, I ripped hair from my head and destroyed a couch by punching it, not pretty and honestly she should have left me right then and there.

We stayed together for a couple of months after this, as I understood this was not ok, and we also enjoyed esch other's company a lot. 

Eventually however after multiple tired days at work where I did not enjoy myself, I woke up crying and asked her if we're gonna be ok, if she sees a future with me, and if she still loves me. She did not answer these questions, and I left for work. About 2 hours after this, I receive a message from her saying she cannot do this anymore and she is leaving for her mom's house for a couple of days.

I get completely heartbroken by this, and leave work to go home to try and stop her while she is packing. By the time I got there she already left with most of her things including a guitar she had gifted me.

I felt lost and confused, I thought we were getting better and we could overcome this.

She felt different, saying she never knew the exact cause of the couch incident, scared I may be physically violent towards her and she decided that leaving in that moment was the safest and best decision for her. However she did come to my house after I told her I feel very alone and need some help and further explanation about this.

Initially I thought this was done to hurt me, because I  did not understand the reason for her to go no contact for about a week after this.

During this week I went to see my mother and family in another city about 6 hours away, felt incredibly lonely there as well.

When I went back, we met up in public where I was very happy to see her and to move forward with our relationship, she however wanted to meet up just to tell me we are breaking up.

I talked to her about us, our relationship, and how the couch was always meant to be me, my intrusive thoughts, and me trying to stop them from happening.

We decided we would keep trying with this relationship, and went back to my house, where almost immediately she talked to one of her very shitty and manipulative friends, and decided to break up, but only after having sex with me on the same couch I broke.

We spent the whole day together trying to talk things through, saying how we would be able to move on and still stay in each other's life.

I accepted this change and realized the way to keep her in my life, in a romantic relationship or not, was to better. 

And so as if by magic I suddenly felt very motivated to become a better person that is not as possessive or controlling.

We saw each other for dates a couple of times, and after 3 weeks, she asked me to go back together again.
I was unsure if I accepted at first, thinking I am still working on myself and this feels too rushed, but of course, I accepted and got very happy that my girlfriend is now once again officially my girlfriend.

Some time passes and the house I live in starts to show signs of bad moisture and mold, we talked to the landlord who did not want to fix it, and offered us to leave to another house if necessary.

We moved to her mother's house, almost.
Her mother's house has a very big house and a tiny studio apartment no one uses, we moved in there.

Some of the best months of my life were lived there, she started cooking school as she fell in love with the kitchen and expressing her love through this, bakery, lactoferments, coffee making, among other things.

We were the happiest we had ever been so far, feeling like I am actually getting ahead in life both in my professional career and her with her studies.

Over time the friendly mom and mother in law started to let her guard down and showed her true colors. We were there as a favor (we paid rent every month), we did not help her enough with her grand daughter (which she decided to legally take away from the mother and raise her as her own daughter, at 60 years old) we also were asking too much of her when it comes to the house (we asked for simple fixes in the house, as before us it was abandoned and some of the doors were not secured, windows leaking during rain, etc.) all of this while not being a mother to my girlfriend at all.

We started looking for another apartment, the contract on this one was about to expire in 2 months.
We found one apartment we really liked, closer to everything we need, her cooking institute, my job, and overall a better part of the city.

Moved in somewhat rushed, but very happy.
We quickly started making this place our own, decorating and making projects to improve the house.
It is a very nice apartment full of customization and very cozy 

She started working with her dad on his company, cooking privately for a client, and trying to start her own business, selling homemade food.

We were very happy, however this is written only 3 months after we moved here.

Quickly she felt stuck at home again, started to see her friends more often and got in contact with an old friend that is currently battling depression and drug abuse.

All of these things made me go back to square one where I tried to convince her to not go with her friend as she is in a bad, self destructive state, and she should take distance from them.

Multiple arguments were had about how to take care of the house and at one point she had to put her business in pause because one of our cats fell very ill and almost died, requiring very expensive treatment.

I'm not entirely sure how to share this last part, but she wanted me to go to therapy, her to move out to her dad's, and to have a more distant relationship.

I initially hated this idea and wanted to break up, I did not understand the reason for moving away. I did come to terms with it and was planning on helping with her house at her dad's, going to visit her, have her visit me, normal adult life relationship things.

However I had the incredibly dumb idea of telling her that to be in a relationship with me, she must take into consideration that I need attention and we would need to talk all day, and see each other every week.

This is when she decided she does not want that and I will not get better as long as she stays in contact with me, and we should break up.

After multiple hours of trying to explain myself and basically begging for her forgiveness, she packed a bag and left. 

While she did that we sat down, now calmer, and talked about how she understands I am not an abusive person but I have abusive patterns, and over all she does not regret anything from our relationship because both of us grew so much and felt so incredibly happy.

The consensus is that we are taking a break, I am unsure of how long or if it's even a break, we might never go back together again.

I had to promise her that I would not hurt myself, which will be very difficult, but I will do my best.

She also promised the same and said she would take care of herself, and then left.

Now I am all alone in our bed, not knowing exactly how to feel, what to expect from the future, from myself, or if I should even keep myself alive.

The dormant asphalt and echoing corridors of Exton Square Mall are stepping aside for something bigger: a living town core—homes, retail, health, and daily life stitched together in one address. After months of debate, West Whiteland’s planning commission unanimously backed the revised plan to transform the 75-acre site into a mixed-use town center, pushing the project to the Board of Supervisors and signaling that the “someday” phase is over. Momentum is here.  
Developers adjusted the blueprint to win support—more public space, a central pedestrian spine, and a residential program that now includes a 165-unit active-adult building alongside apartments and a reworked mix of for-sale options. When you add open space and a real street through the middle, value doesn’t just rise on site—it ripples into every block within a five-minute drive.  
The timeline matters. Early site work is now positioned for 2026 with a freestanding Main Line Health building kicking off phase one, before full mall demolition, which is currently projected for summer 2027. Smart buyers and investors treat this as a two-stage opportunity: anticipation premium into activation; lifestyle premium as streets, cafés, and trail connections go live.  
Supervisors have flagged density, sewer capacity, and historic-resource questions—healthy friction before final approvals. Watch the sequence: conditional use, infrastructure commitments, phasing tweaks.  
Walkability is a comp multiplier. Homes within a 1–2 mile ring of a real town center typically see lower DOM and stickier pricing. For Chester County, this is the missing chapter: errands, healthcare, coffee, and community in one walkable core.  
**Signals to watch:** brisk pre-leasing; health anchor open on schedule; pedestrian corridor + first café within the first winter after groundbreaking. Conversely: any stall in infrastructure/historic mitigation = slower absorption, not broken thesis.  
**Practical lens:**  
• Investors: think in rings (0–0.5 mi earliest premium; 0.5–1.0 mi follows; 1–2 mi halo).  
• Sellers: list into visible phase milestones for better photography & narrative.  
• Buyers/downsizers: older homes inside the halo with smart updates can outperform newer but isolated product; active-adult component suggests true ground-floor living near amenities.

The Missouri State Bears (3-3) and New Mexico State Aggies (3-3) are set for a Conference USA clash in Las Cruces, where the temperature might be hotter than the rivalry. With Missouri State favored by a mere 1.5 points and the over/under set at 50.5, this game promises to be as close as a deadlocked jury. Let’s break it down with the precision of a quarterback’s spiral and the humor of a punter’s shanked kick.

**Odds & Ends: The Numbers Don’t Lie**  
The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates games 10,000 times (presumably while sipping coffee and muttering to itself), predicts 54 combined points—favoring the *Over*—and claims a 70% hit rate on its spread picks. Missouri State’s senior running back, Shomari Lawrence, is a beast, averaging 5.7 yards per carry like a bull in a china shop (though preferably *with* the china). Quarterback Logan Fife, meanwhile, has thrown for 1,514 yards and eight touchdowns, proving he’s no stranger to the end zone—unless he’s tripping over his own cleats.

On the Aggies’ side, junior receiver Donovan Faupel is a highlight-reel threat with 363 receiving yards and two touchdowns. New Mexico State’s offense? It’s like a posse of wide receivers with a “Just Keep Hiring Me” attitude—four players have surpassed 200 receiving yards. The Aggies are also 2-0 ATS as home underdogs this season, suggesting they thrive on the underdog narrative like a Netflix series no one wants to admit they binge-watched.

**Injury Report: No Major Drama, Just Minor Chaos**  
No major injuries are reported for either team, which is surprising given Missouri State’s QB, Logan Fife, already has enough pressure without a trip over his own shoelaces (a fate that befell a star striker

1odd1a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthandlifetips/comments/1odd1a9/trending_hearthealthy_foods_pune_residents_are/,Trending heart-healthy foods Pune residents are adopting,"Over the last few years, Pune has transformed into one of India’s most health-conscious cities. Once known mainly for its education and IT hubs, Pune is now making headlines for its growing wellness culture. From the green cafes in Baner to the early morning joggers in Aundh, there’s a visible shift — people are prioritizing **heart health** like never before.

This change isn’t sudden. With rising cases of **cholesterol, hypertension, and early-age heart disease**, residents are realizing that prevention starts with food. And leading this awareness are experts like **Dr. Pravin Pawal**, a trusted [cardiologist near in Baner](https://share.google/qBj8Of8oeXctO3Ykz), who emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet for long-term cardiovascular health.

“Food is your first medicine,” says Dr. Pawal. “When you eat right, exercise regularly, and manage stress, you’re already reducing your heart disease risk by more than half.”

So, what exactly are Punekars eating in 2025 to protect their hearts? Let’s explore the **most trending heart-healthy foods** that are quietly revolutionizing local diets — from modern superfoods to traditional staples making a comeback.

# Millets — The Ancient Grain Making a Comeback

If there’s one food trend that’s here to stay, it’s millets. Once considered “poor man’s food,” millets like **jowar, bajra, and ragi** are now being celebrated for their **heart-protective properties**.

High in fiber and magnesium, these grains help control **cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammation**, making them perfect for people prone to heart disease. Even Pune’s popular restaurants — from Aundh’s organic cafes to Baner’s vegan spots — are offering millet pancakes, millet thalis, and millet dosa as healthy alternatives.

**Why it works:**

* Keeps you full for longer (prevents overeating)
* Stabilizes blood sugar, reducing stress on the heart
* Gluten-free and easy to digest

Cardiologists like Dr. Pawal recommend adding at least one millet-based meal daily for sustainable heart health.

# Cold-Pressed Oils — Replacing Refined Oils

Refined oils may be cheap and widely available, but they’re stripped of their nutrients during processing. In contrast, **cold-pressed oils** such as groundnut, mustard, sesame, and olive oil retain their natural antioxidants and monounsaturated fats.

These fats are **heart-friendly**, helping to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) while increasing good cholesterol (HDL).

**Pro Tip from Dr. Pawal:**

“Don’t fear fats. Just switch to the right kind — cold-pressed and used in moderation.”

Pune’s local markets now stock small-batch cold-pressed oils, and urban families are incorporating them into everyday cooking, from sabzis to salad dressings.

# Omega-3 Powerhouses — Flaxseeds, Walnuts, and Fish

Omega-3 fatty acids are the unsung heroes of heart health. They reduce inflammation, prevent plaque buildup, and keep blood pressure in check.

Vegetarian Pune residents are turning to **flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts**, while non-vegetarians are adding **salmon, sardines, and tuna** to their weekly menus. Even local dieticians are suggesting adding a teaspoon of ground flaxseed to morning smoothies or oats bowls.

**Why it’s trending:**

* Proven to lower triglycerides
* Reduces heart rhythm irregularities
* Improves brain and joint health too

# Fermented Foods — The Gut-Heart Connection

Pune’s wellness experts are now talking about the **gut-heart axis** — how gut bacteria impact cardiovascular function. Fermented foods like **curd, kefir, kombucha, kimchi, and fermented pickles** are making their way into Pune kitchens.

These foods help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which influences cholesterol absorption, blood pressure, and even inflammation.

**Local twist:** Homemade *dahi* or *kanji* made with beets and carrots is becoming a staple among health-conscious Punekars.

# The Rise of Berries and Antioxidant Fruits

Antioxidants are your body’s natural defense against oxidative stress — one of the main causes of arterial damage. Fruits like **blueberries, strawberries, cranberries, and black grapes** are gaining popularity in Pune’s supermarkets and fruit shops.

Paired with oatmeal or yogurt, these fruits provide a burst of vitamin C, fiber, and polyphenols — all known to boost heart function.

**Budget-friendly local options:**

* *Amla (Indian gooseberry)* — excellent for cholesterol control
* *Guava and papaya* — rich in fiber and antioxidants

# Plant-Based Proteins — The Smart Meat Alternative

As plant-based eating becomes more mainstream, Pune residents are replacing red meat with **legumes, sprouts, tofu, paneer, and lentils**. These protein sources are lower in saturated fats and cholesterol.

Plant-based diets also reduce inflammation and improve lipid profiles, making them a perfect fit for people with a family history of heart problems.

**Popular local dishes:**

* Sprout chaat bowls at Baner cafes
* Tofu curries at plant-based restaurants in Aundh
* Protein smoothies using pea protein and almond milk

# Green Teas and Herbal Infusions

The caffeine-overload trend is declining, and herbal teas are taking center stage. **Green tea, hibiscus tea, tulsi tea, and chamomile** are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Hibiscus tea, in particular, has been linked to lower blood pressure levels. Many wellness stores in Pune now sell locally grown herbal blends designed for cardiovascular wellness.

**Pro Tip:** Replace one daily cup of coffee with green or hibiscus tea — your heart will thank you.

# Dark Chocolate — Indulgence with Benefits

Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) is one treat Punekars aren’t guilty about anymore. It’s loaded with flavonoids that **enhance blood vessel flexibility**, reduce blood pressure, and improve circulation.

Just one small square daily can contribute to heart health, but moderation remains key. Avoid sugary or milk-heavy chocolates, which cancel out the benefits.

# Infused Water — The Modern Way to Stay Hydrated

Hydration has evolved in 2025 — plain water has a twist now. **Cucumber-mint, lemon-basil, and orange-cinnamon infused waters** are not only refreshing but also rich in antioxidants and minerals.

These combinations encourage people to drink more water throughout the day, keeping blood viscosity optimal and aiding circulation.

**Bonus:** Infused water helps in detoxification, weight control, and glowing skin — all indirect contributors to a healthy heart.

# Smart Snacking with Nuts and Seeds

The corporate crowd in Baner and Balewadi is saying goodbye to processed snacks. Instead, **almonds, pistachios, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds** are becoming popular office snacks.

These are rich in **omega-3s, fiber, and plant sterols**, which naturally lower LDL cholesterol and prevent arterial blockages.

**Snack tip:** Combine roasted seeds with a handful of raisins for a sweet-and-salty trail mix that keeps your energy stable.

# Avocados and Exotic Superfoods Enter Pune’s Kitchens

Once rare, avocados, quinoa, and kale are now regulars in Pune’s supermarkets. Avocados are rich in **monounsaturated fats**, which lower bad cholesterol and keep arteries flexible.

Smoothie bowls, quinoa salads, and avocado toasts are not just trendy Instagram content — they’re part of a growing heart-conscious movement.

**Pro Tip:** Mash avocado with lemon juice and black pepper as a healthy spread alternative to butter.

# Turmeric — The Golden Heart Protector

Turmeric, or *haldi*, has always been part of Indian kitchens, but now, science backs its benefits. Curcumin — the active compound — has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that help **prevent plaque buildup in arteries**.

Turmeric lattes and *haldi doodh* are no longer just home remedies; they’re served at premium cafes across Pune as part of the modern “superfood” trend.

# Mindful Eating — The New Age Health Habit

Along with what they eat, Punekars are also focusing on **how they eat**. Mindful eating — slowing down, chewing thoroughly, and avoiding distractions — improves digestion and prevents overeating.

This lifestyle habit has proven cardiovascular benefits by stabilizing insulin levels and promoting better metabolism.

**Dr. Pawal’s advice:**

“Your heart health depends as much on your habits as your meals. A mindful meal is always better than a hurried one.”

# The Pune Advantage — Locally Grown, Fresh, and Seasonal

Pune has an edge when it comes to heart-healthy eating. Local produce markets and organic farms in areas like **Mulshi, Pirangut, and Talegaon** supply chemical-free vegetables, pulses, and fruits.

Eating **seasonally** not only supports local farmers but also ensures your body gets the right nutrients when it needs them most.

**Example:**

* *Winter*: Fresh spinach and carrots for antioxidants
* *Summer*: Cucumber and watermelon for hydration
* *Monsoon*: Bitter gourd and bottle gourd for liver detox

# Lifestyle Complements — The Bigger Picture

A heart-healthy diet alone isn’t enough. According to [Dr. Pravin Pawal](https://share.google/qBj8Of8oeXctO3Ykz), food works best when paired with an active, stress-free lifestyle.

He suggests:

* **30 minutes of brisk walking or yoga daily**
* **Adequate hydration (2.5–3 liters water/day)**
* **Sleep for at least 7 hours**
* **Regular heart check-ups every 6 months**

He adds, “The modern lifestyle often brings irregular eating patterns, processed foods, and long working hours. Balancing that with wholesome nutrition and regular checkups is crucial.”

# Conclusion: Food as the Foundation of a Healthy Heart

The evolving food culture in Pune reflects a deeper awareness — that health begins in the kitchen. From millet rotis to avocado smoothies, Punekars are combining tradition and innovation to keep their hearts strong.

As the saying goes, *“You are what you eat.”* And in Pune, people are choosing to be heart-strong, not just heart-smart.

For anyone serious about preventing heart disease or managing cholesterol naturally, a consultation with an experienced cardiologist is key.

If you’re searching for a **“Cardiologist near me in Baner”**, **Dr. Pravin Pawal** offers a patient-centric approach focused on preventive cardiology, nutrition, and long-term wellness. His guidance on combining medical care with lifestyle adjustments has helped many Pune residents lead healthier, happier lives.",2,1761150451.0,Healthandlifetips,1,1.0,False

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.

1odd0ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1odd0ud/11_lbs_lost_in_just_a_little_over_a_month_wish_i/,11 lbs lost in just a little over a month. Wish I discovered this sooner. Long vent.,"Just wanted to share my progress. I’m 38M. 6’. My starting weight was 274 lbs on Sept 15th, 2025. It is now Oct 22nd, 2025 and I’m now 263 lbs. I’m so proud of myself! I wish I had discovered this sooner. 

Long trauma dump ahead. You can stop reading if not interested. I just need to get this off my chest because I need to release it. It’s not my burden to carry anymore.

I’ve had a very difficult relationship with my body all my life. It was exacerbated by being a professional dancer. 

From 18 to 22, I worked in ballet and modern dance companies. I was always considered one of the ‘bigger’ male dancers. I’m naturally more muscular and tall. I was ridiculed constantly. I was an XL while all the other male dancers were M, S, XS. They had 29” to 32” waists. I didn’t. I was severely bullied by the other dancers. They used to call me the garbage disposal because I’d eat so much to fuel myself. But when you’re in a two hour company class at 10 am, rehearse for hours to then get ready for a show at night or teach classes, you need to eat! Those comments did get to me no matter how much I tried to laugh them off or ignore them.

If I stood up for myself, company directors would sign off on them by actively participating. It hurt like hell cus I was working so hard. If I wasn’t the right fit, why hire me at all? Was I just there to be a punching bag? It felt like a stupid cheesy movie plot but it’s so real. Being a dancer is harsh and comes with constant critiques of your body. Then you have all day to look at yourself in a mirror while getting said critiques to reinforce the crazy standard dancers put themselves through.

When you go see The Nutcracker, the opening scene is for the Christmas party. The dancers acting as the party parents often employ the trick of quietly cracking jokes to each other to make themselves laugh, smile and give the appearance of having a grand ol’ time. There were adult jokes, crass jokes, inside jokes. They also cracked jokes about me. “How much extra fabric did the costumer need to buy for you?”. Full grown adults. Grown men and women. 

They’d also crack jokes at the expense of developing children for being chunky. Mostly young girls of course. 🙄 They never said these jokes to the kids btw but that certainly didn’t stop them from telling some poor 15 year old girl in class to watch her weight as if she wasn’t already dancing for 2 hours every night and all day Saturday.

These people broke my spirit down and I relented. I wanted to prove to them that I was worthy of being taken seriously. So I started to severely limit my food intake. Every morning, I’d have a green apple and some coffee. I started smoking to curb hunger like the old school dancers did. I refused to eat in front of other dancers if I could help it. They noticed I wasn’t eating as much if at all and would say things like “Good job on the discipline.” or “You’re looking good.” when the weight loss became apparent. That shit stung. When I’d eventually have the smallest bite of a sandwich or wrap, they’d give me a side eye like they were saying “Oh, he’s about to fumble.” I was a nervous wreck from constantly being policed. 

The anxiety from that plus lack of nutrients messed with my mental health and decision making. I’d only allow myself to eat by going to dark parks at crazy times like 1 am so no one would see me. And certainly not the other dancers I lived with. At the time, the city I lived in was the murder capital of the USA. I shouldn’t have been fucking up my sleep schedule just to go eat at a park when people were getting shot left and right. But my mind wasn’t right. I felt like I had no other choice. I looked sickly and pale. People started accusing me of being on hard drugs when I just smoked cigarette’s. I was not ok.

The last straw came when a choreographer from NYC came to town to work with some of us my senior year of college. I was chosen alongside one other male dancer who really had it out for me. He was the ringleader. He was older than I was and at first acted like he was taking me under his wing as a mentor when I first joined the company at 18. I viewed his critiques and comments about my body as him looking out for me. He even invited me to live with him and his wife, a well respected and beloved dancer. If you’re involved in the dance world, you’ve for sure seen her picture. So I jumped at the chance to do so. But looking back, he’s what I now know to be a narcissist. I know, overused buzz word. But he totally was. His face would wince every time I got some sort of praise in class or after a show. It was subtle but I noticed. I’d get some recognition and he’d make some sly comment just to get under my skin. It was so catty. Like dude, grow a pair. It didn’t help that he was also choreographing a lot of our companies original works. I started to see that he only cast me to ridicule me over and over for his delight. No one ever said anything. They just accepted it or joined in. Of course the NYC choreographer wanted us to have visible abs. I was already spent. I had nothing else to give. One night, the other male dancer and I were pissed off and starving. It was late and he started to fix himself a bowl of cereal. He then turns around and set’s it down in front of me and says “Here cus I know you’ll eat it.”

So I did. I ate the damn bowl of cereal. He laughed. 

I was SO done. I broke. They won. Congrats to them.

I went upstairs and quietly packed my things. I wasn’t on the lease and just rented my room. I could just leave. The next morning, I sent the choreographer an email saying I wouldn’t be part of the production anymore. He never replied. I called my mom and told her I’m coming home TODAY. I skipped town. I blocked everyone’s phone numbers and emails. I deleted my Facebook and MySpace (dating myself 😆) with all those pictures of that time in my life. I was done.

3 years later, I met my now husband. I took him to meet my family for Thanksgiving and my aunt strolls in. God bless her but she’s a fucking weirdo and saves pictures from everyone’s social media pages. She had pictures of my time in the company. She pulled up a picture of me at my absolute worst. We both physically recoiled. He let out a “Oh, my god.”  I was gaunt and skeletal. How the hell did I ever think I needed to lose weight? What the hell was there to lose? How did I let these people get to my head so bad?

I don’t know how I ever got through that part of my life. Eager youth and a determination to prove people wrong. I genuinely love to perform so the fact that this was happened really left me heartbroken. I really thought I was surrounding myself with people who had the best intentions for me. I was so wrong. I love to dance still but dancers are absolute cunts. Lesson learned. I guess you could say the weight gain is from me being happy with my husband but I think it’s also related to the trauma of being in that environment. I feel just as out of control as I did then but on the opposite end. It’s harder to maintain weight as I’m pushing 40.

When I first started IF, I admit I felt like I was back to my starvation days. But it changed when I realized there was an end in sight. The time blocks really work for me. The kitchens open and then the kitchen closes. I also saw how I was keeping it a secret from my husband just like I did when I was eating at parks in the dark. But I don’t have to live like that anymore. Besides, secrets in marriages aren’t good at all. He’s 100% supportive.

I know there’s a science behind IF but I honestly don’t care to know it. I’m just glad I can lose weight and not feel like I’m hurting myself in the process. I have energy. I feel good. I feel lighter already. I’m walking and adding the gym to my routine. I’ll get back to a healthier weight by fueling the right way. As much as I like to see the numbers go down, I won’t put too much stock in them as an indicator of my self worth. I’m doing things the right way now. I can leave that part of my life behind me. The nasty parts anyways. There were good things I experienced as well so I’m going to take those with me. I won’t let them take everything.

Woof. That felt good to get off my chest. Good luck everyone. Happy fasting. Keep dancing. 💜 ",28,1761150425.0,intermittentfasting,7,0.92,False

The only real change is that I switched foods about two months ago. She initially had some diarrhea and discomfort then when using the box then. 

She then started going back in the box. Now, again, she’s started pooping outside the robot, both loose and normal stools. 

Interestingly she pees in the robot.  

The robot is also relatively clean except for some pee clumps from time to time. It is regularly emptied as well.

1odcvix,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1odcvix/how_does_coffee_consumption_impact_liver_health/,How Does Coffee Consumption Impact Liver Health?,"# Understanding Your Liver — The Silent Hero Inside You

Your liver works quietly every second of your life. You may not notice it, but it’s one of the hardest-working organs in your body. It helps in more ways than you can imagine:

* It **cleans your blood**, removing toxins and harmful substances.
* It **breaks down food**, turning it into energy.
* It **stores vitamins and minerals** for later use.
* It **fights infections** and helps your body stay strong.

In simple words — if your liver is healthy, your body feels light, energetic, and balanced. But if your liver gets tired or damaged, it can slowly lose its power, and many health problems can follow.

Liver diseases like **fatty liver**, **cirrhosis**, and **liver cancer** are becoming common worldwide. According to health surveys, almost **1 in every 4 adults** today suffers from some form of fatty liver disease — often without even knowing it.

But here’s the good news: a simple daily habit — **drinking coffee** — might be one of the easiest ways to keep your liver stronger and happier for years to come.

That’s not a myth — it’s a fact backed by global research, expert doctors, and millions of real people who have seen real results.

# What Science and Studies Say About Coffee and Liver Health

Let’s make it simple — many scientists around the world studied how coffee affects the liver. They didn’t just test a few people; they followed **hundreds of thousands of men and women** over years to find the truth.

Here’s what they discovered — in easy, clear language.

# ☕ Coffee and Liver Disease Risk

People who drink **2 to 4 cups of coffee every day** have a **40–50% lower chance** of developing serious liver problems like cirrhosis or liver failure compared to non-coffee drinkers.

That means your daily cup isn’t just a source of energy — it’s like a natural shield for your liver.

# ☕ Coffee and Fatty Liver

Studies found that coffee drinkers have a **lower chance of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**. And for people who already have fatty liver, regular coffee drinking may help **reduce the amount of fat** in the liver and **slow down scarring**.

Doctors noticed that people who drink coffee regularly often have **better liver enzyme levels** — an important sign that the liver is working well.

# ☕ Coffee and Liver Cancer

One of the most amazing findings: people who drink coffee have a **35–40% lower risk** of getting liver cancer. The protective effect seems stronger in those who drink coffee every day, especially **3 or more cups**.

# ☕ Coffee and Longevity

In some large studies, people who drank coffee daily were found to live longer, especially those who had **liver-related illnesses**. Their livers seemed to handle toxins, alcohol, and fat better than those who avoided coffee.

# ☕ The Magic Number — How Much Coffee Helps?

You don’t need ten cups a day. Most experts agree that **2–4 cups daily** is enough to show benefits. Some benefit can be seen even with **one cup per day**, but the effect is stronger with consistent intake.

In short:

#  Why Coffee Protects the Liver — Explained Simply

Many people think coffee is only about caffeine, but that’s not true. Coffee is full of **natural plant compounds** — tiny helpers that your liver loves. Let’s see how they work in simple terms.

# 🔹 1. Coffee Fights Inflammation

Your liver sometimes gets inflamed when it has to fight toxins or fat. Coffee helps **calm this inflammation**, so your liver doesn’t get tired or swollen over time.

# 🔹 2. Coffee Reduces Scarring (Fibrosis)

When your liver gets hurt repeatedly, it starts forming scars. This is called **fibrosis**, and later it can turn into cirrhosis.  
Certain compounds in coffee help **slow down the process of scarring**, giving your liver a better chance to heal naturally.

# 🔹 3. Coffee Helps Manage Fat

Coffee can help your liver **control how much fat builds up** inside it. It supports your body in using fat for energy instead of letting it pile up.  
That’s why regular coffee drinkers often have **less fatty liver** even if they enjoy regular meals.

# 🔹 4. Coffee Cleans and Protects

Coffee acts like a **cleaning assistant**. It helps your liver process toxins faster and boosts enzymes that clean your blood.  
It also contains **antioxidants** — these are like bodyguards that protect liver cells from small daily damage caused by stress, pollution, and poor diet.

# 🔹 5. Decaf Works Too!

Here’s something many people don’t know — even **decaffeinated coffee** can help your liver! That means caffeine isn’t the only good part; the **natural plant nutrients** in coffee are doing the real healing.

# 💬 Expert Opinion (in plain English)

Doctors who study the liver often call coffee a **“protective friend.”**

For example, many liver specialists now tell their patients with fatty liver or mild liver damage to **drink coffee every day** (without too much sugar or cream).

They explain that coffee doesn’t just mask symptoms — it **actually helps the liver work better** over time.

A famous liver expert once said:

# 📊 Statistical Snapshot (for your easy understanding)

|Coffee Habit|Possible Liver Benefit|Estimated Risk Reduction|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 cup per day|Mild benefit|\~15–20% lower liver risk|
|2–3 cups daily|Noticeable improvement|\~40–50% lower disease risk|
|4 cups daily|Strong protection|\~60% lower liver death risk|
|0 cups|No extra protection|—|

*(Data summarized from multiple health surveys and research results mentioned in public journals.)*

# 🧠 Simple Thought from gomehedi 

At **gomehedi** we always say — *your coffee can be more than comfort; it can be care*.  
When you sip your morning coffee, imagine it quietly helping your liver, giving it strength to clean your body and keep you healthy from the inside.

# Real-Life Experiences, Tips, Infographic Ideas, and Final Words

Let’s look at some real-life experiences shared by coffee lovers around the world.
