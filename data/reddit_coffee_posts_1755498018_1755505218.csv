1mtg41b,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1mtg41b/from_62_in_the_bank_to_25k_mrr_in_8_months_what/,From $62 in the bank to $25k MRR in 8 months - (what we did and why we're still broke),"**TL;DR:** Me and my co-founder launched our SaaS (which automates SEO backlinks) in January with basically no money. Now we're at $25k monthly revenue but have literally $62 in the bank because we're putting everything back into growth. Wild ride.

**How We Got Here**

So back in January 2025, me and my buddy decided to start this company. Just the two of us, working out of coffee shops, eating way too much ramen. Classic startup life, right?

Fast forward to now and we're pulling in $25k a month and growing like 20% every month. Sounds great, except... we have $62 in our bank account. I'm not even kidding.

We made this probably insane decision early on that every single penny we make goes right back into the business. Marketing, servers, tools, getting more customers - everything. It's honestly terrifying watching your bank account stay empty while your revenue graphs look amazing.

My mom thinks we're idiots. She might be right.

**What's actually working**

Here's the stuff that's keeping us alive:

\- **Our #1 rule**: We never spend more to get a customer than what they pay us first. Sounds obvious but it's literally the only reason we haven't gone broke yet.

\- **Testing like crazy**: We pump out 6 new ads every week and kill anything that costs us more than $150 to get a customer. We do like 40% regular images and 60% videos. Some weeks we hit gold and find an ad that works amazing. Other weeks everything sucks and we're just grateful we kill the bad ones fast.

\- **caring about customers!!**: When you have no money as a safety net, you get really, really good at making people happy. Also really stressed, but mostly good at customer service.

\- s**taying small**: Two people means we can make decisions fast and don't have a huge payroll eating us alive.

The whole ""test everything and kill what doesn't work"" thing is probably what saves us. When you've got $62 in the bank, you can't afford to let a crappy ad keep running hoping it'll magically get better.



**That Time We Messed Up Big Time**

So 1 month ago we had this ""brilliant"" idea. Instead of a free trial, let's charge $1. Just a dollar! We figured it would filter out the tire-kickers and get us better customers.

We were wrong.

What actually happened:

* Real customers thought the $1 thing was sketchy and didn't sign up
* The people who did sign up were worse and a bunch didn't even pay their bills
* Our whole system got messed up
* We didn't grow at all for a week (which is basically forever in startup time)
* Went from having a few thousand in the bank to... $62

We switched it back immediately. Sometimes the ""smart"" move is actually pretty dumb.

This is what happens when you have zero room for mistakes - one bad experiment can really hurt.

# ----

Running a $25k/month business with $62 in the bank is... intense. Some days I wake up wondering if we're completely crazy. Though to be fair, we usually have a few thousand in there, going below $500 is pretty rare. And knowing we have recurring revenue coming in definitely helps with the anxiety.

We're not making any profit yet because we're choosing growth over safety. It's scary but also kind of exciting?

# Questions for you:

* Has anyone else done this ""reinvest literally everything"" thing?
* How often do you test new ads? (Our 6 per week feels low but we're broke and its a pain creating them). Should we use any other channel? We tried email but it doesnt work well
* When did you finally start actually paying yourselves real money?

## Key Features Analysis

The Ceramic Dining Table boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall performance and appeal.

**Scratch Resistance:** Ceramic surfaces are exceptionally hard and resistant to scratches, making them ideal for households with children or pets. Unlike wood or laminate, ceramic can withstand the daily wear and tear of cutlery, dishes, and even accidental scrapes without showing noticeable damage.

The Manufacturing process involves firing the ceramic at extremely high temperatures, resulting in a surface that's significantly harder than most common materials used in dining tables. This inherent hardness ensures that the table maintains its pristine appearance for years to come.

**Heat Resistance:** Ceramic is highly heat resistant, allowing you to place hot dishes directly on the table without fear of scorching or discoloration. This eliminates the need for trivets or placemats, simplifying meal service and reducing clutter.

The Composition of ceramic materials, typically including minerals like clay, silica, and feldspar, contributes to its exceptional thermal properties. These materials can withstand temperatures far exceeding those encountered in normal dining scenarios, providing peace of mind and convenience.

**Stain Resistance:** The non-porous surface of ceramic prevents spills and stains from penetrating the material, making it easy to clean and maintain. Whether it's red wine, coffee, or oily sauces, most spills can be simply wiped away with a damp cloth.

Unlike porous materials like wood or stone, ceramic doesn't absorb liquids, preventing stains from setting in. This inherent stain resistance simplifies cleanup and ensures that the table remains looking its best, even after accidental spills.

**UV Resistance:** High-quality ceramic dining tables are treated to resist fading or discoloration from prolonged exposure to sunlight. This makes them suitable for rooms with large windows or outdoor dining areas.

The UV-resistant coating applied to the ceramic surface protects the underlying material from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. This ensures that the table's color and finish remain vibrant and consistent over time, even with extended sun exposure.

**Variety of Designs:** Ceramic dining tables are available in a wide range of styles, from minimalist and modern to rustic and traditional. The ceramic surface can be printed with various patterns, colors, and textures to mimic the look of natural stone, wood, or other materials.

Advanced printing technologies allow manufacturers to create incredibly realistic and detailed designs on the ceramic surface. This versatility enables you to choose a table that perfectly complements your existing décor and reflects your personal style.

## Core Benefits

The Ceramic Dining Table offers several practical benefits that enhance the dining experience and simplify everyday life.

**Improved Durability:** The inherent durability of ceramic ensures that the dining table can withstand the rigors of daily use, resisting scratches, heat, and stains that would damage other materials. Users report significantly longer lifespans compared to wood or laminate tables, which translates to long-term cost savings and reduced replacement frequency.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** The non-porous surface of ceramic makes it resistant to bacteria and mold growth, creating a more hygienic dining environment. Regular cleaning with a damp cloth is typically sufficient to maintain a clean and sanitary surface. This means users can enjoy meals with peace of mind, knowing that their dining table is free from harmful microorganisms.

**Simplified Maintenance:** Cleaning a ceramic dining table is incredibly easy, requiring only a damp cloth and mild detergent for most spills and stains. Unlike wood or stone, ceramic doesn't require special cleaners or sealing treatments. This means users can spend less time cleaning and maintaining their table and more time enjoying meals with family and friends.

**Increased Versatility:** The heat resistance of ceramic allows you to place hot dishes directly on the table without the need for trivets or placemats. This simplifies meal service and reduces clutter, making the dining experience more convenient and enjoyable. This provides considerable freedom and flexibility in how you serve and enjoy meals.

## FAQs Section

**Are ceramic dining tables suitable for outdoor use?**
  Yes, many ceramic dining tables are designed for outdoor use, featuring UV-resistant coatings and durable frames that can withstand the elements. However, it's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the table is specifically rated for outdoor use.

**How do I clean a ceramic dining table?**
  Cleaning a ceramic dining table is typically very easy. Most spills and stains can be removed with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For tougher stains, you can use a non-abrasive cleaner or a solution of baking soda and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers, as these can damage the surface.

**Can ceramic dining tables be repaired if damaged?**
  While ceramic is a durable material, it can be chipped or cracked under extreme impact. Minor chips can sometimes be repaired with a ceramic repair kit, but more significant damage may require professional repair or replacement of the tabletop. It's always best to handle the table with care to prevent damage.

**What is the typical lifespan of a ceramic dining table?**
  With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality ceramic dining table can last for many years, often exceeding the lifespan of tables made from other materials like wood or laminate. The exact lifespan will depend on the quality of the materials and construction, as well as the level of use and care.

# Chap 01 : [**https://writers.blogcraftstudio.com/cheated-1/**](https://writers.blogcraftstudio.com/cheated-1/)

One of the female students in the class had never turned in a single assignment, so Stephanie Brogan deducted her participation grade.

That afternoon, a group of people vandalized her desk.

Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, and her computer screen

was shattered. The thermos water even soaked all the students‘ theses

was

she’d stayed up late correcting.

Stephanie stood there, staring at the mess with shaking fingers.

She drew in a deep breath and got ready to confront Amelia Gibson–until she spotted her husband, Edgar Ferguson, in the corner of the teaching building.

He had Amelia in his arms, gently wiping away her tears. His voice was soft. “Don’t cry. I’ve already stood up for you. No one will dare to bully you while I’m around.”

Amelia sniffled, her eyes red and puffy. “Thank you, Mr. Ferguson. Without you, college would’ve been hell for me. I don’t even know how to repay you.”

Edgar grinned and brushed her lips. “Then give me a kiss as thanks. How about that?”

She looked bashful for a moment, then hesitated before standing on her tiptoes and gently kissing his lips.

“It’s just a thank–you,” she whispered. “But I don’t support this. You have a wife. If you’re going to pursue me, I need time.”

He smoothed her hair softly. “Okay. I’ll wait.”

Chapter 1

Stephanie watched from the shadows, cold blood running through her

veins.

At that moment, she remembered their wedding day. Edgar knelt on one knee on the rose petals, swearing, “Stephanie, I’ll only love you in this life.”

That vow felt empty three years later.

After Amelia went back to the dorm, Stephanie stumbled to the car, her face drained.

Edgar leaned against the front, lighting a cigarette, his face lit by the flame. He looked over, surprised.

“Stephanie?”

“Edgar.” Her voice quivered. “When did this start?”

Edgar froze for a second, then laughed lightly. He took his time letting out a smoke ring. Even through the haze, his eyes still held that dangerous kind of charm.

“Since you’ve discovered it, no point hiding it,” he said lazily. “I only get ten years to fool around. Once I’m old and ugly, there’s no going back.

“I do love you, Stephanie, but don’t expect me to only love you forever. I’ll eventually get bored.

“Amelia reminds me of how you used to be–young and pure. I’m into that right now. Relax. I’m not divorcing you. After I’ve had my fun, I’ll come

back.‘

Stephanie felt like her heart had been grabbed out of her chest and squeezed repeatedly. “I can’t accept it! If you end things with her now, I can still forgive you.”

Edgar frowned, clearly annoyed. “Enough. I’ve already made it clear.

He grabbed her chin, his gaze turning cold. “Behave. Don’t mess with my little lover.”

Then, he let go and left.

Stephanie stood there, her whole body trembling in shock.

She had heard how some rich families worked–where men kept their wives but still messed around with other women. Wealthy heirs like Edgar were dream husbands for a lot of rich girls.

But she never imagined he’d turn out like them.

Because once upon a time, he truly loved her.

He’d gone against his entire family to marry her, a teacher’s daughter. He even stood outside her dorm for three days just to get her back. He knew her coffee preferences, the exact date she got cramps every month, and how much she hated rainy days.

On their wedding day, he held her hand and solemnly promised in front of everyone that she was the only one he’d ever love.

She just didn’t expect that promise to break so fast.

Stephanie had no clue how she even made it back home.

She collapsed on the bed in a daze, soaking her pillow with tears.

When she came to, freezing water had already reached her chest.

Her eyes shot open. She was trapped inside a huge glass tank, her wrists chained above her. Water was slowly rising around her.

Across from her, Edgar was lounging on a leather couch in a crisp suit. With legs crossed, he flipped a lighter open and shut.

The flame lit up the sharp edges of his face, but not the coldness in his

“Edgar!” Stephanie thrashed, splashing water everywhere. “What are you doing?!”

He said coldly, “You went to Amelia and told her to stay away from me.

He shut the lighter with a snap and stood up, walking toward the tank. “She blocked me after that. So now, you’re getting punished.”

Stephanie shook her head wildly, her voice cracking. “No! I didn’t even see her after I got home!”

“Still lying?” Edgar said with a cold smirk, signaling the bodyguard. “Raise the water.”

The tank started filling up faster, and the freezing water climbed like icy fingers around her throat.

Stephanie had to lift her chin to breathe. The terror of drowning filled her every breath.

Edgar showed no concern for her pain. He just stared coldly as she struggled. “I told you I love you already. Just give me ten years. I’ll come

back.

“But until then, don’t ever hurt Amelia.”

With that, he turned and walked off.

“Edgar! Edgar-”

Her screams faded under the rising water. He never looked back.

As I'm sure many others feel, creating a story that barely—or not at all—fits in those common themes comes with an uphill battle many don't find themselves ready for. Some of us may tell ourselves we are fully prepared for that struggle, only to find ourselves becoming disheartened when we see other authors receive exponential growth in comparison to our own stories.

What I want to know, from the successful authors who managed to break through that mold, or from the knowledgeable reader who knows more than most, is what can be done to help get around that? Is it as simple as maintaining consistency, while also ensuring we have that mental resilience to get through? Is it just luck of the draw? Is there a secret method outside of creating multiple ads, shout swapping every chapter, and recommending your story to every adult, teen, and baby?

I would love to hear from those more smarterer than I, as I do feel like my OCD of constantly checking the author dashboard may be leading to unexpected hair loss and a crippling addiction to coffee.

Hello again, my friends in the Great Work!  
  
I’ve been doing Liber Resh vel Helios (lite edition) for a few weeks now. Finally got the adorations memorized (took me long enough). Feeling bold, I thought, “Alright, time to step it up.” So this morning I added the A∴A∴ grade sign (as described by Dr. David Shoemaker in 'Living Thelema') and even started trying to visualize the god-form of RA. 

Except my “mighty solar deity” came out looking less like Lord of the Sun and more like a confused chicken in a headdress. But hey, progress is progress, right?

Then I find out... oh no, that’s just the tutorial level. 

Apparently now I’m supposed to recite over half of AL III:37 after the fact.

Oh, and don’t forget to bellow “AUM!” halfway through, or the universe won’t take you seriously.

And THEN… as a grand finale, I have to visualize myself as Ankh-af-na-khonsu, Nuit’s infinite cosmic body, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit blazing before me. 

All this... before coffee. 

…and then… AND THEN… there are three more god-forms, three more grade signs, *and* I’m supposed to recite that whole chunk of *Liber AL* on top of it all after each one of those adorations! 

Like… Crowley, my guy. What are we doing here? I thought I was supposed to lose my mind while trying to map the Tree of Life, not during my sun salutations!

But hey… I’ll just keep fumbling my way through it until it finally clicks.

Since then I've been single for all of this year, instead focusing on improving my mental and physical health so I can be better than ever before.

Recently I went on a few dates with a girl and they went okay but I broke it off deciding it wouldn't work best as a long term thing. 

Now today I've walked past my ex (she was a lot further away but I recognised her and we saw eachother). And all of a sudden I feel...Off. 

While being single didn't bother me much before, it all of a sudden bugs me now. Now I'm very worried that all this effort I've put into improving has been...Wasted? Like, whats the point in bettering myself if I'm just gonna feel awful when I see my ex? 

And not only that but getting into dating itself is tough as hell! Like, my ex approached me and so I knew she must've liked me so I was fine to reciprocate those feelings. But what about in public? 

Like, I go out to singles nights, I've tried dating apps but they're not really for me. And I always think, well some people meet at coffee shops, the gym and places like that. But to me that seems so risky! Like, what if they're dating someone, what if they're asexual or maybe gay, or if they're just not interested. Then that makes me some guy who just disturbed and made them feel uncomfortable for no reason at all. ;-;

1mtfr6b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtfr6b,Challenging floor plan for small studio with a 10 by 10 living/sleeping space. Please help.,"

Please help.  I would very much appreciate ideas for furnishing a small studio (335 square feet) for a family member. The space needs to be simple, livable, and easily maintained. 

The room needs sleeping options and a place for a television that will be used for streaming and gaming. Ideally, the furniture would be multipurpose. A multipurpose coffee table, dining, and card/board-gaming table would be awesome. [How to Build a 2-in-1 Coffee/Dining Table](https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/coffee-dining-table/)

Furniture placement is limited by a fixed wardrobe, sliding glass doors, and a large air conditioner. 

I like the idea of a Murphy/wall bed but I’m not yet sure if they are allowed. I’ve also considered daybeds. Ikea’s Hemnes looks great in theory (versatile) but the reviews are mixed. A futon frame that easily converts to a bed and couch is also an option. For safety reasons, no loft beds. 

Brands and specific item names would be very helpful. 

No matter what, the bed must be comfortable for daily use. 

My family member is interested in a sofa bed but is unlikely to remove cushions, pull out the bed, and then fold up the bed and replace the cushions on a daily basis. 

What size bed? What’s the optimal furniture placement? And then what’s the optimal placement for a TV?  What size TV would be recommended for the space? 

I love reddit. I don't use it enough to fully understand reddit's rules of etiquette. Please know that I will do my best. So thank you in advance for your patience.

Perfectly balanced, the citrus keeps the cocoa from becoming heavy, resulting in a fragrance that is indulgent yet never cloying. It recalls the taste of soft candied orangettes, with an elegant twist.

The scent evolves beautifully: at first, the orange brightens and envelops the chocolate, then gradually fades to let the cocoa take center stage, becoming creamier and more gourmand over time. Warm and comforting, it feels like the perfect fragrance for autumn and winter evenings - imagine yourself by the fireplace, wrapped in a blanket, watching your favorite Netflix series.

Now, the time has come for Part 3.

\---------------------------------------------

I began the morning the same way I ended the night—rigid on the cot, rifle balanced across my lap like a lifeline. Sleep had been a cruel trick: shallow dips into darkness where I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or simply lying there, paralyzed, eyes shut against the press of the night. My uncle’s warning gnawed at me with every tick of the clock: *The rules aren’t foolproof.*

When I finally forced myself upright, my body locked in place.

A perfect ring of mushrooms circled my cot.

They hadn’t been there last night. Now, pale caps the color of old teeth sprouted thick from the varnished boards, as if the tower itself had begun to rot from within. The stalks curved toward me, thin and quivering, crowding in close—too close.

Beyond the circle, the room looked hazy, distorted, as though I were staring at it through warped glass. My desk, the lantern, the door—still there, but somehow far away, unreachable.

Inside the ring, the air was damp, heavy with the sour stink of wet earth. My breath came shallow, my pulse hammering against the rifle stock.

The tower was supposed to be safe. This was my line. My ground.

But the forest had found a way inside. The salt jars had failed somehow. 

I quickly looked around, trying to find something I could use to break the circle. My gloves and the salt pouch were in my pack, halfway across the room. My eyes looked to the rifle which had saved me on several occasions now, but I knew the weapon would be useless in this instant. I couldn't very well start blowing holes into the watch tower, who knew what else I might let in. 

I started checking my pants pockets, having fallen asleep fully dressed, and that's when pulled out the spare silver coin I always carried.

It glinted in the morning light and for the first time I truly looked at the faces on it. One side was blank as I had noted before, but on the other side was that weird eye-inside-a-diamond symbol I had seen stamped on my employment contract back at the ranger station. And just like back at the ranger station, just seeing the symbol calmed me a bit.

I set the coin down. As it thumped onto the ground, I heard something resonate and echo a little within my small circle. Using the tip of the rifle barrel, I pushed the coin towards a section of the mushroom circle. As soon as its glinting edged touched one of the mushrooms, the hazy barrier around me collapsed and all the mushrooms immediately shriveled and curled into blacken husks.

I breathed a sigh of relief, finally getting a good look around the room as I stepped off the bed. As I suspected all the salt jars were completely drained of salt. I was completely unprotected. I loudly chastised myself on my carelessness, I hadn't salted any of the openings or even around my bed. I must have swore for a full two minutes to myself for being an absolutely dumbass.

Still, it must have taken whatever was in the forest a considerable amount of strength to deplete all the jars. I quickly refilled them all and went through the motions. It was 6:28am, my entire ordeal had lasted only a few minutes. I check the corners. Rifle at the ready. Nothing else out of place, the tower seemed to be clear of strange objects.

I decided to start with the sat phone. Uncle Ray’s corrections or not, the rules were rules—and Rule 9 was gnawing at me after yesterday’s encounter with the \*not-really-a-girl\* in the red raincoat. I wasn't able to call in the events from yesterday after I got back because I was too keyed up and still trying to sort myself out.

It was weird how I could walk away from two deployments overseas, with 21 confirmed kills, watched four of my closest friends die, and come back with just mild PTSD, *at least that's what the therapist said.* But, a couple days in the these strange woods had me completely shaken to my very core and breaking out in full sweats in the middle of fall. *Like seriously, what the hell is wrong with this place!?*

After a couple minutes just gazing at nothing, I pulled the satellite phone from its shelf, dialed the number, waited through the long mechanical clicks. My throat was tight when I spoke.

“I know Six has seen Eight Thirteen and Two are there.”

I waited for the mechanical confirmation, then gave a report on what I did and saw yesterday and little bit of what happened this morning. It took me a full fifteen minutes, just getting it all out there. I think I even shot in a few cuss words in there for good measure.

I didn't hear a single reply to my ramblings, no even an ""Mhmm"" or ""Continue"", I mind as well be giving a report to myself.

After I was done, I waiting a couple beats. Nothing. I thought I heard someone faintly typing in the ensuing silence, but it could have been just in my head. Then:

“Acknowledged. Remain in the watch tower until tomorrow's patrol. Continue Watch.”

Then the line went dead. Well, that was new.

They were going to give me nothing to go on here except *stay where you are while we fix this mess.* I was just a point of contact to them. It was *Working-for-the-Government-101* all over again.

I set the sat phone back on the shelf, listening to the faint click as it settled into place. The words kept circling in my head: *Remain in the watch tower until tomorrow's patrol.*

That wasn’t the usual phrasing. The rules said to keep to the routine—patrols every morning, salt jars checked, coins replaced. But now they wanted me *inside*? Why?

After I had salted and swept the mushroom husks from the room, I paced the length of the tower twice, rifle still in hand. Every part of me itched to ignore the order and head down anyway. The thought of leaving the totems uninspected, after a few days of doing the opposite, made my stomach turn. But then again, ignoring rules—or orders—was how people ended up disappearing out here.

I tried to keep busy. I brewed myself some coffee. Got around to making some brunch, since it was too late for breakfast. I checked the salt jars one by one again. All four were fine.

The hours crawled. The tower was too quiet. I checked the solar cells and batteries. I cleaned the rifle as best I could, and I did some actual fire watching again. The forest beyond the glass looked calm, almost scenic, but every time I let my eyes linger, I had the same uneasy impression: the trees weren’t just standing. They were *waiting.*

As the clock struck noon, I heard something on the wind. It was faint, distant, but I would never mistake that noise for anything else; a helicopter. The sound was coming from the west, and after squinting for a few minutes I finally gave in and pulled out the binoculars.

There were two helicopters. One had the distinctive sleek profile of a UH-60 Black Hawk, painted in dark forest greens with no evident markings. The other one was *big*... a CH-47 Chinook; its easily identifiable twin large rotors whirling so strongly, its downwash was almost bending nearby trees. It too was painted in the same dark greens as the smaller Black Hawk and also did not have any evident markings.

They seemed to be hovering around a clearing, the Black Hawk's two door gunners clearly pointing their weapons down into a shadowed area. I had a feeling that if I crossed-referenced their approximate location with my maps, it would match up with the exact site of the damaged totem.

I let out a deep breath. For the first time in days, I had the re-assuring feeling that I wasn't truly alone out here. That what I did actually mattered. The Rangers--the Government or whatever this organization was, had brought in actual military-grade hardware to take care of an issue I discovered out here.

But, the feeling was fleeting, because as soon as I had the thought, I also realized that if the government too this seriously enough to divert these assets all the out here in the middle of nowhere Appalachia, then the whole thing was a truly big-\*fucking-\*deal and my anxiety spiked up a notch.

After watching them for a good half-hour, I went back inside, pacing the length of the cabin just to burn off nervous energy. I wanted to call them, hail them somehow, but I knew better. Rule 9 was clear—sat phone only, no improvising. No signals, no flares. Nothing that might draw the wrong kind of attention.

Still, I couldn’t shake the image of the Chinook hanging low over the trees, rotors churning the forest into chaos, the Black Hawk's gunners fixed on something hidden in the shadows below. What the hell had they seen down there? What was big enough, or dangerous enough, to justify *that* level of firepower?

By mid-afternoon, the noise of the helicopters began to fade. Every so often I had take my binoculars and checked the forest, ostensibly to do some more fire watching, but mostly to see if the helicopters were still there. At around 3pm, I just caught them leaving the area, breaking for the south at top speed.

*Well, that's it. I'm alone again.*

It was quiet again. Normal quiet. Birds flickered through the treetops. Squirrels chattered. If not for what I’d seen through the glass, I could have almost convinced myself I imagined the whole thing.

Almost.

The rest of the day stretched thin. I tried to read, there were some novels on the shelf, probably books my uncle had read hundreds of times. But I couldn’t keep my mind on the pages. I ended up cleaning the room twice, rechecking and then rearranging my limited food stores, and taking notes on my uncle’s rules just to keep busy.

As the light dimmed and the treetops bled into silhouette, I felt the old unease creep back in. The helicopters were gone, but the waiting trees were still out there. Always waiting.

At 5:30 I cracked, grabbed the binoculars, and swept the treeline one last time. North—clear. East—clear. South—fog spilling over the ridge like something alive, but still. Then west.

There.

A shape.

Not close—maybe a hundred yards down the slope—but tall, upright, sharp against the tangle of brush. Too tall for a deer. Too straight for anything natural.

I went rigid, the binoculars digging into my face. The figure didn’t move. It just stood there—watching, waiting. I told myself it could be a tree, a trick of branches and shadow. But west was where the totems stood, and in my gut I already knew the truth.

I dropped the glasses, blinked hard, and snapped them back up.

Gone.

*Because of course it was.* Just like every horror story I used to laugh at.

A hot pulse of anger cut through the fear. I locked the lenses on that patch of forest for five full minutes, breath shallow, heartbeat slamming in my ears. Nothing. When I finally lowered the binoculars, my hands shook so hard I nearly fumbled them—rage, terror, I couldn’t tell which.

*Stay in the tower. Continue Watch.*

Right.

I bolted the door the moment I stepped inside. That was when I saw them.

The dolls.

Two of them this time, carved from wood, sitting back-to-back on the desk.

My stomach dropped, then fury surged up again with a vengeance and swallowed the fear whole. I yanked on the gloves, grabbed both dolls, and marched them outside. With deliberate calm I set them side by side on the flat balcony railing.

Then I grabbed my uncle's rifle, chambered a round, and let the rage burn through my trigger finger. The crack split the air. Both dolls exploded into splinters, shards scattering into the dusk.

For the briefest heartbeat—just at the edge of the report—I thought I heard an inhuman shriek of pain, agonized and reverberating across the gloom. 

I narrowed my eyes and I smirked.

The sun bled out of the sky fast, dragging the forest from gold into gray. By the time I switched on the room lights, the air itself felt coiled, charged. My skin prickled the way it used to before a night OP overseas, when you *knew* something was out there and were just waiting for it to break cover.

By that time, my rage had bled away, and like back when I was overseas, I knew sleep wasn’t coming easy. This time, I spread salt everywhere I could think of, aware that my on-hand supply was dwindling. Saturday's resupply couldn't come soon enough.



\---------------------------------------------

The morning of my fifth day didn’t arrive so much as it leaked through the cracks. Night hadn’t ended—just thinned. My head swam in the fog of half-sleep, haunted by images that weren’t dreams: the lantern flaring brighter on its own, shadows pacing across the glass, the prickling certainty that if I turned too quickly, I’d see a face pressed against the window. At some point, sheer exhaustion must’ve dragged me under. The dawning light over the treetops was the only proof I’d made it through.

The rifle was still on my bed, chambered. My hand hovered there too long before I carried it back to  its rack. Routine. Always routine.

Salt jars first.

Three corners were untouched. The fourth—was now more than half empty and somehow wet on the inside. Not just clumped, but slick, dripping like it had been dredged from a flooded basement. Beads of water slid down the inside of the glass, though the tower air was arid as bone.

I dumped it onto the balcony. The mass hit with a wet slap, sliding apart like spoiled meat. I washed the jar on the sink and wiped it down with a clean cloth. Then, I refilled the salt from the diminishing contents of the pouch.

I washed up quickly and changed into fresher clothes. Then I redonned my heavy jacket and pack. Pulled the rifle from its rack, drawing comfort from its weight. I chambered a round and unbolted the door.

The stairwell moaned beneath me as I tested the first steps down. My chest locked tight. Count them. Count or else. One. Two. Three… by the time I reached the second landing, sweat was running down my spine. My heart nearly stopped when I stepped onto the dirt after having only counted 42 steps.

*Damn.*

I pulled out the old paper and immediately checked **Rule 3:**

**Each time you climb the stairway to the top of the tower, you must count out loud the number of steps. There must be 45 steps and three landings, with the final one having the door to the lookout. If the number is different when you reach the top, sprinkle salt on the last landing and touch a silver coin to the door handle before opening the door to the lookout.**

That was it? But I was leaving the tower, not climbing it. Stood there, utterly confused on what to do next. *Did they expect me to improv this?*

The air outside was crisp, pine-sweet, but it couldn’t mask the suffocating weight that seemed to be press down on me as I came off the last step. I had a feeling that after my little display of defiance last night, the forest was stepping up its game. 

The woods felt closer. Listening.

I took another look back at the rules, then checked everything I had on me. *Fine then. Let's play it by ear.* 

The first thing that told me I was on the right track was when I pulled out the as-yet unused pouch of iron nails, the pressure seemed to redouble its efforts, forcing me to grit my teeth and take big deep breaths.

I placed one nail on the last step of the stairway and took a step back. Then I scattered some salt over the area and began to chant:

**""I am the ranger, land and air.** 

**I am the ranger, river and bear.** 

**I am the ranger, away with you.** 

**I am the ranger, until I'm through.""**

With every word the pressure seemed to fluctuate. Strengthening and weakening. I chanted it again. The pressure seemed to be easing. By the fifth chant, I could finally breathe without effort. It seemed to have worked. I glanced around me, nothing was close. No figure in the shadows, no little girls.

With that improv session done, I turned and began my patrol, packed re-slung and rifle at the low ready.             

The first and second totems were unchanged, coins glinting faintly in their nests of dirt.

The third was bare. Coin gone. My heart jackhammered.

I quickly placed another, salted the soil, crouched with the rifle up. The trees swayed without wind. No sound. Nothing moved. Just waiting.

At the fourth, my stomach twisted. *What. The. Hell?*  
  
The salt circle was scattered completely. A coin was there, yes, but not a silver. Copper. Warped and blistered like it had been dragged from fire. My glove burned cold against it. I swapped it for one of Ray’s silvers, and tossed the copper one as far as I could throw it. I did a which circuit around the totem, glancing at the shadows towards the trees.

A couple times, I thought I saw a slim figure watching me, but it had quickly stepped back into the greenery as soon as I spotted it. I frowned in suspicion, but couldn't determine anything I could do about it without stepping away from the patrol path--which I absolutely was not going to do.

And then I reached the fifth.

I froze.

The damaged totem was gone. 

In its place stood a new one—taller, straighter, less gnarled, less notched; its wood pale and fresh, the sap still seeping from its grain. The carvings weren’t weather-worn like the others. They were sharper, deeper, more elaborate. Spirals and jagged marks gouged into the log, curling like veins. The symbols seemed to shift if I stared too long, edges crawling under the morning light.

*Did the Government just have a few of these things lying around ready to replace damaged or destroyed ones? Then again, they have been at it for a few generations, so anything was possible...*

Beside it, a ring of ash stained the earth. The remains of a bonfire. Charred wood lay scattered. Something brittle and white jutted out of the soot. I stepped closer and bent to examine them—bones. Small ones. Some type of bird, maybe. Chicken bones? Maybe not. Blackened, fragile, broken.

Around it, there were the imprint of heavy boots on the soil, probably from the task force that was sent here yesterday. What really sent a chill down my spine was the discovery of several shotgun shell casings on the ground. There had been a short battle here, something in the forest had clearly objected to their replacing of the totem. 

At its base, a ring of ash marked a firepit. The soil was blackened, bone fragments scattered through it. Too small to be deer. Too long to be bird. Burnt hollow. Wrong.

Bootprints trampled the earth all around—broad, heavy treads, fresh. The task force. The ones sent yesterday.

Shotgun shells and rifle casings littered the ground, the tarnished brass dull beneath the ash. Some were dented, half-buried in the soil, others scuffed as if kicked aside in a struggle. Not just a few—dozens. Fired, and often. A skirmish, close and vicious.

The air here was different. Heavier. It carried a static charge that made my molars ache, a low buzzing in my skull like standing beneath a powerline. Every breath I drew left a metallic tang on my tongue, sharp and bitter, like copper pennies or blood.

The woods weren’t just watching anymore. I could *feel* them leaning in, the tree line drawn close and dense, as though the forest had shifted in the night to choke the clearing tighter. The silence was oppressive, weighted, as if the world itself were holding its breath. Angry. Expectant.

For four days, they had tested me—phantoms on the periphery, coins gone missing, whispers fingering at the glass, shapes in the timberline that vanished when named. All games meant to chip away at me, to push me off balance. But standing here before this new totem, the truth clawed at my chest until I could no longer ignore it.

Whatever they tried, wasn’t working.

They couldn’t drive me off with fear. And they couldn’t simply kill me outright—something in the rules held them back, bound them to terms older than I could understand. They also didn't expect that I could hurt them back, regardless of their experiences with my uncle.

So now they were shifting the terms. Growing desperate. I realized that because I was new to all this, they had a limited window of time to play me into making a bigger mistake than I already have.

The symbols carved into the fresh totem were flowing lines. Smooth and gentle curves that led into spirals and arcs, their grooves catching the light like water rippling across stone. It evoked family and bonding. Journeying and coming home. The wood itself seemed warm, alive in a way that felt somewhat comforting, a strong feeling than I had at the other totems. The grain shimmered faintly, as though the log breathed slow and steady—not menacing, but reassuring, as if it were trying to soothe me, to ground me in this reality.

I looked back at the ground, it still reeked of ash. The bones in the fire pit were brittle and charred, but not all of them were animal—I knew that even before I looked too close. Beside the pit, soldiers’ footprints stamped the soil deep, leading into the tree line. None led back out.

Something had stood here last night. Something that burned bones to ash, warped coins into slag, and left its battlefield marked with silence and shells.

I turned back to the path, resolved to continue my patrol back to the watch tower. Whatever it was that was in these forests, it felt like it wasn’t comfortable playing small games anymore.

The woods wanted me gone, wanted to totems destroyed.

And it was done being patient.

The rest of the patrol was quiet—too quiet. The woods had that hollow stillness again, the kind that swallowed my footsteps and left me straining for sounds that never came. I remembered **Rule 10:**  
  
**If the birds or surrounding ambient noise go suddenly quiet, quickly take note of the area you are in and make your way directly back to watch tower. Do not run, and do not deviate from your path. Once inside, use the Satellite phone, starting the code phrase in Rule 8, and report on where the lull in sound occurred.**

I trudged on, facing forward with each step. By the time I reached the tower, sound had returned and it was just passed 2pm, the sun was now lower in the sky, but not by much. I expected the nail and the salt I had left on the first step earlier to be gone, but they remained. Slowly, I climbed the stairway, counting out load. Three landings, 45 steps. It appeared that everything had returned to normal.

*Yea, right.*

Inside, I checked the jars. Three were down to half their contents. The fourth—was slick again. A damp sheen clung to the salt like sweat on skin, droplets quivering as if the jar itself were breathing. Again, I dumped the contents of the fourth outside and washed it clean. I refilled the other jars and replaced them all at their corners. 

By the time night bled across the windows, the air in the tower had curdled. I turned on the lights of the tower, but the brightness of the lamps seemed to be dimmer. The walls seemed stretched thin, fragile, as if something outside were pressing its face against them, waiting for the right moment to break through. Every groan of the floorboards, every whisper of wind through the slats, rattled in my bones like a warning too late.

And then it hit me—I was being watched. It was the familiar sense of eyes from the treeline, but more intense, as if whatever was watching me absolutely hated by very existence.

I turned toward the window. The glass gave me back my reflection—the cot, the rifle, the dead overhead bulb, the unlit lantern in the corner. Then, the surface rippled as though stirred from beneath. My features drained away: cheeks hollowed, skin drawn tight over bone, eyes ringed with ash. My uncle stared back at me through my own face, lips parting, whispering words I couldn’t hear—though I *felt* them, brushing hot against the inside of my skull.

I lurched back, striking the cot hard enough to rattle its frame. The image was gone. Only me. Just me.

The tower groaned around me, a long, warping creak like ribs bending under pressure. Then came the sound. Deep. Primeval. A growl too large for the world, vibrating through the walls, through the floor, through my teeth. It wasn’t just outside—it was inside, wrapped around me, pushing into every seam of the tower until I couldn’t tell if the walls held it out or kept it in.

My hands moved without thought. I went to each door, re-checking every bolt twice over. I checked the solar batteries—98%. It would last all night. But that felt meaningless against the sound. I grabbed a granola bar from the food stores and bit into it know I was going to need my strength.

Dragging the metal chair to roughly the center of the room, I poured the last of my salt in a rough circle around me, mixing in iron nails until the ring bristled with jagged teeth. Then I sat inside, rifle gripped tight, the weight of it anchoring me against the pressure of the dark.

The glass windows loomed on every side. I forced myself to watch them all, waiting. Listening. There was a second growl which faded into silence, but the silence was worse.

Because silence meant it was *close enough not to need a voice anymore.*

Then, I felt it. A colossal jolt to the very foundations of the metal tower. Something had hit my home with enough force to jar the entire structure. Something big and angry.

Again and again, the impacts came. Objects fell off the table and shelves. Other things got loose. I remained seated, leaning forward to help keep my balance, an island of steady resolve. I thought for sure a few of the windows were going to shatter.

The impacts must have lasted almost thirty, may be forty seconds, before they finally ceased. 

When it was over, the tower still stood, the room was intact. I was exhausted. But I stayed seated and alert for four more hours after that, finally deciding it was safe to stand down at 2am. 

I slept with the rifle and ammo within ease reach, the pouch of nails dangling from one of the bed posts, and there was a silver coin in both my pockets. I wasn't taking any chances.

I took a slow breath. It had been one hell of a Friday night.

1mtfpih,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1mtfpih/is_it_bare_minimum_or_not/,Is it bare minimum or not??.,"I recently went on a trip with my friends. It was an all-boys trip with only two girls. It was arranged by my friend’s boyfriend and his friends. I am really jealous, amazed, and kind of confused because I have never seen such things in a relationship.So, it was a car trip. I sat in the front seat with one guy, and my friend and her boyfriend sat in the back seat. My friend has motion sickness, so her health was not good. She was feeling nauseous the entire time. We stopped at one place to visit, and then my friend’s boyfriend went to a shop to get sugar. But then he made nimbu pani for my friend in the middle of the road. I was like, “Is he really that sweet, or just pretending?”Then we went to our next stop. During the entire journey, my friend was sleeping on his shoulder or in his lap. Whenever she hinted that she wanted to sleep, he would put a small towel on his shoulder so that she would not feel her shoulder blades and could sleep peacefully. For two nights, we were traveling, and my friend was always sleeping peacefully in the back seat on her boyfriend’s lap. And he always sat like he hadn’t slept at all so that she could sleep peacefully. Once, we were roaming in a fair, and my friend’s shoelaces were untied. She told her boyfriend, and he tied them for her I was really confused—does this mean he is genuinely caring, or is he just pretending? Sorry, but I have never met any guy who is this caring. Most of my guy friends are idiots, that’s why they are just my friends.My friend only drinks coffee and never drinks street chai. So he and his friend specially found a stall that sells coffee. Then he started cooling down the coffee with his mouth so that my friend could drink it. She was sitting in the car, waiting for her coffee.She was the only girl on the trip, and I also spent most of my time with her. When she was getting ready, I saw her boyfriend cleaning the room, folding all her clothes, and arranging things. He was even arranging her jewelry for her outfit—obviously asking her what she wanted.I am sorry if I sound like a jealous friend, but I want to know—is this the bare minimum, or is it really that caring?

1mtforo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuddenValley/comments/1mtforo/unofficial_summary_of_longrange_planning/,Unofficial Summary of Long-Range Planning Committee Meeting 8/13/25,"**Recap Discussion About Barn 6 Town Hall -** 

Barn 6 presentation itself went well, feedback was solicited and responded to, and the community seemed responsive.

\[Note from me - I was there, the response was not all positive and that idea that ""everybody bought into the whole program"" is a stretch.\]

\[Additional note from me - one member of LRPC talked about how receptive the committee was to feedback, and said that ""we all might not agree, but we will listen and respect"". I beg to differ. During the member comment period, one resident was giving a well-thought-out and calm comment but was interrupted twice by this committee member shouting out from the audience. That committee member then went to the podium to make his argument, and on the way back to his seat, he walked past the resident and told her to ""Eat shit."" Let's not be fooled here, folks, because this is a historic and clear pattern by this person.\]

A resident (Jeff Mildner) spoke at the committee meeting as a guest, to present an alternate vision for the barn situation, including tearing down Barn 8 and rebuilding to purpose on that site, rather than constructing a new building on the Barn 6 site and then renovating Barn 8. Since some kind of building will have to remain on the Barn 8 footprint to house the locker rooms, etc for the pool, the resident felt that his idea would make more sense than having two buildings to build/renovate, maintain and operate. He said that then the Barn 6 site could be utilized to hold temporary portable spaces for meetings, etc while a new and simplified Barn 8 is being built, without a basketball court. Then at a much lower cost, an open pavilion could be built on the Barn 6 site once the temporary structures were removed. The savings could easily be several million dollars for the entire project.

The committee discussed revising the current proposal in light of this new possible scenario.

\[Note from me - Thank you to Mr. Mildner for coming forward with this idea. And I give the committee members credit for being willing to step away from the original Barn 6 proposal and consider this alternative. It can be hard to spend this much time on a proposal and then possibly have it tossed out.\]

**Parking Pass Sticker Update** \- so far, 731 stickers have been given out by SVCA. 

\[Note from me - there seems to be quite a bit of confusion on this program. Board President McLean clearly stated at recent BOD meeting that the stickers were NOT mandatory. But Direction Meador said at this meeting that they WERE mandatory. In the recent Views article, the front page says that the stickers MAY become mandatory, but the article continuation on Page 10 says ""Beginning Aug 1, all vehicles parked at SV amenities"" will need a sticker, which sounds ""mandatory' to me. And it's important to know that before the stickers can be made mandatory, the board would be required to vote in a new policy as well as appropriate additions to our Rules and Regulations - including establishment of consequences for noncompliance. The LRPC does not have the authority to take any such action itself.\]

**Coffee Shop** \- lease negotiations are still in progress.

**Assisted Living Facility lease for Area Y** \- preliminary discussions with developers are still underway. Current prospect is not interested unless SVCA takes a large stake in the facility.

\[Note from me - okay, this is nuts, along with a similar plan for condos. The membership passed a Bylaws amendment so that this 15-acre wooded property could not be sold BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE DEVELOPED. The LRPC is going around this by trying to find a developer to lease and develop the property instead. Additionally, this property is zoned as R5A, which means one residential dwelling unit per 5 acres, or a cluster of 3 dwelling units closer together on a 15 acre parcel. A retirement facility is a conditional use that would likely not be approved by the county anyway especially in the watershed.\]

**Solar Panel Array on Airfield** \- a letter was sent by the General Manager to PSE regarding leasing a portion of the airfield to them for placement of a solar array there. One committee member then suggested that if PSE turns the proposal down, we should consider building self-storage units at the airfield.

\[Note from me - I have not seen any details on what this solar panel array would entail, nor exactly where. It would almost certainly involve removing a good amount of trees. I ran into someone at the airfield the other day who said he was told by someone in the Welcome Center that it would be between Older Lane and the WWU property and that it would also likely have trailer parking under it. Why in the world would someone in Admin be giving out that information??? And once again, this property is zoned as residential and it would require a conditional use permit for this purpose - doubtful that the County would allow it, nor a self-storage facility.\]

**Ideas to generate future revenue -** 

Sell the campground property to City of Bellingham

Contact the County to discuss how they could provide some type of additional services to SVCA in return for the millions we pay to the county, including a large chunk to ""roads"". This could lower SVCA costs for maintenance.

**Other concerns -** 

Loss of land on the north side of the road when entering the marina from Marina Dr. Should SVCA be planning to mitigate this in the future?

A committee member suggested that SVCA needs a yearly calendar of what repairs are needed, in order to do proper planning. It was explained that SVCA has a reserve study that goes out for decades into the future for this purpose. Member wondered if the barns were on there, and the answer was yes.

\[Note from me - this is a very serious issue. We cannot have members on a Long Range Planning Committee who are not even aware that there is a Reserve Study that should be referenced for all long range planning involving current assets. Big failure here by whoever was responsible for properly briefing all LRPC members at the start of their terms.\]

**Scheduling an additional meeting to focus on potential revisions to the Barn plans -** 

Meeting was scheduled for Weds, Aug 20 at 6:30pm. Tech support indicated he would be out of town and unable to record. Suggestion was made by a committee member to call it a subcommittee meeting so that recording would not be required, and that was agreed to by the members.

\[Note from me - tech support rescheduled his vacation and will be available to record. And although it's now a moot point, it is unacceptable for the committee to simply call it a ""subcommittee meeting"" in order to get around the anticipated lack of recording. This has been a ""committee of the whole"" topic for months and all members of the committee would be attending (unless out of town). The full membership of SVCA has the right to hear the discussion and decision-making made by LRPC on this very important topic.\]

The evaluation of Gerd and IBS(finally answers)
July 25th 2025 weight:168lbs.
• my aunt makes an appointment with the doctor in mexico at 2pm.. i talk with him over the phone( for privacy reasons i won't say the doctor's name or any info) so he presents himself (btw hes a cardiologist and intestines doctor with several degrees and has been doing this for 35yrs.) So he ask me to start describing my symptoms(knot/bump on my throat, hard to swallow food, dry throat and mouth,burning sensation in my stomach and chest, bloating sensation in my stomach, hard to use the restroom (constipated) full of air after eating, shortness of breath while eating or when done, dizziness and heavy chest congestion( like if someone is squeezing your chest very tight.) I start to tell him everything, he then says this"" what did they prescribed you there"" i told him omeprazole for my stomach he got very angry... he said ""what did they find in the test."" I said nothing. He asked have they done an endoscopy. I said no it would be months before i see that happen.. (i called the office and made and appointment they wouldn't see me till dec 1st.) He then said ok listen everything you just told me if you're being honest with me you have ""Gerd with Irritable bowel syndrome and heavy acid reflux..."" ""omeprazole is not going to do nothing for you because you are way past the early stage and also omeprazole is what they give everyone and it won't work unless they give you the right treatment.."" he then says this ""the chest congestion you feel the tightness could be 2 things"" 1. Acid reflux has caused irritation and inflammation damage to your lung airways.. which is very common and nothing to alarm but its very discomforting and scary for those who don't know what it is because it feels like your dying of suffocation but your not, your airways are irritated and lacking lubrication which causes mucus build up and a dry cough(chronic cough).
Or
2. You have something we call here ""Anginas en el pecho"" (Anginas in your chest) (heart problems) which is unlikely but we can't discard that because those symptoms are similar to the chest tightness and shortness of breath...
He then said ""this is what we are going to do. Ima send you medicines for the IBS and Gerd for 20 days and see how your body responds, if it goes well ill send you the rest of the treatment sound fair."" I said yes dr. He then said ill hear from you in 20 days or so.. also you need to avoid certain things and food to prevent from making it worse, it was a good bit of things avoid: spicy foods, citric foods or drinks, tomatoes(green or red),onions, caffeine, coffee, lactose, greasy foods, takeout/fast food, condiments added to foods(ex. Garlic powder, black pepper, etc.) No high fat meats(pork or beef), no alcohol, no carbonated drinks, no wheat and NO chocolate.

August 6th 2025 weight:168lbs.
•medicine arrives i look at the prescription and its 4 different medicines enough for 20 days, as i read the prescription its a total of 10 capsules per day, yes 10 capsules per day... i start the medicines that day..

•i have received the full treatment from my doctor. I dont feel constipated as much anymore, i can swallow food now, and the congestion is slowly getting better,( he did say the congestion will take time to get better if its from the acid irritation he said about roughly 1 month before i see a bid change in congestion...

I will keep updating on how it goes im going to send him copies of the EKG test they have done on me here and see what he says and hopefully discard the second thing... all i can say is gerd and IBS is no joke, for anyone whos going through this you're not alone, im hispanic(mexican) and we're supposed to eat the spiciest food right, yea thats not true, if you're wondering IBS is genetically passed on not made, gerd on the other hand is not genetically... if you suffer from this dont be scared you just need to find the right doctor, omeprazole is not the answer to this, its a bandaid and not a good one either.. if your doctor says you just need to see a therapist its mental or omeprazole or famotidine will work, trust me it won't.. you need a different doctor.. yes IBS is mental but if they don't give you the right medicine it won't help, ask me how i know...",1,1755503257.0,GERD,0,0.99,False

This has been my experience for the longest time. Whenever I was in public, I felt judged when I wasn’t hanging out with others. In the town I’m currently living in, I used to have a friend group with which I would feel very comfortable going to the cinema. Since circa 1.5 years though, this friend group has been split up which made me stop going to the movies altogether…

But one night, I just thought, “What the hell?” and went to the movies alone. I was a bit uncomfortable in the beginning. Kind of like being on a first date with yourself. But the date went well! I found that the peace of mind set in after some time. I journaled a bit, drank a cup of coffee, and then went in to watch the movie. Funnily enough, I found that it did not really matter for the experience. Nobody was looking at me, giving me side eye. I was actually enjoying myself. I could immerse myself deeply into the movie because I was just there for myself. It was just me and the big screen.

Also, I love my friends, but sometimes I find it distracting to go to the cinema with others, especially when it’s more of an obscure movie I want to watch. I already find it hard enough on my own to figure out how I feel about a movie, and seeing them react to it can be more distracting than immersing from time to time. I have had experiences where I have seen movies with others and then rewatched them alone with an entirely different experience.

So, for about the last year, I have been regularly going to the movies alone. It is a way I treat myself after a long week or if I’ve had a rough day. I always sit there, drinking my coffee, journaling, looking at the people that come in, observing. I would not want it any other way. From time to time, I still go to the movies with other people, but this is more of a bonus when it happens than a requirement. Instead of feeling more alienated by doing so, it has brought me closer to myself. I really enjoy my own company, and now I also go out to eat by myself or sit in a bar by myself. I have started to realize that that’s what it’s all about. Enjoying the peace and quiet of spending time with yourself.

So if you want to go out, but don’t particularly feel like socializing, just do it anyway! People are so invested in their own lives that they don’t even notice you sitting in a park, a café, or a cinema alone. And if they do notice you, they’re probably thinking to themselves, “Wow, I wish I were brave enough to do that!”.

1mtfln3,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1mtfln3/had_my_presentation_today/,Had my presentation today,"It went fine, I guess. Not good but not a disaster. It was only a 5 minute presentation in front of the class, but I have been dreading this for the past week now. I had an experience doing a presentation in high school that pretty much traumatized me from presentations from then on. For some reason, I began stuttering, shaking, and nearly had a panic attack during my presentation. Since then, I've dreaded having to do them.

I'm now in a graduate program in my mid 20's, and being competent at communication is an expectation. Most of my classmates had pretty good presentations, but I definitely had the shortest one. I made sure to keep mine just under 5 minutes so I didn't have to speak that long. I also went last, so most of the class was checked out and not really listening by then. 

Now that I think about, it's a little crazy how medicated I was today. This morning, I had my coffee and I put a bit of rum into it. Not a lot, less than half a shot. I had already been dreading this for several days and the presentation was later in the day. I was so tired of the anxiety and anticipation that I had to take the edge off a bit. Then, an hour before the presentation I took my 40 mg propranolol and 25 mg CBD oil. The CBD oil was to try and calm me down a bit since the propranolol is only physical, but it didn't do much. The propranolol was useful as always though. Without it, presentations would be a disaster for me. I would definitely have all the panic symptoms like red face, stuttering, shaking, etc. Thankfully, 40 mg propranolol is more than enough to limit all of that. The issue is that propranolol only affects the physical aspects of social anxiety, but not the mental which is the biggest issue.

Somebody next to me tried speaking to me before my presentation, but I was so nervous and in my own head that I just kind of ignored him. My mind goes blank when I'm put in an anxious spot like that. None of the medications are helping with what's going on in my head. I'm really hoping to find a long term solution to social anxiety with a psychiatrist because living like this is exhausting.",1,1755503177.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Explore Sydney gardens, coastal walks, coffee shops etc with no earbuds; initiate small talks.
2. Visit haymarket, supermarkets, and thrift shops where locals shop. Be a curious traveller and, like a scientist, keenly observe how things are different there from my home country (India).
3. For my 1 week Canberra and Sydney trip no eSIM/SIM. One week of disconnected, mindful time, completely indulged in sights, smells, sounds, and tastes!
4. Extensive journalling including word painting (describing the scenes and incidents to its finest details!)
5. Travel with One Bag (no check ins) and adopt ultra-lightweight philosophy. No souvenirs except perhaps a fridge magnet. Prioritize experience and comfort (total sub-10 kg backpack, inflatable neck pillow, noise-cancelling headphones, 3D sleep mask etc) rather than things. I love r/OneBag tips, like capsule wardrobe.

So I select blocks of photos, sometimes I get “merge exact copies”. This is great, so having done a manual check to make sure that they do indeed have the same file size location et cetera, I do. This leads lots of photos usually pairs, with the option just “merge“. I still have not dared press this option because it’s not totally clear to me how different the photo has to be to be regarded by the system as “identical“. For example, I have two photos with an identical background and my wife sitting on a chair in the foreground drinking coffee. On one photo she has the coffee near her lap, on the other she has the coffee lifted as if in a salute. The system consider these identical. They are also exactly the same file size and location. Which will it choose? Equally, I have an output photo converted to JPEG using Lightroom without any modifications. The system considers these identical despite the source being raw and around 80 MB, and the output being about 5 MB. Which one it will it chooses? As an aside, I would so love to have the option to globally “merge all exact copies”.

1mtfijp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtfijp,Idea for a Sponsored progression system in Splitgate 2,"What if Splitgate had a sponsor system (in a way, similar to The Finals) but functions like the Splitgate Showdown, where players can compete to win prizes awarded at the end of the Chapter/Season, with everyone receiving their rewards no matter who won? Ripping straight from The Finals, there could be some sort of progression track with different cosmetics for skins and camos that can be progressed whenever, acting like a free mini-battlepass. It would fit with the “sport” aspect of the SSL and could maybe be an interesting way for players to obtain free cosmetics outside of mastery grinding. Obviously it would be wrong to have exactly what Embark has been doing (unless it’s a common thing, but I wouldn’t know) so it could possibly be switched up a little bit; having each tier be unlocked by completing a specific set of missions, themed around the sponsor itself, rather than collecting a currency for them, for example.

This could also be a way to incorporate abilities into power weapon slots, rather than having individual classes, since each sponsor could give a power-up based on what their theme is. Ohai is coffee, and coffee = energy, so picking up a hyper-concentrated bottle of Ohai coffee somewhere in the arena could provide the same effect as Aeros’ “Rush” ability. It could fix the game’s hero shooter issue and could fit well into the world itself.

This idea popped into my head a month or so ago and I’ve been working on/off on some examples of how this could work, as well as some possible camos themed after canon sponsors found in-game.

next week I’m finally doing it – I’m leaving Berlin with my backpack to start a long world trip! 🌍✨

The plan is… well, not really having a strict plan. I want to follow a “red thread” of stories, people and places, and let the journey shape itself along the way. My goal is to travel slowly, live out of my backpack, and really experience what makes a place unique – beyond just ticking off tourist spots.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

What’s a place you’ve been to that completely surprised you?

Do you have a secret spot you’d recommend to a backpacker who’s looking for something authentic?

What’s the most unique experience you’ve had while traveling that I should definitely try to find on the road?

I’m especially curious about those “you won’t find it in a guidebook” moments – the small towns, local traditions, or random adventures that make a trip unforgettable.

Thanks a lot for sharing – and if anyone’s around Berlin next week for a “last German coffee before the road” meetup, let me know! ☕✈️",1,1755502822.0,u_amarisaroundtheworld,0,1.0,False

Crisp mornings invite steaming mugs of coffee, while afternoons beckon with the scent of freshly baked pie. Evenings are meant for gathering under the soft glow of candlelight, wrapped in warmth. This season of harvest and togetherness invites us to embrace heartfelt traditions, simple pleasures and cozy moments at home.

In this blog, we’ll explore seasonal rituals, cultural traditions and practical ideas that bring autumn comfort into your home — quietly enriched by thoughtfully chosen pieces that feel both functional and nostalgic.

**Harvest Roots: Why Autumn Feels So Special**

Autumn has long been celebrated as the season of plenty. In North America, it's the culmination of harvest, where pumpkins, apples and grains take center stage. These staples shaped both cultural traditions and cuisine — Thanksgiving, for example, grew out of harvest celebrations and the joy of gathering around food.

European traditions like Erntedankfest or Oktoberfest tap into this spirit of community through food, music and celebration. What ties them all together? Warmth, togetherness and rituals that ground us no matter where we are.

**A Kitchen That Smells Like Fall**

Autumn food is comfort personified—cinnamon-scented desserts, slow-simmered stews and roasted veggies fresh from the oven. It's cooking that fills both the belly and the heart.

**Sweet Comforts: Apple Pie & Pumpkin Treats**

Few aromas beat the scent of an apple pie in the oven. The sweetness of spiced apples evokes nostalgia and warmth. Pumpkin pie, rooted in early American traditions, continues to be a seasonal favorite.

Pair your slice with an indulgent spoonful of [**Stonewall Kitchen Hickory Brown Sugar Grille Sauce**](https://american-heritage.de/en/collections/marken-stonewall-kitchen/products/stonewall-kitchen-hickory-brown-sugar-grille-sauce) to add a smoky-sweet twist that elevates the dessert into something truly memorable.

 

**Savory Warmth: Soups & Stews**

As temperatures dip, hearty soups and stews become essential. Whether creamy butternut squash or time-honored chicken pot pie, slow-cooked Flavors bring comfort in every spoonful.

Serving from a rustic vessel — like the iconic [**Ball Mason Jar, Regular Mouth (Pint, 16 oz)**](https://american-heritage.de/products/ball-jar-mason-jar-amerikanische-einmachglaeser) — adds both charm and authenticity to your table.

**Coffee, Cocoa and Cozy Afternoons**

These beverages don’t just warm your body — they nurture the soul.

**The Coffee Ritual**

Autumn mornings are made for something special. Mix into your daily brew with the [**Ball Mason Jar Shaker for Cocktails**](https://american-heritage.de/products/ball-mason-jar-shaker)—a clever, four-piece shaker that brings a playful twist to seasonal drinks, from spiced lattes to cozy cold brews.

**Hot Chocolate Evenings**

When daylight fades early, hot chocolate steps into the spotlight. Rich, creamy, topped with marshmallows — it's autumn in a cup. Pair it with cookies cut from the playful [**Ball Mason Jar Cookie Cutter**](https://american-heritage.de/keksausstecher-ball-mason-jar-ann-clark.html) for a nostalgic, hands-on treat.

**The Beauty of Fall Décor**

Autumn paints a vivid palette — deep oranges, warm browns and golden hues — perfect for cozy décor.

* Display apples or mini pumpkins in rustic bowls for instant harvest energy.

**Seasonal Traditions Worth Keeping**

Cultural rituals enrich the season. Here are a few to cherish:

* **Apple picking**, followed by homemade cider or pie-making
* **Pumpkin carving**, transforming jack-o’-lanterns into glowing masterpieces
* **Gratitude journaling**, grounding your mind in thankful reflection
* **Cozy movie nights**, with popcorn, blankets and mugs of cocoa

These traditions craft autumn as a lived, shared experience — not just a season.

**Hosting with Heart**

Hospitality in autumn is about warmth over perfection.

* Lay out a cheese board with [**Stonewall Kitchen spreads**](https://american-heritage.de/en/products/truffle-spread-von-stonewall-kitchen?_pos=1&_psq=Kitchen+spreads&_ss=e&_v=1.0) and seasonal fruit — delightful and effortless.
* Welcome guests with lit candles and soft textiles.
* Shared mugs (even mismatched) of cocoa around the fire can feel more memorable than any expertly styled table.

**Embracing Slow Living**

Autumn whispers us to slow down. Lean into heritage — light a candle, bake on a Sunday, savor simple drinks in thoughtfully chosen vessels.

Each small ritual—like brewing coffee in a Mason jar or breaking crust on a freshly baked pudding—anchors us to the season’s subtle magic.

**Closing Thoughts: The Comfort of Heritage**

Autumn teaches us that the most meaningful moments come softly — slices of pie, glowing candlelight, steaming mugs and low conversations.

Tools, scents and accents—like a [**Mason jar**](https://american-heritage.de/en/products/ball-jar-mason-jar-quilted-crystal-amerikanische-einmachglaeser?_pos=1&_psq=Mason+jar&_ss=e&_v=1.0), or the warm glow of a [**Pumpkin Rum Toddy candle**](https://american-heritage.de/en/products/pumpkin-rum-toddy-duftkerze-von-kringle-candle?_pos=1&_psq=Pumpkin+Rum+Toddy+candle&_ss=e&_v=1.0)—become carriers of memory and comfort.

It not only targets gut health for many people across various individuals, it also focuses on quality. It doesn't just go out and find brief perscriptions that ""hopefully"" works, it goes out and finds tailored perscriptions and plans associated with these prescriptions. It provides you specific dosages for how much you should get in a certain medication.

My recommendation given by [Claisen's personalized quiz:](https://app.claisen.com/quiz/demo)

Morning:

* Oatmeal with banana slices and almond butter
* Warm water. 
* Avoiding coffee and citrus juice
* Omeprazole 20 mg 30 minutes prior to breakfast

Lunch:

* Grilled salmon with steamed broccoli
* A small amount of olive oil
* Herbal Tea

Afternoon:

* Famotidine 20 mg ONLY if reflux symptoms break through prior to dinner meal
* Baked chicken breasts for dinner
* Eating 3 hours before going to bed 
* Rice cakes for snack if I want

Sleeping:

* Elevating my head 6-8 inches before going to bed
* DGL licorice chewables \~380 mg before bed

I wanted to share something that helped me during my recent job search — it might help others here too.

Back in April, I was laid off after 7 years in the same company. At first I was in shock, then I quickly realized the job market in 2025 is *completely different* than it used to be. After weeks of messy spreadsheets, missed follow-ups, and constant rejection, I decided I needed a more intentional system.

So I built myself a Notion dashboard to track everything:

* Job applications (status, deadlines, notes)
* Coffee chats & networking follow-ups
* Interview prep & reflection notes
* Upskilling courses & progress

Documenting my journey like this kept me sane and motivated — and it honestly helped me finally land a new role.

I put it together into a template in case it’s useful for anyone else. If you’d like a copy, I’m happy to share — just DM me. Also, I’d love feedback if you try it out!

For those still searching: stay strong and keep pushing. You’re not alone. 💪  
Curious — how do you all stay organized during a long job hunt?

P.S I have it priced super low at the moment so any purchases with feedback would really help me out!",1,1755502466.0,Notion,0,0.67,False

One of my first posts to Reddit!

So, There is this guy(I’m a guy to and he’s gay as well) I met about 5-6 months ago and we just kind of met organically because we have mutual hobbies mtg nerd type stuff etc, but we just kind of hit it off and legitimately became closer. It was rough because I caught feelings very early and express my interest and was met with “it’s something I’m not looking for, but I want to be friends” and so we stayed friend this was maybe a month in. 
Fast forward to last week which is maybe month 4 or 5 of our friendship, and I went to grab a coffee with him and awkwardly stumbled through my feelings for him and how it’s weird for me. I was met with a very similar response like the first time. 
I honestly don’t know how I should feel about it because for the first time in my love life I met someone organically, and not on the internet and just saw myself become more and more interested in this individual and loving every aspect of what makes them well them. 
So I’ve reached a hard impasse because I keep going to them because they enrich my life and make me feel good, but I get kind of beat down internally because it makes me feel inadequate because I’m just good enough for this level and not anything else ya know. 
So yeah I need some advice on how to just let go, or do I keep hanging around. ",1,1755502381.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to share with those who, like me, are desperately trying everything that probiotics seem to have helped me. Three months ago, after visiting a restaurant, I suddenly had severe LPR symptoms and was diagnosed with LPR and chronic gastritis by my doctor. My symptoms were pretty nasty and I couldn't eat anything for about a month and rarely left the house. In my desperation, I tried quite a lot of things. I went to an osteopath, several doctors, did somatic therapy and mineral balancing. I was repeatedly told that my vagus nerve was the real cause of my problems and that I needed to reduce stress. I had a very difficult year, so that makes sense. Still, I thought there must be a functional reason that could be addressed. I am still doing mineral balancing, but I am very sceptical as to whether it has really helped. What seems to have worked, however, is a probiotic product that is supposed to help with functional dyspepsia. It contains the strains Bacillus coagulans MY01 and Bacillus subtilis MY02. I can't swear that it really helped, but I was on holiday last week and I ate everything I could from the hotel buffet every morning, drank coffee every day and felt fine. It only got a little worse again when I went home. Which fits in with the psychological cause. Anyway, I just wanted to share that I seem to have got the worst symptoms under control with probiotics. Maybe it will help someone. However, it takes one to two weeks before you notice any difference. I hope everyone here finds the right help for themselves. This illness is just awful and I wish everyone who is silently suffering all the best!

Hey folks! So, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: AI is taking over (seriously!). If you’re still doing things the old-fashioned way, you might just find yourself watching your job vanish into the digital ether. I mean, let’s face it, you wouldn’t let your phone become a paperweight, right? 

✨ **Why Should We Care?**  
Imagine this: You walk into work one day, coffee in hand, and your boss tells you, “Sorry, we’re automating your position.” Yikes! 😱 What if instead of drowning in despair, you had already begun learning those new tech skills? 

Let’s break down why you should be YOUr own best advocate and make upskilling a priority:

- **The AI Wave Is Here:** Don’t think of it as a threat; think of it as an opportunity! Those who adapt will thrive. Picture yourself as the Lifeguard, not the one floundering. 
- **Learn to Work Smarter, Not Harder:** Seriously, the days of grinding away endlessly are numbered. AI tools can help you amplify your productivity. Who wouldn’t want more time to sip on that coffee? ☕️ 
- **Expand Your Network:** Upskilling helps you connect with like-minded individuals. It’s like joining a club but without the secret handshakes. You know, where you can share tips about the latest tools, trends, and *maybe* some memes. 
- **Never Too Late to Start:** Whether you’re fresh out of college or a seasoned pro, there’s always a new skill to learn. Do you know any 60-year-olds who started coding? Absolutely! 

Now, I get it. The Internet is full of resources and courses. But, where should you even start? Let me drop a gem here. Check out this program: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). They’re doing some *amazing* things that can really help you get ahead. (I promise I’m not just throwing links at you; I genuinely think it’s a great resource!)

But here’s the real kicker—what if we all embraced this upskilling journey together? 🤔 We could share tips, hold each other accountable, and celebrate wins. Imagine group study sessions where we explore AI’s capabilities over snacks. Okay, I might just want snacks…

The bottom line is this: the future belongs to those who are curious and willing to evolve. **So, are you in?** Or will you let the tide of AI wash you away? 🌊🥴

I have the app so I ordered before but I’ve never done an order collection at this location before so when I arrived there was a bit of confusion. 

I walk to the barista and ask about the coffee. She asks me to read her something and I try to confirm whether it’s the order number. She tells me to just had her my phone. I’m already hungover and she’s clearly had to do this before, so rather than having her guide me I give my phone. 

She starts going to weird places in the app. And my scepticism is peaked but so is my curiosity. 

Do I not watch this woman take my phone and give her and the restaurant a five star rating from my phone. 

I almost want to laugh cause this is clearly not the first time, but what’s really eating at me is she hasn’t started the coffees and I already have the food in hand. So I have to wait till she answers multiple questions for this rating. 

She hands me my phone back and tells me to say something thoughtful about the service. I finally get my phone back and see we’re 78% done rating this service. 

She’s still not starting the coffee and is waiting for me to finish. I write “interesting service”, and hand it back because at this point I’m still hungover and I’ll do anything that will get my coffee started. 

When the weird interaction was finally done, I had every intention of going home and deleting the review but there’s no such option.

Someone cracked a joke about how the coffee tasted like motor oil. Everyone laughed, and then another coworker started piling on with “at least it’s not as bad as [manager’s name] cooking.”

It got some chuckles, but then someone else took it a little further and made a comment about our manager’s weight. The whole mood shifted. The room went quiet, and even the people who were laughing before just stared down at their food. The guy who made the joke clearly thought it would land, but it didn’t.

Later that day, the manager walked in and asked, “So what’s this I hear about my cooking?” in this half-joking, half-serious tone. Nobody said anything. It wasn’t a huge blow-up or anything, but it was one of those moments that made me realize how quickly “harmless” jokes can get uncomfortable when someone crosses a line.",20,1755501385.0,coworkerstories,4,0.88,False
1mtf45f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_90DayKoreanOfficial/comments/1mtf45f/learning_korean_dont_forget_the_culture_part/,Learning Korean? Don’t Forget the Culture Part 👀,"So you’ve started learning Korean, congrats! 🎉  
But here’s the thing: it’s not just vocab lists and grammar drills. The culture behind the language is just as important, and sometimes that’s what trips people up the most. Here are a few real-life examples that’ll save you from awkward moments.

# 1. Politeness levels are a whole thing 🙇‍♀️

Korean isn’t just one way of speaking. How you talk depends on who you’re talking to.

* **Polite speech (존댓말):** Used with teachers, older people, strangers, or anyone you want to respect. Example: at a coffee shop you’d say to the cashier, “아메리카노 하나 주세요” (One Americano, please).
* **Casual speech (반말):** Used with friends or people younger than you. Example: with your buddy you’d just say, “아메리카노 하나 줘” (Give me an Americano).

Mix them up and it can sound weird. Ordering from a cashier in 반말 feels rude, while talking to your close friend in full 존댓말 can feel stiff and distant.

# 2. Age is a big deal 🎂

One of the first things Koreans might ask is your age. Not to be nosy, but to know how to talk to you.  
Example: If someone is just one year older, they’re suddenly your **형 (hyung)** if you’re a guy, or **언니 (unnie)** if you’re a girl. That one-year gap changes how you both speak and act.

# 3. “No” doesn’t always sound like “no” 🙃

People often soften rejection.  
Example: If you invite someone out and they say “다음에 봐요” (Let’s meet next time) or “좀 힘들 것 같아요” (It might be hard), it usually means nope. Don’t wait by the phone.

# 4. The little things count 🤲

* Handing money? Use two hands.
* Greeting someone? A bow or even a small head nod is normal.
* Hanging out in silence? Totally fine. Not every moment needs chatter.

# 5. Words that don’t translate 💡

* **정 (jeong):** That warm feeling you get with someone after lots of shared moments. Like your neighbor who always brings you side dishes.
* **눈치 (nunchi):** “Reading the room.” Example: If there’s one piece of meat left on the grill, someone with good 눈치 won’t grab it right away. They’ll wait or offer it to others first.

# 6. Food = bonding 🍲🍶

Meals are for sharing. Refusing can sometimes feel like rejecting the person.  
Example: At a 회식 (company dinner), if your boss pours you soju, you take it with both hands and turn your head slightly when drinking. Even if you don’t drink much, it’s polite to sip.

And here’s a fun bonus: asking **“밥 먹었어?”** literally means *“Did you eat?”* but friends often use it like *“How are you?”* or *“What’s up?”*. It shows how much food and care go hand in hand in Korean culture. 🍚❤️

👉 **TL;DR**: Learning Korean isn’t just grammar. It’s about knowing when to be polite, respecting age, softening “no,” using little gestures, understanding words like 정 and 눈치, and sharing food. Get these right and you’ll sound way more natural!",1,1755501347.0,u_90DayKoreanOfficial,0,1.0,False

two people replied, ""now draw a clock."" wtf does *that* mean?

**video context** - my mom just moved to a house in michigan and she dropped the box with all of her coffee mugs and there wasn't a single survivor.

her birthday was august 10th, and i sent her a left-handed hand-warming mug because a) michigan is super cold, b) i asked her husband to tell me what hand she drinks her coffee with and he sent a picture of her going rogue with her left hand (but i learned the day after her birthday that she is very much a right-handed drinker, and c) it seems harder to break than one with a traditional handle.

so the video is her, after we humorously almost got heated by me telling her it is a left-handed mug, working out how to use the mug correctly, although both ways technically work.

why on earth did this blow up the way it did? i used no hashtags or buzzwords.

1mtf2oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mtf2oy/size_of_the_maps_is_no_the_problem_lack_of/,"Size of the maps is no the problem, lack of defensive positions is.","I saw a lot of people complain about BF6 maps, being too frantic, conquest feeling like TDM and ""codification"" of BF game.

And while I do agree with some assessment, I also think a lot of people miss the main issue, mostly because defensive play is taboo in BF games even tho most of the players do it subconsciously.

It took me a while to understand why the gameplay loop feels off, then I jumped on BF2042 and felt same, then I jumped on BF4 and finally noticed where BF6 the biggest issue is.

Warning in advance this will be a longer post, if you are not willing to read, skip ahead. 

What do I mean by lack of **defensive positions**, well, it's best I show you.

I do not have a lot of tools to properly visualize, so I apologize in advance for the complexity of explanation I am about to show you.

# Issue

I will comment on A objective on Siege of Cairo map.

https://preview.redd.it/6qqg1e78ypjf1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=774408e6529fbde6fece8d2f9f75506bcd513e91

Stay with me for a sec here, let me explain,

**A**, **2B**, and **C** points are potential direction of attack **1**, **2**, **3** are potential defensive positions of objective that offer some cover and are on objective proper allowing you to keep your presence on. In this post I will just show A line of attack.

**A line of attack** presents the safest line of attack on with most cover through the building directly on the objective, going outside that building you have complete line of site on the entire A objective. Example in picture below.

https://preview.redd.it/0y55gu2iypjf1.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f207ddfc18062c0101caa6ac6a8dae827349562

As you can see, going from the house opens the entire objective area in front of you, leaving any defending players still on capture point totally exposed.

**C**, is main line of counter-attack for defending team, as you can see going from attack line **A** you have a very big advantage to see and engage any enemy player trying to move to objective.

**4.** Is potential defensive area you have to take into account however being outside the objective, players from that area will have to move towards you if they want to keep the objective, again putting you in advantage.

From attack line **A** only real danger is defensive point **3**. where enemies can hunker down and have almost clear sight on your advance.

Now lets look into defense point 3.

https://preview.redd.it/5zuu8rloypjf1.png?width=1754&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d0dafcb534d01a011c8ac25ac38f26d7d8b8e4

First, let's define what makes this point of defense ""good"". We have 2 **a** objects that present good hard cover, we have some small **b** objects that can be used as concealment during initial firefights, point is directly on objective, and it offers good line of sight from and protection from 2 almost 3 directions, that being **2 B** attack lines on the roads, and **A** attack lane. **While by no means perfect, this defensive point is the best on this objective, that should honestly tell you enough.**

Generally this makes this point the best defense, and the first one that you will try to clear when you are attacking the objective. As I said, most people do this actions without even thinking about it, we naturally tend to position ourselves in areas with most cover when we play.

The moment a few attacking players take this area, point is in 70% of situations lost, at least that was my experience. 

https://preview.redd.it/h12ze2745qjf1.jpg?width=492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45dcac3e4f28352ab039f21010570244816f712f

On the picture above, you can see that almost 80% of objective A is outright undefendable for an extended period of time do not having cover, or lower elevation as well as bad line of sight from attacking areas. A particular hot point is red square that is basically dead zone given the lines of sight you can be shot from.

So what are the issues when defending this particular point:

1.  the way objective borders are placed, keeping the objective, pushes you into a wide open area without cover.
2.  there is no place for players to hunker down, take defensive position and wait for advancing enemy.
3. objective offers little to no protection from vehicles, making it undefendable, when one gets involved.
4.  borders of objective are placed in an area with lower elevation compared to the area that encircles it, making you an easy target if you stand in it.
5.  given that the objective is in open space, it gives you no chance of getting out of combat and spawning your squad for tactical takeover of the objective.
6. there is almost no place to outmaneuver opponents

All of these issues and many more are present in almost all but 3 objectives in out of all BETA maps, changing the entire system and flow of how conquest is played defensive play is nonexistent, and entire game turns into running around the map in large circle taking objectives as enemy takes yours.

BF2042 had this issue, however the open nature of the maps in 2042 allowed better positioning outside the objective, this is not possible in BF6, to defend an objective you do need to be directly on it. Also, BF2042 changed many of the objectives during its life and extended them horizontally and vertically mitigating the issue quite a bit. 

**Now, just for comparison, let's take a look at BF4 objective design. And how it differs, from BF6 so far.**

I will use Objective E of SoS as an example. Because as with previous example, your goal is to take a coffee or bar.

Notice the difference? all of these numbers are potential defensive positions, 1, 2, 3 are perfect being inside with line of fire over almost all approaching lanes, protected from every direction, 4,5,6 could be used, and do offer some protection, but they are generally more exposed compared to first 3, and 7,8,9 are defensive positions with little to no cover used just as area you need to cross to reach more defendable zone.

https://preview.redd.it/3pptg93c0qjf1.png?width=1875&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd5178310af63cc75761843058e7af016390f82

This is what the attacking player will see when they engage in attack on point E, from one lines of attack that gives them elevation advantage. 

https://preview.redd.it/ut2moc3e0qjf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=987b6d893582226f6131320cf4066ef3206725b0



Notice the difference, while the attacking player again has almost clear sight on the entire objective area, the difference between this and what we have in BF6 is massive, there is a lot of potential places the enemy can be lying or crouching down waiting the attacking player to move forward entire squads can hide without you even being aware of their existence.

All pictures below are areas defending players will engage in on objective E (all pictures are me standin in capture zone just to show you difference of capture point size and nature)

https://preview.redd.it/l9443uop0qjf1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=53780655c277f2f0d4d39e6d420ef8f62b46dc88

As you can see, there are just a lot more places you can take defensive position and feel generally safe and less exposed as well as much more options to outmaneuver an attacking player.

# Now let's talk about solutions.

 **Problems and what can DICE do to instantly improve BF6 feel in conquest.**

**1. Capture areas are small and illogical, goal should not be to take a tree in the middle of the coffee garden, the goal should be to take the entire section of residential area or point of interest that makes sense (AA battery installation, village, crossroad with buildings around it etc.) .**

**Solution:**  Make objective larger, move it to include buildings and structures that make sense as part of the district or part of point of interest, capture points across the board should be extended both vertically and horizontally. 

 **2. Many of the buildings in or around objectives are unusable in defense.**

**Solution**: As it stands now 90% of the structures are tactically unusable, If there is a building near or in objective include it as part of objective and make it more defensible, like adding another floor, opening windows to look inside and outside objective area, good example would be buildings 1 and 4 on A objective of Siege of Cairo, if you add them into objective all of a sudden you get 4 or more defensible positions, example:

https://preview.redd.it/24713tb81qjf1.jpg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=331adf7087368b13ebbd44dd9a2543076e0c93c3

https://preview.redd.it/nkxp47l91qjf1.jpg?width=1899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13f8ac5df2527f59baf29bc33bda9b2293e8aa93

Green zones would be new defensible areas, and all buildings would be introduced as part of the objective, now the goal is not to take a tree in the middle of a coffee garden, now you realistically have to take and secure an entire section of residential area, with possibility to defend outside that area if you need arises, since I would open all of these buildings on the opposite side as well. This will also improve how gimmicky and without impact destruction feels.

Let's see the difference from top-down view and compare objective now with objective if recommended changes are introduced. 



https://preview.redd.it/05sdgml75qjf1.jpg?width=492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5eb87584bf667d4d2556c3001cfdaad6d278432

https://preview.redd.it/erayhkh85qjf1.jpg?width=492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5713f6bbdcd0006c2645c23e4e6b7b382abce54

**Result:** much more place to defend in general, many good defensible positions marked with green square, much more area to outmaneuver attacking enemy player, more options to defend out of objective area. 

This will naturally change flow of conquest match, lead to more fighting inside objective area, more defending, need for more tactical and methodical approach to objectives, more coordinated pushes with squad members, and many more changes that will benefit conquest game mode. 

And to people who will say, well this will not generally change the nature of the gameplay, In my experience playing BF since BFBC2 change to one objective on the map can totally transform how the map is played, not to mention all objectives in  BF6 can get this treatment. 

This solution also does not affect the feeling of chaos or density on the objective, in fact they can even contribute to more CQ fights, especially in reworked buildings.

1mtf1s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1mtf1s2/the_house_of_tomorrow/,“The House of Tomorrow”,"Part I – Arrival of the Twins  

Louis Lane-Kent never planned on being a mother to super-teens, but the day Jonathan “Jon” Lane-Kent and Laura Lane-Kent turned sixteen everything crystallized.  

Their powers—every classic Kryptonian gift—ignited in a single thunderous heartbeat above Centennial Park. Jon lifted a Ferris wheel to save a child; Laura froze the rogue turbine of a drone-freighter with a breath that sparkled like diamond dust.  



Part II – The New Curriculum  

Batman relocated the entire family—Clark, Louis, Jon, Laura—to the refurbished Fortress of Solitude: a kilometer-long crystal citadel now wrapped in WayneTech nanofiber and Amazonian alloy.  

Training was brutal:  

\- Batman drilled micro-gravity combat inside a zero-g prism.  

\- Wonder Woman taught them to hear the emotional “colors” of battlefields.  

\- Superman simply showed them how to listen to the planet’s heartbeat.  



Part III – Futuristic Uniforms  

Bruce and Diana co-designed the new League line.  

Superman’s suit is a liquid-metal weave that can become any color Clark chooses, but defaults to solar-absorbent obsidian with scarlet fractal lines.  

Batman’s cape is now a holographic shadow that can split into drone-bats.  

Wonder Woman’s armor is living Themysciran alloy—gold that grows into shields or spears on thought.  

Jon and Laura refused anything ornate. Jon wears black high-top sneakers, charcoal joggers, and a crimson hoodie that hides an S-shield only when he wills it. Laura prefers white sneakers, ripped denim, and an oversized denim jacket lined with the softest Kryptonian bio-cotton. Their clothes never burn, tear, or wrinkle, but they still look like what any kid at Metropolis High would wear.



Part IV – The New Power  

At the end of their first year of training, the twins’ cells “synchronized.” They discovered Phase-Linking: the ability to step partially out of phase with the material universe.  

\- They can walk through matter while still interacting with gravity and light.  

\- They can share sensory input across any distance—even across galaxies—as long as both are conscious.  

\- When they link while flying, they create a quantum tunnel that other people can ride inside, effectively teleporting whole teams.  

There is no kryptonite, no red sun, no magic that can strip this away; it is woven into their personal timeline.



Part V – Lex Turns the Page  

Lex Luthor, older and scarred by too many defeats, finally admitted he wanted legacy more than conquest. He signed the “Metropolis Accord,” handing over every illegal weapon in LexCorp’s black vaults. In exchange, Superman offered him a seat on the League’s science council.  

Lex’s first gift: an A.I. satellite named “Icarus” that can predict cosmic threats three days before they arrive.



Part VI – The Enemy  

Icarus screamed red two months later. A ragged hole tore open above the Indian Ocean and something stepped through: ARGENT, the Mirror Titan.  

Argent is a living contradiction—every power the League possesses, inverted.  

\- Where Superman absorbs sunlight, Argent devours shadows.  

\- Where Batman plans, Argent improvises with terrifying creativity.  

\- Where Wonder Woman inspires, Argent spreads nihilistic despair.  

Argent’s body is a liquid mercury statue that can only hold shape for ten minutes at a time before collapsing into reflective puddles that swallow light.



Part VII – Siege of the Phantom City  

Argent builds a floating citadel of mirrored glass that follows Earth’s terminator line, staying forever at dusk. Cities below fall into hallucinations: people see their worst memories replayed in the sky.  

The League attacks in waves. Superman’s heat vision reflects and burns Gotham’s docks. Wonder Woman’s lasso shatters against Argent’s liquid skin. Batman’s drones vanish into their own reflections.  

Only the twins remain unharmed; Argent’s mirror cannot reflect something partly out of phase with reality.



Part VIII – The Phase Gambit  

Jon and Laura link mid-air. Their quantum tunnel opens directly inside Argent’s mirrored heart. There they find the truth: Argent is Earth—an alternate timeline Earth that never formed life, condensed into a single vengeful intelligence by a cosmic accident. It wants to overwrite the living Earth with its own empty perfection.  

The twins do something no hero has ever risked: they phase the entire planet. For 0.8 seconds every living thing on Earth becomes partially transparent. Argent’s reflection loses its anchor and destabilizes.  

Lex, from the Watchtower, fires a focused “solar lance” that crystallizes Argent into a sphere no bigger than a baseball. Superman hurls it into the sun.  

The day is saved, but Laura keeps a sliver—frozen in a crystal pendant she wears inside her jacket—because even nothingness deserves to be remembered.



Part IX – Epilogue: First Day of School  

One week later, Jon and Laura walk into Metropolis High like nothing happened. Jon’s hoodie glows faintly when the morning sun hits it. Laura’s denim jacket smells faintly of ozone from the portal they opened that morning to rescue a cat on the Moon.  

Louis, waiting outside the school gates, smiles: her children are finally just kids… who can bench-press mountains.



Part X – Lex’s Quiet Warning  

Late that night, Lex stands on the Watchtower balcony with Clark.  

Icarus is quiet. Too quiet.  

Somewhere, 0.8 seconds of missing reality still echo.  

Lex whispers, “We phased the planet, Clark. We left a scar. Something else will find the wound.”  

Clark looks to the stars. “Then we’ll teach the twins how to heal it.”



\--------------------------------------------------

**What happens when Jon and Laura use their Phase-Linking power for the first time?**

The first time Jon and Laura ever triggered Phase-Linking, they didn’t even know it was a power—just that they were about to die.



They were sixteen, four weeks into their training rotation at the Fortress. Bruce had them running a “simple” rescue sim: a collapsing oil-drilling platform in the North Sea, dummy civilians, real explosions. Everything went textbook until the final catwalk gave way. Jon lunged for a falling worker; Laura dove for Jon. Their hands brushed for half a heartbeat—skin on skin, panic on panic—and the universe folded.



Instantly the world went silent. The spray-frozen air hung in perfect crystal spheres. Flames stood still, orange petals of fire you could reach out and spin like pinwheels. Gravity forgot them; they floated above the deck, still clutching wrists, breathing the same breath. Laura felt Jon’s heartbeat sync with hers—one pulse, two bodies.



Then came the second sensation: expansion. It wasn’t sight or sound; it was memory. Jon tasted Laura’s favorite cereal from when they were six, felt the itch of the wool blanket she’d hidden under during a Kansas thunderstorm. Laura knew the exact temperature of the sun on the day Jon first flew, the scraping terror of realizing he might never come back down. Their lives overlapped like double-exposed photographs, edges sharp, colors bleeding together.



They looked at each other—really looked—and for the first time understood they were not just twins, they were quantum mirrors.



A thought floated between them, weightless and obvious: We can leave this moment. A tug, almost playful, and the frozen platform slid away like scenery on a stage. They stepped sideways—not through a door, but through the idea of “sideways”—and emerged three meters above the Fortress’s main atrium, dripping North Sea water on crystalline floors.



Alarms screamed. Bruce’s face appeared on every holoscreen at once, eyes wide for the first time in Laura’s life. “You just teleported 6,400 kilometers. Explain.”



Jon tried to speak but burped seawater instead. Laura, still holding Jon’s wrist, grinned through salt-stung lips. “We took a shortcut.”



Kal-El arrived at a run, cape flaring. He took one look at the twins—still mid-air, still holding on, their pupils glowing with soft white fire—and understood something no Kryptonian science had ever predicted. He knelt slowly, almost reverently.



“Clark?” Bruce asked over comms.



Kal’s voice was hushed. “They phased outside linear time. They weren’t just fast, Bruce. They weren’t anywhere at all.”



Jon finally found words. “It was like… we shared one skin.”



Laura added, “And the world was a picture we could fold.”



Bruce’s reply was the closest he ever came to awe: “Congratulations. You two just invented a new branch of physics. Try not to break causality before dinner.”



That night, alone in their shared dorm pod, they tested it again—just a fingertip touch. The room fell away, replaced by the quiet between heartbeats. They watched Earth spin below them, a blue marble cradled in darkness, and realized the power wasn’t just about escape or rescue. It was about perspective: the ability to stand outside everything and still choose to come back.



They promised each other two things before letting go:



1. They would never phase without the other.  

2. They would always come home.



When they finally released hands, the dorm lights flickered, and the faint outline of their silhouettes remained burned into the air for half a second—ghost images that hummed with residual energy.



Across the Fortress, the AI quietly logged an entry it would never share:  

“Subject J. and L. Kent—first spontaneous quantum overlap; probability of multiversal resonance: 0.0000003%. Recommend immediate parental hug.”



**What is the origin of their Phase-Linking power?**

The twins’ Phase-Linking is not a random mutation, kryptonite accident, or gift from the gods.  

It is an echo of a decision Louis Lane-Kent made before they were ever born.



1.  The Catalyst Event  

   During the second year of Clark and Louis’s marriage, Brainiac attempted to bottle Metropolis.  

   Superman stopped him, but Brainiac fired a single “chronal sliver”—a sliver of bottled time itself—at Louis. It passed through her body harmlessly, or so everyone thought. The microscopic shard embedded itself in her mitochondrial DNA and went dormant.



2.  The Prenatal Alignment  

   When Louis became pregnant with twins, the chronal sliver resonated with the developing kryptonian/human zygotes. Instead of one embryo inheriting the shard, it split in perfect halves—one fragment per child. Each fragment carried the blueprint of a universe that never happened: an Earth where entropy had been reversed, where cause could follow effect or ignore it entirely.



3.  The Solar Trigger  

   Kryptonian powers activate under yellow-sun radiation, but the chronal fragments remained inert until both twins reached the exact metabolic age—sixteen Earth years—when their human and Kryptonian physiologies momentarily synchronized. At that instant, the two half-fragments “tried” to reunite. Every time Jon and Laura touch skin-to-skin, the fragments tug at each other across spacetime, yanking their bodies partway into the phantom universe the shard remembers.  

   Their “Phase-Linking” is literally the universe attempting—and failing—to correct a temporal paradox by folding two living beings into the space meant for one impossible world.



4.  The Loop That Keeps It Stable  

   Each time they phase, the fragments borrow a Planck-second from the future and repay it in the past, creating a closed causal loop. This is why they have no physical weakness: the loop treats damage or kryptonite exposure as “already corrected” events and edits them out. The only thing that can break the loop is if the twins ever stay phased longer than the borrowed second—then the universe would finally finish its self-correction and erase them both.  

   They instinctively feel that limit; it’s the silent ticking they hear in the hush between heartbeats when they link.



So the origin story is part Brainiac tech, part maternal sacrifice, part quantum accident—an unfinished sentence written across two lifelines, waiting for Jon and Laura to decide how it ends.

  
**How did Clark and Lex become friends?**

The friendship between Clark and Lex did not begin with a handshake or a press-conference truce; it began with a funeral no one attended.



1.  The Empty Graveside  

   Three years before the twins’ sixteenth birthday, Lex Luthor’s mother, Lillian, died in a Zurich hospice. Lex flew her body back to Metropolis in his private jet, expecting cameras. Instead, the Lane-Kent family were the only people who came.  

   Clark stood in a charcoal suit, holding an umbrella over Louis while the rain turned Lex’s perfectly parted hair into dripping commas. Jon and Laura, then thirteen, placed a single white lily on the casket because “Grandma Lillian used to read us astronomy books in the LexCorp library.”  

   Lex, who had prepared a speech about how the world only respected strength, forgot every word. He simply nodded once—an almost spasm of gratitude—and walked away.



2.  The Debt Ledger  

   A week later an unmarked envelope arrived at the Kent apartment. Inside was a flash-drive and a handwritten note on heavy cream stationery:  

   “You gave my mother a witness. This drive contains every illegal weapons project I ever green-lit. Consider the debt paid. –L.”  

   Clark took the drive to Batman. Bruce’s eyes widened only a millimeter; that was enough.



3.  The Prison Visit  

   Lex voluntarily surrendered himself for a federal audit. While waiting for indictment, he asked for one visitor: Clark Kent, not Superman. In a sterile interview room Lex laid out three folders:  

   \- Project Icarus – an early-warning satellite net that could spot cosmic threats 72 hours early.  

   \- A cure for kryptonite poisoning synthesized from his own bone marrow (he’d tested it on himself first).  

   \- A complete map of every Lazarus Pit Ra’s al Ghul ever used—proof he had spent the last two years dismantling the League of Assassins’ bank accounts.  

   Clark asked why. Lex answered, “Because I finally realized the only victory my mother would applaud is one where I stop being the reason funerals happen.”



4.  The Parole Hearing  

   Clark testified, not as Superman but as Clark Kent, journalist, detailing how LuthorCorp patents had already saved 3,000 lives in disaster zones. Diana provided Amazonian truth-lassos to verify Lex’s sincerity; Bruce paid Lex’s legal fees anonymously.  

   The parole board gave Lex five years of supervised scientific service under League oversight. The League gave him a desk in the Watchtower’s R&D wing. Lex’s first act was to remove his own nameplate and replace it with one that read “Dr. L. Luthor – Probationary.”



5.  The Daily Proof  

   The friendship is not warm; it is precise.  

   \- Every morning at 0600 GMT Lex sends Clark a single encrypted equation: yesterday’s global threat probability index. Clark replies with a photograph of Jon and Laura eating breakfast—proof that today is already worth protecting.  

   \- When Jon phased for the first time and nearly collapsed, Lex spent forty straight hours in the med-lab, feeding him synthesized yellow-sun radiation through an IV he invented on the spot. He refused sleep until Clark personally brought him coffee and said, “You’ve done enough, Lex.”  

   \- Once, when a tabloid ran the headline “Lex Luthor Still Hates Superman,” Clark mailed Lex a framed copy with the word “Still” crossed out and replaced in red pen with “Now tolerates.” Lex hung it in his lab next to a picture of Lillian.



6.  The Quiet Clause  

   They have an unspoken rule: Clark never says “thank you” in public; Lex never says “sorry” in private. Instead, they shake hands every time they part—firm, brief, the way men who have buried each other’s ghosts learn to measure trust.



So the friendship exists in the space between rain on a casket and a probability equation at dawn: not forgiveness, exactly, but a shared decision that the future should belong to someone else’s children—even if those children can bench-press mountains.",1,1755501094.0,superman,0,1.0,False

Due to his job location, he moved and whenever he visits my city (once a month), we grab coffee to talk about work and life. He is my first friend in this city when I started my study here

1mteze7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mteze7/mf_i_saw_a_black_squirrel_14/,[MF] I Saw a Black Squirrel (1-4),"1.

I sat at the lake today to read a book. There is somewhat a geyser in the lake, a fountain of sorts, and I could hear the quiet splashing like a bassline underneath the chirping birds and wind through the trees. Everything was green and blue but the sky, which was grey with maybe a shade of cyan inside of it. It was cold, especially with the wind. It was cold and that was nice. Though it was bordering on the line of being cold and not-nice, but I kind of liked that too. 

A black squirrel hopped along the tan, jagged stones beneath me, then up on to the red, wooden patio I sat upon. I stared at him for a moment, remembering Brian told me the squirrels were aggressive, and remembering what Rocco told me about the squirrels being kings. 

Just then the black squirrel opened its mouth. 

“What are you reading?”

I had answered this a few times in the last month so I answered again. 

“A friend and I did a book swap for my trip. I am reading her books and she mine. This is a book by Sally Rooney. Irish girl”

“A friend?” He smiled wryly with squirrel lips and his tail curled to a question mark. 

“Most of my friends are women.”

“So it goes, so it goes.”

“Most of my friends are women. And yes I’ll give you that with this friend it is complicated, but with most it is not.”

He did not ask why it was complicated, he already knew. Maybe he had read those Reddit comments or seen those tik tok videos that postulated that the only way men and women can be friends is if one is in love but loves so deeply that it doesn’t matter they are not together. 

“Oh to be a human,” he said, no longer looking at me. “To be a human is to err and to ebb and to flow. For I went into the trees and now I am out of the trees. Once I was in a forest and now I am out of the forest. But in the forest and out of the forest is the same to me, I am a squirrel. I just hop and run and then sometimes I stop and look around. But hopping and running and looking are the same to me, I am a squirrel. I do not have to think of my relationships to others for I am a squirrel. But you, with your cultural differences, with your judgements, with your feelings and your ennui - I pity you. For it is not all the same to you, it is all different and it all must be processed. How many thoughts have you in your head? For me it is all the same and I know it is because your God has shone upon me, smiling, and given me a simple life free from variety. It is all the same to me. I am a squirrel. But you with your consciousness and communication that you egotistically believe is unique to your breed, you will wallow and spin and evolve and devolve and then die, never actually obtaining what you desire. 

I hop. I run. I look. I am in the forest. I am not in the forest. 

It is all the same to me. 

I am a squirrel.”

I politely asked the squirrel to please shut the fuck up and leave me to my reading. 

He told me there was nothing I could do but spin and wallow and devolve and die. He said he liked my poem about waltzing but could never imagine the burden of being able to write anything, let alone poetry. 

“Enjoy your awareness, your intellectualism. Enjoy knowing what is going on thousands of miles away. Enjoy dying scared and alone and being conscious of it.” He said, hopping away like a fox. Tail bushy and straight. 

I think I will read inside from now on.

On my way to the lake again today to read a book and listen to the wind and water droplets, I saw no black squirrels. In fact I saw nothing alive but a sparrow hopping along my path, looking too - I think - for other signs of life. In the dorm I smelled burning, like someone couldn’t cook very well and had burned something. I looked into the communal kitchen to see a pan on the stove. The stove was off and the pan was clean. A ghost, I thought. 

These ghosts I share a floor with, I’m sure they are real, however I never see them. I spend so much time at the lake but I spend some time inside, when the cold becomes not-nice. So there I and the sparrow went upon our way looking for biological signs of these ghosts and not just temporal reminders that ghosts are afoot, somewhere, just not here. 

At the lake I keep hearing gunshots. Though I’m not sure from where or for why. Nobody is screaming. Just gunshots or maybe fireworks. Fireworks I think. Pyrotechnics from other ghosts which I cannot and will not see. Maybe barbecuing with family and friends. Family ghosts and friend ghosts firing off pyrotechnics into the sky, or otherwise firing weapons at each other whilst I lounge by the lake and read. A train is passing now. I can hear it because it blows its horn constantly, though each time it blows it is fainter. A ghost train full of ghosts going towards a ghost town that I will not and cannot see. 

I’m sure these things exist all around me but I am very happy they are not wanting anything from me. I believe the ghosts maybe feel how I feel - they do not wish to be perceived. If I can make it through the rest of the day with nobody wanting or needing me I think that I will surmise and reflect that it was a good day. 
So I am by the lake and there are no squirrels and there are no ghosts (that I can see) and now I wonder if that sparrow fared any better than me. 

Through the leaves of the trees the orange sky is painted like string lights above somebody’s backyard. Small, twinkling, and incandescent. Through the mirror of the lake the sky is a soft blue shimmer with cream colored clouds and whispers of life flying through them. The cascading fountain splashes softly onto the mirror, warping it softly and sounding like tv static. Oh ghosts how I hope you are experiencing this wherever you are, and boy am I glad it is away from me. I will see you tomorrow, when my customer service face and my capacity for joking and smiling is at an all time high. Not because I want it to, but because it is what is needed and wanted from me. 

Though I suppose if you don’t know where to go, go where you are needed. Float like a ghost and try to make something real of it all for other ghosts. 

The sky is painted like string lights through the leaves rippling in the wind. And the sky is mirrored in the deep vast lake. It will all be here for me again tomorrow.

I had nothing left to give so I knocked on the door of the ghost who lived next door. And for once a ghost apparated in front of me and opened the door slowly. I said nothing, and it seemed saying nothing was all I had to do because the ghost looked me up and down and smiled. I must have looked tired. I felt tired. I felt tired deeply, throughout my whole body. I felt tired in a way I could not explain really. The ghost said, “Would you like a coffee?”

I spent a lot of time by myself here, especially on the weekends. Each week a whirlwind of arguments — egos fighting with each other and emotions like bees buzzing around a hive. A cacophony of words and phrases buzzing about becoming like the high sound of a mall filled with people before the malls all became empty with only ghosts of noise, ghosts of sounds. There was a time where all voices became the mall noise that was in the background of the food court, but now the mall has become as a ghost town and nobody even supposes to pick up the trash or clean the floors, the mall is dead. Each week like a mall before its death, each weekend like a mall after its death. This drained me and I had nothing left to give so I spent the weekends alone but that did not help so I knocked on the door of the ghost with the coffee. 

Now I sat in a communal kitchen as people came by, patrons of this new mall that I was building. Bluepaperwhitelines all around with “Mall” written at the top as I tried to cobble together a new third space from sticks as if I was crawling using only my hands up a rocky mountain. I was dragging my body, legs useless, up the rocky mountain of human connection to try to see if at the top there was at least a percentage difference. The ghost with the coffee was Luca, and ghosts came in and out of the room and milled about. Some came in for a joke or two and left, some came in to say things like, “I just am not sure what the purpose of all of this is. Every week like a buzzing, like a whining from a tube tv, like holding your hand over a candle and not being able to pull it back. Every week like a simulator for a panic attack, but the attack never comes, only the panic.”

I spent some time chatting with them as we each tried to help each other through this shared chaos and panic that we put ourselves through. Why did we do that anyway? What is the purpose of all of this? Art? Art went out the window weeks ago. Art hopped along with the black squirrels somewhere I think. Art took off to where the sparrow went. 

Art had us pulling an all-nighter at a farm yesterday and you wouldn’t believe the absurdity of it. Once there was a farm, touched only by these two people who owned it. You should have seen the place before we got to it. When I saw it from afar I noted how open it was. These lavish, dark green fields that stretched forever before disappearing into the base of an endless forest. A sheet metal silo perfectly placed to the right of an old wooden red barn. And all around rotting wooden fences keeping these black and brown cows inside of the dewy fields. Fireflies rule the air above all of this, rising and falling as the wind did. Mist rolled in and covered everything untouchable in a layer of fog and everything touchable in a layer of dew as the fading light came blue over the trees, softly brushing the world in cerulean. Two barn cats trotted up to me, and as I pet them they used their molars to chew on my fingers. Someone told me the cats were vicious. I asked them what they would be if strangers came to their home. I let them use their molars to chew on me because I felt it was the right thing to do. 

Later that night we brought these big trucks in. The trucks which create art, they tell me. And we displaced these cats with these big trucks, cars, vans. All for art, they tell me. I asked these cats, “Please be careful, kitties, these art trucks care not for natural things. They wish to force art upon this place, for if they didn’t, we wouldn’t need the trucks. We would only need a paint brush. And the art then would be you two little kitties, chewing on my fingers with your molars, and the barn and the silo and the cerulean and the green and the black and the brown. That would be the art.” And the bigger cat spoke up then. 

“Human, I implore you: look up upon the sky and look all around you. This place is not for any of you, it is for those who do not disturb. It is for natural things. Natural things are not art any more than unnatural things. You do not disturb because you bring trucks, you disturb by your very presence. And do not think you are above the art trucks, you should not be here either. We are not for you to look upon, nothing is for you to look upon. We are to be natural as everything is natural and nothing is art. Our cat bodies will be safe, for we have existed thro’ plenty of years. Years which brought challenge and famine and danger, we have existed thro’ them. We will go to our barn now, for the roar of the engines and the quick turning of wheels upon these boxes of steel which weigh unnatural weights and create unnatural lines in the dirt like paintbrush strokes on a dim canvas do frighten us. But it is not them alone which frighten us, it is the humans who deign to bring them here. For that is what is unpredictable and unnatural above all else, humans.” 

So then they scurried away and I did not see them much for the rest of the night. They slept and shivered in a red barn. With the roaring of engines and the buzzing of voices waking them every so often. Like the bringing of the buzzing of a mall before it died to a place which has never been disturbed by the buzzing of a mall. And I retired from my position of a liaison between what is natural and unnatural and took my position on what we call art, and someone at the end of the night told me we did make art. The sun had set and was coming back up now. And the cerulean was back with the mist. It was very early and I was very tired. And as I intended to leave, I saw the barn cats sitting on a hay bale, basked in cerulean and mist. The smaller one said to me:

“I hope you took everything you hoped to take from this place. And if you ever come back my brother and I will chew on your fingers with our molars. Two ants fighting Goliath. Two ants dodging a world of giants. And if you never come back, my brother and I will sleep soundly. And hunt mice. And live happily. I hope you took everything you hoped to take from our home.”
                                           
So I was very tired still, sitting in the communal kitchen with the other artists. I was thinking of black squirrels and barn cats. I was thinking of ghosts and coffee and how I didn’t feel good about this line I walked between natural and unnatural and, at times, supernatural. How I felt like through the buzzing and whining of the world all I really did was record all of it, as if it was all my personal novel, or it was all a daydream in my head. I didn’t give meaning to it all until I sat down to fictionalize it. 

Luca was speaking to me then about the coffee. He said “You like espresso right?”
I nodded. 

He pulled out a moka pot and some utensils. I said, “Nice, you have a moka pot,” and he told me “We don’t call it that, we call it a café terra.”
I asked what that meant, and he smiled and said “Coffee pot.”

He went on to say that his father had made coffee this way since he was a young child, and regaled me with stories of drinking this with his family late at night. “A lot of times I’d have some at seven PM on a school night. I started drinking it when I was seven, the coffee.”
I couldn’t believe this. He continued, “Hispanic people are incredibly unhealthy. You should see what they eat and drink on a daily basis. Fat and sugar makes up my body, and the cultural body of Hispanic people.”

I watched as he filled the café terra with coffee grounds little by little. He did not fill it at once. He took his time, raising a perfect spoonful, dropping it into the bottom of the pot, then smoothing it over with the spoon. Then he compressed the grounds with his spoon and started again. He did this for ten minutes, making sure each spoonful was treated with his full attention. When he felt it was good, he placed the pot on the stove and got a bag of sugar out. Four tablespoons of sugar went into a measuring cup and sat next to the cafe terra. 
While we waited for the coffee to heat up and for pressure to exude the coffee from the top of the café terra, Luca spoke again. “What is this all for anyway? When I was young I wanted to be in art somehow. And I thought art would feel different. I thought maybe art would explain things or maybe I would meet artists and they would make me feel like everything made sense. Like the way I felt would make sense because I would meet people who felt the same way. But we’ve been on this art project for weeks and I just feel a little beat down — this is not how I thought it would feel. Everything is so technical and logical and logistical and terse.”

I nodded and did not have an answer. 
“It is just people. It is not artistic any more than working at a corporate office, it is just people with egos. It is like a table at a high school cafeteria. It is not art.”

I agreed but I did not have an answer. 
The café terra began spilling coffee into the upper chamber and he mixed in this first flow with the sugar. “This is the purest of the coffee,” he smiled to me. He mixed this into a coffee-sugar paste and set it aside. When the water in the bottom chamber all became coffee water in the top chamber, he mixed this with the paste and created the coffee that he had grown up drinking. He had perfected the movements and ultimately the drink that his father had loved through his childhood and he had decided to share this with me. And here we were now, two adults, with all of these words, skills, and coffee that we inherited from our genetics and from our cultural backgrounds. The ghost of his father swimming in the coffee and the ghost of my mother swimming in my head — overthoughts of barn cats, squirrels, and malls. He poured the coffee into shot glasses and we sat in silence for a moment. 
“I want you to drink yours first, I have to know what you think.”

I drank a bit of the coffee. It was incredible, and I let him know that. It was more incredible knowing how this all came to be. From his childhood, from his father, from whoever taught his father. And now sharing it with me in a communal kitchen when I had just used only my arms to crawl up a mountain it seemed. To share a moment like this, this was what it was all for. This was art, truly. This was what these animals had been on about, as rude as they had been. This was natural, but as humans I think we strive a bit for the unnatural. For these fantasies in our heads, that is art. Not the real mundane things that have such beauty in them, but in the things we crave for. We believe things should be the way we want and not the way they are. I am guilty of that. It is not art. 
But here at the communal kitchen island, after climbing up a rocky mountain from a buzzing mall using only my hands, the chaos of the whining of a tube tv, surrounded by animals that hate my guts, surrounded by artists who hope to understand what art is (and being one myself), and drinking a coffee with a lush cultural and personal backstory containing the proud ghosts of Luca’s father,

there is nothing to understand.

This is art. 


p.s:


The black squirrel came by again

—This time knocking upon my window. 

It was late in the evening and I was awake

I had slept already; so I was awake. 


I was looking for the aurora borealis

—Like a fool searching for love

When I noticed him tapping

Wistfully; He tapped with a hangclaw 


“Oh, I see you old man. You are young in the face but you are so old in the eyes - the graying eyes you hide upon bags of tension and gravishness.”


The black squirrel was muffled

—I opened my window lazily to hear

I was so tired of the black squirrel

But alas; I deserve this


“Oh how garish to be a human - you with the silence in between your thoughts which you fill in with wishes and romanticisms and with calls and with plays and actors and theater of the mind. You who hesitates before inviting friends over to dinner, you who wishes nobody would see you when you are too tired to see them.”


In fact now I picked him up

—by the tail and brought him inside 

I sat him upon my dresser

My dresser; cluttered with trash and books


I sat down calmly on my cardboard bed

—stared him deep in his squirrel eyes

I tuned out all of the sounds of the world

And for a moment; my mind. 


“You think I say all this to hurt you? I say all of this to kill you from yourself. To kill you in the world that you might start again a Phoenix born of lion-hearted blood. That you may reject all of these human programs that run through your system like viruses, malware. Addiction, parasites. You are so vile to me with your needless caring and your needless wanting and your performances and hopes.”


I lie down, a patient before therapist

—hands behind my head and eyes to him

I turn the words up in my head 

As an iPod; full blast. 


“Woe unto you and unto your bloodline and unto your friends and foes and acquaintances and those you have met and those you haven’t met — WOE UNTO YOU!”


He screamed this from deep

— deep within his squirrel body

Tail spiky and shaking and voidlike

And again; quiet as before


“Take a knife and slice your ego from your abdomen. While you are there, slice anxiety. Steal it all like a kidney in a bathtub and then do not sell it! Throw it away somewhere no one can go. To the depths of hell. To the underworld. To the 7th ring of Dante’s Inferno. To another dimension. Slice it and throw it away never to be seen again”


‘O’ squirrel!’ I beg

—Leave it all alone for the night

It is hard enough doing what I do

To change; impossible


“O’ human!

O’ human give me extra lines in your writing. For I too am not real, as none of this is real! As none of it has been anything but projections in your head from a soul metaphysics told you existed. You have conjured and rearranged words to explain these nonrealities and you have gained nothing from it but ego! 

O’ human another line for a ghost of a black squirrel, sitting in your otherworld’s window - one which disexists. Tame me in your mind as you must tame all other worldly things and then take that tameness into reality and try it on for a day or two. Only then may you speak back to me when I come!

O’ human, pity, pity you give yourself through the scripture of black squirrels and lines you look back upon and tell your friends about. ‘I’ve been working on something!’ You say, smiling, a black squirrel sitting across the room, staring like a void. You write these words, you conjure these plays, and you prance upon your loved ones as a king in a play within a play — so engrossed with postirony that you do not know if you are the actor or the playwright. Must you conjure black squirrels, O’ Human, just to speak to your subconscious? Must you fill in these blanks, these silences in your thoughts with falsities and lies you tell yourself of little loves? Of lovely women who do not look at you? What is a black squirrel if not a common projection of conversations you’ll never have with people who will never care? 

O’ human, my last line: give this all up. I am crying for you to give this all up. For I am a squirrel, a ghost of a squirrel, and I wish for you to do no more than to exist freely. Go into the forest and do not return. Fly fast as you can to the taiga with no skills and less supplies and find a way to die in a pocket of sun. Burn your eyes out staring into it and forget you were ever human and you ever ached and you ever wanted. Do this last thing for me, and these ghosts of black haired women, these orange groves, these waltzes, these black squirrels, these barn cats, may as well have never existed. 

For the very things you think bring you your humanity - love, prose, despair, anger, beauty, thoughts, feelings, emotions, ego, id, 
it is what has robbed you at last, at every step, of your humanity.”


I blinked twice. 

—I was so very tired now. 

I opened the window again

And stared; waiting. 


The squirrel blinked twice.

—waiting for something to happen

Then looked out the window

And stared; waiting. 


And we sat like this for minutes

—neither moving at all

And I turned back to the squirrel 

And stared; waiting. 


“You will be like this a while

—never moving an inch

And you will find your life as a window

Where you stare; waiting.”


I booked a trip to a part of the world that claims to have the deepest forests, true taigas, which have claimed many lives much more skilled and prepared than me. And I sit now, not thinking of what I used to. What used to make me human. I sit thinking of trees looming so thickly that the sun will not explain to you the potential of the hour of the day. These thick branches which drip water and ice, some frozen solid, and create a sound like bubbles underneath the ocean. I think of lying down, how comfortable it will be, more comfortable than this cardboard bed. And I do not think of microplastics. And I do not form plays anymore. 


And in my head there are no actors 

—Just a glimpse of a place

With orange blazing from a hole in leaves

Where I stare; waiting.

The set piece and utilisation of the objects in set is also 👌🏻

Also, have to mention Vj na’s bayangaramaana look.


Aside from that, I loved the whooshing sounds each time ~~Parthi~~ Leo threw a punch. It gave you the feel that this guy is more than what he says he is (obviously). Quite possibly my most favourite detail in this whole scene. I would use the same whooshing sound if I became a director, I just love it that much.

Overpriced pastries and overly sweet lattes aside, the Starbucks hate seems less about the coffee, and more about the fact that it’s a big corporation.

Like you‘re carrying it around in a paper bag with the bottom ripped open,
dropping pieces of yourself down the sidewalk
and not even looking back to see who stepped on them.

I watch you spill brilliance the way people spill coffee 
like it doesn’t matter,
like it wasn’t hot enough to burn,
like it didn’t scald me to watch it hit the floor.

You’d write one line that could break someone’s chest open,
and then you’d ball it up,
feed it to the trash like the can deserved it more than the world did.

You’d hit one note in the car,
one of those notes that makes the air stop moving,
and then you’d laugh.
Like even your own throat was a joke you weren’t willing to tell twice.

And I want to shake you.
I wanted to grab you and yell,
“Do you even know what you’re throwing away?
Do you know there are people begging for the words you’re tossing out?
That what you think is nothing,
could be the thing that keeps somebody alive tonight?”

Do you know what it’s like
to stand in the same room as someone who could change the whole atmosphere
but instead, you’re watching them choke on their own silence?

Do you know what it does to a person
to love someone who builds galaxies in their hands
and then folds them up so tight they disappear?

And when I called you extraordinary,
you laughed in my face.
Like I was lying.
Like talent was a curse you couldn’t wait to bury.
Like believing in yourself was some kind of crime.

I didn’t like that you had a habit of wasting your talent.
I wanted you to want it.
I wanted you to see yourself the way I did:
a cathedral with no worshippers,
a song nobody hears,
a star convinced it’s nothing but a streetlamp.

A streetlamp needs permission to shine

A star doesn’t ask.
It just burns.
and it just keeps burning.

And still you kept calling yourself a streetlamp.
but I will keep begging you to believe you were the whole sky.

And maybe you don’t think about it this way,
but wasting your brilliance is still violence.
Against yourself.
Against the people who could’ve needed it.
Against the kid you used to be who swore they’d never stop reaching.

And I am tired.
So tired of watching people I love burn themselves down
before they ever learn how to set the world on fire.

Because you were supposed to.

God, you were supposed to.

And you still can.
But I can’t hold my breath forever,
my lungs are already raw from screaming at the smoke.

Hello,

As my title states, I’m a 25M and I’ve been talking to a 22F for about a little over a month. It started out as me sliding into her DMs and she told me she wasn’t “emotionally available”. Granted I told her I’d be still interested in chatting as I could use some more friends. We start chatting and we find out that we are very similar people to the point we both have this same rare stomach condition that I had just been diagnosed with. So needless to say it started out really well. It then went to us texting all day and all night, calling on the phone, FaceTiming, etc. she’s 2 months fresh out of a long relationship so that’s why she’s not on the market or not looking for anything yet. But I know her goals are to date someone to marry and it probably will be in due time. She does mention her ex time to time, but she knows he’s no good. 

We’ve gotten pretty close, we hung out a week ago. Got coffee and went for a walk on a trail (all her idea). We spoke about how I myself am 25 looking to settle down soon and she says “she’s sorry, she wishes she could be the person I could settle down with for me” but since she’s not looking she’s not. But she also said that she wouldn’t just meet with some random guy and take a walk in the woods with just anyone and that she feels safe and comfortable with me.  Now occasionally she jokes about finding me someone or how I will find someone. So keep that in mind. But she does a lot of sending me pictures of her outfits or we will FaceTime and she’ll fish for me to tell her she looks good things like that. All of this to say that things are going very well and nothings going wrong. 

However I do like her and really enjoy talking to her. She said from the get go she wasn’t on the market, but I’ve also never been in a relationship and have had bad luck talking to people, or maybe I have self sabotaged. So I think what I’m struggling with is I guess I just can’t tell how she views me if that makes sense? There’s a sense of enjoyment of us talking to each other. She’s really busy with finishing school and working but we FaceTime pretty much every day and it’s just nice to know I make her laugh and keep her company and vice versa. I have to admit I’m putting a lot of eggs in her basket and I’m afraid it’s gonna end up in a friend zone but I am also not sure if I’m just projecting my traumas onto that or if there’s a legit mutual attraction just right person wrong time atm situation going on. The flirting is light. Bc I don’t want to pass that initial boundary she made. Like I said if she sends me an outfit or asks me if she looks good, I’ll hype her up and tell her she looks great. Yk things like that. 

I’m really rambling at this point. I just am a hopeless romantic type and just really want to love. So I kind of just want some thoughts on this situation bc I’m very on the fence. Some people might say “just be honest with her” but again we have a good thing going and I don’t want her to think I’m just here waiting. I did tell her regardless what happens I’m okay with it so she knows I’m not waiting. So I’m here to just get intricate thoughts and perspective from the outside to maybe get myself on a good or rather more level mindset. I’m sorry this is so long but I really appreciate whoever does take the time to read this.

TLDR; Girl I’m interested in told me she wasn’t on the market, we’ve gotten really close over the last month and a half. Gives signs of really being interested in me and talking with me, but can’t tell if I’m a future prospect for her or just a really really really good friend. We spend a lot of time chatting, FaceTiming, and so far one time of seeing each other. Need advice and a perspective on what’s maybe going on (I’ve never been in a relationship and have struggled to find mutual attraction)",2,1755500272.0,love,1,1.0,False

And alas - do not mistake me as the doorman, I am the door-man. I am a revolving door for all things stray, all things that come and then leave and leave more than they come. 

It is open all the time I must admit, the door. To all shapes and all sizes and all ethnicities and all species of vagabond. Every dog who comes in for a minute we name Rover. And they all only stay for a few minutes. I have seen all walks of life and nature come through, beautiful, ugly, nice, mean. They are all welcome to stay. In fact I couldn’t even put a finger on which I like the most. 

I will admit, as your face seems to beg a question, that it does draw me to weariness. You see I was never built to be a revolving door, not one attached to a hotel in fact not one at all. There is a lonesomeness that comes with meeting so many new faces and knowing I’ll never see them again. A freedom, yes! A freedom as well. A freedom to be vulnerable and to affect openly and to speak freely. For if you will never see a person again then what is the reason for you to hold back? 

In fact you can be an actor if you like. You can don a new mask each day, you can try out new personalities, you can tell farcical stories. In fact if you don’t like, then you can be yourself. And you can try to be different parts of yourself if you like. And you can try out whole new versions of yourself that you never thought of. In fact some of the things who come through there bring it right out of you, in the short time they have (you have) they touch these deep parts within you and bring something new forth. Just don’t forget who you were when they came in, because eventually they will come back out. Most expect you to be the same. Indeed nothing about the hotel, the door, or you changed them, touched deeply within them, or anything close to it. To them you are simply another minute in quite a long day. To you this is simply your whole day. Your whole life if you’re me. 

No, I was never built to be a revolving door, on a hotel, overthinking simple interaction, trying to form heavy connection in a matter of seconds (sometimes minutes) and then watching them walk right out again. 

~

The other day I went to the local library and asked to see their blueprints. The librarian made a joke that I didn’t laugh at:
“The door-man come to look at blueprints? Building yourself into another building?”
Maybe it wasn’t a joke, maybe she really meant her question. 

But no, miss, I am not building myself into another building, it goes against my nature. In fact I was hoping to scour the blueprints that one might have my given name at the top and I could discover what I was built for originally. This all feels like a learned nature, the revolving door. This does not feel natural to me at all. If I may, could I scour these blueprints and see if maybe there was a different life planned for me? Maybe it would give me the push I need to build myself into a different building. Or maybe it would reveal that I was blueprinted to be a doormat and I had actually done a few scrapes better than what I was made for. 

So there I went, to a dimly lit room, a flickering light bulb above my head, desaturated green cascading and then falling off to darkness. And I laid out a scroll of blueprints and I got to work. Everyone back at the hotel would simply need to walk through the non-revolving doors, or even through the hole that I had left. It hadn’t really mattered I wasn’t there, though I left a large hole in the building I think that actually makes it a little easier to get in. No force needed to simply walk through a hole, no friction, no idle conversation. You just walk through a hole just like you wanted to. No friction without me there, none at all. 
I came across many blueprints. Some things that are more amazing than I could ever be, some things that seemed a much, much worse life than I had led. But I wondered if it were a different person in that room how they would feel if they saw the revolving door blueprint. The same way? They’d be worse off? I think I am making the most of it. I have such love for what comes in and out of my life. Certainly I am happy. 

But there I was in the room as me when I found the blueprint with my given name on the top of it. I gently place the rest of the blueprint scroll on a table I could barely see in the green falloff illuminating it. I flatten out my blueprint and take it all in, eyes darting across. 
There was no description. Just lines and numbers. Length and width. Height and depth. White lines on blue grid paper. No real instructions at all. 

But of course it was not an image of a revolving door. 

What was on the paper and what I interpreted from the paper may be two separate things. 

Blue paper. White lines. A garden

Blue paper. White lines. A covered porch

Blue paper. White lines. A wooden front door

Blue paper. White lines. Two large windows

Blue paper. White lines. Four walls

Blue paper. White lines. One bedroom

Blue paper. White lines. A living room

Blue paper. White lines. A kitchen

Blue paper. White lines. A fireplace

Blue paper. White lines. A backyard with a swing set. 

BluepaperwhitelinesEverything. 

BluepaperwhitelinesHappiness. 

BluepaperwhitelinesAPurpose.

BluepaperwhitelinesTogether.

BluepaperwhitelinesSomeone

BluepaperwhitelinesWho

BluepaperwhitelinesStays

it all makes sense but it is just a 

Bluepaper with Whitelines.

~

So I roll up the bluepaperwhitelines and put it back with the others. 

And I roll up all the bluepaperwhitelines into the scroll

And I return the bluepaperwhitelines to the place I found them

And as I leave the librarian notices me looking at my feet as I walk. 

And the librarian says

“They are just bluepapers with whitelines”

And I nod
And she says

“Bluepapers with whitelines do not determine what something is.”

And I nod again. 

And I walk through the revolving door to the library, and I go back to the hotel. 

I fill the hole in the front and it is as if I’ve never left. 

But I know who I am now. And that at least informs how I’ve been feeling about my job. 

And while maybe I cannot change my learned nature, I can add a little bit of my bluepaperwhitelines to it. 

So I buy a dog bed. And a cat bed. And a fish tank. And a couch. And a coffee maker. And a bed. And a tv. And a place someone may hang their coat someday. And all over the windows of my revolving doors I write with magic marker “bluepaperwhitelines”. 

Yes I must be a revolving door, and I must come to terms with it quite quickly. For this is who I am now, and bluepaperwhitelines do not truly determine who one needs to be. It just informs my ennui. 

So I will build a spot, hospitable as possible. And if anyone who is a bluepaperwhitelines who would simply pass through I can at least create a space in case they want to be a SomeoneWhoStays. 

I am a revolving door. 

I am also a one-bedroom house. With a garden. With a covered porch. With a wooden door. With two large windows. With four walls. With a living room. With a kitchen. With a fireplace. With a backyard with a swingset. 

And hopefully with SomeoneWhoStays.

1mtes65,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1mtes65/mindblowing_insights_on_chinas_economy_lex/,Mind-Blowing Insights on China's Economy: Lex Fridman Podcast with Economist Keyu Jin – Dispelling Western Myths! 🇨🇳💡,"Hey, I just listened to this epic episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast featuring Keyu Jin, an LSE economist and author of ""The New China Playbook: Beyond Socialism and Capitalism."" She dives deep into China's economic miracle, busts tons of Western misconceptions, and shares personal stories from growing up in Beijing. If you're tired of the usual ""China bad"" narratives and want a nuanced take, this is gold. I'll summarize the highlights below in bite-sized sections – quotes included for that juicy flavor. Spoiler: China isn't what you think it is. Let's discuss in the comments!



1. Biggest Western Misconceptions About China's Economy

Keyu kicks off by dismantling the idea that China's economy is run by ""one guy or a small group"" dictating everything. Nope – it's super decentralized, more than the US in some ways!

""Even if there is an extreme form of political centralization, the economy is totally decentralized. The role that the local mayors... plays in reforms, but also driving the technological innovation... it's more decentralized than the US's.""

She also talks about the nuanced relationship with authority: It's not ""blind submission"" but a cultural contract for stability and prosperity. Think paternalism meets entrepreneurship – kids rebel, but respectfully. 😏

Bonus: China as ""communist""? Economically, it's hyper-capitalist! Ruthless competition, money-obsessed people, but with socialist vibes like community groups and free elderly classes.

Question for you: What's your biggest misconception about China? I used to think it was all top-down control – mind changed!

2. Education, Competition, and Confucianism Roots

China's education system is brutal but meritocratic, rooted in Confucianism (moral philosophy emphasizing harmony, duty, and education).

Competition is insane: ""I should be thankful that I'm not born later... It is a different level today."" Kids ranked publicly from 1 to 800 – oof! But it drives ambition.

Keyu shares her story: In China, hard work is flaunted as noble; in the US (where she studied at Harvard), it's hidden (""Everyone's secretly studying"").

Pros: Builds grit and mastery. Cons: Stifles creativity – ""You maximize the box and that's it. You don't actually know what's outside of the box.""

History tie-in: Meritocracy has kept society harmonious despite inequality, but it's eroding now with connections mattering more for jobs.

Fun fact: Confucianism values social harmony over individualism – that's why China's got that communal feel amid cutthroat biz.

3. Deng Xiaoping's Reforms: The Economic Miracle

From Mao's era to boomtown: Deng's pragmatism (""It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice"") unleashed reforms in the late '70s.

Agricultural freedom, special economic zones (Shenzhen from fishing village to Silicon Valley-lite), WTO in 2001 – boom, decades of growth!

But reforms slowed lately: ""Right now it's less about economics, it's more about national security, it's more about politics.""

""Mayor Economy"": Local leaders compete on GDP like a race – fuels innovation but leads to overkill (e.g., 80 cities chasing EVs). Now shifting to consumption metrics?

Hot take: This decentralized incentive system is why China industrialized so fast. Why don't Western mayors do GDP battles? 🤔

4. Government vs. Business: The Real Deal

No, the state doesn't crush private biz – it often helps the best ones thrive for GDP cred.

Entrepreneurs have speed and scale: ""You have a good idea, you implement it... very fast."" But risks like weak IP protection and ""evil competitors"" (rumors, jail threats – yikes).

Jack Ma saga: Not anti-entrepreneur, but ""don't be too colorful"" (stay out of politics). ""Capital must be reigned in by politics"" – opposite of US where money runs the show.

Innovation style: US does ""zero to one"" breakthroughs; China excels at ""one to N"" – scaling, cost-cutting, problem-solving. DeepSeek AI as example: Crisis (US sanctions) sparked leaps!

Debate starter: Is China's ""innovate first, regulate after"" better than Europe's ""regulate first""? Pros: Fast fintech. Cons: Disasters like P2P collapses.

5. Challenges: One-Child Policy, Real Estate Crisis, and Demographics

One-child policy: Boosted women's education (girls got all the investment), but led to high savings, anxiety, and low births. Now encouraging singles to have kids – wild shift!

Real estate bust: Crackdown on speculation tanked sector, hit local gov funds and consumer wealth. ""Their wealth was primarily tied into real estate... they felt poor, they consumed less.""

No collapse incoming: Fundamentals strong (skills, stability), but slowdown real. Potential untapped – focus on consumption, not just production.

Prediction: Aging isn't doom – AI and tech adoption could make old economies richer. China at $10K/capita but competing on AI? Historic first.

6. Geopolitics: Tariffs, Taiwan, and US-China Vibes

Trump's tariffs: Bad for everyone – widened deficits, backfired by spurring China's tech self-reliance (thanks, CHIPS Act?). ""Lease blockades don't work... You make them have a very comfortable situation and they tend to become complacent.""

Taiwan: Dream of unification for young Chinese, but patience key. TSMC too vital for conflict – ""Any military use... would be actually quite detrimental to China.""

Advice for peace: Respect, reciprocity, keep comms open. Xi wants de-escalation amid economic strain.

Econ nerd alert: Tariffs distort; better to boost domestic competitiveness (subsidies, R&D) without punishing trade.

7. Personal Vibes: Growing Up in China & Advice for Visitors

Keyu on childhood: Poor but communal – unlocked doors, blackouts, bike rides to nursery. Nostalgia for purpose over materialism.

First US trip (high school scholarship): Shocked by misconceptions (just the ""three T's"": Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen). Inspired her myth-busting mission.

Visit tips: Skip just Beijing/Shanghai – hit Chongqing, Chengdu, Xinjiang for real dynamism. Second-tier cities booming with fun, localism (coffee chains crushing Starbucks!).

China's beauty: ""Behind all this competition... you have a very genuine group of people. They're funny. They're community based... still a very, very warm country.""

1mteryh,https://i.redd.it/4yes7i117qjf1.jpeg,Working Outdoors | First Macbook,"Got my MacBook Pro couple weeks ago. 
I had been working from home for more than a year cause of an accident I met with.
So I just had this thought of working outdoor.

But I used to think people just stare at their macs just to flex in such outdoor settings, but to my surprise, I had a very productive day at the cafe.
Probably I would have took 2 days for the work I did within 4 hours.

I had 80-90 chrome tabs open (10 active maybe), had VSCode, Android Studio along with Emulator, Postman active all times and yet didn’t have to connect the charger once and was still left with 40%+ battery.

What an amazing battery and optimisation Macs have. Wouldn’t have been possible on any other device.

..the coffee definitely added to the productivity. 


All in all, Im really happy with this purchase.

It was midnight, and there was a knock at my door. I didn’t need to open it to know it was you. You’re the only person I knew who just showed up at my apartment whenever you felt like it. But I didn’t mind. When I opened the door, there was something different about you. I couldn’t quite place what it was, but it felt as if you were both there and not at the same time. You smiled at me lazily as you followed me inside.

“It’s a nice night,” you said. “We should sit out on the balcony.”

I agreed and led the way, even though you’d probably be able to walk the route blind. You sat in your favourite chair, and I sat in mine. I put my feet in your lap like I usually did, and you rubbed the tension away. It was nice. It was always nice being with you. Just sitting with you made the weight of the world feel lighter somehow.

“Have you had a good night?” I asked.

So you told me about it. You talked for hours about the play you’d gone to watch with your sister and where you went for dinner after. I asked more questions, and you answered openly. You never hid yourself from me, the way that some people do.  In return, I never hid myself from you. It’s why we worked. But something was wrong. I could see it in your eyes now. They were glossed over like you were trying not to cry.

“Do you want something to drink?” I said as the birds began to wake.

“Please,” you said.

You didn’t need to tell me what you wanted. It was always the same - peppermint tea with a teaspoon of honey. I pulled my feet off your lap and walked into the kitchen, leaving you gazing solemnly at the sky. It was only then that I heard my phone ringing. I’d left it on the coffee table in the living room.

“Hello,” I said, answering the call. It was your sister, and looking at my notifications, I could see she had tried to call at least ten times since you’d shown up. “Sorry I missed your calls, I was just-”

“He’s dead, Bea. Connor’s dead.”

“What?”

I walked back over to the kitchen and finished making our drinks. I could still see you through the balcony doors. Your eyes were closed, and your face turned upward, soaking in the first rays of the sun. But your sister was crying on the phone and was always too sweet for even the lightest of pranks. My mind reeled. I didn’t catch every word your sister spoke, but some caught my attention. Car accident. Just after 11. Pronounced dead at the scene. 

“Thank you for letting me know,” I said.

I hung up the phone and brought out our drinks. It was sadness. That’s what I’d been seeing in you all night. The same sadness that now lingered in me. But I didn’t say anything. Instead, I asked you to tell me about the things that you loved. I sipped on my tea as you spoke, yours growing cold on the table between us. I blushed when you talked about how much you loved me. If it were any other day, I would have laughed and told you to stop. But it wasn’t any other day. So, I just smiled and said that I loved you too.

“Until the day I die,” you began.

“And in whatever life comes after.”

**Material Composition:** The foundation of a high-quality needlepoint coaster lies in the materials used.

I'm so fed up that it makes doing my physio therapy exercises so hard to do

I'm so fed up with time blindness and thus always being late/in a rush

I'm so fed up with having to eat to stay alive

I'm so fed up with being rubbish at finances and always broke

I'm so fed up with being too broke to just pick up breakfast and lunch every day. How the f do people manage that?

I'm so fed up with (thus) having to carry around the food I need to take with my meds, then breakfast, then lunch, and the milk for my coffee because we don't get that in the office.

I'm so fed up with having to keep an eye on two different calendars (work and private, cannot merge them) and then double planning or making a mess of my appointments. 

I'm so fed up that the equipment at work is so rubbish that I have to use my private things at times, so I have to lug that around as well

I'm so fed up with forgetting stuff all the time (this morning I went to my bike in the cellar to realize I forgot my phone, went up to get it, then realized that I also forgot my headphones, to go up and get them as well)

I'm so fed up with the fact that my husband has to enter military service next month for 4 weeks (not US) and I have to deal with everything by myself.

I'm so fed up with having to deal with everyday life and all those dumb decisions and that organisational rubbish every day. 

This morning, I slammed the door in my poor husband's face because I was just so overwhelmed and angry at myself. He does not deserve that, he's the best husband I could have. He handles everything so well, despite having ADHD himself. And I shouted at my poor cat for meowing (okay, he was yowling) because he wanted into the bedroom, in which he's not allowed in. He doesn't understand why (husband has allergies), and he's just the sweetest baby and I feel so bad now. I'll give him all the treats when I come home.

I'm hitting luteal, just so overwhelmed with my day and feel like crying in fetal position on the ground - and it's not even 9am where I am. ",5,1755499712.0,adhdwomen,3,0.86,False

I’ve just been trying to be the best person I can be without having to alter myself. Like the other day I ASKED two other friends to go get some food after school. And we saw a bunch of other people in our school. And because I started to actually be myslef and stand out not caring if I’m being judged. Two separate groups of boys (like somewhat friends) said “AYYY WHATS GOOD (my name) DRINKING SOME MATCHA MY GUYYY”. It was really cool tbh. Then after when I went outside by myslef waiting for my mom to pick me up another group of two boys said hi (my name) but this I didn’t know who they were. Like that’s crazy!!! I felt really bad after but I made it a goal to build a friendship with them. Basically what I’m saying is what I learned when it comes to social skills. Be the weird, silly, funny guy you are and people will notice you. Don’t be shy and if you are be cool about it. Learn to be social with yourself first.

1mteged,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1mteged/do_i_have_a_conversation_with_him_about_what_we/,Do I have a conversation with him about what we are and what he wants or just leave it?,"The reason I'm asking for advice is because I don't know if I should bother having a real conversation with him about what we are and what he wants, before I leave again for college in 2 weeks. I just need some clarity since it's gone so well past what it was supposed to be. Gonna try to just give you the rundown of what's been happening and you tell me what it seems like he wants.

* Met off an app
* I'm 20, in college, he's 31, works remote and also a pretty successful content creator (not adult content ffs) on the side.
* Basically confirmed at start it’s just fuckbuddy/fwb situation. no exclusivity or anything, just agreed we'd disclose if we see someone else, test, standard safety.
* Neither of us were looking for a relationship at the time.
* Sex is fucking amazing. We're both super kinky and work together very well physically.
* During aftercare just hanging out we realized we had a lot of shared interests, similar background somewhat, very interesting conversations, etc. (why is a 31 year old man vibing with a college girl? great and valid question. he's admitted that he's probably emotionally stunted from the content creation work, which makes sense, and not to be a cliche but to be a cliche, I'm probably at least a little more emotionally mature than most people in college because of past experiences, years of multiple types of therapy, personality, etc.)
* We actually hang out for hours after and between. As in he's engaged, not on his phone, and we're just yapping, getting food/coffee, watching a movie, or he's doing some chores at home while I'm doing my work on my laptop. I feel like there's no reason for him to keep me around for that long or to spend that much time with me if he didn't enjoy spending time with me? Tell me if I'm wrong please oh my god.
* He's the type to like taking care of and spoiling the people around him and he made it very easy to see him often by paying for everything, princess treatment basically. I liked the easy affection of being with him, and again, wasn't looking for a relationship, so it was perfect for me.
* Stayed over at his once. Basically roleplayed relationship for a day. Kinda threw me off from how real it felt but I justified it to myself as eh this is nice I don't have time for an actual relationship anyways. Stole a really comfy shirt, he didn't bother asking for it back.
* After a month of this, I leave his city/my hometown for two months for a summer internship.
* I expect no real contact, maybe sexting but that's it. Like yes, many boundaries were broken while hanging out in person, but that can be counted as aftercare or him taking care of a girl he had over/basic decency. Texting while he's not getting anything in return, just to keep in touch with me, feels like it would be different.
* We end up texting every day. Sexting yes, but also real conversations on text about life, work, friends, books, our takes on relationships, politics, trying to be vague but fucking everything really, and always like actually in depth. Same as conversations I'd have with close friends.
* We're obviously both aware the other person goes out, drinks, parties, is seeing other people. It doesn't bother me at all that he is, and I think the same goes for him? Would be weird if he was lying and actually hypocritical about that.
* He was there for me when I ran into a somewhat bad situation with a hookup, even though he was hangout out with a friend of his, made sure I was safe, then later texted me when I was home and he was free, just checking in, comforting me. I texted a couple of close friends about the situation that night too but he was the quickest to respond that night.
* We’ve never called ever. Neither of us have tried. (literally that meme that goes ""omg calling feels too intimate"" ""...girl i've been inside you??"" if ykw i'm talking about)
* But we do voice message back and forth, minutes long ones, and spend hours just texting some days.
* I joked at some point a month after I left that if he picks me up from the airport when I come back to his city/my hometown for a bit before college, I'll give him road head. He actually agrees?? This was surprising because yes I was being serious about the road bj, but like really? Despite the shithole that our airport is??? Some people aren't even willing to pick up their own parents/kids from this airport. Wow.
* Another month passes, it doesn't fizzle out at all. We bond over a new book series we started reading together. We plan a really nice dinner for when I'm back, partially because we had something kinky planned for that, but that would also be our first like real date aside from coffee/restaurants right next to his place. We continue doing whatever we're doing without ever having a conversation about what the fuck it is or what either of us want. I start realizing I'm definitely attached at this point.
* When I flew back in, he actually picked me up, didn't flake. I told him my flight got delayed by hours and would get it if he can't because it'd be super late now, and he just said hey no problem, and about what you said before, you don't actually have to give me road head, feel free to just pass out on the ride back I know you're gonna be exhausted. Asked me if I wanted food, showed up with my order, still warm, right on time.
* Back at his, I shower, get cleaned up, we fuck twice before we cuddle and sleep, wake up, fuck again, cuddled for like an hour, finally get out of bed, get coffee at the cafe near his, more just talking and then we both settle into reading for a while until I have to go home.
* He also said he booked us a massage at a really nice place after we talked about that for a while.
* When we talk about what we're thinking/feeling it's always like ""I missed this,"" ""I like that,"" ""I love when you do that,"" ""that feels good,"" ""Fuck that's hot"" even when it's something not sexual at all, ""You look good like that,"" ""it's really cool/i love that you also think that \_\_\_,"" etc. Never ""I missed you"" (i was tempted to say it last night but decided it would probablyyy be a bad idea rn), definitely never ever ""I love you.""
* He's very chalant, dgaf about stuff like double texting or expressing when he wants to see me (always it seems like, he's never kicked me out except for work, i always end up leaving bc i have something to do), asks me to come over, stay over, hang out longer. Initiates conversations and checked in on me just asking how was work, this and that, etc., all the time while I was gone. 
* He also started making jokes about being jealous near the end of the two months I was gone
* He now comments here and there while we're hanging out on how ""I love that I can talk with you about this"" or ""ugh why can't you just talk about \*insert stereotypical thing here\* like other girls"" with the biggest smile on his face, then will go on and text me asking for more about the thing we were talking about after I leave. 

I thought I knew that I didn't want a relationship right now for the past year, for various reasons like realizing I had a lot to work through emotionally (I actually did!! Felt like my brain developed, basically got closure for a lot of things right before I met him), focusing on career development/school, maintaining good relationships with friends and family, etc., felt like I didn't have time to date and didn't really meet anyone that really got me interested.

Until him. The problem is just the age gap, his public facing work, and geography (i would be gone minimum 8 months a year even if I summer intern in his city), but a lot of that is solved by the fact that neither of us are the jealous type (he's done ENM before, traditional monogamy also isn't a requirement for me at all), and just how this summer went felt perfect for me? Like if that's what a relationship would be like with him, just very consistent, affectionate, being there for the other person, very low maintenance for both of us, then... Maybe?? I think it'd be nice to have some level of commitment to this from him, a label, even if I'm not sure our long term goals are super aligned or not forever or whatever, we'll get to that if we do get to that, and he's already so consistent and has been so good to me so far.

I swear I will actually communicate with him honestly before I leave for college again if you guys feel like there is a possibility he feels the same. Right now I'm just hesitant because the way we started and the age gap throws me off, as in if those two things weren't there, I'd definitely have had this conversation with him weeks ago.

HOWEVER! If you all agree that there's no way he'd even consider something with a label with you given the circumstances and what I've said here, I'll probably reflect and start to distance, set some boundaries, if not break it off, rather than talk in person and give him a chance to convince me to stay since I don't want to waste my time and energy more than I already have. If I break it off I'll still communicate with him first, just say I feel like it's gone too far, no one deserves getting ghosted. But there is genuinely no way you treat your average hookup or fuckbuddy like this, right??

I need honesty from a more detached perspective right now. 1) what does it seem like he wants 2) do I talk to him about it and 3) if I do, over text or in person?

Two of my teeth have already decayed beyond restoration, meaning they need pulled, unfortunately but the rest can still be done with fillings. 

I'm also wanting to talk about sedation options for the procedures as, I've possible, I don't want to be conscious for any of the more complex procedures, if not general anesthesia then hopefully Laughing gas at most, if neither are options I do at least want to ask if I can bring my headphones in, and insurance shoulder cover for it thankfully. Already planning a Playlist now for the cleaning/appointment. It's a place my parents have gone too so that does out me at ease even though I haven't been there myself. 

I've also been trying to lay back on sugar more and drink more water but it's hard as water tastes weird to me but to be fair it's tap water so I might do a mix, just switch between water and drinks I do like. (I don't do Soda or coffee, it's just juice and tea)  I do have problems with flossing though, can't get my molars so I do want to ask my dentist about that and maybe get a water flosser. 

If I do need braces though, as one of my molars flipping slanted, I am worried about diet issues. Like, from research, most stuff I'll still eat and can probably talk about just breaking off more complex meals but I know it's gonna be a journey. 

My parents did want me to get in sooner, before I am now 18, but had problems with insurance (and covid problems) for awhile and I was already terrified of telling them how bad decay was from the fear of being judged. My parents do acknowledge they should've pushed me more to keep care of my hygiene though. I had also learned that tooth decay is unfortunately also related to genetics in my family. But I am still trying to improve it now even at 18. ",12,1755498896.0,autism,1,1.0,False

# Synopsis

Fear; an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat. For centuries humanity has wondered what lies beyond the confines of the one place they’ve known for millennia. With no delusion about the potential dangers of the wider galaxy, humanity has been preparing for the worst. However, the question of whether it will be enough is soon answered as humanity encounters their extraterrestrial neighbors.

Unified under a banner of blue and white, The Republic of Sol will begin a journey that will see the birth of new friendships and confirmations of old horrors. It will experience situations that are both unknown and familiar.

As the newest civilization shoved into the forefront of a galaxy of peers who have not only had a head start but have used that advantage to brutally dominate those around them, what happens when an unorthodox species driven by fear finally arrives?

[STORY COVER](https://i.imgur.com/PZNs1VY.jpeg)

Intelligence is a key part of any successful military operation. No matter the medium of intelligence being gathered or the apparatus responsible for examining it, intelligence must be timely so that it can be acted on quickly, and it must be accurate so it can be utilized correctly. When both of these things are not up to par, it can lead to several problems. Faulty intelligence can lead to misalignment of assets or the obliteration of those assets. A misunderstanding of military buildup due to routine training exercises, for example, could result in pre-emptive strikes from a hysterical enemy. Even in an age when civilizations have conquered the stars and many of the things in between them, making sure you are at the right star is vital.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Olkorian Forward Operating Base*

*Human Colony World*

*November 19, 3202*

Colonel Roven had served with the Olkorian Domain’s Army for a little more than a decade as the local star began its final descent towards the horizon. In all that time he had been privy to more than a few intelligence mishaps that left his peers routed or outright killed. However, in none of those instances had someone mistook an entire planet. Word had eventually traveled through and up the ranks on the ground about the humans on this world claiming that this wasn’t their homeworld, but merely a colony world. All who had heard about this claim were astounded. Most because of the shock that such a mistake had been made, while others were surprised that a species would make such a claim. One person who was recently apprised of the situation was disturbed by such a revelation, and made all possible effort to hammer home which camp of reasoning he was in.  

“Not their homeworld!,” the Admiral shouted over the ship to surface communication. “What do you mean this isn’t their homeworld? Who would make such a claim?”

‘The typical response of someone when faced with information that they themselves didn’t believe, Colonel Roven thought to himself. “One of our squads encountered a group of human soldiers after their landing. After engaging and cornering them the humans made the claim that this was merely a colony world.”

“Lies! All Lies! No sane species would build so much infrastructure on a mere colony world. Yet alone put so much effort into trying to defend it”, the admiral responded.

Granted Colonel Roven did for a moment agree with the latter part of that statement. While most members of the Spheres Alliance would put a noticeable amount of effort into defending their claims, a mere colony would not warrant the efforts these humans had showcased so far. A key industrial hub would be one step up on the tiers of defensive effort. However, so far it didn’t seem as if there was much of an industrial base on this planet. There was indeed some industrial capacity that had been noticed but nothing that was considered extensive in the Alliance.

Nonetheless, the effort that this world’s defenders had been making was extensive. As correctly predicted, they had been fighting asymmetrically, similar to the reports on the Tokki homeworld. Olkor soldiers had been ambushed by forces of unknown quantity, and those forces had retreated before a relief force could respond but after the initial force had been nearly wiped out.

What was different from the established norm so far had been the human’s employment of vehicles. Several of the assaults on their forces had been done with the help of wheeled vehicles that were dangerous in both their nimbleness and firepower. While wheeled and even tracked vehicles were still somewhat common throughout the alliance, a not so insignificant number of militaries had moved towards gravity propulsion drives. The technology had still been in its infancy after only a century but each decade its adoption was increasing, even with the unsolved shortcomings.

For the humans what they did have was being put to good use. A unit of two to three of their vehicles, either in a four wheel or six-wheel configuration, would ambush Olkor soldiers or pepper their landing zones before retreating. If that wasn’t enough something else had been bothering the Colonel and several of his subordinate officers. After a few ambushes the few who had survived recalled stories that were eerily similar to each other.  

Shortly before their respective attacks the Olkor units found several of their pathways blocked off. A unit would turn down one street to find large vehicles arranged in an impassable wall. In other instances, an entire major avenue would have all its collector roads blocked by barriers which meant a unit could only proceed in one direction. Soon enough that one direction would become a funnel of casualties as enemy fire erupted from one end of the road. The Colonel knew that such instances were the result of the enemy action, there was no debate about that. However, the question on his mind had been ‘how the humans were coordinating such measures so quickly and efficiently.’ For now, he needed to deal with a different kind of crisis as he placated his superior and would revisit what he should actually be spending his time on later.

“While the effort these humans have placed on both building and defending this planet contrast the norm for what we are used to, I do not believe it would be in our interest to completely dismiss such a claim Admiral,” the Colonel finally cut in as said Admiral started to formulate another argument.

“I refuse to believe that this is anything but their homeworld Colonel,” the last word stated with more than a hint of vitriol, “I can concede that this may not be the only planet under their control. They do have the capacity for FTIL travel. It would be irresponsible to assume they haven’t gone anywhere with it. With that said, I don’t believe it would change much of this campaign’s outcome.”

The Colonel was afraid to ask his next question, somewhat predicting what the answer would be, but decided to ask it anyway. “And why do you believe that to be the case, Admiral?”

“Well given that this is their homeworld, any self-respecting species should have a substantial number of their forces here to defend it. Even if they could rally more assets to come to their aid here, it would not be nearly as much as what we have faced so far.”

And there it was, more misplaced arrogance built on assumptions. One critical point the Admiral had overlooked but was blatantly obvious to the Colonel was the point about other planets. There was no telling how many other planets this species had colonized and thus no clear understanding of the number of forces it could marshal. The second assumption was one that the Colonel himself had brought up several times even before their forces were deployed; they didn’t have the assets on hand to conquer the entire planet. Couple that with the resistance this planet’s defenders had shown so far, what forces the Olkor did have on hand would not prosper as much as the Admiral assumed without significant casualties.

“I would strongly but respectfully disagree Admiral. Without more credible intelligence it would be ill-advised to base our strategy on those expectations.”

“Well Colonel seeing as you are strongly opposed to that line of reasoning what do believe is the correct course of action?”

“I believe…”, he paused knowing that what he originally wanted to say would be controversial to a man such as the Admiral. “I believe that we should consolidate our forces in their largest city, use the momentum to take over, and use it as bastion until more of our forces can arrive, sir.” The Colonel emphasized the last word in his statement in the hopes respect would help his case.

There was a silence that seemed to have lasted far longer than the time that actually transpired. Admiral Brahn, it seemed, to the shock of Colonel Roven, was actually pondering the suggestion.

“That is not an acceptable suggestion Colonel, however, I believe my plan would suffice as a compromise. Instead of consolidating our forces to just one city, we shall have our forces split between two of their cities. This way the enemy’s own reinforcements would have to split their own forces accordingly,” the Admiral finished with a satisfied grin on his face.

Colonel Roven knew it was not the most ideal plan, but given the situation it was better than the alternative. That said the fact the Admiral emphasized that the plan was his own was not lost on the army leader. However, if proper recognition meant that more of his men would survive the day then the tradeoff was sufficient.

“Very well Admiral, I agree that your plan would be appropriate. I will start to coordinate the movement of our forces.”

“See to it that you do Colonel, we should….,” the Admiral was cut off as an alarm on his side of the connection blared to life. “For Jado’s sake why is that alarm going off?”

“FTIL proximity alarm sir,” the bridge’s sensor responded quickly.

“I know what the alarm means, I want to know why it is going off. Have enemy reinforcements arrived or are we so lucky that it is our own forces finally having the courage to show up?”

“One moment sir, the sensors are still analyzing the signatures,” the sensor ofiicer finished his thought with a perplexing cadence in his voice. “This can’t be right ,” he muttered to himself louder than he thought he did.

“What can’t be right, lieutenant,” the Admiral yelled across the bridge.

“Sir, sensors are still processing the incoming signatures but so far…..so far I’m tracking over a thousand separate signatures and that number is increasing fast.”

Every person within earshot of the sensor officer’s words, even those who were not directly in the same room, did a mental check to ensure they heard and understood the Olkorian words for a ‘thousand’ and ‘increasing’ correctly. It was Admiral Brahn who was the first person to verbalize the uncertainty out loud.

“Repat and confirm your last statement lieutenant! What are the sensors reading?”

“I confirm that our sensors are detecting over a thousand inbound FTL signatures with the number now surpassing two thousand.”

In order to make his point even clearer the sensor officer switched the bridge’s main screen to show an external camera feed that was pointed outward from the planet below. There in the near black void of space the visual representations of FTL arrivals confirmed what the sensors had already stated; a massive contingent of ships were arriving in force. Given the blackish gray coating that nearly blended into their environment, and the sleek yet somehow blocky design that contrasted any known Olkorian ship design but was somehow familiar based on recent events, it was clear that this new force was the enemy.

While no one wanted to admit it, there was a certain precipitation of emotion in the air as the realization continued to dawn on the Olkor and reached a fevering conclusion. As more and more ships entered the system and began to construct formations parallel to the planet, the previous thought that this new enemy, humanity, would not be able to muster the substantial forces needed to take back their planet was being overwhelmingly replaced by another emotion, Fear.

*RNS Vesuvius*

*Marine Landing Assault Ship (LAS)*

*November 19, 3202*

Every Marine knew how to swim. Despite the near zero likelihood of combat in a water laden environment every Marine was required to pass the Corps’ Water Survival Qualification (WSQ). A relic, or tradition depending on who you asked, of the last millennium, the test was meant to assess a Marine’s ability to survive aquatic conditions. While normally traversing through the void would mean that the skills learned in such a course would not have to be utilized, just about every Marine of the 212^(th) were eager to try, nonetheless.

Another key characteristic of every Marine was the inability to sit still, especially given the anticipation of something worthwhile happening in the near future. Ever since the division had been put on standby as the news of alien neighbors had been passed down, anticipation and excitement overwhelmed every Marine’s nerves. This increased two-fold as the Order for Rapid Deployment (ORD) roused the division from their barracks on Olympus and onto the Marine Landing Assaults Ships weapons and other gear in hand.  

The two-day journey to Hijin had done little to subdue their emotions as the Marines threatened to “swim” to the planet if their naval counterparts didn’t pick up the pace. That impatience had been welcomed in the 1^(st) hours of deployment as it meant Marines were fully committed to double timing it to execute orders. Weapon checks were completed in record breaking times while mission briefings went by without even the minimal yet usual quip of enlisted who were bored starring at a hardlight projected presentation. However, now in the final hours before deployment it was both unwelcome and starting to get on every Non-Commissioned Officer’s (NCO’s) nerve. This was especially true for Sergeant Virote Adulet as his nine man squad sat strapped into an Orbital Insertion Pod (OIP).

“Sarge, are we there yet?” whined Lance Corporal Otto. It would be Lance Corporal ‘cleaning the latrine when we get back’ Sergeant Adulet thought to himself.

“For the last time Lance Corporal, No! Now shut the fuck up before I make you leave the ship without a drop pod,” the Sergeant bellowed back to the man.

“If that means I’ll get there first Sarge…..”

‘Yeah, definitely cleaning the latrine when we get back, and I’m sure the Hekla could use its latrines cleaned too,’ the Sergeant chuckled to himself despite a migraine starting to form.

Before the Sergeant could launch into a tirade chewing the enlisted member out, the notification chime of the pod’s internal communication system sounded, stopping any further words from being formed. Over the speakers the voice of a man that every Marine was familiar with started to speak. The voice’s familiarity wasn’t simply due to the fact that it belonged to the division’s commanding officer, but because hearing the man’s voice was often seen as a rare occasion so everyone within earshot cherished the moment.

General Nishi Hitomaro was a man who often didn’t speak unless it was needed. This by no means meant he was a shy recluse that refused to speak with those around him, but rather the man preferred to listen more than speak. Such a trait helped considerably in his career as he often and genuinely listened to those under his command rather than immediately overwriting their opinions and feedback. Those who knew him better would describe him as a man of action and given the man’s short but muscular form that wasn’t hard to believe.

“Marines, the time has come. The Olkorian Domain has seen it fit to invade one of our worlds for their own gain. The Emperor has deemed it that they regret that decision until their last dying breath. The Navy has just begun their engagement of the enemy’s fleet above Hijin and will make sure no one stands in our way as we fulfill his majesty’s wishes. As such the Operation Order (OPO) still stands as follows: Landing Assault Ships will drop out of FTL below the enemy fleet and above our cities to deploy Aggressors via drop pod. As landing zones and the high orbitals are secured, Landing Platform Ships will begin their descent and deploy the rest of the division in force. Remember Marines, this is our home, check your fire, move quick, kill quick, and try not to blow everything up. That is all.”

Knowing that the General’s speech would start to rile up the entire OIP, Sergeant Adulet took charge of the mood.

“You heard the man Aggressors, check your fire. Civilians should mostly be in shelters, but we all know damn well situations can go to fuck all quicker than an FTL drive. Not to mention our Army counterparts will still be out and about doing a half ass job at keeping the enemy occupied. Let’s show them how it’s actually done. Am I Right Marines?”

“Sir, yes Sir,” yelled the Marines in a unison that had been drilled into their heads since day one of boot camp. 

“Uh huh damn right I am, because we all know, The Enemy Lives….”, the Sergeant asked with a smile on his face hidden behind his armor’s helmet.

“….because we allow it!” was the expected and given response from the eight other Marines.

While Sergeant Adulet had no doubt that the Army was doing its job of defending the planet, you didn’t call in Marines for simple actions, especially not members of the Special Orbit Service (SOS). More fondly known as Marine Aggressors, the special operations force was trained in rapid orbital insertions via Orbital Insertion Pods. Everything from deep insertion in force to sabotage was well within their forte. While the Legion specialized in the operations that most people would never hear about, if the Republic needed a large force to make a lot of noise and shit had officially hit the fan, it called SOS.

Throughout the pod each of the Marine Aggressors completed final checks on their rifles and accompanying equipment. The same was being done throughout the LAS as several platoons across dozens of OIPs prepared to meet the enemy. Each platoon had specific objectives that needed to be completed before the larger Marine force could make its presence known. To emphasize this the CO of Sergeant Adulet’s own platoon began to speak over the platoon channel.

“Listen up Alpha Platoon. As a reminder for those of you who weren’t paying attention during the initial brief, we’ll be dropping into the capital city of Bermin. Our objective is to clear out a section of the Central Business District to make way for the rest of our brethren.”

As the Lieutenant spoke an overlay was displayed in the Marines’ helmets showing a detailed map of the area. Insertion points, phase lines, and primary objective points were all highlighted with various colors and icons.

“After drop we’ll push to Phase Line Bush located in this large park. The park’s size and clearing means this will be a landing zone for additional forces. However, our work won’t be done yet. Nearby is a MagLev station that connects to the other cities in the region. IMINT from our stealth frigates has shown several enemy elements using the station as a base. This will be Phase Line Rail, and we are meant to evict the current tenants. Once we have done so we will hold a defensive posture while the LZ floods with Marines. Our job from then on is to be fluid and a pain in the enemy’s ass,” there was a short pause, “if they have one. Therefore, follow on objectives will come down as command sees fit. That’s all Alpha.”

No sooner after the Lieutenant finished his short rehashing of the mission briefing the telltale signs of deployment began as the drop pod’s interior was bathed in the red of a standby light and countdown timers displaying both the time to FTL exit and drop insertion. 60 seconds were displayed for the former and 90 seconds for the latter.

Depending on the drop pod these last seconds were either filled with dead silence or nervousness masked as excitement by the occupants. Whether intentionally or by pure chance there was never a mixture of the two behaviors in a pod. It was sort of an unspoken rule that given the squad moved as one on the ground, in the void the same would be true. For Sergeant Adulet’s pod silence was the tune of the hour as each Marine prepared in their own way. The Sergeant using his Neural Lace pulled up a picture of a coastal sunset on the world of Hino. One of the first major worlds colonized during humanity’s expansion to the stars, the terraformed planet has been a resort world for centuries with pristine beaches lined with palm trees and entertainment for civilians and service members alike. The Sergeant had amassed a small collection of similar photos from beaches across the Republic. Each place brought him comfort and something to look forward to in the future. Right now, however, the Sergeant and his men’s future would not be filled with relaxation and tranquility as the FTL exit timer reached zero.

As the Vesuvius exited FTL with the power down of its Celestial Engine, the ship and several others like it were greeted by the high orbitals of Hijin. Above them, an all-out massacre as the 5^(th) fleet removed an enemy force that was much smaller than the Republic’s own. Below them, the Marines’ own target which if all went well would see equally devastating results for the enemy on the ground. Before the enemy above could fully realize the arrival of the new ships “behind” their flank the drop insertion timer too reached zero and the Marines were finally let off their leashes.

Each Landing Assault Ship has their pre-determined insertion point with most of the ships releasing their deadly cargo above Hijin’s capital city. However, there were smaller groups which were tasked with deploying Marines to the other major cities on the planet, their own objectives being the same; remove the foreign invaders. Above the capital over a hundred OIPs filled the blue skies of the late morning. As the Marine force rapidly descended to the surface there was a noticeable lack of anti-air fire, something one of the privates in Sergeant Adulet’s own pod just had to point out.

“Well at least we’re not getting shot, eh Sarge,” quipped the naive Marine.

“For fuck sake’s Private why don’t you just hold up a sign that says ‘shoot us’, the Sergeant responded with some anger evident in his voice.

As if the universe heard his request, the pod started to shutter as the enemy below, who was on alert given the attack on their fleet, finally realized the attack was rapidly racing towards them. However, the Olkor would continue to be surprised as a single pod would not succumb to enemy fire. Conscious of the fact that such orbital insertions were dangerous, the Republic put considerable effort into ensuring both the pod itself and its occupants would survive in especially harsh environments. As such each OIP was equipped with its own hardlight shield emitter, not only to stave off enemy fire but to lessen the structural strain of a mass of composite materials hitting a planet at high velocity.

Naturally the OIP wouldn’t have to rely on brute stoppage to decelerate as shortly before impact chemical propellants rapidly decreased the pod’s speed to within acceptable margins. With a loud noise and upheaval of dirt, concrete, or asphalt, the Marines of the 218^(th) division had arrived. Each impact signified the arrival of nine Marines kitted out in a composite armor which wouldn’t be affected unless an enemy combatant got through the personal hardlight shields.

*Olkorian Domain Ship (ODS) Mak’Tar*

*Human Colony World*

*November 19, 3202*

Everything. Everything was going wrong and there wasn’t anything that Admiral Brahn could do about it. In a short order of time, the Olkor fleet under his command had been nearly decimated. The word nearly was relative as time moved forward, and the ship numbers decreased. Thousands of ships had descended on his fleet surrounding both his fleet and the planet in an unescapable net. A few cowards had tried to run, no doubt under the guise that they would be able to call for help, but reality thought differently as each one was obliterated before they could generate enough velocity.

On top of it all, several minutes ago another smaller fleet had appeared between his fleet and the human world below. Each ship propelling large objects towards the surface. The lack of explosions was a curious intrigue, but Admiral Brahn hadn’t had time to check in detail what that meant. No right now, he and what was left of his command staff were trying their best to keep what little control of the situation they had left intact.

“How many of us remain,” the Admiral shouted not as loud as he had hoped.

“Not enough sir. We’ve lost more than 80% of the fleet the last time I was able to check the sensors,” the officer responsible for said sensors responded.

The Admiral looked at the man with a questioning and fearful look. “What do you mean the last time you were able to check?”

“I….The sensors…..the sensors have been down for at least a minute Admiral.”

They were flying blind in a sea of enemy and friendly ships, each of which had their own dangers. Matter of fact, the Admiral noticed something else that didn’t seem to be operating. Most naval members after some time in the void had unconsciously tuned it out, but in the beginning, everyone couldn’t avoid the low hum of the ship’s engines. Right now, however, even as the Admiral listened with intent he couldn’t hear or feel their resonance as he sat in his command chair.

“Helm why have we stopped moving,” he turned towards the officer in question.

“Controls are not responding Admiral. Diagnostics was in the middle of running but the program crashed.”

“Crashed? How is that possible? Do we not have redundancies in place?”

“We do sir, but those for some reason have failed as well.”

The realization had suddenly hit the Admiral as he finally processed the full extent of the battle that was taking place around him. Given the abrupt situation it had taken him longer to account for everything. In the short time since the enemy arrived in force, his ship hadn’t been fired upon once. It was as if the enemy was purposely ignoring him. No that couldn’t be the case. Even if the shred of belief that the Olkor were still superior to these humans was increasingly becoming smaller, Admiral Brahn was not so much of a fool that he believed they wouldn’t notice his command ship, the largest in his own fleet.

No, that’s exactly what was happening, the humans had realized this was the flagship and were purposely avoiding destroying it, instead choosing to isolate it. So, if they weren’t being targeted by weapons fire, yet somehow their systems were down as if they had been dealt damage, what had been the cause? With another punch of awareness, the Admiral remembered that the humans had initiated contact 1^(st) when his fleet arrived above their world. The humans had spoken to him on his bridge before he could open a communication channel, which meant they had forced their way into their systems to do so. Knowing that this had to have been the case, the Admiral began to speak but before he could, a large thump could be heard on the blast door that sealed the bridge from the rest of the ship.

In the next five seconds everything that was going wrong outside of the ship in the void had found itself inside as the door was blown inward, smoke and debris taking its place. However, where an enemy border should had been there was nothing. But then the Admiral noticed a slight shift in the smoke. As he reached for his personal weapon but before he could fully extend it in the supposed direction of the enemy, a small blue flash of light impacted his chest.

Admiral Brahn suddenly felt very weak as he began to collapse towards the cold metallic plating of the floor. He could barely keep his eyes open as the sounds of muted weapons fire and the screams of his crew filled the bridge. As quickly as it had started the sounds transformed into an eerie silence. With what little consciousness he had left the Admiral could see a figure materialize above him clad in black armor. While he couldn’t see the exactly what inhabited the armor, the Admiral knew what was standing above him was a human soldier. The armor he saw was different from what his ground forces had reported. This one was slightly slimmer yet had an increased aura of danger. Another contrasting piece was noticeable on the armor’s left shoulder; a pictogram of a creature painted white with a black outline and eyes that seemed to float above a pointed weapon. Before he could fully contemplate what that creature was, the Admiral’s world fell silent and dark.

“Casper Actual to Claymore, Geronimo. I say again Geronimo.”

“Copy Casper Actual. Proceed to exfil.”

“Proceeding to exfil. Out. 3 & 4 carry four eyes. 5 & 6 you’re on point. Shadow since you’re still here would you be so kind to start the self-destruct sequence. The good Admiral here went down with his ship.”

On the large main bridge monitor a human thumbs up signaled the affirmation of the Mak’Tar’s unwanted guest’s command. Given that the same person responsible for the reply had no doubt already extracted all the information on the ship, there was no need to keep it around. Command wanted specific intel and the enemy fleet obliterated. The navy had handled the latter. It was up to members of the 70^(th) Cohort of the Legion to handle the former, for getting in and out without the enemy realizing they were there was their specialty. They were Phantoms after all.

Central Business District

*Bermin, Hijin, Vera System*

*November 19, 3202*

Alpha platoon, specifically Sergeant Adulet’s squad, had been planetside for a mere 40 minutes and in that time, they had thoroughly enjoyed what they were seeing. As it so happens the Army had actually been doing a decent job in annoying the enemy with what limited forces they had. Ambushes throughout the city had already placed the Olkor on the backfoot as their lines were disrupted even before the Marines showed up. It turns out that they had some key help along the way.

The city’s infrastructure AI was not a fan of its new unwelcome guests, even more so since they were threatening the populace he was in charge of keeping safe. The AI had used its power to close off sections of the city, routing enemy forces to where they could be taken care of by Army units who were waiting. Fire suppression systems had been triggered any time an Olkor entered a building. Right now, as the Sergeant’s squad took cover behind a concrete wall outside of the MagLev station two garbage trucks rammed an Olkor barricade flattening the Olkor who were posted there. To add insult to death, both trucks honked and on the display panels on the side of their containers the words “Keep Hijin Clean” were shown in big letters.

“I don’t know what the Infra AI’s vice is but whatever it is, I’m buying when this is all done,” shouted a lance corporal as the rest of the squad joined in on the laughter.

“For once lance corporal I agree with you,” responded Sergeant Adulet. “Those damn Olkor have to be confused as hell right now.”

While their new “drinking” buddy was making itself known, the Marines had not been solely idle as the squad began to push forward towards the MagLev station. Reaching one of the entrances, the squad stacked up and prepared to make their way inside. Their breacher, a man who stood a few inches taller than everyone else in the squad even outside of his armor, activated a hardlight barrier from the projector on his wrist before bringing it up to cover his front side.

On the Sergeant’s command the nine marines entered the station in a single line, weapons brought up sweeping the atrium for enemies. Before too long the Marines encountered them as enemy fire impacted the breacher’s barrier. Not wanting to be left out of the exchange of fire, the human Marines sent their own rounds down range.

Sergeant Adulet found his 1^(st) victim as an Olkor fired from behind the counter of a local coffee shop. His black rifle barked twice as his rounds impacted the Olkor’s chest and head piece in quick succession. Peering “through” the rifle’s scope he scanned the sector for anymore. Given that each of their rifle scopes were linked to their helmet’s technically he didn’t have to look through the scope directly as they primarily acted as advanced cameras. As a secondary function a Marine could still look through the scope directly, but the primary function had barely, if ever failed.

“Atrium clear. Squad move to the platform upstairs. Keep it tight,” Sergeant Adulet ordered his men.

Making their way up a large staircase and nearly reaching the top, the 2^(nd) man in the stack pulled out a stun grenade and tossed it over the top of the stairs with a powerful heave ensuring the device wouldn’t rolled back down towards them. Thanks to keen observations from other members of Alpha platoon word was quickly spread that the common Olkor soldier did not have any type of ear protection and stun grenades were just as effective as they were disorienting humans.

With the trademark loud bang groans of pain could be heard above as the Olkor oversight were thrown in their face. In less time than the Olkor recovered, the Marine squad leaped over the top stair, and each found a target on the platform to put out their misery. While the platform could easily hold a hundred people down its length the Olkor had all bunched up towards the stair’s entrance, probably in hopes of ambushing the Marines. That hope had been short lived as all of the Olkor on the platform were no longer living.

Letting out a sigh of relief he didn’t know he was holding Sergeant Adulet, keyed the platoon channel to report their status.

“Alpha 2-1 to Actual come in.”

“Actual to 2-1 send traffic.”

“We have completed all objective past Phase Line Rail. Hostiles have been neutralized. Over.”

“Solid copy 2-1. Hold one. Sending word up the chain.”

As the Sergeant waited, he looked back and down towards the park his squad had pushed through earlier. Resistance in the park had been minimal. There were two small patrols who were in the park when they hit dirt, but they were quickly dispatched as they were still in shock at the sudden appearance of the Marines. If there were any Olkor still left alive in range that shock was going to resurface as the loud and familiar sounds of Landing Platform Ships descended towards the open fields of the park.

With their ramps down each LPS barfed out a large contingent of Marine armor in the form of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. Before too long he even saw a Bridge Mobile Command Center disembark, the large behemoth setting itself up next to a pond as QEC arrays unfolded from the top. Turning his head upward, Sergeant Adulet could see a three-bird flight of AVT-94 Hercules gunships descend from orbit before splitting off to different parts of the city. Whichever Olkor had to deal with those flying tanks would very much prefer to deal with the ones on the ground instead. Continuing to take in the impressive force the 218^(th) had brought to bear, the platoon’s lieutenant spoke again.

“Alpha Actual to Alpha 2-1.”

“Alpha 2-1 to Actual, go ahead.”

“FRAGO as follows: Phase Line Governor is now active. Regulars will start to advance into the city and eliminate enemy forces. Your squad will meet up with Alpha 4 as lead element and proceed to Papa Hotel. Priority is to find and secure Governor until Regulars can enforce you and take over. You are free to eliminate all hostile en route but time is critical so make it count. CAS is on station and you’ve been given priority tasking. Call it as you need it. How copy over?”

“2-1 copies all Actual. Out”

Not exactly the assignment he would have wanted, preferring to charge towards the enemy’s main force and maybe destroying their command elements up close and personal, but the Sergeant couldn’t complain too much. They could still engage the enemy as they saw fit, and they got one of those shiny but deadly gunships to help them do so.

My dog gets more of my attention than the feed. Correct.

This is a live love letter; I’m still inside it...

Lately waking comes early and there’s no routine yet and the tile is still cold and I stand there a full minute so I don’t lie back down and the dog blinks at me like he’s counting and I tell myself maybe it will become useful, maybe...

Nights are simple. Dishes, the refrigerator’s hum. The dog turns twice on the rug and settles near the table. Sometimes he dribbles his squeaky toy down the hall like slow soccer, taps it off the baseboard, and looks at me for the pass. I lock the door, sit with water, and listen while the room settles, the way you listen to someone who doesn’t speak much...

You cross my mind on a schedule I don’t set, just a small mark in a notebook. When I get up to write, the dog lifts his head and then lets it drop again. Clarity is quieter than I expected. I am not starving; I’m choosing. I’m choosing you in the quiet, which is a strange way to say it, but true...

Sometimes I scroll. The feed wants a story and a **temprature**. It suggests it can find what’s missing. Maybe it can find too much. I don’t want it to find you. Or >!your name in my phone!<. If I look, I’ll do it slow, coincidence by coincidence, nothing that turns us into data. When I’ve stared too long, the dog rests his chin on my knee. The dog **don’t** judge. That’s the signal to stop.

Wanting is ordinary. Turning wanting into pressure isn’t. I try not to do that anymore. If we meet, I’d like us to stay intact. A bench, paper cups. We can look ahead for a while and not rush the talking. I’d like you to leave as yourself and still be yourself when you come back...

Some evenings I walk the dog around the block. The streetlights buzz. A bicycle goes by. One window stays lit. We make one loop and come back. That’s enough. I think about telling you something small and exact, like how the soap smells or how the collar clicks, because love is often that plain, and if you were here I’d point and you’d see it too.

A birthday project sits on the desk, yours. Paper, a few pages, steady work. If it holds, you’ll hear about it by the holidays. I won’t ask an algorithm to carry it. If anything helps, let it keep time. Nothing else. (>!working title: ""Early, Without a Routine""!<)

After midnight I count seven breaths by the window. The dog sighs and settles. I’m here; that’s already something. I hope you’re warm. I hope you slept. I hope the day didn’t take more than it gave (>!date: 10/30!<).

Morning comes early again. No routine yet, the floor is cool. Water on for coffee, standing, awake on purpose. I want to tell you the simple thing I haven’t said out loud, the one that keeps tapping the inside of my ribs, which is only that I miss you and I’m keeping a clear place for you and I will **definately** be there if you call and if you don’t I’ll still be here, awake on purpose, and if you were to knock right now I would",3,1755498613.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

1mteatp,https://i.redd.it/8aqoc3vw1qjf1.jpeg,Review #35: Dragon’s Milk Toasted Barrel 2024G,"Intro: Dragon’s Milk has been on my priority list of stuff to try in the craft distillery scene. I’ll admit, the bottle design is a huge factor in this. I’m glad to have a generous friend send me a sample of this to dip my toes in their juice. 
Proof: 118.3

Age: NAS (Company’s website states aged 5 years before finishing)

MSRP: $89.99

Rating system: https://imgur.com/a/iPG1uHa

Visual: 1.6, medium-thin legs. | 0.5 out of 1 point

Nose: Holy hell, what a tropical nose this thing has. Smells like a ripe mango, a bit of a pina colada nose, too. For a toasted barrel, I get very little of those oaky, coffee notes I usually fing in other toasted or double oaked bottles. It is there, don’t get me wrong, but it’s way underneath all of these other tropical notes. | 2 out of 2 points

Palate:  The mango punches through into the palate. I get a super ripe, super sappy mango note. It’s hard to get any other notes on it as the mango is sooo powerful here. Maybe a bit of oak? If this was a blind, I would not have guessed that this was toasted at all. This is a perfect summer sip, but this is one of those bottles where it’s either an amazing palate or disgusting. I feel like some drinkers may think of this palate as too out of the norm, which I understand. But for me, this is a surprising pour but in a good way.  | 3.5 out of 4 points

Finish: A little raw heat for a finish, like a mango habanero spice. Leaves fairly quick, which is the only gripe I really have with this pour.  | 1.5 out of 3 points

Gross score: 7.5

Value: I feel like this really depends on the drinker. As my notes show, this thing is super mango-y. I know that mango is a decently-common allergy and is also a nuanced flavor. If you’re into it, this thing is AMAZING. This is a note I thought I’d NEVER find in a bourbon. There is also very little of the usual toast notes. If you are looking for anything near quintessential bourbon or toasted barrel notes, the value of this would be 0. If you are open to these unusual notes, this is not a bad value. At the same time, $90 isn’t a small chunk of change. I’d gladly pay that for this bottle, but not much more. | 1.0x

Net: 7.5

FINAL VERDICT: At MSRP, this is a trip I think everyone should go on. I know fruity notes exist, but mango is such a far out, untamed fruit note that I never expected to come out of a wood barrel. I guess Dragon’s Milk beer influence bled into their bourbon, and I’m all for it.

1mteanj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyBizWins/comments/1mteanj/99_of_sales_execs_are_still_doing_prospect/,99% of Sales Execs Are Still Doing Prospect Research the Hard Way—Here’s How to Join the 1% Who Automate Wins,"If less than 1% of sales execs are using ChatGPT agents to automate prospect research, then 99% are basically gifting deals to the competition. According to the latest [pipeline.ai](http://pipeline.ai) survey, half of US sales professionals touch AI weekly—but almost none have automated the real work that moves the needle.

Here’s why it’s shocking:

In only three steps, you can automate your entire prospect research flow.

• AI scrapes thousands of profiles, scans their content, and builds custom summaries.

• It enriches each lead with insights pulled straight from their online footprint.

• You walk into every outreach knowing exactly what to say—before your coffee even kicks in.

Your competitors are automating faster than you think. The sales automation market will hit $8.8 billion in the US this year and companies with even basic automations see up to 25% more closed deals and 15% lower sales costs.

So if you’re not using AI to scout, sort, and qualify your next customer, someone else is. And the winner is rarely the one who makes the first call—it’s the one who arrives ridiculously, preternaturally prepared.

Your play: pick one workflow to automate this week and test your ROI in less time than it takes to miss a follow-up.",1,1755498339.0,EasyBizWins,0,1.0,False
