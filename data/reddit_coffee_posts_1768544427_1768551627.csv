1qeaa9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qeaa9o/aitah_im_hitting_the_edge_here/,AITAH. I'm hitting the edge here.,"Long post. Letting you all know beforehand.

I (20M) moved into my brother's (37M) houze 7 months ago due to career, housing, and college circumstances. He had always offered me to stay if I ever wanted to, so I took him up on that offer and decided to stay with him, but agreed to him that I'd be paying a sizeable portion of the rent, and my food bill. My brother once had a high-paying job 2 years ago, but he was since fired, so he works retail and relies on his girlfriend to basically pay the majority of the rent, with me and him now paying a smaller yet significantly portion of the rent. It's how it had to be with the job loss. 

We had an argument when I first moved in. He told me I was trying to use him by moving him, and I honestly felt bad about it, and already had my stuff in the car ready to sleep in there until I could find stable housing, but somehow we stopped the argument and went on. It was amazing a month in. I was about to be homeless, and I felt so grateful to have a place to rest my head, a roof over my head, and warm clothes. However, the longer living with my brother, I noticed something, he really doesn't treat his girlfriend well at all. He's constantly telling her she's fat and needs to lose weight, he's constantly accusing her of drugs and alcohol, looking in her phone which is says he can see through his app, controlling her every move, yelling at her with simple questions she'll ask like ""What do you want for dinner?"" He'll tell her, ""I'm not hungry and I need to go to ber. Why are you asking me?"" When she accomplishes something, he usually demeans her and criticizes her on it, telling her what she could've done better.

About 3 months in, he starts treating me in a similar manner. I sleep in the basement, so I'm separated from the house, but he started going down there when I was gone and digging through my belongings, questioning them, laughing at them, and asking me what I was going to do with them. I had a pile of gift cards and a savings collection down there that I was keeping incase I had to buy stuff in emergency. I had a collection of food and blankets in case I'd have to sleep in my car as it was cold in the winters here. I would come home and he'd be laughing at this like it was funny, and I told him I thought I was going to be homeless before. He told me I didn't know what true hardship looks like and that he has experienced it. He told me I've been given everything in life to me, and I've never really earned anything myself

Following this, he becomes adamant on telling me how I need to straighten and wrap my bed spread under the blankets out because it looks sloppy. I thought he was giving his own opinion, but I came home from a day of work and he was tearing my bed apart and straightening it. He told me this was his house and he makes the rules, and that I need to listen to him or else he's going to kick me out. I started spreading the bed spead out from then on as I respected that, but the following months he purchased me a coffee machine without asking me, but I was grateful for it. When I'd get ready for work, I'd slip a pod in it and make coffee. When I'd come home, I'd often take it out. Well, he figured out I'd leave the pod in the machine and started telling me to take it out right when it's done. I typically only have a max of 1 hour to get ready for work as I have full time college and a workout routine in the morning, so I never thought about taking it out as I'm always in the rush. Like the bed sheet incident, it became something he'd talk about constantly and yell at me consistently about until he snapped one day when I got home and told he he'd get ""rid of the fu**** coffee machine because I'm young to fu**** destroy it by leaving the pods in"". We got into an argument that lasted an hour and it ended with me sitting in my car wondering how I'm going to proceed and if I'm just an asshole for not taking the pod out. After this, I started taking the pod out.

We went 2 months without arguing, but he started making remarks about how ugly my hair looks or how weak I looked, or how I need to get better clothes because my clothes look sloppy. When I came home from work, he'd ask about my day, and I'd tell him everything. His girlfriend was always supportive of it and she'd constantly praise me, but my brother would criticize me. Especially when he learned my pay. After that, it was consistently about how little I make, and how I don't know what real work feels like. When I'd talk on the phone my my girlfriend (now ex), he would listen to our conversations through the vent that we share in the house and ask me what I was talking about, while telling me my relationship was a waste of time.

This all hit a tipping point a month ago when we got into it about a Playstation membership. My brother bought 5 PS5s and gave me one 5 years ago, but apparently he was paying for the membership, which I thought was really cool of him to do. The PS5 was a sensitive subject as it was related to another fight about 5 years ago wher my brother was living with my mom and all of us and threatened to kill us all. We hid in the closet of my mom's room for a day while he roamed the house. After that, I came out of the closet and he was sitting in the living room on the floor crying and I told him he could have the PS5 back as he was claiming he got us all this stuff and we weren't grateful for it. He hugged me and that was teh end of that memory. That was 5 years ago. Essentially that occurred again, but it started after I got my studded tires changed and he gave me cash as the guy only accepted cash (I was hesitant to accept it but I accepted it and told him I'd pay him back). Anyway, he came to be an 1 later, asking me why I haven't paid him yet, he started naming every single thing he has bought me and done for me and how I've been ungrateful and I don't know what love is or what appreciation is. He then threaten to kick me out again, got right up in my face and started challenging me.

I lost it. I told him to take the fu**** cash, and be done with me, and ran out the door. I sent him the cash over zelle. We didn't talk for 2 weeks. I lost my girlfriend arouns this time and I was extremely down in the gutters and we started talking again. He told me ""I'll have many girlfriends in my last. This one won't matter"", which felt really insensitive to me at the time. We've been talking for two weeks and he's already telling me about the sheets under the bed sheets being unstraightened and the shower curtain now being completely closed after I take a shower.

I'm really at a breaking point here. I don't know what to do. I want to leave. It feels like a prison to me.",1,1768551020.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

TL;DR / Summary

Married 21 years, two kids (8 & 13). Me 46, wife 47 

Over the last year I sensed something was off but dismissed it. My wife became secretive with her phone, stayed up late, and would often not reply to my messages. I trusted her completely and that maybe the reason I dismissed so much.  

On New Year’s Eve, after some inconsistencies in what she told me, she admitted she’d been active on online chat sites for the past 12–13 months. Over several days, I was gradually told more: she’d been talking to around 8 men, engaging in sexual messaging, phone sex, video chats, and voice notes, exchangingpictures. This happened while we were still intimate together and sometimes while I was caring for the kids.

I was devastated — barely slept, couldn’t eat, lost weight, and felt emotionally numb. What hurt most was the deception and how information only came out when I asked very specific questions. Even then, I still feel like there may be more she’s withholding.

She says she felt lonely, wanted to feel desired, and didn’t feel able to talk to me. I was dealing with health issues (psoriasis treatment and sleep apnea) during this time but never sought attention elsewhere.

One detail that really shook me: while I was in A&E late at night with one of our children, she checked and possibly chatted on the messaging apps. She initially denied this, then later admitted it.

She insists everything was online only, though she admits discussing a possible future meetup (coffee) and even mentioning our family holiday to one man. She says she would never have acted on it.

We’ve decided to try marriage counselling (initially separately). We’re keeping things stable for the kids — same house, routines, family activities. I love her and want this to work, but I don’t trust her right now. Part of me is fully committed to trying; another part can’t shake the feeling there’s still more I don’t know.

I’m looking for honest perspective and advice.

The entire day he somehow brought in the height topic, even when we got intimate when he had to close the curtains, he stated something like. “let me close the curtains else this woman will compliment me for my height “and his Instagram as well he followed random women I had also caught him talking to his ex, although it was just professional and I let it go because the guy suffers with phimosis and the need for external validation of confidence stems from this problem.

1qea3ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qea3ro/man_tried_to_get_me_to_follow_him_when_i_was/,Man Tried to Get Me to Follow Him When I Was Lucid Dreaming,"Hello! I have always had vivid dreams since I was a kid. Now as an adult I still do to the point that sometimes when I wake up I think what happened in my dream was real. However, it is rare for me to have lucid dreams and I did 3-4 years ago. This specific dream, I can’t stop thinking about and thought I would share it to see if anyone else has experienced this. 

In my dream I was in a cozy coffee shop. It was a big space with sofas, coffee tables, book shelves, and plants all around. The place was busy, but not too overcrowded. My dream started with me waiting for my coffee to be ready. When the barista called my name and I went to pick up my coffee I took a sip and almost spit it out. This is the exact moment I became aware that I was dreaming. I hate black coffee and that was what I was given. I love sugar in my coffee so I went up to the barista and asked her if she could pour creamer. I remember she completely stopped what she was doing, looked at me strangely and said she could and did so. When she gave me back my coffee I went to sit on a sofa and enjoy my drink. About a minute or so later a man came to sit next to me and told me he knew I was aware I was in a dream. I asked him what he was talking about and he said he saw me change my coffee order and that is how he knew. He said everyone else wasn’t aware that they are in a dream, that only him and I were aware in this coffee shop. I don't know how to explain it, but he just didn’t give me a good vibe so I answered him “Okay and what does that mean? I just want to enjoy my coffee.” He said that since I gained consciousness he could show me around the dream realm and asked me to go with him so I could see what he was talking about. He said he could be my guide and show me places. I told him that I was not interested (as I said his vibe just felt off). He kept on insisting I follow him and I told him to leave me alone. He did not want to so I got up and moved to another sofa to drink my coffee. Shortly after that I jumped to another dream.

If anyone has had an experience like this please let me know! I still don't fully understand what it means and I am still glad I did not follow that man.

1qea1cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EVGA/comments/1qea1cc/3090_ti_thermal_disaster_please_help/,3090 Ti - Thermal Disaster - PLEASE HELP,"I've read probably every thermal-related post in this entire subreddit and tried everything under the sun to fix this myself, but I am at the end of my rope. I figured as a last-ditch effort I'd ask the community for their thoughts.

  
I purchased a 3090 Ti in October of 2022 at MicroCenter.  
  
Starting approximately two weeks ago, out of nowhere, with zero modification and at stock settings, it began to overheat and display wildly high temperatures under load, instantly, with no ramp-up or slow-build.  
  
I will give a step by step example:  
  
1. Idling \~48C  
2. Launch Star Wars: The Old Republic, maximum settings, 3840 x 1440 resolution  
3. Frame rate is capped at 144 fps with v-sync enabled via nvidia control panel  
4. At the login screen showing rendered characters, fans ramp up to 100%  
5. Log into a character  
6. When the world loads, GPU temp spikes to 90+ within 5 seconds, hotspot at 105  
7. Application crash occurs after approximately 60 seconds  
  
This is also repeatable more simply in RuneScape 3(seriously, RUNESCAPE):  
  
1. Log in to RuneScape with idle temps around 50C  
2. Character loads into the world, temps spike to 92+ instantly, hotspot \~105, fans at 100%  
3. Game crashes

Through all my testing since noticing this issue, I have left the side panel off of my PC case to eliminate airflow as a factor, and it has made zero difference.

I have attempted undervolting and setting power limits, but any power limit above 50% leaves the card spiking up over 100 in hotspots and sustained at 90+. The only marginally usable setting I have found is the OC Scanner in Afterburner, but even that puts GPU temps at 90 and Hotspot at 99, with throttling down to a max of \~1700mhz. Even with locking at 875mV and clocks at 1700 or 1800mhz, I am still getting temps at 90C and hotspots hovering just around 98-99.

It is worth mentioning that before two weeks ago, I was able to breeze through basically any game in existence at max settings and the temps would climb no higher than 70C. No components were changed, there were no airflow changes, and the ambient temperature of the room did not change. This high temp behavior appeared out of nowhere.

  
Based on my research and other users' experiences, there is a known issue with Thermal Pads and Thermal Paste with my model of GPU. It was suggested that I replace that myself, but I also saw reports of users RMA'ing their cards successfully for this identical reason.  
  
For all intents and purposes, this $1100+ GPU is just a space heater that is actively destroying my PC every time I try to use it, to the point I've explored downgrading to a 5070 to be rid of it(or side-grading to something idiotic like the 7900 XTX), essentially costing me $650-$1000 for worse performance to remedy a design flaw.

I reached out to EVGA and was told that my card was not covered by any warranty or RMA(if the period was 3 years, I was literally 90 days outside of that window). They sent the following pad dimensions:

  
GPU:  
  
Two pads are 53x14x2.25  
One pad is 16x13x2.25  
One pad is 38x14x2.25  
One pad is 77x7x2.75  
One pad is 110x5x2.25  
  
Backplate:  
  
Two pads are 52x12x2.75  
One pad is 40x12x2.75  
One pad is 15x10x2.75  
One pad is 15x7x1.75

However, these dimensions cannot be correct, as the GPU possesses at least two pairs of near-identical pads(what was sent includes only one pair, and there are no two close enough to each other to be ""nearly"" pairs).

After the denial from EVGA, I opened the card, cleaned every square inch of the GPU and heatsink with alcohol on coffee filter paper, and replaced the paste with Duronaut. After reassembly, the thermal performance was identical to before. I ordered a PTM pad. I disassembled and cleaned it again and applied the PTM pad, cut to size. Same issue. Before you ask, yes, I torqued the screws in a cross pattern, evenly, slowly, and did not force or over-torque any screws. I also used this method on the back plate.

At this point I'm at a total and complete loss on what to do. The thermal pad dimensions given by EVGA are not correct, and even if the pads were bad, aren't they wholly irrelevant to GPU temps? My VRAM temps are perfect(50-60) throughout all this, so a simple re-paste should have done the job, and if the thermal pads were bad, then the VRAM temps would also be running away.

  
The thing that boggles my mind the most is that this was a sudden-onset issue. If it were paste or pads, wouldn't this have been a progressive issue rather than a 50C to 100+C delta overnight? And why is EVGA suggesting to me directly that it's a known issue but ""good luck on your own, we will not help you with a known issue""? That seems counter to the raving reviews and firsthand accounts of users all across this subreddit about EVGA support.

TL;DR - Temps 90+ GPU, 100+ hotspot. EVGA denied RMA despite known issue. Repaste did nothing. PTM pad did nothing. Open side panel/direct air did nothing.

Quick question to help settle a discussion I'm having with my partner. 

If you were on gould cresent turning right on ferry road heading to the woolworths and another car was also turning right from alport place with traffic being clear in both directions  how would you do it from following situations...

  
1) Both drive forward and turn right essentially going around each other.

  
2) Wait for the driver at thebither road to go first and then go after them.

3) Something different.

  
Will let you know later what I did and what nearly caused us to die (parents words not mine).",3,1768550100.0,chch,6,0.8,False

While checking out Google Maps listings for local food options around Phase 3, I noticed Madrasi Raja at Megapolis Serenity Market (opp. Pawar Public School). It shows up on food platforms like Zomato with a ~4.2 rating and a few hundred ratings, mainly for South Indian classics and quick beverages/snacks that are reasonably priced for everyday eats around here. 

From what I can gather, people seem to order breakfast items like idli/dosa combos, filter coffee, and similar options — nothing too fancy, just solid everyday food without breaking the bank. Cost seems to be around ~₹150 per person on average, and takeaway/home delivery appears available through listings too (though Swiggy shows delivery may not always cover the outlet area). 

I haven’t personally eaten there yet, so sharing this based on reviews and menus; it could be a handy quick-meal/coffee spot if you’re nearby or want a South Indian breakfast close to the office.

Minor downside is the startup time in the morning, but as long as I'm not in a rush, it's fine. 
The first machine wasn't working, but the company I bought through was lovely and sent me a new machine out within the same week (Clumsy Goat for those in the UK - highly recommend).

1qe9xvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qe9xvr/im_hitting_the_edge/,I'm hitting the edge.,"I'm hitting the edge. Long post everyone. Letting you know ahead of time.

I (20M) moved into my brother's (37M) houze 7 months ago due to career, housing, and college circumstances. He had always offered me to stay if I ever wanted to, so I took him up on that offer and decided to stay with him, but agreed to him that I'd be paying a sizeable portion of the rent, and my food bill. My brother once had a high-paying job 2 years ago, but he was since fired, so he works retail and relies on his girlfriend to basically pay the majority of the rent, with me and him now paying a smaller yet significantly portion of the rent. It's how it had to be with the job loss. 

We had an argument when I first moved in. He told me I was trying to use him by moving him, and I honestly felt bad about it, and already had my stuff in the car ready to sleep in there until I could find stable housing, but somehow we stopped the argument and went on. It was amazing a month in. I was about to be homeless, and I felt so grateful to have a place to rest my head, a roof over my head, and warm clothes. However, the longer living with my brother, I noticed something, he really doesn't treat his girlfriend well at all. He's constantly telling her she's fat and needs to lose weight, he's constantly accusing her of drugs and alcohol, looking in her phone which is says he can see through his app, controlling her every move, yelling at her with simple questions she'll ask like ""What do you want for dinner?"" He'll tell her, ""I'm not hungry and I need to go to ber. Why are you asking me?"" When she accomplishes something, he usually demeans her and criticizes her on it, telling her what she could've done better.

About 3 months in, he starts treating me in a similar manner. I sleep in the basement, so I'm separated from the house, but he started going down there when I was gone and digging through my belongings, questioning them, laughing at them, and asking me what I was going to do with them. I had a pile of gift cards and a savings collection down there that I was keeping incase I had to buy stuff in emergency. I had a collection of food and blankets in case I'd have to sleep in my car as it was cold in the winters here. I would come home and he'd be laughing at this like it was funny, and I told him I thought I was going to be homeless before. He told me I didn't know what true hardship looks like and that he has experienced it. He told me I've been given everything in life to me, and I've never really earned anything myself

Following this, he becomes adamant on telling me how I need to straighten and wrap my bed spread under the blankets out because it looks sloppy. I thought he was giving his own opinion, but I came home from a day of work and he was tearing my bed apart and straightening it. He told me this was his house and he makes the rules, and that I need to listen to him or else he's going to kick me out. I started spreading the bed spead out from then on as I respected that, but the following months he purchased me a coffee machine without asking me, but I was grateful for it. When I'd get ready for work, I'd slip a pod in it and make coffee. When I'd come home, I'd often take it out. Well, he figured out I'd leave the pod in the machine and started telling me to take it out right when it's done. I typically only have a max of 1 hour to get ready for work as I have full time college and a workout routine in the morning, so I never thought about taking it out as I'm always in the rush. Like the bed sheet incident, it became something he'd talk about constantly and yell at me consistently about until he snapped one day when I got home and told he he'd get ""rid of the fu**** coffee machine because I'm young to fu**** destroy it by leaving the pods in"". We got into an argument that lasted an hour and it ended with me sitting in my car wondering how I'm going to proceed and if I'm just an asshole for not taking the pod out. After this, I started taking the pod out.

We went 2 months without arguing, but he started making remarks about how ugly my hair looks or how weak I looked, or how I need to get better clothes because my clothes look sloppy. When I came home from work, he'd ask about my day, and I'd tell him everything. Sometimes he would (and still does) try to humiliate me in front of guests by telling them I beat off downstairs all day. His girlfriend was always supportive of it and she'd constantly praise me, but my brother would criticize me. Especially when he learned my pay. After that, it was consistently about how little I make, and how I don't know what real work feels like. When I'd talk on the phone my my girlfriend (now ex), he would listen to our conversations through the vent that we share in the house and ask me what I was talking about, while telling me my relationship was a waste of time.

This all hit a tipping point a month ago when we got into it about a Playstation membership. My brother bought 5 PS5s and gave me one 5 years ago, but apparently he was paying for the membership, which I thought was really cool of him to do. The PS5 was a sensitive subject as it was related to another fight about 5 years ago wher my brother was living with my mom and all of us and threatened to kill us all. We hid in the closet of my mom's room for a day while he roamed the house. After that, I came out of the closet and he was sitting in the living room on the floor crying and I told him he could have the PS5 back as he was claiming he got us all this stuff and we weren't grateful for it. He hugged me and that was teh end of that memory. That was 5 years ago. Essentially that occurred again, but it started after I got my studded tires changed and he gave me cash as the guy only accepted cash (I was hesitant to accept it but I accepted it and told him I'd pay him back). Anyway, he came to be an 1 later, asking me why I haven't paid him yet, he started naming every single thing he has bought me and done for me and how I've been ungrateful and I don't know what love is or what appreciation is. He then threaten to kick me out again, got right up in my face and started challenging me.

I lost it. I told him to take the fu**** cash, and be done with me, and ran out the door. I sent him the cash over zelle. We didn't talk for 2 weeks. I lost my girlfriend around this time and I was extremely down in the gutters and we started talking again. He told me ""I'll have many girlfriends in my future. This one won't matter"", which felt really insensitive to me at the time. We've been talking for two weeks and he's already telling me about the sheets under the bed sheets being unstraightened and the shower curtain now being completely closed after I take a shower. I've begun buying my own silverware, using my own pots pans, plates, bowls, etc. Avoiding any lights being on to keep the electric bill down, so I live in my downstairs area in the dark. He told me it costs a lot of money in electric bills to have me here and I'm honestly feeling like a piece of frickin shit and burden. Everytime he tells me he's going to get me something, I refuse it and tell him I don't want it. I feel like whatever I accept from him is not actually a gift, but a control device as that's how he has used it. Like the PS5, like the coffee machine, and he recently bought me a tv that he set up in my room without me even asking, and I told him I don't watch tv or play games.

Phantom phone calls.

The phone kept ringing, and I was just about to pick up when Jen beat me to it.

“Welcome to Paranormal Personnel. Jennifer speaking, how may I help you?”

She put on her telephone voice and I found it fascinating that she sounded so different when she spoke to a client. Maybe Jen was an actress in another life. Who knew?

It was a busy day and I still had several more reports to finish, but I kept glancing back at the clock on the wall. I was consciously aware of my upcoming meeting with La Caz Pharmaceutical. I also remembered that I was supposed to text my cousin, Claudia. We were having dinner together later this evening and I was looking forward to catching up with her. We hadn’t seen each other for months.

“Hello? Hello?” Jennifer repeated a few times, sounding annoyed this time. Seconds later, she slammed the phone down, then furiously started typing away on her keyboard. This wasn’t our first dead call today.

“Another false alarm?” I asked, a little amused, although it really wasn’t funny. Over the past several weeks, we’d been getting dead phone calls at least three times a day. I reported it to Rufus, my regional manager, but he wasn’t very concerned about it. It seemed someone was trying to spook us, and it was becoming extremely irritating. Maybe it was time to speak to my dad about it.

“Yeah, it’s the third one today. I haven’t dumped anyone recently, so it’s none of my exes,” she responded, then the phone rang again.

“Welcome to Parano—”

“Hello, hello,” the deep, raspy voice on the other end of the line interrupted me, then my fingertips sparkled.

“My name is Julia. How can I help you today?” I asked more firmly. I didn’t like being interrupted.

“I just moved to London and I’m looking for a job. Would you have anything for a werewolf, love?” the voice asked, and I exhaled with relief. At least this guy was serious for a change.

“Of course, what are you looking for? Factory, security, or maybe you’re much more skilled—”

“Listen to me very carefully, love,” the man cut me off again. “I haven’t got much time, and they’re listening in. Female elves around London have been going missing, and I think you might be next.” For a split second, I was certain that he was pulling my leg, but he sounded so serious. I glanced at Jennifer who was chewing on her pen, watching me from her desk. She must have noticed my stunned expression.

“Female elves are going missing?” I repeated to make sure that we are on the same page. “This is a recruitment agency, sir. Maybe you should call the police instead? I know someone there who can help you.”

I had been working in this industry for a couple of years now and was used to people trying to share their personal problems with me, but this was certainly new.

“No. This is important. He wants the blood of elves and fairies. I have been watching you and I wanted to warn you before it’s too late,” the man continued, and this time a cold shiver crawled over my spine. I gripped the phone tighter, thinking that this wasn’t a joke. This guy really believed that I was in danger.

“Have you been calling here and hanging up over the past few weeks?” I asked with anger lacing my tone. The guy obviously had some issues. Either way, I needed to be more firm with him. The dead phone calls interfered with our busy schedule and we couldn’t afford to waste so much time.

There was silence on the other end of the line for a bit. Then he breathed in heavily and I shook my head.

“Stay safe, and watch out for a black van on the streets,” he finally snapped, then the phone went dead. I rubbed my face as magic began surging down my spine. There was no point getting worked up about this. I lived in London and the truth was that the city was dangerous anyway. My father worked as a police constable, and he told me himself that paranormals were going missing all the time.

“Who was that?” Jen asked. I was taking long deep breaths trying to calm down. The lights in the office were flickering and that was all my doing. I was half elf from my father’s side, and most of the time I couldn’t fully control my powers. I was very clumsy too—the proof of which lie in the sink—broken cups and other dishes. Every week, I had to throw away several burned out light bulbs. It was a nightmare.

“No idea, just some werewolf trying to scare me. Apparently, a lot of elves are being abducted in the city. He said that I might be next. I think he’s the one who’s been calling here all time and not saying anything when we pick up.”

Jennifer shook her head and continued to work. I got up, then went to our so-called kitchen—it smelled like someone had stored a pile of dead bodies in there. I switched the kettle on, thinking about my day, and feeling very hungry all of a sudden. It was only half past twelve and I was ready to devour my sandwiches, or maybe even go out and pick up something from the supermarket. I didn’t know what was wrong with me, but I assumed there was nothing wrong with having a healthy appetite. My magic was still whacky. At least later on I had a business meeting to look forward to. I quickly made coffee and added a spoonful of sugar to my favourite cup. Then I put one spoon of coffee in Jennifer’s cup and topped it up with six spoonsful of sugar. Jennifer was a purebred mermaid. She loved sugary drinks, but never had to worry about her figure.

London was filled with a lot of supernatural creatures: there were elves, fairies, vampires, werewolves, hags, shifters, trolls, mermaids and giants. Humans had no idea about our true nature because we could disguise ourselves pretty damn well. Most of us had magical powers, but to any human out there, we all looked ordinary.

I pulled my lunch from the fridge and sipped my coffee for a while. My thoughts trailed off to the time when I found out that I wasn’t an ordinary human. I was sitting in my grandparents living room at their large house located in the country. I was around ten years old then, maybe older, playing with puzzles when one started melting all of a sudden.

I glanced down at my tiny hands wondering what was going on when my grandmother walked inside.

“Oh, don’t worry about it dear. You’re an elf, which means that you have magic inside of you,” she explained, placing me on her lap. Sometimes grandma was nice, well, when she wanted to be.

“Is Mummy an elf too?” I asked her.

“No, darling, your mother is just a human. She will never be like any of us,” Grandma said, staring at me intensely. “And now, you have to promise me that you will keep this a secret. You’re still young, so your abilities aren’t developed yet, but soon, that might change.”

My father was angry with her when he found out that she’d told me the truth. I heard him say that I was too young to know about stuff like that. He was right, but I still understood what she was saying. After all, I moved things before without even touching them. My skin often twitched, buzzed, and sparkled, trying to release all the excess magic I didn’t know that I had. Once during an English lesson, I was upset—the teacher didn’t pick me for the school play—so, I blew up his coffee mug. No one knew it was me and I never told anyone about this, but deep down, I knew I had some sort of gift. Now I understood that it wasn’t all just a coincidence.

From that day forward, I had to see my grandma every other weekend to train with her. This went on for several months until I almost burned the house down. After that, Grandma agreed that maybe I was too young for magic.

I knew that there was always something wrong with me. I felt suffocated by the fact that I couldn’t control my energy.

Some of my cousins called me a freak, and admitted that I wasn’t like any of them. I only had half of the elven magical genes inside of me. On top of that, I was extremely clumsy. There were other factors that contributed to my lack of self-belief. I practised, but I always knew that I would never be like the rest of my family.

My magic would explode randomly, and I was scaring humans. My grandmother decided that she couldn’t teach me anything more. She gave up, and I just had to deal with it, try to embrace my inability to control the magic that was still growing inside of me.

I just didn’t think that I could ever fit in anywhere. I was destined to be the halfblooded elf who would never be able to control her own abilities.

I quickly dismissed those thoughts, telling myself that I couldn’t think like that. I was independent, had a good job and loving parents. No one could take that away from me.

Once I was done with lunch, I had to call several tooth fairies around London in an attempt to match one to a job opening we had available.

Even paranormals needed jobs, and we were the first agency that had opened up in the area. I wasn’t interested in being a policewoman. That wasn’t my kind of thing anymore. Besides, my magic was too unstable to think about chasing after criminals.

By quarter to four, I changed into my best suit, styled my hair, and reapplied my makeup. Jennifer was already waiting for me by the door. Half an hour earlier, my two other colleagues had arrived, so we could leave for our meeting.

“Oh, look at you, girl. You look hot!” Jennifer exclaimed, eyeing me from head to toe.

“It’s just a suit, Jen, nothing special,” I said, then glanced at her. Jennifer looked really good too and it was then that I noticed she must have gotten a haircut. I wondered whether she swam in one of those lakes outside London just to make herself more irresistible to vamps. It was in her nature to be close to the water; she didn’t have a tail or anything, but she told me once that she wasn’t herself when she didn’t use the pool at least once a week.

She had on slim-fit cream trousers and a zip-front dark blouse with a well-fitted cream blazer. “By the way, you don’t look so bad yourself.”

“I told you, that vamp who owns La Caz Pharmaceutical is sizzling hot, and I want to make a good impression,” she said. “We need to get going so we’re not late.”

I nodded, thinking that maybe she was exaggerating. She tended to do that, but I knew I needed to be ready for anything. Men intimidated me a little bit, but I was good at my job, so there was no need to be nervous. When we were walking to Jen’s car, my skin started prickling with magic. I just wanted to make sure that I wouldn’t screw anything up.

“Do you know where you’re going?” I asked her once we were out on the main street. It was a busy day and there was so much traffic on the roads.

“East London to Brunel Industrial Park.”

I nodded and didn’t say anything else. Jennifer had lived in London all her life and once she started the engine, she seemed to know where we were heading. Soon, she magically avoided the busiest streets, taking us away from the traffic.

An hour later, we stopped in front of the large entrance to La Caz Pharmaceutical where a few werewolves checked whether our names were on the list. It was dark, and rain was pouring from the smoky sky when we reached the underground car park belonging to La Caz. CCTV cameras were everywhere. I felt we were being watched the minute we drove through the entrance. Magic was sparkling along my skin more than usual; I really needed to pull myself together.

“Wow, this place is huge. I didn’t expect all these cars here,” Jennifer chuckled, switching off the engine. I frowned and followed her gaze. In the back, I saw a round of brand-new Audis. I didn’t know anything about cars, but I recognised the brand straightaway.

“Excuse me, ladies. Is either of you Julia Taylor?” a tall man approaching us asked when we started walking towards the lifts.

He startled us a little bit appearing out of nowhere. I had a feeling that he must have been waiting for us.

“That would be me,” I replied, straightening my skirt.

“If you please, follow me—you’re expected,” the man said. He was a werewolf. Paranormals could recognise each other; we sensed the magic and knew instantly if someone was a vampire, elf, fairy, or otherwise. Humans on the other hand, were clueless. They had no idea that we were living amongst them.

“This is so exciting,” Jennifer whispered once we were in the main entrance. I didn’t know what Jennifer meant. This place was giving me the creeps.

When we walked inside, I was taken aback by all the bare white walls and granite flooring. The La Caz Pharmaceutical lobby was clean and well-presented. A few more security guards were staring at computer screens. Vampires, elves, werewolves, shapeshifters, and a few wizards were walking in and out of the building. No one paid much attention to us. The werewolf with the name tag, “Todd” told us that our meeting would start in twenty minutes and showed us to the lift.

“How many people are currently employed here?” I asked him.

“I think over two thousand, miss,” he replied.

La Caz was doing a fantastic job and Rufus would definitely need to give me a raise if we signed him up today.

I exchanged a hopeful look with Jennifer, then followed Todd to the spacious reception area when we reached our floor.

“These ladies have a meeting with Mr. La Caz,” Todd announced. He nodded to us, then vanished into the lift.

We were asked to sit on the comfortable white leather sofas. The walls, floors, and even the furniture was all white. I thought that La Caz had to be some kind of stuck-up rich guy to like that colour so much. I didn’t know much about vampires; my kind tended to stay away from them. Apparently, our blood was very intoxicating, and they craved it more than human blood.

The receptionist had a large desk with at least three computer screens. She glanced at us for a few seconds after offering us refreshments. On my right, I saw the large white doors that most likely led to a conference room, and my stomach lurched again. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I just wanted to get this over with. I wished I’d eaten something other than that sandwich before I left; now I was not only nervous, but hungry as well. Jennifer was whispering about her swimming experience from the previous evening, when the large white doors opened, and a very tall werewolf emerged.

“Miss Julia Taylor and Jennifer Griffiths, Paranormal Personnel?” he asked the secretary. She nodded, then motioned for us to go ahead.

He noticed us and said, “Mr. La Caz is ready to begin.”

A cold chill spread across my shoulders. I was ready to throw up.

Jennifer and I looked at each other, then walked through the door. I thought that it was time to get this show on the road before I vomited and made an absolute fool of myself.",1,1768549722.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Female elves around London have been going missing, and I think you might be next.” For a split second, I was certain that he was pulling my leg, but he sounded so serious. I glanced at Jennifer who was chewing on her pen, watching me from her desk. She must have noticed my stunned expression.

“Female elves are going missing?” I repeated to make sure that we are on the same page. “This is a recruitment agency, sir. Maybe you should call the police instead? I know someone there who can help you.”

I had been working in this industry for a couple of years now and was used to people trying to share their personal problems with me, but this was certainly new.

“No. This is important. He wants the blood of elves and fairies. I have been watching you and I wanted to warn you before it’s too late,” the man continued, and this time a cold shiver crawled over my spine. I gripped the phone tighter, thinking that this wasn’t a joke. This guy really believed that I was in danger.

“Have you been calling here and hanging up over the past few weeks?” I asked with anger lacing my tone. The guy obviously had some issues. Either way, I needed to be more firm with him. The dead phone calls interfered with our busy schedule and we couldn’t afford to waste so much time.

There was silence on the other end of the line for a bit. Then he breathed in heavily and I shook my head.

“Stay safe, and watch out for a black van on the streets,” he finally snapped, then the phone went dead. I rubbed my face as magic began surging down my spine. There was no point getting worked up about this. I lived in London and the truth was that the city was dangerous anyway. My father worked as a police constable, and he told me himself that paranormals were going missing all the time.

“Who was that?” Jen asked. I was taking long deep breaths trying to calm down. The lights in the office were flickering and that was all my doing. I was half elf from my father’s side, and most of the time I couldn’t fully control my powers. I was very clumsy too—the proof of which lie in the sink—broken cups and other dishes. Every week, I had to throw away several burned out light bulbs. It was a nightmare.

“No idea, just some werewolf trying to scare me. Apparently, a lot of elves are being abducted in the city. He said that I might be next. I think he’s the one who’s been calling here all time and not saying anything when we pick up.”

Jennifer shook her head and continued to work. I got up, then went to our so-called kitchen—it smelled like someone had stored a pile of dead bodies in there. I switched the kettle on, thinking about my day, and feeling very hungry all of a sudden. It was only half past twelve and I was ready to devour my sandwiches, or maybe even go out and pick up something from the supermarket. I didn’t know what was wrong with me, but I assumed there was nothing wrong with having a healthy appetite. My magic was still whacky. At least later on I had a business meeting to look forward to. I quickly made coffee and added a spoonful of sugar to my favourite cup. Then I put one spoon of coffee in Jennifer’s cup and topped it up with six spoonsful of sugar. Jennifer was a purebred mermaid. She loved sugary drinks, but never had to worry about her figure.

London was filled with a lot of supernatural creatures: there were elves, fairies, vampires, werewolves, hags, shifters, trolls, mermaids and giants. Humans had no idea about our true nature because we could disguise ourselves pretty damn well. Most of us had magical powers, but to any human out there, we all looked ordinary.

I pulled my lunch from the fridge and sipped my coffee for a while. My thoughts trailed off to the time when I found out that I wasn’t an ordinary human. I was sitting in my grandparents living room at their large house located in the country. I was around ten years old then, maybe older, playing with puzzles when one started melting all of a sudden.

I glanced down at my tiny hands wondering what was going on when my grandmother walked inside.

“Oh, don’t worry about it dear. You’re an elf, which means that you have magic inside of you,” she explained, placing me on her lap. Sometimes grandma was nice, well, when she wanted to be.

“Is Mummy an elf too?” I asked her.

“No, darling, your mother is just a human. She will never be like any of us,” Grandma said, staring at me intensely. “And now, you have to promise me that you will keep this a secret. You’re still young, so your abilities aren’t developed yet, but soon, that might change.”

My father was angry with her when he found out that she’d told me the truth. I heard him say that I was too young to know about stuff like that. He was right, but I still understood what she was saying. After all, I moved things before without even touching them. My skin often twitched, buzzed, and sparkled, trying to release all the excess magic I didn’t know that I had. Once during an English lesson, I was upset—the teacher didn’t pick me for the school play—so, I blew up his coffee mug. No one knew it was me and I never told anyone about this, but deep down, I knew I had some sort of gift. Now I understood that it wasn’t all just a coincidence.

From that day forward, I had to see my grandma every other weekend to train with her. This went on for several months until I almost burned the house down. After that, Grandma agreed that maybe I was too young for magic.

I knew that there was always something wrong with me. I felt suffocated by the fact that I couldn’t control my energy.

Some of my cousins called me a freak, and admitted that I wasn’t like any of them. I only had half of the elven magical genes inside of me. On top of that, I was extremely clumsy. There were other factors that contributed to my lack of self-belief. I practised, but I always knew that I would never be like the rest of my family.

My magic would explode randomly, and I was scaring humans. My grandmother decided that she couldn’t teach me anything more. She gave up, and I just had to deal with it, try to embrace my inability to control the magic that was still growing inside of me.

I just didn’t think that I could ever fit in anywhere. I was destined to be the halfblooded elf who would never be able to control her own abilities.

I quickly dismissed those thoughts, telling myself that I couldn’t think like that. I was independent, had a good job and loving parents. No one could take that away from me.

Once I was done with lunch, I had to call several tooth fairies around London in an attempt to match one to a job opening we had available.

Even paranormals needed jobs, and we were the first agency that had opened up in the area. I wasn’t interested in being a policewoman. That wasn’t my kind of thing anymore. Besides, my magic was too unstable to think about chasing after criminals.

By quarter to four, I changed into my best suit, styled my hair, and reapplied my makeup. Jennifer was already waiting for me by the door. Half an hour earlier, my two other colleagues had arrived, so we could leave for our meeting.

“Oh, look at you, girl. You look hot!” Jennifer exclaimed, eyeing me from head to toe.

“It’s just a suit, Jen, nothing special,” I said, then glanced at her. Jennifer looked really good too and it was then that I noticed she must have gotten a haircut. I wondered whether she swam in one of those lakes outside London just to make herself more irresistible to vamps. It was in her nature to be close to the water; she didn’t have a tail or anything, but she told me once that she wasn’t herself when she didn’t use the pool at least once a week.

She had on slim-fit cream trousers and a zip-front dark blouse with a well-fitted cream blazer. “By the way, you don’t look so bad yourself.”

“I told you, that vamp who owns La Caz Pharmaceutical is sizzling hot, and I want to make a good impression,” she said. “We need to get going so we’re not late.”

I nodded, thinking that maybe she was exaggerating. She tended to do that, but I knew I needed to be ready for anything. Men intimidated me a little bit, but I was good at my job, so there was no need to be nervous. When we were walking to Jen’s car, my skin started prickling with magic. I just wanted to make sure that I wouldn’t screw anything up.

“Do you know where you’re going?” I asked her once we were out on the main street. It was a busy day and there was so much traffic on the roads.

“East London to Brunel Industrial Park.”

I nodded and didn’t say anything else. Jennifer had lived in London all her life and once she started the engine, she seemed to know where we were heading. Soon, she magically avoided the busiest streets, taking us away from the traffic.

An hour later, we stopped in front of the large entrance to La Caz Pharmaceutical where a few werewolves checked whether our names were on the list. It was dark, and rain was pouring from the smoky sky when we reached the underground car park belonging to La Caz. CCTV cameras were everywhere. I felt we were being watched the minute we drove through the entrance. Magic was sparkling along my skin more than usual; I really needed to pull myself together.

“Wow, this place is huge. I didn’t expect all these cars here,” Jennifer chuckled, switching off the engine. I frowned and followed her gaze. In the back, I saw a round of brand-new Audis. I didn’t know anything about cars, but I recognised the brand straightaway.

“Excuse me, ladies. Is either of you Julia Taylor?” a tall man approaching us asked when we started walking towards the lifts.

He startled us a little bit appearing out of nowhere. I had a feeling that he must have been waiting for us.

“That would be me,” I replied, straightening my skirt.

“If you please, follow me—you’re expected,” the man said. He was a werewolf. Paranormals could recognise each other; we sensed the magic and knew instantly if someone was a vampire, elf, fairy, or otherwise. Humans on the other hand, were clueless. They had no idea that we were living amongst them.

“This is so exciting,” Jennifer whispered once we were in the main entrance. I didn’t know what Jennifer meant. This place was giving me the creeps.

When we walked inside, I was taken aback by all the bare white walls and granite flooring. The La Caz Pharmaceutical lobby was clean and well-presented. A few more security guards were staring at computer screens. Vampires, elves, werewolves, shapeshifters, and a few wizards were walking in and out of the building. No one paid much attention to us. The werewolf with the name tag, “Todd” told us that our meeting would start in twenty minutes and showed us to the lift.

“How many people are currently employed here?” I asked him.

“I think over two thousand, miss,” he replied.

La Caz was doing a fantastic job and Rufus would definitely need to give me a raise if we signed him up today.

I exchanged a hopeful look with Jennifer, then followed Todd to the spacious reception area when we reached our floor.

“These ladies have a meeting with Mr. La Caz,” Todd announced. He nodded to us, then vanished into the lift.

We were asked to sit on the comfortable white leather sofas. The walls, floors, and even the furniture was all white. I thought that La Caz had to be some kind of stuck-up rich guy to like that colour so much. I didn’t know much about vampires; my kind tended to stay away from them. Apparently, our blood was very intoxicating, and they craved it more than human blood.

The receptionist had a large desk with at least three computer screens. She glanced at us for a few seconds after offering us refreshments. On my right, I saw the large white doors that most likely led to a conference room, and my stomach lurched again. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I just wanted to get this over with. I wished I’d eaten something other than that sandwich before I left; now I was not only nervous, but hungry as well. Jennifer was whispering about her swimming experience from the previous evening, when the large white doors opened, and a very tall werewolf emerged.

“Miss Julia Taylor and Jennifer Griffiths, Paranormal Personnel?” he asked the secretary. She nodded, then motioned for us to go ahead.

He noticed us and said, “Mr. La Caz is ready to begin.”

A cold chill spread across my shoulders. I was ready to throw up.

Jennifer and I looked at each other, then walked through the door. I thought that it was time to get this show on the road before I vomited and made an absolute fool of myself.",1,1768549716.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Phantom phone calls.

The phone kept ringing, and I was just about to pick up when Jen beat me to it.

“Welcome to Paranormal Personnel. Jennifer speaking, how may I help you?”

She put on her telephone voice and I found it fascinating that she sounded so different when she spoke to a client. Maybe Jen was an actress in another life. Who knew?

It was a busy day and I still had several more reports to finish, but I kept glancing back at the clock on the wall. I was consciously aware of my upcoming meeting with La Caz Pharmaceutical. I also remembered that I was supposed to text my cousin, Claudia. We were having dinner together later this evening and I was looking forward to catching up with her. We hadn’t seen each other for months.

“Hello? Hello?” Jennifer repeated a few times, sounding annoyed this time. Seconds later, she slammed the phone down, then furiously started typing away on her keyboard. This wasn’t our first dead call today.

“Another false alarm?” I asked, a little amused, although it really wasn’t funny. Over the past several weeks, we’d been getting dead phone calls at least three times a day. I reported it to Rufus, my regional manager, but he wasn’t very concerned about it. It seemed someone was trying to spook us, and it was becoming extremely irritating. Maybe it was time to speak to my dad about it.

“Yeah, it’s the third one today. I haven’t dumped anyone recently, so it’s none of my exes,” she responded, then the phone rang again.

“Welcome to Parano—”

“Hello, hello,” the deep, raspy voice on the other end of the line interrupted me, then my fingertips sparkled.

“My name is Julia. How can I help you today?” I asked more firmly. I didn’t like being interrupted.

“I just moved to London and I’m looking for a job. Would you have anything for a werewolf, love?” the voice asked, and I exhaled with relief. At least this guy was serious for a change.

“Of course, what are you looking for? Factory, security, or maybe you’re much more skilled—”

“Listen to me very carefully, love,” the man cut me off again. “I haven’t got much time, and they’re listening in.

Here's what I learned:

**General life tips:**

1. Choose a coach. Essentially this is anyone who can keep you accountable.
2. Avoid conflict by educating people around you about ADHD.
3. Listen to feedback from trusted others. Similarly, try to be more self-aware and practice self-awareness
4. Give yourself permission to be you and break free from conventional everything.
5. Establish external structure.
6. Make your environment in itself stimulating. If you fail again and again to maintain a routine or structure, make the routine and structure stimulating. One example is to try color coding or adding creativity/fun to whatever you do.
7. Understand the concept of O.H.I.O - only handle it once. Respond to things immediately. Do not have a to do pile or to do list of things to do later that can be done now. Whenever possible, tackle things immediately rather than putting them off.
8. Set yourself up for success. Create an environment that rewards you for doing the things you need to do.
9. Understand your limitations by expecting some level of ""failures"". Account for some percent of things that will inevitably not get done or not work out. Don't beat yourself up about it.
10. Always make deadlines.
11. Break down tasks into smaller tasks. Then give those sub-tasks sub-deadlines.
12. Become self-aware of when you learn best and the odd conditions that allow you to get things done.
13. It's okay to multi-task and often people with ADHD are better at doing multiple things at once. Talk on the phone while creating your plan for the day. Jog and plan your essay outline in your head.
14. Leave time for transitions. Understand that it takes us longer to switch between tasks.
15. Keep a notepad with you at all times
16. Set time aside every week/every day for doing something you enjoy doing or for ""wasting"".
17. Learn how to name your feelings and try ""I feel... because..."" statements.
18. Take a ""time out"". Exactly like children do.
19. Advocate for yourself and your needs.
20. Exercise regularly. Schedule it into your routine.
21. Schedule activities with friends. Set social deadlines. Have a social calendar.
22. Compliment others. Spend time noticing other people.
23. Keep things out. Visual cues are the strongest cues. Put things you need for work by the door. Keep papers that need to be handled on a bulletin board. Put your empty coffee mug out to remind you to start the coffee pot.
24. Make it fun. Every activity you don't like - make it fun instead.
25. Habit stacking - Once you get one habit going... add habits onto it to create a routine. (ie. In the morning you normally get coffee, get dressed, and leave. If you want to add daily planning, then add the habit ""After I get my coffee, I will sit down at my desk and plan my day for five minutes. After planning, I will get dressed and leave."")
26. Know what times of day your biological clock works. Night owls do things at night; early birds accomplish things in the morning.
27. Use technology to get smart with the way you do things. Be creative with solutions. Stop doing things the hard way and let computers do it for you. Don't be afraid to use kids stuff to solve your problems.
28. Similarly, stop doing things you don't need to and ask for help. Learn to delegate things to people that are trusted and able to help.
29. Become friends with defeat and failure. Stop beating yourself up over failing.
30. Learn to say no. Stop over-committing.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

**Chapter 1** 

The day we got our wolves, Nick and I slept together one last time. 

A breakup fuck. 

Afterward, he handed me a cigarette with practiced ease and chuckled. 

“My future Luna,” he said lightly, “would never be a she–wolf who smokes after sex.” 

My throat tightened. I asked him why. 

He answered calmly, almost gently. 

“Avery, only a pure, flawless she–wolf can stand beside me as my Luna.” 

I stayed silent for a long time. Then I cut off all contact with him and left his pack. 

When we met again, he had become my new boss. 

To avoid awkwardness, I submitted my resignation proactively. 

Instead, he cornered me in the CEO’s office. 

“It’s been five years,” he said, blocking my way. “How about another round?” 

I lowered my gaze. 

“No. I need to pick up my child from school.” 

The air went still. 

Nick froze. 

I tried to stand up from his lap, but his grip tightened, pinning me in place. 

The heat in his eyes dimmed. A faint crack appeared in his usual calm, controlled expression. 

Grinding his teeth, he asked, “How old is your child?” 

I said nothing at first. Then, quietly, “Three.” 

Three. 

Not four. 

And it had been five years since the night he rejected me.

That child was not his. 

Nick clearly understood that. 

I tried to stand again. This time, the large hand at my waist did not stop me. 

As I reached the door, he spoke again, suspicion creeping into his voice. 

“I remember your personnel file says you never sealed a mate bond.” 

I paused, steadied myself, and turned back calmly. 

“I signed a bond–sealing deal not long ago.” 

“Just signed,” he said slowly, “and your child is already three?” 

I nodded, completely composed. 

“Yes. We had the child before mate–bonding.” 

He did not respond. 

His sharp gaze dropped to the cheap bonding ring on my finger, and he let out a scoffing laugh. 

I did not feel embarrassed at all. 

I held my hand up openly, almost shoving it in his face. 

The moment I sensed his temper flaring, I turned and fled. 

That night, back home, I let out a long breath. 

Sometimes, lies were the most effective way to deal with unknown trouble. 

I had bought the ring yesterday at a small shop. 

Cheap and practical. 

I figured it was more than enough to erase whatever lingering affection Nick still had for me. 

Sure enough, my resignation was approved the very next day. 

HR personally came by in the afternoon to inform me that as long as I finished handover within a week, I could leave. 

Normally, resignations took a month.

Needing only one week made it obvious whose decision it was. 

I nodded and began transferring my workload to the intern. 

The new intern, Giselle, was sweet and enthusiastic. 

At the very least, while I was training her, I never paid for breakfast or afternoon coffee herself. 

As the workday neared its end, Giselle suddenly spoke up shyly. 

“Avery, can I leave a bit early tonight? My boyfriend asked me out to dinner.” 

I hesitated. 

Not because I could not let her go, but because I also needed to leave early to pick up Isabel. 

Seeing me silent for too long, she grew anxious, clasping her hands together and showering me with pleas. 

I could not help but laugh. 

“It’s fine. Go ahead.” 

She thanked me excitedly and began packing. 

“My boyfriend’s coming down now.” 

I blinked. 

“He works here too?” 

Giselle smiled mysteriously. 

“No, he’s actually…” 

Before she could finish, a low, familiar voice cut in. 

“Ready?”

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

**Entry 4 - The Beckoning Waves**

Well, diary, it's 2018, and many things have changed. No more landline phones. Being 55 is considered ancient (which I am). Instead of ordering from a whole-ass physical catalogue, now you can just go online and order anything. But there's one thing that has remained unchanged throughout these years: the lake.

Even sitting here sipping my coffee, I look out the window to the bay, and I see her. The morning light has just started, and Superior's beginning to gain some color. Between the dark blues lie pitch dark shades. It's about a 10-knot wind from the northwest, enough for some little waves to spring up. It's October, and I should be considering angling for trout. However, this is another fall in a long line of falls where I ignore the trout season.

Stare too long at the waves, and I risk it. The motion of the peaks and troughs and their cascading, soft crashes on the rocks can lure the eyes. But I keep looking, as I have many times before.

The black patches of water still hanging on the dark side of the waves are cursed things. After all of the lives lost to her, can she not let a bit of color through in the morning instead of clinging on? There are only another 10 minutes or so before the cold and dark are gone.

The dark of the lake is deep and boundless. The deepest point of Superior is 1300 feet. Even though I live in a bay, the illusion that light casts on the sea can make the shallowest of shoals seem like a trench. I shiver at the thought of how the cold must bite at you down there, and of the fish and other creatures that have maintained survival in the largest lake in the world.

When I had gone on some of the last few runs during my time on the *Mesabi Miner*, my parents both passed away. The doctors called it a freak heart attack. Neither of them had any cardiovascular problems, but hey, that's life. I believe it was '92, or was it '93? It was one of them, anyway. Both of them were 62, and I was only 30. I had no wife at the time or siblings. It was crushing.

Mental health is a son of a bitch, something that was not really talked about in my days. It was just something you had to bury, being a midwestern man. I had my struggles, and I kept them to myself. But my parents' deaths were what nearly drove me overboard, literally.

I had never felt such pain like that, and nobody told me how to deal with it. My mom and dad had left this world so abruptly, and I wasn't there to say goodbye. So, I did what lots of midwestern men do when there is pain inside their heads and hearts: drink. I was still on duty on the ship at the time. I had snuck a bottle of Jack into my quarters when we stopped in Ashland, WI, on our way to Houghton, MI. We loaded some iron ore pellets in the Chequamegon Bay and took off due northeast. We were dozens of miles offshore when I popped the bottle and began to drown my sorrows.

It was late, and I don't remember what time it was, but I fell over in my room and smashed what was left in the bottle; it must not have been very much. I certainly reacted like it was a lot. It was so bad that I fashioned a makeshift rope and tied it to my bunk. Obviously, it didn't work. So, I crashed onto my bed and passed out.

In my dream, I was on the deck of the *Mesabi Miner,* and nobody was at their stations. No seamen, no stewards, no mates, or captain. Suddenly, I felt the ship quake, like a subterranean plate had shifted and made Superior recoil. I looked over the starboard side and saw that the water was bending downwards, like an indent in the water was forming under the ship. I sprinted to the port side, same story. I was about to yell for someone, anyone, when the ship violently heaved and started rapidly sinking bow-first into the sea. Before I could scream, the water was above my head, and I was plummeting down into the deep with the ship. Oddly enough, she came to a peaceful rest at the bottom compared to her forceful dive. It was so dark, and beyond cold. I figured my body would never rise above the water; I'd be preserved down here in the freezing water. I could walk around just fine, however, and breathe just fine. That's when I felt her.

Folks say Superior never gives up her dead. Even in a dream, this was so.

I could feel the cold creeping in. I could feel the immense pressure of billions of gallons of water above my head. It was getting even darker, if that was possible down here. I looked around for a way out of this overhanging dread. There was a light in the wheelhouse! Somehow it stayed on? I made my way up to the house, climbing the stairs at a snail's pace as it was so cold. As I finally got there, I ripped the door open and fell inside. It was warm. There was no water in there. Then I woke up. I was back on the *Mesabi Miner*, it was well past midnight, and I was about to fall over the handrail, into the pitch-black water. I caught myself before I leaned any farther downward. Just as I came back out of the nightmare and back to the real world, I heard a woman's voice:

""Welcome home.""

Sometimes in the current day, I still hear this voice. I have caught myself at the water's edge a few times, dreaming or just completely unaware that I was getting closer. The waves will keep beckoning me forward until the day I die. One day, I might entertain the thought.",1,1768549130.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qe9qgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1qe9qgj/help_i_was_labeled_racist_in_my_grad_program_how/,Help! I Was Labeled Racist in My Grad Program - How Do I Recover Socially?,"**Background**

I (26M) am from a Western European country, doing an international one-year graduate program at a prestigious school in the U.S. I have been learning Chinese for 2 years, studied in China last year, and my dream is to move to either Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Singapore upon graduation. For context, I'm a bit socially awkward (maybe because I'm from a country where people are incredibly direct, maybe because I'm a nerd, maybe because I have diagnosed OCD and might have very mild autism), but always try to be nice to people and not to do any wrong.

**Orientation and beginning of Fall term**

During orientation, I befriended two Taiwanese students (≈30, M and F) on my floor. Let's call the guy ""X"" and the girl ""Y"". They were very close friends since undergrad. We'd spend time together most days and had dinner a few times, and they struck me as two really nice people. We spent time together most days, had dinner a few times, and they struck me as genuinely nice people. We weren’t close friends yet, but I felt we were becoming friends fairly quickly. We bought a rice cooker together. X happened to take the same class as me (in a subject related to his PhD), so I decided to sit next to him in the front row. There were a few awkward moments of which I didn't think much at the time:

\- The second or third class, the professor cold-called X. He gave a good answer, but not quite what the professor was looking for; the professor then asked me, and I gave the right answer.

\- We were given a small exercise to solve together in class. X kept insisting we solve the exercise in a way I simply knew was wrong. When the professor gave the solution, it turned out I was right.

\- During the course selection period, I had misunderstood a registration procedure and missed one class. When I told X this, he laughed and said that the procedure was rather straightforward if only I had read the course registration manual.

\- X told me I was moving my chair too often and seemed extremely annoyed. I apologised, and told him that if there's anything similar that annoys him, he should just tell me and I'll stop immediately.

**Lost election and rumors**

I ran for student rep towards the end of September, and lost. Alas, I later heard from several friends that X had been bad-mouthing me behind my back. He had told a least a dozen people that

* He is disgusted at how fat and ugly I am. (I'm a bulky lifter)
* I am too stupid to be class rep, based on the fact that I had misinterpreted a procedure during course registration, and urged people not to vote for me.
* I am extremely irritating in class, because of the way I move my chair (he kept saying this even after I had stopped moving it) and because I made him feel uncomfortable for allegedly manspreading. He called me a ""redneck"" with bad upbringing.
* I had never paid the Taiwanese girl back her 20$ for the rice cooker (not true, but I did forget to pay back my contribution of about 3$ for a bag of rice, which neither had ever asked for).
* I had sung an old Taiwanese political song from the 50s (true, but just because I thought it was archaic and it's message ridiculous), which he found disrespectful.
* He suspects I'm racist, because whenever I answer questions in class or discuss class material with him, I give off an air of superiority, as if trying to convey that I am somehow better than him because I'm European.

Around the same time, I saw that people close to X had become colder towards me, and I was getting fewer invitations to parties and social events. I love to talk about Chinese politics and practice my Mandarin, and I think Mandarin speakers interpret such conversations very differently once rumours go around that you are racist.

**First confrontation**

After class, I confronted X. I asked him how he could possibly have said such things which he must have known to be nonsense, especially the part about me being racist. He started sobbing and explained that he had been bullied in the past at uni. As a result, whenever he feels a minor or major frustration, he vents and releases his anger by picking on a certain person. He had chosen me as the object of his belittlement because when he's around me he ""feels threatened in his masculinity"" (his words), and said he was sorry for doing such a cowardly thing.

I was totally shocked by his honesty. I told X he cannot go through life with this type of loser mentality and needs to change his ways. I then hugged him and told him everything would be ok. We'd need to give it some time, but could become friends again.

I forgave him on one condition. The election was over, and the result couldn't be changed. But he had also given quite a few people an extremely bad impression of me, people that I was trying to network with and getting to know better. I didn't expect him to tell people about his motives for doing so, but I did make clear that he had to undo the damage he had caused and make absolutely clear that the rumours he had spread were nonsense, especially the part about me being racist. He agreed and promised to do so. We had a slightly awkward dinner together, and an awkward lunch or two, but I really tried to make things work and return to normality. Whenever I organised dessert night, I'd invite him along, although he never came.

**No change with the others**

Over the next few weeks, I saw that his friend group's attitudes towards me only hardened. There are a few I am on friendly terms with, but even they limited their social interactions. I barely saw Y anymore, though she did buy me a nice little birthday gift, which moved me. I tried reaching out to the others in X's friend group more, in part because I wanted to network and make friends, but also in part because I wanted to dispel the rumour that I was racist.

Not a single one even agreed to have coffee with me. Someone even proposed in October to have coffee after New Year because he was allegedly extremely busy. Sometimes, people I barely knew would actively shun me and pretend I didn't exist when I said hi to them. I didn't get invited to any social events at this point. Many of my friends, including my girlfriend, were also friends with them. Once news came out that we were dating, she also started to get excluded. Even if my friends didn't believe any of the rumours and knew them for a fact to be nonsense stopped inviting me to - say - their housewarming party or their potluck, because it would be socially awkward towards the people in that group who were also coming. I texted Y that I'd really appreciate it if she could ever include me in a social events; she told me that she had conveyed my wish to others, but that it is of course up to them whether to invite me. They never did.

**Second confrontation**

I asked someone in the group whom I’m on good terms with - let’s call him “Z” - why I was being shunned. He said that, even though he personally didn’t believe it, some people found my political discussions patronizing. He also told me that asking to be included in social events was poor social etiquette. He then gave me extensive social advice, which I actually found helpful, as I genuinely believe I can come across as undiplomatic and am not good at first impressions.

I thanked him and vaguely hinted - without giving details - that X and I had had a confrontation that might explain the situation. Later that night, acting in good faith, Z urged X to talk things out with me.

The next day (coincidentally the last day of the semester), X messaged me saying he was waiting in the library and had booked a room to talk. For the first half hour, he repeated much of the social advice Z had already given me. Then his tone shifted. He became openly hostile, listing both true and false examples of how no one could stand me.

He said he had initially tried to improve my reputation among the people he had lied to about me being racist, but quickly stopped feeling obligated because “they all hated me anyway.” He admitted that he knew I never had bad intentions toward him or the others, but said it was mentally and socially too exhausting for him to fix things - especially since I am not Asian, so that from a geographic point of view it is unlikely we would ever see each other again after the program ended, so what's the point?

From that point on, he said that he and his friends would completely ignore me, and that I should stop trying to interact with them.

**How to move forward?**

At this point, I've gathered that I have been played. I now know from others that after our first confrontation, he would just told people something similar to

>""Remember that classmate and my suspicion that he is racist? Just wanted to let you know we discussed it and hugged it out.""

No wonder that the group hates me. It didn't improve my reputation, but probably only worsened it.

I moved out of the dorm and am about to start a new semester. I don't want to be friends with them at this point, but *do* want to normalize the situation so that my girlfriend and I are not completely ostracized and can still be included in larger social events.

1qe9pd0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_u9PQGFC_Q,18 habits that (quietly) doubled my output,"**Problem: Constant Energy Depletion**

Instead of relying on stimulants, these habits align work with the body’s natural biological rhythms to prevent burnout.

• **Habit 1: Work in 90-Minute Sprints.**

◦ **Implementation:** Work in one focused 90-minute block, then take a **15 to 20-minute ""real"" break** away from screens, such as walking or staring at nothing.

◦ **Reasoning:** The brain operates on **ultradian rhythms**, moving in 90 to 120-minute waves of energy before crashing into a recovery phase. Working beyond this point causes **metabolic waste** to accumulate in the brain, spiking stress hormones and tanking performance.

• **Habit 2: Align with Your Chronotype.**

◦ **Implementation:** Schedule demanding analytical work during your natural peak alertness and save routine tasks for when you are tired.

◦ **Reasoning:** Only 15% of people are ""morning larks"" and 15% are ""night owls,"" while 70% fall in between. Fighting your natural clock results in working **twice as hard for half the results**.

• **Habit 3: Stop Mid-Flow on Purpose.**

◦ **Implementation:** Stop working when you still have energy and know exactly what comes next; leave notes to yourself for the following day.

◦ **Reasoning:** This Hemingway-inspired technique prevents you from having to **rebuild momentum from zero** the next morning, allowing you to start the day energized rather than exhausted.

**Problem 2: Bleeding Willpower on Trivial Decisions**

Every choice drains a finite mental ""battery."" These habits protect that energy for high-leverage tasks.

• **Habit 4: Make the ""Big Three"" Decisions at Night.**

◦ **Implementation:** Before bed, write down the three most important tasks for the next day.

◦ **Reasoning:** Most people waste their sharpest morning energy deciding what to do; writing them down **frontloads the decision** so that execution becomes automatic.

• **Habit 5: Automate Recurring Decisions.**

◦ **Implementation:** Create **default protocols** and put them on your calendar for daily tasks like workout times or meal menus.

◦ **Reasoning:** Recurring decisions are often ""disguised as new ones"". Automating them eliminates dozens of micro-decisions, freeing up brainpower for creative work.

• **Habit 6: Use ""If-Then"" Plans.**

◦ **Implementation:** Use the format: ""**If** \[situation\], **then** \[action\]"" (e.g., ""If it is 5:30 p.m., then I go to the gym"").

◦ **Reasoning:** This specificity cuts through procrastination by removing ambiguity; when there is **zero ambiguity, there is zero decision fatigue**.

• **Habit 7: Define the ""Next Action"" Immediately.**

◦ **Implementation:** Spend 30 seconds at the end of a task writing the **exact physical next step**.

◦ **Reasoning:** This habit has a **30x return**; a 30-second note saves 15 minutes of ""figuring it out"" when you next sit down to work.

**Problem 3: Mental Clutter from Unfinished Tasks**

These habits address the **Zeigarnic effect**, where the brain remembers incomplete tasks more vividly than completed ones.

• **Habit 8: ""Touch It Once"" or Not at All.**

◦ **Implementation:** Either handle a task (like an email) completely or do not touch it until you have the context to finish it.

◦ **Reasoning:** Every time you start a task without finishing, you create **""Zeigarnic tension""** or an unnecessary mental tab that drains focus.

• **Habit 9: Start Priority Tasks for Just 5 Minutes.**

◦ **Implementation:** When avoiding a major task, commit to working on it for only five minutes.

◦ **Reasoning:** This uses the Zeigarnic effect in your favour; by starting, you open a loop the **brain naturally wants to close**, providing free ""background processing"".

• **Habit 10: Use a Completion Ritual.**

◦ **Implementation:** Mark tasks as complete physically or verbally and close your laptop with intention.

◦ **Reasoning:** Without a clear signal, the brain keeps tasks **partially open**, creating unnecessary mental weight.

• **Habit 11: Perform a Nightly Brain Dump.**

◦ **Implementation:** Spend five minutes before bed writing down every worry or idea.

◦ **Reasoning:** This stops the Zeigarnic effect from running all night, **closing open loops** so the brain can rest instead of anxiously tracking tasks.

**Problem 4: Fragmented Focus**

Constant switching between tasks can waste up to **40% of productive time**.

• **Habit 12: Batch Tasks by Energy Type.**

◦ **Implementation:** Group tasks into categories: **High Energy** (creative/strategic), **Medium Energy** (emails/meetings), and **Low Energy** (mindless admin).

◦ **Reasoning:** Batching prevents you from ""yanking"" your brain between different mental modes, which preserves focus.

• **Habit 13: Use Music as a Focus Trigger.**

◦ **Implementation:** Use dedicated playlists: instrumental for deep work, upbeat for routine tasks, and silence for creative work.

◦ **Reasoning:** This leverages **Pavlovian conditioning**; after a few weeks, the music automatically triggers the brain to shift into the correct mode.

**Problem 5: Negative Internal Narratives**

Perception often controls your output more than reality does.

• **Habit 14: Talk to Yourself in the Third Person.**

◦ **Implementation:** Refer to yourself by name during self-talk when feeling stuck or panicked.

◦ **Reasoning:** This switches the brain from **""emotion mode"" to ""problem-solving mode,""** allowing you to access your rational brain as if you were advising a friend.

• **Habit 15: Balance Optimism with Obstacle Planning.**

◦ **Implementation:** Imagine the positive outcome, then deliberately plan ""if-then"" solutions for the obstacles you will likely face.

◦ **Reasoning:** Purely positive visualisation can trick the brain into thinking it has **already succeeded**, causing it to stop trying.

• **Habit 16: Ship at 80%.**

◦ **Implementation:** Embrace the mantra that ""done and shipped beats perfect and stuck"".

◦ **Reasoning:** This counters the **""spotlight effect""**—the false belief that others are scrutinising your work as intensely as you are. Real progress comes from iteration based on feedback, not polishing in isolation.

**Problem 6: Vanishing Motivation**

These habits make motivation automatic rather than relying on depletable willpower.

• **Habit 17: Temptation Bundling.**

◦ **Implementation:** Pair a ""should"" task (like folding laundry) with a ""want"" task (like listening to a favourite podcast).

◦ **Reasoning:** Research shows this can increase follow-through by up to 51% because you are **rewarding yourself during the task**, not after.

• **Habit 18: Vary Your Rewards.**

◦ **Implementation:** Randomise your rewards (e.g., a coffee, a walk, or nothing) so the brain does not know what is coming.

◦ **Reasoning:** Based on slot machine logic, **variable rewards are more addictive** and compelling than consistent ones, keeping the brain curious and engaged.",1,1768548925.0,CommitAndCreate,0,1.0,False

Whether it be screaming, honking, shouted words that can either be catcalling or things I can’t make out — happens nearly every time. It happened to me a huge amount of times as a child, teenager, and now as an adult.

I’m really upset with others; I don’t think they’re trying to make me feel on-edge or humiliated… but when it happens I feel as if I’m being made fun of, and it tends to ruin the whole experience. When it comes from men, I assume it’s suggestive or bullying, and when it comes from women, I assume it’s just bullying.

At one point I just resorted to walking around my neighborhood, because why on earth would someone going 15 mph be so foul? Of course, while I was ruminating about the possibility of being harassed, a car drove by, and a girl my age with her window rolled down screamed at the top of her lungs before driving off.

Now I just don’t go on walks much anymore. Sometimes I’ll drive to the nearby park to walk, but I tend to prefer walking to destinations I want to get to then back. Like if I’m craving a coffee and I’m not busy, I’d love to walk 15 minutes to a cafe then back home… it feels rewarding.

I have Depression and going on walks was one of the only ways I felt somewhat productive during the day without being too much work, but now whenever I try I’m riddled with anxiety the whole time. Not only walks, but anything where I’m walking on foot and there are passing cars… I’m so anxious. Basic things like pumping gas at the gas station, walking from my car to the store in a parking lot, just washing my car in my driveway… I try to avoid it all.

I’m honestly just really sad. I miss walking places without being on edge the whole time thinking: “Is the next car going to do something scary?” I feel like I can’t even listen to music in my headphones because I feel unsafe, like I have to hear what’s happening around me because it feels so hostile. Also, just walking in front of parked cars now — I immediately have the intrusive thought that they’re going to honk at me, which as an autistic person is extremely upsetting because I have sensitive ears.

I don’t really know how to handle this anxiety. I don’t think people will stop, and I don’t know how to be less anxious about it. People scoff at me when I tell them it happens every damn time I go on walks, but I swear to god I’m cursed or something. Perhaps I just look like an easy target, and maybe I am — because when this happens it makes me feel less than human.",1,1768548879.0,women,0,1.0,False

while resting i saw this odd dude na may iced coffee na palapit dun sa windowsill where my lifting straps were. i wouldn't normally assume na magnanakaw yung isang tao unless proven guilty naman. i was gonna start my last set when he intentionally put his drink beside my lifting straps and kept an eye on me when i lifted the dumbells. bago ko simulan yung set ko ""inusog"" nya yung lifting straps from his right side to his left hand side. after seeing my reaction na nakatitig parin ako thru the mirror he took his drink and left to do his workout which was far from the windowsill (lat pulldown in the middle of the gym). 

is it safe to assume that he was planning on taking my lifting straps? for more context he didn't do not one workout there kahit lahat ng benches unoccupied. and walang gamit don sa windowsill kaya there was no reason para ""iusog"" yung straps ko

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Harper POV

The August sun hits like a spotlight when I step off the bus, and for a second, it’s hard to tell if the heat prickling under my skin is nerves or excitement. Probably both.

College. A new start. A clean page.

No one here knows who I was in high school — the quiet girl with the perfect GPA and the predictable life. Here, I get to decide who I am.

The student tour guide waves a clipboard in the air. “Welcome to Hartwell University! Let’s get started over by the quad!”

I adjust the strap of my bag and fall in with the crowd, doing my best to look like I belong. The campus smells like fresh-cut grass and coffee, and everyone’s talking over each other — new roommates, majors, dorms, everything at once.

And then I see him.

Of course I do.

Logan Shaw.

He’s standing a few rows back, hair still that messy brown that always looks like it should’ve fallen in his eyes but never quite does. Same careless grin. Same stupid confidence.

He’s got a hockey duffel slung over one shoulder, and even from here I can see how his arms have filled out since high school. He laughs at something a teammate says, loud and easy, like the world’s already decided to make room for him.

My heart drops, just a little.

Because for a second — only a second — I’m back in that hallway at West Ridge High, listening to him brag about skipping prom for “playoffs,” like feelings were a distraction, like people were just background noise to his goals.

Guess some things don’t change.

I square my shoulders and look away.

The tour guide points toward the bell tower, saying something about its history since the 1800s. Half the group’s listening. The other half is either texting or staring at the girl with the clipboard. Typical.

When I glance back again, Logan’s looking right at me.

Not by accident. Not even pretending it’s by accident.

His gaze is steady — curious, almost like he’s trying to remember if he’s supposed to know me. Then he smiles, small and lazy, like he does remember, and I instantly hate that it still does something to my stomach.

I tear my eyes away and focus on the map in my hands.

He’s just a guy. Just another athlete with a swagger and a scholarship. And I’m not the girl who waits around for people like him anymore.

By the time the tour ends, my nerves have settled into something steadier — determination, maybe. I can already picture the next four years: classes, sorority rush, internships. A life that’s mine.

But as I leave the group, I hear that laugh again — deep, confident, exactly the same as it used to sound echoing down locker-lined halls.

I glance over my shoulder.

Logan’s surrounded by new teammates already, his hand gesturing wildly as he talks. Girls drift past, pretending not to stare. He doesn’t notice me — or maybe he does and just doesn’t care.

Either way, I tell myself I’m relieved.

Because this is my new start. And Logan Shaw? He’s just part of my past.

Even if, for some reason I can’t explain, the thought of him still makes my pulse skip like it’s stuck between wanting to run away and wanting to look again.

——

Logan POV

The dorm smells like sweat and floor cleaner — that weird mix that somehow makes it feel like home.

My bag hits the floor with a thud, hockey sticks rattling against the wall. The room’s small, just two beds, two desks, one window that doesn’t open all the way. Nothing special, but it’s freedom.

Cole Matthews is already there, sitting backward on his desk chair, tapping a hockey puck against the wall like it’s a nervous tic. He looks up when I walk in. Blond hair, cocky grin, and shoulders that say he lives in the gym.

“Shaw, right?” he asks.

“Yeah. Logan.”

“Cole.” He grins, tossing the puck into the air and catching it. “You play defense?”

“Yup. You?”

“Center. Looks like we’ll be keeping each other alive this season.”

He stands, offering a handshake that’s a little too firm — the kind of thing athletes do when they’re sizing each other up. I match it.

Instant competition. Instant respect.

⸻

Later, I follow him to the rink. The place is freezing and loud — metal scraping, coaches barking, pucks slamming into boards. Heaven.

Coach Rourke blows his whistle the second we step on the ice. “Freshmen, line up!”

I knew college hockey would be brutal, but I wasn’t ready for this. Every sprint feels like punishment, every drill a reminder that being good in high school means nothing here.

By the end, my legs are shaking. My lungs burn. Cole’s grinning like a maniac.

“Still alive?” he asks.

“Barely,” I manage.

“Good. Means you did it right.”

We both laugh, and just like that, I know he’s going to be the closest thing I’ve got to a brother on this team.

⸻

By the time orientation rolls around, we’re walking into the crowd like we own the place.

We don’t, not yet. But someday, we will.

The tour guide’s this perky senior with a clipboard and a too-bright smile, talking about campus landmarks and alumni donors. None of it sticks. My head’s still half on the rink — the rhythm of blades on ice, the echo of the whistle.

Then, out of nowhere, I see her.

Harper Lane.

My brain stalls for a second.

She’s standing near the front of the group, sunlight catching her hair, posture straight like she’s got something to prove. She’s different — confident, sharper, not the soft-spoken girl I remember from back home.

I nudge Cole. “That’s someone I know.”

He glances her way, then back at me. “You dated?”

I shake my head. “Nah. Just knew her.”

He smirks. “You want to know her, though.”

I grin. “Maybe.”

She looks over her shoulder then — not by accident. Our eyes meet. There’s a flicker of recognition, followed by a look that’s hard to read. Not shy. Not impressed either.

That’s new.

Most girls smile back. She just…measures me, then turns away like she’s already decided I’m not worth her time.

It stings more than I want to admit.

⸻

After the tour, the crowd scatters toward the dining hall. I spot her near the edge of the group, phone in hand, pretending not to look around.

I walk up, hands in my pockets. “Harper Lane. Didn’t think you’d end up here.”

She looks up, expression cool. “Neither did I.”

“Guess West Ridge breeds overachievers.”

“Guess so.”

There’s this pause, tight but not uncomfortable. The kind that feels like something could happen if one of us wanted it to.

I give her a half-smile. “You rushing?”

“Maybe.”

“You’ll fit right in. You’ve got that whole sorority thing down.”

Her eyebrow lifts. “And you’ve got the hockey player ego. Nice to see nothing’s changed.”

I laugh. Can’t help it. “You always did know how to take the fun out of flirting.”

She smiles, but it’s the polite kind. “You always did mistake arrogance for fun.”

Then she walks off before I can come up with a comeback.

Cole finds me a minute later. “Strike out already?”

I shrug. “Didn’t swing.”

He laughs. “Sure you didn’t.”

But as we head back toward the dorms, I keep glancing over my shoulder — half expecting to see her again, half hoping I don’t.

Because something about the way she looked at me — like she saw right through the act — makes me feel more exposed than all the ice in the world ever could.

# Chapter 1

(4 Years Later)

Logan POV

The house leans a little to the left, like even it’s hungover from last semester. Peeling white paint, porch railing that wobbles when you breathe near it, and a dented mailbox with a faded Hartwell Hockey sticker still clinging to the side. Someone spray-painted ICE HOUSE ’24 across the steps last spring, and the blue letters have already cracked from too many storms.

It’s ugly, but it’s ours.

I drop my duffel onto the porch, stretch, and grin up at the sagging roofline. “Miss me, Ice House?”

The door’s unlocked—of course it is. It always is. Inside smells like beer, sweat, detergent, and a little bit of victory. The perfect cocktail of college glory.

“Shaw!”

Cole Matthews’ voice booms from the kitchen before I even hit the living room. He appears a second later, a case of beer balanced on one arm, his captain’s jacket hanging open. Blond hair messy, sunglasses still on even though the sun’s dipping low. Typical.

He drops the case onto the counter with a thud. “You look like a man ready to ruin his GPA again.”

“Tradition,” I say, and he laughs the same deep laugh I’ve known since freshman year.

The living room hasn’t changed: scuffed floors, a sagging couch rescued from the curb, our championship banners pinned crooked above the fireplace. The moose head someone stole from the campus lodge still wears its crooked plastic crown. Someone added sunglasses to it this summer. Nice touch.

Cole tosses me a can. “To senior year.”

I crack it open, foam spilling over my fingers. “To leaving a legacy.”

We clink cans. The sound echoes through the old house like a battle cry.

⸻

By the time the sun starts bleeding orange through the windows, the house is already shaking. The returning guys show up first, then the new recruits, then half the student body. Move-in day always turns into a full-blown party here. It’s a rule as sacred as icing calls and team loyalty.

The bass from the speaker rattles my ribs. Someone’s chanting the fight song in the kitchen. A group of first-years stand near the stairs, wide-eyed, probably wondering if they’ve joined a cult or a hockey team.

Cole shoves through the crowd to my side. “We’ve been gone three months and they still remember who runs this place.”

“They’d better,” I say. “We built it.”

He smirks. “Careful, co-captain, that ego’s showing.”

“Says the guy wearing his C to a kegger.”

He looks down at his jacket, grins. “Leadership, baby.”

⸻

I head out to the porch for a breather. The air smells like grass and smoke from the grill someone dragged into the yard. Across the lawn, the Greek houses are lighting up with their own parties. You can always tell the difference—frat parties sound like competition; sorority ones sound like strategy meetings with music.

Cole joins me, beer in hand. “You think scouts’ll be around this year?”

“Coach said a few. NHL’s always sniffing for new blood.”

“You’ll get picked up.”

“Yeah?”

He nods. “If you stop getting distracted.”

I snort. “Define distracted.”

He gestures toward the yard where a group of girls in matching pastel dresses are crossing the street toward us. “That.”

The Alpha Chi girls. Sorority royalty. They move like they own the campus. And leading them—dark hair, posture straight, expression cool—is Harper Lane.

For a heartbeat I forget to breathe.

Four years ago, she was shy, bookish, the girl everyone liked but nobody really noticed. Now she looks… different. Not just confident—commanding. Like she figured out exactly who she is while the rest of us were still playing at it.

Cole follows my gaze. “You know her?”

“Yeah.”

“She looks like trouble.”

“She is trouble,” I say, and I’m not sure if I mean it as a warning or a compliment.

⸻

The girls fan out across the lawn, greeting people, laughing, doing the yearly “welcome circuit.” It’s part tradition, part diplomacy. The Ice House and the sororities trade event invites and charity collabs every fall. The girls know it; we know it. The whole thing’s politics disguised as fun.

Harper doesn’t play it that way. She talks to a few people, polite, poised, but there’s distance in her eyes—as if she’s keeping a ledger of who deserves her time.

She turns her head and spots me.

That quick flick of recognition hits like a body-check. Her gaze lingers for a beat—then she gives the smallest nod, professional, detached, the kind of nod you give an acquaintance at a meeting.

Then she looks past me.

Something in my chest twists. I laugh it off, take another sip. “Still not my type,” I mutter.

Cole grins. “Keep telling yourself that.”

⸻

Hours later, the crowd’s thinning but the music’s still loud. Someone’s yelling for another round of beer pong in the kitchen; a couple’s making out on the stairs; it’s chaos, the good kind.

I’m leaning against the porch railing when the Alpha Chi girls finally start to leave. Most of them are giggling, shoes in hand. Harper’s the last one out, her phone glowing in the dark as she checks messages.

I can’t help myself. “Didn’t think sorority presidents did house inspections personally.”

She looks up, surprised for half a second, then amused. “You really turned this place into a legend.”

“Wasn’t hard. Low standards.”

Her mouth curves. “Still charming.”

“Still pretending you don’t like it.”

She tilts her head, studying me the way she used to study exam questions—looking for the trick answer. “Still sure the world revolves around you, huh?”

I grin. “Only on game nights.”

The porch light flickers between us, and for a moment, the noise from inside fades. She smells like vanilla and something sharper—confidence, maybe.

“You ever gonna grow up, Shaw?” she asks quietly.

I shrug. “Not planning on it.”

Her smile is small, genuine, and gone before I can catch it. “Good luck with that.”

She steps off the porch, heels clicking against the pavement. Her friends call for her down the block, and she waves without looking back.

Cole appears beside me, leaning on the railing. “You gonna keep staring or go after her?”

“Neither.”

“Liar.”

Maybe. But I stay where I am, watching the shape of her disappear into the glow of the streetlights.

⸻

Inside, someone shouts my name—another game starting, another night to waste before the real season begins. I grab another beer, but the fizz tastes flat.

Four years of parties, hookups, noise. All of it’s supposed to feel easy by now.

So why does one conversation with Harper Lane make everything else feel like background static?

I tell myself it’s nostalgia. Familiar face, old memory, nothing more.

But the lie doesn’t stick.

Because when I close my eyes, all I can see is the way she looked at me—steady, unimpressed, unshaken.

And for the first time in a long time, I feel like the ice beneath my feet isn’t nearly as solid as it used to be.",1,1768548285.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

The tour guide points toward the bell tower, saying something about its history since the 1800s. Half the group’s listening. The other half is either texting or staring at the girl with the clipboard. Typical.

When I glance back again, Logan’s looking right at me.

Not by accident. Not even pretending it’s by accident.

His gaze is steady — curious, almost like he’s trying to remember if he’s supposed to know me. Then he smiles, small and lazy, like he does remember, and I instantly hate that it still does something to my stomach.

I tear my eyes away and focus on the map in my hands.

He’s just a guy. Just another athlete with a swagger and a scholarship. And I’m not the girl who waits around for people like him anymore.

By the time the tour ends, my nerves have settled into something steadier — determination, maybe. I can already picture the next four years: classes, sorority rush, internships. A life that’s mine.

But as I leave the group, I hear that laugh again — deep, confident, exactly the same as it used to sound echoing down locker-lined halls.

I glance over my shoulder.

Logan’s surrounded by new teammates already, his hand gesturing wildly as he talks. Girls drift past, pretending not to stare. He doesn’t notice me — or maybe he does and just doesn’t care.

Either way, I tell myself I’m relieved.

Because this is my new start. And Logan Shaw? He’s just part of my past.

Even if, for some reason I can’t explain, the thought of him still makes my pulse skip like it’s stuck between wanting to run away and wanting to look again.

——

Logan POV

The dorm smells like sweat and floor cleaner — that weird mix that somehow makes it feel like home.

My bag hits the floor with a thud, hockey sticks rattling against the wall. The room’s small, just two beds, two desks, one window that doesn’t open all the way. Nothing special, but it’s freedom.

Cole Matthews is already there, sitting backward on his desk chair, tapping a hockey puck against the wall like it’s a nervous tic. He looks up when I walk in. Blond hair, cocky grin, and shoulders that say he lives in the gym.

“Shaw, right?” he asks.

“Yeah. Logan.”

“Cole.” He grins, tossing the puck into the air and catching it. “You play defense?”

“Yup. You?”

“Center. Looks like we’ll be keeping each other alive this season.”

He stands, offering a handshake that’s a little too firm — the kind of thing athletes do when they’re sizing each other up. I match it.

Instant competition. Instant respect.

⸻

Later, I follow him to the rink. The place is freezing and loud — metal scraping, coaches barking, pucks slamming into boards. Heaven.

Coach Rourke blows his whistle the second we step on the ice. “Freshmen, line up!”

I knew college hockey would be brutal, but I wasn’t ready for this. Every sprint feels like punishment, every drill a reminder that being good in high school means nothing here.

By the end, my legs are shaking. My lungs burn. Cole’s grinning like a maniac.

“Still alive?” he asks.

“Barely,” I manage.

“Good. Means you did it right.”

We both laugh, and just like that, I know he’s going to be the closest thing I’ve got to a brother on this team.

⸻

By the time orientation rolls around, we’re walking into the crowd like we own the place.

We don’t, not yet. But someday, we will.

The tour guide’s this perky senior with a clipboard and a too-bright smile, talking about campus landmarks and alumni donors. None of it sticks. My head’s still half on the rink — the rhythm of blades on ice, the echo of the whistle.

Then, out of nowhere, I see her.

Harper Lane.

My brain stalls for a second.

She’s standing near the front of the group, sunlight catching her hair, posture straight like she’s got something to prove. She’s different — confident, sharper, not the soft-spoken girl I remember from back home.

I nudge Cole. “That’s someone I know.”

He glances her way, then back at me. “You dated?”

I shake my head. “Nah. Just knew her.”

He smirks. “You want to know her, though.”

I grin. “Maybe.”

She looks over her shoulder then — not by accident. Our eyes meet. There’s a flicker of recognition, followed by a look that’s hard to read. Not shy. Not impressed either.

That’s new.

Most girls smile back. She just…measures me, then turns away like she’s already decided I’m not worth her time.

It stings more than I want to admit.

⸻

After the tour, the crowd scatters toward the dining hall. I spot her near the edge of the group, phone in hand, pretending not to look around.

I walk up, hands in my pockets. “Harper Lane. Didn’t think you’d end up here.”

She looks up, expression cool. “Neither did I.”

“Guess West Ridge breeds overachievers.”

“Guess so.”

There’s this pause, tight but not uncomfortable. The kind that feels like something could happen if one of us wanted it to.

I give her a half-smile. “You rushing?”

“Maybe.”

“You’ll fit right in. You’ve got that whole sorority thing down.”

Her eyebrow lifts. “And you’ve got the hockey player ego. Nice to see nothing’s changed.”

I laugh. Can’t help it. “You always did know how to take the fun out of flirting.”

She smiles, but it’s the polite kind. “You always did mistake arrogance for fun.”

Then she walks off before I can come up with a comeback.

Cole finds me a minute later. “Strike out already?”

I shrug. “Didn’t swing.”

He laughs. “Sure you didn’t.”

But as we head back toward the dorms, I keep glancing over my shoulder — half expecting to see her again, half hoping I don’t.

Because something about the way she looked at me — like she saw right through the act — makes me feel more exposed than all the ice in the world ever could.

# Chapter 1

(4 Years Later)

Logan POV

The house leans a little to the left, like even it’s hungover from last semester. Peeling white paint, porch railing that wobbles when you breathe near it, and a dented mailbox with a faded Hartwell Hockey sticker still clinging to the side. Someone spray-painted ICE HOUSE ’24 across the steps last spring, and the blue letters have already cracked from too many storms.

It’s ugly, but it’s ours.

I drop my duffel onto the porch, stretch, and grin up at the sagging roofline. “Miss me, Ice House?”

The door’s unlocked—of course it is. It always is. Inside smells like beer, sweat, detergent, and a little bit of victory. The perfect cocktail of college glory.

“Shaw!”

Cole Matthews’ voice booms from the kitchen before I even hit the living room. He appears a second later, a case of beer balanced on one arm, his captain’s jacket hanging open. Blond hair messy, sunglasses still on even though the sun’s dipping low. Typical.

He drops the case onto the counter with a thud. “You look like a man ready to ruin his GPA again.”

“Tradition,” I say, and he laughs the same deep laugh I’ve known since freshman year.

The living room hasn’t changed: scuffed floors, a sagging couch rescued from the curb, our championship banners pinned crooked above the fireplace. The moose head someone stole from the campus lodge still wears its crooked plastic crown. Someone added sunglasses to it this summer. Nice touch.

Cole tosses me a can. “To senior year.”

I crack it open, foam spilling over my fingers. “To leaving a legacy.”

We clink cans. The sound echoes through the old house like a battle cry.

⸻

By the time the sun starts bleeding orange through the windows, the house is already shaking. The returning guys show up first, then the new recruits, then half the student body. Move-in day always turns into a full-blown party here. It’s a rule as sacred as icing calls and team loyalty.

The bass from the speaker rattles my ribs. Someone’s chanting the fight song in the kitchen. A group of first-years stand near the stairs, wide-eyed, probably wondering if they’ve joined a cult or a hockey team.

Cole shoves through the crowd to my side. “We’ve been gone three months and they still remember who runs this place.”

“They’d better,” I say. “We built it.”

He smirks. “Careful, co-captain, that ego’s showing.”

“Says the guy wearing his C to a kegger.”

He looks down at his jacket, grins. “Leadership, baby.”

⸻

I head out to the porch for a breather. The air smells like grass and smoke from the grill someone dragged into the yard. Across the lawn, the Greek houses are lighting up with their own parties. You can always tell the difference—frat parties sound like competition; sorority ones sound like strategy meetings with music.

Cole joins me, beer in hand. “You think scouts’ll be around this year?”

“Coach said a few. NHL’s always sniffing for new blood.”

“You’ll get picked up.”

“Yeah?”

He nods. “If you stop getting distracted.”

I snort. “Define distracted.”

He gestures toward the yard where a group of girls in matching pastel dresses are crossing the street toward us. “That.”

The Alpha Chi girls. Sorority royalty. They move like they own the campus. And leading them—dark hair, posture straight, expression cool—is Harper Lane.

For a heartbeat I forget to breathe.

Four years ago, she was shy, bookish, the girl everyone liked but nobody really noticed. Now she looks… different. Not just confident—commanding. Like she figured out exactly who she is while the rest of us were still playing at it.

Cole follows my gaze. “You know her?”

“Yeah.”

“She looks like trouble.”

“She is trouble,” I say, and I’m not sure if I mean it as a warning or a compliment.

⸻

The girls fan out across the lawn, greeting people, laughing, doing the yearly “welcome circuit.” It’s part tradition, part diplomacy. The Ice House and the sororities trade event invites and charity collabs every fall. The girls know it; we know it. The whole thing’s politics disguised as fun.

Harper doesn’t play it that way. She talks to a few people, polite, poised, but there’s distance in her eyes—as if she’s keeping a ledger of who deserves her time.

She turns her head and spots me.

That quick flick of recognition hits like a body-check. Her gaze lingers for a beat—then she gives the smallest nod, professional, detached, the kind of nod you give an acquaintance at a meeting.

Then she looks past me.

Something in my chest twists. I laugh it off, take another sip. “Still not my type,” I mutter.

Cole grins. “Keep telling yourself that.”

⸻

Hours later, the crowd’s thinning but the music’s still loud. Someone’s yelling for another round of beer pong in the kitchen; a couple’s making out on the stairs; it’s chaos, the good kind.

I’m leaning against the porch railing when the Alpha Chi girls finally start to leave. Most of them are giggling, shoes in hand. Harper’s the last one out, her phone glowing in the dark as she checks messages.

I can’t help myself. “Didn’t think sorority presidents did house inspections personally.”

She looks up, surprised for half a second, then amused. “You really turned this place into a legend.”

“Wasn’t hard. Low standards.”

Her mouth curves. “Still charming.”

“Still pretending you don’t like it.”

She tilts her head, studying me the way she used to study exam questions—looking for the trick answer. “Still sure the world revolves around you, huh?”

I grin. “Only on game nights.”

The porch light flickers between us, and for a moment, the noise from inside fades. She smells like vanilla and something sharper—confidence, maybe.

“You ever gonna grow up, Shaw?” she asks quietly.

I shrug. “Not planning on it.”

Her smile is small, genuine, and gone before I can catch it. “Good luck with that.”

She steps off the porch, heels clicking against the pavement. Her friends call for her down the block, and she waves without looking back.

Cole appears beside me, leaning on the railing. “You gonna keep staring or go after her?”

“Neither.”

“Liar.”

Maybe. But I stay where I am, watching the shape of her disappear into the glow of the streetlights.

⸻

Inside, someone shouts my name—another game starting, another night to waste before the real season begins. I grab another beer, but the fizz tastes flat.

Four years of parties, hookups, noise. All of it’s supposed to feel easy by now.

So why does one conversation with Harper Lane make everything else feel like background static?

I tell myself it’s nostalgia. Familiar face, old memory, nothing more.

But the lie doesn’t stick.

Because when I close my eyes, all I can see is the way she looked at me—steady, unimpressed, unshaken.

And for the first time in a long time, I feel like the ice beneath my feet isn’t nearly as solid as it used to be.",1,1768548257.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1768547955.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Sagen er, at jeg er meget utilfreds i min nuværende job. Jeg har tænkt at skifte jobbet i lang tid, men har kun været klar til at være proaktiv i det siden sidste uge. Jeg har søgt et job ‘the classic way’ etc etc.

Men, der er en firma jeg drømmer at arbejde hos. Jeg har erfaring præcis i deres niche industri, dog ikke så lang (har 1-2 år af fultid erfaring + et par år studentmedarbejder). Og tilfædeligt, er der også en jeg kender lidt (har snakket en gang eller to, vi er connected på Linkedin og andre sociale medier, har læst det samme men ikke på samme årgang) der arbejder der.

Selvfølgelig har jeg hørt mange gang at man har den største chance for at få job gennem sit netværk i stedet for at søge på jobopslag… Så jeg overvejer at invitere personen til en ‘Linkedin coffee’. Men jeg har aldrig gjort det før!!!

Hvordan inviterer jeg ham? Hvad snakker jeg om? Mere industrien/hans firma/nyheder? Hvor ‘aggressiv’ kan jeg tillade mig at være? Min ven, der har erfaring med Linkedin kaffemøder, har sagt til mig at jeg skal aldrig navne højt at jeg er interesseret i et job hos dem… Har i nogle tips and tricks til den slags møde?",0,1768547886.0,dkkarriere,4,0.33,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

1qe9b57,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonut26/comments/1qe9b57/nofap_strategy_that_works_need_to_get_your/,"Nofap strategy that works - Need to get your dopamine from other sources, and then moderate your baseline.","Like every other addiction, dopamine baseline levels are peaked in a fap addict. We chase the high (edging) for many hours flooding our brains with dopamine. Over time, the baseline needed to maintain this high gets higher and higher, and we keep going after worse stuff or getting high for longer. We get all our dopamine this way - so, there's no motivation to do anything else. Depression and spiralling follows.

So, the first three days of nofap are crucial where you need to still get your dopamine. This maybe through other unhealthy means - emotional eating, just binge watching, video games, etc., This maybe unpopular opinion, but I would say this is okay for the first three days upto the first 7 days. This may look like replacing one addiction with another - but it's not. There is no end to fapping and flooding your brain with dopamine. But you can only binge eat so much (video games different though).

Once you've gone past the 3 day mark, your brain would already feel much clearer, and you would start making more healthy choices. Going cold turky from every addiction at the same time hasn't helped me at all. From the 4th day onwards, you find other sources of dopamine and other feel good hormones. A warm coffee on a cold day in sunlight on a park bench sometimes just feel blissful. Going for a long walk and then crashing on the couch feels blissful. Feeling the first hit of cold water hit the back of your throat after a long walk feels blissful. You then start chasing these things. And then the complexities of life (which are absolutely absent in our fantasy land of fapping) hits us in the head. We then deal with that - chasing these blissful moments when and where we can.

I have had a 90 day streak before and failed. I am 33 years old, and have been doing nofap for past few years. I struggled to get past 3 days on my whole of first year. Last year, I might have fapped maybe 10 times. Was it perfect? No. Am I advocating fapping 10 times - absolutely not. I am just saying it is important to be kind to yourself - while not spoiling yourself in the process. Once you hit that nice balance there is no stopping you.

I haven't hit the balance myself, but just knowing that the balance is there, and knowing that the balance is achievable itself is helping me to chase that balance. This is also one meta-way of me getting my dopamine.

TL;DR - First 3 days of nofap - get your dopamine from other sources. After that, get that dopamine from more healthy sources, and slowly moderate your dopamine baseline till you find your balance.

As for the rest of my slate, here’s what we had tonight:

 

**Picks (2/4)** 

\-UTA Mammoth ML (-110) ✅

\-BOS Celtics -2.5 (-110) ✅

\-WAS Capitals 3-Way ML (-115) ❌

\-SJ Sharks v WAS Capitals Over 6.5 (-110) ❌

\--- 

**Player Props (2/4)**

\-PHI Flyers v PIT Penguins: Owen Tippett Over 2.5 Shots on Goal (-105) ✅

\-PHI Flyers v PIT Penguins: Sidney Crosby Over 2.5 Shots on Goal (-105) ✅

\-NY Islanders v EDM Oilers: Connor McDavid Over 2.5 Points (-135) ❌

\-SJ Sharks v WAS Capitals: Alexander Ovechkin Anytime Goal Scorer (+105) ❌

 

**Owen Tippett came through again like an absolute stud** – seriously, this man is a money printer! I gotta remember to up the number of units we wager on him 😌

 

**I did drop a live wager in the Discord today – a big congratulations if you tailed**! I bet on the Boston Celtics to come back and beat the Miami Heat at a nice return of +255, and we cashed (**$100 returned $355**). 💰🔥

‍

Otherwise, regardless of which tier you reside on, today was pretty ‘meh’ — a classic variance day, nothing more.

 

Alright friends, I’m off for the night. Tomorrow, we go again! As always, I’ll see you all bright and early to conquer the books.

Posting completely in english so everyone irrespective of language can understand. 

Given many youth and teens in the southern states are quite influenced by Movies, Wouldn't it be a better idea to give movies tax rebates for 100% regional language use.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1qe94qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qe94qo/thinking_about_you_again_sadly/,Thinking About You Again Sadly,"Hello K,

Woke up from my nap and figured I’d leave a letter here for you in the void now since it is late so that may go undetected…I’ve been doing some soul-searching since my last message to you truthfully. I’m struggling with trying to decide if I really want to go down this road with you again knowing it will probably leave me disappointed and hurt. *I must be delusional for thinking that our next encounter will somehow be different from our previous ones*…

I was so ready to cut you off again but you greeted me with a bright “*good morning*” along with your warm smile that always feels like home to me. Now I’m forced to go another round with you knowing it will just leave me wanting more. *All I really want to know is how will things be different this time around I guess*? I’ve accepted that you are not willing to change so why am I still holding out hope that you will wear your heart on your sleeve for me for once?

But then I remember that smile you gave me; *not from when you greeted me but the one you gave me when you were leaving*. We stared at each other for about a minute without saying anything prior (\*I still get nervous when you stare for too long if you didn’t notice\*). But the smile you had told me everything you were thinking underneath that final “\*goodbye\*”. There was definitely ill-intent behind it; \*I felt as if I were your next victim and you were savoring every moment of my demise\*. It was almost as if desire I carry for you was reflected on your beautiful face causing me to drown in it. \*Yes, I can only blame myself for willing walking into a Venus flytrap this time\*…

When the tension between us reaches these heights, you always push me away and I can’t go through that pain again. I’ve made it known that I care about you deeply and you know that my feelings for you have turned romantic over time so why can’t you be honest with me about how you really see me? \*You’ve seen what it’s done to our relationship in the past\*… it honestly hurts that you’re willing to let \*us\* go down the same path without putting up a fight. It takes at least \*two people\* to fight anyways right?

I’m mad at myself for staying true to my word but you’re the one person I will always run back too and you know that deep down. \*Really I’m just wishing that your flame is still burns for me the same way mine always done when we depart from our meeting place\*…I don’t know what the future holds for us though but I need more from you if this companionship is to continue. If not as lovers then as friends; \*I really just want to be closer to you\*. I know there’s certain circumstances that hold you back but I’ve always been there for you before our initial falling out. I promise I’m trying to stay true to you but I can’t keep pouring into our relationship if you aren’t serious about growing it.

I’m prepared to have that hard talk even if my feelings get hurt because I don’t want to keep living at an arm’s length away from you. \*I want all of you, my love\*. If that’s selfish then fine, you seem to have no qualms about being possessive over me last time I checked….anyways I hope your week went well though. Looking forward to the next chapter in our story, whatever that may look like….\*have a good night\*…

1qe92o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1qe92o9/i_reported_workplace_bullying_and_was_told_im/,I reported workplace bullying and was told I’m “overthinking” — now things are worse and I’m stuck.,"Hi everyone. I’m honestly exhausted and could really use advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

I (26F) have been with my company for about 2 years and I’m one of the more tenured team members. I’ve helped train new hires and was generally on good terms with everyone — until two new coworkers joined.

At first, everything was fine. They asked me questions, came to me for help, etc. Then they started getting close with the rest of the team (including our manager), hanging out after work, grabbing coffee, all that. That’s when things started to feel… off.

The first big red flag was a “team lunch” I wasn’t told about. I only found out because I asked. They said they planned it a while ago and “forgot” to tell me, but wouldn’t give me details about when or where. I got the message and didn’t go. Later they all posted photos together. It stung, but I tried to brush it off.

After that, the exclusion became more obvious:

They sit together and put bags on empty chairs so I can’t sit with them

They gossip and call people names in front of me without including me

They ask each other for help but never approach me anymore, even for things I clearly know

Inside jokes and memes get shared in our work group chat that only they understand

Then it escalated into stuff that feels outright hostile. Things on my desk go missing and “magically” reappear with someone jokingly apologizing. My chair was swapped with a broken one and no one admitted to it — I had to call maintenance myself to fix it.

What bothers me the most is that no one has actually told me what the problem is, or if this is all happening because of something I did that I am unaware of.

Now even our manager is part of their daily gossip and hangouts. I’m getting more and more tasks dumped on me while the rest of the team barely works (lots of gossiping, even sleeping at work), and nothing is being addressed. It feels extremely biased and unprofessional.

I finally reached my limit and reported everything to our Director (who works remotely and wasn’t aware of what was happening). I explained the exclusion, the behavior, and how it’s affecting my work and mental health. I was told this “isn’t something for HR,” that I might be overthinking, and that I should resolve it directly with my manager and coworkers because it could just be a misunderstanding.

A meeting happened between the Director and my Manager — and now the whole team clearly knows I spoke up. Ever since then, the hostility has been worse. I honestly regret saying anything at this point because it feels like I just put a bounty on my back.

I’m drained. I dread going to work. I have been losing sleep over this for the past few weeks. But I can’t afford to lose my job since I have a lot of bills to pay.

I guess I’m asking,

• Is this actually workplace bullying, or am I being gaslit?
• Should I be documenting everything at this point?
• Is it ever worth going to HR when leadership already brushed it off?
• How do you survive a situation like this when quitting isn’t an option?

Any advice, similar experiences, or even just validation would really help. Thanks for reading.",5,1768546715.0,workplace_bullying,3,0.78,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So today it was my science preboard (class 10)
I'm not so good academically and my image in school is also avg...soo I reached school today 5 mins late and I was totally panicking andd I had consumed huge amounts of coffee so that lead to physical jitters and a good amount of anxiety :')
Anddd apparently I had my mobile in my pocket which I didn't knew at the moment (biggest bummer I ever witnessed happening) soo exam started and I started writing and solving the exam soo my invigilator said that check your pockets and stuff like that to everyone soo I did that too
Now the thing is that's when I realised I had it in my pocket soo I went on and kept it between my pants and hoodie (inside the uniform) soo that way no one would notice as my uniform is a bit oversized. Then I was kinda thinking of ways to hide my mobile because I've never ever took it in school although I was still very calm and composed in the moment soo I was casually writing my answers
Andd around 30 mins passed away, the invigilator comes to me and asked me to stand up and I stood up normal without any panic or scaredy look like I stood up with insane confidence 
Soo she started checking my body like the pockets of my hoodie and pants the moment her hand reached the stomach area she noticed my mobile :(
Then asked me what's this and wtf is this thing doimg at my stomach (I WAS INSANELY CALM AND COMPOSED AT THAT MOMENT TOO) 
NOW SHE TOOK MY MOBILE AND CALLED THE SUPERVISOR THEN THE SUPERVISOR CAME AND ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENED SO I TOLD HER HONESTLY THAT THIS AND THIS HAPPENED BUT THE INVIGILATOR YELLED AT ME AND TOLD ME TO KEEP QUIET SO I GOT QUIET OBV
ANDD THEN THEY CALLED MY PARENTS (THEY'RE BERY STRICT AND ABUSIVE TYPE) SOO MY MOM CAME AND THEN MY EXAM GOT CANCELLED 
THEN I WAS CALLED AT THE RECEPTION WHERE I SAW MY MOTHER SITTING AND THEN MY CLASS TEACHER CAME ANDD HE GAVE MY MOM THE RED CARD TO SIGN :') I WAS STILL SOO FUCKING CALM LIKE WHO DA FUCK GETS THIS AMOUNT OF COMPOSURE IN THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS
AND SHE WAS CALLED IN THE PRINCIPAL'S ROOM WHERE GOD KNOW WTF HAPPENED 
THEN I GOT HOME AND IDK WHY I FEEL WEIRD (SOMEWHAT HAPPY, ADVENTUROUS, PANICKING, AND MAYBE ADRENALINE)
PS- I NEVER CHEAT IN EXAMS ALSO I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF SCARY SITUATIONS (LIKE SA STUFF) SO IDK WHY THIS ONE DIDN'T FELT SCARY 
GUYS MY PARENTS WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF HEARING MY OPINION AND THEY'LL BEAT THE SHIT OUTTA ME
WHAT SHOULD I DO??
And if anyone of you had been into a similar situation HELPPPPP😭💔🥀
Also THE INVIGILATOR I HAD WAS THE MOST SCARY TEACHER OF THE SCHOOL AND THEOST BERSERK ONE SOO SHE TOLD THE AUTHORITIES THAT I BOUGHT MY PHONE ONE MORE TIME AND I SPENT 20 MINS IN THE WASHROOM (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN GO TO) LIKE WTF SHE TOTALLY EXAGERRATED THE WHOLE SCENARIO 😭🤚🏻",2,1768546647.0,TeenIndia,17,1.0,False
1qe91kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_starenzox/comments/1qe91kf/what_should_i_do/,What should i do,"i posted this on tumblr, but now I’m posting it here because i genuinely don’t know if i’m overthinking things and overreacting, or reading too much into it. also, i don’t know how to deal with the whole situation. 



just listened to yours by conan gray 30 seconds ago. i’ve always loved that song but it felt relatable for the first time just now.   
  
i did everything i can to get her to like me the way i like her. ik it sounds selfish, but it hurts so much. 

everyone she’s ever dated did nothing but hurt her. i was there through every breakup. every ex story. she even said she’ll take a break form relationships and i supported her. she has too many exes. she falls in love so quickly.   
  
i spoiled her as much as i can in hope she’d do more then *just* flirting. i bought her *and* her friends formula tickets when i first started to like her. bought her flowers after she posted “when my bf says he misses me but he didn’t show up at my door w flowers” on her story. i even bought her blue lilies that *i* made (blue lilies are her favourite flowers), along with red bulls and kinders js bc she likes them, drew the spotify barcode of sparks (this word means something to us) by coldplay on the box, all that just because she was having a rough time. got her a hoodie she reposted 3 months ago on 3rd of december. bought her a coffee on girlfriend’s day bc she was complaining about her bf not bringing her anything. i still got the bag of legos i planned on giving her when i visit our school (she’s a senior, i’m a freshman in college) that i don’t even know if i should give her or not anymore.   
  
don’t get me wrong, i know it’s not about the money, it’s just about the “whys” and “when” i’m getting her those things. i’ve been there through *everything* too. her father going to the hospital. her problems with her mother. her sister’s labour. relationships. insecurities. her bsfs fights. panic attacks. late night texts and constant check ins. even at my *worst*, i never cut her off. i make sure to check on her first at least every other day. her mental health was my top priority.   
  
but then came my birthday. i invited her to the hotel. she disappeared. found her alone in the bathroom. she was calling someone and she quickly hung up. i stayed with her in the bathroom. we hugged about four times. long hugs. we chatted for around half an hour. i admit that i was a bit awkward.. a bit more than i am at texts. and as we talked, she told me she was calling her new boyfriend. “he was saying “i love you” when you walked so i told him i’ll call him later and hang up. embarrassing, right?” *i love you. on my birthday.* of course i was the sweet supportive “i’m always here” friend. I told her i was happy for her. told her to be careful with her emotions. she told me to not worry because she knows he’s the one. but i was so shocked. because a month ago she told she’s taking a break. and it’s not someone she already knew from before. i didn’t even want to ask her how long they’ve been together for them to say their “i love yous.”  
  
i genuinely thought it was just a crush. a crush that lasted for almost two years now.. i don’t know if i’m in love with her or not, but i’ve been thinking about her for the past month. barely spoken to her since my birthday. 

  
i didn’t stop speaking to her just because of that.. after my birthday, my father went to the hospital. i stayed with him for a whole week, went off all social media. and when i texted her again and told her about him, she replied with “i hope he gets better🤍” and never asked again. even though when her father was in the hospital, i kept asking about what he was doing up *until* my birthday. i’m not asking for her to care, it just pains me that i always care more.  
  
her bd’s on april. i’m not even sure if i *want* to bring her a gift or not. i know i *have* to, but i’ve always been thoughtful with everyone’s gifts. but i really don’t have any more energy to think of a gift she’d genuinely like, not like the others. the gifts before.   
  
i think it’s my fault for becoming friends with *because* of the crush. maybe that’s why it hurts more. my crush on her might’ve been obvious, but she was *flirting back*. she even said she’d make out with me when i visit our school. thought she was joking, swore she wasn’t. she sent me “where have you been” by rihanna after receiving one of my gifts. i’d be lying if i said the there wasn’t any sexual jokes. there was. maybe I’m reading too much into all this, but i won’t believe anyone who says this wasn’t a situationship.   
  
it just hurts more to look back at everything now. knowing i did my best to become what she wants. changed myself and tried to be cool enough for her. but i genuinely did care about her. but maybe not enough to hurt myself more then i already had by being there whenever she needed me.   
  
i just gave and gave and gave. but at the end of the day, i’m not her type.

it has always been a lost case. i was just too hopeful to see it. ",1,1768546610.0,u_starenzox,0,1.0,False

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Despite customers having 4 seperate trash bins to throw their wrappers, empty coffee cups, and junk into, they specifically choose one singular trash bin, the one on the right corner of the coffee island! 

And it wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the fact that customers will throw so much crap into that specific bin, that it's overflowing!!

Someone incredibly kind who happens to be a psychologist reached out to me after making that post. We talked over DMs for a bit, and he ended up offering to meet for coffee so he could share some resources with me. Last week we met for coffee and really had a great conversation. 

After meeting up, he reached out to me and said he had a colleague he spoke with after our meet up, who was willing to offer his services on a sliding scale. He passed along his info and said he had already discussed with him and he would be able to open up a sliding scale spot. 

I sent him an email Saturday, within an hour he called me back on a weekend and asked me some questions about my income/financial situation and initial questions, I was honestly afraid I wouldn't be able to even afford a sliding scale fee after several weeks of unpaid mental health leave, but it was very affordable and within my budget and he was even willing to discuss a payment plan if I needed that. He was able to fit me in yesterday! His intake was super  thorough and lasted two hours and I'll be able to see him in person, which is a huge plus. 

I am just so incredibly grateful for all the comments and insight I got, and the extremely kind people who are helping me. I didn't expect to be met with this generosity or kindness.

It was quite typical of how these things go. Physically Day 2 and 3 were hard. Mentally Day 14 was quite hard, so I stopped. Rest were a breeze.

I had black Earl Grey tea, black Instant Coffee and water with lite salt (has Na+ and K+). Didn't work, only did some household work.

1qe8rph,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1qe8rph/im_writing_a_darth_nox_trilogy_thoughts_on/,I'm writing a Darth Nox trilogy - Thoughts on Chapter 1,"Good morning all. As the title states, I'm currently working on a Trilogy with none other than Darth Nox as the main character.

I want to tell a story from a completely different perspective than what we see on the big screen. I focus a lot on how life truly was under the Sith Empire. What was it really like being a slave? Of course there will be a slow burn romance between Nox and a slave he runs into on a faithful evening. 

To achieve all this, I have decided that Nox will not be the outlander and will get a different story filled with mistery, terror and yes... love.  The first book will take place just a few months before the invasion of the Eternal Empire. 

But I have yapped enough, below you can read the first part of Chapter I - The Storm Within. Feel free to give your first opinion of it. 

  
Dark clouds boil over Kaas City. Plastoid windows rattling, street lights flickering. Rumbles in the distance that make the ground shake like a Rancor. Flashes of blue lightning that can split rocks, if not for the conductors to redirect such raw energy. Not many well-meaning people decide to linger in the streets, if any with a storm of this magnitude. Besides all the scheming scumbags you only see the military and droids heavy enough to not fly away. And while the wind swirls around the region, one building resists the chaos. In a rather spiky valley stand a dominant, towering complex. The sharp angles and dark color palette rising high above the resident areas. Lightning might heat things up, but the structure inside is cold and silent. The air in the hallways feels heavy, like your breath sinks into the polished floor. Deep inside the tower, a single room lights up with an unsettling rhythm. Illuminating Patterns on the floor. Stone pillars with unreadable symbols placed in a calculated manner. And exactly in the middle… sits a hooded figure, cloaked in darkness. Three pyramids floating around him and glow according to his breathing. With every inhale, he pulls the flames towards him, and with every exhale they burn brighter. Dust rising from the floor, as if it debates the laws of gravity. It is indeed the only place in Kaas City where all forces exist in harmony.



An assistant slowly walks in, his steps as soft as he can. Afraid that with a single wrong move, this wing will explode. He stares in the room for a few seconds, looking at the supernatural people only talk about in legends. He adjusts his collar and musters up the courage.

“M-m-my Lord?”



Suddenly the red flames stop moving, the pyramids stop spinning. The entire room calms down, like stormy clouds made space for a bright blue sky. The man slowly gets up, his robes falling gently to his ankles, blessing the floor without touching it.

“L-Lord Nox, we finished the examination of the Shyrak as requested. It seems they have a shared ancestry with…”



With a small hand gesture Nox interrupts him, closing his body language and stroking his well-kept beard. So lost in thought it makes the assistant nervous. Not sure if what he brought is good news… or the end of his miserable existence. Those few draining seconds make his head spin, until his boss takes a more relaxing stance.

“Very interesting, and ahead of schedule. Make sure to write every detail in the report, I look forward to reading it.”

“Of course My Lord, even the smallest observation will be explained in great detail.”

“Excellent…“ Nox replies. “But that’s all work for the coming days. It’s already late, and I’m sure you want to be well rested for the task.”

“Y-yes, thank you My Lord.”



He bows respectfully and walks away while Nox gathers his belongings. He may be the most feared Sith in the Empire, but is always respectful. His intentions were unreadable, and every expression and gesture calculated. As he graces the building with his presence, he takes a final look at his workers going home. And with the coming of the night, vanishes like a phantom.



The dimly lit streets are more alive than usual at this hour. Shops with neon signs are staying open longer just before a well-earned weekend. The air feels as tense as always. Shady people making staring at others a hobby. Guards and patrol droids sweeping the streets, but not bothering anyone. In complete armor, Darth Nox walks through. Ancient symbols etched in his chest pieces, his robes flowing behind him like spirits are holding it (maybe they do). His presence is unmistakable, and everywhere people are whispering in awe and fear.

“I-it’s him.”

“I heard he eats spirits.”

“The ghost collector.”

“Don’t look at him, before he consumes your soul.”





Bystanders go out of his way, or bow in submission. Nox hears it all, but he is not here to feast on the living. The real reason may surprise you for such a terrifying person. he peacefully walks into a medium-sized shop that sells decorations and accessories. The other customers hide behind shelfs or freeze in the middle of the isle. Their hearts skipping a few beats, wondering if they are his next target. And yet Nox pays them no mind, wich honestly makes the situation worse if you ask me. He looks at a few orange crystalline decorative pieces, when his attention abruptly goes to his right side. A young woman holding her breath, as her body almost forgot how to. Her skin so pale, without a living host… but she’s very much alive. White-blonde hair that falls just below her shoulders, and light blue, almost icy-looking eyes. She is of human species with a small amount of Rattataki blood in her. As her eyes lock with his, her survival instinct takes over and stammers:

“D-Darth Nox, it’s a-a-an honor to… meet you.”



Her head bowed down and hands in front of her, just like she is trained to do. Nox recognizes her as a slave, likely born into that unfortunate cast of the order. By now the whole store knows they are in a conversation, and it remains deadly quiet for a few seconds. She doesn’t know why she did that, only that staying on people’s good side has kept her alive… so far. Nox reads all of that in a quick glance and is now facing her with the full weight of his terror.

“The honor is mine.” He calmly replies.

“I am looking for decorations to make my office a bit more… colorful. What do you think of these?”

“T-they look… nice.”



As Darth Nox’s gaze falls on her, she drops her eyes in shame. What has she done now, did she give the wrong answer? Was this some sort of test… and failing has dramatic consequences? Lord Nox loosens up and steps away, restoring the air pressure enough for her to breathe again.

“They do, don’t they? Yes, I believe I will buy those.”



He clamps his hands behind him and with a serene flow turns around. With a small nod of approval he wishes her a good evening, then disappears into the shadows of Kaas City. for the next few minutes she is still shaking, still confused why he spared her. Plenty of red-hooded brutes would have ended her, no matter what answer she gave. The others don’t talk to her, believing she is now marked, or standing next to her will bring bad omens. She manages to compose herself, buys a small glowing plant and rushes home.



She barely makes it inside of her apartment with those wobbly knees. Her roommate comes out of the kitchen with her twentieth cup of coffee, a true caffeine junkie. Javira, dark skinned, thirty-one and black curly hair that she usually keeps in a tail. She’s blunt, sarcastic and maybe the only optimistic person in this forsaken place.

“Whoa Serin, you look pale. Did you run into a ghost or something?”

“I-I… Darth N-Nox was standing next to me. A-and he talked… to me.” Serin responds all shaky, as if the room has sub zero temperatures.

“Oww… so I’m not wrong then? THE Darth Nox? The soul-eating terror that—”

“This isn’t helping Javira! I need to sit down and breathe.”

“Yeah, sure. I mean, if he wanted to trap your spirit in another dimension he would have done that. So… good job girl.”



Serin almost passes out on the couch, but Javira is quick to hold her hand and care for her. She is like the older sister who has a lot more life experience. Serin is only twenty-four, soft-spoken and apologizes too much for existing. Like any great sister, Javira grabs a blanket and holds her so tight, it hopes to bring some color back in her skin. Being a slave truly is a sad way of living. How your life, your future can end for no good reason other than entertainment.

“I’m just happy you’re safe, Serin. It’s not exactly paradise, but still better than the previous place we ended up at.”

Serin nods, her whole body shivering. A few tears roll down her sharp snowy cheeks.",3,1768545678.0,swtor,1,0.67,False

1qe8pu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1qe8pu9/feeling_sadhgurus_presence_without_ever_meeting/,"Feeling Sadhguru's Presence Without Ever Meeting Him – A Real, Shared, and Profoundly Detailed Journey 🙏✨","

Like so many of you, I've never had the opportunity to sit in Sadhguru's physical presence during a live satsang at the Isha Yoga Center, catch a glimpse of him leading a program in Coimbatore, or join the electric energy of one of his global initiatives like the Save Soil motorcycle rally. Yet, remarkably, day in and day out, his presence feels vividly real and intimately close – a steady, uplifting life force that softly penetrates the chaos of modern existence, offering unshakable peace, boundless possibility, and a subtle joy that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. This connection began subtly for me through his vast YouTube library during a stretch of relentless daily pressures – think endless notifications, mounting responsibilities, and that familiar undercurrent of mental fatigue we all battle. One click on a video like ""Inner Engineering: Outline for Wellbeing"" or ""Why Are You Here?"" shifts everything: the swirling mental clutter evaporates, replaced by a crystalline clarity that doesn't fade with the screen but carries through meetings, commutes, and quiet evenings, making challenges feel navigable and life feel vibrant.

What elevates this beyond fleeting inspiration is how grounded and applicable his wisdom truly is – it's not lofty theory but practical tools anyone can weave into their routine. Dive into his Save Soil series, for instance: as he recounts his 100-day, 30,000-kilometer journey across 27 countries on a single motorcycle, pleading for just 3-6% soil organic content worldwide, you don't just hear facts – you feel his unyielding passion for our planet's lifeblood surging through you. A routine walk in the park suddenly becomes a reverent dialogue with the earth; you notice the crunch of leaves, the richness of soil underfoot, and it sparks a personal commitment – maybe starting a small compost bin, advocating for better farming in your circle, or simply pausing to touch the ground with gratitude. His Rally for Rivers campaign videos echo this, showing how millions rallied to revive India's sacred waterways, turning abstract ecology into actionable love for rivers that flow through our collective life.

Then there are those light-hearted Q&A sessions and casual talks – gems like ""Death: An Illusion?"" or ""The Secret of Work"" – where his razor-sharp humor slices through the heaviest moods like sunlight through fog. Picture this: you're dragging through a monotonous afternoon, replaying worries, and his playful analogy about life being a ""cosmic joke"" lands perfectly, coaxing an involuntary chuckle that lightens the load. Routine tasks – cooking, emailing, or scrolling mindlessly – start flowing with effortless rhythm, infused with a spontaneous smile and a sense of playfulness that makes time expand. Over weeks of dipping into these, that core vibrancy he speaks of builds organically within: old tensions, lingering regrets from past choices, or low-grade anxieties we've carried for years begin to soften and dissolve, not through force but through simple, effortless grace. Simple joys amplify – the aroma of morning coffee becomes meditative bliss, a conversation with a loved one sparkles with deeper presence, and unexpected tears of sheer gratitude arise, not from pain or overwhelm, but from the profound relief of feeling utterly seen, inclusively embraced, and gently propelled toward your own boundless potential.

This is the magic of his teachings on true inclusion: it transcends physical proximity entirely – no darshan, no handshake, no crowded event hall needed when your inner being begins to resonate with that same pristine clarity and intensity he embodies. It's democratic spirituality at its finest, available to the skeptic in traffic, the parent at bedtime, or anyone pausing their scroll. This presence ignites a quiet revolution in daily life: creativity flows freer (ideas for art, writing, or solutions bubble up unbidden), focus sharpens amid distractions (deadlines met with calm precision), and those rare, ecstatic glimpses – where life feels like a living celebration – become more frequent touchpoints. It's realistic, repeatable, and profoundly human.

Have you experienced Sadhguru's presence this way too, purely through his videos, books, or words? Which specific talk, like a Karma deep-dive, a Cauvery Calling update, or an ""Of Mystics and Mistakes"" excerpt, first bridged that gap for you? What subtle shifts did it bring to your routine? Drop your stories below – let's weave a tapestry of these shared, invisible bonds that connect us worldwide, amplifying the positivity! 🌍❤️🙌🌱

I feel like the SmoothSip Slider is perfect for bringing my coffee to work, especially since the opening is wide enough for an Aeropress!

I wish they would release more fun colours and patterns for the SmoothSip Slider, though. A lot of the times I see how cute the colour drops and UO designs are and I feel like I'm missing out. I love 80s Ski Slopes 💜",7,1768544692.0,Owala,0,1.0,False

I love the homey, peaceful ambiance of The Artist’s House and My Grandparent's House, so I’m looking for similar spots located right by a canal or the river. I’d also love to hear about any unique food finds in these types of settings! Also, if there is already a previous thread about this, please let me know.

I get all the different types of migraines, to migraines with visual aura to hemiplegic migraines, no matter what I always get severe pain and been in the hospital many many times. 

Right now, I have had a regular headache for over 24 hours that won’t go away. This isn’t unusual for me, but wondering if other people get that regular headache bs as well, how often, and how do you treat it? Usually if I get a regular headache it doesn’t last over 24 hours and I can usually sleep it off, but not this time. ",1,1768544665.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

I do not drink sugar water drinks, colas etc
But it’s funny here in NZ (2 weeks into a month tour) 

I order Americanos extra shot 
They serve no sugar at some places 
So you have to ask for the barista to provide 
By the cringe 
They look at me like I’m a functioning sugaholic when I ask for four tubes minimum (in 12oz of coffee seems fair to me)

I know sugar bad 
I’m slim healthy but not exactly fit like some of the adrenaline junkies in Queenstown but why the downer on sugar with my strong coffees!

1qe8foj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1qe8foj/maybe_its_just_not_working_for_me/,Maybe it's just not working for me...,"I'm in my second month, i started at 20mg and bumped up to 30mg of generic. I don't feel much difference from none-20mg-30mg. no switch of focus but the noise has lowered (not gone but toned down) and i feel some side effects like dizziness etc. i was taking it in the morning with a cup of protein milk (18grms of protein per-cup). Which i found out at my dr follow up not to take it with calcium or citrus. Opps so i moved to a calcium free protein, usually nuts and whole grain toast with my meds, coffee one hour after. 

I feel very little motivation to do anything and it's making me notice hunger pangs more. Otherwise I'm not sure what else to do. I was expecting more focus and clear thoughts. Instead I'm not getting much. I didn't think it was a build up in system kind of drug...

Oh and i sleep well. Like a solid 6.5 hrs a night with lots of deep/REM and very little wake ups. I've always slept well. 

I appreciate any insight. Thank you!",1,1768544560.0,VyvanseADHD,1,1.0,False
