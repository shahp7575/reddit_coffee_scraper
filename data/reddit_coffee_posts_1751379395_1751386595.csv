To all the business owners here, I just wanted to ask for some advice or ideas po on how you were able to find a good location for your business.I’ve tried starting a business before I opened a coffee shop, but unfortunately, it happened during the COVID pandemic so I had to close it down. After that, I got into another business with a partner, but I ended up getting scammed.
Now, I’m planning to invest again, this time in a veterinary clinic. My cousin is a vet, so we’re thinking of starting something together.
I just want to ask if any of you know good locations for this kind of business, or if you have any tips when it comes to choosing the right spot. I’d really appreciate any advice you can share.Thanks so much in advance! 😊",1,1751386560.0,BusinessPH,0,1.0,False

The feather hadn’t moved.

It still leaned against the inside of the door like a quiet decision, its black surface catching no light, the burn mark at the tip clean and precise—unnatural. Jasmine stared at it longer than she meant to, until Bran gave a low, soft huff behind her. Not a warning. Not a comfort. Just acknowledgment.

She picked it up.

The red line along the spine hadn’t dried. That was the first wrong thing. Blood didn’t stay wet like that—unless it wasn’t quite blood. Not human. Not now.

She turned it between her fingers. No scent. No residue.

And then her finger opened.

No break. No sting. Just a slow, narrow bead along the pad of her left index finger. A familiar place. The skin there was already thinner. Used. The cut looked like nothing—less than a papercut—but it pulsed with something old.

She didn’t say anything. Didn’t curse or flinch. She just set the feather down on the entry table and reached under the sink for the same cloth she always used. Clean. Folded. Tucked behind a jar of coconut oil and unopened dog chews.

She wrapped it tight, fingers trembling only slightly.

Outside, the morning hadn’t yet settled into shape. Fog crawled across the yard like a spill, milky and deliberate. The mailbox flag was down. She hadn’t expected anything, but the red streak on the feather’s spine tugged her eyes toward the door’s mail slot again.

She opened it slowly.

Nothing on the floor.

But something caught—taped—to the metal lip inside. High and to the right. She had to use the wooden cooking spoon from the umbrella bin to knock it loose. It dropped with a soft slap.

An envelope.

No stamp. No writing. Just thick, weathered cardstock—government-issue heavy. She turned it over. Sealed, but not with glue. Pressed closed like it had never been opened.

She slipped a nail under the flap and peeled it back.

Empty.

Except for the symbol.

Embossed directly into the paper’s interior: a three-part seal. Triangle. Eye. Tree with severed roots.

She didn’t remember it. Not exactly.

But her stomach did.

Her hand curled into a fist. She pressed it against her chest, the cloth between her fingers already darkening.

She didn’t need to ask if this was real.

She’d seen that seal once before.

On a folder. Under fluorescent lights. In a place no child should have ever been sent to forget.

⸻

Chelle knocked like she always did—twice fast, once slow, like a heartbeat that couldn’t decide if it was scared or bored. She let herself in before Jasmine could answer.

Jasmine was still at the sink, rinsing blood off the cloth in cold water, the faucet a whisper she didn’t trust.

“You bled again?” Chelle asked, not looking up from the Pellegrino she’d pulled from her tote. “Jesus, Jazz. You gotta stop keeping your nerves in your fingertips.”

“It wasn’t intentional,” Jasmine said.

“Still looks like it hurt on purpose.”

Jasmine didn’t respond. She wrung the cloth out and watched the last threads of red curl down the drain like something escaping.

“Coffee’s hot,” she said instead.

“You trying to seduce me?” Chelle teased. “It’s working. But I’ll need toast too.”

Jasmine reached for the cabinet. “There was something else.”

“More than phantom feathers?”

She handed Chelle the envelope.

Chelle turned it over with one eyebrow arched. “This looks like bad mail.”

“It was taped inside the slot.”

Chelle opened it and squinted at the seal. Her face changed.

“You’ve seen this before,” Jasmine said quietly.

“Not me. My cousin. The one who went into social work. She used to call this the ‘don’t ask’ stamp. Said she found it once on a sealed file. Group home case that didn’t exist in the state system.”

Jasmine’s spine tingled. “She told you that?”

“Only once. She was drunk. Said it was one of those cases where all the records were ‘closed from above.’ Said the girl’s file had redacted lines like some kind of CIA drop. Said there was no intake form. No foster report. Just a birth date, a photo, and this seal.”

Chelle looked up. “What the hell, Jazz.”

Jasmine didn’t answer right away. She reached for her bandaged finger, pressing it against her palm like a secret she could still control. But the pressure flicked something loose.

The memory wasn’t linear. It never was. Just flashes.

Bunks. Close together. Not quite touching but no space to move. Too many in one room—dozens. Metal frames. No ladders. If you wanted top, you climbed like a thief.

And eyes. God, the eyes.

The overhead lights were always out after dinner. No nightlight. Just silence and the shimmer of wide, watching eyes in every direction. Some crying. Some dead dry. Some never blinking.

No age limit. Toddlers to teens. All in one room like it was cheaper that way.

She remembered the smell—bleach, old mattresses, piss. And a hand that used to tug her ankle in the night. Same pressure every time. Never loud. Never explained.

“You think it was me,” she said.

“I think they kept more than one girl off the books.”

There was a long beat.

“I remember being in a room,” Jasmine murmured. “Concrete floor. No toys. Metal table. Two chairs. A woman in a green dress with no badge. She called me by a different name.”

“Do you remember what name?”

Jasmine closed her eyes.

“No,” she whispered. “But I remember not being allowed to say no to it.”

⸻

The park was quiet for a weekday. Overcast skies kept most of the strollers and yoga moms at home. Which was fine with Jasmine. She preferred when it was just her and the weirdos and the wind.

The trees whispered, but not like they were talking to each other—more like they were listening. Paying attention.

Her daughter was a little ways off, crouched near a log, whispering to a patch of grass like it might whisper back. Probably looking for bugs again. Or a snake. Maybe both.

The grass around her moved strangely—only there. Not wind exactly, more like a shiver beneath the surface. Jasmine watched as a squirrel approached—slow, cautious, curious. It stopped just a few feet away from her daughter, nose twitching.

No surprise there.

Animals and creatures of all kinds found peace with her daughter. Feral farm cats let her pet them like they were house-raised. She could catch snakes barehanded and hold them like bracelets. Jasmine had made it a household rule: Empty all pockets before entering the house. Too many surprises over the years—some living, some… not.

Once, she’d found a bird skull wrapped in tissue inside a jewelry box.

Her daughter had smiled wide and said, “For you.”

There was no creepiness in her voice. No dramatics. Just the calm certainty of someone offering a gift. Jasmine had thanked her. Had meant it. Then buried it in a box in the back of the closet where her daughter wouldn’t think to look.

She leaned back on the bench now, arms crossed tight over her chest. The slats were uneven and dug into her shoulder blades, but she didn’t adjust. She preferred the discomfort. At least it was honest.

Her jaw was locked, and her foot tapped the ground in a steady, anxious rhythm. Her phone was heavy in her pocket. She hadn’t checked it since that morning, and that alone told her everything she needed to know.

He was coming early. She could feel it.

The text would be there, all clipped politeness and sugar-coated control. Something like:

He’ll be here sooner than we thought. Just for the weekend. We’ll all play nice.

That was the tone they always used—we, like it wasn’t just Jasmine being told to sit down, smile, and hand over her kid.

She tapped her fingers against the bench, eyes on her daughter now trying to lure a beetle onto a stick like it was a pet. Completely unaware of the ticking clock.

Completely unaware of what people would do to something they didn’t understand—but desperately wanted to own.

Jasmine wanted—needed—to keep it that way.

She didn’t want her daughter to know about the undercurrents, the whispers, the sharp smiles and watching eyes. Not yet. All she needed to feel was that a lot of people loved her. Really, truly loved her.

And what little girl wouldn’t want that?

But Jasmine knew better. She knew what they did to girls like that.

Pretty girls. Smart girls. Soft girls with power tucked behind their teeth.

She’d lived it.

Bounced from house to house like a problem no one wanted to solve. Labeled “difficult” by people who never asked what she’d survived. She’d been placed with one family after another. Some were quiet cruel. Some were loudly so. But they all said the same thing when the state came calling:

“She doesn’t listen.”

“She’s manipulative.”

“She lies.”

She didn’t lie. Not really.

But truth was slippery when your body was still learning not to flinch at kindness.

The family who’d finally taken her in hadn’t been her first, or second, or even third.

And when they lost her—briefly—after someone found out what they were doing in that basement, she thought it was over. She thought she’d be safe.

She thought wrong.

They got her back.

The paperwork was already changed. New county. New names on the mailbox. Even the dog was different.

And when they picked her up that day from the office, the man had smiled at her and said,

“This time, we’ll make it stick.”

Jasmine knew now what he’d meant. She didn’t then. Not really. Not until it was too late.

A breeze moved through the park, light but sharp, like it had teeth. Jasmine squinted up at the trees, but nothing looked out of place.

Then she heard it.

Not words exactly—but her daughter. Humming. Low, sweet, a tune Jasmine didn’t recognize.

The squirrel had inched even closer now, so close it could’ve crawled into her daughter’s lap if she let it. Two others had joined—flanking her like tiny sentries.

Jasmine stood slowly.

She felt the hairs on her arms rise, and it wasn’t the wind.

A black bird landed on the railing near her bench, staring at her sideways like it knew something she didn’t. It didn’t fly off when she stepped forward. Just cocked its head. Watched.

Her daughter turned and smiled at her.

Like she knew Jasmine had just felt it too.

“They like it when you’re calm,” her daughter said softly, like she was repeating something she’d been told before.

Jasmine didn’t answer. She just sat back down.

The birds didn’t leave.

Her hands were cold now, despite the thick summer air. Her fingers curled in her lap, seeking warmth, pressure, something.

She pressed her thumb into the faint scar across her index finger. Old and flat, from a time she couldn’t talk about—not because she didn’t remember, but because it would sound too rational. Too useful.

The cuts had helped, once.

When the world tipped, they brought her back. Not for attention. Not for pain. For structure. Like tracing the edge of a map only she could see.

That part of her never fully left. It just went underground.

Like everything else.

She rubbed the scar until it pulsed, then stopped.

Let the cold stay.

⸻

Later, after the park, after lunch and cartoons and a few hours of pretending they were normal, Jasmine sat on the back steps while her daughter drew chalk spirals on the patio.

The sun had come out, but the light felt filtered, like it didn’t want to commit.

She found herself staring at her phone. Not to read the text she already knew was there—but to stare at the timestamp.

10:05 a.m.

Same minute the fog had started rolling into the park. Same moment the black bird landed. Same number she’d heard once before, in a dream she wasn’t supposed to remember.

It was the kind of coincidence that didn’t breathe like coincidence.

Her daughter looked up then, as if summoned.

“Do you remember when I was little?” she asked, like it had been decades.

“You still are,” Jasmine said.

“No. Little little. Like three.”

Jasmine felt her throat tighten. “Of course.”

Her daughter turned back to her chalk, drawing now with two hands, eyes narrowed.

“That school with the yellow wall and the naptime dragon,” she said.

Jasmine’s pulse slowed.

“Yeah,” she said. “I remember.”

The Montessori preschool. The one with the black-and-white rugs and the too-happy teachers. The one they left after a single semester.

Her daughter didn’t stop drawing. “That day I made the kids be quiet.”

Jasmine didn’t move.

“You told me to never do that again,” her daughter said, almost softly. “But I didn’t hurt anyone.”

“One of them had asthma,” Jasmine said, her voice sharp before she could catch it. “They couldn’t breathe.”

“But I told them to stop when the lady got scared.”

Jasmine stood too fast. Her body hadn’t meant to—her nerves moved without her.

She remembered that day in full now. Twenty kids, all holding their breath in total silence for thirty-two seconds. The teacher in tears. The director calling Jasmine at work, voice shaking, whispering, “She just looked at them and they stopped breathing.”

Jasmine had laughed. She remembered that too. Not because it was funny, but because laughter was cheaper than fear.

But now?

She didn’t laugh.

Her daughter looked up at her.

“There’s something else,” she said. “I drew someone for you.”

Jasmine’s hands curled into fists. “When?”

“Before lunch. She told me her name this time.”

Jasmine stepped forward slowly.

The drawing sat on the edge of the stairs, folded once. Her daughter didn’t reach for it. Just nodded.

Jasmine opened it.

A woman in a green dress. Sharp chin. No eyes.

Not blank—just gone.

“I saw her once,” Jasmine whispered, her voice breaking before she meant it to. “When I was little.”

“I know,” her daughter said.

Jasmine looked at her. “How do you know?”

“She’s one of the ones who wanted me before you did.”

Jasmine felt the breath leave her chest.

“Wanted you how?”

“To keep me. Like a secret. Like a box. Like a weapon.”

“And now?”

Her daughter smiled faintly. “Now I’m with you.”

A pause.

Jasmine bent slowly, pulled her daughter into her lap, and sat there on the steps, arms around the only thing that ever made her feel like something might still be worth keeping safe.

The birds still hadn’t left.

And neither had the fog.

I am about to turn 16 and want to start driving on my own when I turn 16, so I already learned how to drive and drive everywhere because I love it. Most of the time my mom is the one in the passenger seat because my dad is gone for work. My mom has stated that my siblings prefer driving with my dad due to the fact that my mom doesn't communicate during hard situations. My mom has said and done things while I was driving in which I told her not to do while I was driving. Today made me especially mad, I was driving back to our house(not very far) from the local store. My mom was holding my ice cream amd we were stopped at a red light I then asked if I can have a lick of the ice cream to which she shoves in my face, not horribly bad but to the point where I have ice cream all around my mouth. I laughed and said don't do that while I'm actually driving. I continue to drive and less than 5 minutes after this I'm actually on the road driving and she tries to shove ice cream in my face again. I fliched and jerked the wheel a bit. I got mad and told her to ""never do that while I'm driving"" there was a car next to me which could've ended badly. I was so mad I couldn't form words. She continued to joke in which I told her it wasn't funny. She actually said something funny to which I laughed at but the situation was NOT funny. We got home and I was so mad I decided to take a shower, I cleared my head and wasn't very mad anymore but my mom came into my room after the shower saying goodnight. She starts to close my door stops and say ""you know if you would've done your brothers (18m) college video I would've gotten yall"" (our local coffee shop in which everyone loves).I got mad and told her that I was never told to do it just was told to help him, I did, I told him to get capcut. Capcut tells you how, and it's not hard to figure out(my brother is smart enough to figure it out but to lazy to do it). We had a not so much argument agruement about that which went to the driving incident. She was raising her voice to which she then shuts my down angrily(not really slammed but almost) and says ""Sounds like you're overreacting"". My blood started boiling.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Tigers vs. Washington Nationals: A Tale of Two Teams (and One Very Sad Batting Lineup)**  
*July 1, 2025 | Nationals Park | First Pitch: 6:45 PM ET*

**The Setup:**  
The Detroit Tigers (-161) roll into Washington to face the Washington Nationals (+134) in a game that’s as lopsided as a toddler’s attempt at a soufflé. The Tigers, owners of MLB’s third-best ERA (3.44) and a +99 run differential, are here to flex their muscles against a Nationals team that’s somehow managed a 5.03 ERA and a -68 run differential. It’s the NBA’s *Heat vs. Bobcats* of baseball, but with fewer mascot dances and more existential dread for Washington fans.

**Key Players & Pitchers:**

* **Jack Flaherty (Tigers):** The Tigers’ ace has a 3.20 ERA this season and a 75.8% win rate when Detroit is favored by -161 or more. He’s the human equivalent of a “Do Not Pass Go” card for the Nationals.
* **Trevor Williams (Nationals):** Williams’ 4.85 ERA and 1.45 WHIP make him the anti-Flaherty. He’s the guy who trips over his own shoelaces while trying to pitch.
* **Offense Watch:** The Tigers’ lineup (4th in runs scored, 3rd in batting average) will feast on Williams’ inconsistency. Gleyber Torres and Spencer Torkelson are hitting .295 and .288, respectively, while the Nationals’ James Wood and C.J. Abrams are… well, they’re trying, but their team’s .232 batting average isn’t exactly a recipe for success.

**The Numbers Don’t Lie:**

* **Tigers’ Implied Probability:** \-161 odds = **61.3%** chance to win.
* **Nationals’ Implied Probability:** \+134 odds = **42.5%** chance to win.
* **MLB Underdog Win Rate:** 41%. The Nationals’ +42.5% implied is *slightly* better than average, but not enough to save them.
* **Tigers’ Historical Performance:** 75.8% win rate when favored by -161 or shorter. That’s like a 75% chance to win *plus* a 20% confidence bonus.

**Injuries & Key Updates:**  
No major injuries reported for either team. The Nationals’ lack of a functioning pitching staff is the only “update” you need.

**The Spread & Total:**

* **Tigers -1.5 (-150) / Nationals +1.5 (-130):** The Tigers’ +99 run differential vs. the Nationals’ -68 makes this line a no-brainer. Detroit’s 75.8% win rate as a favorite suggests they’ll cover the spread with the ease of a coffee order at 7 AM.
* **Total: 9.5 Runs (Over -110 / Under -110):** The Nationals’ 5.03 ERA and Tigers’ 3.44 ERA suggest a high-scoring game, but Flaherty’s control (7.3 K/9) and the Nationals’ leaky defense might keep it just under. **Under** is a sneaky value here.

**The Verdict:**  
This is a classic “buy the favorite” scenario. The Tigers’ dominance in both offense and pitching, combined with the Nationals’ inability to field a coherent rotation, makes Detroit the obvious play. The **Detroit Tigers -1.5** offer the best value, with a 75.8% historical cover rate and a 61.3% implied probability. The **Under 9.5** also checks in with positive EV, as Flaherty’s control and the Nationals’ porous defense could limit the fireworks.

**Final Play:**  
**Detroit Tigers -1.5 (-150)**  
**Under 9.5 (-110)**

*Why? Because the Tigers are the league’s best team, the Nationals are the league’s worst, and this isn’t a game—it’s a math problem.* 🎓⚾

I'm especially curious about finding Wi-Fi in areas where mobile data is expensive or unreliable. Has anyone had success with portable Wi-Fi hotspots, and if so, are there particular brands or data plans you'd recommend considering the cost-benefit ratio? Are there any good ways to test the security of a public Wi-Fi network before connecting? It's always a worry about potential risks to personal data.

My biggest advice for your wedding day/ leading up to it is: get what you want! Don’t be afraid to speak up if something should be changed to make it perfect to you. If you can’t do this, make someone close to you in charge of doing it for you. I promise you will not regret it even if you feel super anxious about doing it in the moment. 

Some things I personally asked to have fixed: at my nail appointment one of my extensions was put on slightly crooked and I asked her to redo it, while getting my hair done the morning of the wedding I just didn’t feel like myself despite having approved of that hairstyle at my trial- I asked to do something else after my hair was already done (don’t regret this one bit!! I also gave her a pretty good tip for being so accommodating), and immediately following the ceremony when we were taking some family photos I noticed they moved our standing flower arrangements to a weird location near the bar instead of near our sweetheart table so I grabbed the nearest worker and asked if they could move them (you should’ve seen how attentive they were, almost scared they messed something so small up when it really wasn’t a big deal!). Lastly, my photographer shared a little preview of about 15 photos about 2 weeks post wedding and 3 of them were edited in a way I didn’t like. They didn’t look anything like the engagement photos that they took which we loved or any of their previous work. Besides the hair, this was the hardest for me to do but I emailed them and told them I didn’t like the editing style on those specific photos and referenced that I loved how the rest and the engagement photos were edited. They got back to me & stated they did the editing while on vacation on an iPad vs. in studio on their monitors and noticed the difference in editing. They promised to share with me half of the album when finished to make sure I loved it before doing the other half. Totally worth the stress of sending that email. 

That’s all I have for today! Just remember it’s your day and your vendors want to see you happy. They would rather make a change than you review them in an unfavorable way review of something you didn’t speak up about. 

Btw- I say this as I have on a nail color I don’t like & a nail that doesn’t match the other one on the opposite hand 😂 ",6,1751385889.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

  The grease-slicked hair is a dead giveaway—no pun intended.  
  
  So is the loose and faded leather coat, though not as much that as the sideburns. And the way he keeps nodding and flicking his Zippo open and closed in rhythm with his head. He belongs in a chorus line of dancing Jets and Sharks.  
  
  Then again, I have an eye for these things. I know what to look for, because I’ve seen just about every variety of spook and specter you can imagine.  
  
  The hitchhiker haunts a stretch of winding North Carolina road, bordered by unpainted split-rail fences and a whole lot of nothing. Unsuspecting drivers probably pick him up out of boredom, thinking he’s just some college kid who reads too much Kerouac.  
  
  “My gal, she’s waiting for me,” he says now in an excited voice, like he’s going to see her the minute we crest the next hill. He taps the lighter hard on the dash, twice, and I glance over to make sure he hasn’t left a ding in the panel. This isn’t my car. And I’ve suffered through eight weeks of lawn work for Mr. Dean, the retired army colonel who lives down the block, just so I could borrow it. For a seventy-year-old man he’s got the straightest back I’ve ever seen. If I had more time, I could’ve spent a summer listening to interesting stories about Vietnam. Instead I cleared shrubs and tilled an eight-by-ten plot for new rosebushes while he watched me with a surly eye, making sure his baby would be safe with this seventeen-year-old kid in an old Rolling Stones t-shirt and his mother’s gardening gloves.  
  
  To tell the truth, knowing what I was going to use the car for, I felt a little guilty. It’s a dusk blue 1969 Camaro Rally Sport, mint condition. Drives smooth as silk and growls around curves. I can’t believe he let me take it, yard work or no. But thank god he did, because without it I would have been sunk. It was something the hitchhiker would go for—something worth the trouble of crawling out of the ground.  
  
  “She must be pretty nice,” I say without much interest.  
  
  “Yeah, man, yeah,” he says and, for the hundredth time since I picked him up five miles ago, I wonder how anyone could possibly not know that he’s dead. He sounds like a James Dean movie. And then there’s the smell. Not quite rotten but definitely mossy, hanging around him like a fog. How has anyone mistaken him for the living? How has anyone kept him in the car for the ten miles it takes to get to the Lowren’s Bridge, where he inevitably grabs the wheel and takes both car and driver into the river? Most likely they were creeped out by his clothes and his voice, and by the smell of bones—that smell they seem to know even though they’ve probably never smelled it. But by then it’s always too late. They’d made the decision to pick up a hitchhiker, and they weren’t about to let themselves be scared into going back on it. They rationalized their fears away. People shouldn’t do that.  
  
  In the passenger seat, the hitchhiker is still talking in this faraway voice about his girl back home, somebody named Lisa, and how she’s got the shiniest blond hair and the prettiest red smile, and how they’re going to run off and get married as soon as he gets back hitching from Florida. He was working part of a summer down there for his uncle at a car dealership: the best opportunity to save up for their wedding, even if it did mean they wouldn’t see each other for months.  
  
  “It must’ve been hard, being away from home so long,” I say, and there’s actually a little bit of pity in my voice. “But I’m sure she’ll be glad to see you.”  
  
  “Yeah, man. That’s what I’m talking about. I’ve got everything we need, right in my jacket pocket. We’ll get married and move out to the coast. I’ve got a pal out there, Robby. We can stay with him until I get a job working on cars.”  
  
  “Sure,” I say. The hitchhiker has this sadly optimistic look on his face, lit up by the moon and the glowing dashlights. He never saw Robby, of course. He never saw his girl Lisa, either. Because two miles up the road in the summer of 1970, he got into a car, probably a lot like this one. And he told whoever was driving that he had a way to start an entire life in his coat pocket.  
  
  The locals say that they beat him up pretty good by the bridge and then dragged him back into the trees, where they stabbed him a couple of times and then cut his throat. They pushed his body down an embankment and into one of the tributary streams. That’s where a farmer found it, nearly six months later, wound around with vines, the jaw hanging open in surprise, like he still couldn’t believe that he was stuck there.  
  
  And now he doesn’t know that he’s stuck here. None of them ever seem to know. Right now the hitchhiker is whistling and bobbing along to nonexistent music. He probably still hears whatever they were playing the night they killed him.  
  
  He’s perfectly pleasant. A nice guy to ride with. But when we get to that bridge, he’ll be as angry and ugly as anyone you’ve ever seen. It’s reported that his ghost, dubbed unoriginally as the County 12 Hiker, has killed at least a dozen people and injured another eight. But I can’t really blame him. He never made it home to see his girl, and now he doesn’t want anyone else to get home either.  
  
  We pass mile marker twenty-three—the bridge is less than two minutes away. I’ve driven this road almost every night since we moved here in the hopes that I would catch his thumb in my headlights, but I had no luck. Not until I got behind the wheel of this Rally Sport. Before this it was just half a summer of the same damn road, the same damn blade tucked under my leg. I hate it when it’s like that, like some kind of horribly extended fishing trip. But I don’t give up on them. They always come around in the end.  
  
  I let my foot ease up on the gas.  
  
  “Something wrong, friend?” he asks me.  
  
  I shake my head. “Only that this isn’t my car, and I don’t have the cash to fix it if you decide to try to take me off the bridge.”  
  
  The hitchhiker laughs, just a little too loudly to be normal. “I think you’ve been drinking or something tonight, pal. Maybe you ought to just let me off here.”  
  
  I realize too late that I shouldn’t have said that. I can’t let him out. It’d be my luck that he’d step out and disappear. I’m going to have to kill him while the car is moving or I’ll have to do this all over again, and I doubt that Mr. Dean is willing to let the car go for too many more nights. Besides, I’m moving to Thunder Bay in three days.  
  
  There’s also the thought that I’m doing this to this poor bastard all over again. But that thought is fleeting. He’s already dead.  
  
  I try to keep the speedometer over fifty—too fast for him to really consider jumping out, but with ghosts you can never be sure. I’ll have to work fast.  
  
  It’s when I reach down to take my blade out from under the leg of my jeans that I see the silhouette of the bridge in the moonlight. Right on cue, the hitchhiker grabs the wheel and yanks it to the left. I try to jerk it back right and slam my foot on the brake. I hear the sound of angry rubber on asphalt and out of the corner of my eye I can see that the hitchhiker’s face is gone. No more easy Joe, no slicked hai  
r and eager smile. He’s just a mask of rotten skin and bare, black holes, with teeth like dull stones. It looks like he’s grinning, but it might just be the effect of his lips peeling off.  
  
  Even as the car is fishtailing and trying to stop, I don’t have any flashes of my life before my eyes. What would that even be like? A highlight reel of murdered ghosts. Instead I see a series of quick, ordered images of my dead body: one with the steering wheel through my chest, another with my head gone as the rest of me hangs out the missing window.  
  
  A tree comes up out of nowhere, aimed right for my driver’s side door. I don’t have time to swear, just to jerk the wheel and hit the gas, and the tree is behind me. What I don’t want to do is make it to the bridge. The car is all over the shoulder and the bridge doesn’t have one. It’s narrow, and wooden, and outdated.  
  
  “It’s not so bad, being dead,” the hitchhiker says to me, clawing at my arm, trying to get me off the wheel.  
  
  “What about the smell?” I hiss. Through all of this I haven’t lost my grip on my knife handle. Don’t ask me how; my wrist feels like the bones are going to separate in about ten seconds, and I’ve been pulled off my seat so that I’m hovering over the stick shift. I throw the car into neutral with my hip (should have done that earlier) and pull my blade out fast.  
  
  What happens next is kind of a surprise: the skin comes back onto the hitchhiker’s face, and the green comes back into his eyes. He’s just a kid, staring at my knife. I get the car back under control and hit the brakes.  
  
  The jolt from the stop makes him blink. He looks at me.  
  
  “I worked all summer for this money,” he says softly. “My girl will kill me if I lose it.”  
  
  My heart is pounding from the effort of controlling the lurching car. I don’t want to say anything. I just want to get it over with. But instead I hear my voice.  
  
  “Your girl will forgive you. I promise.” The knife, my father’s athame, is light in my hand.  
  
  “I don’t want to do this again,” the hitchhiker whispers.  
  
  “This is the last time,” I say, and then I strike, drawing the blade across his throat, opening a yawning black line. The hitchhiker’s fingers come up to his neck. They try to press the skin back together, but something as dark and thick as oil floods out of the wound and covers him, bleeding not only down over his vintage-era jacket but also up over his face and eyes, into his hair. The hitchhiker doesn’t scream as he shrivels, but maybe he can’t: his throat was cut and the black fluid has worked its way into his mouth. In less than a minute he’s gone, leaving not a trace behind.  
  
  I pass my hand over the seat. It’s dry. Then I get out of the car and do a walk-around as best I can in the dark, looking for scratches. The tire tread is still smoking and melted. I can hear Mr. Dean’s teeth grinding. I’m leaving town in three days, and now I’ll be spending at least one of them putting on a new set of Goodyears. Come to think of it, maybe I shouldn’t take the car back until the new tires are on.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  It’s after midnight when I park the Rally Sport in our driveway. Mr. Dean’s probably still up, wiry and full of black coffee as he is, watching me cruise carefully down the street. But he doesn’t expect the car back until morning. If I get up early enough, I can take it down to the shop and replace the tires before he knows any different.  
  
  As the headlights cut through the yard and splash onto the face of the house, I see two green dots: the eyes of my mom’s cat. When I get to the front door, it’s gone from the window. It’ll tell her that I’m home. Tybalt is the cat’s name. It’s an unruly thing, and it doesn’t much care for me. I don’t care much for it either. It has a weird habit of pulling all the hair off its tail, leaving little tufts of black all over the house. But my mom likes to have a cat around. Like most children, they can see and hear things that are already dead. A handy trick, when you live with us.  
  
  I go inside, take my shoes off, and climb the stairs by two. I’m dying for a shower—want to get that mossy, rotten feeling off my wrist and shoulder. And I want to check my dad’s athame and rinse off whatever black stuff might be on the edge.  
  
  At the top of the stairs, I stumble against a box and say, “Shit!” a little too loudly. I should know better. My life is lived in a maze of packed boxes. My mom and I are professional packers; we don’t mess around with castoff cardboard from the grocery or liquor stores. We have high-grade, industrial-strength, reinforced boxes with permanent labels. Even in the dark I can see that I just tripped over the Kitchen Utensils (2).  
  
  I tiptoe into the bathroom and pull my knife out of my leather backpack. After I finished off the hitchhiker I wrapped it up in a black velvet cloth, but not neatly. I was in a hurry. I didn’t want to be on the road anymore, or anywhere near the bridge. Seeing the hitchhiker disintegrate didn’t scare me. I’ve seen worse. But it isn’t the kind of thing you get used to.  
  
  “Cas?”  
  
  I look up into the mirror and see the sleepy reflection of my mom, holding the black cat in her arms. I put the athame down on the counter.  
  
  “Hey, Mom. Sorry to wake you.”  
  
  “You know I like to be up when you come in anyway. You should always wake me, so I can sleep.”  
  
  I don’t tell her how dumb that sounds; I just turn on the faucet and start to run the blade under the cold water.  
  
  “I’ll do it,” she says, and touches my arm. Then of course she grabs my wrist, because she can see the bruises that are starting to purple up all along my forearm.  
  
  I expect her to say something motherly; I expect her to quack around like a worried duck for a few minutes and go to the kitchen to get ice and a wet towel, even though the bruises are by no means the worst mark I’ve ever gotten. But this time she doesn’t. Maybe because it’s late, and she’s tired. Or maybe because after three years she’s finally starting to figure out that I’m not going to quit.  
  
  “Give it to me,” she says, and I do, because I’ve gotten the worst of the black stuff off already. She takes it and leaves. I know that she’s off to do what she does every time, which is to boil the blade and then stab it into a big jar of salt, where it will sit under the light of the moon for three days. When she takes it out she’ll wipe it down with cinnamon oil and call it good as new.  
  
  She used to do the same thing for my dad. He’d come home from killing something that was already dead and she’d kiss him on the cheek and take away the athame, as casually as any wife might carry in a briefcase. He and I used to stare at the thing while it sat in its jar of salt, our arms crossed over our chests, conveying to each other that we both thought it was ridiculous. It always seemed to me like an exercise in make-believe. Like it was Excalibur in the rock.  
  
  But my dad let her do it. He knew what he was getting into when he met and married her, a pretty, auburn-haired Wiccan girl with a strand of white flowers braided around her neck. He’d lied back then and called himself Wiccan too, for lack of a better word. But really, Dad wasn’t much of anything.  
  
  He just loved the legends. He loved a good story, tales about the world that made it seem cooler than it really was. He went crazy over Greek mythology, which is where I got my name.  
  
  They compromised on it, because my mom loved Shakespeare, and I ended up called Theseus Cassio. Theseus for the slayer of the Minotaur, and Cassio for Othello’s doomed lieutenant. I think it sounds straight-up stupid. Theseus Cassio Lowood. Everyone just calls me Cas. I suppose I should be glad—my dad also loved Norse mythology, so I might have wound up being called Thor, which would have been basically unbearable.  
  
  I exhale and look in the mirror. There are no marks on my face, or on my gray dress button-up, just like there were no marks on the Rally Sport’s upholstery (thank god). I look ridiculous. I’m in slacks and sleeves like I’m out on a big date, because that’s what I told Mr. Dean I needed the car for. When I left the house tonight my hair was combed back, and there was a little bit of gel in it, but after that fucking kerfuffle it’s hanging across my forehead in dark streaks.  
  
  “Y  
ou should hurry up and get to bed, sweetheart. It’s late and we’ve got more packing to do.”  
  
  My mom is done with the knife. She’s floated back up against the doorjamb and her black cat is twisting around her ankles like a bored fish around a plastic castle.  
  
  “I just want to jump in the shower,” I say. She sighs and turns away.  
  
  “You did get him, didn’t you?” she says over her shoulder, almost like an afterthought.  
  
  “Yeah. I got him.”  
  
  She smiles at me. Her mouth looks sad and wistful. “It was close this time. You thought you’d have him finished before the end of July. Now it’s August.”  
  
  “He was a tougher hunt,” I say, pulling a towel down off the shelf. I don’t think she’s going to say anything else, but she stops and turns back.  
  
  “Would you have stayed here, if you hadn’t gotten him? Would you have pushed her back?”  
  
  I only think for a few seconds, just a natural pause in the conversation, because I knew the answer before she finished asking the question.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  As my mom leaves, I drop the bomb. “Hey, can I borrow some cash for a new set of tires?”  
  
  “Theseus Cassio,” she moans, and I grimace, but her exhausted sigh tells me that I’m good to go in the morning.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Thunder Bay, Ontario, is our destination. I’m going there to kill her. Anna. Anna Korlov. Anna Dressed in Blood.  
  
  “This one has you worried, doesn’t it, Cas,” my mom says from behind the wheel of the U-Haul van. I keep telling her we should just buy our own moving truck, instead of renting. God knows we move often enough, following the ghosts.  
  
  “Why would you say that?” I ask, and she nods at my hand. I hadn’t realized it was tapping against my leather bag, which is where Dad’s athame is. With a focused effort, I don’t take it away. I just keep tapping like it doesn’t matter, like she’s overanalyzing and reading into things.  
  
  “I killed Peter Carver when I was fourteen, Mom,” I say. “I’ve been doing it ever since. Nothing much surprises me anymore.

  There’s a tightening in her face. “You shouldn’t say it like that. You didn’t ‘kill’ Peter Carver. You were attacked by Peter Carver and he was already dead.”  
  
  It amazes me sometimes how she can change a thing just by using the right words. If her occult supply shop ever goes under, she’s got a good future in branding.  
  
  I was attacked by Peter Carver, she says. Yeah. I was attacked. But only after I broke into the Carver family’s abandoned house. It had been my first job. I did it without my mom’s permission, which is actually an understatement. I did it against my mom’s screaming protests and had to pick the lock on my bedroom window to get out of the house. But I did it. I took my father’s knife and broke in. I waited until two a.m. in the room where Peter Carver shot his wife with a .44 caliber pistol and then hung himself with his own belt in the closet. I waited in the same room where his ghost had murdered a real estate agent trying to sell the house two years later, and then a property surveyor a year after that.  
  
  Thinking about it now, I remember my shaking hands and a stomach close to heaving. I remember the desperation to do it, to do what I was supposed to do, like my father had. When the ghosts finally showed up (yes, ghosts plural—turns out that Peter and his wife had reconciled, found a common interest in killing) I think I almost passed out. One came out of the closet with his neck so purple and bent it looked like it was on sideways, and the other bled up through the floor like a paper towel commercial in reverse. She hardly made it out of the boards, I’m proud to say. Instinct took over and I tacked her back down before she could make a move. Carver tackled me though, while I was trying to pull my knife out of the wood that was coated with the stain that used to be his wife. He almost threw me out the window before I scrambled back to the athame, mewling like a kitten. Stabbing him was almost an accident. The knife just sort of ran into him when he wrapped the end of his rope around my throat and spun me around. I never told my mom that part.  
  
  “You know better than that, Mom,” I say. “It’s only other people who think you can’t kill what’s already dead.” I want to say that Dad knew too, but I don’t. She doesn’t like to talk about him, and I know that she hasn’t been the same since he died. She’s not quite here anymore; there’s something missing in all of her smiles, like a blurry spot or a camera lens out of focus. Part of her followed him, wherever it was that he went. I know it’s not that she doesn’t love me. But I don’t think she ever figured on raising a son by herself. Her family was supposed to form a circle. Now we walk around like a photograph that my dad’s been cut out of.  
  
  “I’ll be in and out like that,” I say, snapping my fingers and redirecting the subject. “I might not even spend the whole school year in Thunder Bay.”  
  
  She leans forward over the steering wheel and shakes her head. “You should think about staying longer. I’ve heard it’s a nice place.”  
  
  I roll my eyes. She knows better. Our life isn’t quiet. It isn’t like other lives, where there are roots and routines. We’re a traveling circus. And she can’t even blame it on my dad being killed, because we traveled with him too, though admittedly not as much. It’s the reason that she works the way she does, doing tarot card readings and aura cleansing over the phone, and selling occult supplies online. My mother the mobile witch. She makes a surprisingly good living at it. Even without my dad’s trust accounts, we’d probably be just fine.  
  
  Right now we’re driving north on some winding road that follows the shore of Lake Superior. I was glad to get out of North Carolina, away from iced tea and accents and hospitality that didn’t suit me. Being on the road I feel free, when I’m on my way from here to there, and it won’t be until I put my feet down on Thunder Bay pavement that I’ll feel like I’m back to work. For now I can enjoy the stacks of pines and the layers of sedimentary rock along the roadside, weeping groundwater like a constant regret. Lake Superior is bluer than blue and greener than green, and the clear light coming through the windows makes me squint behind my sunglasses.  
  
  “What are you going to do about college?”  
  
  “Mom,” I moan. Frustration bubbles out of me all of a sudden. She’s doing her half-and-half routine. Half accepting what I am, half insisting that I be a normal kid. I wonder if she did it to my dad too. I don’t think so.  
  
  “Cas,” she moans back. “Superheroes go to college too.”  
  
  “I’m not a superhero,” I say. It’s an awful tag. It’s egotistical, and it doesn’t fit. I don’t parade around in spandex. I don’t do what I do and receive accolades and keys to cities. I work in the dark, killing what should have stayed dead. If people knew what I was up to, they’d probably try to stop me. The idiots would take Casper’s side, and then I’d have to kill Casper and them after Casper bit their throats out. I’m no superhero. If anything I’m Rorschach from Watchmen. I’m Grendel. I’m the survivor in Silent Hill.  
  
  “If you’re so set on doing this during college, there are plenty of cities that could keep you busy for four years.” She turns the U-Haul into a gas station, the last one on the U.S. side. “What about Birmingham? That place is so haunted you could take two a month and still probably have enough to make it through grad school.”  
  
  “Yeah, but then I’d have to go to college in fucking Birmingham,” I say, and she shoots me a look. I mutter an apology. She might be the most liberal-minded of mothers, letting her teenage son roam the night hunting down the remains of murderers, but she still doesn’t like hearing the f-bomb fall out of my mouth.  
  
  She pulls up to the pumps and takes a deep breath. “You’ve avenged him five times over, you know.” Before I can say that I haven’t, she gets out and shuts the door.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  The scenery changed fast once we crossed over into Canada, and I’m looking out the window at miles of rolling hills covered in forest. My mother says it’s something called boreal forest. Recently, since we really started moving around, she’s developed this hobby of intensely researching each new place we live. She says it makes it feel more like a vacation, to know places where she wants to eat and things that she wants to do when we get there. I think it makes her feel like it’s more of a home.  
  
  She’s let Tybalt out of his pet carrier and he’s perched on her shoulder with his tail wrapped around her neck. He doesn’t spare a glance for me. He’s half Siamese and has that breed’s trait of choosing one person to adore and saying screw off to all the rest. Not that I care. I like it when he hisses and bats at me, and the only thing he’s good for is occasionally seeing ghosts before I do.  
  
  My mom is staring up at the clouds, humming something that isn’t a real song. She’s wearing the same smile as her cat.  
  
  “Why the good mood?” I ask. “Isn’t your butt asleep yet?”  
  
  “Been asleep for hours,” she replies. “But I think I’m going to like Thunder Bay. And from the looks of these clouds, I’m going to get to enjoy it for quite some time.”  
  
  I glance up. The clouds are enormous and perfectly white. They sit deadly still in the sky as we drive into them. I watch without blinking until my eyes dry out. They don’t move or change in any way.  
  
  “Driving into unmoving clouds,” she whispers. “Things are going to take longer than you expect.”  
  
  I want to tell her that she’s being superstitious, that clouds not moving don’t mean anything, and besides, if you watch them long enough they have to move—but that would make a hypocrite of me, this guy who lets her cleanse his knife in salt under moonlight.  
  
  The stagnant clouds make me motion-sick for some reason, so I go back to looking at the forest, a blanket of pines in colors of green, brown, and rust, struck through with birch trunks sticking up like bones. I’m usually in a better mood on these trips. The excitement of somewhere new, a new ghost to hunt, new things to see … the prospects usually keep my brain sunny for at least the duration of the drive. Maybe it’s just that I’m tired. I don’t sleep much, and when I do, there’s usually some kind of nightmare involved. But I’m not complaining.  
I’ve had them off and on since I started using the athame. Occupational hazard, I guess, my subconscious letting out all the fear I should be feeling when I walk into places where there are murderous ghosts. Still, I should try to get some rest. The dreams are particularly bad the night after a successful hunt, and they haven’t really calmed down since I took out the hitchhiker.  
  
  An hour or so later, after many attempts at sleep, Thunder Bay comes up in our windshield, a sprawling, urban-esque city of over a hundred thousand living. We drive through the commercial and business districts and I am unimpressed. Walmart is a convenient place for the breathing, but I have never seen a ghost comparing prices on motor oil or trying to jimmy his way into the Xbox 360 game case. It’s only as we get into the heart of the city—the older part of the city that rests above the harbor—that I see what I’m looking for.  
  
  Nestled in between refurbished family homes are houses cut out at bad angles, their coats of paint peeling in scabs and their shutters hanging crooked on their windows so they look like wounded eyes. I barely notice the nicer houses. I blink as we pass and they’re gone, boring and inconsequential.  
  
  Over the course of my life I’ve been to lots of places. Shadowed places where things have gone wrong. Sinister places where things still are. I always hate the sunlit towns, full of newly built developments with double-car garages in shades of pale eggshell, surrounded by green lawns and dotted with laughing children. Those towns aren’t any less haunted than the others. They’re just better liars. I like it more to come to a place like this, where the scent of death is carried to you on every seventh breath.  
  
  I watch the water of Superior lie beside the city like a sleeping dog. My dad always said that water makes the dead feel safe. Nothing draws them more. Or hides them better.  
  
  My mom has turned on the GPS, which she has affectionately named Fran after an uncle with a particularly good sense of direction. Fran’s droning voice is guiding us through the city, directing us like we’re idiots: Prepare to turn left in 100 feet. Prepare to turn left. Turn left. Tybalt, sensing the end of the journey, has returned to his pet carrier, and I reach down and shut the door. He hisses at me like he could have done it himself.  
  
  The house that we rented is smallish, two stories of fresh maroon paint and dark gray trim and shutters. It sits at the base of a hill, the start of a nice flat patch of land. When we pull up there are no neighbors peeking at us from windows or coming out onto their porches to say hello. The house looks contained, and solitary.  
  
  “What do you think?” my mom asks.  
  
  “I like it,” I reply honestly. “You can see things coming.”  
  
  She sighs at me. She’d be happier if I would grin and bound up the stairs of the front porch, throw open the door and race up to the second floor to try and call dibs on the master bedroom. I used to do that sort of thing when we’d move into a new place with Dad. But I was seven. I’m not going to let her road-weary eyes guilt me into anything. Before I know it, we’ll be making daisy chains in the backyard and crowning the cat the king of summer solstice.  
  
  Instead, I grab the pet carrier and get out of the U-Haul. It isn’t ten seconds before I hear my mom’s footsteps behind my own. I wait for her to unlock the front door, and then we go in, smelling cooped-up summer air and the old dirt of strangers. The door has opened on a large living room, already furnished with a cream-colored couch and wingback chair. There’s a brass lamp that needs a new lampshade, and a coffee and end table set in dark mahogany. Farther back, a wooden archway leads to the kitchen and an open dining room.  
  
  I look up into the shadows of the staircase on my right. Quietly, I close the front door behind us and set the pet carrier on the wood floor, then open it up. After a second, a pair of green eyes pokes out, followed by a black, slinky body. This is a trick I learned from my dad. Or rather, that my dad learned from himself.  
  
  He’d been following a tip into Portland. The job in question was the multiple victims of a fire in a canning factory. His mind was wound up with thoughts of machinery and things whose lips cracked open when they spoke. He hadn’t paid much attention when he rented the house we moved into, and of course the landlord didn’t mention that a woman and her unborn baby died there when her husband pushed her down the stairs. These are things one tends to gloss over.

These Traumas have manifested themselves inTO Social Media addiction in particularly phone addiction (youtube,instagram,reddit)whereby i simply switch My Brain off from Thinking and feeling.I struggle to engage with basic stuff which i do enjoy like reading whereby i have to actually my Brain and learn i also have lost a desire to engage in hobbies and interests like Cycling and Cooking nice meals , it's also manifested in quite horrible Depression whereby i am simply Apathetic , not chasing any goals long term or short , i also feel like i have repressed Emotions on this issue whereby even with a therapist i don't really truly open up or even with Friends , on the outset there is not a big indication that i am not doing great as i will obviously engage in the societial expectations of brushing my teeth showering , exercising and going out with Friends .

I Do want to address this and i'm not sure where to start , it's a real no go to discuss this with parents as the one time i did explain an instance where i witnessed quite a serious violent assault it felt they gave quite an uncaring and dismissive response even when explaining the effects it had on me.I feel like explaining these Events to a friend and releasing it all in one go would be beneficial but it would also feel unfair to simply Trauma Dump on somebody like that , funnily enough the only time i felt some semblance of relief is when me and my Friends did MDMA together and i did confess some of these Traumas , (well we all did) obviously MD is not a solution to this.

Weeks sometimes months of elevated mood, a lack of depression, more productivity, lack of focus. Increased appetite, rash decision making, impulsivity, hypersexuality. No second to sit still, very buzzy and all over the place. Very excited about the “next big thing”. An urge to have sex. An urge to do drugs. An urge to pick fights for a high. Constantly feel like im on a rollercoaster going up and up and when I do something exciting enough its like were going down the rollercoaster. Really like changing things on my body like piercings, tattoos, haircuts, nails, etc. I like making plans, expensive plans. I like going shopping and using my Mastercard to pay for everything even if my bank account is at $0. I like speeding and putting myself in dangerous situations. Feels like ive had a monster and two coffees at the same time. I dont recognize the feeling until it has passed. Talk fast. Talk a lot. Talk over people. No patience for how slow everyone else seems to be moving. A want to do better in school/work, but not being able to due to lack of concentration. 

An almost month long episode in which I convinced myself I would become a nail tech, kept buying and ordering nail supplies, piling up a closet. And as soon as the episode was over I was depressed with the debt and stupid decisions I had made. 

An almost 3 week long episode in which I convinced myself my boyfriend was holding me back, ruining my life, and that I wanted to sleep with other people. Became very sexually frustrated and hyper sexual but got no relief from self pleasuring so I reached out to men on the internet and planned to drive 4 hours round trip to meet a man. Broke up with my boyfriend, moved out of his house, then got severely depressed, regretting my actions. Broke things off with the guy I had planned on meeting. Begged my boyfriend to take me back. 

In between switching jobs I became very hyper and because I had just moved out from my bfs place and was back at my parents, the change was hard to manage. I racked up $3000 of debt on a credit card with no way to pay it off, all in 2 weeks. Started my new job and excelled at everything for the first month. Then I quit in the middle of the work day, left at lunch and filed for resignation. Was once again jobless for 2 weeks. Racked up another $1000 in credit card debt. 

I dont know how long this episode lasted but it was a long episode at the end of which I went to work, convinced myself I was better than all my friends and boyfriend, wanted to sleep with guys at work. texted my boyfriend breaking up with him at work. And then showed up at his house at 2 am crying. Severely depressed and tired for the next almost 2 weeks. A lack of motivation, energy and ability to regulate emotions. Urges to self harm were high while processing break up. Bought blades but never relapsed. 

A 4 hour period in which I booked 5 tattoo appointments, made plans to meet my friends on several occasions. And once the mood ended I was severely depressed and embarrassed for the next few days. Told family doctor about this she assumes it was hypomania. 

Intense feelings of stuffiness and boredom. No energy to do anything but be on my phone. Noise bothers me. I go on walks to help with the stuffiness but I have panic attacks when I encounter other walkers. Sometimes I lie down in the backyard hoping the feeling will go away. Fresh air helps but the feeling can last anywhere between hours to days. 

Depression can last anywhere from a week to months. Longest was about 6-7 months. Shortest was a week in which I tried taking my life. On average lasts about 2 weeks, in which I call in sick to work, have trouble getting out of bed, have trouble showering or brushing my teeth, have trouble walking for longer than 5 minutes. Become exhausted and anxious. Become irritable. Become sad and angry if provoked. Become clingy or detached. Look for comfort in harmful things like drugs and self harm. Every major episode so far has led to a suicide attempt. Short, more minor episodes lead to thoughts of suicide but never plans of suicide. Zone out a lot. Thoughts slow down too much to the point that it feels like im moving in slow motion. 

Depression can lead to self deprecating thoughts, thoughts that I will fail in life, thoughts that my family hates me, thoughts that things will not get better. Thoughts that there is no solution to my depression. 

Mania or hypomania feels like a relief. I come out of the depression, feel happier, stronger, livelier. Have better moods, more time to do things. For a long time my gp and I both thought these weeks and months of good moods were just the end of a depressive episode. I was recovering. Until a psychologist did an assessment and diagnosed me with bipolar 1 and bpd. And told me these weeks sometimes months of elevated mood was mania and hypomania. Another doctor I spoke to said my performance in school (going from weeks of bad studying habits to okay ones) and my fluctuation in mood sounded like adhd. ",1,1751385581.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

I started a new position 3 months ago to get out of my prior workplace setting, where I was constantly being put under intense stress which worsened pre-existing conditions, and unfortunately there’s one main member of staff, who is toxic and belittling. 

I joined alongside 2 other new people, and we’ve all received inexcusable treatment from this one colleague, and slight things from another. Neither of these people are in a senior role let alone a management role, and yet they both constantly micromanage, belittle and do whatever (or what little) they want when the actual managers aren’t around. 

One remark to a new colleague was being called out in a email for one minor mistake, and I witnessed said person belittling another member of staff in-person for leaving their laptop at another worksite when they had to change their place of last minute. After these incidents, the atmosphere has been extremely uncomfortable and tense. 

Since then, the afflicting party has been witnessed leaving an hour early without authorisation, neglecting their workload by walking off-site to get a coffee whilst everyone else is working and having to pick up their workload, micromanaging by wondering around and checking what everybody else is doing, and constant small remarks about others.

Multiple longer-standing members of staff have also said about how they’ve gotten used to this behaviour, and additionally reported how the afflicting person has discussed a private employee termination matter, who would not of known about this had they not accessed the administrative emails. 

Multiple staff have escalated these behaviours to our line manager, and the manager above with no recourse, and complaints are falling on deaf ears. In addition to this, the afflicting party used to be in a position a step-above our current line manager, so it feels like they have a superiority complex in regards to this and that our line manager won’t action anything.

Today I was very close to walking out and terminating my contract with immediate effect due to the intense atmosphere and stress, and I know I’m not the only member of staff feeling like this. I am actively seeking a new position, however the market is very minimal where I am located so it’s making it harder. I have considered emailing HR directly (due to them being situated in another part of the country), however as a newer member of staff, and still in probationary period, i worry about negative recourse. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1751385490.0,AskHRUK,0,1.0,False

1) Starbucks : Mostly good , but I wasn't comfortable with the idea of spending atleast 500 rupees for getting some space to work. Also I had to eat lunch, so option ruled out. 
2) Coffee Cup, other cafes: Better than starbucks, but wasn't sure if I could spend 7-8 hrs uninterrupted, along with a power outlet without getting awkward looks. 
3) awfis, WeWork : Day pass worth ₹350-650, option of cafe : This seemed to be the best choice, but somehow I felt hesitant.
4) Lemerian Working Cafe : Faraway ( Banjara Hills isn't close), but reviews seemed positive, so went for it. 

Experience : I was greeted by  pleasant staff, although it seemed like they were students. I was offered 2 packages for the day : 349 for 6 hours ( One hot beverage like coffee/Tea free)
499 for 8hours ( Any 1  beverage except hot chocolate/redbull free). 
I chose the 499 package and got myself a kitkat shake worth 320rs free 😎.

Hey everyone!

I'm currently using smartcrop.py (github.com/smartcrop/smartcrop.py) for image cropping in Python, but it's pretty basic. It only detects edges and color gradients, not actual objects.

For example, if I have a photo with a coffee cup, I want it to recognize the cup as the main subject and crop around it. But smartcrop just finds areas with most edges/contrast, which often misses the actual focal point.

**Looking for:**

* Python library that uses AI/ML for object-aware cropping
* Can identify main subjects (people, objects, etc.)
* More modern than just edge detection

Any recommendations for libraries that actually understand what's in the image?

Toby (my 6 y/o at the time) was eating his toast at the table behind me as I tried to hold my eyes open, washing dishes at the sink. It was all my mess that I'd left over from the night before. I was a chocolate-maker and we lived in a very small town, so my services were in very high-demand but, being an only parent, so was my time.

My eyelids were heavy when Toby appeared beside me, sliding his plate into the soapy water with a cheeky grin. ""Don't forget your number sheet."", I told him.

He nodded, taking it from the side placing it next to his school bag. He then stopped in his tracks, pausing as if in deep thought, and said, ""Can I play with the boy in the field?""

""Which boy?"", I asked him.

""The boy I can see from my window.""

At the time, I was unfazed by this, maybe I was too tired but we often made little jokes, ""bits"" you might call them. Since his dad left, he'd had to mature so fast, helping me out frequently, way more than he should be at his age. So, when he made jokes, they were often bizarre in nature.

""Where are this boy's parents?"", I asked.

""He doesn't have them."", he said in a chipper tone. This convinced me he was trying to have fun.

""No parents?"", I exclaimed, ""Who looks after him then, the sheep?""

He proceeded to smile and make the noise of a sheep and I did the same, leaning into the playful nature, when I turned to the clock and noticed the time. I pulled the gloves off my hands and went for my, now cold, coffee. I had to get Toby's attention again as he'd begun ""bahing"" like a sheep a little too loud.

""Go on then Shaun, go and brush your teeth"", I told him and he ran up the stairs on all-fours, continuing to make the sound of a sheep.

I remember turning back to the sink and staring out the window for a moment, mulling over what he'd told me, wondering if there'd been any truth in it. Often when things like these happen, the seeds of concern are planted early on, hiding in plain-sight and even as I thought that exact thought, I failed to see it. Toby called from upstairs, asking about where his uniform was so I poured the rest of the coffee down the sink and went to help him.

That was the first time and as I'm reading this back, I ache at the thought that I'll never talk to that little boy again. He was so sweet and helpful. I was lucky to have a son who was so understanding, so mature and though my husband had his flaws, one thing I'm glad was passed down was his empathy. He had such kindness in his eyes, even taking care of me in my darker days, which I've always felt guilty for but now I long to see even a glimpse of that.

I apologise if you came here for a scary story but instead find a mother dousing her grief over this account.

The next seed of concern was a few days later. That was one of my last big events, it was a large venue and I think I did around six-hundred chocolates, varying in type but the hall didn't have enough access parking so when I set up and packed away, I had to run back and forth between the rear entrance and the front car park. All this being said, I was late to pick Toby up from school and when I finally arrived, he was sitting on the wall outside the school with his tutor.

The tutor gave one of those looks, the one that judges without saying a word, a forced smile that creased her cheeks but never reached her eyes. I picked Toby up and apologised to his tutor. It's not like it happened often-- ever, it didn't happen ever. That was the first time and she was judging.

I opened the door for Toby and went to buckle him in, when he insisted he could do it himself.

""Okay then,"" I said, ""make sure though. I don't want you rattling around back here like the last pea in a pod.""

I sat back in the driver's seat and caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror, desheveled and messy, a few of the greys were starting to show through again but I tried to tuck them underneath. I spotted Toby pulling something from his bag. He always loved drawing and I actively encouraged it. I'd tip the entire tin of crayons and pencils out onto the table, shavings and chunks would go everywhere and he was always considerate and concerned about the mess but I told him that it wasn't his job to worry about that.

I turned to the backseat, ""Hey Picasso, let's see.""

He looked at me for a moment, unmoving. I tilted my head, 'don't be bashful'. He then placed the drawing face-down on the seat next to him.

""It's not for you.""

This was very peculiar as he'd never been this shy or protective over his work. I'll admit, maybe being late had something to do with it, that somewhere in his mind, not showing me an expression of his emotion was a punishment.

""Who is it for then?"", I asked.

""The little boy who lives down the drain.""

This was the first time hearing the detail about the drain and the first time I took serious note of this imaginary friend. However, Toby didn't have as many friends as most kids his age. Sometimes I thought it was because of his maturity relative to others but the councilor has since informed me that it was actually our relationship that was the problem, that I coddled him. That's one thing no parent wants to hear. I didn't know this at the time but our closeness is also the reason I didn't see these signs, that I didn't see what was right in front of me.

That night, we watched Labyrnth (his choice) and ate some of the chocolate left over from my event. I made sure to monitor how much he had this time. I'd trusted him before but he was only a child after all and chocolate is hard to resist. I couldn't have him throwing up at school the next day and telling the tutor how much he'd eaten the night before... I could see that judging smirk already.

I tucked him into bed and we went through our routine. We had a little rhyme:

He'd ask, ""What if I can't sleep?""

""Then don't weap..."" I'd reply.

Then together: ""...close your eyes and count the sheep.""

That was the first night I noticed he was getting a little too old for it. He didn't smile like he used to, he was on his side, his eyes only briefly met with mine. I kissed him on the forehead, turned the bedroom light off and switched on his nightlight.

I aim to be a good mother but sometimes things happen that are out of our control and the next seed for concern is the one I think about the most. It's the one I had the most power over, the one I know for a fact I could've changed and taken action... it just so happens, it was the one that led directly to the events that traumatized my little boy.

It was a Friday, Toby was at school and I was using the time to get some of the washing done. I had a stack of clothes clamped between my arms as I walked into his room, my phone was on speaker on top of the pile as I talked to one of my potential clients. I'd met her at a coffee morning, one I'd only just made the time for and we hit it off. I didn't like these events as a whole but I convinced myself that if I wasn't going for me, the least I could do was go for the networking. Most of our conversation was friendly but I could tell where it was heading when she didn't look at all surprised as I told her about my chocolate business.

She was throwing a christening party and needed some chocolates in batch, this call would confirm I was the chocolate-maker for the event. I wasn't overly excited about the idea because my oven was nowhere near large enough to cater for that number of people but I desperately needed the money.

I was putting the washing in Toby's drawers, disagreeing on prices and sizes of orders, when I saw a drawing I hadn't seen before. I assumed this was the one Toby had drawn at school and didn't want me to see. It was a picture of me. The person had long hair, a chefs hat and was throwing chocolates out into a crowd of smiling faces. I thought about it for a moment, then turned it over. I'd almost forgotten it was my birthday this weekend but he hadn't. On the back was a sweet note: ""To them, you're the Chocolate Lady, to me you're the best mum."" - Love from your chocolate monster.

My heart melted but I couldn't help but feel guilty that I'd seen it before he gave it to me, what if I couldn't act surprised enough? That didn't turn out to be an issue, as I still have it stuck to the fridge with a magnet and it still makes my heart ache, though for a very different reason now.

That drawing wasn't the only one I found in his room that week but after I placed it back in the drawer, finally having agreed with the client on a price, I spotted something out the window. Now, I didn't often look out of his window, in fact, he kept his room so tidy, I rarely spent long in there at all but I'd never seen this before.

Across the road, over the verge, past the fence and the marsh, atop the man-made hill formed from the ground that once rested where our house did, was a blue spec. And it was just a spec at first. I was still trying to get on with the pleasantries with the client, most of which had become mundane and second-nature but I must've let my disinterest grow apparent when I heard, ""Is everything alright?"" over the speaker.

""Yes... I'll look at the calendar to see when we can meet up-- discuss it in-person."", I then hung up.

I moved closer to the window, unable to see much without my glasses. It was a blue spec. It didn't move, I couldn't tell if it was an object or a person so I went downstairs, grabbed my glasses and headed outside. It was a child, standing atop the hill in a blue raincoat. I called out to it, stepping closer, making it to the fence, asking where their parents were but I didn't receive a reply.

I ducked beneath the fence to get a little closer, but as I rose, I saw the hill was now empty, no blue coat kid.

This, for anyone else, would've been a red flag and I know I should've done something; told someone, investigated but kids played over the fields all the time, seemingly neglecting the brand new play park built for them and opting to run, roll and hide amonst the long grass and rolling hills, with parents warning them never to go past the treeline or play in the fields when it rained. The sewage runoff often spilled over when it rained for more than a day, making the ground not only boggy, but rancid in aroma.

I didn't investigate though, and until the police questioned me, I didn't tell anyone about the blue coat kid.

Picking Toby up from school (on-time), I brought him back home, he helped me make dinner, then whilst it was in the oven, we played with LEGO in the living room. He was never the most creative with it though, he always asked me to keep the instructions so he could rebuild things another time, often resulting in multi-coloured animals and houses. That night, he made a (mostly) blue wolf and for about half an hour, he was howling like one. I had to pretend to be one and let him win a fight for him to finally stop so we could eat dinner.

I tucked him into bed, allowing him to have the wolf figure on his nightstand and we did our nightly routine:

""What if I can't sleep?"", he asked.

""Then don't weap...""

He then said ""Bare your teeth and eat the sheep.""

I knew he was playing around but I had a lot of chocolate to make, I looked at him, unamused and shook my head. ""No, what are we supposed to do?""

He rolled over and said, ""I don't want to count sheep anymore.""

It's a hearbreaking moment for any parent. Something you've been doing every night for seven and a half years, suddenly comes to an end, I just didn't think it would happen this soon. I took a moment to myself, fighting the lump at the back of my throat, then nodded solemly. ""Okay.""

I turned the bedroom light off and left the room. I didn't turn the nightlight on and it never went on again.

I spent the rest of the night surrounded by milk, cocoa and sugar. Safe to say, when you do this job, there is such a thing as too much chocolate. The sweet smell gets stuck in your nose, it becomes sickly after a while but I was more concerned with not letting the white chocolate burn (it's easy to do). I digress, it was around 11:30, three hours since I put Toby to bed, when I felt a draft funnel through the house. To begin with, it was nice: the feeling of cool air sweeping through whilst I stood over boiling water and surrounded myself with sweet heat but the smell took a rancid turn.

It got so bad, I had to walk out into the hall, where I noticed that the front door was open. For anyone, this is a terrifying sight, since I remember very distinctly having locked it but there it was, blowing back and forth in the wind.

I ran back into the kitchen and grabbed the first knife I could, which just so happened to be covered in chocolate, I made my way upstairs, onto the landing and switched the light on, hearing a soft thudding. I turned to see that Toby's door was slightly ajar, blowing back and forth with the draft. I held my knife so it pointed down towards the floor, more like the killers do in movies than the victims. I peered into the room but my eyes wouldn't adjust to the darkness, so I opened it wider, then wider, revealing an empty bed in front of me.

I dropped the knife to my side but never let go of it and threw back Toby's duvet...

...there was no one there.

I panicked but soon reeled my mind back in and my eyes turned to the window. I tore back the curtain and looked out upon the fields to see the blue coat kid once again, this time, he had a companion.

I leaned out the window, screaming Toby's name at the top of my lungs but he didn't seem to hear me, or if he did, he decided to ignore it because whatever the blue coat kid promised was much more inticing. The moment I caught my breath again, I was running downstairs with the knife and heading for the door. I didn't care about the door being left open, I didn't care about the rain soaking my shirt and when I reached the fence, I didn't care about the boggy, rancid mud soaking into my socks.

I made it down the slope and plunged into the mud, any shoe's I would've worn would've been lost after the first few steps. I let go of the knife at some point too, using my hands to propel and force myself forwards. I couldn't tell you what was going through my head, other than panic but I must admit, not a lot of my thought was on who the blue coat kid was, I was only concerned with getting my son back.

Reaching the peak of the hill, I looked out upon the rest of the marsh below me, spotting the treeline in the distance and a small, grey structure, covered somewhat by leaves and bushes, I was convinced that this is where it had take him and my instincts were correct.

The rest of the journey towards the pipe is a blur and, in my memory at least, I seemed to teleport to its position because the next thing I knew, I was screaming Toby's name down a dark, putrid, concrete pipe that extended into the verge that seperated the marsh from the forest. I almost cried when I heard his voice coming from the darkness, I still don't know if it was out of relief or fear.

""I found him Mummy!"", he said (though I wasn't paying attention to his exact words).

""That's okay, just please get out, come towards me, let's go home!""

""I found the little boy!"", he called back.

At this point, my fear had become rage, mostly at myself but that came out in my voice, I could physically feel it rising from my chest like a heat-- I couldn't stop it from blurting out, ""Get the fuck out of there now Toby!""

It was silent after that but I'd used all of the breath I had left, I couldn't explain or apologise to Toby in the darkness, I feared that my anger had driven him further inside... that is until I heard the scraping of shoes. It sounded how a toddler would drag their feet in a boring museum that didn't feature any dinosaurs: it echoed and trooped on, scraping, scraping... it was annoying and went on for long enough for me to realise just how far Toby must've climbed into the drain but eventually, I saw him.

Well, I feared it wasn't him at first because I saw something moving towards me but it wasn't the figure I'd expected. Out from the drain came Toby, wearing a bright-blue raincoat, covered in black splotches.

I embraced him, as bad as we both smelled, and tore the coat away from him as soon as I could. I wrapped my arms around him and we made our way back across the marsh.

The next five hours were a blur and until I'd had a pot of coffee, I didn't feel fully conscious at any point. The next thing I remember was sitting at my own kitchen table with a police officer sitting opposite me. I was explaining the situation without hesitation, without thinking but my eyes never left the swirling bubbles that sat atop the black coffee I clasped between my hands.

I finally looked up when he said my name, his mouth twitching, almost shocked I actually looked up. He folded his notepad and told me he'd keep me informed, let me know about any developments--

""I don't wan to know."", I said, cutting him off as soon as the energy could move it's attention from my swirling stomach, to my vocal chords.

He handed me the card of a child psychologist and left my kitchen, meeting in hushed tones with the other officers waiting just outside my door. It turned out, one of my neighbours had heard my screaming from the window and called the police, initially to make a noise complaint but as the people in white overalls and blue gloves rolled a stretcher into the back of a van, I suddenly grew an appreciation for my nosey neighbours.

Did you know they make different sized body bags?

The one atop the stretcher was too small and instead of being hurridly shoved into the back of a white and red van, followed by a cacophany of sirens, it was calmly slid into the back of a black van and it drove away without so much as disturbing the crows upon their perches.

I don't know the name of the boy they found down the drain and I don't care to find out. All I have control over is how I move forward with Toby. He still visits the councilor, though he's in a special home now that treats children with his specific condition. He still visits but they're supervised and he doesn't joke as much as he used to.

This is best for both of us, as instead of the extra money I make going towards Toby's things, I put it towards seeing someone for myself. This, to a lot of people, may sound selfish and it did to me at first too but what you have to understand is that I am no use to my son, if I am not right. When a plane is going down, you're instructed to put your own mask on first, then help the person next to you... that is what I'm doing.

Toby's ten now.

He used to be ""ahead of the curve"" in terms of maturity levels but that isolation is what drove him to his imaginary friend and now he is being treated for anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder and bulimia which are all understandable after spending at least an hour in a sweage tunnel next to a corpse. I fought the council on the exact length of time he was in there (that was the big deal in the case) because I could swear I saw him atop the hill not a half hour before I found him but they forced Toby to give a statement. Though a child's word cannot be taken as gospel, the neglect he must've felt to write that he was ""alone with the skelington for an hr"" was enough to convince the jury.

There's one thing that I've never understood about the whole night. Mothers know when their child is lying (as any parent and they'll tell you the same) but Toby wasn't lying when I asked him if he took the wolf with him and he replied with:

""No, he promised to give it back but he doesn't like to share.""

That sentence plants more seed for concern than anything else I have experienced.",1,1751385304.0,u_Pale_Bar_3310,0,1.0,False

EU’s Anti-Deforestation Law at Risk from New “Negligible Risk” Category,"https://preview.redd.it/howscgx8baaf1.jpg?width=1054&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b8c57da7f2c7d8cde66f73d7563bd13ee967203

With just six months before the EU’s long-awaited Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) kicks in, critics are sounding the alarm over proposed last-minute changes that could seriously weaken the law’s impact.

The European Commission has floated a controversial “**negligible risk**” category for certain countries — which would **exempt** cocoa, coffee, soy and other high-risk commodities **from key due diligence requirements**, including GPS tracking and full traceability.

🌍 That means products from countries designated as “low risk” could enter EU markets **without proper checks** for deforestation.

👎 NGOs like Earthsight, WWF, and Forest Trends are calling this move **a backdoor for greenwashing** and “regulatory laundering.”

🗣️ One Brussels-based expert told CocoaRadar: *“This is a gift to bad actors… It incentivizes companies to reroute through low-regulation countries.”*

Some of the other proposed changes include:

* Allowing **annual** (not shipment-based) due diligence filings
* A separate “**no-risk**” category requiring **zero due diligence**
* Pressure from countries like Austria and Italy to **delay enforcement** past the current December 30, 2025 deadline

Meanwhile, the world lost **6.7 million hectares** of tropical rainforest in 2024 alone. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

🧩 **Reddit, what do you think?**

Can the EUDR still be a meaningful tool to fight global deforestation — or is it being gutted before it even starts?

**TL;DR:** New “negligible risk” loophole could let deforestation-linked cocoa and other commodities into Europe without proper oversight. Experts and NGOs say the law’s integrity is at stake.

1lp598a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lp598a/bag_of_bones_by_stephen_king/,Bag of Bones by Stephen King:,"**CHAPTER ONE**  
On a very hot day in August of 1994, my wife told me she was going down to the Derry Rite Aid to pick up a refill on her sinus medicine prescription ¡ª this is stuff you can buy over the counter these days, I believe. I'd finished my writing for the day and offered to pick it up for her. She said thanks, but she wanted to get a piece of fish at the supermarket next door anyway; two birds with one stone and all of that. She blew a kiss at me off the palm of her hand and went out. The next time I saw her, she was on TV. That's how you identify the dead here in Derry ¡ª no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the walls and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out of a chilly drawer on casters; you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope.  
  
  The Rite Aid and the Shopwell are less than a mile from our house, in a little neighborhood strip mall which also supports a video store, a used-book store named Spread It Around (they do a very brisk business in my old paperbacks), a Radio Shack, and a Fast Foto. It's on Up-Mile Hill, at the intersection of Witcham and Jackson.  
  
  She parked in front of Blockbuster Video, went into the drugstore, and did business with Mr. Joe Wyzer, who was the druggist in those days; he has since moved on to the Rite Aid in Bangor. At the checkout she picked up one of those little chocolates with marshmallow inside, this one in the shape of a mouse. I found it later, in her purse. I unwrapped it and ate it myself, sitting at the kitchen table with the contents of her red handbag spread out in front of me, and it was like taking Communion. When it was gone except for the taste of chocolate on my tongue and in my throat, I burst into tears. I sat there in the litter of her Kleenex and makeup and keys and half-finished rolls of Certs and cried with my hands over my eyes, the way a kid cries.  
  
  The sinus inhaler was in a Rite Aid bag. It had cost twelve dollars and eighteen cents. There was something else in the bag, too ¡ª an item which had cost twenty-two-fifty. I looked at this other item for a long time, seeing it but not understanding it. I was surprised, maybe even stunned, but the idea that Johanna Arlen Noonan might have been leading another life, one I knew nothing about, never crossed my mind. Not then.  
  
  Jo left the register, walked out into the bright, hammering sun again, swapping her regular glasses for her prescription sunglasses as she did, and just as she stepped from beneath the drugstore's slight overhang (I am imagining a little here, I suppose, crossing over into the country of the novelist a little, but not by much; only by inches, and you can trust me on that), there was that shrewish howl of locked tires on pavement that means there's going to be either an accident or a very close call.  
  
  This time it happened ¡ª the sort of accident which happened at that stupid X-shaped intersection at least once a week, it seemed. A 1989 Toyota was pulling out of the shopping-center parking lot and turning left onto Jackson Street. Behind the wheel was Mrs. Esther Easterling of Barrett's Orchards. She was accompanied by her friend Mrs Irene Deorsey, also of Barrett's Orchards, who had shopped the video store without finding anything she wanted to rent. Too much violence, Irene said. Both women were cigarette widows. Esther could hardly have missed the orange Public Works dump truck coming down the hill; although she denied this to the police, to the newspaper, and to me when I talked to her some two months later, I think it likely that she just forgot to look. As my own mother (another cigarette widow) used to say, 'The two most common ailments of the elderly are arthritis and forgetfulness. They can't be held responsible for neither. '  
  
  Driving the Public Works truck was William Fraker, of Old Cape. Mr. Fraker was thirty-eight years old on the day of my wife's death, driving with his shirt off and thinking how badly he wanted a cool shower and a cold beer, not necessarily in that order. He and three other men had spent eight hours putting down asphalt patch out on the Harris Avenue Extension near the airport, a hot job on a hot day, and Bill Fraker said yeah, he might have been going a little too fast ¡ª maybe forty in a thirty-mile-an-hour zone. He was eager to get back to the garage, sign off on the truck, and get behind the wheel of his own F-150, which had air conditioning. Also, the dump truck's brakes, while good enough to pass inspection, were a long way from tip-top condition. Fraker hit them as soon as he saw the Toyota pull out in front of him (he hit his horn, as well), but it was too late. He heard screaming tires ¡ª his own, and Esther's as she belatedly realized her danger ¡ª and saw her face for just a moment.  
  
  'That was the worst part, somehow,' he told me as we sat on his porch, drinking beers ¡ª it was October by then, and although the sun was warm on our faces, we were both wearing sweaters. 'You know how high up you sit in one of those dump trucks? ' I nodded. 'Well, she was looking up to see me ¡ª craning up, you'd say ¡ª and the sun was full in her face. I could see how old she was. I remember thinking, 'Holy shit, she's gonna break like glass if I can't stop. ' But old people are tough, more often than not. They can surprise you. I mean, look at how it turned out, both those old biddies still alive, and your wife . . . '  
  
  He stopped then, bright red color dashing into his cheeks, making him look like a boy who has been laughed at in the schoolyard by girls who have noticed his fly is unzipped. It was comical, but if I'd smiled, it only would have confused him.  
  
  'Mr. Noonan, I'm sorry. My mouth just sort of ran away with me. '  
  
  'It's all right,' I told him. 'I'm over the worst of it, anyway. ' That was a lie, but it put us back on track.  
  
  'Anyway,' he said, 'we hit. There was a loud bang, and a crumping sound when the driver's side of the car caved in. Breaking glass, too. I was thrown against the wheel hard enough so I couldn't draw a breath without it hurting for a week or more, and I had a big bruise right here. ' He drew an arc on his chest just below the collarbones. 'I banged my head on the windshield hard enough to crack the glass, but all I got up there was a little purple knob . . . no bleeding, not even a headache. My wife says I've just got a naturally thick skull. I saw the woman driving the Toyota, Mrs. Easterling, thrown across the console between the front bucket seats. Then we were finally stopped, all tangled together in the middle of the street, and I got out to see how bad they were. I tell you, I expected to find them both dead. '  
  
  Neither of them was dead, neither of them was even unconscious, although Mrs. Easterling had three broken ribs and a dislocated hip. Mrs. Deorsey, who had been a seat away from the impact, suffered a concussion when she rapped her head on her window. That was all; she was 'treated and released at Home Hospital,' as the Derry News always puts it in such cases.  
  
  My wife, the former Johanna Arlen of Malden, Massachusetts, saw it all from where she stood outside the drugstore, with her purse slung over her shoulder and her prescription bag in one hand. Like Bill Fraker, she must have thought the occupants of the Toyota were either dead or seriously hurt. The sound of the collision had been a hollow, authoritative bang which rolled through the hot afternoon air like a bowling ball down an alley. The sound of breaking glass edged it like jagged lace. The two vehicles were tangled violently together in the middle of Jackson Street, the dirty orange truck looming over the pale-blue import like a bullying parent over a cowering child.  
  
  Johanna began to sprint across the parking lot toward the street. Others were doing the same all around her. One of them, Miss Jill Dunbarry, had been window-shopping at Radio Shack when the accident occurred. She said she thought she remembered running past Johanna ¡ª at least she was pretty sure she remembered someone in yellow slacks ¡ª but she couldn't be sure. By then, Mrs. Easterling was screaming that she was hurt, they were both hurt, wouldn't somebody help her and her friend Irene.  
  
  Halfway across the parking lot, near a little cluster of newspaper dispensers, my wife fell down. Her purse-strap stayed over her shoulder, but her prescription bag slipped from her hand, and the sinus inhaler slid halfway out. The other item stayed put.  
  
  No one noticed her lying there by the newspaper dispensers; everyone was focused on the tangled vehicles, the scr  
eaming women, the spreading puddle of water and antifreeze from the Public Works truck's ruptured radiator. ('That's gas!' the clerk from Fast Foto shouted to anyone who would listen. 'That's gas, watch out she don't blow, fellas!') I suppose one or two of the would-be rescuers might have jumped right over her, perhaps thinking she had fainted. To assume such a thing on a day when the temperature was pushing ninety-five degrees would not have been unreasonable.  
  
  Roughly two dozen people from the shopping center clustered around the accident; another four dozen or so came running over from Strawford Park, where a baseball game had been going on. I imagine that all the things you would expect to hear in such situations were said, many of them more than once. Milling around. Someone reaching through the misshapen hole which had been the driver's-side window to pat Esther's trembling old hand. People immediately giving way for Joe Wyzer; at such moments anyone in a white coat automatically becomes the belle of the ball. In the distance, the warble of an ambulance siren rising like shaky air over an incinerator.  
  
  All during this, lying unnoticed in the parking lot, was my wife with her purse still over her shoulder (inside, still wrapped in foil, her uneaten chocolate-marshmallow mouse) and her white prescription bag near one outstretched hand. It was Joe Wyzer, hurrying back to the pharmacy to get a compression bandage for Irene Deorsey's head, who spotted her. He recognized her even though she was lying face-down. He recognized her by her red hair, white blouse, and yellow slacks. He recognized her because he had waited on her not fifteen minutes before.  
  
  'Mrs. Noonan?' he asked, forgetting all about the compression bandage for the dazed but apparently not too badly hurt Irene Deorsey. 'Mrs. Noonan, are you all right?' Knowing already (or so I suspect; perhaps I am wrong) that she was not.  
  
  He turned her over. It took both hands to do it, and even then he had to work hard, kneeling and pushing and lifting there in the parking lot with the heat baking down from above and then bouncing back up from the asphalt. Dead people put on weight, it seems to me; both in their flesh and in our minds, they put on weight.  
  
  There were red marks on her face. When I identified her I could see them clearly even on the video monitor. I started to ask the assistant medical examiner what they were, but then I knew. Late August, hot pavement, elementary, my dear Watson. My wife died getting a sunburn.  
  
  Wyzer got up, saw that the ambulance had arrived, and ran toward it. He pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed one of the attendants as he got out from behind the wheel. 'There's a woman over there,' Wyzer said, pointing toward the parking lot.  
  
  'Guy, we've got two women right here, and a man as well,' the attendant said. He tried to pull away, but Wyzer held on.  
  
  'Never mind them right now,' he said. 'They're basically okay. The woman over there isn't. '  
  
  The woman over there was dead, and I'm pretty sure Joe Wyzer knew it . . . but he had his priorities straight. Give him that. And he was convincing enough to get both paramedics moving away from the tangle of truck and Toyota, in spite of Esther Easterling's cries of pain and the rumbles of protest from the Greek chorus.  
  
  When they got to my wife, one of the paramedics was quick to confirm what Joe Wyzer had already suspected. 'Holy shit,' the other one said. 'What happened to her?'  
  
  'Heart, most likely,' the first one said. 'She got excited and it just blew out on her. '  
  
  But it wasn't her heart. The autopsy revealed a brain aneurysm which she might have been living with, all unknown, for as long as five years. As she sprinted across the parking lot toward the accident, that weak vessel in her cerebral cortex had blown like a tire, drowning her control-centers in blood and killing her. Death had probably not been instantaneous, the assistant medical examiner told me, but it had still come swiftly enough . . . and she wouldn't have suffered. Just one big black nova, all sensation and thought gone even before she hit the pavement.  
  
  'Can I help you in any way, Mr. Noonan?' the assistant ME asked, turning me gently away from the still face and closed eyes on the video monitor. 'Do you have questions? I'll answer them if I can. '  
  
  'Just one,' I said.  
  
  I told him what she'd purchased in the drugstore just before she died. Then I asked my question.  
  
  The days leading up to the funeral and the funeral itself are dreamlike in my memory ¡ª the clearest memory I have is of eating Jo's chocolate mouse and crying . . . crying mostly, I think, because I knew how soon the taste of it would be gone. I had one other crying fit a few days after we buried her, and I will tell you about that one shortly.  
  
  I was glad for the arrival of Jo's family, and particularly for the arrival of her oldest brother, Frank. It was Frank Arlen ¡ª fifty, red-cheeked, portly, and with a head of lush dark hair ¡ª who organized the arrangements . . . who wound up actually dickering with the funeral director.  
  
  'I can't believe you did that,' I said later, as we sat in a booth at Jack's Pub, drinking beers.  
  
  'He was trying to stick it to you, Mikey,' he said. 'I hate guys like that. ' He reached into his back pocket, brought out a handkerchief, and wiped absently at his cheeks with it. He hadn't broken down ¡ª none of the Arlens broke down, at least not when I was with them ¡ª but Frank had leaked steadily all day; he looked like a man suffering from severe conjunctivitis.  
  
  There had been six Arlen sibs in all, Jo the youngest and the only girl. She had been the pet of her big brothers. I suspect that if I'd had anything to do with her death, the five of them would have torn me apart with their bare hands. As it was, they formed a protective shield around me instead, and that was good. I suppose I might have muddled through without them, but I don't know how.  
  
  I was thirty-six, remember. You don't expect to have to bury your wife when you're thirty-six and she herself is two years younger. Death was the last thing on our minds.  
  
  'If a guy gets caught taking your stereo out of your car, they call it theft and put him in jail,' Frank said. The Arlens had come from Massachusetts, and I could still hear Malden in Frank's voice ¡ª caught was coowat, car was cah, call was caul. 'If the same guy is trying to sell a grieving husband a three-thousand-dollar casket for forty-five hundred dollars, they call it business and ask him to speak at the Rotary Club luncheon. Greedy asshole, I fed him his lunch, didn't I?'  
  
  'Yes. You did. '  
  
  'You okay, Mikey?'  
  
  'I'm okay. '  
  
  'Sincerely okay?'  
  
  'How the fuck should I know?' I asked him, loud enough to turn some heads in a nearby booth. And then: 'She was pregnant. '  
  
  His face grew very still. 'What?'  
  
  I struggled to keep my voice down. 'Pregnant. Six or seven weeks, according to the . . . you know, the autopsy. Did you know? Did she tell you?'  
  
  'No! Christ, no!' But there was a funny look on his face, as if she had told him something. 'I knew you were trying, of course . . . she said you had a low sperm count and it might take a little while, but the doctor thought you guys'd probably . . . sooner or later you'd probably . . . ' He trailed off, looking down at his hands. 'They can tell that, huh? They check for that?'  
  
  'They can tell. As for checking, I don't know if they do it automatically or not. I asked. '  
  
  'Why?'  
  
  'She didn't just buy sinus medicine before she died. She also bought one of those home pregnancy-testing kits. '  
  
  'You had no idea? No clue?'  
  
  I shook my head. He reached across the table and squeezed my shoulder. 'She wanted to be sure, that's all. You know that, don't you?'  
  
  A refill on my sinus medicine and a piece of fish, she'd said. Looking like always. A woman off to run a couple of errands. We had been trying to have a kid for eight years, but she had looked just like always.  
  
  'Sure,' I said, patting Frank's hand. 'Sure, big guy. I know. '  
  
  It was the Arlens ¡ª led by Frank who handled Johanna's send off. As the writer of the family, I was assigned the obituary. My brother came up from Virginia with my mom and my aunt and was allowed to tend t  
he guest-book at the viewings. My mother ¡ª almost completely ga-ga at the age of sixty-six, although the doctors refused to call it Alzheimer's ¡ª lived in Memphis with her sister, two years younger and only slightly less wonky. They were in charge of cutting the cake and the pies at the funeral reception.  
  
  Everything else was arranged by the Arlens, from the viewing hours to the components of the funeral ceremony. Frank and Victor, the second-youngest brother, spoke brief tributes. Jo's dad offered a prayer for his daughter's soul. And at the end, Pete Breedlove, the boy who cut our grass in the summer and raked our yard in the fall, brought everyone to tears by singing 'Blessed Assurance,' which Frank said had been Jo's favorite hymn as a girl. How Frank found Pete and persuaded him to sing at the funeral is something I never found out.  
  
  We got through it ¡ª the afternoon and evening viewings on Tuesday, the funeral service on Wednesday morning, then the little pray-over at Fairlawn Cemetery. What I remember most was thinking how hot it was, how lost I felt without having Jo to talk to, and that I wished I had bought a new pair of shoes. Jo would have pestered me to death about the ones I was wearing, if she had been there.  
  
  Later on I talked to my brother, Sid, told him we had to do something about our mother and Aunt Francine before the two of them disappeared completely into the Twilight Zone. They were too young for a nursing home; what did Sid advise?  
  
  He advised something, but I'll be damned if I know what it was. I agreed to it, I remember that, but not what it was. Later that day, Siddy, our mom, and our aunt climbed back into Siddy's rental car for the drive to Boston, where they would spend the night and then grab the Southern Crescent the following day. My brother is happy enough to chaperone the old folks, but he doesn't fly, even if the tickets are on me. He claims there are no breakdown lanes in the sky if the engine quits.  
  
  Most of the Arlens left the next day. Once more it was dog-hot, the sun glaring out of a white-haze sky and lying on everything like melted brass. They stood in front of our house ¡ª which had become solely my house' by then ¡ª with three taxis lined up at the curb behind them, big galoots hugging one another amid the litter of tote-bags and saying their goodbyes in those foggy Massachusetts accents.  
  
  Frank stayed another day. We picked a big bunch of flowers behind the house ¡ª not those ghastly-smelling hothouse things whose aroma I always associate with death and organ-music but real flowers, the kind Jo liked best ¡ª and stuck them in a couple of coffee cans I found in the back pantry. We went out to Fairlawn and put them on the new grave. Then we just sat there for awhile under the beating sun.  
  
  'She was always just the sweetest thing in my life,' Frank said at last in a strange, muffled voice. 'We took care of Jo when we were kids. Us guys. No one messed with Jo, I'll tell you. Anyone tried, we'd feed em their lunch. '  
  
  'She told me a lot of stories. '  
  
  'Good ones?'  
  
  'Yeah, real good. '  
  
  'I'm going to miss her so much. '  
  
  'Me, too,' I said. 'Frank . . . listen . . . I know you were her favorite brother. She never called you, maybe just to say that she missed a period or was feeling whoopsy in the morning? You can tell me. I won't be pissed. '  
  
  'But she didn't. Honest to God. Was she whoopsy in the morning?'  
  
  'Not that I saw. ' And that was just it. I hadn't seen anything. Of course I'd been writing, and when I write I pretty much trance out. But she knew where I went in those trances. She could have found me and shaken me fully awake. Why hadn't she? Why would she hide good news? Not wanting to tell me until she was sure was plausible . . . but it somehow wasn't Jo.  
  
  'Was it a boy or a girl?' he asked.  
  
  'A girl. '  
  
  We'd had names picked out and waiting for most of our marriage. A boy would have been Andrew. Our daughter would have been Kia. Kia Jane Noonan.  
  
  Frank, divorced six years and on his own, had been staying with me. On our way back to the house he said, 'I worry about you, Mikey. You haven't got much family to fall back on at a time like this, and what you do have is far away. '  
  
  'I'll be all right,' I said. He nodded.  
  
  'That's what we say, anyway, isn't it?'  
  
  'We?'  
  
  'Guys. I'll be all right. '  
  
  And if we're not, we try to make sure no one knows it. ' He looked at me, eyes still leaking, handkerchief in one big sunburned hand. 'If you're not all right, Mikey, and you don't want to call your brother ¡ª I saw the way you looked at him ¡ª let me be your brother. For Jo's sake if not your own. '  
  
  'Okay,' I said, respecting and appreciating the offer, also knowing I would do no such thing. I don't call people for help. It's not because of the way I was raised, at least I don't think so; it's the way I was made. Johanna once said that if I was drowning at Dark Score Lake, where we have a summer home, I would die silently fifty feet out from the public beach rather than yell for help. It's not a question of love or affection. I can give those and I can take them. I feel pain like anyone else. I need to touch and be touched. But if someone asks me, 'Are you all right?' I can't answer no. I can't say help me.  
  
  A couple of hours later Frank left for the southern end of the state. When he opened the car door, I was touched to see that the taped book he was listening to was one of mine. He hugged me, then surprised me with a kiss on the mouth, a good hard smack. 'If you need to talk, call,' he said. 'And if you need to be with someone, just come. '  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  'And be careful. '  
  
  That startled me. The combination of heat and grief had made me feel as if I had been living in a dream for the last few days, but that got through.  
  
  'Careful of what?'  
  
  'I don't know,' he said. 'I don't know, Mikey. ' Then he got into his car ¡ª he was so big and it was so little that he looked as if he were wearing it ¡ª and drove away. The sun was going down by then. Do you know how the sun looks at the end of a hot day in August, all orange and somehow squashed, as if an invisible hand were pushing down on the top of it and at any moment it might just pop like an overfilled mosquito and splatter all over the horizon? It was like that. In the east, where it was already dark, thunder was rumbling. But there was no rain that night, only a dark that came down as thick and stifling as a blanket. All the same, I slipped in front of the word processor and wrote for an hour or so. It went pretty well, as I remember. And you know, even when it doesn't, it passes the time.  
  
  My second crying fit came three or four days after the funeral. That sense of being in a dream persisted ¡ª I walked, I talked, I answered the phone, I worked on my book, which had been about eighty percent complete when Jo died ¡ª but all the time there was this clear sense of disconnection, a feeling that everything was going on at a distance from the real me, that I was more or less phoning it in.  
  
  Denise Breedlove, Pete's mother, called and asked if I wouldn't like her to bring a couple of her friends over one day the following week and give the big old Edwardian pile I now lived in alone ¡ª rolling around in it like the last pea in a restaurant-sized can ¡ª a good stem-to-stern cleaning. They would do it, she said, for a hundred dollars split even among the three of them, and mostly because it wasn't good for me to go on without it. There had to be a scrubbing after a death, she said, even if the death didn't happen in the house itself.  
  
  I told her it was a fine idea, but I would pay her and the women she brought a hundred dollars each for six hours' work. At the end of the six hours, I wanted the job done. And if it wasn't, I told her, it would be done, anyway.  
  
  'Mr. Noonan, that's far too much,' she said.  
  
  'Maybe and maybe not, but it's what I'm paying,' I said. 'Will you do it?'  
  
  She said she would, of course she would.  
  
  Perhaps predictably, I found myself going through the house on the evening before they came, doing a pre-cleaning inspection. I guess I didn't want the women (two of whom would be complete strangers to me) finding anything that would embarrass them or me: a pair of Johanna's silk pan  
ties stuffed down behind the sofa cushions, perhaps ('We are often overcome on the sofa, Michael,' she said to me once, 'have you noticed?'), or beer cans under the loveseat on the sunporch, maybe even an unflushed toilet. In truth, I can't tell you any one thing I was looking for; that sense of operating in a dream still held firm control over my mind. The clearest thoughts I had during those days were either about the end of the novel I was writing (the psychotic killer had lured my heroine to a high-rise building and meant to push her off the roof) or about the Norco Home Pregnancy Test Jo had bought on the day she died. Sinus prescription, she had said. Piece of fish for supper, she had said. And her eyes had shown me nothing else I needed to look at twice.  
  
  Near the end of my 'pre-cleaning,' I looked under our bed and saw an open paperback on Jo's side. She hadn't been dead long, but few household lands are so dusty as the Kingdom of Underbed, and the light-gray coating I saw on the book when I brought it out made me think of Johanna's face and hands in her coffin ¡ª Jo in the Kingdom of Underground. Did it get dusty inside a coffin? Surely not, but ¡ª  
  
  I pushed the thought away. It pretended to go, but all day long it kept creeping back, like Tolstoy's white bear.  
  
  Johanna and I had both been English majors at the University of Maine, and like many others, I reckon, we fell in love to the sound of Shakespeare and the Tilbury Town cynicism of Edwin Arlington Robinson. Yet the writer who had bound us closest together was no college-friendly poet or essayist but W. Somerset Maugham, that elderly globetrotting novelist-playwright with the reptile's face (always obscured by cigarette smoke in his photographs, it seems) and the romantic's heart. So it did not surprise me much to find that the book under the bed was The Moon and Sixpence. I had read it myself as a late teenager, not once but twice, identifying passionately with the character of Charles Strickland. (It was writing I wanted to do in the South Seas, of course, not painting. )  
  
  She had been using a playing card from some defunct deck as her place-marker, and as I opened the book, I thought of something she had said when I was first getting to know her. In Twentieth-Century British Lit, this had been, probably in 1980. Johanna Arlen had been a fiery little sophomore. I was a senior, picking up the Twentieth-Century Brits simply because I had time on my hands that last semester. 'A hundred years from now,' she had said, 'the shame of the mid-twentieth-century literary critics will be that they embraced Lawrence and ignored Maugham. ' This was greeted with contemptuously good-natured laughter (they all knew Women in Love was one of the greatest damn books ever written), but I didn't laugh. I fell in love.  
  
  The playing card marked pages 102 and 103 ¡ª Dirk Stroeve has just discovered that his wife has left him for Strickland, Maugham's version of Paul Gauguin. The narrator tries to buck Stroeve up. My dear fellow, don't be unhappy. She'll come back . . .  
  
  'Easy for you to say,' I murmured to the room which now belonged just to me.  
  
  I turned the page and read this: Strickland's injurious calm robbed Stroeve of his self-control Blind rage seized him, and without knowing what he was doing he flung himself on Strickland. Strickland was taken by surprise and he staggered, but he was very strong, even after his illness, and in a moment, he did not exactly know how, Stroeve found himself on the floor.  
  
  'You funny little man,' said Strickland.  
  
  It occurred to me that Jo was never going to turn the page and hear Strickland call the pathetic Stroeve a funny little man. In a moment of brilliant epiphany I have never forgotten ¡ª how could I? it was one of the worst moments of my life ¡ª I understood it wasn't a mistake that would be rectified, or a dream from which I would awaken. Johanna was dead.  
  
  My strength was robbed by grief. If the bed hadn't been there, I would have fallen to the floor. We weep from our eyes, it's all we can do, but on that evening I felt as if every pore of my body were weeping, every crack and cranny. I sat there on her side of the bed, with her dusty paperback copy of The Moon and Sixpence in my hand, and I wailed. I think it was surprise as much as pain; in spite of the corpse I had seen and identified on a high-resolution video monitor, in spite of the funeral and Pete Breedlove singing 'Blessed Assurance' in his high, sweet tenor voice, in spite of the graveside service with its ashes to ashes and dust to dust, I hadn't really believed it. The Penguin paperback did for me what the big gray coffin had not: it insisted she was dead.  
  
  You funny little man, said Strickland.  
  
  I lay back on our bed, crossed my forearms over my face, and cried myself to sleep that way as children do when they're unhappy. I had an awful dream. In it I woke up, saw the paperback of The Moon and Sixpence still lying on the coverlet beside me, and decided to put it back under the bed where I had found it. You know how confused dreams are ¡ª logic like Dal¨ª clocks gone so soft they lie over the branches of trees like throw-rugs.  
  
  I put the playing-card bookmark back between pages 102 and 103 ¡ª a turn of the index finger away from You funny little man, said Strickland now and forever ¡ª and rolled onto my side, hanging my head over the edge of the bed, meaning to put the book back exactly where I had found it.  
  
  Jo was lying there amid the dust-kitties. A strand of cobweb hung down from the bottom of the box spring and caressed her cheek like a feather.  
  
  Her red hair looked dull, but her eyes were dark and alert and baleful in her white face. And when she spoke, I knew that death had driven her insane.  
  
  'Give me that,' she hissed. 'It's my dust-catcher. ' She snatched it out of my hand before I could offer it to her. For a moment our fingers touched, and hers were as cold as twigs after a frost. She opened the book to her place, the playing card fluttering out, and placed Somerset Maugham over her face ¡ª a shroud of words. As she crossed her hands on her bosom and lay still, I realized she was wearing the blue dress I had buried her in. She had come out of her grave to hide under our bed.  
  
  I awoke with a muffled cry and a painful jerk that almost tumbled me off the side of the bed. I hadn't been asleep long ¡ª the tears were still damp on my cheeks, and my eyelids had that funny stretched feel they get after a bout of weeping. The dream had been so vivid that I had to roll on my side, hang my head down, and peer under the bed, sure she would be there with the book over her face, that she would reach out with her cold fingers to touch me.  
  
  There was nothing there, of course ¡ª dreams are just dreams. Nevertheless, I spent the rest of the night on the couch in my study. It was the right choice, I guess, because there were no more dreams that night. Only the nothingness of good sleep.  
**CHAPTER TWO**

 I never suffered from writer's block during the ten years of my marriage, and did not suffer it immediately after Johanna's death. I was in fact so unfamiliar with the condition that it had pretty well set in before I knew anything out of the ordinary was going on. I think this was because in my heart I believed that such conditions only affected 'literary'' types of the sort who are discussed, deconstructed, and sometimes dismissed in the New York Review of Books.  
  
  My writing career and my marriage covered almost exactly the same span. I finished the first draft of my first novel, Being Two, not long after Jo and I became officially engaged (I popped an opal ring on the third finger of her left hand, a hundred and ten bucks at Day's Jewellers, and quite a bit more than I could afford at the time . . . but Johanna seemed utterly thrilled with it), and I finished my last novel, All the Way from the Top, about a month after she was declared dead. This was the one about the psychotic killer with the love of high places. It was published in the fall of 1995. I have published other novels since then ¡ª a paradox I can explain ¡ª but I don't think there'll be a Michael Noonan novel on any list in the foreseeable future. I know what writer's block is now, all right. I know more about it than I ever wanted to.  
  
  When I hesitantly showed Jo the first draft of Being Two, she read it in one evening, curled up in her favorite chair, wearing nothing but panties and a tee-shirt with the Maine black bear on the front, drinking glass after glass of iced tea. I went out to the garage (we were renting a house in Bangor with another couple on as shaky financial ground as we were. . and no, Jo and I weren't quite married at that point, although as far as I know, that opal ring never left her finger) and puttered aimlessly, feeling like a guy in a New Yorker cartoon one of those about funny fellows in the delivery waiting room. As I remember, I fucked up a so-simple-a-child-can-do-it birdhouse kit and almost cut off the index finger of my left hand. Every twenty minutes or so I'd go back inside and peek at Jo. If she noticed, she gave no sign. I took that as hopeful.  
  
  I was sitting on the back stoop, looking up at the stars and smoking, when she came out, sat down beside me, and put her hand on the back of my neck.  
  
  'Well?' I said.  
  
  'It's good,' she said. 'Now why don't you come inside and do me?' And before I could answer, the panties she had been wearing dropped in my lap in a little whisper of nylon.  
  
  Afterward, lying in bed and eating oranges (a vice we later outgrew), I asked her: 'Good as in publishable?'  
  
  'Well,' she said, 'I don't know anything about the glamorous world of publishing, but I've been reading for pleasure all my life ¡ª Curious George was my first love, if you want to know ¡ª '  
  
  'I don't. ' She leaned over and popped an orange segment into my mouth, her breast warm and provocative against my arm. ' ¡ª and I read this with great pleasure. My prediction is that your career as a reporter for the Derry News is never going to survive its rookie stage. I think I'm going to be a novelist's wife. '  
  
  Her words thrilled me ¡ª actually brought goosebumps out on my arms. No, she didn't know anything about the glamorous world of publishing, but if she believed, I believed . . . and belief turned out to be the right course. I got an agent through my old creative-writing teacher (who read my novel and damned it with faint praise, seeing its commercial qualities as a kind of heresy, I think), and the agent sold Being Two to Random House, the first publisher to see it.  
  
  Jo was right about my career as a reporter, as well. I spent four months covering flower shows, drag races, and bean suppers at about a hundred a week before my first check from Random House came in ¡ª $27,000, after the agent's commission had been deducted. I wasn't in the newsroom long enough to get even that first minor bump in salary, but they had a going-away party for me just the same. At Jack's Pub, this was, now that I think of it. There was a banner hung over the tables in the back room which said GOOD LUCK MIKE ¡ª WRITE ON! Later, when we got home, Johanna said that if envy was acid, there would have been nothing left of me but my belt-buckle and three teeth.

Hi everyone,
My name is Joseph, and I’m the founder of Greenova Tea in Frisco, TX. I’m launching a concept that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world, and to be honest—I’m scared. This is something I’ve poured my heart into, and I’m reaching out in hopes of getting your support.

We’re opening our doors this Saturday, July 5th, from 9am to 5pm for a soft launch. Greenova isn’t your typical tea shop. We use a unique method called the Dual Phase Pull to extract tea with espresso-level strength, creating what we call Teapresso. With that, we craft drinks that look and feel like coffee—but are 100% tea.

The twist? Our signature Teatte contains more caffeine than your average café latte, but with a smoother, longer-lasting energy. No jitters. No crash. (Not recommended for those sensitive to caffeine!)

If you’re curious, skeptical, or just love caffeine—come give us a shot. Your visit, feedback, or even a simple share means the world to a small business like ours trying to shake things up.
Our address is 
3401 Preston Rd #15 

Thanks for reading. I hope to see you Saturday.

I have an old Krups Espressaria EA8250 which has served me well for over 9 years and I’ve been very happy with. Recently it has started making noises and I’ve noticed the flavor of the brews is a little off.
I was going to get another super automatic with milk drink capabilities (Philips or Delonghi); but saw the KitchenAid semi-automatic KES6551 and was enthralled by its elegance and quietness.
As much as I’d like to be a hobbyist I don’t have the time or counter space - so the usual beginner setup recommendation is a no go. I want convenience but also solid flavor (love moka pot coffee, if that helps).

I’m looking at the Delonghi Magnifca Evo and the KitchenAid Semi-Automatic as my two options - I can get them for $440 and $400 respectively.

TLDR; I want to replace my current krups super automatic with either a Magnifica Evo or a KitchenAid semiautomatic. I’m looking for a balance of flavor, convenience and value.",2,1751384811.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Because of that little gesture, we ended up ordering more than just tea — some food and cold coffee too, just to show some love back. But when we went to pay, the staff said:

“Please don’t pay for your tea today, it’s from us.”

The Truth About Caffeine and PE,"Many of us grab a coffee before a date or a late-night meetup, thinking it’ll help with energy and mood. But if you’re struggling with premature ejaculation, it’s worth asking:

**Does caffeine actually make it harder to last longer in bed?**

**How Caffeine Affects Your Body Before Sex**

Caffeine is a stimulant that increases your heart rate, blood pressure, and adrenaline levels. This can be helpful for focus and alertness, but it also puts your body in a **mild “fight-or-flight” state.**

When you’re already excited or anxious before sex, adding caffeine to the mix can:

* Increase **nervous energy and tension**, making it harder to relax.
* Raise **arousal levels quickly**, pushing you closer to climax during penetration.
* Make your breathing shallow, reducing your ability to control arousal with deep, calm breaths.

**Does Caffeine Affect Everyone the Same Way?**

Not exactly. Some men don’t notice any change, while others feel jittery and overstimulated, leading to less control in bed. If you’re sensitive to caffeine and notice you get “twitchy” or anxious after coffee, it may also show up as less control during sex.

**Should You Skip Coffee Before Sex If You Have PE?**

If you find yourself finishing too quickly, it may be worth **testing how you perform without caffeine before sex.** You can try:

* Skipping coffee entirely on days you expect to have sex.
* Switching to herbal tea or decaf before intimacy.
* Having your last caffeinated drink earlier in the day instead of right before sex.

**A Real Example**

One user shared that he loved coffee and would have an espresso before dates, thinking it made him more confident. But he noticed he was more “on edge” during sex, with his arousal spiking too fast, leading to quick ejaculation.

After skipping coffee before sex for a few weeks, he found he felt calmer, breathed more deeply, and was able to last longer without the constant tension caffeine added.

**Takeaway**

Caffeine doesn’t directly cause PE, but it can **raise your arousal and tension levels, making it harder to manage your climax.** If you’re working on control, testing a caffeine break before sex might help you stay calmer and last longer.

Have you ever noticed a difference in control when you’ve had coffee vs. when you haven’t? Share your experience below—your story could help others figure out if caffeine is affecting their performance too.",1,1751384672.0,Overcome_PE,0,1.0,False
1lp51qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lp51qo/why_choose_the_zwilling_enfinigy_electric_kettle/,Why Choose the ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle for Your Kitchen?,"ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle 53101-500 is a product I’ve been using for the past few weeks, and it has truly redefined how I see electric kettles. With its sleek silver finish and cutting-edge features, it’s clearly designed for those of us who appreciate both style and function in our kitchen appliances. Being someone who relies on my morning coffee and afternoon tea to get through the day, a good electric kettle is essential, and this one does not disappoint. However, it’s not without its quirks, so let’s dive in and break it all down.

**A SLEEK DESIGN THAT CATCHES YOUR EYE**  
The first thing I noticed with this kettle was its aesthetic appeal. The matte silver exterior and modern silhouette give off a polished, premium vibe. As someone who pays attention to the look of my kitchen appliances, I was instantly drawn to its clean lines and the sense of durability it conveyed. The double-walled body not only adds to this aesthetic but makes it practical too. The cool touch feature ensures your hands are safe from any accidental burns—a thoughtful addition if you have little ones running around. It fits well on my countertop and doesn’t take up too much real estate, thanks to its compact dimensions: 10.3""L x 8.7""W x 12.9""H.  

**PERKS**  
- Double-walled design keeps water hot while staying cool to the touch.  
- Stylish silver matte finish that complements any modern kitchen.  
- Space-saving design with an integrated cable winder for neat storage.

**HIGH-PRECISION PERFORMANCE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS**  
This is where the product truly shines. With six pre-set temperature settings, you have precise control over the temperature you need for beverages or even baby formula. I loved how I could select the perfect heat for brewing delicate green tea or making a batch of French press coffee. The 30-minute keep-warm function was a unique addition I didn’t know I needed until the day I got distracted and remembered I had water waiting—still hot and just the right temperature. Add to that the German engineering and you’ve got a device that delivers on all fronts.  

[Check ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle 53101-500 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b085xlz4pg/)

**STAINLESS-STEEL INTERIOR: CLEAN AND HYGIENIC**  
One of my favorite features of the kettle is the seamless stainless-steel inside. It’s easy to clean, and I’ve yet to notice any residue build-up, unlike some electric kettles I’ve used in the past. The protective lid that opens only up to 70° keeps steam from hitting you directly—something I never realized the importance of until I used this kettle. Trust me, it’s the little things that make a big difference. For anyone who hates scrubbing their appliances after months of usage, this one will make your life much easier.  

**DRAWBACKS**  
- On the heavier side, weighing almost 5 pounds when filled.  
- The 30-minute keep-warm function feels short for long-term use.  
- Only available in one color; more options would have been nice.

**THE SAFETY FEATURES: A STEP AHEAD**  
Safety is often overlooked with kitchen appliances, but this kettle seems to have been designed with meticulous care. The cool-to-touch exterior is a lifesaver if you have kids who like to explore. Also, the protective lid design minimizes the risk of any accidents with steam escaping. I’ll admit I’ve had my fair share of small burns from older kettles, so this feature immediately earned my appreciation.  

**DIRECT COMPETITORS**  
When comparing this kettle to others in its range, the most obvious rivals are the Fellow Stagg EKG kettle and Breville Smart Kettle Luxe. While those also cater to premium users, the ZWILLING kettle stands out for combining high performance with a compact build. Its double-walled design is not standard in other models, which usually get hot to the touch. However, I think the Fellow kettle edges ahead when it comes to absolute temperature precision, but you’d miss out on the ZWILLING’s neat storage aspect and durable stainless interior. The Breville, on the other hand, often comes bulkier, which might not suit kitchens with limited space.

**QUALITY FOR PRICE**  
For its features and quality, this kettle feels like a worthwhile investment. Yes, it’s priced higher than basic models, but what you get is a premium piece of German engineering combined with Italian design. It strikes a good balance between practicality and high-end performance, making it stand out in my daily kitchen routine. If you’re someone who loves perfect coffee or tea and doesn’t mind spending a little extra for long-term durability, it’s definitely worth considering.

### **Chapter 2 – Panic & Traps**

---  

The rain eased to a drizzle by dawn, leaving behind the heavy scent of wet earth and rotting leaves. A thin fog drifted low over the coffee rows and mossy fences as Mouse and the crew set out, lanterns swinging, boots sinking into mud.

Blue Puppy darted ahead, wearing a yellow poncho two sizes too big, a homemade “*Chupacabra snare*” slung over his shoulder. It was a bizarre contraption of wire, pulleys, and a stuffed chicken as bait.

“This is it,” Blue Puppy whispered dramatically, eyes darting toward every rustle in the brush. “I’ve got the perfect spot.”

Minx trudged behind him, kicking at puddles. “You’re going to catch a raccoon.”

“I’ll catch *the Chupacabra*,” Blue Puppy corrected, eyes glinting.

Inspector Elephant followed, flipping a small waterproof notebook, scribbling down notes on the villagers’ testimonies while sipping coffee from a thermos. “Two goats with puncture wounds, blood missing, a third with claw marks but alive,” he muttered. “Footprints inconclusive.”

Featherstone lingered at the back of the group, peering nervously into the trees. He would occasionally crouch to inspect a frog hopping across the mud, muttering to himself, “Genetic drift… no, couldn’t be…”

Mouse, meanwhile, scanned the tree line, eyes sharp under the brim of his damp hat. The forest seemed alive with movement: a flicker of leaves, the flutter of a bird startled into the air, a flash of yellow eyes quickly disappearing deeper into the undergrowth.

They arrived at the edge of a clearing, where the grass was flattened and dark stains marked the mud. Remnants of fur clung to a low fence post, and Blue Puppy froze, nose twitching, tail quivering.

Mouse knelt, inspecting the ground. Two parallel punctures in the mud, and what looked like drag marks leading toward the forest.

“Looks like something was pulled under,” Mouse said quietly.

Minx checked her holster, glancing at the trees. “Or someone’s making it look that way.”

“Blue Puppy,” Mouse called. “Set your trap here.”

Blue Puppy dropped to work immediately, muttering excitedly about counterweights and tension settings, ignoring the fact that Minx was rolling her eyes so hard she might sprain something.

While Blue Puppy worked, Inspector Elephant pulled Mouse aside.

“You don’t really believe it’s a Chupacabra, do you?” Inspector Elephant asked, watching the treeline as a soft breeze rippled the fog.

“I believe people believe it,” Mouse replied. “That’s enough to get someone killed if we don’t calm this down.”

They fell silent as a scream echoed from the hills, distant but sharp enough to make Blue Puppy freeze with his paws tangled in wire. The scream came again—higher, panicked, and abruptly cut off.

Featherstone visibly flinched, clutching his folder to his chest. “That sounded… big.”

Mouse signaled with two fingers, and they moved quickly, following the sound up a muddy slope. Birds took off in clouds as they approached, and the forest grew thicker, vines clawing at their clothes.

They found a young man, one of the local farmhands, limping and clutching his arm, blood seeping between his fingers. His eyes were wild, face streaked with tears.

“It got me!” he shouted. “The *Chupacabra*—I saw it, eyes like fire—”

Mouse caught him before he collapsed, guiding him to sit against a tree while Minx examined the wound.

“Looks like a shallow scratch,” Minx said, tying a strip of cloth around it. “He probably ran through brambles.”

“I saw it!” the man insisted, trembling. “It was watching me!”

Featherstone shifted, eyes darting toward the undergrowth, mumbling, “Eyeshine could be a number of species…”

“Or a smuggler with a flashlight,” Minx added.

Blue Puppy was trembling with excitement, practically vibrating as he peered into the fog. “I *knew* it was real.”

Mouse placed a paw on the young man’s shoulder. “You’re safe now. Stay with Inspector Elephant and get back to the village.”

Inspector Elephant sighed, offering the man a thermos of coffee before helping him to his feet. As they started down the hill, Mouse turned back toward the forest, narrowing his eyes.

The mist moved again, and for a split second, he thought he saw something—low to the ground, dark, with a glint of yellow eyes—before it vanished into the undergrowth without a sound.

Blue Puppy caught Mouse’s look. “You saw it too, didn’t you?”

Mouse didn’t answer.

He just adjusted his hat, checked the safety on his sidearm, and led the crew deeper into the fog.

The forest was alive, and whatever was out there, it was watching them back.

### **Chapter 1 – The Arrival**

---  

Rain fell in steady sheets over the mountain roads of Puerto Rico, turning the jungle into a mist-laced labyrinth. A lone jeep rumbled up the gravel incline, headlights cutting through the darkness, frogs croaking like a restless chorus in the undergrowth. In the back seat, Blue Puppy pressed his snout against the glass, eyes wide as each shadow slipped past.

“They say it drinks the blood of goats,” Blue Puppy whispered, his breath fogging the window.

Mouse Capone, seated in the front, did not look up from his notepad. “They say a lot of things, kid. You think we’re here for a bedtime story?”

Blue Puppy turned, eyes gleaming. “I think we’re here to hunt monsters.”

Mouse’s ears twitched. “We’re here because the mayor’s check cleared.”

Lightning flashed, illuminating Minx leaning in the opposite corner, checking her nails, her boots propped up on a crate of old coffee beans they’d picked up as part of their “expedition logistics.” She didn’t look up. “It’d be convenient if it *was* a Chupacabra. Then we could pack up by sunrise and sell the rights to the highest bidder.”

Outside, the trees parted just enough to reveal the faint glow of lanterns strung across a muddy plaza. The town of **Santa Yaya** was little more than a collection of wooden houses pressed against the slope of a green mountain, mist draping it like a ghostly shawl. A cluster of villagers stood beneath umbrellas, waiting, arguing in hushed, tense voices.

Mouse stepped out first, pulling his jacket tighter as the rain found the back of his neck. He raised a paw, offering the mayor a tired but professional smile.

The mayor was a round man in a yellow poncho, his eyes puffy with worry, dark circles beneath them. “Señor Capone?” he called over the rain, hopeful. “We are so glad you came. It’s getting worse. Two more goats last night, drained—throats torn.”

Mouse glanced back at Minx, who was stepping down with theatrical boredom, and at Blue Puppy, who had already started sniffing the air as if expecting the monster to leap from the shadows. Featherstone, ever the academic mess, stumbled out last, adjusting a plastic rain hood and clutching a waterlogged folder of papers.

Behind them, another vehicle arrived, a battered green van that squeaked to a stop. From it stepped Inspector Elephant, wearing a straw hat too small for his head and carrying a clipboard, as if he’d planned to spend the entire week on a hammock but had been dragged into duty.

“Mouse,” Inspector Elephant grumbled, water dripping from his hat. “I’m on vacation.”

Mouse shrugged. “And yet here you are.”

The villagers herded them quickly under a tin awning where a single bulb flickered, illuminating damp faces and anxious eyes. An old woman crossed herself as she described the screams she’d heard in the night, another man swearing he’d seen *glowing eyes* by the fence line.

Blue Puppy’s tail wagged with each new terrifying detail. “This is it. This is *it*.”

Minx rolled her eyes. “Or a pack of hungry dogs.”

Featherstone shifted uneasily, his gaze darting toward the dripping jungle. Mouse noticed the professor’s sudden silence, a nervous twitch of the eye, a gloved hand tightening on that folder.

Mouse filed it away for later.

For now, he let the villagers vent their fear, let them point to the trees and whisper of monsters. The rain tapped on the tin roof in a steady rhythm, a slow drum that seemed to keep time with their growing paranoia.

Finally, Mouse cleared his throat.

“All right,” he said, “we’ll take a look. But everyone goes home for the night. No one wandering around with lanterns and rifles, understand? We don’t need more bodies on the ground.”

The mayor nodded, visibly relieved, and the villagers slowly dispersed, leaving the crew in the warm glow of the single bulb, surrounded by the scent of wet earth and coffee blossoms. In the distance, thunder rolled again, and the dark forest seemed to breathe, alive with secrets.

Mouse tucked his notepad away, turning to his crew.

“Welcome to Santa Yaya,” he said. “Let’s find out what’s eating these goats.”

Never had a relationship. I am introvert, shy, insecure. 6 months ago a girl randomly approached me on a gaming congress I visited on my own. She just suddenly was there. Like I said I am shy, introvert and insecure, but she made me feel comfortable so quickly. Still I have no idea why she approached me. We had such a nice talk and spend some of the day together. Than I asked her if she would like to meet another time maybe for a coffee or something. I really had to step out of my confort sone to ask that. It was pretty awkward.But as you read the title.... she said I have boyfriend sorry..... that was awful. She still gave me her number and instagram. She lives far away so I haven't seen her again. We still text sometimes about games and other stuff. 

Stupid part is that I can't really get over her. I really started to feel something for her and I think we are really compatible with each other. But she has a boyfriend. It absolutely kills me. I cannot stop thinking about her and what if? I still feel miserable. How do I get over this? I haven't really felt compatible or liked by any girl in the past. To me she feels like the only option.

In addition, there are extra rewards for the weekend coalition events if one is on an active enough team. 

Many online communities, big and small, have evolved on discord and other third-party platforms to overcome the limits of the in-game chat feature. These communities exist to support the tryhards fighting for the top ten in coalition events and are propped up by a _very wide foundation_ of more casual teams full of casual players. 

The best part? These communities exist as friendly rivals encouraging the others to do their best and making sure that important information spreads in a timely manner. I cannot count how many times I’ve avoided game-freezes in events because the “competition” has found and announced a bug to my group before I’ve even had my morning coffee. 

Please don’t be shy and worry whether or not you are good enough to join an active coalition—the groups all have their own algorithms for getting to the tippy top of the ranks but there is absolutely room for everyone else _somewhere._ Today’s new player may be tomorrow’s star player!

You should expect _any_ of the groups to have friendly and helpful experts eager to show off how clever they are about the game. You should expect to be treated kindly and know that creeps will not be tolerated. And you should expect to see an increase in the rewards you earn each week as well as better clarity on how best to make use of those resources. 

Aside from that, each group has their own vibe so if one isn’t a good fit, absolutely try as many as you like until you find the one that’s just right! There’s a fair amount of overlap in the servers to facilitate the distribution of information about the game. 

TL;DR Yes, you should join an active coalition and a discord server! You will get lots of prizes and advice and people to geek out with. No, it doesn’t really matter which one.",1,1751384315.0,MTGPuzzleQuest,1,1.0,False

Because of that little gesture, we ended up ordering more than just tea — some food and cold coffee too, just to show some love back. But when we went to pay, the staff said:

“Please don’t pay for your tea today, it’s from us.”

I got some Tanzanian honey coffee that is taking significantly longer to brew, I think it's stalling, first cup was more than 3 minutes. The flavor came out very sour. My instinct from sour coffee is to grind finer as it's underextracted, but my instinct from very long brew time is to grind coarser to prevent the stall. I did try another cup where I backed off the grind size some clicks, and the brew time came down (still a little high), but it's still sour.

1lp4r3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lp4r3o/boys_life_by_robert_mccammon/,Boys Life by Robert McCammon:," I let him pull me up from the dark cavern of sleep, and I opened my eyes and looked up at him. He was already dressed, in his dark brown uniform with his name-Tom-written in white letters across his breast pocket. I smelled bacon and eggs, and the radio was playing softly in the kitchen. a pan rattled and glasses clinked; Mom was at work in her element as surely as a trout rides a current. ""It's time,"" my father said, and he switched on the lamp beside my bed and left me squinting with the last images of a dream fading in my brain.  
  
  The sun wasn't up yet. It was mid-March, and a chill wind blew through the trees beyond my window. I could feel the wind by putting my hand against the glass. Mom, realizing that I was awake when my dad went in for his cup of coffee, turned the radio up a little louder to catch the weather report. Spring had sprung a couple of days before, but this year winter had sharp teeth and nails and he clung to the South like a white cat. We hadn't had snow, we never had snow, but the wind was chill and it blew hard from the lungs of the Pole.  
  
  ""Heavy sweater!"" Mom called. ""Heari""  
  
  ""I hear!"" I answered back, and I got my green heavy sweater from my dresser. Here is my room, in the yellow lamplight and the space heater rumbling: Indian rug red as Cochise's blood, a desk with seven mystic drawers, a chair covered in material as velvety blue-black as Batman's cape, an aquarium holding tiny fish so pale you could see their hearts beat, the aforementioned dresser covered with decals from Revell model airplane kits, a bed with a quilt sewn by a relative of Jefferson Davis's, a closet, and the shelves. Oh, yes, the shelves. The troves of treasure. On those shelves are stacks of me: hundreds of comic books-Justice League, Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, the Spirit, Blackhawk, Sgt. Rock and Easy Company, aquaman, and the Fantastic Four. There are Boy's Life magazines, dozens of issues of Famous Monsters of Filmland, Screen Thrills, and Popular Mechanics. There is a yellow wall of National Geographics, and I have to blush and say I know where all the african pictures are.  
  
  The shelves go on for miles and miles. My collection of marbles gleams in a mason jar. My dried cicada waits to sing again in summer. My Duncan yo-yo that whistles except the string is broken and Dad's got to fix it. My little book of suit cloth samples that I got from Mr. Parlowe at the Stagg Shop for Men. I use those pieces of cloth as carpet inside my airplane models, along with seats cut from cardboard. My silver bullet, forged by the Lone Ranger for a werewolf hunter. My Civil War button that fell from a butternut uniform when the storm swept Shiloh. My rubber knife for stalking killer crocodiles in the bathtub. My Canadian coins, smooth as the northern plains. I am rich beyond measure.  
  
  ""Breakfast's on!"" Mom called. I zipped up my sweater, which was the same hue as Sgt. Rock's ripped shirt. My blue jeans had patches on the knees, like badges of courage marking encounters with barbed wire and gravel. My flannel shirt was red enough to stagger a bull. My socks were white as dove wings and my Keds midnight black. My mom was color-blind, and my dad thought checks went with plaid. I was all right.  
  
  It's funny, sometimes, when you look at the people who brought you into this world and you see yourself so clearly in them. You realize that every person in the world is a compromise of nature. I had my mother's small-boned frame and her wavy, dark brown hair, but my father had given me his blue eyes and his sharp-bridged nose. I had my mother's long-fingered hands-an ""artist's hands,"" she used to tell me when I fretted that my fingers were so skinny-and my dad's thick eyebrows and the small cleft in his chin. I wished that some nights I would go to sleep and awaken resembling a man's man like Stuart Whitman in Cimarron Strip or Clint Walker in Cheyenne, but the truth of it was that I was a skinny, gawky kid of average height and looks, and I could blend into wallpaper by closing my eyes and holding my breath. In my fantasies, though, I tracked lawbreakers along with the cowboys and detectives who paraded past us nightly on our television set, and out in the woods that came up behind our house I helped Tarzan call the lions and shot Nazis down in a solitary war. I had a small group of friends, guys like Johnny Wilson, Davy Ray Callan, and Ben Sears, but I wasn't what you might call popular. Sometimes I got nervous talking to people and my tongue got tangled, so I stayed quiet. My friends and I were about the same in size, age, and temperament; we avoided what we could not fight, and we were all pitiful fighters.  
  
  This is where I think the writing started. The ""righting,"" if you will. The righting of circumstances, the shaping of the world the way it should have been, had God not had crossed eyes and buck teeth. In the real world I had no power; in my world I was Hercules unchained.  
  
  One thing I do know I got from my granddaddy Jaybird, my dad's father: his curiosity about the world. He was seventy-six years old and as tough as beef jerky, and he had a foul mouth and an even fouler disposition, but he was always prowling the woods around his farm. He brought home things that made Grandmomma Sarah swoon: snake-skins, empty hornets' nests, even animals he'd found dead. He liked to cut things open with a penknife and look at their insides, arranging all their bloody guts out on newspapers.  
  
  One time he hung up a dead toad from a tree and invited me to watch the flies eat it with him. He brought home a burlap sack full of leaves, dumped them in the front room, and examined each of them with a magnifying glass, writing down their differences in one of his hundreds of Nifty notebooks. He collected cigar butts and dried spits of chewing tobacco, which he kept in glass vials. He could sit for hours in the dark and look at the moon.  
  
  Maybe he was crazy. Maybe crazy is what they call anybody who's got magic in them after they're no longer a child. But Granddaddy Jaybird read the Sunday comics to me, and he told me stories about the haunted house in the small hamlet of his birth. Granddaddy Jaybird could be mean and stupid and petty, but he lit a candle of wonder in me and by that light I could see a long way beyond Zephyr.  
  
  On that morning before the sun, as I sat eating my breakfast with my dad and mom in our house on Hilltop Street, the year was 1964. There were great changes in the winds of earth, things of which I was unaware. all I knew at that moment was that I needed another glass of orange juice, and that I was going to help my dad on his route before he took me to school. So when breakfast was over and the dishes were cleared, after I had gone out into the cold to say good morning to Rebel and feed him his Gravy Train, Mom kissed both Dad and me, I put on my fleece-lined jacket and got my schoolbooks and off we went in the coughy old pickup truck. Freed from his backyard pen, Rebel followed us a distance, but at the corner of Hilltop and Shawson streets he crossed into the territory of Bodog, the Doberman pinscher that belonged to the Ramseys, and he beat a diplomatic retreat to a drumroll of barks.  
  
  and there was Zephyr before us, the town quiet in its dreaming, the moon a white sickle in the sky.  
  
  a few lights were on. Not many. It wasn't five o'clock yet. The sickle moon glittered in the slow curve of the Tecumseh River, and if Old Moses swam there he swam with his leathery belly kissing mud. The trees along Zephyr's streets were still without leaves, and their branches moved with the wind. The traffic lights-all four of them at what might be called major intersections-blinked yellow in a steady accord. To the east, a stone bridge with brooding gargoyles crossed the wide hollow where the river ran. Some said the faces of the gargoyles, carved in the early twenties, were representations of various Confederate generals, fallen angels, as it were. To the west, the highway wound into the wooded hills and on toward other towns. a railroad track cut across Zephyr to the north, right through the Bruton area, where all the black people lived. In the south was the public park where a bandshell stood and a couple of baseball diamonds had been cut into  
the earth. The park was named for Clifford Gray Haines, who founded Zephyr, and there was a statue of him sitting on a rock with his chin resting on his hand. My dad said it looked as if Clifford was perpetually constipated and could neither do his business nor get off the pot. Farther south, Route Ten left Zephyr's limits and wound like a black cottonmouth past swampy woods, a trailer park, and Saxon's Lake, which shelved into unknown depths.  
  
  Dad turned us onto Merchants Street, and we drove through the center of Zephyr, where the stores were. There was Dollar's Barbershop, the Stagg Shop for Men, the Zephyr Feeds and Hardware Store, the Piggly-Wiggly grocery, the Woolworth's store, the Lyric theater, and other attractions along the sidewalked thoroughfare. It wasn't much, though; if you blinked a few times, you were past it. Then Dad crossed the railroad track, drove another two miles, and turned into a gate that had a sign above it: GREEN MEaDOWS DaIRY. The milk trucks were at the loading dock, getting filled up. Here there was a lot of activity, because Green Meadows Dairy opened early and the milkmen had their appointed rounds.  
  
  Sometimes when my father had an especially busy schedule, he asked me to help him with his deliveries. I liked the silence and stillness of the mornings. I liked the world before the sun. I liked finding out what different people ordered from the dairy. I don't know why; maybe that was my granddaddy Jaybird's curiosity in me.  
  
  My dad went over a checklist with the foreman, a big crew-cut man named Mr. Bowers, and then Dad and I started loading our truck. Here came the bottles of milk, the cartons of fresh eggs, buckets of cottage cheese and Green Meadows' special potato and bean salads. Everything was still cold from the ice room, and the milk bottles sparkled with frost under the loading dock's lights. Their paper caps bore the face of a smiling milkman and the words ""Good for You!"" as we were working, Mr. Bowers came up and watched with his clipboard at his side and his pen behind his ear. ""You think you'd like to be a milkman, Coryi"" he asked me, and I said I might. ""The world'll always need milkmen,"" Mr. Bowers went on. ""Isn't that right, Tomi""  
  
  ""Right as rain,"" my dad said; this was an all-purpose phrase he used when he was only half listening.  
  
  ""You come apply when you turn eighteen,"" Mr. Bowers told me. ""We'll fix you up. "" He gave me a clap on the shoulder that almost rattled my teeth and did rattle the bottles in the tray I was carrying.  
  
  Then Dad climbed behind the big-spoked wheel, I got into the seat next to him, he turned the key, and the engine started and we backed away from the loading dock with our creamy cargo. ahead of us, the moon was sinking down and the last of the stars hung on the lip of night. ""What about thati"" Dad asked. ""Being a milkman, I mean. That appeal to youi""  
  
  ""It'd be fun,"" I said.  
  
  ""Not really. Oh, it's okay, but no job's fun every day. I guess we've never talked about what you want to do, have wei""  
  
  ""No sir. ""  
  
  ""Well, I don't think you ought to be a milkman just because that's what I do. See, I didn't start out to be a milkman. Granddaddy Jaybird wanted me to be a farmer like him. Grandmomma Sarah wanted me to be a doctor. Can you imagine thati"" He glanced at me and grinned. ""Me, a doctor! Doctor Tom! No sir, that wasn't for me. ""  
  
  ""What'd you start out to bei"" I asked.  
  
  My dad was quiet for a while. He seemed to be thinking this question over, in a deep place. It occurred to me that maybe no one had ever asked him this before. He gripped the spoked wheel with his grown-up hands and negotiated the road that unwound before us in the headlights, and then he said, ""First man on Venus. Or a rodeo rider. Or a man who can look at an empty space and see in his mind the house he wants to build there right down to the last nail and shingle. Or a detective. "" My dad made a little laughing noise in his throat. ""But the dairy needed another milkman, so here I am. ""  
  
  ""I wouldn't mind bein' a race car driver,"" I said. My dad sometimes took me to the stock car races at the track near Barnesboro, and we sat there eating hot dogs and watching sparks fly in the collision of banged-up metal. ""Bein' a detective would be okay, too. I'd get to solve mysteries and stuff, like the Hardy Boys. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, that'd be good,"" my dad agreed. ""You never know how things are gonna turn out, though, and that's the truth. You aim for one place, sure as an arrow, but before you hit the mark, the wind gets you. I don't believe I ever met one person who became what they wanted to be when they were your age. ""  
  
  ""I'd like to be everybody in the world,"" I said. ""I'd like to live a million times. ""  
  
  ""Well""-and here my father gave one of his sagely nods-""that would be a fine piece of magic, wouldn't iti"" He pointed. ""Here's our first stop. ""  
  
  That first house must've had children in it, because they got two quarts of chocolate milk to go along with their two quarts of plain milk. Then we were off again, driving through the streets where the only sounds were the wind and the barking of early dogs, and we stopped on Shantuck Street to deliver buttermilk and cottage cheese to somebody who must've liked things sour. We left bottles glistening on the steps of most of the houses on Bevard Lane, and my dad worked fast as I checked off the list and got the next items ready from the chilly back of the truck; we were a good team.  
  
  Dad said he had some customers down south near Saxon's Lake and then he'd swing back up so we could finish the rest of the street deliveries before my school bell rang. He drove us past the park and out of Zephyr, and the forest closed in on either side of the road.  
  
  It was getting on toward six o'clock. To the east, over the hills of pine and kudzu, the sky was beginning to lighten. The wind shoved its way through the trees like the fist of a bully. We passed a car going north, and its driver blinked the lights and Dad waved. ""Marty Barklee deliverin' the newspapers,"" Dad told me. I thought about the fact that there was a whole world going about its business before the sun, and people who were just waking up weren't part of it. We turned off Route Ten and drove up a dirt drive to deliver milk, buttermilk, and potato salad to a small house nestled in the woods, and then we went south toward the lake again. ""College,"" my dad said. ""You ought to go to college, it seems to me. ""  
  
  ""I guess so,"" I answered, but that sounded like an awful long distance from where I was now. all I knew about college was auburn and alabama football, and the fact that some people praised Bear Bryant and others worshipped Shug Jordan. It seemed to me that you chose which college to go to according to which coach you liked best.  
  
  ""Gotta have good grades to get into college,"" Dad said. ""Gotta study your lessons. ""  
  
  ""Do detectives have to go to collegei""  
  
  ""I reckon they do if they want to be professional about it. If I'd gone to college, I might've turned out to be that man who builds a house in empty space. You never know what's ahead for you, and that's the-""  
  
  Truth, he was about to say, but he never finished it because we came around a wooded bend and a brown car jumped out of the forest right in front of us and Dad yelped like he was hornet-stung as his foot punched the brake.  
  
  The brown car went past us as Dad whipped the wheel to the left, and I saw that car go off Route Ten and down the embankment on my right. Its lights weren't on but there was somebody sitting behind the wheel. The car's tires tore through the underbrush and then it went over a little cliff of red rock and down into the dark. Water splashed up, and I realized the car had just plunged into Saxon's Lake.  
  
  ""He went in the water!"" I shouted, and Dad stopped the milk truck, pulled up the hand brake, and jumped out into the roadside weeds. as I climbed out, Dad was already running toward the lake. The wind whipped and whirled around us, and Dad stood there on the red rock cliff. By the faint pinkish light we could see the car wallowing in the water, huge bubbles bursting around its trunk. ""Hey!"" Dad shouted with his hands cupped around his mouth. ""Get out of there!"" Everybody knew Saxon's Lake was as deep as sin, and when that car went down into the inky depths it was gone for good and ever. ""Hey, get out!"" Dad shouted again, but whoever was behind the wheel didn't answer. ""I think he's been knocked cold!"" Dad told me as he took off his shoes. The car  
was starting to turn onto its passenger side, and there was an awful howling sound coming from it that must've been the rush of water pouring into the car. Dad said, ""Stand back. "" I did, and he leaped into the lake.  
  
  He was a strong swimmer. He reached the car in a few powerful strokes, and he saw that the driver's window was open. He could feel the suction of water moving around his legs, drawing the car down into the unfathomed deep. ""Get out!"" he hollered, but the driver just sat there. Dad clung to the door, reached in, and grabbed the driver's shoulder. It was a man, and he wore no shirt. The flesh was white and cold, and my dad felt his own skin crawl. The man's head lolled back, his mouth open. He had short-cropped blond hair, his eyes sealed shut with black bruises, his face swollen and malformed from the pressures of a savage beating. around his throat was knotted a copper piano wire, the thin metal pulled so tightly that the flesh had split open.  
  
  ""Oh Jesus,"" my dad whispered, treading water.  
  
  The car lurched and hissed. The head lolled forward over the chest again, as if in an attitude of prayer. Water was rising up over the driver's bare knees. My dad realized the driver was naked, not a stitch on him. Something glinted on the steering wheel, and he saw handcuffs that secured the man's right wrist to the inner spoke.  
  
  My dad had lived thirty-four years. He'd seen dead men before. Hodge Klemson, one of his best friends, had drowned in the Tecumseh River when they were both fifteen years old, and the body had been found after three days bloated and covered with yellow bottom mud like a crusty ancient mummy. He'd seen what remained of Walter and Jeanine Traynor after the head-on collision six years ago between Walter's Buick and a logging truck driven by a kid eating pep pills. He'd seen the dark shiny mass of Little Stevie Cauley after firemen doused the flames of the crumpled black dragster named Midnight Mona. He had looked upon the grinning rictus of death several times, had taken that sight like a man, but this one was different.  
  
  This one wore the face of murder.  
  
  The car was going down. as its hood sank, its tail fins started rising. The body behind the wheel shifted again, and my father saw something on the man's shoulder. a blue patch, there against the white. Not a bruise, no; a tattoo. It was a skull with wings swept back from the bony temples.  
  
  a great burst of bubbles blew out of the car as more water rushed in. The lake would not be denied; it was going to claim its toy and tuck it away in a secret drawer. as the car began to slide down into the murk, the suction grabbed my father's legs and pulled him under, and standing on the red rock cliff I saw his head disappear and I shouted ""Dad!"" as panic seized my guts.  
  
  Underwater, he fought the lake's muscles. The car fell away beneath him, and as his legs thrashed for a hold in the liquid tomb, more bubbles rushed up and broke him loose and he climbed up their silver staircase toward the attic of air.  
  
  I saw his head break the surface. ""Dad!"" I shouted again. ""Come on back, Dad!""  
  
  ""I'm all right!"" he answered, but his voice was shaky. ""I'm comin' in!"" He began dog-paddling toward shore, his body suddenly as weak as a squeezed-out rag. The lake continued to erupt where the car disturbed its innards, like something bad being digested. Dad couldn't get up the red rock cliff, so he swam to a place where he could clamber up on kudzu vines and stones. ""I'm all right!"" he said again as he came out of the lake and his legs sank to the knees in mud. a turtle the size of a dinner plate skittered past him and submerged with a perplexed snort. I glanced back toward the milk truck; I don't know why, but I did.  
  
  and I saw a figure standing in the woods across the road.  
  
  Just standing there, wearing a long dark coat. Its folds moved with the wind. Maybe I'd felt the eyes of whoever was watching me as I'd watched my father swim to the sinking car. I shivered a little, bone cold, and then I blinked a couple of times and where the figure had been was just windswept woods again.  
  
  ""Coryi"" my dad called. ""Gimme a hand up, son!""  
  
  I went down to the muddy shore and gave him as much help as a cold, scared child could. Then his feet found solid earth and he pushed the wet hair back from his forehead. ""Gotta get to a phone,"" he said urgently. ""There was a man in that car. Went straight down to the bottom!""  
  
  ""I saw. . . I saw. . . "" I pointed toward the woods on the other side of Route Ten. ""Somebody was-""  
  
  ""Come on, let's go!"" My father was already crossing the road with his sturdy, soggy legs, his shoes in his hand. I jump-started my own legs and followed him as close as a shadow, and my gaze returned to where I'd seen that figure but nobody was there, nobody, nobody at all.  
  
  Dad started the milk truck's engine and switched on the heater. His teeth were chattering, and in the gray twilight his face looked as pale as candle wax. ""Damnedest thing,"" he said, and this shocked me because he never cursed in front of me. ""Handcuffed to the wheel, he was. Handcuffed. My God, that fella's face was all beat up!""  
  
  ""Who was iti""  
  
  ""I don't know. "" He turned the heater up, and then he started driving south toward the nearest house. ""Somebody did a job on him, that's for sure! Lord, I'm cold!""  
  
  a dirt road turned to the right, and my father followed it. Fifty yards off Route Ten stood a small white house with a screened-in front porch. a rose garden stood off to one side. Parked under a green plastic awning were two cars, one a red Mustang and the other an old Cadillac splotched with rust. My dad pulled up in front of the house and said, ""Wait here,"" and he walked to the door in his wet socks and rang the bell. He had to ring it two more times before the door opened with a tinkle of chimes, and a red-haired woman who made three of my mom stood there wearing a blue robe with black flowers on it.  
  
  Dad said, ""Miss Grace, I need to use your telephone real quick. ""  
  
  ""You're all wet!"" Miss Grace's voice sounded like the rasp of a rusty saw blade. She gripped a cigarette in one hand, and rings sparkled on her fingers.  
  
  ""Somethin' bad's happened,"" Dad told her, and she sighed like a redheaded raincloud and said, ""all right, come on in, then. Watch the carpet. "" Dad entered the house, the chimey door closed, and I sat in the milk truck as the first orange rays of sunlight started breaking over the eastern hills. I could smell the lake in the truck with me, a puddle of water on the floorboard beneath my father's seat. I had seen somebody standing in the woods. I knew I had. Hadn't Ii Why hadn't he come over to see about the man in the cari and who had the man in the car beeni  
  
  I was puzzling over these questions when the door opened again and Miss Grace came out, this time wearing a floppy white sweater over her blue gown. She had on sneakers, her ankles and calves thick as young trees. She had a box of Lorna Doone cookies in one hand and the burning cigarette in the other, and she walked to the milk truck and smiled at me. ""Hey there,"" she said. ""You're Cory. ""  
  
  ""Yes'm,"" I answered.  
  
  Miss Grace didn't have much of a smile. Her lips were thin and her nose was broad and flat and her brows were black-penciled streaks above deep-set blue eyes. She thrust the Lorna Doones at me. ""Want a cookiei""  
  
  I wasn't hungry, but my folks had always taught me never to refuse a gift. I took one.  
  
  ""Have two,"" Miss Grace offered, and I took a second cookie. She ate a cookie herself and then sucked on the cigarette and blew smoke through her nostrils. ""Your daddy's our milkman,"" she said. ""I believe you've got us on your list. Six quarts of milk, two buttermilks, two chocolates, and three pints of cream. ""  
  
  I checked the list. There was her name-Grace Stafford-and the order, just as she'd said. I told her I'd get everything for her, and I started putting the order together. ""How old are youi"" Miss Grace asked as I worked. ""Twelvei""  
  
  ""No, ma'am. Not until July. ""  
  
  ""I've got a son. "" Miss Grace knocked ashes from her cigarette. She chewed on another cookie. ""Turned twenty in December. He lives in San antonio. Know where that isi""  
  
  ""Yes ma'am. Texas. Where the alamo is. ""  
  
  ""That's right. Turned twenty, which makes me thirty-eight. I'm an old fossil, ain't Ii""  
  
  This was a trick que  
stion, I thought. ""No ma'am,"" I decided to say.  
  
  ""Well, you're a little diplomat, ain't youi"" She smiled again, and this time the smile was in her eyes. ""Have another cookie. "" She left me the box and walked to the door, and she hollered into the house: ""Lainie! Lainie, get your butt up and come out here!""  
  
  My dad emerged first. He looked old in the hard light of morning, and there were dark circles under his eyes. ""Called the sheriff's office,"" he told me as he sat in his wet seat and squeezed his feet into his shoes. ""Somebody's gonna meet us where the car went in. ""  
  
  ""Who the hell was iti"" Miss Grace asked.  
  
  ""I couldn't tell. His face was. . . "" He glanced quickly at me, then back to the woman. ""He was beat up pretty bad. ""  
  
  ""Must've been drunk. Moonshinin', most likely. ""  
  
  ""I don't think so. "" Dad hadn't said anything over the phone about the car's driver being naked, strangled with a piano wire, and handcuffed to the wheel. That was for the sheriff and not for Miss Grace's or anybody else's ears. ""You ever see a fella with a tattoo on his left shoulderi Looked like a skull with wings growin' out of its headi""  
  
  ""I've seen more tattoos than the Navy,"" Miss Grace said, ""but I can't recall anything like that around here. Whyi Fella have his shirt off or somethin'i""  
  
  ""Yeah, he did. Had that skull with wings tattooed right about here. "" He touched his left shoulder. Dad shivered again, and rubbed his hands together. ""They'll never bring that car up. Never. Saxon's Lake is three hundred feet deep if it's an inch. ""  
  
  The chimes sounded. I looked toward the door with the tray of milk quarts in my arms.  
  
  a girl with sleep-swollen eyes stumbled out. She was wearing a long plaid bathrobe and her feet were bare. Her hair was the color of cornsilk and hung around her shoulders, and as she neared the milk truck she blinked in the light and said, ""I'm all fucked up. ""  
  
  I think I must've almost fallen down, because never in my life had I heard a female use a word that dirty before. Oh, I knew what the word meant and all, but its casual use from a pretty mouth shocked the fool out of me.  
  
  ""There's a young man on the premises, Lainie,"" Miss Grace said in a voice that could curl an iron nail. ""Watch your language, please. ""  
  
  Lainie looked at me, and her cool stare made me recall the time I'd put a fork in an electric socket. Lainie's eyes were chocolate brown and her lips seemed to wear a half smile, half sneer. Something about her face looked tough and wary, as if she'd run out of trust. There was a small red mark in the hollow of her throat. ""Who's the kidi"" she asked.  
  
  ""Mr. Mackenson's son. Show some class, heari""  
  
  I swallowed hard and averted my eyes from Lainie's. Her robe was creeping open. It hit me what kind of girl used bad words, and what kind of place this was. I had heard from both Johnny Wilson and Ben Sears that there was a house full of whores somewhere near Zephyr. It was common knowledge at the elementary school. When you told somebody to ""go suck a whore,"" you were standing right on the razor's edge of violence. I'd always imagined the whorehouse to be a mansion, though, with drooping willow trees and black servants who fetched the customers mint juleps on the front porch; the reality, however, was that the whorehouse wasn't much of a step up from a broken-down trailer. Still and all, here it was right in front of me, and the girl with cornsilk hair and a dirty mouth earned her living by the pleasures of the flesh. I felt goose bumps ripple up my back, and I can't tell you the kind of scenes that moved like a slow, dangerous storm through my head.  
  
  ""Take that milk and stuff to the kitchen,"" Miss Grace told her.  
  
  The sneer won out over the smile, and those brown eyes turned black. ""I ain't got kitchen duty! It's Donna ann's week!""  
  
  ""It's whose week I say it is, missy, and you know why I ought to put you in the kitchen for a whole month, too! Now, you do what I tell you and keep your smart mouth shut!""  
  
  Lainie's lips drew up into a puckered, practiced pout. But her eyes did not register the chastisement so falsely; they held cold centers of anger. She took the tray from me, and standing with her back to my dad and Miss Grace, she stuck out her wet pink tongue in my face and curled it up into a funnel. Then the tongue slicked back into her mouth, she turned away from me, and dismissed all of us with a buttstrut that was as wicked as a sword slash. She swayed on into the house, and after Lainie was gone Miss Grace grunted and said, ""She's as rough as a cob. ""  
  
  ""aren't they alli"" Dad asked, and Miss Grace blew a smoke ring and answered, ""Yeah, but she don't even pretend she's got manners. "" Her gaze settled on me. ""Cory, why don't you keep the cookies. all righti""  
  
  I looked at Dad. He shrugged. ""Yes, ma'am,"" I said.  
  
  ""Good. It was a real pleasure to meet you. "" Miss Grace returned her attention to my father and the cigarette to the corner of her mouth. ""Let me know how everything turns out. ""  
  
  ""I will, and thanks for lettin' me use the phone. "" He slid behind the wheel again. ""I'll pick up the milk tray next trip. ""  
  
  ""Ya'll be careful,"" Miss Grace said, and she went into the white-painted whorehouse as Dad started the engine and let off the hand brake.  
  
  We drove back to where the car had gone in. Saxon's Lake was streaked with blue and purple in the morning light. Dad pulled the milk truck off onto a dirt road; the road, both of us realized, was where the car had come from. Then we sat and waited for the sheriff as the sunlight strengthened and the sky turned azure.  
  
  Sitting there, my mind was split: one part was thinking about the car and the figure I thought I'd seen, and the other part was wondering how my dad knew Miss Grace at the whorehouse so well. But Dad knew all of his customers; he talked about them to Mom at the dinner table. I never recalled him mentioning Miss Grace or the whorehouse, however. Well, it wasn't a proper subject for the dinner table, was iti and anyway, they wouldn't talk about such things when I was around, even though all my friends and everybody else at school from the fourth grade up knew there was a house full of bad girls somewhere around Zephyr.  
  
  I had been there. I had actually seen a bad girl. I had seen her curled tongue and her butt move in the folds of her robe.  
  
  That, I figured, was going to make me one heck of a celebrity.  
  
  ""Coryi"" my father said quietly. ""Do you know what kind of business Miss Grace runs in that housei""  
  
  ""I. . . "" Even a third-grader could've figured it out. ""Yes sir. ""  
  
  ""any other day, I would've just left the order by the front door. "" He was staring at the lake, as if seeing the car still tumbling slowly down through the depths with a handcuffed corpse at the wheel. ""Miss Grace has been on my delivery route for two years. Every Monday and Thursday, like clockwork. In case it's crossed your mind, your mother does know I come out here. ""  
  
  I didn't answer, but I felt a whole lot lighter.  
  
  ""I don't want you to tell anybody about Miss Grace or that house,"" my father went on. ""I want you to forget you were there, and what you saw and heard. Can you do thati""  
  
  ""Whyi"" I had to ask.  
  
  ""Because Miss Grace might be a lot different than you, me, or your mother, and she might be tough and mean and her line of work might not be a preacher's dream, but she's a good lady. I just don't want talk gettin' stirred up. The less said about Miss Grace and that house, the better. Do you seei""  
  
  ""I guess I do. ""  
  
  ""Good. "" He flexed his fingers on the steering wheel. The subject was closed.  
  
  I was true to my word. My celebrityhood took flight, and that was that.  
  
  I was about to open my mouth to tell him about the figure I'd seen in the woods when a black and white Ford with a bubble light on top and the town seal of Zephyr on the driver's door rounded the corner and slowed to a stop near the milk truck. Sheriff amory, whose first name was J. T. , standing for Junior Talmadge, got out and Dad walked over to meet him.  
  
  Sheriff amory was a thin, tall man whose long-jawed face made me think of a picture I'd seen: Ichabod Crane trying to outrace the Headless Horseman. He had big hands and feet and a pair of ears that might've shamed Dumbo  
. If his nose had been any larger, he would've made a dandy weather-vane. He wore his sheriff's star pinned to the front of his hat, and underneath it his dome was almost bald except for a wreath of dark brown hair. He pushed his hat back up on his shiny forehead as he and my dad talked at the lake's edge and I watched my father's hand motions as he showed Sheriff amory where the car had come from and where it had gone. Then they both looked out toward the lake's still surface, and I knew what they were thinking.  
  
  That car might've sunken to the center of the earth. Even the snapping turtles that lived along the lakeshore couldn't get far enough down to ever see that car again. Whoever the driver had been, he was sitting in the dark right now with mud in his teeth.  
  
  ""Handcuffed,"" Sheriff amory said, in his quiet voice. He had thick dark eyebrows over deep-set eyes the color of coal, and the pallor of his flesh suggested he had an affinity to the night. ""You're sure about that, Tomi and about the wire, tooi""  
  
  ""I'm sure. Whoever strangled that fella did a hell of a job. Near about took his head off. ""  
  
  ""Handcuffed,"" the sheriff said again. ""That was so he wouldn't float out, I reckon. "" He tapped his lower lip with a forefinger. ""Well,"" he said at last, ""I believe we've got a murder on our hands, don't youi""  
  
  ""If it wasn't, I don't know what murder is. ""  
  
  as they talked, I got out of the milk truck and wandered over to where I thought I'd seen that person watching me. There was nothing but weeds, rocks, and dirt where he'd been standing. If it had been a man, I thought. Could it have been a womani I hadn't seen long hair, but then again I hadn't seen much of anything but a coat swirling in the wind. I walked back and forth along the line of trees. Beyond it, the woods deepened and swampy ground took over. I found nothing.  
  
  ""Better come on to the office and let me write it up,"" the sheriff told my father. ""If you want to go home and get some dry clothes on, that'd be fine. ""  
  
  My dad nodded. ""I've got to finish my deliveries and get Cory to school, too. ""  
  
  ""Okay. Seems to me we can't do much for that fella at the bottom, anyhow. "" He grunted, his hands in his pockets. ""a murder. Last murder we had in Zephyr was in 1961. You remember when Bo Kallagan beat his wife to death with a bowlin' trophyi""  
  
  I returned to the milk truck and waited for my dad. The sun was up good and proper now, lighting the world. Or, at least, the world I knew. But things weighed heavy on my mind. It seemed to me that there were two worlds: one before the sun, and one after. and if that were true, then maybe there were people who were citizens of those different worlds as well. Some moved easily through the landscape of night, and others clung to the bright hours. Maybe I had seen one of those darktime citizens, in the world before the sun. and-a chilling thought-maybe he had seen me seeing him, too.  
  
  I realized I had brought mud back into the milk truck. It was smeared all over my Keds.  
  
  I looked at the soles, and the earth I had collected.  
  
  On the bottom of my left Ked was a small green feather.  
Chapter Two  
  
   
  
  II - Down in the Dark  
  
  THE GREEN FEaTHER WENT INTO MY POCKET. FROM THERE IT found its way into a White Owl cigar box in my room, along with my collection of old keys and dried-up insects. I closed the box lid, placed the box in one of the seven mystic drawers, and slid the drawer shut.  
  
  and that was how I forgot about it.  
  
  The more I thought about seeing that figure at the edge of the woods, the more I thought I'd been wrong, that my eyes had been scared from seeing Dad sink underwater as the car went down. Several times I started to tell Dad about it, but something else got in the way. Mom threw a gut-busting fit when she found out he'd jumped into the lake. She was so mad at him she sobbed as she yelled, and Dad had to sit her down at the kitchen table and explain to her calmly why he had done it. ""There was a man at the wheel,"" Dad said. ""I didn't know he was already dead, I thought he was knocked cold. If I'd stood there without doing anything, what would I have thought of myself after it was overi""  
  
  ""You could've drowned!"" she fired at him, tears on her cheeks. ""You could've hit your head on a rock and drowned!""  
  
  ""I didn't drown. I didn't hit my head on a rock. I did what I had to do. "" He gave her a paper napkin, and she used it to blot her eyes. a last salvo came out of her: ""That lake's full of cottonmouths! You could've swum right into a nest of 'em!""  
  
  ""I didn't,"" he said, and she sighed and shook her head as if she lived with the craziest fool ever born.  
  
  ""You'd better get out of those damp clothes,"" she told him at last, and her voice was under control again. ""I just thank God it's not your body down at the bottom of the lake, too. "" She stood up and helped him unbutton his soggy shirt. ""Do you know who it wasi""  
  
  ""Never saw him before. ""  
  
  ""Who would do such a thing to another human beingi""  
  
  ""That's for J. T. to find out. "" He peeled his shirt off, and Mom took it from him with two fingers as if the lake's water carried leprosy. ""I've got to go over to his office to help him write it up. I'll tell you, Rebecca, when I looked into that dead man's face my heart almost stopped. I've never seen anything like that before, and I hope to God I never see such a thing again, either.

I know what I promised, but it is because my daughter in on vacation. When does a mother have a minute of peace when their children are at home? She simply doesnt want me here on computer writing things because she wants to watch something with me or play dolls with me. She wants to have some good quality time with me!!!

But let's move on.... Here I have the third part of our spooky and power couple: Tyler and Wednesday.

First of all.... ONCE AGAIN... THESE ARE THEORIES. HEADCANONS. NOTHING IS CONFIRMED. It's all based on the show, isolated scenes and some interviews. Let's have some fun just theorising things. We need to take a break and speak our hearts up.

**1- Wednesday and Tyler love each other. PERIOD.**

yeah, I know it's bold to assume that but I will take the risk. I really think they love each other. HOWEVER THERE IS A LOT GOING ON. Love is supposed to be easier, but it doesn't mean it is not real.

I'm not gonna state the facts on this post because you all have a bunch of good theories here that analyses and explains how Weylers scenes were real and meaningful, but I will be quick:

*Since their first meeting, she was compelled by him. She had other options than asking him the many favors she did, but she couldn't help to be near him and that's a lot. For me, she showed how she trusted him since the beginning and that's why the betrayal knocked her out. She has grown fond of him in a way she didn't expect because for the first time, she found someone to get along with her personality and to do not feel offended or disgusted. She was being herself and someone was interested despite all of her antics. lol People forget she is teenage!!! She was attracted to a boy, but she was afraid of losing hersef in the middle of the process. In the kiss scene, she was so afraid of being rejected but she didn't want to miss the opportunity anyways. She was finally ready to DEMONSTRATE her feelings, to trust him enough to be vulnerable, to be loved and love in return but... THE WRITERS HAD NO EMOTIONS!*

About Tyler, I have no doubts he loved her. There's no way he wasn't in love with her. He might not have been in love with her since the beginning, but he fell hard. HOWEVER people don't understand that Tyler is supposed to be an ambiguous character. HE IS MEANT TO BE THIS WAY! Why do you guys think do we still have doubts about his behaviour and lines even thought we stan him? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW MEANT SINCE THE BEGINNING! The show gave us hints, lines, body expressions, facial expression, HALF-TOLD STORIES because they WANTED to transform Tyler in an enigma for season 2. **Our job - as viewers - is crack his code**!

A side note: I don't even want to mention about the Hyde here, but if I believe he also kinda fancied Wednesday? YES! But my only doubt is who influenced who here.

Everything I said so far will have its importance on next topics. I promise.

**2 - The first six minutes says evertyhing we need to know!**

The way she tried to master her abilities to hunt her favorite serial killer since 6 years old to beat him ?! She went after the Escalper of Kansas to find him and take him down to prove how good she still is and would never be caught by someone who she ADMIRED again? And spoiler alert: the fact her emotions still are her sore point here.

Wednesday idolized these figures (not because she approved of their actions, but because she was fascinated by their cunning, their patterns, their darkness). The Escalper represented the peak of that morbid curiosity. By going after him years later, she's not just chasing a criminal—she's confronting a piece of herself. That's why the killer caught her off guard: She looked up for that man since she was 6 years old. The same way she was impressed when she found out the Hyde was collecting trophies like a seasoned SERIAL KILLER. It shattered her sense of superiority. Tyler, someone she let in, turned out to be exactly the kind of person she once looked up to. That mistake cuts deep. And because emotions are her weak spot, she can’t simply process it rationally

For me, it seems like her Mastery is a coping mechanism. She trains harder. She sharpens her powers. She hunts the Escalper. She overcorrects. It’s no longer about justice—it's about never being vulnerable like that again. She's *proving to herself* that she's still in control, still smarter, still emotionally untouchable. But the truth is: She’s still runningn from her feelings, from her past, from that moment Tyler surprised her.

The Escalper catching her off guard isn’t just a plot twist, it’s thematic justice. It shows that:

* She’s still emotionally compromised by admiration;
* She hasn’t truly healed from the Tyler incident;
* Her emotions cloud her judgment exactly when it matters most.

It’s the same story in a different skin. She admired the killer, and it cost her. Again.

So YES, Wednesday going after the Escalper isn’t just about stopping a killer. It’s her *subconscious attempt* to rewrite the Tyler story with a different ending. But because she hasn’t resolved the core issue, her emotional vulnerability and tendency to admire darkness, she gets caught off guard again.

And that’s what makes the storytelling so rich: Her greatest strength (intellect) and her greatest weakness (emotional detachment) are constantly at war.

**3 - Their reunion**

I don't think Wednesday is going after him because of a missing person or a piece of information he might know something about the case BECAUSE:

**Wednesday can simply touch the dead body or the object that she might trigger a vision.**

I THINK, AND NOW THE FUN STARTS, their reunion has a more meaningful reason behind it. Here I have some theories:

**a) Donovan dies.**

Unfortunately this theory has been spread and I think it makes some sense. In the teaser, we had a car crash and in the bts, we have Donavan leaving Nevemore when he meets Wednesday for the first time. You can notice she looks tense and Donavan looks defeated. I have a feeling that Donovan will ask Wednesday to visit Tyler but she will refuse it and here it all begins.

and YES, I've heard people saying that it's a different car even its number is another, but I see no reason why they would bring a similar red car to Tyler's in order to say it's not his. But anyway...

https://preview.redd.it/5j4e65wr6aaf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62b443b250a36a706653cc142130728ad426c80

Maybe Donovan is investigating about Laurel Gates and he finds out about Morning Song and he is attacked as a classical example of witness elimination. But he might not die and just be in coma. I don't know. In any case, he will be severely harmed. And then Wednesday will continue his investigation. That's when she goes to his house to see what point he stopped his investigation.

https://preview.redd.it/bgd63lxu6aaf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4507ad5336aba87ba4b2e8ea2497f59a71e46be

AND OF COURSE SHE WILL BE IN TYLER'S BEDROOM! Omg... This is gonna be insane.

https://preview.redd.it/yavibx0x6aaf1.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5694e26ec3284547c82acdd098719a31f1f6e9a

She is really tense here. She is nervous. I believe after visiting Tyler's house, she will go after Tyler. THE POSSIBILITY OF A VISIT IS NOT IN HER BOOKS AT ALL, BUT….here we woe! The possible fact Donovan ASKED her to visit Tyler before the tragedy would be appealing to Wednesday. She may go to talk to Tyler about his father, his investigation and something related to his Hyde and the possibility of Laurel Gates's boss be the one in charge of his father's attack and to transform him (Tyler) in a subject at Wilow Hill and a pawn in someone bigger's game. And of course, bringing the sad news about his father. IT IS A LOT! I wonder that maybe that's why he is mad mad in this frame:

https://preview.redd.it/7t173gyy6aaf1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a46805fdc390ff3f0bf2ec4d2211f972da6842

I like to think delusionally that he might be angry with her because she never visited him before and he might feel abandoned by her. But now she wants to ask his help like nothing's ever happenned! lol

Because she seems too introverted to someone who goes to visit an ex and talk about murders. I don't think that's the real reason. She is nervous at seeing him again and also she seems to hold back at his taunts. She seems a bearer of bad news.  Her face looks so sad.

https://preview.redd.it/xxjr9yx07aaf1.png?width=272&format=png&auto=webp&s=d152041fcdbd55c8376bb3d08d9f18b144c9749c

At the same she is analysing all of his reactions. We can see by the glass she comes closer when he is mad. And my headcanon about one of the reason Tyler/the Hyde is mad, crazy and unhinged is because he is distant emotionally and physically from her. I know it's not canon Hydes go insane without a master. But we assumed they do because Olga and Francoise were masterless (I guess) and they went insane. BUT IT WAS NEVER SAID THAT. However according to the last promo about Hydes where Hunter says they don't act alone since they have MASTERS. I don't believe Hydes need to have a master, they can go masterless whenever their Jekyll knows how to handle them. BUT HOW IS TYLER SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT? There's no Hyde alive around and Faulkner didn't finish his journal. and more importantly, HE WAS NEVER TAUGHT ABOUT HIS HYDE.

My explanation is plain and simple: Tyler is unstable because he cannot control his Hyde. He might not know much about his inner beast. No ones knows much about the Hydes to be honest but I don't believe Hydes are evil AT ALL. It doesnt make any sense.

So, yes, Wednesday will rescue Tyler in order to save him from an iminent danger . BUT there could be another reason: her Black Tears. Check it out:

https://preview.redd.it/kt3z1qb28aaf1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a18c406c933d557492d85ac8532e8d28bf4d48d

There's a message crypted. and letter S is stressed!!! Can you see that? Who is the letter S?

https://preview.redd.it/ka6sc5a38aaf1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91e92c625b4cc70b9c150b8b907477839b463a9

I think I cracked the code and the message says **Escape was her only option**. THE PLOT THICKENS...

The S is stressed, the letter S now is Tyler and the message! They are trying to show us something here!

My suggestion is Wednesday is traped. Physically, mentally and metaphorically.  Her only way forward in Season 2 might involve breaking out and we know who she will help to break out.

Tyler may now be key to Wednesday’s SURVIVAL, maybe the only one who understands or can help her. Or worse: he could be the trap. Maybe Wednesday must choose to trust him, or use him to survive.

Season 2 will force Wednesday into a situation where she’s outmatched, outnumbered, or restrained . Her only escape might require the help of Tyler, the Hyde, someone she shouldn’t trust, but might have to. The “S” might represent that survival requires sacrifice, strangeness, or even surrendering control.

And I'll be back to their possible connection soon!

**4) Tyler and his failed attempt to escape on episode  1**

On the BTS released in September, there was this frame:

https://preview.redd.it/e8s7xmf67aaf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9113a2e2dc1753a6d65cdbb7044ef9601333a

Tim Burton is in there. According to IMDB, he directed episodes 1, 4, 7 and 8.

https://preview.redd.it/z2194r6a8aaf1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=365a29b00d021b828220ef75d84f64caf47a0f0d

The red light: DANGER!

https://preview.redd.it/vn588ss97aaf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e17e6aa060abfd2420ac71b08cdcd62a5db8a43

he is definitely shooting at WH. You can see by the walls and because of the building. 

So I guessed Tyler will attempt to escape from WIllow Hill in the first episode. The first? YES! All of those pictures from the BTS are from episode 1. You can see the Hyde stunt performer is there on the left side  of the first picture. So I assumed Tyler will be caught and that's why he is on chains when Wednesday is visiting him. He is being punished! He transformed and must have hurt (or killed) people.

**5) the Hyde and the Raven are connected**

I know, you know, viewers know, even Wenclairs know: THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM! There is something we didn't understand yet, but there is. Since that first teaser of 5 seconds of them, they wanted to show how they are STILL connected.

But I doubt they will make their connection romantic. They are making it more meaningful. The romance is just a bonus!!!

Wednesday was responsible to trigger the EXTREME EMOTIONS  on the Hyde since the first episode and he could do things **by himself**, without Laurel's orders, for the first time:

**1- Rowan:** Tyler was not ordered by Laurel. She wasn't dumb to kill a rich kid from the outcast school that's why she only ordered Tyler to kill tourists. Tyler really meant to help Wednesday, but when she attacked by Rowan, Tyler must have feared by her life and it was his first transformation triggered by Wednesday: **the FEAR oflosing her or the NEED to saving her?**

**2- Fabian (The homeless guy)**:  Ok, this one I need to get back some minutes before in the episode when Tyler could have transformed in the old Pilgrim house because when she saw Wednesday on the floor having a vision and I assumed she spent some minute laid there. Tyler must have been frightened about her condition. BUT LOL I think he was transformed because Fabian had a bad attitude towards Wednesday and at the point, Tyler must have been felt a little protective over Wednesday. Let's not forget he could have used anyone to have the body part Laurel asked him, but now, he chose Fabian. What a coincidence huh? Extreme emotions activated: **Anger and overprotectiveness?**

**3- Eugene:** He misguided Laurel's order to do not kill Eugene because he knew Eugene was Wednesday's friend and yes, she would never forgive him if he had killed the bee boy. He must have fought for the control badly. He prefered to face the consequences with his master than losing Wednesday's admiration or love. Extreme emotions activated: **FEAR and FULL CONTROL**;

**4 - Kinbott:** GUYS, I'm sure Tyler decided to kill Kinbott because she threatened Wednesday. He was simply eavesdropping their conversation and Kinbott threatened to sent her to an asylum! He must have been pissed with her because the therapist who was supposed to help (they were having a session) was about to send Wednesday away from him! and Kinbott meant it! Extreme emotions activated: **ANGER AND PROTECTIVENESS.**

FOR ME, it was clear that **the Hyde was loyal to WEDNESDAY** and not to Laurel! WHY? Even when he was supposed to kill her, he was hesitating so much. and he was in his Hyde mode! It was not Hyde's m.o. at all!  Hyde was precise and fast at killing people. If he wanted to kill Wednesday, he would.

I think there's something that connects a Raven and a Hyde, like a supernatural one. Maybe a family secret???????

**6)** Bold assumptions:

* She will visit Tyler more than once;
* IF she is his master, she will avoid order him BUT it would explain why he doesnt attack her on his monster mode;
* But if she is not his master, she will only TRUST he won't kill her and IT'S WILD! Maybe her visions falters ???
* Because I don't think Wednesday would like to have a slave. She is very aware of Tyler/Hyde's condition and she would never take advantage on him;
* But somewhow I think she might become his master eventually. I think it has to do with the coffee machine metaphor (Wednesday fixes Tyler - help him to control his Hyde);
* She is gonna hide him at their parents' new house. BECAUSE of course Wednesday will be the person of interest when Tyler escapes. Their parents' house will be the last place, the police officers will go;

https://preview.redd.it/0y205l5k7aaf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=8765a368517d799c4f5fa34c6ae8ffbc3ef23bbb

* Bianca must siren song Tyler in order to avoid his transformations for a while. Wednesday will never put her parents in risk;
* Morticia may not like Wednesday's decision. I'm a mother and if my daughter would put her on risk this way, I'd be pissed too. But I know Morticia might be break a little when she sees Tyler which will remind her of his mother;

https://preview.redd.it/lxibdsxl7aaf1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c31d0a167eb9657ea6389295628b50f1dd40b49

* I think I will love Pugsley's arc! He reminds of my brother too! lol He is like a baby for me!;
* With that said, I guess Wednesday, Tyler and Pugsley might work together at some point. I bet Pugsley will like Tyler because he is a Hyde.

Well, I think I covered the main points of my theories here and If I have more to say, I'll come back! Just waiting for the trailer now... August is finally on its way!!!! Way to go, Cockroaches!!",6,1751383954.0,weyler,11,0.87,False
1lp4qrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1lp4qrh/dogfriendly_and_work_friendly/,Dog-friendly and work friendly?,"I was laid off a little over month ago due to my position being eliminated. I have ADHD and I'm medicated but have been finding it extremely difficult to be motivated to work on job applications, my portfolio, or anything along those lines. I'm definitely avoiding it because I've lost both of my jobs two years post grad and have been feeling really dismayed at the future of the field I'm in.

Anyway, I know I need to get out of my apartment and figure out a routine for myself. I know that if someone else is around or I'm even talking to them on the phone, I will do at least some work, but all of my friends have slowly been returning to office (🙄). 

The problem is, my roommate and I have an 8-month-old dachshund. He's a very good boy and will sleep when I'm working at home, but I'll try to play fetch and tug of war with him when he wants to. I'll give him snuffle puzzles and dig boxes too, but that doesn't fill his desire to be outdoors AND doesn't help me with productivity. But it's way too hot to bring him to a coffee shop to work (plus he's still working on learning how to settle and not eat everything on the ground). 

We've brought him to Skiptown before and unfortunately, he was one of the only small dogs there and was practically piled on by the larger dogs whose owners couldn't or didn't care to control them beyond a feeble attempt at a recall. I've brought him to Bloom & Bottle and it's dog-friendly but I'm not sure they're WFH friendly (if anyone knows that they are, please lmk). We live around Plaza.

I would leave him at home too but I know that I would be thinking about how I would need to leave in four hours and feel super anxious and rushed the whole time. If anyone else has ADHD, I hope you can relate and I'm making sense.

I know it sounds like I'm talking myself out of everything but I really do feel a little helpless right now even though I know I'm not. Does anyone have any other suggestions? It doesn't need to be a place for me to bring him with me, it could be a doggy daycare or any other creative solution you've tried before. tyia <3

1lp4qac,https://www.reddit.com/r/goatravel/comments/1lp4qac/annual_goa_trip_observations_tips_reviews_jun25/,"Annual Goa Trip Observations, Tips & Reviews (Jun’25)","I love Goa & I try to come here as much as I can & with different groups, solo or family.
This time around, I came with my family & as always, my love for the place increased.
Here are my 2 cents on a variety of things:

1. I’m all okay for  no Uber/Ola, Goa is not the first place in the whole world to not allow them. Even in Dubai, Europe & many other countries, they have their own app for the cab booking & works very well. Just that, Goa Miles App & Network needs some major breakthrough & improvements. Instead of reinstating ola/uber, I think the Govt. should work on this issue first.

2. Had a pretty smooth booking experience of a Fortuner Legender with Go Goa Car Rentals. The car was great & even though it has a slight scratch on the right mirror, they didn’t cut any deposit, so Yeah - I recommend it for Self-drive.

3. Casinos are fun. If you plan to visit one, I’d suggest check their website for any offers, if you find one, then great. If not, just go outside the casino & you’ll find a lot of dealers waiting outside luring you into one of the casinos. You can ask them & score a good deal even there. We got a sweet 10% discount for Deltin Royale & extra 1500₹ playing tokens for Strike Casino. 
P.S. The food at the ship casinos is pathetic, Hyatt has amazing food with a great casual casino. So I’d recommend Hyatt Casino (Strike Casino by Big Daddy)

4. Frustrations of local (taxi) drivers:
I had a couple of situations where I experienced frustrated drivers for no apparent reason. On a narrow internal road, I was driving & this local driver came into the same lane when clearly there was no room for two cars to pass each other & came in the middle & sat there & then I had to reverse my car but he didn’t budge/reverse. 
Another one, got into an argument with my Dad about the parking area of Arambol beach where I parked by mistake in the cabs area (which was not clearly written) So this guy in a cab, fully frustrated came in & started shouting that it was cab’s parking etc. & my Dad just normally said that it was not written anywhere & hence we parked there & then there was a heated argument between them.
Another one, I was driving a bit slow & was looking at the roadside store to see if I can find something interesting/to eat & this guy on a scooter behind me, went ahead & started abusing about driving too slow. 
So, all of this, made me feel like maybe the locals are indeed frustrated from tourists (?) Idk, just a feeling that I got.

5. Highly recommended restaurants: Tamil Table for South Indian style food (which is very tasty), Vinayak for Authentic Goan style food (Try their Chonak Fish), Spice Traders at W (Amazing Asian) & Maverick & Farmer’s Cafe (for an amazing cafe vibe & their coffee)

6. Now, I guess this one’s going to be a controversial part but I did notice that this time around, there were not many tourists (specifically the foreign crowd)
I’m not saying that I want them to be there but every other time that I’ve been there, Goa is flooded with tourists from every corner of the world & the vibe in the entire state is lively, fun & amazing. 
But this time, it felt a lot different. Maybe, due to so many issues, the tourists have indeed abandoned Goa for other countries like Vietnam, Thailand or Bali & if this is indeed true, there’s only 1 agency to blame, not the tourists, or the locals - Only the Government! It is primarily the responsibility of the government to make sure that for such a hotshot location which attracts so many foreign & local tourists, every kind of facility should be there. The infrastructure should be there. Roads, internal roads, beaches, their maintenance, facilities like showers, bathrooms, etc. should be there. 
If locals are a bit insecured about outsiders stealing their share of income, then it is indeed the Government’s responsibility to make sure nothing like that happens. 

I love Goa & Goans too. I have a lot of friends there as well & would not want anything bad to happen to the natural beauty & the vibe of the place. Tourism is a major economic contributor to Goa & it is the duty of the govt. To make sure that everyone is taken care of - the locals, the tourists, the businesses.

1lp4p4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1lp4p4x/i_suddenly_had_to_say_goodbye_to_my_last/,i suddenly had to say goodbye to my last childhood dog yesterday,"Daisy was a beautiful bouncy mischievous little lhasa apso-poodle mix. you would have never known she was 15 years old. other than a heart murmur graded 2/6 and a history of very short 3 seizures that each occurred 6 months apart, she was in relatively good health. she did have some bad teeth, so we ran labs and did a check up and decided she would be a good candidate for a dental procedure. she had the procedure last thursday and did great under anesthesia and had 2 teeth removed. when i brought her home she was sleepy, but perked up a few hours later and was drinking water but didnt have an appetite. the next morning she still didnt have an appetite, but she was due for a dose of meloxicam. the instructions said she should take it with food. i called her vet and her regular vet was on vacation, but the on call vet said to give her the medication anyways because maybe she wasnt eating because she was in pain. so i followed her instructions. the vet just warned that she may have some gi upset. she still didnt want to eat throughout the day and still seemed a little spacey but i figured the anesthesia was still wearing off. 

around 2am saturday morning, she started having diarrhea. and then it became more frequent. maybe around 6am i noticed that she had a few spots of bright blood in her stool, but that is something she has had in the past and when i spoke to her doctors about it previously they that was usually due to irritation near the anus, so thats what i figured was happening. then it suddenly got so much worse in the morning. like a lot of clear liquid tinged with blood. 2 times during the night she was begging to get on the bed with me and i would hold and comfort her, but then she would suddenly just walk off the bed. shes a rambunctious pup and always jumping off things etc., but when she fell it seemed to have bruised her back. i feel like a horrible person about that. i wasnt able to get her into an emergency vet until 10 due to wait times and some vets just not picking up their phones. so 8 hrs after symptoms started. 

this first emergency vet then rated her murmur at a 5/6 and said she was very dehydrated and said she had something i had never heard of before - hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. but after like 6 hours of fluids they graded the murmur at 3/6, got her hopped up on opioids, and said she was good to go home but just make sure she eats and drinks. they didnt have an overnight vet that day. on the way out a vet tech stopped me and told me that she was seriously concerned about daisy and that these patients are usually kept for 3 days, so to please call if anything changes. 

i brought her home and within 15 minutes we were back in the car heading to a different emergency vet. she was crying with every breath she took and hyperventilating. when the new vet was done triaging her, they said she was extremely dehydrated and the murmur was up to a 4 again. they told me they actually used naloxone on her because of the opiods. she spent saturday night at this vet. 

i visited her on sunday and she seemed better, with no more blood in the stool and the stool was more formed. she hung out in my lap and took a nap, she greatly needed some rest. she did soil herself twice, and this time the poop was greenish. the vet said lets do one more night oj fluids and antibiotics in the clinic and hopefully she could come home on monday. 

on monday around 9:45 i got a call from the vet that things took a turn for the worse and she had more internal bleeding. it was time. i couldn’t believe it. i picked up my fiance and we rushed over to see her. we layed down a blanket outside under some beautiful pine trees for her, and stayed with her for about 30 min. i didnt want to prolong her discomfort and had to make the call. she was asleep when it happened and she passed so peacefully. my baby girl. 

im in shock and denial. this same little doggy that was jumping up on my coffee table to steal my sliced cucumbers (her favorite) on wednesday is now gone. i never saw this coming. i thought after the dental procedure we were in the clear. 

i wish i never did the dental procedure. i wish that when i called the next day about the meloxicam, they would have told me when i should call an emergency vet and what hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is. i wish i would’ve taken her in the second i saw blood. i wish i would’ve slept on the floor with her so she wouldn’t have fallen off the bed. i wish i would’ve taken her to a vet that had overnight care, but i didnt know. i wish i wouldve taken her to the second vet we went to in the first place, they seemed much more competent. i only went to the first one because we’ve been there before and had great results. i wish we had more time. 

i feel like i was a good owner and i spoiled this dog rotten. daisy was my whole world. even my mother told me that i always put daisy’s needs before my own. and i wish i would’ve been thinking straight this weekend and have been a better owner. but i wasnt. i cant help but feel an immense amount of guilt. this was preventable. 

rest easy my sweet daisy bean - 5/5/2010-6/30/2025.

1lp4jgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lp4jgh/how_one_mans_grief_destroyed_a_town/,How One Man's Grief Destroyed a Town,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1751383495.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

He no longer just perched on them.
He read them. Or at least… stared at the pages like he understood far more than a bird should.

Kaelith first noticed it three days after Owlbert drank the Reader Sequence 9 Potion — a glimmering mixture traded for the cursed sea artifact, bitter-smelling and ink-thick. Owlbert had tilted his head once, dipped his beak, and drank without hesitation.

Since then He’d changed.



They were living out of the back of an old bell tower when they saw the notice nailed to the brick wall:

> HELP WANTED.
Café of the End seeks emotionally stable weirdos with flexible morals. Payment in coin, secrets, and coffee.
Ask for Kat.



Kaelith snorted. “Guess that’s us.”

Owlbert hooted in a low, approving tone.



The Café of the End sat between two buildings that shouldn’t have had space between them. Inside, everything smelled like old parchment and bitter roast. The walls were lined with books. Some breathed. Others glared when you passed by too quickly.

The man behind the bar looked maybe twenty. Or forty. Or never alive to begin with.

Kat wore a loose shirt, half-buttoned, with ink stains on his fingers and a smile too lazy to be fake. His eyes gleamed the way Kaelith had seen from true Seers — sharp, distracted, far away and inside you at once.

“You’re the gravedigger?” Kat asked.
Kaelith nodded.
“And this is… your owl?”
Kaelith hesitated. “He’s smarter than most customers.”
Owlbert fluffed his feathers and stared at Kat with unnerving stillness.

Kat blinked, then chuckled. “He reads, doesn’t he?”

Kaelith’s jaw tightened. “You see it too.”

“I feel it,” Kat said, tapping his temple. “He’s processing.”



The days passed strangely.

Kaelith cleaned tables and did minor corpse retrievals for odd clientele.

Owlbert perched by the café’s arcane menu, occasionally flipping the chalkboard with his beak and rewriting drinks in languages no one admitted to knowing. Once, Kaelith watched him trace an ancient runic circle into spilled coffee foam.

Even Kat didn’t interfere. He just watched. Waited.



It happened on the sixth day.

Kaelith was grinding ghostroot beans behind the counter when Owlbert let out a soft, vibrating chirp — one that felt like a string snapping in the air.

He’d been staring at a guest’s book — not just skimming, but reciting it in a whispery trill.

Suddenly, he froze.

Feathers bristled. Wings lifted slightly. His head twitched — once, twice — and then his entire form stilled like glass.

Kaelith dropped the grinder.

Kat leaned in from the other room. “He’s digesting it.”

Kaelith ran over, crouched beside Owlbert, reaching a hand out — and stopped when he saw it.

Behind those eyes… something had cracked open. A vast library. Dark and shifting and endless. And Owlbert stood in the center, not scared — learning.

He wasn’t just a pet anymore.

He was becoming a Reader.



That night, Owlbert wrote three words in the fogged café window.

Not scratched. Not pecked.

Written. With his claw.

> ""I remember everything.""



Kaelith stared, breath held.

Then slowly, he smiled — something he hadn’t done in weeks.

“Alright, professor,” he said. “Let’s find you a sequel.”

Meanwhile Huckleberry is still doing 12 oz bags, their quality is better, you also get a free coffee or americano with a bag purchase in store, the locations have amazing food and a comfortable space, and they have a drive through (at least here in wheatridge) if you're on the go.

The feather hadn’t moved.

It still leaned against the inside of the door like a quiet decision, its black surface catching no light, the burn mark at the tip clean and precise—unnatural. Jasmine stared at it longer than she meant to, until Bran gave a low, soft huff behind her. Not a warning. Not a comfort. Just acknowledgment.

She picked it up.

The red line along the spine hadn’t dried. That was the first wrong thing. Blood didn’t stay wet like that—unless it wasn’t quite blood. Not human. Not now.

She turned it between her fingers. No scent. No residue.

And then her finger opened.

No break. No sting. Just a slow, narrow bead along the pad of her left index finger. A familiar place. The skin there was already thinner. Used. The cut looked like nothing—less than a papercut—but it pulsed with something old.

She didn’t say anything. Didn’t curse or flinch. She just set the feather down on the entry table and reached under the sink for the same cloth she always used. Clean. Folded. Tucked behind a jar of coconut oil and unopened dog chews.

She wrapped it tight, fingers trembling only slightly.

Outside, the morning hadn’t yet settled into shape. Fog crawled across the yard like a spill, milky and deliberate. The mailbox flag was down. She hadn’t expected anything, but the red streak on the feather’s spine tugged her eyes toward the door’s mail slot again.

She opened it slowly.

Nothing on the floor.

But something caught—taped—to the metal lip inside. High and to the right. She had to use the wooden cooking spoon from the umbrella bin to knock it loose. It dropped with a soft slap.

An envelope.

No stamp. No writing. Just thick, weathered cardstock—government-issue heavy. She turned it over. Sealed, but not with glue. Pressed closed like it had never been opened.

She slipped a nail under the flap and peeled it back.

Empty.

Except for the symbol.

Embossed directly into the paper’s interior: a three-part seal. Triangle. Eye. Tree with severed roots.

She didn’t remember it. Not exactly.

But her stomach did.

Her hand curled into a fist. She pressed it against her chest, the cloth between her fingers already darkening.

She didn’t need to ask if this was real.

She’d seen that seal once before.

On a folder. Under fluorescent lights. In a place no child should have ever been sent to forget.

⸻

Chelle knocked like she always did—twice fast, once slow, like a heartbeat that couldn’t decide if it was scared or bored. She let herself in before Jasmine could answer.

Jasmine was still at the sink, rinsing blood off the cloth in cold water, the faucet a whisper she didn’t trust.

“You bled again?” Chelle asked, not looking up from the Pellegrino she’d pulled from her tote. “Jesus, Jazz. You gotta stop keeping your nerves in your fingertips.”

“It wasn’t intentional,” Jasmine said.

“Still looks like it hurt on purpose.”

Jasmine didn’t respond. She wrung the cloth out and watched the last threads of red curl down the drain like something escaping.

“Coffee’s hot,” she said instead.

“You trying to seduce me?” Chelle teased. “It’s working. But I’ll need toast too.”

Jasmine reached for the cabinet. “There was something else.”

“More than phantom feathers?”

She handed Chelle the envelope.

Chelle turned it over with one eyebrow arched. “This looks like bad mail.”

“It was taped inside the slot.”

Chelle opened it and squinted at the seal. Her face changed.

“You’ve seen this before,” Jasmine said quietly.

“Not me. My cousin. The one who went into social work. She used to call this the ‘don’t ask’ stamp. Said she found it once on a sealed file. Group home case that didn’t exist in the state system.”

Jasmine’s spine tingled. “She told you that?”

“Only once. She was drunk. Said it was one of those cases where all the records were ‘closed from above.’ Said the girl’s file had redacted lines like some kind of CIA drop. Said there was no intake form. No foster report. Just a birth date, a photo, and this seal.”

Chelle looked up. “What the hell, Jazz.”

Jasmine didn’t answer right away. She reached for her bandaged finger, pressing it against her palm like a secret she could still control. But the pressure flicked something loose.

The memory wasn’t linear. It never was. Just flashes.

Bunks. Close together. Not quite touching but no space to move. Too many in one room—dozens. Metal frames. No ladders. If you wanted top, you climbed like a thief.

And eyes. God, the eyes.

The overhead lights were always out after dinner. No nightlight. Just silence and the shimmer of wide, watching eyes in every direction. Some crying. Some dead dry. Some never blinking.

No age limit. Toddlers to teens. All in one room like it was cheaper that way.

She remembered the smell—bleach, old mattresses, piss. And a hand that used to tug her ankle in the night. Same pressure every time. Never loud. Never explained.

“You think it was me,” she said.

“I think they kept more than one girl off the books.”

There was a long beat.

“I remember being in a room,” Jasmine murmured. “Concrete floor. No toys. Metal table. Two chairs. A woman in a green dress with no badge. She called me by a different name.”

“Do you remember what name?”

Jasmine closed her eyes.

“No,” she whispered. “But I remember not being allowed to say no to it.”

⸻

The park was quiet for a weekday. Overcast skies kept most of the strollers and yoga moms at home. Which was fine with Jasmine. She preferred when it was just her and the weirdos and the wind.

The trees whispered, but not like they were talking to each other—more like they were listening. Paying attention.

Her daughter was a little ways off, crouched near a log, whispering to a patch of grass like it might whisper back. Probably looking for bugs again. Or a snake. Maybe both.

The grass around her moved strangely—only there. Not wind exactly, more like a shiver beneath the surface. Jasmine watched as a squirrel approached—slow, cautious, curious. It stopped just a few feet away from her daughter, nose twitching.

No surprise there.

Animals and creatures of all kinds found peace with her daughter. Feral farm cats let her pet them like they were house-raised. She could catch snakes barehanded and hold them like bracelets. Jasmine had made it a household rule: Empty all pockets before entering the house. Too many surprises over the years—some living, some… not.

Once, she’d found a bird skull wrapped in tissue inside a jewelry box.

Her daughter had smiled wide and said, “For you.”

There was no creepiness in her voice. No dramatics. Just the calm certainty of someone offering a gift. Jasmine had thanked her. Had meant it. Then buried it in a box in the back of the closet where her daughter wouldn’t think to look.

She leaned back on the bench now, arms crossed tight over her chest. The slats were uneven and dug into her shoulder blades, but she didn’t adjust. She preferred the discomfort. At least it was honest.

Her jaw was locked, and her foot tapped the ground in a steady, anxious rhythm. Her phone was heavy in her pocket. She hadn’t checked it since that morning, and that alone told her everything she needed to know.

He was coming early. She could feel it.

The text would be there, all clipped politeness and sugar-coated control. Something like:

He’ll be here sooner than we thought. Just for the weekend. We’ll all play nice.

That was the tone they always used—we, like it wasn’t just Jasmine being told to sit down, smile, and hand over her kid.

She tapped her fingers against the bench, eyes on her daughter now trying to lure a beetle onto a stick like it was a pet. Completely unaware of the ticking clock.

Completely unaware of what people would do to something they didn’t understand—but desperately wanted to own.

Jasmine wanted—needed—to keep it that way.

She didn’t want her daughter to know about the undercurrents, the whispers, the sharp smiles and watching eyes. Not yet. All she needed to feel was that a lot of people loved her. Really, truly loved her.

And what little girl wouldn’t want that?

But Jasmine knew better. She knew what they did to girls like that.

Pretty girls. Smart girls. Soft girls with power tucked behind their teeth.

She’d lived it.

Bounced from house to house like a problem no one wanted to solve. Labeled “difficult” by people who never asked what she’d survived. She’d been placed with one family after another. Some were quiet cruel. Some were loudly so. But they all said the same thing when the state came calling:

“She doesn’t listen.”

“She’s manipulative.”

“She lies.”

She didn’t lie. Not really.

But truth was slippery when your body was still learning not to flinch at kindness.

The family who’d finally taken her in hadn’t been her first, or second, or even third.

And when they lost her—briefly—after someone found out what they were doing in that basement, she thought it was over. She thought she’d be safe.

She thought wrong.

They got her back.

The paperwork was already changed. New county. New names on the mailbox. Even the dog was different.

And when they picked her up that day from the office, the man had smiled at her and said,

“This time, we’ll make it stick.”

Jasmine knew now what he’d meant. She didn’t then. Not really. Not until it was too late.

A breeze moved through the park, light but sharp, like it had teeth. Jasmine squinted up at the trees, but nothing looked out of place.

Then she heard it.

Not words exactly—but her daughter. Humming. Low, sweet, a tune Jasmine didn’t recognize.

The squirrel had inched even closer now, so close it could’ve crawled into her daughter’s lap if she let it. Two others had joined—flanking her like tiny sentries.

Jasmine stood slowly.

She felt the hairs on her arms rise, and it wasn’t the wind.

A black bird landed on the railing near her bench, staring at her sideways like it knew something she didn’t. It didn’t fly off when she stepped forward. Just cocked its head. Watched.

Her daughter turned and smiled at her.

Like she knew Jasmine had just felt it too.

“They like it when you’re calm,” her daughter said softly, like she was repeating something she’d been told before.

Jasmine didn’t answer. She just sat back down.

The birds didn’t leave.

Her hands were cold now, despite the thick summer air. Her fingers curled in her lap, seeking warmth, pressure, something.

She pressed her thumb into the faint scar across her index finger. Old and flat, from a time she couldn’t talk about—not because she didn’t remember, but because it would sound too rational. Too useful.

The cuts had helped, once.

When the world tipped, they brought her back. Not for attention. Not for pain. For structure. Like tracing the edge of a map only she could see.

That part of her never fully left. It just went underground.

Like everything else.

She rubbed the scar until it pulsed, then stopped.

Let the cold stay.

⸻

Later, after the park, after lunch and cartoons and a few hours of pretending they were normal, Jasmine sat on the back steps while her daughter drew chalk spirals on the patio.

The sun had come out, but the light felt filtered, like it didn’t want to commit.

She found herself staring at her phone. Not to read the text she already knew was there—but to stare at the timestamp.

10:05 a.m.

Same minute the fog had started rolling into the park. Same moment the black bird landed. Same number she’d heard once before, in a dream she wasn’t supposed to remember.

It was the kind of coincidence that didn’t breathe like coincidence.

Her daughter looked up then, as if summoned.

“Do you remember when I was little?” she asked, like it had been decades.

“You still are,” Jasmine said.

“No. Little little. Like three.”

Jasmine felt her throat tighten. “Of course.”

Her daughter turned back to her chalk, drawing now with two hands, eyes narrowed.

“That school with the yellow wall and the naptime dragon,” she said.

Jasmine’s pulse slowed.

“Yeah,” she said. “I remember.”

The Montessori preschool. The one with the black-and-white rugs and the too-happy teachers. The one they left after a single semester.

Her daughter didn’t stop drawing. “That day I made the kids be quiet.”

Jasmine didn’t move.

“You told me to never do that again,” her daughter said, almost softly. “But I didn’t hurt anyone.”

“One of them had asthma,” Jasmine said, her voice sharp before she could catch it. “They couldn’t breathe.”

“But I told them to stop when the lady got scared.”

Jasmine stood too fast. Her body hadn’t meant to—her nerves moved without her.

She remembered that day in full now. Twenty kids, all holding their breath in total silence for thirty-two seconds. The teacher in tears. The director calling Jasmine at work, voice shaking, whispering, “She just looked at them and they stopped breathing.”

Jasmine had laughed. She remembered that too. Not because it was funny, but because laughter was cheaper than fear.

But now?

She didn’t laugh.

Her daughter looked up at her.

“There’s something else,” she said. “I drew someone for you.”

Jasmine’s hands curled into fists. “When?”

“Before lunch. She told me her name this time.”

Jasmine stepped forward slowly.

The drawing sat on the edge of the stairs, folded once. Her daughter didn’t reach for it. Just nodded.

Jasmine opened it.

A woman in a green dress. Sharp chin. No eyes.

Not blank—just gone.

“I saw her once,” Jasmine whispered, her voice breaking before she meant it to. “When I was little.”

“I know,” her daughter said.

Jasmine looked at her. “How do you know?”

“She’s one of the ones who wanted me before you did.”

Jasmine felt the breath leave her chest.

“Wanted you how?”

“To keep me. Like a secret. Like a box. Like a weapon.”

“And now?”

Her daughter smiled faintly. “Now I’m with you.”

A pause.

Jasmine bent slowly, pulled her daughter into her lap, and sat there on the steps, arms around the only thing that ever made her feel like something might still be worth keeping safe.

The birds still hadn’t left.

And neither had the fog.

I (25F) have been in a relationship for 6 years, a few of which have been long-distance. I just recently met my boyfriend (24M) in person again after 1.5 years of not seeing each other, and my gut was telling me something was off. There was no proof just a strong feeling that something wasn’t right.

That gut feeling led me to dig a little, and I found out that he had been active on three dating apps while we were still very much together. Not just installed he was actively having conversations with girls and even met one of them in person.

When I confronted him about it, he first denied everything and started lying but eventually admitted it and claimed that he did talk to girls and the one he met with was just platonically. He said they got coffee and just “talked as friends.” But the truth is, they spent 5–6 hours together, roaming around the city, and during that time I was completely ghosted by him no texts, no updates, nothing bcs to me he said he was out with friends and he even put up a bad fight with me bcs I called him. It didn’t feel like an innocent meet-up. And honestly, I don’t believe the “just friends” excuse, especially since they met through a dating app.

He’s now begging for forgiveness. He says he made a mistake, that it didn’t mean anything, and that he’s very, very sorry. And I’m just…numb. This was a relationship full of love and hope for a future together being married.

this is the first time he’s done anything like this. For all these years, he was loyal and I never had doubts. But now that I know he was doing this behind my back while I was missing him, trusting him, and waiting something inside me feels completely broken. The betrayal feels unreal and Im in disbelief. I gave him my whole life. and loved him very very much. my world feels crashing down on me. 
And im here to ask how to cope with everything. 

I’ve always believed that cheating should never be forgiven. It’s a line you don’t cross. But now that I’m here, I’m stuck in this weird place of disbelief. After six years, it’s hard to just flip a switch and walk away, even though I know I probably should.

Right now, I don’t even know what step to take next,If I block him, I’m scared I’ll get curious later and unblock him. If I deactivate my Instagram, I might just reactivate it to check what he’s doing.
If I leave things open, I’ll probably read his messages, and maybe even respond even though I don’t want to. 
Its been two days and he keeps asking for forgiveness.

no contact? I give it time?
How do you actually start letting go

Now, I have no problems with Carnival and in fact we had so much fun that we made it a new annual tradition to go on a cruise together every summer to bond a bit.  However, the problem is my parents are VERY different types of people from me in a very different part of their life, so the things they want in a cruise are very different from what I want and was looking into other cruise lines that can maybe offer a little more than Carnival.

For context, my parents are in their golden years. They have been married for nearly 40 years and they still act like newlyweds, they love to go to trivia nights, they love to go to the pool and splash around, my mom will drag my dad to clubs and even to children's shows and waterparks. Carnival is very good at offering that type of entertainment, there is always something going on and some kind of party for all ages to enjoy. In my case though, I'm a single male in my early 30s and I'm a lot more introverted. I prefer to sit down and have a drink at a bar and just mingle, or read a book with a cup of coffee while sitting out on deck. I can not stand dealing with kids (which Carnival is full of), it just gets too noisy and makes it difficult for me to unwind. And when I do go out to clubs or events, I want it to be with other (preferably single) adults, not families or kids. 

I heard NCL caters very much to single cruisers, and has events for solo travelers to mingle and network and socialize without having to worry about kids running around or people being disinterested because they are with their family. That sounds like heaven to me. But I'm worried that there won't be enough ""lively activities"" for my parents to enjoy. I don't wanna be selfish and just book a cruise only I can enjoy.   
  
So for those of you who have traveled on NCL (especially the Aqua) are there enough fun activities and entertainment options for a couple to enjoy? How does the ""party atmosphere"" and entertainment compare with Carnival? And will I be able to enjoy myself as a solo/single cruiser while trusting that my parents are also having a good time as a couple?",2,1751382990.0,NCL,6,1.0,False

By chance, I took a knife meant for the New York's wealthiest heir. As thanks, he not only gave me money and a villa, but also promised to marry me.  
  
But when I returned after six months in the hospital? My adopted sister Mallory had taken over my villa and was secretly planning to take my place as his bride.  
  
After I exposed her, Mallory secretly used my SSN to borrow a million dollars.  
  
While I was hiding from debt collectors, she put on a wedding dress and went to marry into the Valentine family in my place.  
  
And me? I was eventually forced to fall from a rooftop to my death by those loan sharks...  
  
Fortunately, I was reborn.  
  
Now that I'm back, I'm not only blocking my foster daughter from snagging my SSN for loans and shutting down her whole fake bride scheme.  
  
Plus, I've got a real nice 'SURPRISE' waiting for her!  
  
...  
  
After six months in the hospital, I returned to the villa that Rhys had given me, only to discover I no longer had a place in my own home.  
  
The second-floor bedroom with the best natural light had become Mallory's bedroom, filled with the plush toys she loved.  
  
Even my study had been transformed into Mallory's personal walk-in closet.  
  
When she noticed my darkening expression, Mallory approached me with a shy smile, taking my hand in hers.  
  
""Riley, the rooms were just sitting empty while you were in the hospital these past six months.""  
  
""I have so many things and needed the space. You don't mind, do you?""  
  
Looking at Mallory's seemingly innocent face, I recalled my previous life when I returned from the hospital and didn't have the heart to ask her to vacate my room. That was the beginning of a pattern of giving in, step by step, until I was finally driven to the edge.  
  
I coldly yanked my hand away from hers. ""Actually, I do mind. You knew perfectly well this was my room, and you should have cleared everything out before I came home.""  
  
I calmly sat down. ""It's not too late now though. I'll watch while you find someone to help you move your things. I want both rooms restored exactly as they were within two hours.""  
  
Mallory stared at me in shock.  
  
She clearly hadn't expected that I—always the accommodating, easy-going sister—would become so assertive after taking that knife wound.  
  
Her eyes grew misty, a calculated layer of tears forming.  
  
On cue, my parents rushed to comfort her, shooting disapproving looks my way.  
  
""Riley, honey, there are plenty of other rooms in this house,"" Mom said with a frown. ""You could take one of the first-floor bedrooms. Mallory is your sister—if she likes these rooms, why are you being so difficult about it?""  
  
I studied my parents—former struggling small-town factory workers who now dripped with luxury thanks to my sacrifice.  
  
Dad wore a Gucci suit worth thousands, while Mom's pearl earrings and Tiffany necklace cost more than they used to make in whole life.  
  
I couldn't help but laugh bitterly.  
  
""Mom, Dad—when you say things like that, do you even remember how we got this mansion in the first place?""  
  
""Or have I been in the hospital so long that you've convinced yourselves you earned all this?""  
  
Their expressions immediately soured.  
  
""Watch how you speak to us,"" Dad snapped. ""So you accidentally saved the Valentine heir—it was just dumb luck. You happened to be in the right place at the right time.""  
  
I stood up, smiling without warmth. ""Oh, so you do remember that this mansion and all your newfound luxury came at the cost of my nearly losing my life?""  
  
Six months ago, while photographing in the downtown, I happened upon Rhys Valentine being pursued by would-be assassins. I'd planned to call the police, but when Rhys spotted me, he ran in my direction.  
  
Seeing the knife-wielding attacker closing in behind him, I instinctively pushed Rhys aside. The blade meant for his heart plunged into my abdomen instead.  
  
As I lost consciousness, the police arrived.  
  
During my unconscious state, the police arrived just in time. I could sense Rhys frantically holding me, his breathing becoming erratic.  
  
He carried me into the ambulance, looking at me with a complex, guilt-ridden expression.  
  
Only when the doctor said I wasn't in any life-threatening danger—just seriously injured—did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.  
  
""Riley was brave and fearless. If she hadn't saved me, that knife would have pierced my heart.""  
  
Despite his family's objections, Rhys insisted on marrying me.  
  
To show his sincerity, he showered my family with gifts—villas, checks, luxury items—in an endless stream.  
  
During my six months in the hospital, my parents and adopted sister Mallory were too busy enjoying their newfound wealth and status to visit me even once.  
  
They took everything for granted, perhaps even wishing I had died so Rhys would spend his life feeling guilty and supporting them in comfort.  
  
But I came back—alive.  
  
Seeing my assertive demeanor, Mom's eyes flashed with disgust as she frowned.  
  
""It's just two rooms. You're going to marry the Valentine heir—how can you be so petty?""  
  
""Exactly. What's the big deal about giving those rooms to Mallory? During the six months you were in the hospital, she took care of us in your place. If you ask me, giving her the entire villa wouldn't be too much.""  
  
I responded with a cold smile, saying nothing as the tension built.  
  
Mallory bit her lip and stepped forward, pretending to be understanding:  
  
""It's all my fault, sister. Please don't argue with Mom and Dad. If you don't like it, I can have my things moved out...""  
  
As she spoke, tears welled up from her eyes.  
  
I just smiled. ""Fine. So have everything moved out now.""  
  
Mallory looked up at me and bit her lip hard, seemingly surprised that I would insist even after she had brought our parents into it.  
  
With obvious reluctance, she called the bodyguards and housekeepers to help move her belongings.  
  
Two hours later, as Mallory's last piece of clothing left my room, she stood in the doorway and turned to look at me, her eyes revealing a flash of hatred and jealousy.  
  
I met her gaze calmly, with a faint, ambiguous smile.  
  
""Remember this: I chose these two rooms, and even if I get married and move out someday, no one else can have them.""  
  
Mallory lowered her head to hide her emotions and responded in a muffled voice.  
  
""I understand, sister.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Watching Mallory's silhouette disappear through the doorway, I narrowed my eyes.  
  
Having lived two lifetimes, I knew perfectly well that Mallory was a snake in the grass.  
  
Years ago, I felt sorry for her when I saw her being beaten by her gambling-addicted stepfather, which is why I asked my parents to adopt her.  
  
At first, she was genuinely grateful to me, but as the gap between us widened, her feelings soured.  
  
She used her cunning against me and my parents, and to marry into wealth, she didn't hesitate to scheme and cause my death.  
  
But this time, I would make her face the consequences of her actions.  
  
My show of authority upon returning home was effective—Mallory didn't cause any trouble for the next few days.  
  
Until the night before Mom's birthday, when Mallory suddenly proposed during dinner that she needed to use my SSN to claim a birthday gift for our Mom.  
  
""Sister, I've already used up the birthday offers on my account, but yours are still available. So... May I borrow your SSN Card?""  
  
I laughed inwardly, remembering this exact day in my previous life...  
  
Mallory put on a sincere face, asking to borrow my SSN Card, promising to return it within half an hour.  
  
What I didn't know was that she'd used it to take out massive loans from multiple lending platforms, amassing debt in my name that led to loan sharks hunting me down. In that life, I'd died falling from a building while trying to escape them, leaving my parents with no choice but to let Mallory take my place as Rhys's bride.  
  
And now, she was trying the same trick again.  
  
Seeing my hesitation, Mallory tilted her phone screen toward me. ""Look, it's just this membership program. Register with your SSN and you can claim a free massage chair—Mom would love it.""  
  
I reached for her phone, but she instinctively pulled back, panic flashing across her face.  
  
""Tell you what,"" I said with a light laugh, ""just forward me the link, and I'll register myself. No need to lend you my card.""  
  
Hearing my refusal, Mallory's eyes immediately welled with tears.  
  
""I know you've never really liked me, Riley. You've always seen me as an outsider,"" she whispered dramatically. ""I just wanted to do something nice for Mom's birthday, to show my appreciation.""  
  
Seeing her act like a victim, my parents couldn't stand by silently and immediately frowned at me.  
  
""Riley Brooks!"" Mom snapped. ""Where's your sense of family duty? Look at Mallory—she's not even our biological daughter, yet she shows more filial piety than you ever have.""  
  
Dad nodded in agreement. ""That's right. You were in the hospital for months without pouring us a single cup of coffee, while Mallory has been taking care of our every need. What's the big deal about lending her your card?""  
  
""She's been raised alongside you like a real sister. Do you honestly think she'd do anything to harm you?""  
  
Facing my self-righteous parents, I maintained a calm exterior despite my emotional detachment.  
  
In my previous life, when those loan sharks drove me to my death, my parents hadn't shed a single tear. Their only concern was preserving their luxurious lifestyle, which led them to readily accept Mallory's suggestion that she take my place in the Valentine family.  
  
They hadn't even given me a proper funeral, just wrapped my body in a cheap sheet and buried me on the hillside behind our old house to hide the evidence.  
  
I smiled coldly, fixing my gaze on Mallory. ""What if someone with bad intentions used my SSN to take out loans in my name? What then?""  
  
Mallory's facade cracked at having her scheme exposed. Her face paled dramatically as she forced more tears.  
  
""Never mind, Riley. Forget I asked, I'll just work extra shifts at three different jobs to buy Mom a massage chair myself...""  
  
With that, she ran out crying, and Mom shot me a glare before hurrying after her.  
  
""Mallory, sweetie, don't cry. Mom has a plan,"" I heard her say in a hushed tone.  
  
She whispered something in Mallory's ear that made the girl stop crying immediately. ""Really?"" Mallory asked, wide-eyed with disbelief.  
  
Mom nodded confidently. ""Trust me. With my help, you'll get what you want. Let's see if Riley dares to mistreat you after this.""  
  
Watching this exchange through the security camera feed in my study, I couldn't help but laugh out.  
  
Mom, Mallory—I gave you both chances, but YOU chose to throw them away.  
  
That night, Mom unexpectedly knocked on my bedroom door, carrying a glass of juice.  
  
""Riley, how are your injuries healing?"" she asked with forced concern. ""Your father and I were so busy these past six months we couldn't visit you in the hospital. But I heard Rhys sent plenty of health supplements and brought in specialists for your surgery. You must be almost fully recovered by now, right?""  
  
I gave a noncommittal response before cutting to the chase. ""What do you really want, Mom?""  
  
She averted her eyes momentarily before smiling and offering me the glass. ""Nothing at all. I just wanted to check on you. This is freshly squeezed orange juice—good for your vitamin C. Drink up.""  
  
I studied her for a moment before accepting the glass and drinking it all.  
  
Seeing this, Mom left with a satisfied smile, bidding me goodnight.  
  
Later that night, I heard soft rustling sounds in my room.  
  
Right on schedule—Mallory had come to steal my SSN Card while I was supposedly drugged and unconscious.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
But in the darkness, my eyes remained wide open, fully alert.  
  
I'd already seen through the security cameras that the orange juice Mom brought was drugged.  
  
I'd been waiting in my room, gambling on whether she would actually go through with giving me a spiked drink for the sake of her adopted daughter.  
  
She did. And I drank it.  
  
But as soon as she left, I rushed to the bathroom and forced myself to throw up everything.  
  
Now, hearing the soft click of my bedroom door closing, I sat up and checked my drawer—my SS Card was gone, just as I'd expected.  
  
But I just settled back into bed and slept until late morning.  
  
When I finally went downstairs for breakfast, Martha, the housekeeper who ran the kitchen, gave me a sidelong glance.  
  
""Your breakfast, miss,"" she muttered, practically throwing a cold plate of eggs and toast in front of me before turning to leave.  
  
""Stop right there,"" I called out coldly. ""What exactly is this supposed to mean?""  
  
I knew that ever since I'd argued with my parents on my first day back, all the household staff had started looking down on me.  
  
They didn't realize I was actually the reason for this family's good fortune.  
  
During the past six months, they had come to see only my parents and Mallory as their true employers.  
  
Especially after I reclaimed my rooms, they assumed I had stolen Mallory's belongings and showed me even less respect—they didn't even properly prepare my meals.  
  
Not only was my food carelessly made, but it was already cold when served to me, with utensils just tossed onto the table.  
  
Martha rolled her eyes at my question. ""Eat it or don't. Your parents said not to spoil you.""  
  
I held her gaze steadily. ""Since you clearly don't want to do your job properly, you're fired. Go pack your things.""  
  
Without breaking eye contact, I called the house manager. ""We need two new kitchen staff. Make sure they're loyal and have PROPER attitudes.""  
  
When Martha realized I was serious about firing her, panic flooded her face. ""Miss Riley, if you don't like the food, just tell me! I'll make something else right away—please don't fire me!""  
  
She had assumed the power in this household belonged to my parents and Mallory. She thought they were the ones signing her paychecks.  
  
She had no idea I was the one truly in control.  
  
And I knew she'd been accepting bribes from Mallory specifically to make my life difficult.  
  
""I already gave you one chance.""  
  
I replied evenly, unmoved by her sudden change in demeanor.  
  
""You need to understand which money is acceptable to take and which isn't. More importantly, you shouldn't forget what your actual job is.""  
  
Martha nearly fell to her knees begging, causing a scene that drew the attention of other staff members.  
  
But her pleas made no difference—she left with her belongings in disgrace.  
  
This display sent a clear message to the rest of the household staff: disrespecting me would not be tolerated.  
  
Mallory witnessed the whole thing and seized the opportunity to play the compassionate one.  
  
""Riley, not everyone is as fortunate as you, you shouldn't be so harsh.""  
  
""Martha probably struggled to find this job in the first place.""  
  
I shot her a cold smile.  
  
""If you're so concerned, why don't you pay her salary yourself? Take her home and treat her like your own mother. I wouldn't mind at all.""  
  
I paused deliberately. ""Oops! I almost forgot—you're just a guest in my house, aren't you? An adopted daughter probably shouldn't be so generous with other people's resources.""  
  
Mallory bit her lip hard, her face turning ashen.  
  
Just then, a Bentley pulled up to the mansion. Rhys Valentine had come to visit.  
  
He stepped out of the car as his driver unloaded several gift boxes from the trunk and handed them to me.  
  
""I should have thrown you a homecoming party when you were discharged,"" he said with a warm smile. ""But you insisted against it.""  
  
I smiled back. ""There's no need to make such a fuss.""  
  
The fact that our family had gone from struggling to wealthy overnight because I saved the Valentine heir was already drawing enough resentment.  
  
Being more ostentatious would only invite more trouble.  
  
After lunch, Rhys and I took a walk through the garden.  
  
Suddenly, he smiled mysteriously and had his driver bring over an exquisite box—inside was a stunning ivory wedding gown with intricate beadwork that caught the sunlight in a breathtaking display.  
  
The driver explained with a smile: ""The Valentine family is one of the most prestigious in the city. They only use the finest things. This wedding dress was specially commissioned by Mr. Valentine from a famous designer and took half a year to complete.""  
  
""Three days from now, I can't wait to see you walking down the aisle in this,"" Rhys said softly.  
  
I nodded with a smile, catching sight of Mallory watching us from the terrace, her expression twisted with jealousy.  
  
""I can't wait either"", with that, I stood on tiptoe and placed a gentle kiss on his cheek.  
  
Surprise flickered across his face before transforming into a complex mix of emotions and finally settling on joy.  
  
On the wedding day, my parents were frantic, unable to find me anywhere.  
  
Mallory, however, seemed completely unsurprised as she glided down the stairs with a smug smile.  
  
""Mom, Dad, you can stop looking. Riley won't be attending her own wedding.""

My fiancé's childhood sweetheart twisted her ankle, and without hesitation, he became her personal chauffeur.  
  
When I expressed my dissatisfaction, he actually let his little childhood sweetheart move into the new home we had prepared for after our marriage.  
  
He even had the audacity to tell me: ""It's your fault for being petty and not letting me drive Autumn to and from work. Her foot injury hasn't healed, and I don't want her walking such a long distance.""  
  
""Our new place happens to be close to her company. We're not living there yet anyway, so it might as well be used.""  
  
Even on the very day we were supposed to get our marriage license, he stood me up completely.  
  
""Autumn sneezed twice this morning. I'm worried, so I'm taking her to the hospital. Getting the marriage certificate isn't urgent—we can reschedule for another day.""  
  
Huh, reschedule my ass!  
  
I immediately called my childhood friend:  
  
""Nate Sullivan, want to get married with me? If yes, get your butt over here right now!""  
  
...  
  
I waited at the intersection for half an hour with no sign of my fiancé's car.  
  
Usually by this time, he would have already parked and be waiting to drive me to work.  
  
For three years, rain or shine, he'd never missed a day.  
  
When my 20th call finally went through, a woman's voice answered.  
  
""Hey, Rayna, Logan can't talk right now—he's driving.""  
  
""I'm Autumn. I twisted my ankle this morning. Logan was worried and offered to drive me to work.""  
  
""Put him on the phone,"" I demanded.  
  
""Logan Harper! You couldn't bother to call and tell me you were picking up Autumn? Do you have any idea how worried I was?""  
  
""It was an emergency and I was in a rush—completely forgot about you. By the way, I won't be able to drive you to and from work anymore.""  
  
""Autumn hurt her ankle, so I need to drive her. That's all. Gotta go.""  
  
My blood was boiling.  
  
This Autumn was the ultimate queen of manipulation, and of course, men just ate it up.  
  
So, I had to take a taxi to work, making me two hours late.  
  
My boss—who also happens to be my childhood friend—called me into his office.  
  
""What happened today? You're seriously late.""  
  
""Don't even get me started. Logan ran off to pick up Autumn without telling me. I wasted time waiting for him, then went to his place looking for him. The whole thing was a wild goose chase.""  
  
""What a jerk! Just Dump him and marry me instead!""  
  
I rolled my eyes. ""Give me a break. I still remember you in diapers.""  
  
Just then, my phone pinged with a message from Autumn.  
  
\[Sorry, Rayna! Did you get in trouble with your boss for being late? I told Logan he didn't need to drive me, but he insisted. You don't mind, do you?\]  
  
I replied: \[Thanks for your concern, but I'm the boss's favorite—I'm the one who scolds him, not the other way around.\]  
  
\[And FYI, I'm three years younger than you, so I should be calling YOU 'sis.' Also, I absolutely DO mind Logan driving you every day, so take a taxi from now on.\]  
  
That felt so—good.  
  
Autumn quickly replied: \[Sorry, judging by your appearance, I thought you were older.\]  
  
\[I told Logan I'd take a taxi, but he wouldn't listen. Maybe you should talk to him yourself.\]  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I showed my phone to Nate. ""See this? She's saying I look old!""  
  
""Says the thirty-something who dresses in Lolita fashion trying to look young.""  
  
Then Autumn posted on Facebook: \[My personal chauffeur's passenger seat\~\]  
  
The photo showed her in the passenger seat of my car, head tilted to one side, with Logan's shoulder visible beside her.  
  
Fuming, I called Logan.  
  
""Finished escorting your precious Autumn? Meet me at the coffee shop below my office. We need to talk.""  
  
Half an hour later, I faced Logan across the table.  
  
""What's so important it couldn't be said over the phone?""  
  
""How long are you planning to chauffeur Autumn around?""  
  
""Sprains take time to heal—at least three months, I'd say.""  
  
""Fine. Then give me back my car. I'll drive myself to work.""  
  
The car Logan drove was actually mine.  
  
When he first saw my Mercedes, he was practically drooling, saying he'd never driven such a nice car and wanted to try it.  
  
Eventually, he just took over, appointing himself my personal driver, and I let him keep it.  
  
""What am I supposed to drive if I give it back?""  
  
""That car was a gift from my father so I could get to work easily. Now that you're not driving me anymore, I want it back. Any problem with that?""  
  
""Can't you just take a taxi? You know I need to drive Autumn to work. When did you become so petty, Rayna?""  
  
""Autumn's like a young sister to me. She's injured—shouldn't I help her?""  
  
""Last I checked, you're an only child. When did you suddenly get a sister, Logan?""  
  
""And why can't Autumn take a taxi? Besides, you're about to get married. Do you think it's appropriate to use your fiancée's car to chauffeur another woman around every day?""  
  
I didn't want to waste any more words. I simply held out my hand:  
  
""Keys. Now.""  
  
Logan scowled for a long moment before finally saying, ""Fine, I won't drive her anymore. I didn't think this through. Happy now?""  
  
""That's more like it.""  
  
As the workday was ending, Logan called.  
  
""Can't pick you up tonight. Helping a friend move.""  
  
""Whatever. Just don't be late tomorrow morning.""  
  
After hanging up, I noticed Nate leaning against my desk, watching me.  
  
""What?""  
  
""Want to bet your fiancé is making excuses to pick up his little damsel in distress?""  
  
""No way. When he makes a promise, he keeps it.""  
  
""You're that sure? What if he's taken her to his place to look after her?""  
  
""That's even more ridiculous! What kind of person do you think he is?""  
  
Despite my confident words, doubt crept in.  
  
So that night, I video-called Logan:  
  
""Are you alone?""  
  
""Of course. Who else would be here?""  
  
""Show me around your apartment. I want to see.""  
  
""What, you think I'm hiding someone?""  
  
Logan panned his phone around his rental apartment—No one else was there.  
  
I finally relaxed.  
  
Just as I was about to fall asleep, Autumn posted a late-night update that left me wide awake and staring at the ceiling.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Autumn posted a selfie with the caption: \[Moving into my new place.\]  
  
The wall art in her background was identical to the decorations in the new home Logan and I had prepared for after our wedding.  
  
A sinking feeling hit my stomach, but I quickly dismissed it.  
  
Logan wouldn't do something that outrageous...Right?  
  
The next morning when Logan picked me up, I casually asked, ""Who were you helping move yesterday?""  
  
""Just an old coworker. We were close at our last job, so when he asked for help, I went over.""  
  
""What a coincidence. Autumn was moving yesterday too. She didn't ask you to help?""  
  
""Really? No, she didn't. Probably hired movers.""  
  
His quick answers seemed genuine enough, so I let my suspicions fade.  
  
When the weekend rolled around, I bought some new decorations and asked Logan to come with me to our new place.  
  
He visibly panicked for a split second.  
  
""Uh... let's skip it. It's scorching hot today. Why don't we stay in and watch a movie instead?""  
  
""Forget movies. If you won't come, I'll go by myself.""  
  
Logan grabbed my arm quickly.  
  
""How about this—I'll take you to that fancy Japanese restaurant you've been wanting to try, then we'll catch a movie after. My treat!""  
  
This was completely out of character.  
  
Logan was notorious for being cheap. When we went out, we took turns paying, but his ""turns"" always meant street food or budget chain restaurants.  
  
Now he was suddenly offering to take me for expensive sushi?  
  
Hell must've frozen over!  
  
But I didn't call him out though. I went along with the Japanese dinner and movie—nearly costing him $500, which practically gave him a heart attack.  
  
On the drive home, he kept mumbling about how I should treat him next time.  
  
After he dropped me off at my apartment and drove away, I immediately caught a taxi to our new place.  
  
Yet the digital lock there wouldn't accept my password after several attempts.  
  
Thankfully, I had brought my key and used it to open the door.  
  
What I saw inside left me speechless—  
  
Our home—which I had meticulously decorated to my taste—was completely transformed.  
  
The elegant Scandinavian art in the living room had been replaced with Crayon Shin-chan posters. Our beautiful brown leather sofa was covered with an ugly, fuzzy slipcover.  
  
All our black and gold furniture had been painted white, and everything had been rearranged.  
  
When I opened the master bedroom door, there was Autumn, sleeping in what was supposed to be MY marriage bed, using MY bridal silk bedding set!  
  
I'd mentally prepared myself for the possibility that Autumn might be staying here, but I never imagined she would completely take over and redecorate our carefully planned home—and have the audacity to sleep in our marriage bed!  
  
She jolted awake, startled. ""Rayna! Don't you knock before barging in? Who gave you permission to enter my home?""  
  
I was so furious I could barely speak.  
  
""Get this straight—this is MY home!""  
  
""Logan said he's lending this place to me, so it's my home now. Didn't your mother teach you not to enter someone's house without permission?""

1lp487u,https://www.reddit.com/r/GardeningUK/comments/1lp487u/wasps_getting_me_down/,Wasps getting me down,"Before anyone comes for me, yes I know wasps are a good sign, good for the environment etc. 

I had to pay someone to treat a wasp's nest for me recently, it wasn't really money I had spare but the nest was in a spot I couldn't see or reach and it wasn't safe to get too close to see exactly where it was. 

The treatment was successful, I know this because in this particular spot there was constant heavy wasp activity going in and out and now there is none. However I still have quite a few in my garden all the time and the treatment was over a week ago. They're drinking from my pond, and I have a few carnivorous plants that need to sit in trays of water so they're drinking from them too. These plants need watering almost every day and every time I put water in the dish, three or four wasps come out of nowhere. I do have a larger carnivorous plant that has caught a few wasps. I know these types of plants attract wasps but I'm very proud of my collection and didn't have this issue last year or the year before.

There's also one or two wasps loitering around my compost bin. I can see them go under the lid to get in. I don't think there's a nest in there because it's only ever one or two wasps, nothing compared to when I knew I definitely had a nest. Either way I've stopped adding anything to that bin because last time I tried to pull the lid off, a wasp angrily buzzed around my hands and face. The bin is right next to the pond, and I'd bought some trellises to put where the bin is (I'm planning on moving the bin) but I can't empty and move the bin while it's a regular haunt for yellow jackets. 

My garden backs on to a woodland so maybe there's another nest nearby but I've no chance of getting that treated, definitely can't see it and it's not my land and is incredibly overgrown anyway. 

I love my garden, I WFH and used to sit up by my pond twice a day with a coffee and now I just don't feel brave enough to do so. My toddler also loves being outdoors, we recently bought a large paddling pool but the wasps are attracted to the water - they don't often fly in it but they land in the puddles from splashing onto the patio. 

Idk I'm sorry if this seems like such a silly thing to be down about, I know the advice is to remain still and calm but I've done that before and have still been stung; I actually have the most success from running away lol. And I worry about my toddler, she likes to go barefoot on the grass and often just completely naked in the garden in general and I just can't relax when she's playing and there's two wasps hovering around her ass. 

Idk feel free to snap me out of it and tell me I'm being a giant baby. I've put a lot of work in to the garden this year and I've noticed 100s of butterflies and ladybugs and one or two dragonflies, had a lizard at one point too and a couple of slow worms, I want my garden to be nature friendly and that does extend to all creatures but I just can't relax when I go out there for fear of sitting on a wasp or having one land in my hair.",2,1751382787.0,GardeningUK,5,1.0,False

1lp46gj,https://i.redd.it/ayd9sp68y9af1.png,Double appreciation post: device and game!,"**The Device**  
  
I own the Odin 2 Portal, Anbernic SP, and now the **Trimui Brick**. This was supposed to be like a gimmick device I could just take everywhere because even my SP feels a bit bulky in my pocket. I had done a lot of research and thought this would be perfect because of how small it was but I was pretty sure it would be uncomfortable to play for more than 5 minutes. I was wrong... this device has seen over 10 hours of gaming in the last week for two reasons:

* It's so light and portable that I just take it literally everywhere because I don't feel it in my pocket
* The UI, NextUI, is insane. The fact that I just press the power button and it goes to sleep then press it again and my game starts right up immediately right where I left off. This means that I could play as I wait for my coffee to be made since booting up is instant. This UI has a carousel of images of all the save states from each game you've played so swapping between games is super easy and fast. On the SP I have MuOS which is fine, but it takes a bit to boot up from sleep and switching games is nowhere near as fast... but either way it just feels so bulky so I tend not to take it out much. 

For some reason this device is super comfortable to hold but then again, the longest session I've had was 30 minutes so maybe longer and it won't be super comfortable. 

Something else that I love about it is the premium feel it has. It has a nice weight to it... doesn't feel like plastic, feels really nice.

**The Game**

I have a short attention span when it comes to retro gaming. I'll play Pokémon, Mario, and DK in super short bursts of a few minutes. Longer games like Mother and Zelda sometimes feel like a drag since I feel like I'm lost half the time. I wanted something that had a story, that was linear, but wasn't your standard RPG. I stumbled upon **Summon Night : Swordcraft Story** using ChatGPT... not even sure how it was able to find this as I believe this is a hidden gem because I've never seen it or heard anyone bring it up before. Even videos online don't really do it justice. 

It's a hub type game that mixes dungeons, crafting, side scroll fighting and the story has multiple things going on so it's never boring. It's a linear story but it feels like there is so much going on without being overwhelming. The game is relatively straight forward in the sense that in the 8 hours that I've played it, I've only needed to google something twice. The fact that I've played this for 8 hours is insane to me especially with my attention span, but that's really also thanks to the device. 

The game is not perfect though... the music is not the best, the graphics aren't the best, the dialogue can get cringey at times, the intro feels really grindy, and dungeon design is pretty bad.... but somehow everything else really makes up for it. It's one of the few games I've ever played where I'm excited to play the second one (which I know nothing about). 

**TLDR**

The **Trimui Smart Brick** surprised me. I expected a gimmick, but it’s become my most-used handheld with over 10 hours this week ...because it’s so pocketable, has an amazing UI (NextUI), and wakes instantly from sleep right into gameplay. It's light but feels premium, and even with short gaming sessions, it’s super comfortable.

On it, I discovered **Summon Night: Swordcraft Story**, a hidden GBA gem with a linear but engaging story, crafting, dungeon crawling, and side-scrolling combat. Despite some flaws (meh music, cringey dialogue, weak dungeon design), it's held my attention for 8+ hour which is SUPER rare for me, and I’m genuinely excited to play its sequel.

I (25F) have been in a relationship for 6 years, a few of which have been long-distance. I just recently met my boyfriend (24M) in person again after 1.5 years of not seeing each other, and my gut was telling me something was off. There was no proof just a strong feeling that something wasn’t right.

That gut feeling led me to dig a little, and I found out that he had been active on three dating apps while we were still very much together. Not just installed he was actively having conversations with girls and even met one of them in person.

When I confronted him about it, he first denied everything and started lying but eventually admitted it and claimed that he did talk to girls and the one he met with was just platonically. He said they got coffee and just “talked as friends.” But the truth is, they spent 5–6 hours together, roaming around the city, and during that time I was completely ghosted by him no texts, no updates, nothing bcs to me he said he was out with friends and he even put up a bad fight with me bcs I called him. It didn’t feel like an innocent meet-up. And honestly, I don’t believe the “just friends” excuse, especially since they met through a dating app.

He’s now begging for forgiveness. He says he made a mistake, that it didn’t mean anything, and that he’s very, very sorry. And I’m just…numb. This was a relationship full of love and hope for a future together being married.

this is the first time he’s done anything like this. For all these years, he was loyal and I never had doubts. But now that I know he was doing this behind my back while I was missing him, trusting him, and waiting something inside me feels completely broken. The betrayal feels unreal and Im in disbelief. I gave him my whole life. and loved him very very much. my world feels crashing down on me. 
And im here to ask how to cope with everything. 

I’ve always believed that cheating should never be forgiven. It’s a line you don’t cross. But now that I’m here, I’m stuck in this weird place of disbelief. After six years, it’s hard to just flip a switch and walk away, even though I know I probably should.

Right now, I don’t even know what step to take next,If I block him, I’m scared I’ll get curious later and unblock him. If I deactivate my Instagram, I might just reactivate it to check what he’s doing.
If I leave things open, I’ll probably read his messages, and maybe even respond even though I don’t want to. 
Its been two days and he keeps asking for forgiveness.

no contact? I give it time?

I understand that cars registered after 31 December 2020 are not VAT and customs exempt. Meaning you’d be liable for VRT, VAT, customs, possibly more. 

I also understand some UK dealerships are able to help you claim back the UK vat if you are exporting the car out of the UK? 

I am also aware that “ringing revenue” can sometimes help reduce your VRT quote. I think for an a3 it’s 4500.

Two little questions
1) Has anybody any experience in importing NI / UK cars. How can you minimise the tax and customs burden? 

2) side note… is there any glaring reliability issues with the 2020+ a3 petrols? I assume they’re fine if you maintain them as directed.

The sun was shining brightly in LEGO City as Michael Brickson, a 22-year-old LEGO man in a navy-blue suit, marched down Brick Avenue. His suitcase bounced slightly with each step, and his yellow plastic face wore the calm expression of a man who had done this routine a hundred times before. Click-clack. Click-clack. His square feet made perfect contact with the sidewalk studs. Today, like every day, he was heading to his job at the City Planning Office, where he managed road construction budgets and took his coffee with exactly two cream bricks.

""Morning, Michael!"" called out Pete, the pizza delivery guy, zooming past on his scooter with a hot brick-oven pie balanced on the back.

""Hey, Pete! Smells like you're saving the city one slice at a time,"" Michael replied with a grin.

""You know it! But if this weather keeps up, I'll need a boat instead of a scooter!""

High above, far beyond LEGO City, Connor, a 10-year-old boy, was playing on the carpet floor of his bedroom. He leaned in over the plastic world he’d built—complete with skyscrapers, vehicles, and the occasional chicken.

""And now... the LEGO police chase the bad guy through the streets!"" he said, zooming two minifigures across the layout. In his excitement, his arm brushed a glass of water on his desk. It tipped.

SPLASH.

Water cascaded down onto LEGO City, knocking over trees and flooding the main street.

Back in LEGO City, the citizens panicked.

""It’s the worst rainfall we’ve had since the Great Spill of ’04!"" yelled a firefighter minifigure as water pooled around the fire station.

""My pizza's floating away! Nooo!"" shouted Pete, trying to steer his scooter to higher ground.

Michael rolled up his sleeves. ""We need sandbag bricks and fast! This is turning into a city-sized swimming pool.""

Two days later, while Connor was playing again, a sudden sneeze overtook him. ""ACHOO!""

LEGO City trembled. Traffic lights wobbled. Street signs flew. Citizens ran for cover.

""IT’S A TORNADO!"" someone screamed as bricks flew through the air like debris.

Michael took cover behind a park bench. ""Why do I feel like the universe has allergies?!""

No one knew where these strange weather events were coming from. Scientists, construction workers, and even Pete the pizza guy were baffled.

Three days after the initial flood, Michael Brickson found himself called to the mayor’s office for an emergency briefing.

Mayor Brickwell, a stern minifigure with a monocle and top hat, paced nervously in front of the city model.

""Michael,"" the mayor said, ""our city has endured unnatural floods, mini-tornadoes, and floating taxis. This is not normal.""

""Sir, with all due respect, it feels like we’re inside a toy box during a thunderstorm.""

""That’s absurd! But... oddly accurate,"" the mayor muttered. ""Still, I need answers. Find out what’s behind this madness.""

Later that afternoon, as Michael jogged through City Hall Plaza, he stumbled over a discarded soda can.

""Ugh, who litters next to City Hall—WHOA!""

He went flying forward, arms flailing. Instead of smashing into the stone wall of the mayor’s building, he passed straight through it with a shimmering ripple. He landed face-first on the other side—but strangely, he wasn’t hurt.

Behind him, the wall had opened like a sliding panel. Before him was a glowing portal, pulsing with blue light and swirling bricks.

Michael stood up, brushed off his tie, and blinked. ""What... the brick?""

Far above, in his room, Connor stared down at his LEGO set.

""Wait... I didn’t build that door,"" he whispered. ""Did I?""

Michael thought he was alone.

The glowing portal buzzed softly as he stepped closer, awestruck. The light reflected off his plastic suit, casting long shadows across the hidden chamber. He reached out—

""I wouldn’t touch that if I were you,"" said a cold voice behind him.

Michael spun around.

Mayor Brickwell.

The mayor's monocle gleamed ominously in the low light. ""You weren't supposed to find this.""

Michael blinked. ""Mayor Brickwell? What is this place? What's going on?""

Instead of answering, the mayor pulled back his jacket, revealing a gleaming silver revolver. He raised it slowly.

""You’re asking the wrong questions.""

Michael took a step back, heart racing. ""You're not making any sense!""

Before the mayor could fire, a roar echoed through the chamber—an engine.

CRASH!

A pink motorcycle burst through a side tunnel. The rider, a fierce-looking girl with pink hair and a black jacket, flew off the bike mid-air and tackled the mayor to the ground.

""GET AWAY FROM HIM!"" she shouted.

The revolver clattered across the floor.

Michael stared, stunned. The girl stood up, panting, then yanked him by the arm. ""No time to explain, suit guy. Come with me!""

""Who ARE you?"" Michael managed to say.

""Name’s Penny. Let’s ride.""

They jumped onto her bike and tore through the tunnel as alarms began to blare behind them.

A half hour later, they rolled into a hidden garage carved into a brick mountain far outside LEGO City. The massive metal doors slammed shut behind them. The garage lights flickered on, revealing a secret base filled with blueprints, vehicles, and strange glowing tech.

Waiting inside were three people.

First was a short ginger teen who looked about nineteen, chewing bubblegum and leaning against a crate. ""You're late, sis. And you brought a stray.""

""Michael, meet Reina—my little sister.""

Reina rolled her eyes. ""Welcome to the resistance or whatever.""

Next was a muscular man with wild black hair and a long scar over one eye. He crossed his arms and looked like he could punch through a wall.

""Stud,"" Penny introduced. ""He’s big and scary but cries if he sees a bird.""

Stud gave an embarrassed laugh. ""Hey man... birds just move weird.""

Before Michael could even process that, a familiar voice chimed in from behind a stack of pizza boxes.

""And you already know me—Pete!""

Michael’s jaw dropped. ""The pizza guy?!""

Pete waved. ""Yeah, also part-time secret agent. Also, still deliver on weekends.""

Michael stared at the group, stunned. ""What... what is going ON?""

Penny smirked. ""You fell through the wall, Brickson. Now you’re in it.""

Michael sat on a crate in the base’s main room, his head in his hands. Screens blinked with data. Diagrams of the portal, LEGO City, and something labeled “REAL WORLD” flashed on the walls. He looked up at Penny.

""So let me get this straight... you're telling me LEGO City isn’t all there is?""

Penny nodded. ""That’s right. Our world—this city, everything—we’re part of something much bigger.""

Reina popped a bubble with her gum. ""It’s called the Real World. Some kid named Connor built LEGO City.""

""Wait... Connor? As in, a person? Like a real person?""

""Yep,"" Pete said, leaning on a pizza box labeled *Top Secret*. ""Ten years old. Likes pizza. Really bad at controlling his elbows.""

Stud shivered. ""Also sneezes like a freight train.""

Michael stood up and began to pace. ""This... this doesn’t make sense. We’re toys?""

""We’re more than that,"" Penny said. ""Something changed. The city started living. We got thoughts, feelings... a purpose. But the mayor—Brickwell—he found out too. And he wants to control it.""

Michael turned toward her. ""Control what?""

Reina jumped in. ""Connor’s brain.""

He blinked. ""I’m sorry, WHAT?!""

""The mayor’s plan is to invade the kid’s mind,"" Penny explained. ""He believes if he can dominate Connor’s imagination, he’ll control every minifigure, every brick. Turn us all into obedient little slaves.""

""And the portal... it leads there?""

Penny nodded slowly. ""It’s the only way out of LEGO City. The only way into the Real World.""

The room went quiet.

Michael took a long breath. ""So what now?""

Pete slid over a slice of pepperoni pizza. ""Now? We plan. We stop the mayor. And maybe you figure out how deep this rabbit hole of bricks goes.""

Michael looked at the glowing schematic of the portal.

""Then let’s build a plan.""

1lp3zw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1lp3zw9/introducing_the_short_sweet_column_monthly/,"Introducing the Short & Sweet Column | Monthly Roundup (May and June, 2025. Edition)","Heya everyone!

[](#loliwave)

As you may have noticed, there’s been a dramatic increase in the number of Writing Club posts this month, specifically ones under the banner of the *Short & Sweet* column. Well, that’s because we’ve rebooted from the r/anime Writing Club to the r/anime *Awards* Writing Club (major difference, I know, haha). With that rebranding comes two factors: a broader awareness of the r/anime Awards and a renewed interest in promoting quality, written content for the sub.

##Emphasizing the r/anime Awards in r/anime Awards Writing Club

For the first point, it’s demonstrating what the r/anime Awards are: a positive environment that prioritizes thoughtful analysis about seasonal (and non-seasonal) shows. It's a community where we celebrate the best of anime each year while providing a platform for both casual and serious enthusiasts to appreciate craftsmanship beyond just the most popular shows. If you’ve been enjoying the pieces and would like to throw your hat into the ring to join our company, then I wholeheartedly recommend applying for Awards once the application comes out later this year! 

*Note, if you would like a notification tag for when the application comes out, you can leave a comment here saying so and we’ll tag you once it launches.*

##The Renewable Resources of Written Content

And as for my second point, I want to take a little school fieldtrip and talk about [this wonderful walk and talk scene from the 1999 television series *Sports Night*.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-va0tWJLTc) It’s really something else, a commanding scene on how William H. Macy metaphorically and also literally walks us to his point, that being one of shifting dynamics in the face of moral conviction. While walk and talks are a storytelling technique that usually pairs heavy exposition with a visual element, they also reflect institutional hierarchy and shifting perspectives. They’re rhythmic, systemic, and overall, just a lovely sight to see in dialogue-heavy works.

And I’d love to discuss this scene in so many more details, like how the television discovery is a parable to the story at hand or how the blocking represents progress towards an unimpeded goal. But as I look across the internet, there actually aren’t too many areas where I can do so. Besides the perennial blogs that dot throughout the net, there are a noticeable lack of spaces where people can gush in short yet sweet musings about a particular scene – and the larger subreddits, such as r/movies and r/television, certainly don’t provide this alleyway. 

##So, What Exactly is *Short & Sweet*?

This is why we launched *Short & Sweet* for r/anime. Providing an outlet for those undervalued voices and shows, we wanted this column to become a thoughtful companion for the sub, that bite-sized read to complement your morning coffee. We may not be able to rave about small scenes in TV shows or movies elsewhere on Reddit, but at least we can here.

So, there we go, this is what *Short & Sweet* is all about. It’s a semi-weekly column about any anime that catches our fancy, any concept we want to comfortably examine, all neatly wrapped up between 500-1000 words in a dedicated space. 

And for the month of May and June, we published some fantastic write-ups:

**Why This Pick?**

This is a wildly uneven matchup, friends – the Rangers should win this encounter by a landslide. Baltimore starter Brandon Young’s (7.11 ERA) last outing, comically, was against Texas last week – the Orioles were shutout 7-0. With Jacob deGrom (2.08 ERA) having allowed a mere 5 runs over his last 5 starts, I imagine this game’s result will be similar. I won’t overthink this one – I’m on the Rangers to cover the RL.

Hi! I'm a **fresh grad on my first job** ***(officially working for 3 months on July 22)***, and I have a strange dilemma. (I've also asked this question on the r/digitalbanksph subreddit and was invited by this one's mod to ask here as well. Thanks!)

**FOR CONTEXT:**

When I was getting ready to sign my contract for this job, I didn't have anything set up. I was being absorbed from my internship, and I only had GCash to my name.

So syempre, need nila ng bank account number-- ayokong humingi ng pang maintaining balance sa parents ko for BDO, so ekis muna. Nirecommend sakin ng coworker ko yung Unionbank kasi mabilis daw application, pero after 3 days of rejections (skill issue), I ended up opening a Seabank and a GoTyme account (out of stress and impulse) para makapagset-up na at makasweldo. On the fourth day of trying, naapprove yung Unionbank account ko. Then I got my first paycheck, I opened a BDO account with it para direct deposit nalang, since BDO and BPI lang supported ng company. In the end, bumalik din ako sa BDO lmao

Now I have all these banks na di ko nayu-utilize lahat fully, haha. Currently, I only use BDO to house my salary. Nagwi-withdraw din ako from my ATM para sa pamasahe. I move money to my Seabank account for EF, GoTyme for long-term saving goals (new phone), GCash for load, spotify subscriptions, and Angkas/Moveit/Joyride/Grab.

The initial plan was to use Unionbank as a [payslip](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1das7z3/comment/l7mj94x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), pero I don't actually know what that means and how to use it that way. Recently, I've been using it to pay for coffee and games as well as in-game purchases kasi minsan sinasabihan ako ni UB na hindi nakaindicate yung mobile number ko for online transactions.

**My question is**: may maa-advice ba kayo for this newly-indoctrinated corporate slave? Gusto ko sana malaman if I can drop a bank or wallet or two or if magagamit ko pa rin naman lahat somehow for different purposes and need lang ng crash course to optimize my bank usage.

My father, the Secretary of Defense, called me from the Pentagon with a classified line—he’d arranged my engagement to Louis Johnson.  
  
He seemed perfect on paper– not only handsome, but also the CEO of New York's biggest publicly traded companies.  
  
Considering my classified status, I couldn't take commercial flights—so the President personally lent me his personal armored Suburban. Just to make a statement.  
  
I arrived at my fiancé's company building right on time and was backing into a parking spot when a red Ferrari speeding toward me.  
  
I couldn't brake in time and crashed straight into it.  
  
Carrie Fletcher angrily rolled down her window and screamed at me:  
  
""You stupid bitch! Are you fucking blind?! Do you even know how to drive?""  
  
I bit back my anger and shot back: ""You're the one who stole my parking spot! How the hell is this my fault?""  
  
Facing with my question, she just looked at me with complete disdain.  
  
""Your parking spot? What a joke!""  
  
""Listen up, you worthless piece of trash – let me make it clear. In New York, the Johnson family owns everything. Even the air you breathe belongs to us. Got it?!""  
  
I stood there stunned for a second, then pulled out my phone and speed-dialed my fiancé.  
  
""Hey, Louis Johnson. So I'm hearing that your Johnson family runs New York. Is that actually true?""  
  
...  
  
Honestly, if it weren't for my dad, I wouldn't have even bothered making this call.  
  
Damaging my boss's ride wasn't something money could just fix.  
  
If my future husband showed some decent remorse, maybe I could pull some strings and make this whole mess disappear.  
  
""I'm busy. Whatever it is, make it quick.""  
  
His tone dripped with impatience.  
  
""Mr. Johnson, I really think you should come down here yourself, or—""  
  
But before I could finish, the line went dead.  
  
I stared at my phone in stunned.  
  
Are all rich guys this much of an ass?  
  
Seeing my reaction, Carrie who'd stolen my parking spot was cackling with glee.  
  
""Oh wow, I actually thought you were somebody important. Turns out you're a joker.""  
  
""My advice? Pay up now. Because when Mr. Johnson finds out his car got banged up, you might not make it out of New York in one piece.""  
  
She looked me up and down dismissively – young face, out-of-state plates. I was obviously not worth her concern.  
  
""Lady, are you completely insane?""  
  
""You're the one who cut me off and stole my spot. I haven't even gone after you yet, and now you're trying to shake me down?""  
  
I pointed up at the security camera overhead.  
  
""Everything's on tape. Keep twisting the facts and I'll call the cops right now.""  
  
When I mentioned calling the police, she got even more aggressive.  
  
""Save your breath, sweetie. Even when the cops show up, you'll just end up paying more.""  
  
The more agitated she became, the stronger the smell of alcohol got.  
  
I clenched my fists, my eyes narrowing.  
  
""You don't want me calling the cops because you've been drunk driving, right?""  
  
Then she immediately shoved me hard.  
  
""Whether I've been drinking is none of your damn business! Pay up now!""  
  
""Try to weasel out of this, and I swear you'll never leave New York!""  
  
After years working exclusively within Pentagon walls, I had zero experience dealing with people like this.  
  
Her arrogance was rapidly pushing me toward my limit.  
  
""You're the one who hit my car, and now you're trying to blame me? Are you out of your mind?""  
  
The crowd around us gasped.  
  
""Holy shit, this girl's got balls– mouthing off to Secretary Fletcher like that!""  
  
""Most people would run the other way when they see Mr. Johnson's car, and she actually crashed into it. That takes guts.""  
  
""Talk about rotten luck. Out of everyone in New York, she had to piss off Carrie Fletcher – Johnson's golden girl!""  
  
As the murmurs grew louder, Carrie got even cockier.  
  
""You little bitch! Did you just call me crazy? You must have a death wish!""  
  
Her threats didn't faze me. Hell, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
""So Carrie Fletcher, right? I suggest you watch your mouth.""  
  
""Push me too far, and even your precious boss won't be able to handle the fallout.""  
  
Her face flushed red. ""Go fuck yourself!""  
  
After hurling more insults, she still didn’t seem satisfied, then rolled up her sleeves and charged at me.  
  
""What's this? Typical. Loses the argument, picks a fight, huh?""  
  
Carrie threw several swings at me but couldn't even touch my cloth.  
  
""Stop dodging, you little bitch!""  
  
""I'm calling Mr. Johnson right now and telling him everything!""  
  
Despite her repeated provocations, I just kept dodging without retaliating—not because I was scared, but because my supervisor told me before leaving the Pentagon:  
  
""Your behavior out there represents this entire organization. No matter what happens, don't get into altercations with civilians.""  
  
Plus, I didn't really know how to fight.  
  
I don’t strike often—but when I do, I don’t miss.  
  
Seeing my silence, Carrie misread it as weakness and threw another punch.  
  
Just then, a furious shout came from behind me.  
  
""STOP!""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Carrie, you're my personal assistant. How can you be brawling in the street like some homeless thug?""  
  
Louis strode over, flanked by a phalanx of suited bodyguards.  
  
""You must be Jessica Bennett?""  
  
I sized up the man in front of me. I had to admit, Dad had decent taste.  
  
Six-foot-one of pure elegance wrapped in an Italian suit. If Hollywood was casting for a billionaire heartthrob, he'd be their first call.  
  
The only imperfection? It would be how cold his eyes looked at me.  
  
""Mr. Johnson, nice to finally meet you. Let me introduce myself properly.""  
  
""I'm Jessica Bennett, and I'm from—""  
  
""Save it."" Before I could finish, he cut me off with an impatient wave.  
  
""This arranged marrige won't work. Go back to wherever you came from.""  
  
For a second, I thought I’d misheard him.  
  
I’d just driven five straight hours from D.C. to New York—no stops, not even for coffee—and the first thing out of his mouth was to dismiss me before I could even finish a sentence?  
  
What did he think I was, a complete idiot?!  
  
My temper spiked instantly.  
  
""You must be the golden boy my father picked out – Louis Johnson, right?""  
  
""Don't you think it's a bit rude to send me packing before I've even finished introducing myself?""  
  
Louis's expression darkened immediately.  
  
""Rude?""  
  
""Miss Bennett, take a good look at that building. Do you honestly think you're in my league?""  
  
His gaze swept over me dismissively.  
  
""I can't fathom what my father was thinking, trying to burden me with a trophy wife.""  
  
The crowd erupted again.  
  
""Wait, what? This random girl is supposed to be Mr. Johnson's fiancée? No freaking way!""  
  
""Look at her – some small-town nobody thinking she can marry into New York royalty. Talk about delusional.""  
  
""Mr. Johnson is every woman's dream guy in our New York. I'm totally against this whole arrangement.""  
  
As the commentary got louder, I stood there somewhat stunned.  
  
When exactly had I said I wanted to marry this prick?  
  
Even if I did want to – which I definitely didn't – something like that would need approval from my superiors anyway.  
  
""Alright, fine. I'm just a trophy wife, you're the golden boy. Happy now?""  
  
I shrugged with exaggerated indifference. ""Since you're clearly not interested, how about returning the engagement money?""  
  
""My mom specifically told me that if we didn’t make it, I needed to get our money back.""  
  
That was complete bullshit – Mom had never mentioned anything like that. I just couldn't stand this guy's attitude.  
  
The moment I finished speaking, Carrie immediately jumped to his defense.  
  
""You little gold-digging bitch! Who the hell do you think you're talking to?""  
  
""Mr. Johnson is the youngest billionaire in New York history. You think he needs your pocket change?""  
  
Watching her performance, I finally understood what people meant by ""kiss-ass.""  
  
""Carrie, I just want my family's money back. What does his billionaire title have to do with anything?""  
  
Louis's face flushed red with anger.  
  
""Eight million? Fine, whatever.""  
  
He whipped out his phone and started tapping the screen.  
  
""I'm sending you ten million. Consider the extra twenty grand gas money.""  
  
I couldn't help smiling at his petty display of wealth.  
  
""How incredibly generous of you, Mr. Johnson.""  
  
Just as I turned to leave, Carrie's voice cut through the air.  
  
""Hey bitch! Don't you dare walk away!""  
  
I paused mid-step and slowly turned back around.  
  
""What now, Assistant Carrie? Planning to invite me to dinner?""  
  
Carrie shot me a venomous grin and whispered something in Louis's ear.  
  
The next second, New York's youngest billionaire exploded in an instant.  
  
""Jessica Bennett! You dare to crash into my car?!""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
From Carrie's smug expression, I could tell she'd been feeding Louis a steady stream of lies about me.  
  
Using him to do her dirty work – she'd really perfected that manipulation.  
  
Judging by Louis's attitude, I knew no amount of explanation would help. Why waste my breath?  
  
""Just name your price. I'll pay whatever damage there is.""  
  
Louis seemed caught off guard by my directness, his eyes flickering with surprise.  
  
""Pay? You think you can actually afford it?""  
  
""This Ferrari was my eighteenth birthday gift from my father. One of only three in the world, the only one in America.""  
  
""A single scratch on this car is worth more than your entire existence. What exactly are you planning to pay with?""  
  
I raised an eyebrow, a slight smile playing at my lips.  
  
""Mr. Johnson, just name your price. Whether I can afford it is my problem.""  
  
""Ten million!""  
  
Before Louis could respond, Carrie jumped in with her demand.  
  
""The entire front end is crushed. No American shop can handle this – it'll have to be shipped back to Italy for factory repairs.""  
  
The crowd collectively gasped.  
  
Even Louis looked startled by the figure.  
  
""Carrie, that car cost me just over ten million when I bought it. A bumper repair shouldn't cost that much.""  
  
Carrie waved her hand dismissively.  
  
""No, Mr. Johnson. You're thinking too narrowly.""  
  
""This wasn't just any car – it was a gift from your father on your eighteenth birthday. The sentimental value alone is priceless.""  
  
""Ten million is us being generous.""  
  
Louis considered her words, nodding slowly as if they made perfect sense.  
  
""Fine! Ten million it is. Deal!""  
  
I didn't give them a second to reconsider and answered immediately.  
  
Every eye in the crowd was now locked on me. Some thought I was bluffing, others suspected I was playing a deeper game, and the rest were just waiting for the show to crash and burn.  
  
But none of their opinions mattered to me.  
  
What mattered was that my vehicle had also been damaged.  
  
While not as severely as the Ferrari, there were still noticeable scratches along the rear panel.  
  
If this had been some ordinary American sedan, Carrie's reckless driving would have totaled it completely.  
  
""Now that we've settled your car, shouldn't we discuss mine?""  
  
My tone shifted, and I couldn't help but smile slightly.  
  
""Mine's domestic, so at least we won't need to ship it overseas for repairs.""  
  
Laughter erupted from the crowd immediately.  
  
Led by Carrie, her little fan club pointed at me with undisguised contempt.  
  
""This chick must be completely delusional. How much could some basic Chevy possibly be worth? I'll just write you a check for a brand new one right now.""  
  
""Can you believe it? Someone actually drove a Chevy to meet their billionaire fiancé. Talk about embarrassing.""  
  
I swept my gaze across the crowd, my voice cutting through their mockery.  
  
""Everyone, while this may just be a Chevy, do you see that special code embedded on the upper right corner of the windshield?""  
  
""Before bedtime—or, hell, before your grandparents drop dead—give them a call and ask them what a Chevy Suburban with those numbers really mean.""

Since then rising real estate prices, retirements, COVID and remote work have been killing many of them off but they are still out there, so let's hear yours. 

Here are two of mine:

Boston News Cafe is the building coffee shop in the lobby of 28 State Street. Today I had a sausage egg and cheese on a freshly baked biscuit that was downright outstanding and it was $6. They offer Starbucks coffee - double shot of espresso was $3. Just a good honest breakfast that didn't break the bank. 

This one is a little more elusive but you may see those trucks that drive to construction sites, affectionately called roach coaches.

1lp3w8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1lp3w8b/do_you_experience_awkward_silences_at_client/,Do you experience awkward silences at client dinners or at conferences?,"Hey everyone,

You know that feeling when you're at a client dinner or conference, and someone starts talking about a topic you have very little knowledge of — and you just nod along, fake laugh, or wish you had something to add? Or are you ever worried about running out of things to talk about?

I've been thinking about creating flashcards (calling them Closer Cards) to help make those moments less frequent. The goal is to build closer connections with prospects/clients at dinners, conferences, or networking events by learning more common knowledge topics that they follow.

A deck would cover topics in depth like wine, cigars, liquor, golf, cars, coffee, watches, boats, horses, military, or other things that often come up, so you don't feel lost or miss the chance to connect. And built only for salespeople. 

I think we have all experienced how it feels when you connect with someone vs. when you don't. It can be the difference between a 2 minute awkward conversation vs. a lifelong friend. Or a closed won vs. never getting the opportunity in the first place. 

Each deck would be broken down into 8 parts

1. Explain Like I'm 5 - a super simple breakdown anyone can understand.

2. Etiquette & Social Norms - what to do (and not do) in conversations or situations. AKA how do I smoke this cigar without looking like a dumbass. 

3. Buying & Gifting Guide - quick tips if you're purchasing or giving the item as a gift. AKA don’t necessarily just buy the most expensive one each time. 

4. Conversation Signs - what to look for to see if someone is interested in this topic.

5. Advanced Knowledge - deeper insights to spark conversation further.

6. Personalities & Situations - understand what will speak to each personality type.

7. Stories & Anecdotes - short, memorable stories you can retell.

8. Top Destinations & Experiences - must-visit places or things to try related to the topic.

And no, I'm not thinking of this as ""building rapport"" — it's more about giving yourself an easy way to explore a new topic in depth and built for the salesperson brain. 

A few questions: 

• Would you actually use this? 
• What topics would you want included? 
• Would you prefer a physical deck or a digital version? And how much would you pay?

1lp3w71,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lp3w71/does_my_friend_only_want_an_entourage_not_real/,"Does my friend only want an entourage, not real friends ?","I (23f) have this best friend (24f). We’ve been extremely close since we met 5 years ago. We’ve lived together, she moved to my city. She’s incredibly sweet, kind, caring, and we share so many niche interests. Our parents have the same names and jobs, we both grew up between two cities, our grandparents are from the same town… it’s always felt uncanny. We’ve been such good friends — until this year.

We’ve drifted apart a lot. It’s heartbreaking, but maybe that’s life. I can’t imagine she’s okay with it, but she’s not doing anything to stop it.

A few months ago she started a new full-time job. I wasn’t upset when communication slowed — big change, totally fair. But it never picked up again. It’s been around four months, and I haven’t seen her in two. She still says she’s “busy with work,” but she’s constantly out with school friends, going to festivals, etc. I’ve asked to catch up so many times, but it’s always “sorry I’m busy xxx” — with no alternative, or just one hour in two months for a coffee. It’s ridiculous.

I started thinking about when the drifting really started. Even before the job, she stopped wanting to do things I suggested, like gigs or galleries. I had an art show and she didn’t come — but told people to go to her work event instead. When I said I was hurt that our mutuals skipped my show, she snapped at me.

Then I realised: all she ever talks about is her cool life — but it’s always stories about other people doing wild things. None of it is really about her. She only wants to talk about how cool she seems. And when I talk, she doesn’t listen — or she gets frustrated — unless it benefits her somehow. I started wondering if she only values people when they bring her clout or flashiness.

Now I feel crazy that the illusion’s shattered. The only time she wants to talk or hang out is when: a) someone has something to offer her b) she wants an audience c) her other plans fall through

She steers every conversation back to herself — even if we’re talking about the weather. I could say, “It’s hot today,” and she’d go, “Not as hot as these two guys who invited me backstage at a gig…”

It’s bizarre. The thing is — if she just showed some real care, I’d want to hear about her weekends. I love her, and I’d be happy for her, like I used to be. But I guess I’m not cool enough anymore to be a tier 1 friend.

Her whole vibe is so patronising. It’s like everything has to be a competition, or revolve around her “brand.” She doesn’t show up for me. And somehow, her being “too busy” isn’t her fault.

Now she’s suddenly reaching out again — maybe her cooler plans have dried up. She invited me to a work event she’s working (not to catch up). Probably just wants to fill the room and bask in how cool she looks. She offered to hang out in two weeks because it’s the only time she’s free.

Has anyone seen Julie & Julia? That Cobb salad scene — “I don’t know when I can fit you in!” — “May I remind you, I don’t want to see you, you want to see me?” — “Would a breakfast work?” That’s how it always feels.

I don’t know what to do. I think she’s too far gone in this. She hasn’t been a good friend to me, and I don’t think she cares

TL;DR:
My best friend of 5 years has totally drifted from me. She only seems interested in me when it serves her socially, never makes time for me, and talks only about herself. I’ve tried to stay connected, but I feel used and pushed aside. Not sure if I should confront her or let the friendship go. Feeling angry and wanting validation or justice.

I just recently met my boyfriend (24M) in person again after 1.5 years of not seeing each other, and my gut was telling me something was off. There was no proof just a strong feeling that something wasn’t right.

That gut feeling led me to dig a little, and I found out that he had been active on three dating apps while we were still very much together. Not just installed he was actively having conversations with girls and even met one of them in person.

When I confronted him about it, he first denied everything and started lying but eventually admitted it and claimed that he did talk to girls and the one he met with was just platonically. He said they got coffee and just “talked as friends.” But the truth is, they spent 5–6 hours together, roaming around the city, and during that time I was completely ghosted by him no texts, no updates, nothing bcs to me he said he was out with friends and he even put up a bad fight with me bcs I called him. It didn’t feel like an innocent meet-up. And honestly, I don’t believe the “just friends” excuse, especially since they met through a dating app.

He’s now begging for forgiveness. He says he made a mistake, that it didn’t mean anything, and that he’s very, very sorry. And I’m just…numb. This was a relationship full of love and hope for a future together being married.

this is the first time he’s done anything like this. For all these years, he was loyal and I never had doubts. But now that I know he was doing this behind my back while I was missing him, trusting him, and waiting something inside me feels completely broken. The betrayal feels unreal and Im in disbelief. I gave him my whole life. and loved him very very much. my world feels crashing down on me. 
And im here to ask how to cope with everything. 

I’ve always believed that cheating should never be forgiven. It’s a line you don’t cross. But now that I’m here, I’m stuck in this weird place of disbelief. After six years, it’s hard to just flip a switch and walk away, even though I know I probably should.

Right now, I don’t even know what step to take next,If I block him, I’m scared I’ll get curious later and unblock him. If I deactivate my Instagram, I might just reactivate it to check what he’s doing.
If I leave things open, I’ll probably read his messages, and maybe even respond even though I don’t want to. 
Its been two days and he keeps asking for forgiveness.

1lp3uo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lp3uo7/reveal_if_the_best_coffee_maker_cuisinart_dgb850/,Reveal if the best coffee maker Cuisinart DGB-850 lives up to hype,"Cuisinart DGB-850 is one of those kitchen gadgets that feels like a luxury at first glance, but has slowly become my daily lifesaver. As a caffeine addict (I mean, “coffee enthusiast”), testing this coffee maker has been both exciting and revealing. Being a refurbished model adds an interesting dimension to its appeal—it’s inspected, tested, and reasonably priced for what it offers. However, it’s not perfect, and I’ll walk you through both the glowing and not-so-glowing sides of this product.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek silver and black design fits right into my modern kitchen, blending aesthetics with functionality. Its dimensions are hefty, though: 10.75""D x 14.25""W x 19.25""H, which meant giving it a dedicated corner on my counter. The 10-cup thermal carafe with a comfort-grip handle is a strong point—it’s great for large households or the chronically under-caffeinated (like me). I loved that the carafe kept coffee hot for hours without sacrificing flavor. The clear, extra-large LCD is easy to read, even during those early-morning, pre-coffee fogs. However, this machine is undeniably heavy at 16.73 pounds, which made setting it up feel like a workout. 

**Functionality and Usability**  
Using this machine is as straightforward as it gets. With buttons as its interface, it’s beginner-friendly while still catering to more seasoned coffee lovers. The DirectFlow grind assembly is a standout feature, eliminating messy grounds from the process by dispensing them directly into the brew basket. The AutoRinse function is just chef’s kiss—it ensures no grounds are wasted, which is a nitpicky pet peeve I didn’t know I had. Oh, and the grind-control options? Absolute gold. I could brew anywhere from 4 to 10 cups with choices for regular, bold, or extra-bold strength settings. This lets my family and I fine-tune personal preferences easily.  

[Check Cuisinart DGB-850 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07ymv2zbd/)

**Merits**  
- The half-pound bean hopper, with its sealed lid, keeps coffee beans fresh until use. No one likes stale beans, and this safeguards your coffee’s aroma.  
- The grind-off feature is handy for those mornings when I’m too lazy to grind fresh beans. Pre-ground coffee works without a fuss.  
- I was surprised by how useful the Brew Pause feature was. Waiting for an entire pot to brew used to feel like an eternity, but here, I could sneak a cup mid-brew.  
- It’s a legitimate multitasker with a 24-hour brew-start timer, so waking up to the smell of fresh coffee meant fewer grumpy mornings.  

**Drawbacks**  
- While the machine does a great job grinding and brewing, cleaning it is far from effortless. The grind and brew components take commitment, especially if you’re someone who despises washing dishes.  
- It emits a noticeable noise while grinding, which startled me at first. For early risers with roommates or family, this might be a minor annoyance.  
- The thermal carafe is efficient in keeping coffee hot but isn’t the easiest to clean thoroughly. Residue tends to build up over time.  
- There’s a learning curve with the controls. While they are intuitive, first-timers may require some trial and error, especially with the grind strength adjustments.  

**Rival Brands**  
After spending some time with this coffee maker, I couldn’t resist comparing it with a few others. Brew-wise, the Cuisinart DGB-850 gives the Breville Grind Control a run for its money. However, the Breville boasts slightly better grind consistency, which might be a game-changer for espresso enthusiasts. On the flip side, the DGB-850 feels sturdier and easier to program. Competing with Keurig’s K-Café is a different story; their versatility falls in Keurig’s favor with milk frothing options. But the freshness from grinding beans sets this one apart from the typical pod machines that rely on pre-packaged grounds.  

**Quality for Price**  
Looking at the value this coffee maker offers, particularly as a refurbished machine, it holds its own quite well against pricier competitors. You’re essentially getting the features of a premium burr grinder and drip coffee maker combined. It’s the kind of investment that pays off if you prioritize freshly ground coffee every morning. While it might not be friendly to one’s wallet outright, its durability and features balance out the cost in the long term.

When I was (17M) I started working at a coffee shop in mid-July where I met my trainer at the time (25F). Let’s call her Jane. 

As a part of training we had a good amount of closing shifts together where it was just the two of us. She had a boyfriend at the time, call him John, (26ishM) and she would open up to me about all of the problems she and John had.
After all, I was a good listener.

Eventually around October, I reached out to her through the DMs to share some memes we joked about at work, and we started to develop a friendship.

It’s easy to talk to her because she’s a really sweet person and I was a complete loner at this point.

Fast forward to January, my family goes out of town and I have the house to myself, so I invite her over to hang out and watch movies (seriously). Eventually we get closer and get a bit frisky, but not all the way (not a crime in my state, I checked).

She feels weird because she’s still with John, but not weird enough to not come over the next night… or the next night.

So throughout the month of January, we’re texting back and forth constantly, ended up totaling over 11,000 messages sent between us (I counted).

February rolls around and things get really rocky because Valentine’s Day is coming up. We stop talking. Things are really, REALLY weird at work.

Then, we start talking again the night of a work party, reconcile a bit, and then get into the conversation of what to do about John. My 18th birthday was in April so I said I wanted her to break up with John so I could date her.

At this point my parents know we have a thing and are (reasonably) not okay with this at all. But given how my relationship with them had been, they couldn’t really stop me.

So on my 18th birthday we make it official, hook up in the back of my car, and go on dating. It kinda sucked missing my senior prom because my date was too old, but that didn’t really matter to me because I had an official girlfriend.

I take a summer math class at a community college because my grades were ass in high school from having major undiagnosed depression. Turns out, John was also taking that class, so that was fun.

Fast forward to January of the following year: I start at a state university living in the dorms, and she’s teaching as an elementary teacher at the school that I went to. 

I make some friends in college, start working in the dining hall and a coworker catches my eye, call her Jill (19F), but I don’t really get to know her outside of talking about my relationship with Jane.

Every few weeks Jane visits my dorms, and my dorm mate was never around so she’d stay the weekend then go back home 2 hours away.

Summer comes around, I start talking more to Jill and she’s sweet and easy to talk to. Eventually, I reached out to her through the DMs to share some memes we joked about at work, and we started to develop a friendship. (Seriously.)

At this point it’s the end of July and I’m talking to Jane about her moving up to my college town because the relationship is getting more serious. So she does, starts teaching elementary again nearby and I’m basically living in her apartment.

In the fall, I start a calculus class and in the first day, a girl, call her Jen (F18) asks for my number to start a study group. So I give it to her.

Come September, Jill and I start hooking up. I make excuses to Jane that I need to go study for my classes and do homework. I’d have a late night with Jill, wake up the next day and go to church with Jane.

I did this for 3 weekends, and eventually someone I was making friends with at our young adults group, call him Joe, noticed that there seemed something off with me.

I told Joe about what was happening with Jill and he said I should do the right thing and tell Jane about it. He said either we’d get through it or the relationship wasn’t meant to be.

So a week later I proposed.

At this point I was thinking there was no way in hell I was telling Jane about cheating on her. She had moved cities, had been in a series of rough relationships and I was so full of shame that I thought the only thing I reasonably could do was brush this under the rug, marry the girl and have and start having kids when I graduated. 

But I still had Jen’s number… and we were talking. Not often but we’d get into casual conversation about my relationship with Jane and eventually talked about how I had cheated on her with Jill. After that our conversations got spicy. 

Things were getting worse and the cracks were starting to show. 

Jane was suspicious at this point I was acting hella suspicious. But we were planning a wedding at this point and it was set for 8 months after the engagement.

I had never gotten physical with Jen but that’s honestly due to a lack of opportunity. We were having sex, it was just digital, but that honestly doesn’t make a difference. It was cheating, again.

Things got rocky with Jen. The relationship we had wrecked her self-esteem and it was tough for her to interact with me. So come March of the following year, I had called it entirely off with her. I told we her I’d be getting married in 3 months and I can’t continue this into a marriage.

Thank god 2 weeks later Joe called me for a cup of coffee. He sat me down and gave me an ultimatum: tell Jane by Friday about Jill or he would (he didn’t know about Jen). And so I agreed.

Friday came around, and I had dinner with Jane at her apartment. I told her I had cheated on her once with Jill and she was devastated. But she didn’t want to call off the wedding. She said we’d get counseling and we’d continue on.

Then the next day we were talking more, and I said it was multiple times with Jill. She was even more hurt and we agreed that the wedding was off but we’d still try to work things out.

Then the next day, I told her it was multiple times with multiple people and that was the nail in the coffin. It was over.

I packed my things from her place. She said I had to call her parents and tell them. I did. And I haven’t spoken to her since.

There was a huge mess with her parents and non refundable deposits. Lawyers got involved but we kept Jane out of it. I was 19 when we broke up, 2 months before the wedding.

This was years ago at this point and I’ve been through a whole bunch of shit since then. The reason why I ask AITA is because most people I’ve talked to have been fault and friends and they definitely have bias toward me.

19 year olds are still adults and I’m responsible for my actions. I did shitty things. I’m 26 years old now and  I look at someone 8 years younger than me and I don’t see someone even remotely close to relationship material. I see a kid.

1lp3s0a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lp3s0a,"Christmas Letter from Ft. Bragg – 1942, from my Jewish Grandfather to his folks, with the original enclosures – a dinner menu & a weekend pass showing “the new Army time.” 
Transcription & Additional context in post.","I’ve been working through my grandfather’s letters from his first few months in the Army (Sep 1942-Mar 1943), and found this Christmas letter that accompanies several other items I found months ago, so I wanted to share them altogether, because I think it paints a neat little snapshot of his life 3 months into training.

Below is the full transcript of the letter, along with notes, photos, and links to add context, including the original enclosures:

 



*Friday*

December 25*^(th)* *1942*

*Christmas Day*

 

*Dear Mother, Dad, Dorothy, and Morty,*

*Well here it is another Christmas. I had expected to spend this Christmas with you but I guess that turkey will have to wait until next year.*

*We were given quite the dinner by Uncle Sam.  I’m enclosing a menu**^(1)**. It was a regular banquet.*

*The weather is very warm again: No sign of snow or anything else Christmassy.*

*Last night – Christmas Eve – I made an early show at the movie – “Ice capades of 1942” (Not very good – but put me in good spirits). After the show we went back to our old Battery D-11-4 where they were having a Christmas Eve party.  There we had turkey sandwiches, cake, candy and coffee.  About 9 o’clock we went to the Enlisted mens Service Club and sang Christmas carols.  They served cake and fruit while singing.  I saw a boy I used to work with at the Commonwealth Title Company.  He and I became settlement clerks at the same time. We had a swell time talking as he has been in the Army just two weeks.  At 12 midnight all of the boys went to mass.  I decided to go along too.  There were some 2000 Catholics and 1 heathen (me). I found the service very interesting but the Chaplin was rather dull.  He didn’t put his heart into the singing or sermon as the Rabbis do.  The things that made the mass interesting were the bright red and green lights and colors and the ringing of bells.*

*We had Thursday and today off. That is everyone has those two days off, I’ve been doing nothing all week.*

*When I send you the telegram last Monday, I also sent one to Mickie. She had called me on the Phone Sunday afternoon to Congratulate me**^(2)* *and to ask if I was coming home.  When she got my telegram she wired back saying she was coming down here to see me.  I wired her back telling her not to come as I knew the railroads would be too crowded and also I wasn’t sure I could get a pass to see her. It was swell of her to want to make the trip down here though. You see there is no fear of me getting married as there are plenty in numbers. What with Mickie, Ann, Margie (From Pittsburgh) and one I haven’t even spoken about, Ruth, I guess I’m safe – Darn it.*

*Sunday I leave for Fort Sill.  I’ll get there by Tuesday night and start school Wednesday morning.*

*Sill is only 200 miles from Texas University where Alan Werr is: hope to pay him a visit**^(3)**.*

*I’m glad that the family is as happy as I am over this golden opportunity. I only hope I can make the grade.  Now that everyone knows why I can’t write I hope they will write me more after even though they will receive no mail from me**^(4)**.*

*Did Louis and Florence get in for the holidays? How are they? What did Santa Claus bring Shirly****^(4)****?*

*Love to everyone*

*Your Son and brother*

*Marv*

*P.S. Enclosed is a weekend pass**^(5)* *showing the new Army time: the 211800 means Dec 21 5 pm & the 220600 is Dec 22 6 am.*

 

Context/enclosures:

(1) Enclosed Dinner Menu - (Second Image)

(2) ""Congratulations"" – My grandfather had just been selected for OCS at Ft. Sill. Family lore says he failed to get in the first time due to his math grades (still trying to confirm that through the letters), but he would eventually complete OCS and commission as a field artillery officer.

(3) Context/Letters from Alan – I have a postcard and letter from Alan, which I’ll post separately. It seems unlikely (but possible) they got to meet up as based on that letter they both seem exceptionally busy and with no convenient way to visit.

(4) Louis/Shirley Christmas – My grandfather was raised as a Jewish assimilationist, meaning the family believed Jews should blend in to avoid drawing attention. This often included celebrating Christmas from a cultural, not religious, perspective. That mindset shifted significantly in the years after WWII. Louis was his older brother, and I knew Aunt Shirly well.

(5) Enclosed Enlisted Pass (third image)– This is the pass with the dates and times referenced in the letter, including his example of “new Army time.”

Temp: 93-96°C
Coffee: 16g
Water: 210g
Time: 3-3:30 mins
Method: Inverted 

Steps:-
1. Add coffee and about 60gms of water at the suggested temperature for bloom. Stir a few times to get all the grounds wet.
2. Wait for 45 secs from pour.
3. At 45s, add the rest of the water upto 210g. Stir well a few times.
4. Wait for 1 Min 15 Secs from pour.
5. Carefully fix the end and hold a glass and then flip it over. (I didn't realise the glass the first times and it got a little messy :))
6. After flipping, stir it around a little, especially if some grounds stick to the seal.
7. Wait for 30-40 secs.
8. Press down slowly over 30 secs.

Review: Don't have a lot to compare to but overall the coffee had a good body. Previous few times I had a little sour aftertaste but it wasn't there now. It was clean cup you could say. 

P.S. Please do comment your own recipes or any preferred recipes. Would love to learn a lot of new recipes!!

My boss was alcoholic and abusive. After my internship was done I couldn't get the emotional support I needed from my family and I spent the next term depressed. My sleep schedule got messed up and I drank coffee to make up for it. In January 11, I drank a strong cup of coffee 2-3 hours before I left the place I lived in. When I was waiting for the bus I felt dizzy and breathless. I felt like the world was going to collapse on me and my heart was gonna explode. Luckily, a bus came shortly afterwards and I pleaded the driver to leave in front of the ER. My heartbeat rate was at 180 BPM. Numbness that was in my left arm spead into my chest, my legs, and my jaw. I thought this was going to ne the end. Thankfully, the doctors took care of it and I was out in two hours. I missed the train to my hometown, so my family came and took me home the day after.

After I got home, I went to see a psychiatrist about my anxiety. The psychiatrist prescribed me Sertraline. In the first days of using the medicine, I was feeling really tired and my heartbeat was shooting up whenever I layed down or stood up too fast. I stayed there for two weeks in total and nothing bad happened as long as I stayed home.

When I was going back to the university by a train, I felt the rapid heartbeat again. I tried to calm down by breathing deeply, but it didn't work. I called my mum in panic about what should I do. She told me to take an half a pill of Sertraline. I didn't think that would work, but it did.

As I continued to use the drug, I noticed some changes. I was feeling better but I was feeling bloated whenever I had some food. Gas was building up in my stomach and I was feeling dizzy and having tachycardia again. So I would take Sertraline after lunch or dinner. I wasn't eating too much or too quick. I asked my psychiatrist if the drugs were causing the problem, but she said they weren't. I have seen several cardiologists and a neurologist. I had multiple ECGs, an MR, and an EEG. But they couldn't find anything. I felt that I was very unlucky and once joked that I would probably die on my way to doctor before they could find anything. 

I searched up what is wrong with me and I found a different result everytime. I don't like to self-diagnose but I feel like it's the drugs that affect me like this. I haven't been feeling as anxious as I was back in the winter. So I don't really understand why is this happening to me.",1,1751380984.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I tried to ignore him, but now it's too late.","My name is Silas, and for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a man standing at the end of the street, just outside my view. At first, I thought it was a neighbor or maybe someone passing through. But he’s always there… watching. Every day, he has gotten a little closer than he was the day before. Every time I saw him, he was in the distance, standing perfectly still. He never moved when I was watching, but somehow kept creeping toward me during the night… the sunrise revealing his slow, inconceivable movement… always unsettlingly closer… his presence more foreboding with each passing day. He stands there… staring at me. I’ve tried to ignore him… to convince myself it’s nothing. But now he is so close that I can’t sleep anymore. I can feel his gaze pressing in on my soul. I’m not asking for help… I only ask that you heed my warning. I am putting myself in immense danger by writing this. Please read my story and hopefully learn from it.

It all started around the time I dropped out of college... a time filled with drunken escapades. Two years of squandered potential and broken promises created a rift between my family and me, tearing at the seams of an already rocky relationship. I had a childhood filled with fuckups and bad grades. I grew up in my brother’s shadow, who was perfect at pretty much everything. His name is Stephen. He moved away after he graduated from college, never looking back. I envied him for that. I don’t think I received more than a C in anything compared to his A’s and A+’s. My parents had paid people in high places to get me into college like my brother, and all I did was fail them. Ultimately, I was expelled from school. I couldn’t live up to their expectations. It was because of my own insolence and self-righteous behavior that my parents disowned me. My dad was harsh about it… I knew he would be.

“Find somewhere else to go, you are no longer welcome here.” My dad said, his eyes bloodshot with rage. “Your mother and I have nearly bankrupted ourselves to send you to college, and this is how you repay us? Get your shit and get out.”

He angrily stomped down the stairs to where my childhood room was. I could hear crashes and bangs from the stairs as I sat on the living room couch in shock. My whole life had been swept out from under me, and I had to accept it. It was my doing after all.

Dad stomped back up the stairs carrying handfuls of old CDs and posters. He was even nice enough to grab my favorite bong. He threw everything on the floor in front of me, waiting for me to say something in response. I stayed silent as he laid into me.

“That’s not all of it, but it’s a start.” He said, “You have until tomorrow at noon to get everything out of here, and if it’s not… it’s going in the fucking garbage.”

He leaned down so that his eye line met mine.

“I told your mother we didn’t need another kid… but of course, you came anyway. Your brother is ten times the man you will ever be.”

I pulled my stare from the floor, leveling it into my dad’s eyes. They were cold and sharp, like the eyes of a shark eyeing its prey.

“Don’t worry, Dad, I’ll leave and never bother you again…” I said in a defiant tone, voice trembling. “Once I’m gone, you’ll no longer have to live with your mistakes.”

His eyes widened as he leaned back, now standing upright.

“You little bastard!” He yelled as he brought his left hand across my cheek… his wedding ring rattling my teeth.

I fell across the couch, holding my face.

“I fucking hate you.” I whimpered in a painful moan.

“The feeling’s mutual.” He responded as he walked out of the living room.

That night, after my mom returned home from work, I pleaded to her for leniency. I desperately asked for another chance… to let me at least show her that I could change my behavior.

“I can change, Mom.” I pleaded, “Just give me another chance to make things right.”

“I’m so sorry, Silas… I love you, you know that!” She said, “But… but this is for the best.”

It felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room. She began crying softly, having delivered the killing blow to my already dying hope. Sitting across from her, all I could do was stare into the burled wood of the dining room table. Following the swirling pools of woodgrain with my eyes, my mind drifted into thoughts of suicide. Maybe if I were no longer here, then she would feel bad for not giving me a chance. Maybe dad would feel something… anything.

I climbed into bed, pondering how I would end my life. I thought about what it would be like if it all just went black. Would it hurt? Would it last long? I had so many questions running through my mind about something that seemed so inconceivably awful to do. I had run out of options… this was now my only outlet.

“Maybe tomorrow, I’ll do it,” I muttered to myself as I lay looking at my bedroom ceiling.

My mind wandered on as my eyes became heavy and finally closed. I felt sleep’s warm embrace flow over me… pulling me into a brief respite. It was suddenly halted by a sound rattling against the window. I felt my senses return as I opened my eyes, glancing over at the windowsill. I could hear a tapping noise. It was light, but rhythmic. It sounded like someone was tapping out a song through their knocks.

Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap… Tap… Tap.

The sound repeated over and over. I climbed out of bed and walked over to see what was causing the noise.

As I peered out the window, the tapping ceased. I looked in all directions as far as I could, but there was nothing to be seen. I looked across the yard and into the street. I instinctively followed the road with my eyes, looking further down toward the edge of the neighborhood. At the limit of what I could physically see from my window, there was a streetlight shining down on the cold pavement. Underneath its glow was a small, black shadow. Intrigued, I focused on the shadow, squinting my eyes trying to make out what it was. As my eyes adjusted, I could see that it was a person who seemed to be wearing a tall hat. They were barely visible but unmistakably staring at me… I could feel it.

I felt a strangeness crawl over my mind. My consciousness was commanding me to look. I could feel a burning sensation spread across my eyes, as if the person’s gaze were burning my corneas.

“Who the hell is that?” I asked myself.

I stood at the window, watching them… waiting for them to move. The intense staring made my eyes heavy. I blinked to refresh my vision, re-focusing on where the person stood. They were gone. In the time between my eyes blinking, the person had disappeared completely.

With the person no longer visible, I was snatched out of my trance. I scanned the road, back and forth, looking for any trace of them. Now, with nothing there, my senses dulled once more. As I felt sleep curl its way back into my brain, I climbed back into bed… the mystery of the figure’s gaze having taken my full attention… pulling my mind away from the dark thoughts of ending my own life. I no longer contemplated suicide. Every synapse in my brain flickered with thoughts of who that person was… why were they there? Why were they staring at me? I watched the window from bed for as long as I could. The tapping had subsided, leaving silence in its place. I drifted into a deep slumber… the image of the black figure still hovering in my mind.

The next morning, I was startled awake by a loud clattering noise… the vision of the man having long faded from my mind, now replaced with chaos. My dad was grabbing my things and throwing them out of my room and into the hallway. When he saw that I was awake, he didn’t hesitate to let me know what was happening.

“Good, you’re awake.” He said, “Now get your ass out of bed and carry the rest of your shit out of here.”

I sighed with discontent as I got out of bed and began gathering my things. I had not even had a shower or brushed my teeth, and yet I was already being pushed away. Mom walked in and hugged me, trying to comfort me.

“I love you, Silas. Please never forget that I love you,” She said, her voice trembling, “And never forget that you can always call me if you need anything.”

Her words felt so empty… so hollow. I heard ‘I love you’ but just felt betrayed. Mom was supposed to be there for me. My dad, on the other hand, had always hated me. I expected this from him.

At noon, I was on my own. There was no send-off for me. They stood on the porch as I backed out of the driveway. Mom started crying and retreated into the house. A smile curled around Dad’s face as he waved and yelled,

“Good luck.”

“Fucking prick,” I said through gritted teeth.

I put my old 2002 Accord in drive and headed toward the only person I knew I could still count on… Rob’s house.

Rob was a good friend of mine whom I had met during my short collegiate stint. He was a junior when I started as a freshman, so he was able to get me into bars and places that only the older crowd knew about. He had taken me under his wing. He was truly a good friend… albeit a terrible influence. He was partially to blame for why I had been kicked out in the first place. I called him on my way to his place to catch him up on the situation.

“Hello?” He said as he answered the phone.

“Yo, Rob! It’s me, Silas. I need to crash at your place for a little while… if that's cool.”

“Silas! What’s up, man? No problem at all, what’s going on?” He responded.

I could hear how hungover he was by the sound of his voice… but I knew he would help me.

“Long story, man, I’ll explain when I get there.” I told him, “Be there in ten.”

I arrived at Rob’s place, pulling into his oil-stained driveway. As he helped me unload my things, I gave him the full story in all of its detail.

“Woah… man that is some fucked up shit.” He said, reacting to my story.

“Yeah, man, I just need to get on my feet, and I will be out of your hair,” I assured him.

“No worries, stay as long as you need. I’m always here, man.” He replied with a smile.

I thanked him for his hospitality. I had thought long and hard about ending it all the night before, and if it weren’t for Rob, I probably would have followed through with it.

The next day, I woke up in an empty house. Stumbling half-awake to the kitchen, I saw a note sitting on the counter. I picked it up, blinking my eyes as I read it.

‘Silas,

Had to run into work. I should be back around 4:30 this afternoon. There are some snacks in the pantry, or some Chinese from a couple of nights ago in the fridge if you’re hungry. Make yourself at home.

Peace,

Rob’

I smiled as I finished reading the note, feeling actually at home for once. I walked around the house, exploring my temporary home. I walked to the back of the house and saw that there was a back door that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades. I opened it and was met with a literal brick wall. It seemed that the previous owners had once had a back porch or patio but had removed it and bricked over the opening. The house had several oddities like this.

The shower heads were backwards so that hot water was cold and vice versa. Sometimes you had to jiggle the toilet handle to get it to stop filling after flushing. It had its quirks, but I was grateful to be here. I got dressed and headed out to start the move-in process. I was unpacking my car when I spotted someone about three blocks away, standing in the middle of the road.

My attention was now fully directed at this person. I recognized them… It was the person I had seen the night prior… but this time they were closer. Even across the distance, I could make out the tall black hat they were wearing. They were now close enough that I could see that it was a man. He was wearing a black duster jacket that shrouded his black pants… and, of course, a tall black hat. I stood, staring at the man, curious as to what he was doing and why he was undoubtedly staring at me. With a blink of my eyes, the man disappeared, a car now traveling through the spot where he had been standing.

“I think I’m losing it,” I told myself with a small laugh.

I finished unpacking my car and began rebuilding my broken life.

I had now witnessed two instances of what seemed to be the same person staring at me from a distance. It was so bizarre… so out of place, that I couldn’t just ignore it anymore. My curiosity wouldn’t let me get it out of my mind. When Rob returned from work, I asked him about the guy.

“Hey, man. Do you happen to know anyone around here who stands in the middle of the road staring at people?” I asked in a serious tone.

He must’ve thought I was joking because he laughed at me as if I’d delivered the punch line of the century.

“Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you high?” He asked, still laughing at my question.

“No… I’m serious… I need to know.” I responded, not amused by his childish demeanor.

He could see the seriousness on my face and abruptly stopped laughing.

“Oh shit… you’re serious aren’t you?” He asked, his face now scrunched in concern.

“Yes… I am serious. I saw a guy in all black standing in the middle of the street.” I replied, “Today was the second time I’ve seen him, and I want to know if that’s someone you know… the dude has a creepy vibe, man.”

He looked at me, half believing me and half not.

“Nah man, I can’t say that I know anybody that would be wearing that type of stuff… or doing creepy shit like that.” He said as he sat back in his chair.

Silence filled the room once more as I pondered the man’s appearance. I thought I must be going crazy or having a mental episode. I had been going through immense stress lately… it was probably just a manifestation of my pent-up anxiety. I spent the rest of the night catching up with Rob and talking about what the future might hold.

The next morning was a Saturday. Rob had agreed to help me look for a job before he left the next day for a camping trip. We hopped in his car and headed to town, looking for any places that might be hiring. We must’ve hit dozens of spots in town… all of them being dead ends. As a last-ditch effort, we stopped by the library on the way back home. Sometimes, local businesses will leave their applications on the bulletin board for people to find. By a stroke of luck, I found an application for a job at the local bottling plant stapled on the old, crusty corkboard. I filled it out and faxed it over to them using the library fax machine. I was now playing the waiting game. When or if they would call was a mystery, but I had to try.

Rob and I drove back to his house, exhausted from the job hunt. The last couple of days were exactly what I had needed after the shitshow at my parent’s place. I finally felt at ease… like I could let my guard down a bit. The closer we got to Rob’s house, the further and further I felt my mind drift.

“So, you think you’ll get it?” Rob asked.

“Get what?” I asked in confusion.

“The job, dumbass… the one you just put in for like ten minutes ago.” He said sarcastically.

“Oh… uh, well, I hope so… I mean, it would be nice to be able to make some money while I look for a place,” I responded.

My mind had gone elsewhere. I truly felt like I might be losing my mind. Something just felt… off. We coasted down a small hill, straightening out onto a mile-long stretch of road that led straight to Rob’s house. The late evening sun sliced through the trees, casting long, dim shadows on the pavement. The warm breeze swirled a light fog across the road, further disorienting my mind.

As the headlights leveled out, I could see a black mass in the middle of the road, shrouded in fog.

“Hey, Rob… you see that?” I asked, sitting up straight in my seat and craning my neck closer to the windshield.

“Nah man, what are you talking about?” He asked.

“There’s… something in the road up there,” I said, now pointing toward the mass. “It’s a person, I think.”

Rob slowed the car and squinted up the road, desperately searching for what I was pointing at.

“I’m not seeing what you’re talking about, man… It’s foggy as shit.” He said, accelerating back up to normal speed. “It must’ve been a dog or something, but it’s gone now.”

The headlights shook up and down with the bumps in the road, bathing the figure in light. Nearing even closer, I could now see that the figure was a person… it was the man I had seen before.

“Rob! That’s the guy! That’s the guy that I saw staring at me the other day!” I yelled, now pointing and shaking my finger desperately at the fast-approaching figure.

“Where? I don’t see anybody… what are you talking about?” He asked frantically, as if he didn’t see the man standing there.

The man was now dangerously close. He stood, unmoving in the road… staring directly into the headlights.

“He’s right there, man! You’re going to hit him! Stop! Stop!” I yelled, grabbing Rob’s shoulder and pulling.

“What the fuck, Silas!” Rob yelled as he slammed his brakes.

Rob shifted the car into park and began screaming at me. The man was now a couple of feet away from the hood… staring directly at me. My hearing began to fade as Rob’s voice slowly melted into a shrill ringing noise.

My hearing was gone… my heart thudding in my chest. Seeing the man standing so close paralyzed me… an icy grip crawling across my body. Time seemed to slow down as I examined his features. He wore a pair of old, black leather boots… tattered and worn from abuse. His pants were made of old black denim that was torn and faded. They reminded me of the kind that miners and ranchers used to wear a century ago. The jacket he wore was indeed a duster, but it was heavily weathered, as if it had seen a hundred years of travel and use… the leather flapping in the evening breeze. Finally, my eyes made their way to his head. I could not fully see his face due to the car being so close, but I could see the outline of his hat in the light. It looked to be about a foot tall and had a thick brim encircling it.

He stood there, staring at me for what seemed like an eternity. Through the haze of the evening light, I could see small glints under his hat where his eyes should’ve been. I stared into the small orbs of light as they began to shift and twirl as if they were trying to say something to me. My vision darkened, only allowing a small tunnel of light to come through… just enough to outline the man’s figure. My heartbeat grew louder in my head, sending waves of sound across my vision… wavy ripples pulsed around the man’s body. The white orbs put me in a trance. I could not pry my gaze away from them. The small glints grew larger and brighter, commanding my full attention. They were so beautiful…

Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain shoot through my shoulder. I blinked, sending everything into darkness and silence. For a split second, I felt like I was dead. When I came to, the man was gone. Rob was punching my shoulder… screaming at me to wake up.

“Fucking snap out of it!” He screamed. “What the fuck, dude, you’re freaking me out! Stop it, now!”

Having all of my senses come collapsing back on me at once, I tried to answer him.

“What do you mean? I… I had told you to stop before you hit that guy and then… and then…” I couldn’t finish my sentence. I knew I had warned Rob about the man on the road, but the encounter I had after that felt like a strange blur.

“Yeah, I heard you and there wasn’t anyone there, dude.” He responded. “You just fell back in the seat with your eyes wide open, staring at the road… You freaked me the fuck out dude, I thought you were dying or something.”

Rob’s anger had transformed into worry as he sat back in his seat, breathing heavily.

“What the fuck was that?” He asked, “What did you see?”

I sat back, trying to gather my thoughts. I wasn’t exactly sure what I had seen… and I didn’t know how to explain it to Rob.

“Let’s…Let’s just get home and I’ll explain it,” I said, looking over at Rob, still wrapped in confusion.

The rest of the short drive home was made in silence. I had scared Rob so badly that he didn’t even want to speak to me. We pulled into the driveway and came to a stop. Rob parked the car, sitting still in his seat for a moment.

“What was that, man… seriously?” He asked, looking at me with deep concern.

“I… I don’t know. I just saw that guy standing in the road.” I replied, “I tried to warn you and then… and then it all just went… black.”

I searched my mind for a suitable explanation, yet none of what I thought made any sense.

“I guess I had a weird hallucination or something.” I told him, “I think I just need to get some sleep.”

Rob sat with a fearfully perplexed look on his face, as if I had just told him a ghost story. His eyes softened as he let out a deep sigh.

“Dude… please don’t do that shit again… you almost gave me a heart attack.”

I gave him a half-smile and nodded before stepping out of the car and heading inside.

Rob and I didn’t talk about the incident much. I didn’t want to bring it up again either. There was something so… unsettlingly strange about it. I can’t explain it, but… I felt connected to the man… Like he knew me in some way. It sounds insane, but it’s true. The night after what Rob labeled ‘The Attack’ was filled with visions of the man swirling around my mind as I slept. I couldn’t shake his stare… his white, glowing eyes imprisoning me inside my own body.

The next morning, Rob left for a trip with some friends. He would be gone for a week, leaving me alone with the house while he was gone.

“You gonna be ok here alone?” He asked.

“Yeah, I’m good, man,” I responded, trying to reassure him. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll go get checked out if I need to.”

He gave me a concerned look as he turned to put his bag in his car.

“I’ll be back in a week.” He said, “Please, don’t burn my house down.”

“I won’t, dude,” I assured him. “Go have a good time, I’ll hopefully have a job and be looking for a place of my own by the time you get back.”

Rob shot me a smile and slumped into the driver’s seat of his car. As I watched him pull away, my eyes immediately wandered up the road. Amid the mundane Sunday rituals performed by the neighbors, a person in black stood motionless. Squinting my eyes, I could see that it was a man… a man in a black coat… now about a block closer than he had been.

My heart dropped the instant I saw him. As always, he was standing in the middle of the road, cloaked in black, staring straight at me. Rob’s car had just turned the corner, rolling smoothly onto the street. Coming up to speed, he was now barreling straight for the man. My eyes darted between the two… the distance between them growing smaller by the second. I wanted to shout, but deep down, something told me that he couldn’t see him… that he wasn’t supposed to. Rob didn’t slow… He didn’t swerve. I winced, clenching my teeth as the car struck the man’s legs. There was no sound… no impact. The vehicle moved right through him as if he were made of smoke. The man’s figure swirled and trembled from the car’s intrusion before settling back into shape. And still, the man never looked away from me… not once. The car cut through his form like he wasn’t ever real. Yet, there he stood… motionless and unharmed.

As Rob’s car disappeared over the hill in the distance, I locked eyes with the man in black. His stare seemed to envelope me… sending an icy chill up my legs and into my chest. I felt fear gripping my heart as I stared into his pearly white eyes. The seconds passed like hours… each one feeling like its own eternal prison, forever locking me into a staring contest with what felt like evil. He just stood there… staring. For some reason, no matter how hard I tried, I could not break my gaze. It felt like he wanted me to look… he wanted my attention.

My eyes began to tire and burn. I was finally able to blink… a split second of blackness that felt like pure bliss cascaded across my vision. I dreaded the return from blackness… I feared that the man would still be there… closer this time. As my eyes opened, I no longer felt the magnetic pull of his gaze. He had disappeared as he had done many times before. Confusion and fear washed over me as I staggered inside. This visit had scared me more than ever before.

“How can he control me like that?” I asked myself.

I felt so scared and uncomfortable when I saw him, and yet, I could do nothing about it. My body involuntarily put itself into a trance-like state... commanding every fiber of my being to never take my eyes off of his.

That night, I researched cases of hallucinations in people who had traumatic experiences. One particular article caught my eye… it read:

‘Seeing and/or hearing people who are not physically present can be a sign of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and should be taken seriously. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, talk to your doctor immediately.’

This was it. The article explained exactly what I had been dealing with. I really didn’t want to see a doctor, but if it meant getting rid of my strange stalker… I would do anything.

I called the local ‘doc in a box’ the next morning and set up an appointment. I didn’t see the man when I left, but then again, I wasn’t actively looking for him. He always appeared when it seemed like I was not paying attention or looking elsewhere. In my mind, I told myself that if I didn’t think about him, he wouldn’t appear. I arrived at the doctor’s office and went in for my appointment. Surprisingly, I was brought back fairly quickly. Usually, these places take hours for a nurse to take you to a room. The doctor walked in holding a clipboard, thumbing through the pages. In one fluid motion, he walked in, closed the door, and squatted down onto a rolling stool.

I watched him rifle through the pages on his clipboard for a few more seconds before he looked up at me.

“So… uhh,” He said, looking briefly back at his clipboard. “Your name is Silas, right?”

His white mustache ruffled across his lips as he spoke, his mouth movements barely perceptible.

“Yes… That’s right.” I replied.

He looked me up and down once more, laying the clipboard on the counter next to him and folding his arms across his chest.

“So… What brings you in today, Silas?” He asked.

“Well… I’ve been seeing things.” I muttered. “Things that feel… real. But I’m not sure if they are.”

The doctor raised his eyebrows in surprise, looking at me more intently.

“Can you explain what you see?” He asked. “For example, are these things… people… or maybe objects? And how often do you see them?”

“It’s only one person that I see…” I responded. “It’s the same man every time… I usually see him once a day.”

I paused, squirming uncomfortably. The words felt so foreign coming from my mouth.

“I haven’t seen him today, though.”

The doctor leaned back a bit, unfolding his arms and stroking his mustache with his fingers. His eyebrows furrowed in concentration.

“Hmmm… interesting.” He said, voice low. “When did you start seeing this man? Is he familiar, or maybe someone you know?”

“A few days ago,” I answered. “I started seeing him the night I got kicked out of my parents' house… and no, I don’t know him… he just shows up at random times… staring at me.”

I looked down, pausing for a moment as my brain relived the experience I had with the man the day prior.

“It feels like I can’t stop staring at him... like he won’t let me,” I said in a melancholic tone. “I see him every day, just standing in the middle of the street wearing all black. Over the past few days, he has been getting closer and closer… like he is stalking me.”

As soon as I finished my explanation, his eyebrows lifted… a smile finding his face.

“Ahh… that’s it.” He said confidently. “The traumatic experience you suffered with your parents probably caused your brain to retaliate.”

He sat up straight, raising his hands to help gesture what he was saying.

“Sometimes the brain takes past trauma in our lives and turns them into people or objects that seem so real that you would swear they were in the same room with you.” He said, continuing his explanation. “It’s all just your brain’s way of dealing with the pain… making sense of it.”

He looked at me as if I understood him… waiting for me to say something in response. The uncomfortable silence seemed to last a little too long for his liking as he stood up from his stool.

“You understand what I’m saying?” He asked.

“Uhh… Yeah, I think so.” I replied. “You’re saying it’s all in my head… Right?”

The doctor smiled as if he had made a breakthrough.

“Exactly! See, you get it!” He said in an upbeat tone. “I’m going to prescribe you some medication that will help you deal with these hallucinations.”

He grabbed his clipboard and started scribbling on one of the pages.

“Now, this is not a long-term fix. You’ll need to see your primary physician if you want to continue this treatment, but I can provide you with a week’s supply for now.” He said, scratching the pen across the page.

The doctor handed me a piece of paper with what looked like chicken scratch scribbled on it and ushered me back toward the main lobby.

“You take care now, Silas.” He said joyfully. “Hopefully, that takes care of your mystery man.”

He smiled at me and turned away, disappearing into another exam room. I walked over to the pharmacy counter and gave the pharmacist the paper. She took it and walked to the back, grabbing a small, white bottle. She put the bottle in a paper bag and stapled it closed with the doctor’s paper.

“Here you go, hon.” She said with a sweet voice. “That’ll be ten dollars.”

I paid the woman and headed out to my car. I pulled the bottle out of the bag and read the label. It was mainly a wall of text, including warnings about not operating heavy machinery or vehicles while taking it. I didn’t care. I’d probably end up crashing my car anyway if I saw the man on the way home… pills or no pills. I popped the top off the container and swallowed a couple, hoping that the effects would kick in soon.

I was driving back to Rob’s house after leaving the doctor’s office, when all of a sudden I felt a heavy weight settle across my forehead… like someone had hung a ten-pound dumbbell between my eyes. My eyes started to droop, and my head began falling lower and lower as the feeling intensified.

“What the fuck is in those pills?” I asked myself as I struggled to keep control of the car, swerving back and forth across the road.

My head bobbed up and down as I fought the effects. By the time I made it back to Rob’s house, I had reduced my speed so much that I could’ve walked on foot and made it there faster. I was able to maneuver the car into the driveway and put it in park. I stumbled out of the car into the house, barely making it to the couch before I completely passed out.

For the first time in a long time, I was able to get restful sleep. I ended up crashing onto the couch at 3 pm and ended up waking at 5 am the next morning. I opened my eyes, lifting my head out of the puddle of drool that had collected underneath it. Looking around the room, I was confused as to why the sun was rising when I had just seen it setting.

“Jesus… That shit knocked me out.” I said, wiping my eyes.

My mind was clearer than it had been. The angry thoughts I had about my parents were now gone… along with the thoughts I had about suicide. For what it was worth, I felt great. I wasn’t in the best of situations, but my mind was finally starting to feel safe.

A couple of hours after I woke up, I got to work. Now that I could focus on more than just sadness and anger, I cleaned Rob’s entire house. I felt reinvigorated and full of energy. The thought of the strange man had not crossed my mind, nor had the idea that he might still be out there. A few hours passed, and now that I was finished with cleaning, I thought I’d call the bottling plant to ask if they had reviewed my application.

“Priceville Bottling Facility, my name is Sandra. How may I help you?” The voice on the other end of the phone answered.

“Uh, yes, I wanted to check on my application with you guys,” I said in return. “I faxed it in a couple of days ago and just wanted to check on the status of that, please.”

I heard papers rustling and crumpling across the phone for a few seconds before she responded.

“Ahh, here we go. Your name is Silas, right?” She asked.

“Yes, ma’am, that’s me,” I replied.

“Looks like the manager has marked the application for an interview. He had planned to call you tomorrow to set up a time that works best for you, but we can go ahead and do that now if you would like.”

My heart jumped in my chest… excitement flooded my body. I was so happy to hear those words. I had wanted for so long to belong somewhere… to be a part of something.

“Erm…Y…Yes, I would like to set it up now.” I stammered, answering the woman.

“Ok, great! When would you like to come in?” She asked. “It looks like he has availability tomorrow morning around 10 am or Friday afternoon around 2 pm.”

“I can come in tomorrow morning,” I responded quickly.

“Tomorrow morning it is. Thank you for calling, Silas. See you tomorrow.” She said in a soft and gleeful tone.

As I hung up the phone, joy overtook my senses. I was finally pulling my life back together… slowly but surely. I was proud of how far I’d come. It was only a matter of time before I had a place to call my own. I spent the rest of the day riding the high from the phone call. I found myself smiling for the first time in weeks. For once, I felt like I could enjoy true peace.

That night was so different from the usual that I almost thought I had taken over someone else’s life. By taking those pills, I had set myself free. All of my worries seemed to be torn away by a small, white pill. Right before bed, I took another dose of the medication… only one this time, as the label had recommended. I figured I needed to dial it back a bit so as not to fall completely comatose again. I now had something to look forward to with that interview. I couldn’t afford to sleep for another fourteen hours. I lay down in bed and pulled the blanket across my chest. As I looked up at the blank ceiling, a smile wormed its way across my lips, letting my mind roam free. There was no man in black nor any feelings of dread… There was just silence. I felt the effects of the pill start to kick in as I drifted into a deep, restful sleep.

The morning after my visit with the doctor was… different. It was like the air in the room had gotten heavy, pressing its weight down on me. I sat up and glanced around the room. It looked the same as I remembered, but it felt off… like someone else had been inside watching me sleep. I tried to push it to the back of my mind as I stretched my arms and yawned, shaking off the remnants of sleep. I got up and walked to the kitchen to start my morning coffee. My interview was in a couple of hours, and I wanted to be sharp. It was a job that paid barely above minimum wage, but it was a job, nonetheless. It was the next rung on the ladder of life that I had to climb to reach the heights I wanted for myself.

The coffee machine gurgled to life, pouring forth the sweet essence that kept me going. I leaned against the counter, listening to the comforting whir and letting my mind drift into my newfound happiness. I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath.

“It’s going to be a good day,” I told myself.

I opened my eyes as the coffee machine came to a stop. As I watched the last couple of drips fall into the pot, my mind started to drift again. Something was grabbing me, like a child pulling on my sleeve, begging for attention. I scanned the room, looking for anything out of place. As I turned back toward the front door, I saw something strange that I hadn’t noticed. The living room curtains were open.

I never left the curtains open… ever. I had a quiet superstition that if I didn’t leave the curtains open, then I wouldn’t see him… and he couldn’t see me. I treated the thin fabric like a shield that protected me from the ‘hallucination’ that I was desperately trying to medicate away. I walked over to the window, doing my best not to look out as I pulled them closed. I held them in my grasp for a moment, curiosity gripping me. Deep within my subconscious, I actually believed the medication had gotten rid of the man, and yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that he might still be out there.

“What if… he’s still there?” I asked myself in my mind.

The curiosity gnawed at me… I had to make sure. I slowly pulled the curtains apart, keeping my head turned away. Slowly, the curtains peeled away, as if I were pulling a band-aid off of a festering wound… fearful of what I would see underneath. I slowly turned my head to look outside. My heart was pounding… fear overcoming me. I didn’t want to look… but I had to. I had to see if he was there.

I expected the worst as I peeked through the window… my eyes darting down to the sidewalk immediately. I slowly rolled my eyes upward until the driveway came into view… and then the mailbox… and the street. The entire neighborhood was now in view. To my relief, there was nobody to be seen. All I could see outside was a quiet street, still waking up from its slumber. I examined all the small details of the view, finally calming myself down. I looked up the street. The pavement was wet from a recent rain. I had slept so deeply that I had not heard the rain come through… a testament to how well the medication had worked. The only anomaly I could find was a plastic bag stuck in a bush by the front yard, being tugged gently by the wind. I exhaled slowly and let out a nervous chuckle.

“Just my imagination,” I muttered, trying to convince myself that he was really gone.

I shook it off, easily letting it fade away from my mind… another perk of the medication’s effects. I drew the curtains closed once more, chalking the occurrence up to just a bout of forgetfulness on my part. I made my way back into the bedroom and got dressed, putting on the only button-up shirt I owned and a pair of my dad’s old khakis. I had to borrow one of Rob’s belts. Mine had broken a couple of weeks earlier. I looked… decent. I wasn’t going to win any awards, but I was ready and willing to start my new life. I grabbed my keys, hopped in the car, and headed toward the bottling plant for the interview.

The plant was about a twenty-minute drive from Rob’s house. I arrived early and waited in the car for a bit, sipping the last of the lukewarm coffee I’d brought with me. I went over what I would say in my mind. The nervousness crawled over me, fogging over my prepared lines. I looked at my watch… it was time to head inside. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

“You got this,” I told myself as I exited the car and headed towards the lobby door.

The interview itself went better than expected. The manager was a burly man named Hank who had been working there for over fifteen years. His face was weathered… full of wrinkles and laugh lines. When he smiled, his face curled into what I can only describe as a top-down view of a topographical map… ridges and valleys swirling through his skin. He seemed genuinely pleased as we wrapped up.

“I think you’ll fit in just fine here, Silas.” He said, sticking his hand out toward me.

I shook his hand, his rough calluses scratching my skin. I almost winced from how strong his grip was.

“We’ll give you a call tonight or tomorrow morning,” he said with a nod. “But it’s lookin’ good, Silas.”

I thanked him and walked out… feeling like I had just won the lottery.

Land of sardines, surf, and a sun that refuses to quit. But here’s the real kicker: it’s become the promised land for digital nomads. Not just because the coffee is strong enough to wake the dead, but because this country gets it. They’ve built a playground for the restless, the ambitious, the unchained. Forget the old rules. Portugal’s rewriting them.

***🚀 Curious about your nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

The digital nomad scene here isn’t just tolerated. It’s celebrated. Picture this: rooftop coworking in Lisbon, sunset laptops in Lagos, and a community that’s allergic to mediocrity. Portugal’s not just a destination. It’s a movement.

**The Digital Nomad Visa: A Passport to Freedom**

Let’s cut through the noise. A digital nomad visa is your golden ticket—legal permission to live and work (remotely) in a country that doesn’t want you chained to a desk. Portugal’s version? It’s a middle finger to the old world, a wink to the future. No more border runs. No more living in the shadows.

***🌍 Ready to unleash your digital nomad income? [Find out now—click here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

This visa isn’t just paperwork. It’s a manifesto. It says: bring your hustle, your ambition, your laptop, and your dreams. Portugal wants you.

**Portugal’s Digital Nomad Visa: The Nitty-Gritty**

Let’s get surgical. The official name? “D7 Visa” for passive income, but the real star is the “Digital Nomad Visa” (technically, the Temporary Stay or Residence Visa for Remote Workers). Born from a government that saw the remote revolution and didn’t blink. They wanted the world’s untethered talent. So they built a legal on-ramp.

Who’s behind it? Lawmakers with vision. Bureaucrats who finally got tired of paperwork for paperwork’s sake. The goal: attract high-earning, low-impact global citizens.

**Eligibility: Who Gets to Play?**

Not everyone gets a seat at this table. You need remote income—think clients, contracts, or a boss who doesn’t care where you Zoom from. The magic number? Around €2,800 per month, but don’t trust the rumor mill. Portugal wants proof you’re not going to be a burden. If you’re from the EU, you’re already in. From elsewhere? Time to show your credentials.

***🔥 Want to know if your income qualifies? [Test your nomad potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

Some nationalities get the velvet rope. Others? Sorry, not tonight. But the list is long and inclusive—if you’re not on a sanctions list, you’re probably golden.

**The Application Process: Bureaucracy, But Make It Sexy**

Yes, there’s paperwork. But Portugal’s made it less soul-crushing. Gather your documents: proof of income, remote work contract, criminal record check, health insurance, and a Portuguese address. No, you don’t need to sell your soul. Just prove you exist and you’re solvent.

Apply at your local consulate or online. No secret handshakes, but a good lawyer never hurts. Just keep your wits and your patience.

**Proof of Income: Show Me the Money**

Portugal wants receipts. Remote work is king—salaries, freelance gigs, or business income. Passive income works if it’s steady. Bank statements, contracts, and invoices are your new best friends. If your income’s a little “creative,” get creative with your documentation. But don’t lie—they will check.

***💡 Ready to break free? [Check your digital nomad income instantly!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

Crypto counts, but only if you can prove it’s real and stable. No, your NFT collection doesn’t count. Yet.

**Health Insurance: Because Accidents Happen**

You need health insurance that covers you in Portugal. Not just travel insurance—a policy that actually pays out when you break your leg surfing Nazaré. Minimum coverage requirements apply. Don’t cheap out. The consulate will see through it.

Pro tip: Get a policy from an international provider. Local ones are great, but harder to secure before you arrive.

**Housing: The Portuguese Address Dilemma**

You need an address. Lease, Airbnb, or a friend’s flat. Portugal doesn’t care, as long as it’s legit. Landlords know the game, and some offer “visa-friendly” leases. Don’t get scammed—always get a contract.

If you’re still couch surfing, consider a short-term rental with a contract. It’s the easiest way to tick the box.

***🌐 Wondering if your lifestyle fits? [Discover your nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Visa Fees: The Cost of Liberation**

Freedom isn’t free. Expect to pay a few hundred euros in application and processing fees. Add in document translations, notary stamps, and the odd “expedite” fee if you’re in a hurry. Budget for the unexpected—bureaucracy loves a surprise.

Don’t forget: you’ll need proof of funds for your stay. Keep a cushion.

**Timeline: From Dream to Departure**

How long does it take? Officially, a few weeks. In reality, it depends on your paperwork, your consulate, and the mood of the clerk. Some get approved in a month. Others wait three. Start early, breathe deep.

Expedite if you can, but don’t bank on miracles. Portugal moves at its own pace.

**Living in Portugal: The Sweet, the Salty, the Surreal**

Cost of living? Cheaper than Paris, pricier than Bali. Lisbon and Porto are the hotspots, but don’t sleep on Madeira or the Algarve. Rent, food, and transport are reasonable. Coffee is practically a human right.

Lisbon is the digital nomad capital. Porto is the rebel cousin. Madeira’s an island utopia. Choose your flavor.

***🚀 Ready to see if Portugal is your next move? [Diagnose your nomad income in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Taxes: The Elephant in the Room**

Will Portugal tax your global income? Maybe. The Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) regime offers sweet tax breaks for the first ten years. But read the fine print. You might still owe tax in your home country.

Get a tax advisor. The rules are a labyrinth, but the rewards are real.

**Community: Find Your Tribe**

Digital nomads flock together. Coworking spaces are everywhere—some with ocean views, others with espresso on tap. Meetups, masterminds, and Slack groups abound. Find your people. They’ll save your sanity.

Online communities are gold. Skip the spammy Facebook groups—look for curated, invite-only circles.

**Internet and Infrastructure: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly**

Wi-Fi is fast and reliable in cities. Rural areas? Bring a hotspot. SIM cards are cheap, data is plentiful. Backup plans are a must—outages happen, even in paradise.

Coworking spaces rarely disappoint. Cafés are laptop-friendly, but mind the lunchtime rush.

***🌍 Want to know if you can thrive as a digital nomad? [Check your income potential here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Culture Shock: Embracing the Portuguese Way**

Portuguese is the language, but English gets you far. Learn a few key phrases—it opens doors. The pace is slower. Bureaucracy is an art form. Embrace the chaos.

Respect local customs. The Portuguese are warm, but reserved. Don’t mistake politeness for indifference.

**Family and Partners: Can You Bring Your Crew?**

Yes, you can bring your family. Dependent visas are available, but require extra paperwork. Kids? Schools are solid, international options exist. Childcare is affordable.

Partners need their own visa if not married. Plan ahead.

**Renewal and Extensions: Staying Longer Without Drama**

The visa lasts up to a year, renewable. Start the process early. Overstaying is a bad idea—fines, bans, and headaches await. Keep your documents updated.

Extensions are straightforward if you follow the rules.

***🔥 Curious if your income is enough for Portugal? [Test your nomad potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Pitfalls and Power Moves: What Nobody Tells You**

Watch for scams—fake landlords, bogus insurance. Double-check every document. Don’t trust everything you read online. The best advice comes from those who’ve done it.

Insider hack: Use a relocation agency if you’re overwhelmed. Worth every euro.

**Alternatives: If the Digital Nomad Visa Isn’t Your Jam**

Portugal offers other visas: D7 for passive income, Golden Visa for investors, Startup Visa for entrepreneurs. The EU has options too. Don’t force a square peg into a round hole.

Explore your options. There’s more than one way to hack the system.

**The Future of Digital Nomadism in Portugal**

Portugal’s just getting started. More perks, more flexibility, more innovation on the horizon. The government listens to nomads—expect tweaks, upgrades, and maybe even a digital nomad utopia.

Stay tuned. The revolution is only beginning.",1,1751380951.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

Hi! I'm a **fresh grad on my first job** ***(officially working for 3 months on July 22)***, and I have a strange dilemma. 

**FOR CONTEXT:**

When I was getting ready to sign my contract for this job, I didn't have anything set up. I was being absorbed from my internship, and I only had GCash to my name. 

So syempre, need nila ng bank account number-- ayokong humingi ng pang maintaining balance sa parents ko for BDO, so ekis muna. Nirecommend sakin ng coworker ko yung Unionbank kasi mabilis daw application, pero after 3 days of rejections (skill issue), I ended up opening a Seabank and a GoTyme account (out of stress and impulse) para makapagset-up na at makasweldo. On the fourth day of trying, naapprove yung Unionbank account ko. Then I got my first paycheck, I opened a BDO account with it para direct deposit nalang, since BDO and BPI lang supported ng company. In the end, bumalik din ako sa BDO lmao

Now I have all these banks na di ko nayu-utilize lahat fully, haha. Currently, I only use BDO to house my salary. Nagwi-withdraw din ako from my ATM para sa pamasahe. I move money to my Seabank account for EF, GoTyme for long-term saving goals (new phone), GCash for load, spotify subscriptions, and Angkas/Moveit/Joyride/Grab. 

The initial plan was to use Unionbank as a [payslip](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1das7z3/comment/l7mj94x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), pero I don't actually know what that means and how to use it that way. Recently, I've been using it to pay for coffee and games as well as in-game purchases kasi minsan sinasabihan ako ni UB na hindi nakaindicate yung mobile number ko for online transactions.  

  
**My question is**: may maa-advice ba kayo for this newly-indoctrinated corporate slave? Gusto ko sana malaman if I can drop a bank or wallet or two or if magagamit ko pa rin naman lahat somehow for different purposes and need lang ng crash course to optimize my bank usage.

I’m feeling so overwhelmed right now and just need some advice or comfort.

I have a little 12-year-old chihuahua mix who hasn’t been acting like himself since June 29th. The incident that may have caused it happened when my mom (who lives with me) was locked out of the house while taking him out. To get back in, she had to climb through a window and placed my dog on a coffee table (maybe 1–1.5 ft high) so she could use both hands to get in. While she was climbing in, he jumped off the table. I’m so protective over him so this really upsets me, but I understand she couldn’t stop him in that moment. 

Since then, he’s been acting differently. He walks okay as he can, so I don’t think it’s his legs. But I’m worried it might be his neck as he appears to be he’s holding his head lower than usual, reluctant to shake off, and sometimes yelps when touched near the neck/head. He also seems to be guarding the area. It absolutely breaks my heart. He sleeps in my bed, usually between my legs on top of the covers, and now if I shift too much in the night, he yelps like I’ve hurt him. He absolutely refuses to sleep anywhere else, but I feel awful and don’t want to hurt him further.

He’s still eating and drinking, but he seems uncomfortable and occasionally shakes like he’s in pain.
I haven’t been able to eat or focus because I’m so upset. I feel like a terrible owner because I haven’t been able to get him to the vet yet. The earliest I can afford to take him is July 4th, when our local vet is open for urgent care. That feels so far away and I’m scared I’m doing damage by waiting.

Is it terrible that I have to wait until then? Is there anything I can do in the meantime to make him more comfortable while we wait?

Any advice or even just words would really mean a lot right now. I love him so much and I’m trying my best, but I feel like I’m failing him. Waiting feels so terrible because by then, it would be almost a week of him suffering. Just feeling awful and sort of spiraling right now.

# CHAPTER TWO

BREWING IN SILENCE

  **Legends never die**—Dad told me once. “They may perish physically, but they will forever carry on within us, motivating us to keep their legacy alive. We must make their fight worth it.”

  I sit in the rocking chair across from him, my legs are barely long enough to reach the floor if I lean back.

  “How does a person create a legacy?” I ask him, my voice still infused by youthful innocence.

  “People who have a legacy have paid a price that not many people are willing to pay, no matter the outcome. They have a fire burning within them that is kindled only when the time is right,” he says, his steel-blue eyes locked into mine.

  *That hits hard.*

  “Lainey!” I hear Dad’s voice from the hall. “We have to leave here in a few minutes.”

  I jolt in my desk chair, his voice piercing through the silence. I take a sip of coffee—cold.

  Great. How long have I been sitting here?

  I force myself to swallow and start lacing my boots up and grabbing a green jacket out of the closet before Dad realizes I’ve been sitting around.

  I tie my hair up in a low ponytail, some pieces draping to the side of my face.

  “I’m ready. Sorry, it took a few more minutes,” I sigh, rushing to the kitchen to refill my thermos with coffee.

  “The truck’s warming up, your lunch is already packed, oh, and make sure to take a coat just in case the weather acts up.”

  “Okay, thanks.”

  I step out of the front door, the warm porch light gently illuminating the entrance. Moths frantically fly around the light, casting monstrous shadows on the wall. The sky is a calming gradient of deep blue, purple, and dark pink.

  I pause, standing at the edge of the porch, and take a few deep breaths, watching it float out in front of me in silver clouds slowly dissipating after a few seconds.

  Another day, alive and healthy. I have the privilege of seeing the sun rise and set.

  I step into his white 2001 Chevrolet Silverado. The dashboard is lit in green and blue lights, and the heater is at full blast. The interior lights emphasize the sun-bleached streaks in Dad’s hair.

  He takes a sip of coffee from his thermos with the “don’t tread on me” flag engraved into the steel. I got it for him last Christmas. I knew it would be a perfect gift. He puts the truck in gear and starts driving.

  We live 25 minutes outside of Knoxville, about 30 minutes from Ginham High School—where I attend Junior year. Sometimes I wonder if we’re far enough away.

  I wrap my fingers around my thermos, warming my hands. The tail lights from the cars ahead reflect in Dad’s eyes.

  “What had you up so early?” he asks, in his charming Texas accent, glancing over at me and then back at the road.

  “I don’t know,” I say, staring a bit too long at my coffee. “Had a bad dream, and decided to stay up, I guess.”

  “Why were you looking at the news?” he asks, concerned.

  *Oh no, he is in the ‘interrogating’ mood.*

  I look out the window for a second, letting my mind take a breath before answering. “Just staying in reality.”

  I finally release myself, “I don’t know, Dad. Maybe I’m paranoid, but I—I just have this gut feeling that everything is not just ‘*for your safety,*’” I air quote, shaking my head, looking out the window, fogged at the bottom from the contrast of temperatures.

  “Yeah—I know,” he says with a sigh, looking in the rearview mirror before changing lanes.

  *Does he?*

  He pulls up in front of the entrance gate of my High School. The school entrance has a brick wall connected to both sides that stretches for about 30 feet on each side, with a large sign that reads, “Ginham High School.”

  All the kids are walking into the entrance gate, many with their hoods covering their heads, avoiding the freezing wind.

  I look around as far as possible while still sitting in the passenger seat. The angle of the brick wall inhibits my view. I catch a glimpse of kids standing next to each other, lined up.

  “What is the line of kids about, do you know?” he asks, looking over the dashboard.

  “I don’t know, probably just screening stuff, making sure everyone is accounted for. School has been out for the last month.” I say, dissolving the tension in him.

  “Love ya, Dad,” I say, stepping out.

  “Love you too, sweetheart,” he says, his thumbs fiddling over the steering wheel.

  “Lainey!” Dad calls me back.

  “Yes?” I say, walking back and leaning my arms over the windowsill.

  “Be careful, honey. There are a lot of interesting things going on lately. Watch your six,” he commands, in a low voice, caring but deliberate.

  “I will. I brought my pocket knife just in case.” I smile, turning to him, showing the green knife clipped to the side of my jeans. It is under my hoodie and jacket, so nobody gets suspicious.

\*\*\*

  I walk in with the rest of the kids, and the gate closes behind us. There’s a long line standing outside waiting to get into the school. Three at a time, they go through each door. I see a group go in and then look at my watch. Every 5 minutes, they let a group in.

  What are they doing?

  I stand in the long line, with my hoodie over my head, hugging my green jacket closer to me.

  A boy is standing in front of me, and I gently tap his shoulder, and he turns towards me.

  “What do you want?”

  “I’m sorry, but do you have any idea what all of this is about?” I point toward the lines of students adjacent to us.

  “No, I don’t, but I was wonderin’ the same thing.” he pauses, “probably has something to do with this virus goin’ around.”

  “Yeah, maybe,” I look back over towards the lines.

  Now it was our turn. Someone in a lab coat is standing near the entrance next to this white box on the doorframe.

  “Name, please,” the woman in the lab coat says, holding a clipboard in her hands.

  “Joshua Crenshaw.”

  “Kimberly Bryant.”

  I step forward, my arms crossed.

  “Name?” she asks, looking up from the clipboard.

  “Umm, why do you need that?” I ask, tightening my jacket around myself even tighter, exposing my slim waist.

  “Just policy. Now, I need it, or we will have to escort you off school property.”

  I look at her ID card hanging from her neck, the letters are too small to read, but I see the CDC logo.

  *Something’s not right.*

  “Marie Wilders,” I say, glancing up at her.

  *I just went by an alias. Will I get in trouble for that? Will they find out?*

  I glance over my shoulder.

  “Go to the second room on the right.”

  “Next!” she yells.

  I hear her asking the same question to the others.

  I step forward when a blinding red laser shines on me, as fast as the blink of an eye, leaving spots floating around in my vision for a few seconds. I stand there, stepping sideways, blinking a few times. It came from the small white box on the door frame.

  *What in the world was that?*

  “Hey!” I yell, raising my hand, my voice a little raspy, “What’s that?”

  “It takes your temperature, I think,” the boy walking next to me says.

  “I wish they could do it in a less *invasive* way,” I murmur under my breath as I keep walking.

  “Yeah,” he giggles. “Nothin’ to worry about though, they just want to make sure we’re all healthy.”

  That word, ‘they’, is not usually a good sign to me.

  I continue, heading towards the room the woman told me to go into. I walk in, peeking around the door before opening all the way.

  There is a stainless steel table in the center against the wall, a rolling chair next to it, and a wooden chair in the corner.

  A laminated poster is nailed to the wall that reads, “**The doctor will be in soon, please wait**.”

  *Doctor on the school campus? They already took our temperature.*

  There is a fluorescent lighting panel in the drop-down ceiling, which is a little dimmer than *normal* clinical rooms.

  I sit in the wooden chair in the corner, the wood still warm from the last person sitting there. That steel table makes me cringe, too much deja vu from my dream.

  I slip my hood back and try to relax when I notice a small camera in the corner with a red dot slowly blinking near the lens. I can’t help but wonder if anybody is watching through it.

  “I don’t know what this is all about, but I know it runs deeper,” I say to the camera, looking straight into the lens.

  The door creaks open, and a man in a lab coat steps through. He is tall, with sandy blonde hair and icy blue eyes. The light from above accentuates his deep forehead wrinkles.

  “Hello, Miss Wilders,” he says, sitting down on the rolling chair.

  *Miss Wilders.* My hands slightly tremble when I hear my alias name. 

  “Hello, doctor. Why am I here, and why are you here?” I say with no expression, looking him straight in the eyes.

  Something about the way he carries himself is not normal.

  “Before I answer your questions, I have some questions that I need you to answer. Some will seem irrelevant to the situation, but are, regardless, important information for the conditions the world is in,” he says, his voice getting colder by the minute.

  I nod and glance down for a second, swallowing the lump in my throat.

  “How many people do you live with, Miss Ledger?”

  Why do you need to know that?

  My stomach drops, and my throat tightens into a knot.

  Miss Ledger?

  “J-just me and my dad.”

  He looks down, filling in information on a piece of paper.

  “Do you own any guns? If so, how many and what kind?”

  I stare at him for a second, “Uhh–I don’t know if we do or not.”

  “Yes or no. It is a simple question.”

  “Yes,” I exhale sharply.

  “How many? What kind?”

  I start to get up and head towards the door, “These questions are making me un–uncomfortable. So if you would carry on with the next kid, I will just excuse my–”

  He interrupts me, grabbing my wrist so tightly, I’m sure I will have a bruise. “I’m not done with you yet. I need you to answer these questions, or I will have you reported.”

  I rip my wrist away and search his eyes, “Who do you think you are?” My voice slightly trembles.

  I sit back down in the chair quietly. I don’t know what else to do.

  “How many guns do you have? What type?” he excentuates each word.

  “You know what? I will ask you the questions after,” he exhales, frustrated.

  *After what?*

  He steps over to a jar with latex gloves and slips them on his hands.

  There is a vial of liquid on the counter. He reaches for it, suctioning it into a needle syringe, then sets it down.

  “I will be right back. Stay here.”

  He walks out of the room. I jolt at the slam of the door behind him. Then I hear it—the click of the lock.

  I get up and try turning the knob. It is frozen in place.",1,1751380781.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

Note, most seniors can make their own decisions on their level of exercise, nutrition or food choices, if in doubt, reach out to your doctor or do some research online.  You control your destiny but use common sense as well. 

https://preview.redd.it/yrea7yuex9af1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c66a08214ae7b792122f3a489968d1950c263971

As we age, maintaining strength, stability, and bone health becomes crucial not only for survival, but for thriving—staying active, independent, and enjoying life to the fullest. Emerging evidence highlights two powerful tools: jumping exercises and optimized nutrition. Here’s how each can make a difference, and why combining them is especially effective.

# The Power of Jumping: More Than Just Play

Recent research has shown that even light hopping or jump rope exercises, performed safely, can have profound benefits for bone density and strength. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials found that jump training significantly improves bone mineral density, particularly in the femoral neck—the part of the hip most vulnerable to fractures in older adults. Another study demonstrated that just two minutes of hopping per day led to increases in hip bone density of up to 7% in older men, with the most significant improvements seen in the thinnest, most at-risk areas of bone. These exercises not only strengthen bones but also enhance balance and coordination, reducing the risk of falls and fractures.

Jumping exercises are a form of weight-bearing activity, which is essential for stimulating bone growth and remodeling. The repeated impact from hopping or jumping activates bone-forming cells, promoting new bone formation and improving bone strength. While high-impact jumping may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with advanced osteoporosis, modified or low-impact versions—such as gentle hops or using a mini-trampoline—can provide similar benefits with less risk.

# Nutrition: The Foundation for Strength and Recovery

To maximize the benefits of jumping and other exercises, targeted nutrition is essential. Three key supplements stand out for seniors aiming to preserve muscle and bone health:

1. **Creatine:** Extensive research shows that creatine supplementation, when combined with resistance training, increases lean muscle mass, strength, and functional performance in older adults. Creatine also supports muscle recovery and may help reduce the risk of falls by improving lower-body strength.
2. **Protein:** Adequate protein intake—ideally 1.2–1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day—supports muscle protein synthesis and helps prevent sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass. Higher protein intake is associated with better physical function and a lower risk of disability in older adults.
3. **Vitamin D:** This vitamin is crucial for bone health and muscle function. Many seniors are deficient, and supplementation can improve bone density, muscle strength, and balance, reducing the risk of falls and fractures.

# Combining Jumping and Nutrition: The Path to Thriving

The synergy between jumping exercises and targeted nutrition is clear. Jumping provides the mechanical stress needed to stimulate bone growth, while creatine, protein, and vitamin D support muscle and bone health from within. Together, these strategies help older adults not only maintain but improve their strength, stability, and overall quality of life.

For those interested in a low-carb approach, recent studies have shown that a ketogenic diet can also help preserve muscle mass and function in aging animals, though more research is needed in humans. However, the combination of adequate protein, creatine, and vitamin D remains the most evidence-based approach for seniors.

# Practical Tips for Getting Started

* **Start Slow:** Begin with gentle hops or low-impact jump rope exercises, focusing on soft landings and proper form.
* **Consult Your Doctor:** Especially if you have osteoporosis or balance issues, get medical clearance before starting new exercises.
* **Prioritize Nutrition:** Ensure you’re getting enough protein, consider creatine supplementation, and check your vitamin D levels.
* **Stay Consistent:** Even short sessions—just a few minutes a day—can make a big difference over time.

# Real References

* **Jump Training and Bone Density:** Systematic review and meta-analysis showing benefits for femoral neck bone density in adults, including older adults.
* **Hopping for Hip Strength:** Loughborough University study demonstrating up to 7% increases in hip bone density with two minutes of daily hopping.
* **Creatine and Muscle Health:** Meta-analyses showing increased lean mass and strength in older adults supplementing with creatine during resistance training.
* **Protein and Function:** Research linking higher protein intake to better muscle mass, strength, and reduced disability in older adults.
* **Vitamin D and Bone Health:** Evidence supporting vitamin D’s role in bone and muscle health for seniors.

**In summary, by combining the bone-strengthening effects of jumping with targeted nutrition, seniors can move beyond mere survival—building the strength, stability, and confidence needed to truly thrive.    \*\***SeniorHealth\*\*

I have never been in a relationship, but I hav been close I would like to think. Ended up getting played like a fiddle. 

A little about me, I was born and still live in Kentucky. Meaning I’m from the U.S. I’m a bigger guy, who currently works nights, losing weight (40 pounds in the last year). I will send a pic if we make it that fair. People tell me I’m nice, caring, kind, and extremely patient and passionate. 

Hobbies: I’m a heavy gamer, play on pc. I have played a lot of games and a ton of genres. I’m heavily into music, as I play guitar and listen to a ton of genres of music from Jazz to metal, and from Hip-hop-blues. Will make you a playlist :). Some smaller things I like is poetry, listing to audio books, and coffee. 

Now the big question, what am I looking for? Something that is real. Something that I can look forward too. Meaning, messages when I wake up in the late afternoon after working all night. Goodnight messages, random texts that I can laugh at. Most importantly, some to just hold at the end of day. Anywhere is fine for me, but UK, U.S., Canada, and Europe. However, I don’t really care to be honest. I believe types are just preference, and love out of built respect is better than attraction. Don’t really care about looks, but if your a pale goth type or style (I think that fits) you have my heart. 

Please feel free to message, I will get back to you, more than likely, very very late at night while I’m working. I will end this with a joke

So I have been very deep into coffee for quite a while. I run a small roasting business, have gotten countless friends set up with nice pourover/grinder setups, worked as a barista for years before as well, do a v60 every morning, etc...

  
BUT I am still using my $50 jaffee aliexpress grinder which has gotten surprisingly great results. Granted, its a stainless steel 48mm burr (I searched for ages to find that price on a solid 48mm burr back 5 years ago or so), nonetheless its cheap.

  
However now I am thinking it is time for an upgrade. Please help me decide if you're willing to give your opinion :)

  
1. I love Kenya.  99.9% of Kenyas are washed. I love the bright and acidic forward cup Kenya brings.

  
2. I also do love some natural Ethiopia (as you do, IYKYK)

  
3. Been getting into roasting and trying some Colombia pink bourbons (mostly natural, fancy). Love that fruity but still funky and not straight cinnamon earthy classic colombia (not to knock classic colombias, they have their place)

4.  Everything I like is super light.



SO - My first thought has been the K-ultra grinder. I found one for \~200. The only reason I don't go for the ZP6 first in my mind is the fact that I do occasionally do espresso, and in the future my wife and I are moving to a part of the world where there is less electricity and I will probably bring my ROK espresso and my v60, so having one grinder that can do both seems expedient (is that how you use that word?)

  
Anyways, any thoughts or recommendations?  Is that a good price? Should I consider a different option? Does anyone think it would be worth going through the process of having two grinders just for the ZP6?

1lp35ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bahrain/comments/1lp35ez/never_study_at_ruw_royal_university_for_women/,Never study at RUW (Royal University for Women),"Hi to whoever’s reading this,

In 2025, I graduated from RUW, and I just wanted to share what my time there really felt like.
I’d rather not say my name because I don’t want anyone who studied with me to know who I am.

I was just an ordinary art and design student who loved art deeply. I didn’t have a royal title like “Sheika,” and I didn’t come from a rich family. Honestly, I struggled a lot to pay my tuition and dorm fees. But that’s not why I’m writing this. I want to share what it’s really like to be a regular student here.

To tell the truth, it was the loneliest and most depressing period of my life.

Let me start with the teachers. Most of them were actually really kind and helpful. They would listen, support you, and try to guide you. Some were so nice that students would take advantage of them and walk all over them. And then there were a few teachers who really did make things worse. They would lie, make fake promises, and leave you feeling stupid and worthless. But thankfully, they were only a small part. What hurt was seeing good teachers getting disrespected by students who acted like they were better than everyone else.

And about those students.
There were three types that were the hardest to deal with: the princesses, the rich girls, and the know-it-alls.
Not every princess was rude, some were genuinely nice, but most were so full of themselves that they treated others like they didn’t matter. The rich students had the money to buy fancy tools and supplies, and they often looked down on the rest of us who couldn’t do the same. The know-it-alls were the hardest to be around. They would do everything to please teachers, take extra courses outside, and make you feel like you were talentless next to them.

Being surrounded by these students made me feel invisible and worthless. It wasn’t just that I didn’t have money, it was that I couldn’t find anyone who understood what it felt like to be just normal. The whole place felt snobbish and cold, and I never really fit in. I always felt judged just for being myself. And because of that, I barely made any friends or happy memories. It was honestly the loneliest I’ve ever felt.

Academically, things weren’t great either. We had maybe one truly qualified teacher who taught us properly. But often, the university hired teachers with no real background just because they were desperate. Many students didn’t care about learning, they only cared about getting easy grades. We even had a really good teacher for one subject, but students complained he was too strict, so they replaced him with someone who gave everyone A’s. Without YouTube and online tutorials, I wouldn’t have learned anything. It really felt like paying so much money for nothing.

And speaking of money, RUW takes a lot of it, especially from wealthy students, but you barely see anything improve. We didn’t have proper tools, machines, or even decent printing allowances. You had to pay extra if you printed more than 12 pages. There was a 3D printing room that was always locked. Other universities with less money had better facilities, and it made me wonder where all the money goes.

The cafeteria was also pretty sad. Just a greasy, overpriced burger place and a coffee shop. The only useful thing was the small supermarket. And the dorms weren’t great either. If you couldn’t cook or afford constant food delivery, your only option was the vending machine. They didn’t even bother to have a small cafeteria for students who were too busy to cook. And if you didn’t drive, you had to pay about 7 BD for an outside taxi just to go anywhere, or ask someone random in the dorms for a ride, which felt unsafe. I’ve even seen old, run-down dorms do better because they at least offered free rides to nearby places.

So that’s my honest story.
RUW isn’t the worst university on the planet, but in my experience, it’s definitely the worst in Bahrain.
If you’re rich, love showing off, and don’t mind a cold and snobby environment, maybe you’d fit right in. But if you’re like me, just an ordinary student who loves what they do and wants to belong, it might end up being the loneliest and most disappointing time of your life.

Thought I would move up in the company, but never got the chance to. I moved back to my home state now and started working in an organic veggie farm. It was hard work but I was loving it. I thought it was going well but the owner let me off saying it wasn't worthwhile because of scheduling. I'm so depressed. He had made it sound like I could grow there and our values really seemed aligned. Out of the he blue tells me this is my last week. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to make a humble living doing work that doesn't make me depressed and feel less than. I'm open to going back to school and or getting some certifications but I don't know what for. Thinking massage school but be approachable and open the door to the holistic health and wellness industry but I'm not sure.

Okay, Reddit fam, I need to share something I’m genuinely excited about: this Parisian style vegan leather tote. I've been on the hunt for a new everyday bag that ticks all the boxes, and I think I've finally found ""the one.""

A little background: I'm a 38-year-old working woman who loves fashion but is also trying to make more sustainable and ethical choices. It's been surprisingly hard to find a bag that aligns with both my style and my values. So many totes either fall apart quickly, look cheap, or are made from materials I'm not comfortable with.

**Why This Bag Is Different (And Why I'm Obsessed)**

First off, the style is just *chef's kiss*. It has that effortlessly chic Parisian vibe that I absolutely adore. It's simple, but the details make it special. Plus, it's made of vegan leather, which is a huge win for me. Knowing that this bag is cruelty-free makes me feel so much better about carrying it around.

But here's the real kicker: it's like getting two bags in one! It has dual designs, so you can switch up the look depending on your outfit or mood. Seriously genius, and it saves me so much time in the morning when I'm rushing to get ready.

**Features I'm Loving**

*   **Stylish Design:** Seriously, it just looks good. I’ve already gotten so many compliments on it.
*   **Vegan Leather:** Feels great, looks great, and I don’t have to worry about harming any animals.
*   **Dual Designs:** This is the game-changer. It’s like having a whole new bag whenever I want.
*   **Durable Construction:** This thing feels solid. I’m not worried about it falling apart anytime soon.
*   **Organized Interior:** Pockets for everything! My keys, phone, wallet – all have their place.
*   **Lightweight:** Even when it’s full, it doesn’t weigh me down.
*   **Easy-to-Clean:** Spilled my coffee on it the other day (oops!), and it wiped right off.
*   **That Cute Lips Print:** Adds a pop of color and personality.

**Benefits I've Experienced**

*   **Style Confidence:** I feel put-together and stylish, even on my most casual days.
*   **Ethical Satisfaction:** Knowing I’m supporting a more sustainable product makes me feel good.
*   **Versatility:** The dual designs mean I can use it for work, travel, or just running errands.
*   **Organization:** No more digging around in a bottomless pit! Everything is easy to find.
*   **Comfort:** The lightweight design is a lifesaver for my shoulder.

**The Emotional and Financial Perks**

I know it sounds silly, but this bag has actually boosted my confidence. When I feel good about what I'm wearing (or carrying), I just feel more ready to take on the day. And honestly, not worrying about whether my bag is harming the environment is a huge weight off my shoulders.

Financially, I think it's a smart investment. I used to buy cheap bags that would fall apart after a few months, meaning I was constantly replacing them. This bag feels like it's going to last, so I'm actually saving money in the long run. I found it on ursupermart.com, which had a great selection and easy checkout.

**Addressing the Problems**

This bag solves a few key problems for me:

*   **The ""Ugly Bag"" Problem:** No more carrying around a boring, unstylish bag.
*   **The ""Environmental Guilt"" Problem:** I can feel good about using a vegan leather product.
*   **The ""Disorganization"" Problem:** Everything has its place, making my life so much easier.

**Why It's Unique**

What makes this bag truly unique is the combination of style, ethical materials, and versatility. I haven't found another bag that offers all three. It's the perfect blend of Parisian chic and conscious consumption.

**SEO Keywords in Action**

I know some of you are probably wondering where to find a ""vegan leather tote bag"" that's also ""stylish"" and ""durable."" I did a ton of research before settling on this one, searching for things like ""best designer tote bag for everyday use"" and ""ethical fashion tote bag made from recycled materials.""

**Final Thoughts**

If you're looking for a ""Parisian style tote bag"" that's both stylish and ethical, I highly recommend checking this one out. It's a bit of an investment, but I think it's worth it for the quality, versatility, and peace of mind.

Okay, Reddit, I gotta share something I'm actually stoked about, and I rarely get *this* excited over a bag. You know I’m always hunting for that perfect blend of style, ethics, and practicality, and I think I finally found it. I've been on the hunt for a new everyday bag for ages, something that doesn't scream ""I'm trying too hard,"" but also isn't, like, a grocery sack.

I stumbled across this Parisian Stylish Vegan Leather Tote, and honestly, the ""dual design"" thing got me. Basically, it's like having two bags in one. It has a cool, classic design and then pops of color with this really fun lip print.

First off, the style is on point. I’m a sucker for anything with that classic Parisian vibe (even though I’ve never *been* to Paris, lol). It just looks effortlessly chic, you know? And the vegan leather actually feels really nice - not plasticky or cheap. I’ve bought some real stinkers on the quest for vegan alternatives, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.

I'm trying to be more conscious of my purchases. Knowing this tote is made with vegan leather makes me feel way better about using it. No guilt! I’m not perfect by any means, but every little bit counts, right?

Practicality-wise, this thing is a champ. I haul around *a lot* of stuff on a daily basis – laptop, water bottle, book (pretending I'll have time to read it), makeup bag, the usual chaos. The inside is surprisingly roomy and organized. No more digging around for my keys at the bottom of a black hole! Also, major bonus: it’s lightweight! I have a chronic shoulder issue, so a heavy bag is a no-go for me.

The fact that it’s easy to clean is another HUGE win. I’m a magnet for spills, it’s a curse. I’ve already had to wipe it down once after a rogue coffee incident, and it cleaned up like a dream.

The ""dual design"" is really clever too. Sometimes I feel like rocking the plain side and other times I want a bit of fun with the lips.

I was looking for the best designer tote bag for everyday use, but I didn't want to spend a fortune. This vegan leather tote bag hits that sweet spot of looking high-end without breaking the bank. For anyone on the hunt to buy vegan leather tote bag, I can confidently suggest that you give it a go.
I even got a compliment on it the other day at the coffee shop! That never happens to me. I felt like I actually had my life together for a hot second, haha.

It really does solve that problem of needing a stylish, ethical tote bag that's also versatile. Ursupremart.com had this one and they always come through with good quality items.

If you're looking for an ethical fashion tote bag that doesn't sacrifice style, I highly recommend checking this one out. I think it is going to become my best designer tote bag for everyday use.

It's helped me feel a bit more put-together and confident, which is something I definitely wasn't expecting from a bag. Plus, knowing I’m making a slightly more sustainable choice is a good feeling.

Honestly, I was tired of schlepping around multiple bags or feeling guilty about my non-vegan choices. This tote tackles both of those problems.

I know how frustrating it can be searching for something that ticks all the boxes – stylish, practical, ethical, and affordable. So, I figured I’d share in case anyone else is on the same quest.

Going to the gym has been a failure for me several times and I always end up paying a membership to stay home. 

I've recently been getting up early to go for walks in the early morning and its been okay but I only walk for maybe 10 minutes and then I start my workday. So my plan is to walk (if I can convince my brain and body to actually do it) and come home to a nice cup of coffee. Then I'll fast until dinner around 5pm, with maybe a sweet treat for dessert, and start fasting at night around 6pm. 

My cup of coffee will absolutely break my fast because I can't stand black coffee or even sugar free sweetener in black coffee. Not only is it yucky to me, it's also too acidic without the cream and affects my acid reflux. So I'll fast from 6pm to 7:30 AM and then drink my coffee with cream and then continue to not eat until 5pm.

---

You know what I noticed? Most SwiftUI tutorials show you how to build buttons, but they skip the part about making them feel alive.

Here's the thing: button animations aren't just visual polish – they're essential communication tools. When users tap a touchscreen, visual feedback becomes their primary confirmation that an action occurred.

## What You'll Learn

In my comprehensive guide, I walk through everything from SwiftUI animation fundamentals to advanced interactive patterns:

🎯 **Essential Animation Patterns:**
- The classic press effect (your bread and butter)
- Bounce animations with spring physics
- Glow effects for primary actions
- Custom timing curves that feel natural

⚡ **Advanced Techniques:**
- Chained animations for complex sequences
- Multi-state button behaviors (loading, success, error)
- Long-press indicators with progress feedback
- Gesture-responsive effects

💡 **Real-World Implementation:**
- Performance optimization tips
- Accessibility considerations (reduce motion support)
- When NOT to animate (the honest take)
- Building reusable animation components

## The Key Insight

The best button animations are the ones users don't consciously notice – they just enjoy a smooth, responsive experience that feels polished and professional.

From basic `.scaleEffect()` transformations to sophisticated state-driven animations, this guide covers patterns that work in real production apps.

## Code Examples Include:

```swift
// Simple but effective press feedback
.scaleEffect(isPressed ? 0.95 : 1.0)
.onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration: 0, maximumDistance: .infinity, pressing: { pressing in
    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.1)) {
        isPressed = pressing
    }
}, perform: {})
```

Plus advanced patterns like progress indicators, state-driven animations, and performance-optimized implementations.

## Why This Matters

After shipping multiple SwiftUI apps, I've learned that these micro-interactions make the difference between an app that feels amateur and one that feels professional. Users might not notice good animations, but they definitely notice when they're missing.

[What to watch at the Calgary Stampede](https://www.reddit.com/r/eiiuwqwqs/comments/1lp2cwh/how_to_watch_calgary_stampede_2025_for_free/) Rodeo and chuckwagon races



Every afternoon at 1:30, the world’s best rodeo athletes compete for a total of $2.17 million in prize money. Chuckwagon races take place nightly at 7:30 p.m.



Rodeo tickets include free admission into Stampede Park for that day. Assigned seating tickets can be purchased online and standing room only tickets will be available at the gate day-of starting at 11 a.m.

Barrel racing



In a race against the clock, contestants circle three barrels and race back to the score line. Riders are permitted to touch barrels, but a five-second penalty is added to their time if one is knocked over.



Bull riding



Riders attempt to remain mounted on a bull while the animal bucks violently. While not required to move their feet, riders can get higher marks if they spur.



Tie-down roping



A cowboy riding horseback chases a calf with a 10-foot head start, attempting to rope the calf and dismount on the run to reach it and tie three of its legs.



Steer wresting



A steer wrestler on horseback chases a steer with a 12-foot head start, eventually dropping from his horse and grabbing the steer by its horns. A steer must be on its feet before being rolled to the ground, and once on its side the official time is taken.



Saddle bronc



A rider will move his feet from the horse neck toward the back of the saddle as the bronc bucks. hand placement is key in this eight-second event.



Bareback riding



Needing to hold on for at least eight-seconds, bareback riders extend their feet far forward on their horse and pull their feet up toward the rigging around the horses girth in a spurring motion. The higher the spurs, the higher the score.



Breakaway roping



Requiring speed and precision, breakaway roping is one of the fastest events in rode. The rider, following a calf with a head start, is required to rope the calf and stop their horse as quickly as possible. This will cause the rope to “breakaway” from the saddle horn it is tied to, and time stops. Ladies’ breakaway roping is new to the Calgary Stampede rodeo this year.



Chuckwagon races



Watch nine nightly heats as 27 chuckwagon drivers and 162 horses race for prize money.

Yesterday, I moved house and today my furniture arrived. Since yesterday, I've been having horrible crying and sobbing (sometimes almost wailing, I feel so distressed, but I try to hold back from making too much noise even though it's extremely hard) and it has been nearly constant. Whenever I think about my old house, the most trivial things, I start to cry. It's not just the memories, but the routines, and these routines can't be replaced. Things aren't where they were, and the sights, textures and sounds that I saw on a daily basis are gone. I cried when I thought about the view out my window, the colour of the lighting, the dust on the light, the feel of the carpet. I cried when I thought about my ritual of making coffee, and that the motions I would go through are gone. I realise it sounds absurd, because I can still make myself a coffee, but it's the small things that are different.

The light in my study is too bright, too white, it hurts my eyes.

I realise it sounds silly but I've been like this for over 35 hours now and I feel like I'm falling apart. I have friends, but I feel like I can't tell them because they won't understand how I could be this distraught (having what feel like panic attacks/meltdowns for 35 hours) because of a change of house. I was in the bath crying for before and it got so bad that I was struggling to breath.

The only thing that stops me from crying is not wanting my parents to worry or see. I genuinely don't know what to do, my body and brain feel like they can't cope and I can't stop crying and having panic attacks. I go from feeling sort of okay, to crying, to full on wailing. IMemories of my old house rush to me in such vivid detail whenever I do anything that reminds me of that house, or even when I try to do things to deliberately keep my mind off it. I've tried doing breathing and grounding exercises but nothing is calming me down.",17,1751379560.0,AutismInWomen,7,0.95,False
1lp2vfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthspanStacks/comments/1lp2vfk/quick_morning_stack_for_people_who_hate_mornings/,Quick morning stack for people who hate mornings,"I used to be absolutely terrible at mornings. 

But I've slowly figured out a morning routine/stack that doesn't make me want to crawl back into bed. The key was making it stupid simple and focusing on things that actually compound for me.

# Sleep First

**The biggest win?** Going to bed earlier. I HATED this idea for the longest time. I kept trying to be a night owl, staying up until 11pm or worse watching pointless TV shows or scrolling my phone. But tbh I wasn't doing anything productive anyway.

Turns out I'm just naturally an early riser but I was fighting it for years. Now I'm asleep by 9pm and up at 5am. Life changing isn't an exaggeration.

**Evening prep stack:**

* Blackout curtains + low lighting in the house
* Phone in another room (this was huge)
* Magnesium glycinate 30 min before bed
* Room temp as low as possible

**Immediate wake-up (first 2 minutes):**

* Chug a glass of water (kept by bedside)
* Open curtains/blinds immediately
* Take pre-portioned supplements

**My supplement stack:**

* Vitamin D3 (5000 IU)
* NMN (500mg)
* Fish oil (high EPA/DHA)
* Sometimes add: B-complex if I'm feeling sluggish

I also take creatine, TMG etc but have this pre-workout.

**Movement (next 10-15 minutes):**

* Get outside for a walk - even just around the block
* Light stretching while coffee brews

That's literally it. The walk outside gets my sunlight exposure, light movement, circadian rhythm reset etc etc. Plus walking first thing just feels better than trying to force myself into some intense workout off the bat.

# After 6 months, my energy is stable all day, I don't crash at 3pm anymore, and I actually look forward to getting up. My HRV improved (up to 116 from 91 monthly average) and I feel way less stressed.

# For Fellow Morning Haters

**Start with just ONE thing** \- don't try to stack everything at once. I started with just the water every day.

**Prep the night before** \- When you hate mornings, decision fatigue is your enemy. I lay out supplements, fill my water bottle, and set my clothes out. this feels like a pina but it's worth it.

**Track something simple** \- I just note my energy level 1-10 each day. Seeing the pattern helped me stick with it.

Anyone else discover they were fighting their natural rhythm? What's in your anti-morning-person morning stack?",1,1751379516.0,HealthspanStacks,0,1.0,False
1lp2v0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1lp2v0r/being_friends_with_an_ex_real_or_a_rouse/,Being Friends with an Ex - Real or a Rouse?,"I want to get some perspectives from people who probably struggle with this less than I do. 

I am autistic. I can read body language and cues but my intentions are usually very straightforward and I struggle to anticipate or understand manipulation. 

My ex and I were together for 6 months in a situationship. I wanted commitment, she didn't. That being said, she was exclusive to me for 6 months. We did everything couples do, but after we reached month 6 I couldn't tolerate the anxiety I was feeling any longer about her push/pull, her jealousy over me but not validating mine, and just the general toxicity. 

I broke up with her. She still to this day pretends she broke up with me. 

I went NC. I didn't block her. She posted a lot of bait for me on her stories and tried to contact me a few times, and then gave up after a few weeks. From my perspective it seemed obvious she was missing me and wanted to re establish contact. 

We ran into each other in person. She asked for coffee and then asked to extend it into lunch. We caught up, she admitted she'd missed me, we both said we are starting to see other people. She said she's seeing multiple men and told me all about them, and said it's nothing serious/long term. It stung to know she'd moved on so quickly, but I was also seeing someone else casually too (although with less gusto). 

She said she knows she could have me back whenever she wants. She asked if I'd be ok with her ending up with someone else (isn't that a strange question given we'd broken up and we'd both surely be aiming to end up with someone else?) She said she wants to be friends and likes talking to me. 

She always did that through our relationship btw. She'd say she loves talking to me, spending time, loves my mind, loves the sex, but would refuse to admit romantic interest even if it was obvious from some of her actions that she, at least, felt conflicted. 

She confirmed in our conversation, albeit by implication, that she did have feelings for me (she had previously said she didn't and realised it was only friendship) but that she wanted to be single and enjoy herself etc. 

Anyway, since the day we met up she has been contacting me more. Memes, a bit of daily conversation. She has hinted at wanting to see me in a neutral space again. 

The thing is, she's been telling me that eg she's had an STI scare from one of her flings recently. I'm finding it hurtful and also weird, because we are recent exes. I don't want to hear it and I don't want to know she's been having sex with several random guys unprotected. 

I don't understand what the point of her desire to talk to me is. I don't mind the idea of being friends but it doesn't feel like that's what's really going on. ",3,1751379488.0,emotionalintelligence,7,0.81,False
