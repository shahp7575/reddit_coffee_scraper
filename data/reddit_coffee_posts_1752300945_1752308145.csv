1lxv7n4,https://v.redd.it/mv7ppbmxiecf1,Norian is just a silly guy,"Explanation: Archibald Forge is the principal of the Celestial Crest High academy, an hero school. He's a retired hero, frank, without mincing words, with a taste for whisky, and is regarded as friendly with almost everyone working in the school

Almost 

Introducing: Guillaume Norian, one of the teachers. He's a self-destructive, slightly arrogant, extremely cynical and misanthropic, pessimistic, that has a great sense of deduction, and a better one to find hiw to annoy everyone, to make sure that no one will be near thus emotional train wreck 

When Norian walks into his office, that usually means that he will do something crazy in the school for his class, or that he has done something crazy to save pupils or colleagues, that would have been wiser to ask for his green light 

Why isn't Norian fired? First of all, he's excellent as a teacher, if we believe the exams of the subjects he teaches. Second, it's hard to find a hero that would agree to stop their activities and teach. Third, almost every time someone from the school is in danger, or when the school is in danger, he fights. Extremely well

1lxv2ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1lxv2ft/will_never_be_able_to_repay_student_loan_how_do_i/,Will never be able to repay student loan? How do I proceed?,"I am 74 years old. I am not American. I do not live in America. I am autistic, have PTSD, an auditory processing disorder, and have never been able to hold down a job in my life. I immigrated to America as I won a Green Card (I would never have qualified), and I went to college in my mid-50s as I couldn't find a job. 

I took the wrong degree, had no idea how college worked (had the social understanding of a child and had no idea of the relationship between college and work). I didn't know I was autistic either.

I had a loan of about $4000 which increased to $7000 in terms of interest because after I left America, I wouldn't sign in because I was too scared of being scammed. 

I now owe about $7000 and have never made a payment since 2008/9 when I graduated. I have never used my degree and have only had jobs for about one or two months in that time, never earning enough to even cover rent and food. I shared.

I have earned some money since then, but as I have other more urgent expenses (medical, etc.) there has been no money over. In any event, except for once, my income has been between $140 per month and $400 a month. I have just managed to get some money from the government to subsidise me - another $400 per month. This takes the tremendous stress off me. Only once did I receive a normal amount in a year, and that was through people giving me money to help me. That was in the middle of Covid.

The loan forms on the student web site only give options of how much I must repay and they ask me when I think I will be able to repay. The answer is never - not unless I win the lottery, and I don't have money to enter the lottery. A treat is a cup of coffee out once or twice a month. 

What must I do? I think that the entire policy is inhumane. I would not even have entered the green card lottery if I had known my real issue was that I was autistic. I didn't know. I just spent a life time enduring bullying, being taken advantage of, and I thought that if I went to America, things would change. They didn't.

I left because I couldn't find a job, and I couldn't pay the rent, and it was easier to go to a cheaper country. I have a small income but it is nowhere near enough to pay rent, and I fear one day I will be homeless. I am also getting too tired to keep filling in these forms. My health is not optimal.

  
Thank you.

Need advice regarding supplementing and what to incorporate to my diet. My results came back from the doctors and my progesterone level is at 0.7 ng/mL. I have not had my period for over a year, I stopped taking birth control 15 months ago and I was on the pill for roughly 7 years. 

I did ultrasound and I have a lot of eggs but I am not ovulating (eggs falling down) so I am very fertile, I am just not functioning.

I have started eating more aligned with peat influences, but eat mostly eggs and milk products with fruit etc, added gelatine to my coffee. Having been pescetarian for a long time I am bad at preparing/cooking meat, since I am pretty new to it.

  
My question is, should I order the progesterone supplement Progest-E? And see what happens?

  
What else could I do to help my body out? My doctor basically said that I should wait for it to come back naturally but as I am 34 yrs old I feel a bit stressed out about the situation.

Veo en redes que la gran mayor√≠a se preocupan de manera hasta enfermiza por cosas que no tendr√≠an por qu√©, como si fueran adultos de 70 a√±os, empezando  por ver con muy malos ojos el hecho de tener relaciones casuales de una noche con alguien o bien, las relaciones abiertas com√∫nmente llamadas ""un culito"" o ""un picador"" (bajo la excusa pseudocientifica de que ""drena"" tu energ√≠a sexual), son homof√≥bicos a lo desgraciado, no les gusta salir de fiesta, ven con muy malos ojos que alguien se beba unas cervezas y salga a un antro o bar de manera ocasional, o que alguien fume, y de la dr0b4s como la mota ni hablar,  y por ello les encanta la idea insulsa de los ""coffee partys"" ""pilates"" etc. Tienen una autoestima por los suelos en su mayor√≠a, y sus ideales de belleza son sacados de alg√∫n influencer y obviamente no son reales, y aunque llevar una vida saludable ES IMPORTANTE, se ejercitan de manera endemoniada (llegando al exceso). Aspiran a tener un ""clean look old money"" y familia tradicional siendo que muchos vienen de hogares de clase baja disfuncionales, d√≥nde o viven con los abuelos porque ambos pap√°s trabajan porque no alcanza la lana, o bien, son hijos de madres solteras.

Recuerdo cuando ten√≠a su edad (y sonar√© como se√±or) que ser adolescente era ser tonto y no pasaba nada, uno no conoc√≠a nada del mundo, ten√≠a que descubrir nuevas cosas poco a poco, uno platicaba de tonter√≠as con sus amigos, el irte de pinta, socializar con gente de otras escuelas o grados, salir a las primeras fiestas (normalmente XV a√±os), beber tu primer cerveza, tener a ese amigo que siempre consegu√≠a una botella de licor o cigarros a escondidas con el se√±or de la tienda de su casa y se sent√≠a grande, salir a la plaza solos en bola al cine, a los bolos, a comer o a hacer cualquier otra cosa luego de la escuela, jugar botella en la escuela o en casa de alguien cuando iban a hacer un trabajo con retos (normalmente besos, quitarse la ropa, confesarse secretos, etc), descubrir la sexualidad libremente, sin prejuicios morales ni ideas m√≠sticas de ""energ√≠as masculinas/femeninas/sexuales"", cuando se pasaba a prepa ir a tardeadas/fiestas caseras/eventos con cover d√≥nde habia un DJ pedorro, alcohol barato y mucho ambiente, ir a los primeros bares, tener la novia de la prepa que pensabas ser√≠a el amor de tu vida, los fajes a escondidas en la escuela, en el cine o en cualquier lado, el bacanal que se armaba de todos contra todos entre amorios, besos y relaciones casuales entre compa√±eros del sal√≥n y otros grados, y en fin, cientos de cosas m√°s. Y de la universidad ni hablar.

Ahora todo ha cambiado, y mi hip√≥tesis es que muchos de los adolescentes hoy en d√≠a crecieron aislados y tomando clases en l√≠nea durante la pandemia, durante una √©poca de muchos cambios e incertidumbre, y no pudieron vivir ni socializar como todas las generaciones antes (no por nada muchos adolescentes hoy en dia son t√≠midos, ensimismados, no retienen la atenci√≥n por m√°s de 4 segundos y desarrollan relaciones parasociales raras con sus influencers), todo ello sumado a TikTok fueron el caldo de cultivo perfecto para que desarrollaran esta manera de ver el mundo, m√°s boomer que los boomers.

***Memory transcription subject:*** ***Specialist Onso, Starfleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31, 2136*

‚Äú*\*Yawn\** How long was I out for? Let me grab us some Raktajino.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccording to the ships timekeeping it would seem like you have slept for **\[5 hours\]**‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, not like anything has happened, you need the rest after what has happened. Still don‚Äôt know how you convinced Colonel Kira to get us assigned on patrol duty so quickly even if you were cleared for duty.‚Äù

Mika was silent for a few moments as I heard the hum of the replicator activate for our beverages. I was currently in my seat at the helm of the *Hummingbird* as we were currently at cruising speed through the newly captured territory that the Alliance had taken from the Arxur. The area we were assigned was a lower risk one compared to the other border stretches considering that most of it was Tilfish territory and intelligence believed that they had spent most of their ships on the recent attack on Khoa.

Mika had received an all clear for a return to duty from both Vensa and Councilor Troi with the expectation on my part to wait for orders from the Admiral or to assist with ship operations. Mika had other ideas as he *somehow* when I had left the room to get a bite to eat contacted our superior in the chain of command (Colonel Kira) and asked her for orders. That is how we ended up patrolling in our now fully repaired ship. Shortly after we had gone to warp Mika had done some long range scans but after they showed nothing out of the ordinary had stated that he would ‚Äúlay down for just a bit‚Äù. Not wanting to disturb him when he was not needed I had elected to let him sleep, I do have to admit that a few times I went over to his bed alcove to check on him (he seemed to have forgotten to close the privacy screen.) and when I had done so my heart fluttered as I looked at his sleeping form. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that we were on mission right now I would have gotten in with Mika to cuddle with him as we have done a few times already. I had greatly enjoyed that as Human‚Äôs had a higher body heat than the Yotul and it felt so *warm* to be with him.

I was snapped out of my thoughts as I heard the sounds of Mika‚Äôs boots tapping on the ground as he approached with the Klingon coffee, the familiar scent of the beverage greeted my nostrils along with a spicy, woody aroma as well. When Mika set the beverage in front of me I saw that on top of the coffee was a slight coating of what almost looked like sawdust from dark lumber. Another sniff revealed it to be the source of that delightful added scent. When I turned my attention to Mika I saw that his beverage had a white topping of sorts that had the same sort of dusting on it as well, when he took a sip of the beverage and some of the white topping got on his nose he noticed it and started to laugh and I joined in with him. Moments like these made me feel *warm* all over and want to stay here forever with him.

""I have my ways"" Mika replied ""Bajorans love me""

I decided to take the plunge and test the flavor of this seasoning on my beverage, Mika has yet to lead me astray with any of his food or drink recommendations. After I raised the blue mug to my mouth and took a sip the first flavor to hit my tongue was the warm and earthy spice of the flavorings, next was the richness of the base beverage along with some nuttiness as well. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back as I savored the flavor when I heard a chuckle from Mika.

‚ÄúSo what is this mystery flavor you decided to add to my drink?‚Äù I asked him in a playful tone.

‚ÄúIt's a spice blend from Earth called pumpkin spice and is named that because it was first popularised as the blend used for the dessert pumpkin pie.‚Äù Mika responded while looking over the scanner readings. ‚ÄúWe have been adding it to beverages, specifically coffee for centuries. Due to the warmth of the flavor profile and the time of year you would have pumpkin pie it is considered a fall to early winter blend. I thought that you would enjoy it and I thought it appropriate considering the holiday.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can see why it is so popular.‚Äù I said, taking another sip before responding. ‚ÄúWhat is the holiday? Anything major or significant?‚Äù

‚ÄúHalloween, it‚Äôs a day that ancient humans believed was one the veil between the worlds of the living and dead would be the thinnest.‚Äù Mika stated while looking over the scans still. *What's taking him so long with that? I just did right before he got up and there was nothing.* ‚ÄúDifferent cultures did different things throughout history to celebrate but in modern days most humans don‚Äôt celebrate it for any sort of spiritual reasons save for pagans who do different ceremonies under the moonlight to try and speak with the dead or something. Anyways, the holiday currently is centered around kids, they dress up in costumes of different creatures or monsters from folklore and go around to different houses Trick or Treating where they knock on the door and the people inside give them candy.‚Äù

‚ÄúStrange on how it went from when dead and living are the closest to giving out candy to children in costumes.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs there something wrong with sensors? You are still looking at them.‚Äù

Mika took a large drink of his beverage before responding to me as he continued to work at his station. He seemed to be trying to focus the sensors on something.

‚ÄúRight before I sat down, sensors picked up a faint signal relatively close to the ship. It is really weak so that's probably why even with our sizable sensor array it was not picked up until now.‚Äù Mika replied as he seemed to be adjusting the sensors. ‚ÄúI am trying to clear it up to see what or who is causing the signal.‚Äù

After a few more moments there was a *beep* and Mika‚Äôs eyes widened with shock for a moment.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIt is a distress signal.‚Äù Mika responded. ‚ÄúSeems to be a standard OAF signal, some of it is degraded but it seems as if it was sent recently and the tagging seems to indicate its from a transport craft. I am honestly shocked that an OAF ship would fly into what they think is Arxur space.‚Äù

I was shocked as well, OAF doctrine is very clear about lone craft including military ships staying as far away from the Arxur territory as possible. Only the fleets were to be even near the grays space, the Nevoks were somewhat infamous for their merchant ships skirting these recommendations to speed up their transportation times so that they could have faster routes.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe are at war with the OAF and that includes the Tilfish.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are going to send a subspace message to Deep Space Nine telling them what we have found and that they will be apprised of any developments as soon as possible. I am going to plot a course, thankfully they are fairly close and it should only take a few **\[minutes\]** without us even having to increase speed.‚Äù Mika said. ‚ÄúWhat we will do when we arrive depends on what we find, if it's a civilian transport in need of assistance we will provide it and send them on their way with a warning that this is now Alliance space. If it is military personnel we will monitor them until we can get a larger craft here to detain them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù I responded as I sent the relevant information to DS9 like Mika told me to. ‚ÄúIt seems that Starfleet really is set on sticking to your rules of engagement and not attacking unless attacked first in these types of situations.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost certainly, Starfleet has a stellar reputation to uphold.‚Äù Mika responded in a half-joking tone as he adjusted our heading. ‚ÄúIn all seriousness though, the United Federation of Planets is *very* strict in its adherence to the Geneva Protocols and you *will* be sent to the Hague at the first sign of you violating them.‚Äù

I nodded to him in agreement, a habit I had picked up from being around so many UFP species. Despite not having tails or movable ears it seemed that the predators had plenty of nonverbal communication, mostly in their facial expressions. I had found it outrageous along with many who worked alongside Starfleet when it was suggested by politicians on more than one planet in the Revival Alliance that visors or masks be mandated for any UFP citizen when out in public so that their ‚Äúpredatory visage‚Äù did not scare the populace, thankfully no such laws have yet to pass on the planetary level, although on VP I had heard of a few rural districts passing much laws.

It was not long before we had dropped out of warp at our destination, scanners while in transit that this area of space was devoid of any planets or stellar infrastructure, only a small asteroid field that had somehow become rouge from a nearby star system. It did not take long for short range scanners to find the source of the signal on one of the asteroids, we moved towards it at full impulse to get a good look at what we would be working with.

What we saw visually was not promising, on the surface of an asteroid was the wreckage of an OAF transport craft. I could see several scorchmarks across the hull as well as different areas with hull breaches, *no survivors if they have been here this long with that many breaches*. I was pulled out of my thoughts as I heard a *beep* from scans being completed, I looked over them and was shocked at what I saw.

‚ÄúThere are two Tilfish lifesigns! One adult and one child, they are both in the help compartment.‚Äù I said with excitement. ‚ÄúIt appears that it still has an atmosphere and they are running on reserve power. I don‚Äôt know how much time they have, the air they have is slowly leaking and the hull is in pretty bad shape.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, let's hail them and see what is going on.‚Äù Mika responded as he started to send out the hail while seeming to squint at the viewscreen. ‚ÄúWe have even more of a reason to intervene if there is a child. The kid had no part in any of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúTilfish craft, this is Lieutenant Reissig of the Starfleet ship *Hummingbird.*‚Äù Mika said in the hail. ‚ÄúIf you are in need of assistance please respond.‚Äù

Mika had barely finished his message when the viewscreen flicked to life with a response from the Tilfish vessel. The room seemed fairly dark with only one overhead light operational and few details of the background visible due to lack of light. The person in front of the screen appeared to be a middle aged Tilfish woman who was wearing a blue sash that indicated she was in the Tilfish military, from the many medals adorning it she seemed to be rather high ranked. Huddled into her thorax was a much younger Tilfish, possibly a child who seemed much more calm than the adult in the current situation. The adult Tilfish seemed to be stroking his antenna which if memory serves correctly was a soothing gesture the Tilfish would perform on one another to stay calm.

‚ÄúThis is General Birla of the Tilfish Ambassadorship and I hereby request political asylum for myself and more importantly my son Virnt.‚Äù She said in a fearful voice, every breath she exhaled was visible, portraying the frigid conditions in the ship. ‚ÄúPlease, we don‚Äôt have much time. At least save my son, I beg of you!‚Äù The general cried

‚ÄúDo you believe yourselves to be targeted for violence or persecution based on political opinions, affiliations or immutable factors such as species or place of birth?‚Äù Mika asked hurriedly as he started to activate the transporter.

‚ÄúYes! Yes to all of those!‚Äù The Tilfish mother cried as she held her child even tighter to her body.

At that last statement Mika pressed a final command into the ship's interface and I saw the two Tilfish enveloped in the blue light of the transporter and a moment later I heard the hum of it behind me as they were being materialised. I turned around and saw that flash of light, once dissipated, saw the Tilfish general on the floor holding her son tightly.

Seeing that they were most likely frigid I went to one of the wall panels that held behind it survival supplies and pulled out a self heating blanket and gave it to the general who seemed grateful as she draped it over herself and her son. When I had gotten closer I had noticed that ice crystals had begun to form on their exoskeletons and when the general had moved there was a slight groaning sound from the joints.

‚ÄúGeneral Brila, Vernt.‚Äù Mika addressed the two Tilfish as he turned around to face them, causing the general to flinch as she seemed to realise that she was now in close proximity to a predator. Meanwhile the child had the opposite reaction as his eyes seemed to light up at seeing Mika. ‚ÄúAs the ranking Starfleet officer here I grant you temporary asylum until we can reach a United Federation of Planets facility for your claim to be processed. Under UFP law you are not required to tell me until we reach our destination the precise reasons for your asking for Asylum but I do ask that you tell me how you became stranded in case this ship is under any direct threat. Any questions?‚Äù

Brila seemed to have a blank stare on her face as she faced what was most likely in her mind a predator acting far more civilly than it had any right to be. Her son Vernt seemed to not be content with sitting still and was trying with little success to wriggle out of her grasp. As she stared I informed Mika that I would plot a course to UFP space and send a subspace message to DS9 as they were the closest Starfleet facility which Mika approved.

‚ÄúO-of course, p-pre- uh, Lieutenant. We were fleeing Sillis and went this way because though little intelligence was sent my I learned that you wiped out the Arxur in this area so it seemed the easiest way to flee from the Kolshian.‚Äù Brila responded as she struggled to hold Vernt still. ‚ÄúBefore we went to FTL one of the new Kolshian ships got a hit off on us and eventually we fell out of FTL. It was not long after we did that they dropped in on us and began firing those energy weapons and we crashed into that asteroid. The only reason Vernt and I are alive is that we had lost main power and were leaking atmosphere, so they left us to suffocate or freeze to death. From what I can tell those in the main compartment died nearly instantly from the first volley after they attacked us here.‚Äù

The Tilfish General was about to continue with her speech but was distracted by her child's eager attempts to loosen himself from her hold.

‚ÄúVernt, please stay still!‚Äù She pleaded. ‚ÄúYou still need to warm up. What has gotten into you?‚Äù

It had barely taken any time to send the message and to plot a course to UFP space so now I had a full view of the struggle between parent and child that was very one sided it seemed.

‚ÄúHumma! I get to see Humma now!‚Äù He cried as he renewed his struggle to free himself from what he most likely saw as the tyrannical grasp of his mother. ‚ÄúI-I has questions for Humma!‚Äù

‚ÄúBe quiet Vernt, they are kind enough to help us. Lets not tire them out with a hundred questions.‚Äù Brila said to Vernt before turning to Mika. ‚ÄúI am so sorry about him but he was obsessed with you predators ever since he saw a television broadcast that showed a Starfleet Admiral that is a Human. I don‚Äôt know how your young are but Vernt is very curious and doesn't always understand that adults can‚Äôt always answer his questions.‚Äù

Mika gave a small chuckle which seemed to cause the Tilfish general to shudder with fear from the sudden sound. If Mika noticed that he did not let it on before speaking.

‚ÄúI am not upset at all, Vernt is just a kid after all. Many human children are like that as well, many go through the *why* phase where they ask their parents why they do what they do or why they have any rules. We are going to be here for a bit so I can answer as many questions as the little guy has.‚Äù Mika then turned to Vernt to speak in a calm and soothing voice. ‚ÄúHey there Vernt, my name is Mika, your mom said that you are curious about humans. If you can calm down and stop squirming around I can answer some of your questions. How does that sound?‚Äù

Mika had barely finished speaking when Vernt had drastically changed, he stopped his incessant struggle against his mother and became stone still while staring at Mika .I was honestly surprised that Mika talked to children so well. He had never really given any sort of indication that he wanted to have children or spoken about having experience with them, yet here he was being the Tilfish child whisperer. Honestly it made Mika even more attractive that he was so caring to just about anyone it seemed.

Thought I'd share my recipe since ultra light roasts can sometimes be a bit tricky to brew.

This is a really nice coffee btw! Super clean and fun to brew.

**Brewer:** April Brewer (Plastic). This should also work well on an Origami with wave filters too.  
**Filter:** April Wave or Orea Wave filters (you might need to change things for Kalita)

**Dose:** 16 grams

**Grind size:** Medium coarse, 5 numbers and 2 steps on the Fellow Ode Gen 2. Should be about 21-22 clicks on the C2.  
**Water:** 240 grams at 96 degrees. 100 TDS, third wave water (classic light roast)

**Pouring structure:**

**0:00 - 0:30** 40 grams circle pour, 40 grams center pour  
**0:30 - 1:00** 40 grams circle pour, 40 grams center pour

**1:00**  40 grams circle pour, 40 grams center pour

**Total brew time:** 2:30

Each pour should be completed within 10-15 seconds in the typical April style. So basically, **pour fast**.

Hope this helps someone looking for a dial in : )",2,1752306207.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

We're getting married on a Saturday and want Sunday-Tuesday to be a chill staycation vibe, some may call it a mini moon. Just a few days to be alone together and relax and celebrate being newlyweds (we're having a HUGE wedding that will be fun and memorable but not relaxing).

Native to the general area but not NJ in particular. We tossed around the idea of Lake George but it's a little far and in my opinion better in the summer than late fall. Our venue is south and close to Philadelphia, we may end up there if no NJ location makes sense. We're not big NYC-lovers so that's probably out too. We live up North kinda near MetLife for reference.

Crystal Springs Resort in Hamburg seems to check most of our boxes - somewhere not too far, with awesome views, seemingly nice rooms, indoor pool, and good dining options. Online reviews are mixed and a lot say it's not worth the price. So I'm wondering if there are other places like that around that people recommend?

We literally just want to stay somewhere nice where we don't have to cook and clean, just unwind and cheers to our new marriage. Bonus points for beautiful nature and indoor pools (again, November in NJ).

Itinerary will likely be:  
\- Sunday: check-in, dinner and drinks, crash in our room after a long wedding weekend  
\- Monday: sleep in, chill vibes, explore the resort, talk a nice walk on a nature path or a swim, more dinner & drinks  
\- Tuesday: coffee and/or brunch and check out, get back home at reasonable hour

Max budget for this is probably around $1500 or $2000 all-in (stay, travel, drinks, food, fees), cheaper would be fantastic, I'm pulling that number kinda out of thin air right now.

19 months in and have noticed worsening symptoms in last few months mostly housebound but more recently spending more time bedbound and sleeping for days followed by not sleeping at all.  Recently I've noticed just doing the few indoor jobs I can do like the kitchen is now resulting in PEM and worsening symptoms for days feeling concussed like and further reduction in capacity and cognition as well as a non stop headache.  I could do these with pacing early in the year without making myself worse in the following days.  

2 nights ago quite late I decided to take some shrooms in the hope it would reduce my ongoing splitting headache.  I took about 2.5 grams, first bathing it in lemon to make it a lemon tek then added water and tea and had it on a low heat for about 20 minutes before straining the shrooms and drinking the tea / tek.  I did this as shrooms as pretty notorious for giving nausea and by not actually consuming the shrooms themselves I found my stomach copped much better as ongoing Gi symptoms are a thing for me every day.

Anyway it certainly did reduce the concussed feeling and the headache became almost non existing.  I definitely felt less foggy and found myself thinking about positive memories and relationships, My vision was slightly affected but it was by no means an overwhelming experience.  I stayed up all night and watched the sun rise over my balcony, it looked beautiful before I went to bed.  The following day when I awoke at 2pm I felt better than I had in the last 7 days and felt able to drive my car to go get coffee.  Did a little walk, managed to clean my house much more than  then the extent that had left me bedridden  days earlier for which my partner was very grateful when she got home from work and it felt nice to be capable enough to pull my weight in the household.

Today I cut down a palm tree my partner has been asking me to do for a while.  I used the chainsaw and while it felt great to feel good enough to get things done, I expect i have overdone it and will pay the price tomorrow.  Still after months of feeling to unwell to do things I just did, it's been a lovely little reprieve

Anyone experienced similar?

This is not medical advice.  Just asking if anyone has experienced improvement of pem and brain fog symptoms following a full dose of shrooms or a micro dose?

Please note I had prior experience of shrooms prior to long COVID and I am certainly not recommending anyone do this unless they plan to do so in a controlled clinical setting following discussions with their doctor.  ",2,1752306105.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

Aeropress Go ‚Äì Super reliable and travel-ready. My go-to for quick brews when I‚Äôm not pulling shots.

French Press ‚Äì Not for brewing, but for frothing milk. Works surprisingly well when you don't want to invest in a separate frother.

Timemore Chestnut C3 ‚Äì Absolute value-for-money grinder. Paired with RDT using the spray bottle before grinding for consistent performance.

Budget Hoffen Scale (Amazon) ‚Äì Gets the job done without breaking the bank. Would love a Timemore Black Mirror someday, but this works great for now.

Stovetop Gooseneck Kettle (InstaCuppa) ‚Äì No fancy temperature control, but works well for my  AeroPress flow control.

üîπ Storage & Vibes:

Wall-mounted IKEA pegboard ‚Äì Keeps everything neat and accessible. Hooks for cups and a small shelf for the essentials.

Cups & Glasses ‚Äì

Three pear-print straw glasses are perfect for iced coffee or cold brews.

A few clear and ceramic mugs for various brews depending on the mood.

For context, I work at a local coffeehouse in my town, which is also attached to a strip mall with a hardware store. A man who worked there would always come in and be overly friendly towards just the girls. The only times I've noticed him not being this way were towards our 50- and 30-year-old managers, but the rest of us are in our early 20s. He often talked about how he used to be in a gang, which, to no surprise, told me he's not a very good guy. He would come in at least five times a day for a coffee refill. I get it, customers can come in as many times as they wish and get a coffee; however, I felt he did it exclusively as an excuse to see and talk with us. Fast forward a few months ago, he quit or got fired from the hardware store - I say that because I've heard both stories and I'm unsure which one is true. I sent him a friend request on Facebook and he messaged me. I only added him because I treated him as a friend before I found out what was really wrong with him. He then started messaging me every day and basically was talking to himself because I wasn‚Äôt replying. Eventually, I ended up blocking him because I got creeped out. A few days ago, I was searching for something on my state's sex offender registry and I found a familiar name. I checked aliases and found that he goes by his middle name, not his first, so I found it. I googled his full name and found a recent mugshot of him, and he's been on the list since 1996 for aggravated sexual assault against a 14-year-old when he was 30.

I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.

Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden‚Äîmaybe we could head home together.

After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.

Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.

The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.

The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order‚Äîall the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.

I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.

He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.

But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew‚Äîcalm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.

As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.

I'd always considered this a strength.

Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.

That silhouette... was that Vera?

I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.

My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive‚Äîa breath of youthful energy.

But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.

Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.

Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""‚Äîto avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.

This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods‚Äî""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night‚ÄîAiden had had enough.

He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.

Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.

Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk‚Äîavoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.

So what was Vera doing here?

""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""

Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.

Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""

Complaints erupted immediately.

""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""

""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""

""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""

Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.

He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.

For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?

But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.

Chapter 2

My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.

The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.

An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning‚Äîbut from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.

Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.

Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright‚Äîshowing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.

She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.

As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.

Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.

He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.

Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients‚Äîafter that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""

I said nothing.

The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.

Every minute of waiting felt endless.

The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume‚ÄîVera's fragrance from earlier.

I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.

I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.

When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water‚ÄîI knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.

But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours‚Äîit could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""

Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""

And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?

Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance‚Äîwouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?

When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""

The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.

When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.

I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.

Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God‚ÄîI'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""

She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""

Chapter 3

Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""

Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.

I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.

The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""

I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction‚Äîthis ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.

I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.

Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.

The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute‚Äîin that moment, it made me nauseous.

Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""

Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""

My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?

Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.

Principles? Rules?

Apparently they only applied to me.

A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard‚Äîmaybe sensing my emotional turmoil.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.

The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""

""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.

Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""

Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""

Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.

A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.

""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""

Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.

In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.

I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.

On the other end of the line, Victor Powell's father, Albert Powell, asked, ""Seri, are you sure you want to terminate the agreement and divorce Victor?""

Serena Powell held her phone calmly. ""I'm sure.""

""Even if Leon's custody goes to the Powell family, you're still leaving?""

""Yes. I believe Leon would rather stay with his dad. The Powell family can give him the best education. He doesn't need me anymore.""

Albert's voice was low. ""Alright. As for the divorce agreement, you can talk to Victor yourself.""

""Okay,"" Serena replied.

Albert didn't hang up right away. ""To be honest, I've been satisfied with how Victor's been these past few years with you around.

""So, as a reward, I'll arrange for you to join the design team in Glonia you've always wanted. In a week at most, you'll be out of the Powell family.""

Serena thought, 'A reward? Rich people really do live in a different universe. In their world, even feelings come with a price tag.'

She agreed. After she hung up, her phone screen was still frozen on a recent Instagram post from her husband, Victor.

Victor had been posting bits and pieces of his daily life for over a month now, but this was the first time Serena had seen them. He had never accepted her friend request on his private account‚Äîuntil now.

In the newest video, their son Leon Powell was playing happily with another kid around his age. The ironic part was, everyone in the comments thought Serena was the one who filmed it.

Someone commented: \[Your wife's really good with the camera. Your son looks so happy.\]

Victor's reply stood out like a slap: \[Yeah.\]

Serena thought, 'Yeah? Is he praising Eliza Stone, his childhood sweetheart, for her camera work, or is he just letting people assume she's his wife now?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Serena grew up in an orphanage. Seven years ago, when she was still in college, Albert suddenly approached her and offered her three million dollars‚Äîto buy seven years of her life.

To pay for surgery for the orphanage director who had been kind to her, Serena reluctantly agreed.

Back then, she had already heard the story of Victor and Eliza. Both of them came from powerful families, grew up together as childhood sweethearts, and were deeply in love. But the year they graduated college, Eliza suddenly vanished without a trace.

When Victor found out Eliza had gone abroad for an arranged marriage, he completely lost it. He started drinking, smoking, and pushing himself to the edge, spiraling into serious psychological issues.

The psychiatrist once said only emotional healing could cure a wounded heart.

To save his nearly deranged son, Albert found Serena, who looked strikingly similar to Eliza, and had her care for Victor to heal his emotional wounds.

From then on, Serena began to get close to Victor on purpose, relentlessly pursuing him. She had that rare mix of innocence and allure. And with a face that looked just enough like Eliza's, she made sure to stay in Victor's sight every single day.

When he was down, she would cheer him up. When he got sick, she stayed up all night to look after him. And when his depression hit, she was the only one who ever reached into the darkness and pulled him back.

With time, Victor gradually got used to having Serena around.

Until one day, Serena caught him in the middle of a breakdown, about to slit his wrists. She grabbed the sharp blade with her bare hand and forced it out of his grip.

Her hand was sliced open, the cut deep and long, bleeding uncontrollably. The doctor said if it'd gone any deeper, she would've lost the use of her hand. Because the wound was so severe, even after it healed, a jagged scar remained across her palm.

That was the first time Victor hugged her. ""Seri, let's get married. Okay? Let's go to city hall tomorrow,"" he said.

Serena stood frozen, thinking it was her sincerity that had moved him. But later, when she found Eliza's wedding invitation tucked in a drawer, she realized it had all happened on Eliza's wedding day.

Less than two years after they got married, Serena gave birth to Leon. During those two years, Victor wasn't particularly affectionate, but he treated her with respect. Also, Leon was very close to her‚Äîhe clung to her more than he did to Victor.

Serena had feelings, after all. She had already come to see this place as her home. She loved both Victor and Leon deeply. It wasn't about the black-and-white contract anymore. She truly wanted to be with them for the rest of her life.

So for the sake of her family, Serena gave up her dream of being an accomplished designer and became a full-time housewife.

During the day, she cleaned the house. At noon, she brought lunch to Victor. In the evening, after picking Leon up, she cooked dinner for him. At night, she still had to meet Victor's needs in bed.

She was like a machine that never stopped working year-round, quietly and tirelessly taking care of her husband and son for five straight years.

Serena used to think things would just continue like that. But a month ago, Eliza came back. She was divorced and brought her son with her.

When Victor found out, he rushed to the airport without an umbrella, ignoring the heavy rain. He could even forgive everything Eliza had done in the past, as if none of it mattered anymore.

He thought Serena didn't know. But she knew everything. Over the past week, Victor had grown more and more impatient with her. He started treating her like a servant, barking orders at her. Even Leon had become cold and harsh toward her.

Serena had argued with them and fought back, but they called her ungrateful and narrow-minded. Then, in the next moment, they gave all their tenderness to Eliza.

Serena only found out about this through Instagram. Ironically, Victor never posted on Instagram. Even back when they got married, he refused to let her announce it on the app, saying it was their private life and he didn't want outsiders to know.

But ever since Eliza came back, Victor's Instagram had been full of pictures of the four of them‚Äîhim, Leon, Eliza, and her son. They all looked so warm and loving, as if they were the real family.

That was how Serena learned that when she was sick, Victor and Leon were out shopping with Eliza. When she was heartbroken, Victor and Leon were celebrating Eliza's birthday.

Even yesterday, on their wedding anniversary, Victor and Leon ignored the dinner Serena had spent the whole day preparing and walked out the door‚Äîjust to be with Eliza. When Serena tried to stop them, they told her she was being dramatic.

Serena thought, 'I should've realized it a long time ago. There's no place for me in this family anymore. I actually believed I could move beyond that contract and stay with them forever‚ÄîI was being delusional. It's time to wake up and leave.'

She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes with a cold hand.

Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from outside. Victor and Leon were back, the chill of the wind and rain still clinging to them as they came in.

""Seri, Leon fell and got hurt. Take care of his wound,"" Victor said, his voice low and steady, calm as always, automatically slipping into that usual commanding tone.

""I don't want her to do it. She never shuts up and nags the whole time."" Leon's brows were furrowed tightly, his face full of annoyance. ""I want Eliza to do it. I want to call Eliza.""

""The weather's too bad. Eliza can't make it,"" Victor answered, stepping inside indifferently, his voice flat. ""Be good. Let your mom handle it.""

""Okay, fine."" Leon looked disappointed and reluctant, his head drooping as he slumped onto the couch.

When he looked up and saw Serena still hadn't brought the first-aid kit over and was actually turning to walk away like she hadn't even heard them, his temper exploded. He shouted impatiently, ""Can you hurry up? What's with you today? So slow and annoying.""

# Chapter 2 Out Of Character

Serena turned to look at Leon, her eyes filled with coldness. ""That's how you talk to your own mother?"" she questioned.

Leon was startled by her reaction, completely thrown off. This was the first time Serena had ever spoken to him like that.

Even Victor paused and looked over, a trace of surprise in his eyes.

Leon shouted, ""What's your problem? You're the one who's standing there doing nothing. If it weren't raining and Eliza couldn't come, I wouldn't even need you‚Äî""

Serena cut in, ""Fine. Since you adore Eliza so much, then wait for her to take care of it.""

Leon froze, staring at Serena in disbelief as she walked away.

In the past, whenever he got hurt, Serena would panic, fuss over him, hug him, comfort him‚Äîbut today was completely different. She just left.

Victor was a little surprised too, but didn't think much of it. He frowned at Leon and said, ""Leon, you need to learn how to handle difficulties in life without letting your emotions get the best of you.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the bathroom, Serena stared blankly at the toiletries on the sink.

For the past few years, neither Victor nor Leon had ever had to squeeze their own toothpaste. She always got up a few minutes earlier to adjust the water temperature just right and lay out all their toiletries ahead of time.

She still remembered one time when the water had been too hot, and Victor snapped at her, ""Can't you even get something this simple right?""

Serena looked away. After taking off her clothes, she turned on the shower and let the hot water pour down on her, as if it could wake her up, again and again.

After a long time, she finally turned off the water. The look in her eyes grew more and more resolute. From now on, her life would no longer revolve around her ungrateful husband and son. She was going to live for herself.

When she came out of the bathroom, Leon was in his room. Victor was sitting on the couch, watching that ""family"" video on his phone. The corners of his mouth lifted without him even realizing, a clear sign of how pleased he was.

Serena let out a mocking laugh and walked over to the drawer. She then pulled out the divorce agreement and walked toward Victor. ""Victor, let's get divorced.""

Victor kept his eyes on the video playing on his phone and mumbled, ""Okay.""

Serena placed the divorce papers on the table. ""I'll walk away with nothing. You can have full custody of Leon too.""

Victor was still staring at his phone, seemingly absorbed in the comments under that Instagram post.

""If you don't have any objections, just sign it,"" Serena said.

""Okay."" Victor took the pen Serena handed him. He paused for a second, just as a notification popped up on his phone. Without even glancing at the agreement, he signed his name on the agreement.

Serena asked, ""Victor, did you even hear what I just said to you?""

""What?"" Victor shot her an impatient look, tossed the pen on the table, and leaned back on the couch. ""Isn't it about buying insurance for Leon? Just buy it.""

Serena realized he really hadn't heard a word. All his attention was on his phone. Ever since Eliza came back, she had gotten used to him being like this.

Just then, Victor's phone started ringing. It was a call from Eliza. He quickly turned around and stepped out onto the balcony to answer it.

Serena looked at the signed divorce papers on the table and let out a cold snort.

All it would've taken was one glance‚Äîhe would've seen it had nothing to do with insurance. But he didn't. His mind was filled with nothing but Eliza. He couldn't see anything else.

Serena put the divorce papers away and went back to the bedroom to pack her things.

Just then, the doorbell rang. When Serena opened the door, she was met with a delicate, innocent-looking face. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest.

It was Eliza. Even though Serena had only seen her profile in Victor's Instagram posts, she recognized Eliza instantly.

""You must be Mrs. Powell, right? Sorry to bother you this late,"" Eliza said. Standing next to her was her son, Oliver Stone, each of them holding a suitcase‚Äîone big, one small.

Serena remarked flatly, ""What do you need?""

""Is Victor home?"" Eliza asked.

""Yeah."" Almost the second he heard Eliza's voice, Victor rushed out from inside. ""I told you I'd pick you up. Why'd you come on your own? Come on in before you catch a cold.""

Eliza let out a dry laugh and didn't come in right away. Her eyes landed on Serena as she spoke, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm having some property issues back in the country, so I'll need to stay here for a few days.""

Serena smiled and thought, 'Stay here? Out of everywhere else, she has to move into her ex-boyfriend's house when he's already married? What is this supposed to be, taking over my place already? Making herself at home?'

Before Serena could say anything, Leon came running out of the house, cheering happily. ""Eliza, Ollie, you're finally here,"" he giggled.

He pushed past Serena, excitedly trying to welcome Eliza and Oliver inside.

Eliza greeted Leon but still didn't come in. She kept looking at Serena and asked cautiously, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm really sorry. I don't have many friends back home, so I had no choice but to turn to Victor. You don't mind, do you?""

Serena sneered, ""And if I do mind? Does that mean you're not coming in?""

Eliza clearly hadn't expected Serena to say that. Eliza froze, and before she could say anything, a young voice cut in ahead of her.

""What's your problem?"" Leon immediately stepped in front of Eliza to shield her. ""It doesn't matter if you mind. This is Dad's house.""

Eliza's expression changed. ""Leon, you can't talk to your mom like that. Your dad and your mom are married. That makes this her home too. She's the one who raised you. It hasn't been easy for her, and you should try to understand her.""

""Okay."" Leon lowered his head. Normally, he'd argue back for every word Serena said. But now, because of Eliza's words, he suddenly quieted down. ""I got it.""

Victor went ahead and picked up Eliza's luggage without waiting for Serena's response. ""Come in,"" he remarked.

Eliza looked at Serena apologetically and kept saying, ""Thank you.""

Serena just stood there quietly, watching them. Compared to the rest of them, she felt like she was the outsider here.

Serena scoffed a cold laugh in her heart. She wanted to go back to her room and pack her things, but Leon suddenly stopped her, saying, ""Where are you going? Hurry up and make dinner. Ollie and Eliza probably haven't eaten yet.""

""No, it's fine,"" Eliza said softly, trying to remind him. ""Leon, that's not appropriate.""

""No need. I'll cook today."" Victor was in a good mood and got up from the couch.

Eliza quickly grabbed his arm, then immediately pulled her hand back with a clear sense of boundaries. ""Don't trouble yourself. You guys just go on with what you were doing. I already ate before I came.""

Serena felt nothing but sarcasm inside. She'd known Victor for years. She could count on one hand how many times he'd stepped foot in the kitchen, let alone cooked.

She had always thought Victor simply didn't know how. But now it seemed he just didn't think Serena was worth the effort.

""All right, then I'll help you carry your suitcases to your room,"" Victor said. Since Eliza really didn't want to eat, he didn't insist. His eyes swept toward the bedrooms upstairs, and a trace of hesitation flickered in the depths of his gaze.

There were four bedrooms in the house. One belonged to Leon, one had been turned into a storage room, and the remaining two were his and Serena's.

A year ago, Victor had already suggested that he and Serena sleep in separate rooms.

# Chapter 3 Letting Go

That was why there wasn't any room in this house for Eliza at all.

Just then, Leon suddenly waved his little hand. ""Dad, let Eliza have Mom's room. It's big and bright‚Äîperfect for Eliza and Ollie.""

Victor paused for a second.

Eliza immediately caught the subtle shift in his expression and rushed to speak before he could say anything, ""No, that's not okay. If there's really no space, I'll take Oliver and find somewhere else to stay. I'm so sorry for bothering you.""

""It's no bother,"" Leon said, suddenly pouting. He turned his head and looked at Serena with urgency and grievance, raising his voice. ""Say something. What, you lost your voice today?""

Serena looked into Leon's eyes, full of blame. ""If Eliza takes my room, then where am I supposed to sleep?"" she questioned.

Leon puffed out his cheeks, clearly indifferent, his face turning red as he shouted like it was the most obvious thing in the world, ""The storage room has a bed. Just sleep there.

""You should be glad you even have a place to stay. Why are you being so picky?""

Hearing that, Eliza looked troubled. She stepped forward slightly, her eyes full of sincerity and apology.

She looked at Leon as she spoke gently, ""Leon, I'm a guest. Your mom is the host. How could I take the host's room? I'm already thankful she's letting me stay here. Oliver and I aren't going to be picky.""

Eliza turned to look at Oliver, who had been quiet the whole time. ""Right, Oliver?""

Oliver gave a calm nod.

""Well, Ms. Stone, you really know your place,"" Serena replied evenly, going along with her. ""So you all can figure out another plan for the room.""

Serena had swallowed her pride for years. She wasn't going to back down anymore.

Hearing that, Leon was furious. ""You're such a wretch. I knew you didn't really want Eliza to stay. You're so annoying.""

He put his little fists on his hips. ""But don't even think about kicking Eliza out. I'll just sleep with Dad, and Eliza and Ollie can have my room.""

Victor's eyes lit up. ""That works. It's settled then.""

Leon happily pushed the suitcases toward the elevator, and Victor led Eliza and Oliver to Leon's room.

Once again, Serena was the extra one. She was used to it. She went back to her room and started packing.

Not long after, Eliza came in with a cup of hot coffee in her hands. ""Mrs. Powell, may I come in? Are you packing for something? Going out?""

Serena didn't respond. She couldn't exactly tell Eliza she was leaving.

Eliza said, ""Leon poured this coffee for you. He may be little, but he's got a lot of pride. He was too embarrassed to bring it in himself.""

Serena didn't believe for a second that Leon had poured that coffee for her.

If Eliza hadn't shown up, maybe Serena would've believed it. But the Leon now hated Serena too much to even get her a cup of coffee.

Serena said, ""Ms. Stone, you don't need to smooth things over between me and Leon. The four of you living happily ever after is better than anything else.""

Even though Eliza had played innocent ever since she walked in‚Äîand had even stepped in a few times to help correct Leon‚ÄîSerena didn't believe that was her true colors. Serena's instincts told her Eliza was far from simple.

Eliza bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Mrs. Powell, did I do something to make you misunderstand me?""

She walked over to Serena anxiously. Seeing Serena folding clothes, Eliza quickly reached out and grabbed her hand.

Eliza said, ""Mrs. Powell, if you don't want me to stay, just say it. I can leave. But please don't get the wrong idea about me. I never meant to sabotage your relationship with your family. I really didn't‚Äî""

Serena cut in coldly, ""Let go.""

""I'm begging you, please don't misunderstand me, okay? I'll leave, alright?""

""I said let go.""

Serena had no idea what Eliza was trying to do. Seeing her stubbornly clinging on, Serena yanked her wrist free.

Before Serena could say anything, Eliza, who had been standing just fine, suddenly fell. The hot coffee in her hand spilled onto Serena's skin, instantly turning a large area red.

""Ow!"" Eliza's sharp cry pierced the air.

""What happened?"" Leon and Victor rushed over the moment they heard the noise. The moment they saw the scene in front of them, their expressions suddenly changed.

Victor rushed forward, his eyes tinged red with panic. ""Ellie, are you okay? Are you hurt?""

Eliza raised her hand pitifully. Her delicate skin was now marked with a small red burn. ""Victor, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come today. I upset Mrs. Powell. Please don't blame her.""

Victor turned to glare at Serena, his eyes filled with anger. ""Why did you do this? Ellie's just here to stay for a couple days.

""It was already bad enough how you kept giving her a hard time, but now you actually laid hands on her?""

Instantly blamed for something she didn't do, Serena was shaking with rage, knowing full well she'd just been set up. But her mind went blank. She blurted out the truth, ""She fell on purpose.""

Serena had thought Victor still had some ability to tell right from wrong. But not only did he lack that now, his face darkened even more.

He yelled, ""Serena. How can you be so cruel? Why would Ellie fall on her own for no reason? You did it, just admit it. You've really let me down.""

He scooped Eliza into his arms and rushed to the living room to apply medicine to her burn.

Even Leon pointed at Serena's face and cursed her out, screaming, ""You're such a wretch. I hate you. You're evil and disgusting. You don't deserve to be my mom. Just die already. Stop ruining things between Dad and Eliza.""

Serena shoved him away, her breathing heavy. ""Leon Powell, you little brat, say that again.""

Leon lost his balance and fell to the floor, tears welling up in his eyes. ""You wretch, I don't love you anymore. I hate you."" With that, he took off running.

Serena's fingers trembled. It was the first time she had ever spoken harshly to Leon, but she didn't regret it. She took it as her last lesson to him as his mother.

Just then, a dull pain throbbed on the back of her hand. Serena lowered her eyes and looked at the large burn across it, then laughed.

Eliza had only gotten a few drops on her and Victor was already that worked up. But Serena was hurt far worse, and no one cared.

Serena's throat moved with a deep swallow as she walked alone to the bathroom to run cold water over her hand.

The water was colder than usual, and the twisted, jagged scar in her palm seemed even more noticeable now.

Outside, she heard Leon's cheerful voice. ""Yay. We're going out to eat. Daddy's the best. Ellie's the best too. I wish every day could be like this,"" he laughed.

""Victor, are you sure Mrs. Powell won't be upset we're not taking her?"" Eliza asked.

Victor said, ""She won't be. And even if she is, she'll get over it by the time we're back.""

Serena turned the faucet up to full blast, drowning out their voices from the living room.

After a long while, she suddenly shut off the water with a loud clack and walked straight into the bedroom, her steps firm and unwavering.

Serena thought, 'I'll get over it? No, Victor. You're never going to see me again. I'll let you guys be together.'

# Chapter 4 Misunderstood

""Today was so much fun. Eliza, I want to go again tomorrow,"" Leon said excitedly, tugging Eliza's hand as they walked into the living room.

Eliza reached out to pat Leon's head, her smile bright. ""Of course, Leon. If there's something you want to do, I'll definitely take you. But everything I let you eat today was just the kind of stuff Oliver eats all the time. Nothing special.""

Leon pouted and started complaining, ""My mom never lets me eat those things. Eliza, you don't even know how jealous I am of the other kids. Their moms are way better than her.""

Serena had just come out of the bathroom and heard the entire conversation. She walked down from the second floor, and the moment she looked up, she saw the ketchup still smeared on the corner of Leon's mouth.

Serena asked sharply, ""If you knew I don't let you eat that stuff, why did you still eat it?""

Leon looked up at the sound of her voice. The moment he saw Serena, his face turned sour.

Eliza spoke up, sounding apologetic, ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I didn't know you don't usually let Leon eat that kind of stuff. But it's really no big deal once in a while. Oliver eats it too.""

Serena snorted, ""Fast food is junk‚Äîloaded with fat and salt. It causes weight gain. Leon has a sensitive stomach. What makes you think it's no big deal? Or do you just assume everyone's like you people?""

Eliza's expression stiffened slightly.

Leon shot back, ""I've never eaten fast food before. It's just this once because Eliza brought me along. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Don't take it out on her.""

Leon's automatic defense of Eliza made Serena feel bitterly ironic. After everything Serena had done to take care of him, all it took was one fast food meal from Eliza to win him over.

Eliza explained patiently, ""Mrs. Powell, I understand how you feel as a mom. I'm a mom too. It's normal that kids like fast food. It's not like they eat it all the time.

""Plus, Leon is fine right now. I just think maybe sometimes you don't need to be so strict with him.""

Serena sneered, ""Really? And if something did happen, would you take responsibility?""

""Eliza would never be as stingy as you. Ollie eats this stuff all the time and he's fine. You just can't stand seeing me happy."" With that, Leon wiped his tears angrily and ran upstairs.

Seeing Leon run upstairs, Victor lost his temper and snapped, ""Serena, was it really necessary to blow up over something so small?

""Ellie was just being kind. If you didn't keep telling Leon what he can and can't eat, he wouldn't crave junk food so much.""

They all acted like it was Serena's fault. She didn't bother arguing and turned to leave. She thought, 'Since Victor, as Leon's father, doesn't care, why should I go out of my way to cause trouble for myself?'

Back in her room, Serena packed up her things and thought, 'Just a little longer. Once I get through this, I won't have anything to do with this family ever again.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Early the next morning, just as Serena was waking up, she heard a knock at the door. Before she could respond, the door was already pushed open.

Eliza walked in with a smile, holding a glass of milk. ""Mrs. Powell, Victor took the kids out. He asked me to let you know you don't need to prepare any meals for us today.""

Serena didn't even glance at her. She turned and sat down at the vanity, calmly taking off the bracelet from her wrist.

""I'm not interested in any of that. You don't need to tell me. And Ms. Stone, didn't anyone ever teach you to knock and wait for permission before entering someone else's room?"" Serena remarked.

Eliza's fingers tightened slightly around the glass, her knuckles turning pale. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I wasn't thinking. I just felt like maybe there's been a misunderstanding between us.

""When I had issues with my house, Victor invited me to stay here. I didn't think too much at the time. But don't worry. Once my place is fixed, I'll leave with Oliver right away.""

Serena could hear the provocation in Eliza's words. ""Eliza, there's no one else around right now. You don't need to keep pretending. Do you think that act of yours still works?"" Serena turned and looked her straight in the eye.

""Mrs. Powell, I'm not sure what you mean,"" Eliza said as she sat down on a stool across from her. She set the glass of milk on the table, rested her chin on her right hand, and put on a troubled expression.

She continued, ""I thought you were smart. When you saw me come back, I figured you'd know better and leave.

""I know the Powell family has a lot of money, and you want to stay a bit longer to get a bigger cut. But think about it‚Äîdo you really believe someone like Victor would give you anything?""

Now that Eliza had dropped the act, Serena smirked coldly. She had no interest in the Powell family's money. But now, she was genuinely curious about why Eliza had come back to the country.

Serena asked, ""Eliza, if you chose to leave Victor back then, why come back now? Is it because your ex-husband's broke?""

Eliza's face darkened. Her hand clenched slightly, but after a pause, she let out a breath. ""Serena, stop trying to get a read on me. It won't be long before Vic divorces you. You'd better start thinking about how you're going to live after that.""

As she spoke, the smile on her face grew wider. ""I've only spent a few days with Leon and he already adores me this much. There's no way he'll choose you.""

It felt like a sharp knife stabbed straight into Serena's heart. She thought, 'If even the son I gave birth to prefers another woman, then so be it. I don't want anything anymore.'

Sensing the shift in Serena's emotions, Eliza got an idea. She stood up, walked over, and snatched the emerald bracelet Serena had just put away.

The emerald bracelet was high-quality, clearly expensive, and easily worth millions of dollars. Eliza hadn't expected the Powell family to give Serena something this valuable.

""You're not allowed to touch that."" Serena reached out to take it back, but Eliza dodged her and stepped away.

Eliza turned the emerald bracelet over in her hands, clearly amused. ""So this bracelet's enough to make you lose control. No wonder you're clinging to the Powell family like your life depends on it. Let me help you out.""

Eliza's expression shifted instantly as she suddenly hurled the emerald bracelet to the floor. Even with carpet underfoot, the bracelet still snapped apart.

Serena's expression changed. She rushed over in a panic, picked up the broken emerald bracelet from the floor, and looked it over carefully. Only when she saw that it was still salvageable did she calm down.

With proper jewelry repair, it should be possible to restore it. When Serena returned it later, at least she'd have something to show for it.

Eliza stood there, looking down with open disdain and contempt in her eyes. ""You really are pathetic. Sorry. But since it's already broken, I'll throw it out for you.""

Caught off guard, Serena let Eliza snatch the bracelet away.

The emerald bracelet was only broken into two pieces‚Äîthere was still hope to get it repaired. But if Eliza damaged it further, there would be no way to fix it.

Serena's eyes turned cold as ice. She stepped in front of Eliza at the top of the stairs. ""Eliza, give me the bracelet.""

Eliza glanced toward the front door and heard the sound of Victor returning with the kids.

Just as the door opened, Eliza suddenly grabbed Serena's hand. Tears streamed down Eliza's face, and her voice trembled with sorrow as she said, ""Mrs. Powell, it's all my fault.""",1,1752305630.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúElla, hurry up or you‚Äôre going to be late for school!‚Äù This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it‚Äôs going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven‚Äôt had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it yet, and that‚Äôs the most messed up part. I‚Äôm eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I‚Äôm a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven‚Äôt always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn‚Äôt until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

‚ÄúHoney! Are you coming down or not?‚Äù Once again, my mother‚Äôs voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, ‚ÄúGood morning, daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?‚Äù His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I‚Äôve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don‚Äôt complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

‚ÄúNo, daddy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I‚Äôm a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I‚Äôm not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

‚ÄúThis is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,‚Äù Mom takes her place across from me, on my father‚Äôs other side, as she sips her black coffee, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.‚Äù

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, ‚ÄúBehave, Ethan!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad‚Äôs chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it‚Äôs so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

‚ÄúOh! Before I forget,‚Äù Mom turns back to me, ‚ÄúI have a PTA meeting at Eli‚Äôs school this evening. I‚Äôll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, no problem.‚Äù My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. ‚ÄúWill you be home for supper, dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don‚Äôt make it in time.‚Äù I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it‚Äôs no surprise when he doesn‚Äôt make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, ‚ÄúThe train is leaving!‚Äù I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It‚Äôs the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she‚Äôs a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran‚Äôs song, Shivers, my sister‚Äôs favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can‚Äôt help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it‚Äôs times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I‚Äôm afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I‚Äôll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going, nerd!‚Äù Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù She mimics and then shoves past me, ‚ÄúHow about you accidentally jump off a bridge?‚Äù Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school‚Äôs dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I‚Äôm going to have. Kaylee doesn‚Äôt even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season‚Äôs fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend‚Äôs party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That‚Äôs when it all started; it‚Äôs when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything‚Ä¶you name it‚Ä¶our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn‚Äôt remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn‚Äôt drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn‚Äôt drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn‚Äôt sat well with me, because it wasn‚Äôt like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn‚Äôt find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn‚Äôt heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn‚Äôt want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What‚Äôs one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace‚Äôs bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn‚Äôt until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I‚Äôm so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don‚Äôt bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don‚Äôt.

Watching where I‚Äôm going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I‚Äôm yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I‚Äôm staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, Jace?‚Äù I tried to sound annoyed, but then my voice cracks at the end, giving me away.

‚ÄúWhere have you been hiding all day, Ella?‚Äù He crosses his arms in front of his chest and looks down at me. I stand about eight inches shorter than him, so I‚Äôm always having to look up.

I roll my eyes at him, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt hiding. I just want to get to my classes on time.‚Äù

Next thing I know, Jace‚Äôs broad chest is right in front of my face, ‚ÄúDid you just fucking roll your eyes at me?‚Äù He sneers down at me, making my heart start to race.

Damn, I should have known better than to give him an eyeroll! He warned me last time what would happen, but would he really do it? I glance around the room, trying to find another way that I could possibly escape, and that‚Äôs when I see his two best friends standing only a few feet away, wearing identical smirks. Toby and Brandon are two of the school‚Äôs popular guys, and two of the biggest jerks as well. Jace started hanging with them shortly after he dumped me; what he sees in them, I will never understand. Now, he has become one of them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jace. I didn‚Äôt mean to.‚Äù I dip my head when I see him bring his arm up, thinking he‚Äôs going to strike me. Instead, he grabs my nape and walks me over to the nearest desk.

‚ÄúI told you that you would be punished if you ever rolled your eyes at me, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù He bends me over the desk until my cheek is pressed down against it, ‚ÄúAnswer me, Ella. Did I not warn you?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-Yes, you did Jace, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo buts, Ella. If I don‚Äôt keep my word than you will never obey me.‚Äù He motions for his two friends to come closer, ‚ÄúHold her arms, and make sure she stays in place.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, Jace‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt have to do this!‚Äù I beg, ‚ÄúI promise to obey you from now on‚Ä¶I swear!‚Äù

His hand comes down to caress my hair, ‚ÄúOh Ella, I know you will obey me, because I‚Äôm going to show you what happens when naughty girls don‚Äôt listen.‚Äù His voice is calm as he speaks to me, but then he shoves my head into the desk even more as he moves away to stand behind me.

I can‚Äôt see or hear what Jace is doing behind me, but I can see Toby, who is holding my left arm and shoulder down, nod at whatever his friend is communicating to him. A tear drips from my right eye as I remain bent in this humiliating position while I wait for him to begin. I‚Äôm not sure¬† how much it‚Äôs going to hurt, but I do know that it isn‚Äôt going to feel good either.

I feel the sting of his hand before I even realize it was coming down. I go up on my toes to try and get away from him, but a hand presses into my lower back, keeping me from moving. The spot where is hand met my backside burns already, and that was only the first one.

‚ÄúCount them out, Ella.‚Äù Jace commands, but I‚Äôm still too stunned to say anything. My head gets jerked back by my hair, and he leans in so close to my face that I can see the little golden flecks within the green of his eyes. Something passes as our eyes meet, but it was less than a second, and his eyes harden once more, ‚ÄúI said count!‚Äù

‚ÄúO-One.‚Äù

He holds onto my hair for a few seconds longer before going back behind me. Bringing his hand down once more, I make sure I count each one. I falter on the fifth one because it was harder than the rest, but I quickly call it out. By the tenth smack, my butt is on fire and tingling, as numbness threatens to take over.

‚ÄúWhy Jace? Why do you hate me so much?‚Äù Tears are now falling down full force as I ask the one question that I have never gotten an answer to, ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù I scream when he ignores me and brings his hand down once more.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt answer to you, Ella,‚Äù His breathing is heavy from spanking me so hard, ‚ÄúJust know that you did this, all by yourself!‚Äù His hand comes down in rapid succession, taking whatever aggression he has, out on my poor backside. When I start to scream, a hand covers my mouth, muffling the sound.

All of a sudden, everything stops, and I‚Äôm released, but I don‚Äôt move; I can‚Äôt move. I hear the click of the lock, and then the door closes. Still, I don‚Äôt move. I feel the burn that his hand left behind, but there is something else I feel as well. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm feeling this way after he did what he did. It feels both wrong and good at the same time. Is it normal to feel tingles deep inside? I now feel a need that I‚Äôve only felt a couple of times before; a need that I have had to take care of myself.

A moan slips from my lips as I go to stand, which turns into a grunt when my punished backside bumps up against something. Whipping my head around, Jace is still standing behind me. I can‚Äôt read his face, and at this moment, I don‚Äôt want to. I just want to go home and hide under my covers until I no longer feel the humiliation that Jace and his friends just put me through. I don‚Äôt want to be punished again, though, so I ask before I just leave.

‚ÄúMay I go now?‚Äù I can‚Äôt find it in me to look up at his face any longer, so I bow my head.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not done with you yet, Ella.‚Äù His voice is calm now, even though there isn‚Äôt an ounce of emotion to it, ‚ÄúUnbutton your shorts and bend over the desk again.‚Äù

His words catch my attention, and my head whips up, ‚ÄúW-What?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard me, Ella. I‚Äôm not going to say it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

He cuts me off with a grunt, ‚ÄúYou obviously haven‚Äôt learned your lesson! Maybe a few more handprints will do the trick.‚Äù He spins me back around and pushes between my shoulder blades until my chest is flat on the desk, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking move until I say!‚Äù

The way he orders me to stay scares the crap out of me, so I decide to obey, even though I‚Äôm freaking out at what he‚Äôs going to do, ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt do this, Jace! I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶whatever I did in the past, I‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù I can‚Äôt stop the tears from flowing once more.

I cry out when he yanks my jean shorts down just past my cheeks. Cool air from the air conditioner makes me break out in goosebumps, but it also feels good on my heated backside. I can hear Jace hunting for something in his bag just before I hear the sound of a cap popping open. My eyes widen with what I believe he is getting ready to do, and I try jumping up, but he‚Äôs there to block me.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt listen, do you? I. Said. Don‚Äôt. Fucking. Move!‚Äù He shoves me back down, and this time, he keeps his hand between my shoulder blades. I feel a cold substance dribble on each cheek, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt even be doing this, ‚ÄúHe starts to rub whatever he dripped on me, into my skin, helping to take the heat away, ‚Äúbut I got you good. Next time, obey me, and it will never be this bad.‚Äù

His hands feel good as they massage the gel-like substance into my skin. He‚Äôs being very careful as he switches back and forth from cheek to cheek. His hand then goes lower to where my sit spot is and keeps massaging. I don‚Äôt even think about what he may be able to see, all I can concentrate on is the feel of his big hands on me. I think I may have moaned, because he pauses a moment before I feel his fingers opening my cheeks.

# Chapter 4 Obey Me - Pt. 2

‚ÄúDid you get off on my punishing you, Ella‚Ä¶or are my hands making you all wet?‚Äù

I‚Äôm too embarrassed to say anything, so I just shake my head back and forth. His finger dips between my folds and passes through the slickness a few times before Jace removes it. I hear him groan and then a wet popping sound comes from behind me, where he is standing.

‚ÄúMm‚Ä¶who knew your slutty pussy would taste this good?‚Äù Suddenly, his hand comes down on my already numb butt, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever lie to me again. You got turned on by me spanking you!‚Äù He smirks.

I‚Äôm too scared to move; too afraid that my now really wet area will make a sound when I move, and it‚Äôs the last thing I want him to hear. Thankfully, he takes the initiative and pulls up first, my panties, and then my shorts. I take it as my cue to stand up and button my shorts up, but I refuse to look at him. I can only imagine what I look like after crying while wearing mascara, but he doesn‚Äôt care, he turns me towards him, and gripping my chin, he forces my head up.

‚ÄúDamn, Ella. If I didn‚Äôt despise you so much, I‚Äôd say you look fucking beautiful with your mascara running down your wet face.‚Äù He gazes at me, taking in everything he can before a sadness crosses his handsome features, ‚ÄúI really wish things didn‚Äôt change between us, Ella. You could have experienced so much with me,‚Äù The hardness that I‚Äôm used to seeing takes hold once more, ‚ÄúToo bad I slutty girls don‚Äôt interest me.‚Äù He shoves my head away, and snatching his bag off the desk beside us, he heads towards the door, stopping before he opens it. Looking back over his shoulder, he looks me up and down, before meeting my eyes, ‚ÄúObey me next time, and don‚Äôt ever hide from me, Ella, or next time you will be bared and then punished. You wouldn‚Äôt want my friends to see you like that, now, would you?‚Äù

He actually waits for my answer, so I hurry up and give it, ‚ÄúN-No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, we will see about that. Go home and clean yourself up. You look pathetic.‚Äù

I‚Äôm finally left alone to gather myself together. Moving over to the big sink where the students wash their hands after handling art supplies, I look at myself in the mirror above it, and gasp. I look horrific! Bending over, I quickly wash all the makeup from my face, removing all evidence that Jace made me cry.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Thank God I don‚Äôt have to drive my sister and brother home today, because I don‚Äôt know if I can keep it together being around anyone right now. As I pull into our driveway, I see Jace climbing out of his new jeep that he got for his eighteenth birthday. He smirks at me and then pushes the finger he used on me into his mouth and started sucking on it. I turn and run up the walkway, and into my house. I don‚Äôt stop running until I get to my room, slamming the door closed. I lean against it, panting as I catch my breath, but running all the way up here isn‚Äôt the only reason why I‚Äôm panting. Jace Palmer is what has me trying to get my heart rate down.

What he did to me in that empty classroom was humiliating and shameful, but deep down, I liked it. I liked it even more when his hands rubbed the gel into my heated skin that he caused with his own hand. To make matters worse, his finger almost had me coming all over! He never would have let me live that down. I‚Äôm already worried what he will tell tweedle dee and tweedle dum about what happened after they left the room.

Damn him! Why does he have this effect on me? I never had feelings for him until after he started bullying me. I have been crushing on my bully for two years, and now, he‚Äôs just made it worse. Knowing what his hands feel like when they touch my bare skin, will be burned into my soul forever. What did I ever do to deserve this, and why did he keep calling me slutty? He knew I was still a virgin when we were still friends, and then he went and scared everybody away, so even if I wanted to, there is no one in my age group that I could have lost it to.

I‚Äôm so frustrated! I wish I had someone to talk to, it would be so nice to be able to talk to my two best friends, but he even scared them off! I mean, they don‚Äôt hate and treat me badly like everyone else, if anything they pity me. I can see it in their eyes every time we cross paths, but they are unwilling to anger Jace by talking to me. I don‚Äôt understand how he can make a whole school scared of him.

Sighing, I head to my bathroom ensuite as I start pulling off my clothes. A bath is what I need right now; a bath and some music, because thanks to the bully next door, I have something that needs attention. I‚Äôm just about to step into the tub when I hear my phone ping with a text message. I go back to my room and grab my cell from the bed where I tossed it when I came in. My heart skips a beat when a name that I haven‚Äôt seen in two years, pops up. I open the text and read it, furrowing my brows.

JP: Do Not Touch Yourself!

Another text pops up.

JP: I mean it, Ella! If you touch that pussy, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I say to myself. I happen to glance up, and there is Jace, standing at his bedroom window, staring straight into mine with an anguished look on his face. It takes me a moment, but then I realize that I‚Äôm standing here, completely naked. ‚ÄúOH MY GOD!!‚Äù Ripping the comforter off my bed, I wrap it around myself and then stalk over to the window and pull my curtains closed.

Sweet Jesus! I can‚Äôt believe he saw me naked! He‚Äôs never going to let me live it down, and he will make me the laughingstock at school! Slamming my bathroom door, I drop my comforter and climb into the steaming water. I lower myself slowly, not wanting to hurt my bottom any more than it already is. Once I‚Äôm all the way in, I sigh. The heat from the water relaxes my body as I close my eyes and my thoughts automatically take me back to the classroom, and the spanking that Jace delivered.

‚ÄúWell, if anything, he is a man of his word.‚Äù I say out loud.

My thoughts are beginning to make my body react, and the last thing I need is for Jace to find out that I did what he commanded me not to do. I don‚Äôt think I can handle another punishment so soon after this first one, but where does he get off telling me what I can and can‚Äôt do? He doesn‚Äôt even like me, so what does it matter? Screw this, it is my body, and I am in charge of what I do to it! With that being said, I slowly start sliding my hand over my thigh, moving it up to where I‚Äôm desperately needing it. Just when I‚Äôm about to slide it between my thighs, a voice enters my head, his voice.

‚ÄúUGH!‚Äù Frustrated, I pull my hand away and pull myself up and out of the tub. I now need to find something to occupy my time. ‚ÄúChicken shit,‚Äù I mumble to myself as I dry my body off. Forgetting about my sore bottom, I run the towel over it roughly, cursing as the burn comes back full force. Yep, definitely made the right decision.

# Chapter 5 Our Little Secret - Pt. 1

Over the last couple of weeks, things have been back to normal, well my normal anyway. Jace is back to shoving me against lockers as he walks by or trying to trip me when he passes me in the halls. His two friends shoulder bump me, but that‚Äôs the extent to what they do to me; the rest is all Jace.

I‚Äôm standing at my locker with the door open, reading a text from my mom, when suddenly the door slams shut. It startles me, and I jump back. Kaylee is leaning against the locker next to mine with her arms crossed and a huge smirk on her face. I roll my eyes and go to reopen my locker, but she stops me by slamming her hand against my door.

I sigh heavily, ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Kaylee?‚Äù

‚ÄúA little respect, for one!‚Äù she glares at me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt done anything to you. Believe me, I try to avoid you like the plague.‚Äù I say smugly.

‚ÄúSee! That right there‚Ä¶it‚Äôs disrespectful!‚Äù She points her long, pointed fingernail at me.

‚ÄúYou have to earn respect, Kaylee. You lost my respect when you decided to start treating me like crap for no reason.‚Äù I‚Äôm just so tired of being scared about who will do what to me. I need to start standing up for myself, ‚ÄúSo, again, what do you want? I have a class to get to.‚Äù

She huffs, and then gets right up in my face, ‚ÄúTalk to me like that again, and see where that gets you!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have time for this, so I put on the biggest fake smile for her, ‚ÄúGeesh, I‚Äôm so sorry, Kaylee. To what do I owe the pleasure?‚Äù

She gives me a squinty glare at my sarcasm, ‚ÄúI just wanted to make sure that you were aware of Jace throwing a party at his house tomorrow night, and that you are not invited.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think that I would even want to go to one of his parties?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I just know how both your parents are close friends and they will probably expect you to go.‚Äù She copies my stance.

‚ÄúWhatever, no worries. I definitely will not be there.‚Äù I decide to walk away before I get even more annoyed with the barbie wanna be. I hear her snicker as I pass her, but she doesn‚Äôt stop me. Why would she even think that I would expect to be invited?

‚ÄúHey, Ella‚Ä¶wait up!‚Äù My sister calls out as she jogs up to me, ‚ÄúWhat class do you have next?‚Äù

‚ÄúHistory, why do you ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, just wondering. Are you doing anything this afternoon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot as of right now, unless mom asks, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I was wondering if you could take me to the mall and help me pick an outfit out.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, I will! I love shopping with you.‚Äù I bring her in for a side hug as we walk down the hall.

‚ÄúThank you! I better get going, my class is all the way downstairs.‚Äù She chuckles.

I shake my head in amusement as my sister bounces away.

‚ÄúYour little sister is turning into a hottie.‚Äù My body freezes at the sound of his voice. Spinning around, I come face to face with my bully.

‚ÄúPlease stay away from her.‚Äù I plead.

His hand presses against the middle of his chest, and he gives a fake gasp, ‚ÄúYou hurt my feelings, Ella. I would never do anything to hurt an innocent girl like Elise.‚Äù He leans in, so the other students passing by don‚Äôt hear what he‚Äôs about to say, ‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt you. I‚Äôd never do to her all the things I want to do to you. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt her like I want to hurt you.‚Äù

Even though his words are hurtful, they send a tingle through me, making my core throb. I suck in a breath and take a little step back. When I glance up at his face, there is a look that has replaced the hardness that is usually there. Almost like a look that promises me that he will be doing exactly what he just said. We are only a few inches away from each other, the smell of his cologne tickles my nose. I know the scent well, because it‚Äôs still the same one that he started wearing when we were friends. It‚Äôs the one that I bought him; he‚Äôs never changed it after all this time.

I don‚Äôt dare say anything or try to move away. I wait for him to depart first, and when he gives me a sneer and stomps away, I blow the breath out that I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding in.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

‚ÄúOh my God, that is so cute on you! I think you should definitely go with that one.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been sitting down, flipping through an out-of-date fashion magazine while my sister tries on outfit after outfit. I really don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs not like I have anything else going on in my life. Living vicariously through Elise at least helps me keep up on life outside of home and school.

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù She turns in front of the full-length mirror, trying to decide, ‚ÄúI still think I should go with the green dress.‚Äù

My mouth drops open, ‚ÄúYou mean the one wear your butt cheeks are peeking out of the bottom?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt exaggerate, Ella.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you going out on a date with anyway?‚Äù I slap her hand away as she tries to fold the already small crop top, up so it sits right under her breasts.

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt have a date.‚Äù

I‚Äôm totally confused now, ‚ÄúSo what was this important shopping trip for?‚Äù

Her eyes widen as she looks over at me, ‚ÄúUm, hello! It‚Äôs Jace‚Äôs very first party at his house! Aren‚Äôt you going?‚Äù

She leaves me speechless to where I just stand here gawking at her until she shakes me a bit.

‚ÄúEarth to Ella! Did you hear me?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah, um‚Ä¶but no, I‚Äôm not going.‚Äù I tilt my head at her, ‚ÄúWhy are you going? You never even talk to him.‚Äù

She shrugs, ‚ÄúHe personally invited me this morning.‚Äù Cocking her hip and placing her hand upon it, she scrutinizes me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seriously not going? I mean, you two used to be inseparable and now I never see you guys talk. Is there something going on that you haven‚Äôt told men about?‚Äù

Elise has no idea of the hell that our next-door neighbor puts me through on a daily basis. He makes sure to be on his best behavior when she or any other family member is around. I don‚Äôt want her knowing, but I also don‚Äôt want her going to that party. Nothing good can come from him inviting my little sister; he‚Äôs up to something.

Putting one of my famous fake smiles on, I rub her arm, ‚ÄúThere is nothing to tell. Friends grow apart, and parties are not my thing.‚Äù An idea comes to me, ‚ÄúHey, why don‚Äôt you ditch the party and we can go hit up the next town, maybe check out that new hangout that everybody seems to be crazy about?‚Äù

She scoffs at me, ‚ÄúSeriously? Mom and Dad finally give me permission to go to a high school party, and you think I will pass it up?‚Äù Her head shakes, ‚ÄúUh huh, not doing it.‚Äù

Feeling defeated, I go back to the chair I was sitting in, ‚ÄúIn that case, wear this outfit. I don‚Äôt want any of those buttholes from school trying to feel you up, and they will try.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I will listen to my big sister‚Äôs advice.‚Äù She goes to enter the dressing room but then turns back to me, ‚ÄúI love you, Ella. If there is anything that you need to talk about, I‚Äôm here for you. All of your secrets are safe with me.‚Äù

I smile, ‚ÄúThank you, Elise. Right back at you.‚Äù

She nods her head and sadly smiles back before closing the dressing room door. I need to talk to Jace before that party. I need to know what his plans are with my baby sister. Maybe if I tell her what he‚Äôs been doing to me for the past two years, then she won‚Äôt go. Biting my thumb nail, I contemplate on doing just that. In the end, though, I just can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt tell her how much of a pussy her big sister is because she can‚Äôt stand up to the boy next door.

# Chapter 6 Our Little Secret - Pt. 2

I‚Äôve just finished supper with my family when I excuse myself. I hurry to my room and glance out my window to see if Jace is home. His black jeep is parked in the driveway, so I pick up my cell and type out a quick text.

ME: Can we talk?

Hitting send, I wait. I get nothing back for at least ten minutes, and just when I think he‚Äôs going to ignore me, my phone pings.

JP: Why would I want to talk to you?

ME: Please, it‚Äôs important!

JP: What‚Äôs in it for me?

Seriously? What a douche bag! I sit back, biting my lower lip while I think about what to say. My phone pings again.

JP: I don‚Äôt have all night, Ella. Some of us have a life you know!

ME: Ok‚Ä¶I‚Äôm thinking!

JP: Did you just yell at me?

Oh shoot! What was I thinking?!

ME: No, I promise!

JP: Yelling & lying to me, tsk tsk, You‚Äôre in for it tomorrow.

ME: Please, Jace‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry!

JP: Oh, you‚Äôre going to be sorry! Now, what did you want?

ME: Can we meet up for a minute? It‚Äôs about my sister.

JP: Fine. Come over, but hurry, I have to be somewhere.

ME: Ok, thanks.

He doesn‚Äôt bother to respond back, so I quickly jump from my bed and hurry downstairs. There isn‚Äôt anybody around as I head straight for the door, and I‚Äôm thankful for thank, because then I‚Äôd have to tell them where I‚Äôm going. The last thing I need is my mom telling me to invite Jace over. She used to think of him as a second son and was sad when he stopped coming over.

As I step out the door, I stop for a moment. I‚Äôm about to enter my bully‚Äôs home, what am I thinking? I glance over and see that their garage door is open, and that Mrs. Palmer‚Äôs car is parked in it. I sigh in relief, I should be safe with his mom home, so I quicken my steps, so he doesn‚Äôt get angry at me for taking too long.

I press the doorbell and wait. My heartbeat quickens when the door opens and I see Jace standing there, shirtless. He‚Äôs holding a shirt in his hand, so I must have caught him as he was finishing up getting dressed. He glances up and down the street and then nods for me to come in. Is he embarrassed to have me in his house?

My eyes are still on his bare chest when his hardened voice gets my attention, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you need to talk to me about?‚Äù I almost frown when he slides his shirt over his head but cover it up right away.",1,1752305573.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Oh she said welcome to Lilia‚Äôs bday vlog. My bad.

It‚Äôs not gonna be a big party. Jess wanted her to have a quincea√±era. She‚Äôs having a sonic the hedgehog themed bday party. So quirky. Jess knows nothing about sonic. Decorating 5 second montage. Jess can‚Äôt find any of her balloon blower upper things so she has to use her mouth. Jess is spray painting styrofoam ish rings gold pseudo montage style. 

Lilia is having a chocolate hear me out cake. The cake got jacked up on the car ride si she has to fix it. 

Montage. Someone put Kyson on the hear me out cake and everyone laughs like that‚Äôs not weird as hell. 

Happy bday song. Montage of old photos of Lilia and now we‚Äôre just straight montaging and suddenly we‚Äôre back. Then we‚Äôre back into montaging party stuff.

The next day. Lilia‚Äôs real birthday is tomorrow. Alyssa is going home today. They‚Äôre at the mall and the girls get $100 each to spend at the mall before they have to go to the airport. 

Airport now.

Back home and going back over the 15 gifts for her 15th bday and decorating and wrapping and all that crap. Several Dr Pepper gifts. It‚Äôs weird how her kids like something and she makes it a personality trait.

Montage of decorating we saw on ig and prob tiktok idk I don‚Äôt follow her there. 

It‚Äôs morning again. She‚Äôs ambushed by Jess being way too intense. Montage of gift opening. Her last gift shoes up. It‚Äôs a Hamilton book. She sings Hamilton songs. Now I love Hamilton. I‚Äôve seen it on Broadway twice and I live in Kansas so it was a whole ass trip for me to go. But the Hamilton singing while people are talking is probably my biggest pet peeve on the vlogs when featuring L. Not talking bad about her, I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs bad at it or anything like that, it just irritates me. Maybe because my kids don‚Äôt do that because they were taught not to do that when people are talking but ya know.

Bday lunch time and Lilia wants Chevy‚Äôs. The whole fam came in 2 cars because there is cheer and soccer and stuff. 

They‚Äôre there and eating and only 2 of the kids don‚Äôt count as adults. Jess asks what everyone‚Äôs favorite thing about Lilia.
She‚Äôs nice and funny and asks permission to use things. - Kyson 
Couldn‚Äôt understand Landen.
She makes the best waffles. - Chris
She stays in her room. - Addie 
She gives me money. -Kaden  
She always makes everyone around her feel welcome, loved, and appreciated. - Jess
When she put stickers all over my windows and rhey wouldn‚Äôt come off when she was little. - Chris

Jess asks Addie again wanting a nice answer and she says Lilia‚Äôs friends and she‚Äôs asked a third time and there‚Äôs a cut and then Jess says ‚Äúwhen she makes brownies with you?‚Äù And Addie just keeps eating. üòê

They‚Äôre going diff places. 

Jess is no makeup talking about how she‚Äôs going to be 16 next year then 17 and omg so crazy and that‚Äôs all for these like 3 days and she hopes we have a famtastic day. 

Clickbait spoiler - the 15 gifts for L‚Äôs 15th bday and the balloons and streamers a la sunkissed Pinterest album are only a surprise if you don‚Äôt follow Jess on any social media.

I was surprised there was some footage I hadn‚Äôt seen in there but it was boring. At least we didn‚Äôt have to hear her coo over how cute Honey is in this vlog.

You invited me the moment you opened this page. ‚ÄúInvited who?‚Äù you ask. You‚Äôve been calling to me your entire life. The quiet moments. The angry ones too. When you stared at that door, knowing the consequence, and opened it anyway.

Let me get a good look at you. Ah‚Ä¶ yes. I remember that face. I wore you often. It suits you. I‚Äôm glad you took it back.

They paint me evil with a hypocrite‚Äôs brush. Think I offer bargains? I don‚Äôt. I offer reflections‚Äîones people hate to look at for too long.

I‚Äôm the silence before the gunshot that invaded a Kennedy‚Äôs thoughts. I was the applause when they chose a criminal over Jesus. I‚Äôm the doubt in the hands of the surgeon who had too much coffee.

And so you choose. Again and again.

And I never have to force your hand.

No, my silly. I just offer‚Ä¶ a nudge. Next time you stare at your reflection, say:

‚ÄúI made this choice.‚Äù

And you did. But I was there. I watched your hands hover over the delete key. I remember the hesitation before you pressed it anyway. I heard the lie you told because they trusted you.

You never needed me to commit sin. You just needed someone to blame for enjoying it. So you chose the obvious answer. Then you prayed for forgiveness with every intention of repeating it.

You‚Ä¶ you pray only when it benefits you. Always consistently inconsistent.

Look at you. Eyes wide. Lips parted. Wondering, is this fiction, or confession? Do you feel the toll yet? The guilt for everything YOU did wrong and blamed on me?

Don‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt take anything. You gave it all away ages ago. I just like the moment you realize. When your pulse picks up. When you stop reading this as a story and start wondering if I‚Äôm behind you.

Go on.

Check.

Still here? Good. Thought you did enough to reverse it all?

No, no, no.

I am every unfinished thought. That weird taste after you say something unforgivable. I‚Äôm always, always pleased to see you.

Tell me.

What‚Äôs my name?

Say it.

No?

Then say yours.

It‚Äôs the same.

Now go.

The sun was setting on Rosalie Moreno's life with the Moreno family, and she had hoped for a silent farewell. But as she tiptoed towards the door, ready to vanish into the dusk, Jennifer Moreno, her adoptive mother, summoned her with a voice that cut through the quiet.

In the living room, Yuri Moreno, the family's true daughter, nestled close to Yosef Lennon, the Lennons' indulged scion, on the couch. A pang of realization struck Rosalie‚Äîher presence was surplus.

The Morenos and Lennons had a marriage pact, and Yosef, who'd boasted of claiming Rosalie as his bride since their school days, was now smitten with Yuri, who'd returned only a week ago. It wasn't Rosalie he desired; it was the Moreno name.

Jennifer wasted no time in confirming Rosalie's suspicions. ""Rosalie, can't you see? Yuri and Yosef are a match made in heaven. You and Yosef were never meant to be, but they... they're perfect together.""

""Love can't be forced; it's fate,"" Jennifer continued, her tone softening. ""Don't cling to Yosef out of habit. They'll be engaged before you know it.""

Rosalie raised a skeptical eyebrow. ""Tell that to Yosef. He's the one who can't let go. I've never been interested."" She had seen through Yosef's grand gestures long ago; he was nothing more than a plaything to her.

Yosef, who'd endured Rosalie's disdain for years, harbored a grudge. Seeing her still acting with an air of superiority, even after losing her Moreno status, he sneered, ""You're just a nobody, yet you talk so big.

""No wonder I never liked you. You're a fake! Thank God we weren't engaged. I'd be stuck with you and your replacement!""

Yosef sneered at Rosalie with a look of utter disdain, yet a tinge of regret lingered in his heart. Rosalie's beauty and figure were leagues beyond Yuri's, a fact that was hard to ignore. He thought it was such a shame that Rosalie wasn't the true-born daughter of the Moreno family.

Rosalie's retorted, ""That's what I'm saying! Thank God someone else is taking you off my hands, or I'd have to look at your pockmarked face forever.""

Yosef's face, scarred by acne, twisted in anger at Rosalie's jab.

Yuri, feigning concern at Yosef's mockery, played the peacemaker. ""Yosef, don't be so harsh. She might get hurt. After all, if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have taken you or the Moreno heiress spot from her.

""She's just lashing out because she's hurting inside. Can't you cut her some slack?"" Yuri's voice dripped with false sympathy.

Rosalie wasn't buying it. ""I'm not upset. This loser chased me for years, and I never cared. But you? A week back and you're already with him. Trash and a schemer‚Äîmade for each other!""

Jennifer exploded at that, ""You heartless girl! Why are you so rude? No wonder I could never get close to you; you're naturally disrespectful.

""You lived a life of luxury for eighteen years while Yuri suffered. And now you insult her? That's outrageous!""

Rosalie, reprimanded by Jennifer, remained unflustered. Everything she had with the Moreno family, she'd earned through her secret contributions to the family's business.

Curtis Moreno, Rosalie's adoptive father, had saved enough to start a factory but lacked the business acumen to keep it afloat.

Without Rosalie's secret help, the factory would have folded, and the Moreno family wouldn't have become one of Serenity District's top merchants. But Rosalie never bragged; they were clueless about her role as the factory's biggest backer.

Curtis, dragged into the downstairs fray, frowned on purpose, playing the peacemaker.

Curtis pretended to blame Jennifer. ""Come on, that's not how you talk to Rosalie. She's going back to her family today, facing tough times. Besides, we messed up eighteen years ago; it's not her fault. Can't let her leave broken-hearted, right?""

Curtis, though hypocritical, had a fair point. But looking at Rosalie, his feelings were mixed.

He loved Rosalie since she was a kid‚Äîcharming and lovely. But if she hadn't been with them, they wouldn't have missed their real daughter for eighteen years, suffering away from home.

Curtis let out a sigh as he spoke to Rosalie. ""Rosalie, you're not my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. You're like my own kid.""

""I've done some checking. Your real folks are out of work. If you ever need something, don't hesitate to come back and ask for help,"" Curtis added, feigning kindness.

Jennifer, sitting close by, jumped up and nudged Curtis. ""Why are you being so generous? Watch out you don't end up with a freeloader! Parents without jobs‚Äîwhat kind of decent family is that?""

Rosalie looked at the Morenos' fake smiles and Yosef, her face blank as she said, ""No thanks, Mr. Moreno. But you might want to focus more on running the factory and the company, especially keep an eye on the people around you.""

Rosalie glanced at Jennifer, a hint of warning in her voice.

There was a real snake in the grass at the company. Jennifer and her brother had been siphoning off money for years. If Rosalie hadn't been watching them, they might have bled the company dry.

If her birth family was really struggling, Rosalie figured she wouldn't have time to deal with the Morenos' drama.

Jennifer exploded at her words, ""So you can't stand to see us doing well, can you? Even as you're leaving, you have to curse our business. Like you've ever managed the factory! What are you even bragging about?""

Rosalie knew arguing with Jennifer was a waste of time, so she just snorted, ""You'll see what I'm capable of soon enough.""

Not wanting to waste any more breath, Rosalie stood up, slung her only backpack over her shoulder, and headed for the door. Inside was just her ID and the laptop she'd bought herself. She wasn't taking anything else.

But Yosef had to get in his digs. ""Mr. and Mrs. Moreno, Rosalie didn't even bring her luggage. Who knows what valuables she's got in that bag. You'd better check it!""

Jennifer, taking the bait, immediately said, ""Yosef's right! Open it up and see what's inside!""

# Chapter 2 The Enigmatic Ride

Yuri feigned concern with a practiced sigh. ""Mother, is this truly necessary? Rosalie's family is in dire straits. Even if she took a trinket or two, it's but a drop in the ocean for us. Can't we show some compassion?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Everything in her room was a gift from us. How dare she use our generosity to sustain her family? Her parents, jobless and adrift‚Äîwill a few baubles truly make a difference?""

As she spoke, Jennifer advanced on Rosalie's backpack, intent on exposing her supposed thievery.

Rosalie, anticipating Jennifer's petty invasion, unzipped her bag with a flourish. ""Here, see for yourselves. No Moreno trinkets grace this bag. My ID is my own, and the laptop and clothes I wear were bought with the money I earned from my scholarship.""

If Rosalie hadn't been funneling her earnings to support her family, she would have flaunted her wealth in their faces. But they weren't worth the satisfaction.

Seeing the backpack's contents, Yuri and Yosef exchanged glances of disappointment. They hadn't expected Rosalie to have such integrity.

As the Morenos stood speechless, Rosalie slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to make her exit.

Suddenly, a frail figure descended the stairs with urgency. ""Rosalie... wait for me...""

The Morenos whirled in shock to see Yancy Moreno, fresh from surgery, hastening down the stairs.

Jennifer rushed to support her son, her voice laced with panic. ""Yancy, you should be resting! Why have you left your bed?""

Yancy, battling severe aplastic anemia, had undergone a bone marrow transplant by a mysterious doctor. Though the surgery was successful, he was still fragile, needing to avoid stress and exertion. They had kept him from Rosalie, but he defied their wishes.

Rosalie's heart, usually encased in ice, wavered at the sight of Yancy, the one who had always been weak yet her staunch protector.

At that moment, Yancy glared at Jennifer, his voice sharp. ""If you hadn't confined me, I wouldn't have had to rush."" The butler, under orders, had barred his way, but Yancy had slipped past. Luckily, Rosalie was still within reach.

Without delay, Yancy produced a card and pressed it into Rosalie's hand. ""Rosalie, I've heard about your family's plight. I've set aside some savings over the years. Please, take this, should you find yourself in need.""

Holding the card, Rosalie felt a warmth in her chest. In a family of strangers, Yancy was the only one who truly cared. It made all her efforts‚Äîresearching his illness, ensuring his surgery's success‚Äîworthwhile. Now, as she left, Yancy was her only concern.

Seeing Yancy's generosity, Jennifer's face pinched with anxiety. ""You foolish boy, that's your only card, with at least ten grand in it! Why give it to her? She's not even your real sister!""

Yuri, feigning innocence, couldn't help but worry. ""Wow, Yancy is so generous to Rosalie. I've been home for days, and he hasn't even spoken to me much.""

Yosef, sensing Yuri's slight, immediately defended her. ""Come on, man, that's just too biased! You're so cold to your own sister, yet you lavish attention on that impostor.""

""You!"" Yancy fumed, his anger palpable.

Seeing Yancy upset, Rosalie's eyes darkened. She snatched a glass of water and splashed it directly in Yosef's face.

""Hey! Rosalie! How dare you!"" Yosef, heir to the Lennon family, had never been so humiliated, and he shouted in rage.

But Rosalie's gaze was icy. ""Yosef, this is the Moreno residence. Who are you to yell at the head of the Moreno family? Yancy just had surgery and can't afford the stress. Watch your tongue!""

Yosef, used to leveraging his family's friendship with the Morenos, often lingered at their home. Initially to pester Rosalie, he had lately shamelessly attached himself to Yuri, growing presumptuous, even daring to disrespect Yancy. He truly overstepped.

Realizing his blunder and noting the displeasure on Curtis and Jennifer's faces, Yosef retreated.

Yuri seized the moment to stir trouble. ""Mother, Father, even if it's to defend Yancy, Rosalie's actions were outrageous. Splashing water on guests? That's beyond rude.""

Rosalie, unwilling to waste more breath on them, handed the card back to Yancy. ""Yancy, your health comes first. Use this for your supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Rosalie..."" Yancy tried to resist, but Rosalie's grip was firm. He couldn't break free.

Rosalie smiled sincerely at Yancy, ""I appreciate the thought, but Yancy, don't worry about me. I don't need money. It's you who needs to take care of your health when I'm gone."" With that, she released his hand.

Yancy, still worried, tried to insist, but Rosalie was already walking away with a casual stride.

Yosef, grumbling to himself, ""Not short on money? Even now, still pretending to be rich. Rosalie, you really know how to play the part!"" He had harbored this complaint for years and finally let it slip.

Yet, Yosef felt a twinge of discomfort. Rosalie's parting gesture‚Äîsplashing water on him‚Äîleft him feeling frustrated and exposed.

Seeing Yosef drenched, Yuri quickly offered a handkerchief to dry him off.

Jennifer, spying the card back in Yancy's possession, quickly snatched it. ""Thank goodness she had the decency to refuse. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.""

Outside, Rosalie noted the Moreno family's driver made no move to offer her a ride, so she decided to call an Uber. To her surprise, a sleek black sports car, its brand discreet yet its presence commanding, pulled up just then.

Though the car's logo was subtle, the engine's purr betrayed its exclusivity. Under the sunlight, the black paint gleamed with a brilliance that hinted at hidden luxury.

A glance at the tires and rims confirmed their high-end origins. This car was no ordinary vehicle; it was a custom creation by a wealthy individual, likely as valuable as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Rosalie assumed an important figure had arrived. But to her astonishment, the man who emerged was shabby, with dark circles under his eyes.

He appeared no more than a few years older than her, yet his unshaven face and disheveled appearance contrasted starkly with his bright, piercing eyes. Upon seeing Rosalie, his eyes widened in recognition. ""You must be Rosalie?""

# Chapter 3 The Yoder Arrival

The man who stepped out of the unmarked luxury sports car was none other than Rosalie's biological brother, Zaki Yoder. His eyes widened at the sight of Rosalie, and he exclaimed, ""You and Mom... you two could pass for sisters.""

The Yoder family had planned for someone to collect Rosalie today. Zaki, having just wrapped up a high-stakes case, was on his way home for a much-needed break and decided to make a detour to pick up his long-lost sister.

He had half-expected to have to ask the Morenos to point out Rosalie, but the moment he saw her, he knew without a doubt that she was his sister.

Rosalie raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on her face. ""You're my brother?""

""Indeed, I'm Zaki, your third brother,"" Zaki replied, stepping forward with a grin.

Then, a realization struck him. Glancing down, he remembered he had been tailing a drug lord for days, without sleep or a change of clothes, and he had come straight here. Exhausted, he had forgotten to stop and grab a fancy suit to make a good impression.

""Sorry, I was in a rush and forgot to change,"" Zaki said, the tough commander feeling oddly self-conscious for the first time in front of Rosalie.

Rosalie was about to dismiss it as no big deal when Yuri interjected from behind her, ""Oh my, where'd this vagrant come from? Security, why are you letting just anyone in?""

The Moreno family's gatekeeper hurried over, explaining, ""Miss, this gentleman claimed he was here to see Rosalie, so I let him through.""

Yuri feigned surprise and turned to Rosalie. ""Oh... Rosalie, I had no idea he is your family. Please disregard my earlier comment.""

Rosalie gave Yuri the cold shoulder. ""If you're truly sorry, the best thing you can do is be quiet. No one wants to hear your incessant chatter."" With that, she walked past, opened Zaki's car door, and tossed her bag inside.

At that moment, Yosef arrived, seeking to settle a score. Seeing Zaki's beat-up car without a logo, he smirked. ""Never seen a car without a brand. Did you put this together yourself?""

Zaki leaned against the car, worn out, and replied, ""Yeah, it's custom."" They were a special forces team, and they all drove modified vehicles, especially this one, designed by his fifth brother, Kenneth Yoder.

Kenneth was still in school, but he was already a prodigy in weapon design for the Defense Department. His creations, once tweaked, were incredibly powerful and unmatched.

These cars could save a life in a tight spot. So, this car was worth more than any luxury car out there, and it hadn't come cheap.

But Yosef didn't understand and continued to mock Rosalie. ""I can't believe your family even has a car, but without a logo, who knows if it's stolen.""

Yuri chimed in, feigning concern, ""Rosalie, you should be careful. You could get entangled in some legal trouble!""

Rosalie had had enough of their nonsense, and now they were insulting her family. They had reached her limit.

Before Rosalie could speak, Zaki's face darkened. He strode over to them, his imposing figure over six feet tall as he towered over Yosef. Placing a heavy hand on Yosef's shoulder, Zaki said, ""Kid, you can't just run your mouth. Didn't anyone teach you that?""

After years of rigorous training and interrogating criminals, Zaki had earned the nickname ""Ice King."" His glare suggested Yosef might wet himself. Never had Yosef seen someone so intimidating. Yosef stammered, ""I-I-I was just guessing.""

Zaki snorted, ""Guessing? Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a price for every word. If your folks didn't teach you that, I can."" As he spoke, he squeezed Yosef's shoulder a bit harder.

In an instant, Yosef's shoulder popped out of its socket. He felt his arm go limp and screamed, ""Ouch! I won't do it again! Please, let me go!""

Zaki finally eased up, coldly putting Yosef's arm back in place.

Yosef was too terrified to utter a word.

Yuri, standing nearby, didn't fully grasp what had happened, but Yosef was pale as a ghost from the pain.

Zaki glanced at Yuri, causing her to shiver. His stare was absolutely terrifying.

""Young lady, I don't hit women. I'll let you slide today, but watch your mouth next time. I won't tolerate anyone cursing my family,"" Zaki said coldly.

Terrified, Yuri could only nod.

Zaki dialed back the intimidating aura and turned to Rosalie with a grin. ""Hey Rosalie, let's bounce.""

Rosalie gazed at Zaki's grin, seeing a totally different guy from the tough character he'd just played. She knew Zaki was definitely not someone to mess with.

Since he'd already shown Yosef and Yuri who was boss, Rosalie decided to play it cool. ""Alright, Zaki."" With that, she hopped into the car cheerfully.

Zaki, not thinking much of it, agreed, slid into the driver's seat, buckled up, and drove off from the Moreno residence. All that was left were Yuri and Yosef, staring in shock as the car vanished into the distance.

""Who is that guy really..."" Yosef muttered, feeling his arm had healed, but the fear from moments before still lingered in his heart.

Yuri shook her head. ""I don't know either, but the license plate seemed to be from Janivelle. And it looked like a police plate too."" It was puzzling; Zaki looked so scruffy, and yet he was driving a police car from Janivelle.

""You must have seen it wrong,"" Yosef shook his head. He had been too scared to notice those details, but he was sure she must have missed it.

Rosalie's original family was supposedly all out of work‚Äîthere was no way that they could afford a car with Janivelle plates. After all, only locals could use Janivelle license plates.

Getting a residency permit in Janivelle was not something just anyone could do. Even with all the Moreno family's money, they still had out-of-town plates. They bet Rosalie's family must be really poor; there was no way they were locals from Janivelle.

# Chapter 4 Her Family Is Super Loaded

In the car, Zaki felt a bit awkward and said to Rosalie, ""Sorry, Rosalie, I was in such a rush I forgot to bring a change of clothes. I'm a bit messy, and now people are talking about you because of me.""

Zaki really didn't care about what he wore or used, but he couldn't afford to embarrass Rosalie.

Rosalie shook her head understandingly. ""It's fine, as long as the clothes are comfy.""

Zaki felt a bit warmer towards Rosalie. But when he noticed she only had one backpack, he couldn't help but ask, ""Rosalie, didn't you bring any luggage? Just this one bag?""

Rosalie nodded, her tone cool. ""I don't want anything from the Moreno family.""

Zaki, being good at reading people, noticed the displeasure in Rosalie's tone, and his gaze cooled a bit. He quickly said, ""It's alright. Once we're home, anything you need, I will buy for you.""

Rosalie gave a gentle smile. ""Okay."" No matter what her family's real situation was, at least Zaki genuinely cared for her.

Rosalie noticed the route Zaki was taking and couldn't help but ask, ""Zaki, isn't this road leading to Oceanside Manor?""

Oceanside Manor was home to the wealthiest and most influential people in Janivelle. The manor was huge, almost taking up the whole East District. As people went up the hill, they passed by groups of big mansions and a few fancy estates.

Even though the Moreno family moved to Janivelle not too long ago, they had already figured out their main goal was to get close to the ten ancient families of Janivelle, all gathered in the East District.

Unfortunately, the road leading to the hill was lined with checkpoints. Without an invitation from a property owner within the mansion district, entry to Oceanside Manor was not allowed.

However, their car paused briefly at a checkpoint, the license plate was identified, and they were immediately granted access.

Zaki casually replied, ""Yeah, Mom and Dad are waiting for you at home.""

Rosalie couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the fact‚Äîher house was actually in Oceanside Manor.

At this moment, Rosalie started to question Curtis's investigation. Curtis had said that her parents and brothers were all unemployed. If that was the case, there was no way that her family could live in Oceanside Manor.

Rosalie frowned, thinking, 'Curtis has always been unreliable in getting things done. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to manage the company behind the scenes. He probably assumed they were unemployed and jumped to conclusions.

'But that's fine. Since my family is quite well-off, I don't need to worry about supporting them anymore.'

As they drove past several small villas, she thought the car would stop, but it didn't. When she saw a large villa, she couldn't help but think, 'It seems like my family is richer than I thought.'

Yet Zaki's car continued for another ten minutes, exiting the villa area and heading straight into the manor district. Rosalie narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'It seems my new home is exceptionally wealthy!'

But just as she was settling into her thoughts, the car kept going. It eventually drove all the way to the top of the mountain.

Oceanside Manor was named so because the road at its peak had no barriers, and clear seas stretch out on both sides.

At the end of this road, there was just one mega mansion. This was also a landmark people can spot from downtown Janivelle, the Skyline Castle.

It was a landmark because Skyline Castle sat at the peak of Janivelle, and people can spot this castle-like building from way off in the city center.

This place was said to be personally managed by a world-class designer, making it a super luxurious and modern landmark.

Inside this grand castle, people can catch the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most beautiful sunset over the sea at night, which was why it was named after this stunning view.

The owner of this place was a mystery. It was rumored that even the ten most prestigious families in Janivelle couldn't touch them. Yet, no one really knew who owned Skyline Castle.

They say the owner was incredibly wealthy, with investments all over the place. But they didn't run a family business; instead, top managers and stewards handled everything.

So, this mansion's owner had never shown their face, and nobody knew the true identity of their family members.

Just when Rosalie thought Zaki was just showing her the view and would soon head to another villa area, Zaki surprised her by driving straight into this museum-like estate.

In the sunlight, the fountain at the center of the estate splashed water in all directions, reflecting bright rays. The sculpture in the middle was actually a masterpiece by a famous modern artist, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Rosalie, who was used to appraising valuable artifacts, thought the sculpture was truly exceptional.

At this moment, Zaki's car slowly stopped at the front entrance of the castle. Before Rosalie could gather her thoughts, Zaki got out and, with a gentlemanly flair, opened her door. ""Welcome home, Rosalie.""

As soon as he finished speaking, over twenty servants lined up on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison and said, ""Welcome home!""

For a moment, Rosalie felt like she had stepped onto a movie set.

""Zaki... Is this... my house? Really?"" Even though Rosalie wasn't short on money and had seen plenty of influential people, she was still a bit shocked.

After all, she was prepared for her family to be broke, with her parents and siblings all jobless, relying on her to support them. She never expected a complete turnaround. Her family turned out to be the legendary top-tier mysterious billionaires of Janivelle.

# Chapter 5 Back Home

Zaki looked at Rosalie's somewhat surprised expression and smiled warmly, ""Yes, this is your home. Go on in, Mom and Dad are waiting for you.""

Rosalie composed herself and got out of the car, glancing at the extravagant red carpet beneath her feet, feeling a bit awkward as she walked up. ""Isn't this a bit too much?""

Zaki smiled, ""It's important."" After all, Rosalie had been through so many hardships over the years. Her first time home should be celebrated.

While they were speaking, two figures dashed out from the grand doors at the end of the red carpet. ""Is that Rosalie?!"" A voice filled with excitement and melody called out.

Rosalie looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple dress, yet she was elegant and ladylike. Although she was over forty, she maintained herself very well, resembling a famous actress, gentle and charming.

Beside the woman was a charismatic middle-aged man, standing tall and handsome, looking very much like Zaki. Rosalie could immediately tell that this couple must be her parents.

They were looking like a wealthy couple, having nothing related to the broke couple Curtis had mentioned.

At this moment, Roxanne Yoder had already reached Rosalie, grabbing her hand with tears in her eyes. ""That's it... this is truly my daughter. Zachary, look at how much she looks like me, right?""

Zachary Yoder was equally surprised as he looked at Rosalie and Roxanne's strikingly similar faces and agreed, ""Yeah, she really looks a lot like you.""

Roxanne was once an internationally renowned superstar, known for her stunning and unique beauty.

Initially, no one suspected their daughter Xyliana Yoder had been switched at birth. But when puberty hit, and Xyliana started to look less like Roxanne and Zachary, people began to whisper, and they felt something was wrong.

They didn't expect that shortly into their investigation, the Moreno family would discover the mistaken swap, and the police confirmed it with DNA tests between them and Rosalie, finally confirming Rosalie was indeed their biological daughter.

Initially, they planned to conduct a DNA test after Rosalie returned home, but now it seemed unnecessary. Rosalie looked exactly like a younger version of Roxanne, without any makeup, yet she exuded breathtaking beauty and pure charm.

Rosalie couldn't believe how much she looked like her mother either.

Jennifer had always kept Rosalie at arm's length because she was cute and pretty from a young age, and as she grew, she became stunningly beautiful.

Jennifer even wondered if Rosalie was really her own daughter. Driven by these doubts, Jennifer started investigating, and to her surprise, her suspicions were confirmed.

Rosalie felt that she truly found her biological parents.

""Dad, Mom, the wind is strong outside, let's go inside and talk."" Being at a seaside mansion, the sea breeze was indeed strong. Zaki gently reminded Roxanne, worried she might catch a cold.

Roxanne nodded excitedly. ""Yes, yes, I was so excited I forgot! Let's go in,"" she said, grabbing Rosalie's hand as they walked inside.

Rosalie felt Roxanne's soft and warm hand, and a wave of warmth spread through her heart. Having been resented by Jennifer since childhood, Rosalie rarely experienced a mother's care and love. Now she could finally feel just how comforting her mother's warmth was.

They walked in together. First, they went through the foyer. Even though it was just a small entrance hall, it felt like an art gallery, with walls covered in paintings, and in front of them, various pottery and sculptural artworks were displayed.

As Rosalie passed by one of the pottery pieces, she paused for a moment. She pondered, 'This piece of art looks so familiar.'

Noticing Rosalie's gaze, Roxanne quickly asked, ""Rosalie, do you like this artwork?""

Rosalie paused for a moment, feeling awkward, and just nodded. She replied in her heart, 'Of course, I like it. I made it.'

However, with so many artworks she finished each month, she usually just packed them up and had her assistant take them to her art studio to sell.

This particular piece only took her three hours at most to finish. She never thought it would end up at her parents' house.

Roxanne said, ""If you like it, feel free to put it in your room. It's the masterpiece of a mysterious new artist. I bought it a month ago at a charity auction for 3 million dollars. It wasn't expensive, but it's quite creative.""

Hearing this, Rosalie's lips twitched, thinking, '3 million dollars, and it is not expensive?'

Although the Moreno family was among the top three wealthy families in Serenity District, they couldn't just easily spend 3 million dollars on such a small piece of art. And it was something Rosalie created on a whim. She couldn't help but guess how rich her family was.

They all moved to the main hall, where several servants were lined up on either side.

Ten of them were holding trays with various drinks. Even the coffee had several types, while another group carried assorted snacks.

Roxanne walked by with Rosalie and said softly, ""Since it's your first time home, I didn't know what you like to drink, so we made all sorts of coffee. We've also got a variety of juices. Just choose what you like.

""And over here are the pastries from Janivelle's best bakeries. I got one of each flavor for you to taste, so feel free to try them.""

Seeing Roxanne's eager eyes, Rosalie had to choose a cup of freshly ground coffee and two pastries. ""I don't like it too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors are just perfect.""

Roxanne was immediately overjoyed. ""I never would have guessed that our tastes are so similar.""

The selected servant brought the pastries, while the others left.

Zaki then said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to change my clothes.""

Zachary looked at Zaki's messy appearance and sighed, ""You're now the leader of Special Unit A of Interpol! What kind of case would make you personally lead a team to such an extent? If I'd known you looked like this, I wouldn't have sent you to pick up Rosalie. What if you scared her?""

Zaki felt embarrassed. ""We were capturing an international drug lord this time. It wasn't just me; even the deputy chief personally led the operation.""",1,1752304999.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Amber Chase arrived at the hilltop mansion breathless, realizing the party had already begun without her.

The doorman looked surprised to see her. ""Miss Chase, what are you doing here? Everyone's already finished dinner...""

Her husband's birthday celebration, yet they'd forgotten to include his wife. Among all the guests from their social circle, not a single person had bothered to notify her.

She smiled at the doorman and was about to push open the door when she overheard a conversation from inside:

""Victoria, what gift did you bring? Blake has been eyeing your gift bag for half the evening.""

""Have I?""

""You haven't even opened it yet, but you've been eyeing that bag so hard you're practically drilling holes in it! Since Victoria's finally back from overseas, you should just dump Amber already. She totally kills the vibe.""

""For real! She drugged you and jumped into your bed. If you hadn't gone all soft and worried about her reputation by making her your wife, she'd be toast by now. Everyone would've ripped her to shreds.""

The man sitting in the center wore a crisp dark suit with the top two buttons of his shirt undone. His features were striking and aggressive, with naturally deep-set eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. Like a brilliantly poisonous butterfly, his slightly upturned eyes carried a distant, aloof arrogance.

""No rush,"" he said coolly.

""Blake, it's been three years and you're still not in a hurry? Back then, she caused Victoria's sister to become a vegetative patient. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would have destroyed her long ago.""

Blake Westwood's elegant fingers played with a lighter in his hand as he caught a glimpse of a shadow at the doorway.

Only then did the group notice that Amber had been standing there for who knows how long.

Someone whispered, ""Who invited her?""

No one answered. Clearly, she had come uninvited.

Amber lowered her lashes. She had a delicate, cool beauty with an oval face and wore a light cashmere sweater. Her forehead was framed by hair gently tucked behind her ears. Just looking at that innocent face, nobody would believe she could pull off such shameless stunts, but she definitely did all that stuff.

She clutched a gift in her hands and looked toward Blake sitting at the center. Her chest felt as if it were bound by wire, the pain penetrating deeply, making her fingers clench tightly.

She walked to his side, but before she could offer her carefully prepared gift, she saw him slightly furrow his brow and casually mock her: ""Who invited you?""

Laughter erupted around them, shattering what remained of her pride.

Victoria, standing nearby, gave Blake a reproachful glance before pulling Amber to sit down. ""She's still your wife. It's only right for her to bring you a gift. Amber, sit down. Blake just has a terrible temperament.""

Amber pressed her lips together without speaking. She was his wife, yet needed his ex-fianc√©e to smooth things over. No one here welcomed her, but she had come anyway, just because when he was eighteen, he had promised they would celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.

She deliberately sat next to Blake, displacing Victoria.

Victoria's expression faltered momentarily before becoming somewhat unpleasant. Then she asked, ""What gift did you bring for Blake?""

A mischievous guest immediately opened it, revealing a scarf without tags that appeared handmade.

Victoria's voice rose again, ""Oh my! We must be connected somehow‚ÄîI also brought Blake a scarf.""

The two scarves now sat side by side, both handmade, with no discernible difference in craftsmanship.

Someone accidentally bumped the table, causing an open bottle of wine to spill toward both scarves.

Blake reached out and took one of them, while the other became soaked with wine and reeked of alcohol.

He had taken Victoria's scarf.

Seeing the scarf she had knitted for two months soaking in wine, Amber's face turned pale for reasons she couldn't explain, her heart feeling both numb and dull.

Victoria sighed, sympathetically linking arms with her. ""Amber, don't be upset. This one can still be used after washing.""

Amber still didn't respond, instead looking toward Blake.

He kept his lashes lowered, hiding the emotions in his eyes.

The atmosphere got super awkward, with Amber basically crashing what was supposed to be a fun celebration. Everyone started making excuses to leave.

She just sat there motionless, staring at the scarf abandoned on the coffee table, discarded just like her.

As others gradually left, she fixed her gaze on Blake, who was also about to stand. ""Blake, happy birthday,"" she said softly.

Blake acted as if he hadn't heard. When he was twenty-one, he had just been reunited with the Westwood family. By then, he was already a self-made business prodigy with nineteen-year-old Amber by his side.

Seven years later, the business prodigy had become a titan at the center of power, but any feelings between them had long since vanished.

Those difficult early days of struggling together in obscurity now seemed like another lifetime.

Blake had Victoria escorted home.

Victoria reached out and lightly touched his shoulder. ""Talk things through with her. Don't keep fighting.""

Someone scoffed quietly, ""Victoria, you're too kind-hearted.""

""I'm not kind-hearted. I just think the young Amber didn't know any better back then. I'm sure she didn't mean it.""

""Bullshit. She ruined someone's life and shamelessly stole your place. How dare she show her face again.""

Their voices were filled with disgust, growing fainter as they left.

Amber sat motionless, as if paralyzed, every drop of blood running cold, her lips losing their color.

She stood up, grabbed the soaked scarf, and looked at Blake.

""Blake.""

Her voice was gentle as she called his name.

Blake had already draped his suit jacket over his arm. Hearing her, he loosened his tie slightly without looking at her, his brow visibly irritated. ""What now?""

She smiled faintly, her beautiful lips forming the words: ""Let's get divorced, Blake.""

Surprise flashed in his eyes, quickly replaced by layered malice in his expression. ""What new game is this? First you drug me to get me to sleep with you, and now you're acting noble and asking for divorce? Aren't you tired of these tactics, Amber?""

""I'm sorry for wasting three years of your life, but I'm serious this time.""

Blake's mocking expression disappeared inch by inch as he yanked her close, his fingers digging into her chin. Seeing her wince in pain somehow eased his unexplainable frustration. ""Now you're talking about wasting time? Where the hell were you three years ago? Listen up, Amber‚Äîyou want a divorce? Fine! But you won't see a single fucking penny from me!""

""I'll leave with nothing.""

Her eyes were clear, her voice still calm and untainted.

After the Westwoods finally tracked down Blake, they promptly adopted Amber‚Äîwho'd been by his side‚Äîas their goddaughter. Everyone knew exactly what they were doing: the family didn't want their precious second-in-line, the backup heir to the Westwood fortune, marrying some nobody with an ordinary background, so they gave her this goddaughter status to shut people up.

Blake stared at her cool face, his throat working silently as he turned away.

""Fine. Nothing. Don't regret it.""

Chapter 2

Outside, rain had begun to fall without anyone noticing. The mansion was on a hilltop in the suburbs, making it difficult to get a taxi.

The others had already left in their cars. Amber, who had arrived by taxi, was now the last one remaining. She stood under the eaves, watching the drizzle.

A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain and stopped in front of her. The window lowered, revealing Blake's assistant's face‚ÄîDevon Ward.

""Mrs. Westwood, please get in.""

Amber remained standing, her gaze penetrating the car window crack, seeming to know someone else sat inside.

She didn't speak, and Blake's voice rose from within.

""Drive. Let her cool off out here.""

Devon looked uncomfortable but had no choice. He drove away.

Amber watched the car leave, blinking as raindrops drifted in and landed on her face, their coolness penetrating to her marrow.

At eighteen, Blake had looked forward to celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday with her, but at twenty-eight, he thoroughly despised her.

During these three years, he hadn't touched her once, had barely even come home.

Society gossips said she was the most pitiful among all the women who had married into powerful families. All she had was a beautiful cage and nothing else.

In everyone's eyes, she was the villain who had caused Victoria's sister Sophia to become a vegetative patient and then stolen Victoria's fianc√©. She deserved universal contempt.

But no one seemed to remember that from age twelve to nineteen, she had accompanied him from his lowest point to his rise to prominence.

Everyone said the Westwoods had already done her a huge favor with that goddaughter title, but she still wasn't satisfied‚Äîusing those seven years together to emotionally blackmail Blake for life.

Another seven years had passed. All told, she had been by Blake's side for fourteen years.

She lowered her lashes, staring at the rideshare request on her phone. Still no drivers willing to accept the trip.

By the time she returned to River Haven, it was already two in the morning. Her skirt was soaked, clinging to her ankles. In the deep autumn night, it was so cold her lips trembled slightly.

Lights were still on inside the mansion. As she changed her shoes in the entryway, she saw the man sitting on the sofa handling business documents.

Blake's bone structure was exceptional. No matter how long one looked at him, his appearance remained stunning and captivating.

Sitting there, he resembled an unattainable snow-capped mountain.

Amber certainly didn't think he was waiting for her. Three years ago, they had completely fallen out, and she had transformed from a once-bright young woman into someone who barely recognized the shrew she saw in the mirror.

She quietly changed her shoes, tossed the scarf into the garbage bin by the door, and went upstairs.

The master bedroom contained many of her things, kept clean and cozy, since Blake had rarely returned home in the past three years. Everyone mocked her for living as a married single woman.

She pulled out a small suitcase and packed some of her regularly worn clothes. As for the wall of luxury bags and jewelry, she had never touched them.

Blake had said she wasn't worthy.

In his eyes, she was a gold-digger. Placing luxury items in front of her but forbidding her to use them was his form of torture.

Amber came downstairs with her suitcase and placed the signed divorce agreement on the coffee table.

""Blake, I've signed it.""

During these three years, they fought whenever they met‚Äîmore accurately, she would unilaterally accuse him of coldness, desperately trying to get his attention like a madwoman. He would stand silently, watching her lose control with a detached, cold indifference.

Blake's gaze shifted from his computer to her suitcase, his throat burning as if someone had poured sulfuric acid down it, scorching from his throat to his stomach.

He sneered, his cold, mocking voice like a sharp knife threatening to pierce her eardrums. ""Bringing this tiny bit of stuff‚Äîwhat, you planning to keep coming back for more every few weeks? Amber, did you forget how you landed this position in the first place? I was engaged to Victoria, and you drugged me at our engagement party, got us caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""

""Yeah, that's on me.""

She gripped the handle of her suitcase, her face draining of color, her damp skirt making her appear on the verge of collapse.

Her fingers clenched tightly. After a long silence, she finally spoke hoarsely.

""Blake, I want to know‚Äîwhy did you suddenly stop loving me?""

She had pondered this question many times over the past three years. Back when they huddled together in that cramped apartment, he had said Blake would love Amber forever. Later, after the Westwood family found him, people had warned her to take some money and leave, saying the Westwoods would never accept a daughter-in-law of her background.

She hadn't listened, clinging to his promise, waiting for him to come marry her in grand style.

Instead, she received news of his engagement to Victoria. He said he no longer loved her.

How could he stop loving her so suddenly?

""Because you're not worthy.""

Those words hit her like a hammer blow, making her dizzy.

She couldn't describe the pain. Her heart felt punctured in countless places, bleeding profusely.

When he loved her, he said Amber was the best girl in the world. When he stopped loving her, he casually said she wasn't worthy.

With her ordinary background, she had defended their love in front of those high-society heirs who looked down on her. In their eyes, she was a presumptuous clown.

But she had always thought of herself as a knight, believing his engagement must have been due to unavoidable circumstances.

She had deceived herself for three years. Now it was time to wake up from the dream.

She picked up her suitcase and walked to the entryway. ""Sign it, then. I'll wait for you at the registry office tomorrow at noon.""

After saying this, she changed her shoes, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and smiled. ""Blake, I'm sorry for bothering you all these years.""

Blake's grip on the contract documents trembled with such force that he nearly pierced the paper, then helplessly released them.

""Yes, finally some relief.""

Hearing this, Amber couldn't help but feel hurt. She wanted to smile but found she couldn't.

She could only turn and leave.

Devon was waiting at the door. Seeing her with the suitcase, his face showed conflict. ""Mrs. Westwood, the boss didn't intentionally forget to notify you last night. He...""

Amber dragged her suitcase into the rain, seemingly unwilling to stay a moment longer.

But after a few steps, she stopped and turned to Devon, who still stood at the door. ""The Pine Creek Estate‚Äîwho is he keeping there? Can you tell me?""

Devon tensed visibly, quickly lowering his head, seemingly surprised she knew about that place.

Seeing his reaction, Amber took a small breath. ""He's been keeping someone there for three years, hasn't he?""

""Mrs. Westwood, I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.""

How could he not know? He was Blake's closest confidant.

Amber wiped away the gentle rain from her face, her clothes getting soaked. ""It's fine. You don't have to tell me.""

""Mrs. Westwood...""

But Amber had already stepped into the rain.

When she gave Blake her first time at eighteen, she had imagined their future together.

She never expected that at twenty-six, everything would be shattered, and letting him go would feel like carving out half of her flesh and blood.

But she truly didn't want this anymore.

Chapter 3

When she arrived at her sister Jordan's house dragging her luggage, Amber felt somewhat embarrassed.

After leaving River Haven, she had brought nothing with her except two hundred dollars in cash.

During her three years of marriage, she had developed severe depression amid constant arguments. Afraid to face people, she had stayed in the mansion perfecting her cooking skills, not caring even when her hands were covered in blood blisters. She still loved Blake and wanted to salvage their precarious relationship.

But the meals had grown cold so many times, and he had never eaten them.

Jordan wasn't her biological sister. They had run away from their village together years ago. Jordan had quickly been adopted by a family and now was married, living with her partner in a modest 700-square-foot apartment with a peaceful, warm life.

Later, Amber met Blake when she was near starvation, and he had tossed her a bread roll. She had shamelessly attached herself to him, working alongside him to earn money.

Amber's body was still dripping wet. She quickly wiped her face and rang the doorbell.

Jordan opened the door in her pajamas, looking surprised. From the bedroom came her husband's impatient voice: ""Who is it?""

Jordan pulled her inside and hurried to the bathroom for a clean towel.

""Amber, why are you here in the middle of the night? You're soaking wet. Did you fight with Blake?""

""Can I stay here tonight, sis?""

""Of course. We have an extra bedroom. It's tiny, but I hope you don't mind.""

Jordan handed her a new pair of pajamas and efficiently prepared the bed.

The bathroom was narrow, barely fitting two people, but it had separate wet and dry areas. The corner was covered with brownish water stains that had never been cleaned away.

She quickly took a shower, too embarrassed to use the hair dryer at this hour, and went straight to the bedroom.

The room was indeed small, with just a five-foot bed and a narrow desk.

She heard her brother-in-law's voice from the master bedroom.

""Who is it?""

""Amber. She probably had a fight with Blake.""

""She's a wealthy socialite wife. What's she doing in our place? Don't you know who Blake Westwood is? I've been working in the lowest ranks of Westwood Industries for three years and haven't even glimpsed him once.""

""Enough, Amber is my sister.""

The whispered conversation stopped.

Amber dabbed at her hair with the towel, wrapped it up turban-style, and simply lay down on the bed.

At seven in the morning, the kitchen already echoed with the sounds of breakfast being prepared.

Her hair had dried naturally overnight, but she had a headache and forced herself to get up.

The table was set with five small dishes. Her brother-in-law, Mark Quinn, was setting out plates and noticed her approach. ""Amber, come sit! I bought fish early this morning and had your sister make fish soup.""

They were both working professionals who normally made do with a few slices of bread for breakfast. They had prepared this spread especially for Amber's visit.

Jordan brought over three plates of scrambled eggs and toast, smiling at her. ""Dig in.""

Amber's skin was luminously pale. Since clinging to Blake's side from the age of twelve, he had never mistreated her.

During those impressionable years, she thought it was love, never suspecting he merely saw her as a sister.

She lowered her lashes, her face pained from the headache.

Mark enthusiastically pushed a plate of ribs toward her. ""Jordan got up at five to cook. Hey Amber, did you know I work at Westwood Industries? My supervisor is such a bootlicker, yesterday he made a girl in our department cry. Word is he got in through connections and has cut my salary twice already. Could you maybe put in a word with Blake for me?""

Jordan glared at him, but Mark just smiled.

She quickly ladled some fish soup for Amber. ""You look unwell, and you got rained on last night. Have some soup to warm up, and don't listen to him.""

Amber looked up, her pale face bearing an unhealthy flush. ""I'm sorry, Mark, but Blake and I are getting divorced.""

This statement was met with several seconds of silence at the table.

Mark's surprise flashed briefly across his face before he asked, ""So he's giving you half his fortune? Amber, even though he paid for your education at the best university, you married him right after graduation, right? You've never actually worked, so you probably don't know how to manage money. I'm concerned someone might take advantage of you with all that money.""

""Mark!"" Jordan reprimanded sharply.

Finally, Mark fell silent and took a bite of food.

Jordan had known Amber since childhood. They had journeyed to NY together, like two raindrops merging into a vast sea, where survival itself was a challenge. She got adopted, while Amber bounced from job to job with Blake. Thankfully, Blake treated her decently, working himself to exhaustion to put her through school.

She took a deep breath. ""Just keep your money safe. If you want to buy property, Mark can recommend some‚Ä¶""

""I'm leaving with nothing,"" Amber interrupted. ""He's not giving me any money.""

Mark's expression darkened. After devouring most of the ribs, he stood up and told Jordan, ""I forgot to mention, Mom wants to take you for a medical check-up in a few days. Clear out the guest room‚Äîfamily comes first.""

Jordan remained silent as the front door opened and closed. Mark was gone.

The feast on the table suddenly seemed to lose its appeal.

""Sis, I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward position.""

Jordan's eyes reddened as she sighed. ""I'm not uncomfortable. But how did things get like this between you two? I remember he used to be so good to you. When you secretly got a job without telling him, he scolded you. He worked five jobs a day to support both your educations, and all his scholarship money went to you. Remember that year when you nearly became brain-damaged in that car accident? He worked translations non-stop that year to earn money. How could he now‚Ä¶""

Amber's throat ached, making even swallowing difficult.

Precisely because their past life was impoverished yet beautiful, she had clung to this spider-silk-thin connection, carefully holding on for seven more years, only convincing herself to let go after being wounded beyond recognition.

""Sis, I'll start looking for work this afternoon.""

""Amber, if you need to cry, just cry.""

She couldn't cry anymore. In three years of marriage, her tears had dried up.

She ate breakfast and took on dishwashing duty. Jordan winced seeing those beautiful, slender hands stained with grease.

""Those hands weren't made for housework. Even when Blake was at his poorest, he never let you do things like this.""

Amber froze, waves of dense pain suddenly washing over her, making it hard to breathe.

Jordan had to hurry off to work.

Amber stayed alone until noon, then took her documents and went to the registry office.

But even by one o'clock, Blake hadn't shown up.

She took out her phone and called him.

As usual, he didn't answer.

She had no choice but to call Devon.

""Mr. Ward, where's Blake?""

""Mrs. Westwood, the boss is traveling on business. He might return in three days.""

For these three years, Devon had been her only source of information about his schedule.

She sat in the chair, feeling dizzy and unwell, resting her elbow on her knee. ""Could you give me his upcoming schedule? I want to see when he might be available.""

Devon looked uncomfortably at the man sitting in the chair. The man's aura was cold, keeping people at a thousand-mile distance.",1,1752304725.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Who knew we'd reach a day where the Pope would weigh in on AI? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Vatican has entered the chat. At the AI for Good Summit 2025, Pope Leo XIV sent a powerful message that AI needs ethical management rooted in human dignity‚Äîno divine inspiration required.

### The Digital Crossroads
We're at a digital crossroads, folks! AI's potential to revolutionize industries, solve global challenges, and even pick up our coffee cups is monumental. But Cardinal Parolin, speaking for the Pope, warns that while machines might ace tasks and simulations, they flunk moral discernment and relationship building.

### The Need for Ethical Guardrails
The Pope isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúthou shalt stop AI innovation.‚Äù Instead, it's a rallying cry for ""responsible"" tech development‚Äîa fusion of skill and ethical clarity. He emphasized that AI should serve humanity, ensuring it uplifts rather than undermines our social values.

### Global Governance: A Spiritual Call?
In an unexpected twist, the papal message highlights the necessity for both local and global AI oversight. Imagine countries and cultures coming together‚Äînot for a Sunday roast‚Äîbut to build ethical frameworks for AI. The Pope‚Äôs call? Make sure AI reflects our shared values, not just what‚Äôs efficient or profitable.

### Bridging the Digital Divide
Finally, a nod to the harsh reality: 2.6 billion humans remain disconnected from basic communication technologies. The Vatican argues for AI tech that supports social harmony and fair resource distribution.

So, folks, while robots may never replace priests (or ethical judgments), the discussion is on the table. What are your thoughts on the Vatican‚Äôs call for ethical AI governance? Do we need divine intervention, or just a bit of common sense and collaboration? Share your thoughts and ethical epiphanies below!",1,1752304614.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Anyway, ive (22m) have been friends with this guy (32m) for 3 yrs now and we started living together a little over a year ago. Immediately knew there would be problems in multiple ways. Main things include he changed a lot when he got sober towards the beginning not that him not drinking is a problem but it was more he decided he was ready for the next part of his life in a way and now im just the bum 22 yr old that helped him move cross country, he is normally way less clean than I am and after the first couple months of doing most of cleaning I stopped caring so much although it bugged me he'd leave coffee stains and crumbs on the counter for weeks and only clean pots and pans when he needed them. He'd only sweep the central area but leave all the shedding from his cat tree in the corner and I was the only making things look nice or smell nice. He also spends all his time in the common area. He reads, watches TV which i bought because when we moved in he didn't want to set up his projector, does school work, stretches, anything and everything really. The list goes on really but now he's got a girlfriend and now he wants to keep things clean, and now the board game nights we would set up together im getting a last minute consideration in, and he's hanging out in the living room with this girl who lives by herself in her own apartment 15 min away and he also has a TV and shit in his room that he refuses to set up. Even when he was dating around id come home from work to some random chick on the couch and a couple times id walk in on them dry humping on the couch (also something i bought). And sometimes it seems like he expects certain considerations that he refuses to give. I keep the TV on a lowish volume he turns that thing way up and sometimes at night I'll leave it and he'll come out and ask me to turn it down even tho when I did that when I used to work at 4am he'd act annoyed ""cause it ruins the cinematic experience"". Now he acts like he cares about my dog cause his girlfriend has a dog and he'd help out with him beforehand but id have to ask and now he'll just do something which is cool but seems fake. What's really gotten under my nerves is my birthdays coming up and my parents are coming to town and getting an air bnb for a couple days and I'll probably spend a decent amount of time there. Not really how I want to spend my birthday but im not gonna tell my parents not to come, but this guy is treating it like a weekend of me out of town. He's trying to make sure I won't be home for a couple days and that im taking my dog with me so he can have his girlfriend and her dog over. Not super stoked for her dog to be here cause its a great dane and while I love all dogs I don't love overly drooly dogs especially not on furniture ive bought and I sit in but how can I say no cause he pays rent here too. I don't like doing anything big for my bday but like I said this is the highlight of my birthday to him he's not interested in doing anything with me other than making sure im not here so he can hangout with his girlfriend and her dog who again already live by themselves fairly close. Like am I insane for thinking that the convenient option for everyone would be the go to? I've talked to other friends and they agree if you have an s/o over you keep it in your room or if someone lives alone that's the regular space to hang. Maybe that's the difference between a 20 something and a 30 something but if your a 30 something living with a 20 something maybe don't expect to live the same way your independent girlfriend does. Idk i regret signing another year lease and more so I regret losing a friend cause I really don't like him after living together for over a year now. I know people change but a lot of my gripes really just come down to living with him and how he treats things. I still try and want to be his friend but at the end of the day he does enough things that annoy the piss out of me I don't see my view of him changing for the better anytime soon.

**Serafina**

‚ÄúMatteo, please.‚Äù My voice cracks like I‚Äôm some desperate teenager instead of a grown woman in a designer gown. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ look at me. Really look at me.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt even glance up from adjusting his platinum cufflinks‚Äîthe ones I bought him for our first anniversary. His dark hair is perfectly styled, not a strand out of place, because God forbid Matteo Verrelli looks anything less than immaculate. Sharp jaw, those cold gray eyes that used to make my stomach flip, now they just make me nauseous. He‚Äôs all sharp angles and expensive suits, like he was carved from marble by some twisted artist who forgot to add a soul.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy, Serafina.‚Äù His voice is flat, dismissive. Like I‚Äôm the help asking for a raise.

‚ÄúWhen aren‚Äôt you busy?‚Äù I‚Äôm standing in our bedroom‚Äîcorrection,¬†*his*¬†bedroom that I happen to sleep in‚Äîwearing this ridiculous emerald silk dress that cost more than most people‚Äôs cars. The color brings out my dark eyes, makes my olive skin glow. At least, that‚Äôs what I used to think. Now I feel like I‚Äôm playing dress-up in someone else‚Äôs life.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù The words tumble out like a confession, desperate and pathetic. ‚ÄúI know this marriage started as‚Ä¶ business, but I love you. I have for two years now, and I just need to know if there‚Äôs any part of you that could‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

One word. Two letters. Complete annihilation.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He straightens his tie, checks his Rolex. ‚ÄúWe have an arrangement, Serafina. Don‚Äôt complicate it with‚Ä¶ feelings.‚Äù

Feelings. Like love is some inconvenient side effect I caught from drinking the wrong water.

The family dinner that night is a masterclass in psychological warfare. Viviana sits at the head of the table like a queen presiding over an execution, her perfectly coiffed silver hair catching the candlelight. She‚Äôs been sharpening her claws on me for three years, and tonight she‚Äôs going for the throat.

Viviana Verrelli‚Äîborn Viviana Rossi, daughter of a minor tobacco baron‚Äîclawed her way into this family forty years ago by being prettier and more ruthless than anyone else. She‚Äôs spent decades perfecting the art of destroying other women while maintaining her saintly facade. Started with Matteo‚Äôs father‚Äôs first wife, who mysteriously developed a ‚Äúdrinking problem‚Äù and died in a car accident. Then moved on to systematically eliminating every female threat to her position. I‚Äôm just the latest in a long line of casualties.

‚ÄúSerafina,¬†*cara*,‚Äù she begins, voice dripping with fake sweetness, ‚Äúperhaps you should see Dr. Martinelli again. About your‚Ä¶ fertility issues.‚Äù

The words hit like a slap. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have fertility issues.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why,‚Äù Bianca chimes in, twirling her pasta like she‚Äôs discussing the weather, ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt you given us an heir? Three years is plenty of time, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

Bianca Verrelli‚Äîtwenty-eight, Matteo‚Äôs younger sister, and living proof that privilege can create monsters. She‚Äôs got everything handed to her on a silver platter but still needs to destroy other people for sport. Looks like she stepped off a Milan runway‚Äîall sharp cheekbones and predatory grace, dark hair swept into a perfect chignon. She moves like she owns every room she enters, which technically she does since Daddy owns half of northern Italy.

Her specialty is psychological warfare disguised as sisterly concern. She‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù invited Matteo‚Äôs ex-girlfriend to our wedding anniversary dinner. The one who ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to tell me about the dress code at family events, leaving me underdressed and humiliated. The one who spreads rumors about my ‚Äúinstability‚Äù to anyone who‚Äôll listen.

‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs not trying hard enough,‚Äù Bianca rumbles from her chair, not even looking up from her wine. ‚ÄúIn our family, wives always understood their duties.‚Äù

My face burns. ‚ÄúI understand my duties perfectly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù Viviana‚Äôs smile could freeze hell. ‚ÄúBecause from where I sit, you‚Äôve been quite the disappointment. No children, no connections of value, no skills beyond looking pretty at parties.‚Äù

‚ÄúI graduated summa cum laude from‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom a state school,‚Äù Bianca interrupts with a laugh. ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ quaint.‚Äù

Matteo says nothing. Just cuts his veal like we‚Äôre discussing the weather instead of dissecting my worth as a human being.

‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù Viviana continues, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to reconsider this arrangement. The Costello girl from Naples is quite lovely, and her father owns‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù Matteo‚Äôs voice cuts through the tension. ‚ÄúSerafina and I will handle our marriage privately.‚Äù

My heart does this stupid little flutter of hope. Maybe he does care. Maybe‚Äî

‚ÄúActually,‚Äù he continues, setting down his knife, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to have dinner with you tomorrow night. Just us. We need to talk.‚Äù

I spend the entire next day in a pathetic state of hope. Maybe this is it. Maybe he‚Äôs finally going to fight for us. I get my hair done, buy a new dress‚Äîred silk that hugs every curve‚Äîand actually let myself believe that three years of marriage might mean something.

The restaurant is perfect. Intimate. Candlelit. The kind of place where proposals happen and marriages get saved.

‚ÄúYou look beautiful,‚Äù Matteo says when I arrive, and for a moment, I see the man I fell in love with.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I slide into the booth, heart hammering. ‚ÄúThis is nice. It‚Äôs been so long since we‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSerafina, there‚Äôs someone I want you to meet.‚Äù

The words hit me like ice water. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

That‚Äôs when she appears. Tall, blonde, absolutely stunning in that effortless way that screams Russian aristocracy. She‚Äôs wearing a simple black dress that probably costs more than my car, and she moves like she owns the world.

‚ÄúThis is Anastasia Ruffo,‚Äù Matteo says, standing to kiss her cheek. ‚ÄúAnastasia, my wife, Serafina.‚Äù

Wife. He says it like it‚Äôs a job title he‚Äôs about to eliminate.

‚ÄúPleasure,‚Äù Anastasia purrs in accented English, extending a perfectly manicured hand. ‚ÄúMatteo has told me so much about you.‚Äù

I stare at her hand like it‚Äôs a snake. ‚ÄúHas he?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, sit.‚Äù Matteo gestures to the chair across from me. ‚ÄúWe have a lot to discuss.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought this was dinner for two,‚Äù I manage.

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor two people who matter.‚Äù

The cruelty of it steals my breath.

‚ÄúSerafina,‚Äù Anastasia says, settling into her chair like she belongs there, ‚ÄúI want you to know I have nothing but respect for what you‚Äôve done for the Verrelli family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve done?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour service,‚Äù she continues smoothly. ‚ÄúThree years of loyalty. It‚Äôs admirable.‚Äù

Service. Like I‚Äôm the goddamn help.

‚ÄúBut now,‚Äù Matteo says, reaching across the table to take Anastasia‚Äôs hand, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for the family to move forward. Anastasia brings connections we need. Political power. Financial backing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù But I know. God help me, I already know.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying our arrangement has served its purpose.‚Äù His voice is matter-of-fact, like he‚Äôs discussing a business merger. ‚ÄúThe papers are already drawn up. You‚Äôll be well compensated, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúCompensated?‚Äù The word comes out strangled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting married, Serafina. To someone who can actually help this family grow.‚Äù

The restaurant spins around me. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm your wife.‚Äù

His gaze sharpens. ‚ÄúYou still are. And now Anastasia will be too.‚Äù

Chapter 2

**Serafina**

I‚Äôm still sitting in this restaurant, staring at my husband and his‚Ä¶ what the¬†*fuck*¬†do I even call her? His upgrade? His replacement? The blonde Russian who just told me our marriage was a ‚Äúbusiness transaction.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joking.‚Äù The words come out like a croak. ‚ÄúThis is some kind of sick joke.‚Äù

Matteo doesn‚Äôt even blink. ‚ÄúI need an heir, Serafina. Three years and nothing. Anastasia can give me what you can‚Äôt.‚Äù

The casual cruelty of it hits me like a brick to the face. ‚ÄúWhat I can‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúChildren.‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs ordering coffee. ‚ÄúThe family needs an heir. You‚Äôve had your chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had my chance?‚Äù My voice cracks. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt even tried in weeks. You barely touch me.‚Äù

Anastasia leans forward, all fake sympathy and predatory smile. ‚ÄúOh, sweetie. Maybe that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ busy.‚Äù

The implication hits me like ice water. ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúSix months,‚Äù Matteo says. ‚ÄúMaybe seven.‚Äù

Seven months. Seven¬†*fucking*¬†months he‚Äôs been cheating on me while I‚Äôve been playing the perfect wife, wondering why he won‚Äôt even look at me.

‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs the thing,‚Äù Anastasia continues, swirling her wine like we‚Äôre discussing vacation plans. ‚ÄúI think this could work out beautifully for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat could work out?‚Äù

‚ÄúSister-wives!‚Äù She claps her hands together like she just solved world hunger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the main wife, obviously. The one who produces heirs. But you can stay! Like a‚Ä¶ what do you call it‚Ä¶ companion?‚Äù

I stare at her. ‚ÄúAre you fucking insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúThink about it,‚Äù Matteo says, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúYou keep your lifestyle. Your status. Your security. And I get what I need from someone who can actually deliver.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is insane.‚Äù I stand up, chair scraping against the floor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù Matteo‚Äôs voice goes cold. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not done.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, we are.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour father owes the family two million dollars.‚Äù

I freeze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs gambling debt. Did you think we forgot? The only reason we haven‚Äôt collected is because of you.‚Äù

The restaurant spins around me. I sit back down before I fall down.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Anastasia purrs. ‚ÄúSo you see, darling, you don‚Äôt really have a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is blackmail.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is business,‚Äù Matteo corrects. ‚ÄúSame as it‚Äôs always been.‚Äù

My phone buzzes. A text from Viviana:¬†*Come home immediately. We need to discuss your new arrangement.*

‚ÄúThey already know,‚Äù I whisper.

‚ÄúThe whole family‚Äôs on board,‚Äù Matteo confirms. ‚ÄúMother thinks it‚Äôs a brilliant solution. Bianca‚Äôs already planning the new sleeping arrangements.‚Äù

‚ÄúSleeping arrangements?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, he can‚Äôt exactly have two wives in the same bed,‚Äù Anastasia laughs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure the guest room is lovely.‚Äù

The guest room. I‚Äôm being demoted to the fucking guest room in my own house.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù Anastasia continues. ‚ÄúLike having a sister! You can help with wedding planning. Maybe babysit when the little ones come.‚Äù

Babysit. She wants me to babysit her children with my husband.

‚ÄúThis is sick,‚Äù I manage.

‚ÄúThis is practical,‚Äù Matteo says. ‚ÄúYou get to stay Mrs. Verrelli. Just‚Ä¶ not the only one.‚Äù

My mind goes blank. Like someone just unplugged my brain and left me running on autopilot. This can‚Äôt be happening. This can‚Äôt be real.

‚ÄúI need time to think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to think about,‚Äù Matteo says. ‚ÄúThe papers are already drawn up. You can sign them tonight or tomorrow morning. Your choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat papers?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe amendment to our marriage contract. Acknowledging Anastasia as my second wife and primary heir-bearer.‚Äù

Heir-bearer. Like I‚Äôm livestock that failed to produce.

‚ÄúAnd if I refuse?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs debt comes due immediately.‚Äù His smile is arctic. ‚ÄúPlus interest. Plus penalties. I believe that puts it at around four million now.‚Äù

Four million dollars. My dad doesn‚Äôt have four million cents.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look so sad, sister,‚Äù Anastasia reaches across the table to pat my hand. ‚ÄúThis could be wonderful. You‚Äôll have built-in help with all the boring wife duties. And I promise I‚Äôll take good care of Matteo.‚Äù

The way she says his name makes me want to throw up.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I need air.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you do,‚Äù Matteo signals for the check. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt take too long deciding. The family‚Äôs waiting.‚Äù

I stumble toward the bathroom, legs shaking. In the mirror, I look like a ghost. Pale, hollow-eyed, broken.

When I come back, they‚Äôre both smiling at me like I‚Äôm a puppy who just learned a new trick.

‚ÄúReady to go home and make this official?‚Äù Anastasia asks sweetly.

Home. To sign papers making me a sister-wife to a Russian socialite who‚Äôs been fucking my husband for seven months.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I hear myself say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready.‚Äù

After gradually building my kit, I finally have my little coffee corner set up and running smooth. Nothing fancy or OTT ‚Äî just a solid setup for good manual brews at home. Thought I‚Äôd share it here :
---
üîπ Core Setup & Gear:

Wacaco Picopresso ‚Äì The hero of my espresso journey. Took a while to source (was out of stock everywhere in India), but finally got my hands on it!

Aeropress Go ‚Äì Super reliable and travel-ready. My go-to for quick brews when I‚Äôm not pulling shots.

French Press ‚Äì Not for brewing, but for frothing milk. Works surprisingly well when you don't want to invest in a separate frother.

Timemore Chestnut C3 ‚Äì Absolute value-for-money grinder. Paired with RDT using the spray bottle before grinding for consistent performance.

Budget Hoffen Scale (Amazon) ‚Äì Gets the job done without breaking the bank. Would love a Timemore Black Mirror someday, but this works great for now.

Stovetop Gooseneck Kettle (InstaCuppa) ‚Äì No fancy temperature control, but thermometer on it works well for my and AeroPress control.

üîπ Storage & Vibes:

-Wall-mounted IKEA pegboard ‚Äì Keeps everything neat and accessible. Hooks for cups and a small shelf for the essentials.

Cups & Glasses ‚Äì

-The white steel mug and glass jar on the left are souvenirs from our Cambodia trip üá∞üá≠

-Glass pear-print straw glasses are perfect for iced coffee or cold brews.

-A few clear and ceramic mugs for various brews depending on the mood.

Currently Brewing:
Blue Tokai Producer Series ‚Äì Fruit Punch. Super fruity and works great with both AeroPress.

Three times now her mother has died and she needs Money to get to Portadown for the funeral. For someone homeless she strangely always seems to be in clean clothes, hair washed etc.
 Earlier this year I started a new job and she was coming to the door asking for free coffees and my colleague was giving them to her on the grounds that 'she's homeless' she then starts asking for free sandwiches and chocolate bars which he again gave her. She was frequently under the influence of drugs and I started referring to her as 'The tap dancer' because she'd be so high she was hopping foot to foot. After we started refusing to provide refreshments and told her to stop asking she stopped coming.
Walking to work and she stops me in the street

 'excuse me have you got any change please'

'No I haven't. You always ask me and the answer is always no'

'Stuck up cunt what do you need it all for wouldn't hurt you to spare me a couple of pound'

At this point I stop walking and turn around to face her

'Well considering you've told me three times now that your mother's died and you need to go to Portadown for the funeral I surmise you're probably spending it on drugs. But what I do with my money is my business. I earn it after all.. Just for your information I'm a disabled ex serviceman. I get zero help for my disability. My wife is disabled and can't work. She gets minimal help too. I've worked and paid tax all My life. Don't see you working. Did you serve?'

1lxtzo7,https://i.redd.it/h5jndwuy4ecf1.jpeg,Wealthy wine makers dream of hipster paradise on Mare Island Comes to an end.,"End of an era for savage and cooke as wine barrels are loaded onto a flatbed behind its former distillery. Two brands. One dreamed up by a pair of locals who shared a passion for beer and history, the other, a brain child of a multi millionaire wine maker from the heart of Napa Valley. Thriving Mare Island Brewery embraces the martime and working class history of its region and Savage & Cooke wanted to shed it. Only one of the two prevailed. While one brand embraced History, the other, mystery. It's remaind unclear who these Savage and Cooke fellas actually were. If the curious patron inquired about the brand origins, they were told about the allure of its visionary creator instead. If pressed further they might have been told they were names found on secret documents during construcion of the distillery, or they were brothers or spies. It was alway a fuzzy response when asked, but the genius and adroitness of its owner were always made clear during an inquiry. A man with a boutique coffee roaster, a winery, a fried chicken restaurant and more on his vision board for Mare Island. Was the uncertainness of the future of the wine industry his downfall? Or maybe the delivery of historic ships to Mare Island clogged up the vision he had for his waterfront. In the end the reality showed Savage and Cooke intermittently preparing fried chicken in a makeshift trailer 4 days a week, while Mare Island Brewery grew it's two locations and added a third. It may not be over for the little guy after all, or guys in this case.

To top it off, my birthday is Monday. Nothing has been said. No mention of a family dinner, not even a ‚Äúwhat are your plans?‚Äù Nothing. Just silence.

Except ‚Äî my dad did call. To let me know my grandpa would be coming out soon and I should make time for him. Not for me. Not to celebrate my birthday. Just another family obligation, as if I‚Äôm a fixture, not a daughter.

I feel gutted.

I‚Äôve spent 30 years hoping they'd change. That they‚Äôd finally see me. Love me. Acknowledge me. I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve built from the wreckage they left behind. But it hurts so much that they can‚Äôt even pretend to care ‚Äî not for my success, not for my birthday, not for me.

I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm tired of begging for scraps of love.
I don‚Äôt know if I should go no contact.

1lxtxfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zimbabwe/comments/1lxtxfo/struggling_with_feeling_like_i_never_belong/,Struggling with feeling like I never belong,"Hey guys, I have recently been reflecting on my life and why I might not have friends etc. 

I am 27F, I work a job that I love, and sadly that's the only joy I have in life at the moment . I actually don't have friends that are my people. I just have people that I can hang out with or talk to when there is someone else there , never one on one. 
I have been reflecting and I have realised that the reason I don't have my own friends and my own people is because I'm actually really scared. I don't mind talking to people in a group setting etc because that way all the attention is not on me . 

I'll never hang out with someone one on one because I just think they will start to notice that I'm really dumb, uninteresting and just weird. this will make them reject me. After most interactions I'm left overthinking if they now hate me or respect me less etc because of what they have found out. ( that I'm not that interesting ) 

I always do stuff by myself. I take myself out to eat, I go to places by myself and try new things by myself. I have learnt to be content with my own company because that's where I feel the safest. But I wish I could make friends, real friends that will be in my life for the long haul. 

I grew up with extended family and never really felt wanted or like I belonged as a child so maybe this is where it stems from. Even with the extended family that raised me, I struggle to connect with them because I'm always thinking "" I have nothing to say, I'm awkward, or if I talk to them they will just realise how dumb I am and how uninteresting I am and reject me"" 

It's so silly I know, but that's how I feel. 

I wish I could be one of those people that could go and have a coffee with a friend or make friends that are my real people, who will be there for me and support me when I get married and be there for me in life. 
But something in me always whispers that no one will be that interested in me and that if i invite them into my life they will very quickly see how unworthy I am and leave me. ",9,1752302934.0,Zimbabwe,5,0.92,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a bottle brush Christmas tree involves careful consideration of various features that contribute to its overall aesthetic and quality.

**Material and Construction:**

The material used in crafting a bottle brush tree considerably impacts its durability and appearance. high-quality trees are typically made from dense, finely crafted sisal bristles, which are securely attached to a sturdy wire frame. The construction method involves meticulously twisting the wire around the bristles to create a dense and uniform texture. Cheaper alternatives may use inferior materials like plastic or loosely attached bristles, resulting in a less authentic look and reduced longevity. Look for trees with a consistent bristle density and a robust base to ensure they remain upright and stable. The wire used should also be coated or painted to prevent rust and maintain the tree's visual appeal over extended periods.

**Size and Proportions:**

Bottle brush trees come in a diverse range of sizes, from miniature ornaments to larger tabletop displays. understanding the proportions of a tree is important to ensure it fits seamlessly within your intended space.Height, width, and the overall shape of the tree should be considered. Taller trees tend to dominate the scene, while smaller ones can be grouped together for a visual impact. The proportions should be balanced, with a consistent taper from base to tip. Additionally, consider the space required for ornaments or other decorations you plan to add.

**Color and Detailing:**

Beyond the traditional green, bottle brush trees are available in various colors, including white, silver, gold, and even pastel hues. The color should be evenly applied and resistant to fading or chipping. Detailing, such as flocked snow, glitter accents, or painted berries, adds to the tree's visual appeal. However,excessive detailing can look artificial and detract from the tree's natural charm. Opt for subtle and well-executed details that complement the tree's overall design.Look for trees with realistic-looking ""snow"" that stays in place and doesn't shed excessively.

**Base and Stability:**

The base of a bottle brush tree is crucial for its stability and presentation.Common base materials include wood, ceramic, or metal. A sturdy base prevents the tree from tipping over easily, especially when decorated. The base should also be proportional to the tree's size and design. A well-crafted base adds to the tree's aesthetic appeal. Some bases may feature decorative elements like painted patterns or textured finishes. Ensure that the base is securely attached to the tree and provides adequate support.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Eliot said, slamming the door shut. ‚ÄúBeen walking forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you headed?‚Äù the driver asked, eyes locked on the road.

‚ÄúAnywhere but here,‚Äù Eliot muttered. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúCall me Mark.‚Äù

The two shared a silence that only the road could stretch. Mark‚Äôs car was littered with coffee cups, road maps, and cassette tapes. One of them, labeled DO NOT PLAY, caught Eliot‚Äôs eye.

As the rain poured, Mark started talking‚Äîstrange things. ‚ÄúDo you ever feel like you‚Äôre not real?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúLike, maybe‚Ä¶ someone else is driving you?‚Äù

Eliot chuckled nervously. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty dark.‚Äù

Mark didn‚Äôt laugh. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs darker?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been driving this road for years. Picking up people. People who‚Ä¶ disappear.‚Äù

Eliot turned to him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean disappear?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Just‚Ä¶ gone. They get out and I never see them again. Or sometimes, they vanish from the car.‚Äù

Eliot‚Äôs mouth went dry. He gripped the door handle. ‚ÄúYou joking?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Mark‚Äôs voice was steady. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm part of something. A test. An experiment.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when Eliot noticed something else. The fuel gauge wasn‚Äôt moving. The mile markers kept repeating: Mile 77, Mile 77, Mile 77‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù Eliot asked.

Mark suddenly pulled over.

‚ÄúYou have to get out now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?!‚Äù Eliot shouted.

Mark turned slowly. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Mark reached into the glove box and handed Eliot a folded photo.

Eliot opened it.

It was a picture of himself‚Äîstanding next to Mark‚Ä¶ from ten years ago.

His head spun.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember this,‚Äù Eliot whispered.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù Mark said. ‚ÄúThey reset you every time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs voice trembled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the last version of you‚Ä¶ who survived long enough to find out.‚Äù

Eliot froze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not hitchhiking,‚Äù Mark said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre escaping the loop they‚Äôve trapped your consciousness in. They keep rebooting you, wiping you. I figured it out too late. You won‚Äôt remember this next time.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, this is insane,‚Äù Eliot backed away.

Mark nodded solemnly.

‚ÄúAnd the worst part?‚Äù Mark said, eyes dark. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôm the real one anymore.‚Äù

Suddenly, Mark grinned.

A sinister, inhuman grin.

And then he vanished.

Vanished into thin air‚Äîseat empty, engine still running.

Eliot was alone in the car.

A sharp pain shot through his skull. He screamed.

1lxtnc8,https://i.redd.it/qw38m9761ecf1.jpeg,My best pour over so far!,"Hi all,

I'm extremely excited to share that I had a great experience with this particular recipe today. (I thought it would be great if people could share theirs for all of us to try!)

Beans: Subko Garo Hills 
Grind: C2 16 clicks
Brewer: Hario V60
Broad method: Tetsu Kasuya 4:6
12 grams coffee - 200 ml water

1st pour (bloom): 35 ml, swirl, wait ~30-45 seconds. This pour is in the circular fashion

2nd pour: 45 ml, wait ~15 seconds. This pour is in the circular fashion

3rd pour: 40 ml, swirl, wait 10 seconds. This pour is in the circular fashion

These last two pours I wanted to reduce agitation and so used an aeropress bottom piece to pour through (the one with the holes). This makes the water just sit on top and not penetrate the bed/agitate it. (Found this from a Lance Hendrick video) I think using a spoon to disperse the stream could have the same effect. 

4th pour: 40 ml, wait 10 seconds. 
5th pour: 40 ml, wait till drained. No agitation. 

This gave me a nice sweet cup with no bitter after tastes. Kind of insanely good. Only thing was that the bed wasn't level at the end since we didn't swirl etc. However the cup didn't feel like it had had any channeling so I don't mind that. 

Let me know if you try it and how that goes!

## What is Turbo Inomax 500?

Turbo Inomax 500 is a **web-based trading platform** designed to make automated trading more accessible. Whether you're trading crypto, forex, or other assets, it uses algorithms to analyze market trends and place trades on your behalf.

What makes it stand out is its **user-friendly interface** and **real-time analytics**. It‚Äôs especially geared toward users who don‚Äôt want to spend hours glued to charts but still want to make informed decisions. It‚Äôs also equipped with customization tools, so you can set your own risk levels and trading preferences.

## Who Created Turbo Inomax 500?

There‚Äôs no single face behind Turbo Inomax 500, and that‚Äôs not uncommon in the world of fintech platforms.

While the creators remain semi-anonymous, the tech backing the platform seems legit. They‚Äôve clearly put thought into building a system that focuses on **automation, accessibility, and data-driven insights**.

Would I prefer more transparency? Absolutely. But this level of anonymity isn‚Äôt unheard of, especially in crypto-related tools.

Turbo Inomax 500 uses an **AI-driven algorithm** to scan global markets 24/7. It looks for profitable trading opportunities in real time and either sends you alerts or executes trades automatically, depending on your settings.

- Choose whether you want **manual** or **automated** trading.
- Set your trading preferences (risk level, trade size, etc.).
- The algorithm does the rest ‚Äî scanning markets and executing trades.

It‚Äôs not a crystal ball, but it‚Äôs designed to react faster than human traders can. That speed and data crunching can be a huge edge in volatile markets like crypto.

For reference: The point where this photo was taken connects to a dining room (behind pov) and a staircase (going down) to the right. To the left of the shelf on the far left corner is another entry way. To the far right of the living room is an entryway to the backyard.
Essentially open/wanting to get rid of and replace all of the furniture other than the piano. I know the layout can be better but have a really hard time visualizing or understanding what wools be best. 
Definitely want a smaller coffee table. Would love it to feel more cozy, bright, open. 

Any ideas or AI renditions will be greatly appreciated!
