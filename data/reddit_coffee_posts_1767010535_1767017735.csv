Hey folks,
Last few days of the year + offices on leave = perfect time to step out, meet new people, and make memories before 2025 hits.

I’m looking to connect with a small group of chill people who just want to vibe, explore, and say yes to random plans.
Up for literally anything interesting:

🍻 Pubs / clubbing - find a place with good music and dance till we lose track of time
☕ Cafés - long conversations over coffee & food runs
🎮 Games / sports - pool, bowling, go-karting, sim racing, badminton, you name it
🌃 Late night drives / walks - Bangalore winter nights hit different
📸 events / gigs - open to discovering cool spots
🎬 Movies / shows - spontaneous plan = best plan
🚀 Something new & random - open to ideas

No pressure. No awkwardness. No big expectations , just good vibes and fun people enjoying the holiday mood.
If you’re also free and want to make these last days of December count, drop a comment or DM. Let’s build a small group and plan something!",1,1767017538.0,BangaloreHouseParties,0,1.0,False
1pyn8s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pyn8s9/just_feel_completely_and_totally_behind_in_the/,Just feel completely and totally behind in the dating world,"*This is on a throwaway because I wouldn't dare talk about this with anyone I actually know. I'll try to cover everything that's relevant.*

**About Me**

I'm a dude in college who turned 23 a couple of months ago. I don't know how to describe myself to be honest. I guess I look okay. I'm not physically deformed but I also don't look above average. The most damning being my uneven eyes and my inability to smile. I'm average height, maybe a little taller. I guess I'm healthy? I don't know, I'm not ripped or anything but I'm doing okay. And my style is currently transitioning towards a more retro look. My hobbies are mostly pretty nerdy outside of music related stuff. I don't know how to classify my personality, I guess reserved and introverted would be it?

Relationship with family is, distant, at best. My dad died when I was 18 and I generally feel like my parents made a mistake getting together. My relationship with my mom is a dumpster fire which is mainly thanks to her. Emotionally instability and emotional abuse were her bread and butter.

Academically, I'm doing pretty good. I have an AA and I'm in the process of getting my BA. I'm also flirting with the idea of getting my MA since my college has a program that lets you obtain it without paying a lot in tuition.

**Social Circle**

I guess it's okay? I have a moderately sized social circle I cultivated after transferring from community college. I've got one close friend who I've known since middle school. Most of my friends are some kind of geek or nerd. Some of them are into stuff like cosplay, while others are more into gaming. Personally, I'm more into worldbuilding and music. It's also pretty mixed with both men, women, and everyone in between.

I'm not really close to any of them. Outside of maybe my closest friend, none of them really know about my home life or anything that makes me vulnerable. I'd open up, but I've found that if I do that, I'll be ghosted. So I typically just don't talk about personal stuff. Which is funny because my friends get to talk about their baggage to me and I welcome it.

Believe me if I felt comfortable doing so, I would be asking for my friends' help on this. But I know for a fact that they are not going to help with this.

**Dating**

If I had to describe my dating life it'd be ""lol, lmao even."" I've never been someone's crush, gotten asked out, or really desired by anyone. Most of the time whenever I fall for a girl, she's some kind of unavailable. The absolute best I was able to do was a couple of months ago where I went on one date with a girl, who then made the next few months hell for me with mixed signals until she finally said something like ""I value your friendship"" to cut me loose. I'm also still a virgin if that matters.

I've tried to tackle it from any angle I could think of and to be honest, I can never win or feel any kind of closure. If I ask out a ton of women, I'm a creep who's treating women like whores. If I try to be friends first, I'm being a gross nice guy who's only after one thing. If I make my intentions known right off the bat, I'm putting to much pressure on them. If I just stop looking, then I don't find anyone. If I'm asking out anyone then I have no standards. If I try to keep to a list of qualities I find attractive then I'm being too shallow no matter how short said list is.

I get that I'm not owed anything, maybe this is just life's way to telling me that I'm a naturally solitary person. I just want to be a good partner to someone. I want to matter to someone and for someone to matter to me. And it sucks more so because I'm being constantly made to feel like I'm this unfished building that's condemned and has to do all of this renovating. I'm made to feel like I'm full of flaws and that I shouldn't even have the gall to ask someone out for coffee unless I do all of this inner work.

It's hard to say all this and then narrow down on a specific thing I want advice on. I guess I just want help on all of it.",1,1767017458.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I am new to Melbourne and hoping to connect with someone kind, thoughtful, and comfortable with good conversation. I am naturally introverted but articulate, curious, and enjoy letting connections develop at a comfortable pace.

**A bit of background**

I grew up in a traditional household and moved to Melbourne fairly recently. I focused heavily on education and career early on, which means I’m now intentionally making space for social connection, conversation, and shared experiences.

**Who I’d like to connect with**

* Women 25+ (no upper age limit)
* People who enjoy conversation and emotional intelligence
* Those who value patience, clarity, and mutual respect

I am open to chatting online first, then perhaps meeting for a coffee, a walk, or a relaxed outing if we’re both comfortable. There’s no pressure to define anything — connection comes first.

**About me**

* 31 years old
* Work in accounting and finance; enjoy tech and smart systems
* Enjoy walking the city (probably faster than most!)
* 173cm, ~70kg, black hair, brown skin
* Originally from a tropical island country

I value kindness, good communication, and curiosity about people. If you enjoy thoughtful conversation and seeing where things naturally lead, feel free to say hello.

I am always happy to answer questions — consider this an open invitation to a friendly interview.

I moved into this new flat not too far away from them.
Over the year they kept asking when I would do a move in party or invite them over etc.

The thing is, im autistic. I need my safe space that i can escape to when things get too much. Back then it was my room. Now its my whole flat. Its not very big, barely 2 rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. If I invited people ober I know I would have to clean EVERYTHING, fix up my furniture to make it comfortable for my guests instead of just me. Id have to get plates and cups and other things...
Id have to provide for my guests and I dont think I could mentally do that as its very very stressful and id wouldnt have a place to escape to if it did. As the only other room in this flat is my bedroom which is right next to the living room.

My parents gifted me a coffee machine for Christmas this year and ever since then they've been asking me when they get invited for coffee and cake. 

Its just way too stressful for me amd I dont want my safe space to be entered by other people,no matter if they are family or not because either way, other people make it not be safe anymore. 

So AITH for not inviting my parents? Should I just... tighten up and power through it? I dont want another anxiety attack. But I also dont want them to hate me. I just dont understand how they cannot understand that I have boundaries. And thise boundaries mean not inviting people into my flat. ",1,1767017111.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1pyn2i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pyn2i7/supporting_depressed_friend_concerned_im_enabling/,Supporting depressed friend - concerned I'm enabling - feels toxic and I'm drowning,"I desperately need advice navigating an incredibly challenging and draining situation.   
  
I (31F) was in a 'relationship' with someone else (29F) for 2.5 years though our 'relationship' was always secret on her side because of her faith - I never met her friends or family, and she would never acknowledge it as a relationship even though it was. She met my friends. We were inseparable, a connection I have never shared with anyone, but after 2.5 years her visa ran out, she was leaving the country and that felt a good time to call it since it was never going to go anywhere given her faith.   
  
That was July this year - knew it was coming, grieved it while the relationship was still happening, so after it ended, I had actually processed the loss of that part of our relationship.   
  
Over the course of the relationship, her severe mental health challenges became apparent. Consuming depression, social anxiety, difficulty interacting with my friends (who did not like her) and a total reliance on us spending time together. It pulled me away from my friendships and it was only earlier this year that I realized I needed to sort out my shit to get my friendships back on track, which I did.

After we ended, she went into a dark place. We were trying to maintain a friendship but what she was sharing with me and putting on me as her only source of support was too much for me to handle - I was struggling myself at the same time with depressive feelings from my job, my younger sister being diagnosed with cancer, and general life unrest. I found it too much how much she told me she missed me, needed me, that I was the only person she has. 

It became a toxic spiral where I ended up needing space and we barely spoke for several months. She respected this largely, and I was able to rebuild myself to a place where we could speak again, altho things felt fraught and stilted and on eggshells. But she was still in a very dark place, and after giving me what I needed, she told me that she needed to find her healthier rhythm that she had had in the US while we lived together, where she did football, dance classes, photography, but I was hesitant about being pulled back into a cycle of her depending on me - she never made any friends while living in the US for 1.5 years. I thought she wanted to come for a week - she wanted to come for a month, which after hearing how much she needed it, I agreed to, but made it clear that I would need to carry on with my life (my social life, sports, things that kept me sane).   
  
We had a challenging initial week as things had been so fraught and on eggshells for so long, and I had deliberately pulled back so as not to get into this dependence-cycle. But we argued constantly and after a final argument where she cried asking what had she done to me that was so bad for me to be like this with her, my heart broke and I proactively changed how I was being distant. We then had 3 super fun weeks as friends, though we spent arguably too much time together, but I was still able to get on with most things that I wanted to. 

She then left in December, and in a quick turn of events, I ended up also moving back to Europe (different country to her) to be with my family and sister. Since she left, she has been in an extremely dark place, according to her darker than ever before. She is back living with her mother who has some mental health issues, her father abandoned them when she was young, and while she has friends back home, she doesn't seem to see them much or rely on them.   
  
Over the years I have urged her to get professional help - and it's always the same. She says it can't help her or fix her. I try to help with practical suggestions of going on walks, trying new coffee spots, keep doing her skincare which she loves, and also suggesting that she mind-map the things she is feeling in order to make sense of everything and to help know where to start. She says everything feels so interconnected and unfixable.

She knows that a few months back the way things got were too much for me to handle and I had to take distance. She has not been proactively telling me how awful she feels but when I check in to see how she is doing, the floodgates can open and she will tell me 'I don't see the point in life', 'I'm tired of life', 'I don't have anyone except you' etc. 

It is too much for me. I love her dearly as a friend and when she's good we have the best time. But it feels toxic, it feels like I enable her by trying to help her or fix it and when I tried to set boundaries she tells me that she's not asking for anything, just for me to be there how she would be there for me. 

If I am the only person she has, I cannot abandon her, but I feel my own mental health starting to sink again, and I cannot be in this endless toxic cycle forever. I truly don't know what to do. She won't get help, I can't provide the help she needs, and at this point I want to be able to simply listen but it feels too much and like too much is being put on me (even though she isn't intentionally). 

Please help, I truly don't know what to do. There feels like no answer - if I take space, she feels abandoned and like I'm a fair-weather friend. If I support her, I find myself drowning. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation, whether in my shoes or in hers, I would be so grateful for any advice.",1,1767016994.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I work on a L&D unit where the day shift regularly comes in and throws away any food or drinks left on the breakroom table without asking and without notice while we're doing our last-minute chaos runs pre-handoff. I've had work-friends lose fresh coffee, desserts/snacks, and meals. Well, it was a matter of time before it happened to me. This morning my $20 salad that I had sitting next to my lunch bag (completely sealed and full) was tossed! I'm frankly annoyed and have no clue how to approach this professionally? I feel like I was did dirty, but what could tattling to management do? It won't bring my $20 or delicious meal back. I was too irritated and filterless from a long shift this morning to say anything because I probably would have probably been a jerk about it. 

Additionally, day shift pretty consistently leaves their food out for days on end and on nights we are too busy to clear their stuff, but if we leave out a fresh coffee or a salad 15 minutes before change of shift they will throw it away and then complain to management that we are leaving our food out like wild animals.

1pymznj,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1pymznj/39_m4a_online_who_else_is_back_to_work_today/,"39 [M4A] #Online - Who else is back to work today, feeling like you'd rather be at a dental checkup?","The holidays were so weird this year, I feel.

I find myself back at work (I'm EST in the US) today and I have been here less than half an hour and already over it all. I'm ready to give up all my earthly possessions and go live off the land, somewhere deep in the woods. Not really. I would last all of 6 hours if I did that. 

As a near 40-year old male, I find it incredibly difficult to meet new friends. What are people in our age demographic supposed to do? I tried hanging around a bookstore, hoping to find someone, but now I'm not allowed within 50 feet of the place because apparently, ""begging people who walk into the bookstore to talk to you, while on your knees and offering beverages"" is a crime? Ppssshh. 

I wish I could tempt you to talk to me by telling you all these cool adventures I have. All these hobbies that are super unique and cool. But, alas, it's not like that. I'm a fairly normal individual as far as to what a man my age is into. Think of most cliche hobbies of a man in the middle of his life and there's a good chance I'm into it. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

\- Hovering around the couch, watching TV, without actually sitting down

\- Finding WW2 ""really interesting""

\- Checking gas prices at all the local gas stations before feeling up because, a penny saved is a penny earned

\- Turning on a movie after 7:00pm, only to fall asleep about 20 minutes into it

\- Smoking / grilling all sorts of meats even when the temperature is too cold outside

  
In all actuality, I am a rare bird in the sense that I THINK I have an impressive understanding of what makes me FEEL. I don't mind talking about my feelings. I also happen to be a student of human nature; I pay attention to all the things that you DON'T say, and draw conclusions on who you REALLY are. It's a blessing and a curse.

When it comes down to the brass tacks of it, I'm a guy who enjoys good music, good food, and enjoying the little things in life. I don't need to go vacation every summer or do much to have a good time. At night I like picking up a good book and getting lost for an hour or so before bed, and I always grab an energy drink before I leave for work because I wasted so much time playing with my dogs that I don't have time to make a cup of coffee before I head out the door.

So here’s the situation. 👋🏿

I have feelings for a friend.👉🏿👈🏿  As is normal. Not mild ones. Not “eh maybe.” Actual feelings that make someone imagine folding laundry together. 

He’s in town for a short while and keeps insisting we meet for coffee. Says it’s casual. Friendly. No big deal. Totally clueless. 🤦🏿

Last time we met for “coffee,” we ended up spending the whole afternoon together. Small table. Knees touching the entire time. Not in a flirty planned way. Just… there was no space. And we didn’t move away either.

Now he wants to meet again and I’m already spiralling. 🤣

Is it overthinking to be scared that my feelings will just grow if I see him? Because that’s honestly my biggest fear. I know myself. I attach. I read into body language. I replay moments. I romanticise crumbs.I latch on like a parasite feeding on affection. 

Part of me thinks I should just say it outright. Confess that I have feelings so I’m not pretending I’m chill and casual when I’m not. Another part of me thinks that’s a terrible idea and will either make things awkward or leave me exposed if he doesn’t feel the same.

Taylor Swift said, 'My advice is always ruin the friendship.'

So… Reddit, help me out. (Please don't be brutal. I'm just a girl looking for love and maybe jollof/pilau)

1. Is meeting for coffee when you still have feelings a bad idea?

2. Is confessing feelings brave or just self-sabotage?
Or am I being dramatic and this is actually normal adult behaviour?

3. Be honest. I need outside brains because mine is doing calisthenics.
 
4. Is there a chance he also has feelings... Someone help my delulu. Lol.

It as really cool. We met at a very chilled out coffee shop and spent the next 3 hours delving into everything *pen* and it was really cool. He fixed these two pens' bladders and showed me some REALLY cool pens. And that's where it gets really interesting.

He's not just an esteemed member of our community, but he's also a seller of modified vintage pens. Did someone say URUSHI? How bout raden & eggshell? 

I was blown away by the quality of the craftsmanship on the artwork of the pens he showed me.

His studio works with vintage pens, mostly European and American, however, they can work with any and all makes & models. Raden, eggshell, maki-e and urushi are all painstakingly applied to each pen until it becomes a totally unique one-of-a-kind work of art.

I wasn't able to buy any at this time, but I do now have a target for a goal of 2026 to buy one because when his studio becomes better known it's definitely going to go up in price by a lot (thats just how it tends to work with growth).
Anyway, long story short, great meeting you u/ghastlysun and it was a pleasure!

To anyone reading, check out his stuff. I believe its called Lacquerman Studio but i could be wrong. If you're into urushi at all, you'll be pretty impressed by what he's got.

I’m 22M and my father is 62, we currently live together. I have my own car, he owns two; ever since I got my own car, he stopped using his cars and only used mine because it’s more convenient for him. I have no issue with that because it never caused any issues before. I don’t know shit about cars so I don’t know anything except for the fact he owns a big car that is hard to park in the city compared to mine (smaller), and a smaller car that has been broken for months but that he refuses to fix because “I can use yours anyway”. 

The day before Christmas, I was supposed to drive my mother to her christmas dinner. 
This is a bit embarrassing, but I have a really strong love-hate relationship with driving. I suffer from chronic migraines and sometimes I just can’t drive because I also get aura, and sometimes I feel so bad that it makes me very anxious about driving, especially at night. Family dinners can be a bit stressful, so I was absolutely dead after the dinner, and I decided not to drive home but leave my car at my mother’s place (12 mins drive). Another key event: on my way to the dinner, the car stopped, started smelling really bad and made a horrible noise, and then kept going as if nothing happened. I didn’t want to deal with that at the moment but it kinda pissed me off.

Two days later (26/12), my father asks me to pick up the car because he needs it to buy groceries, since he felt uncomfortable going with his own car. I wasn’t feeling well at all, so I told that I couldn’t, but that if he urgently needed the car, my mother could’ve picked him up and took him to my car. He said no because he thought it was ridiculous that I wasn’t up to a 12 minutes drive to take the car home and I was just making up excuses and I had to go there and do it. Touchè, I could’ve just sucked it up, but I couldn’t quite understand why since it wasn’t an urgency.
Another day passes, same story. 
Another day passes. I tell him that around 9/10 PM I’ll pick up the car. He doesn’t believe me anymore. He gets mad because because of me he couldn’t buy groceries for 2 days, and that ruined his whole 2 days. So he leaves the house, and shops for groceries with his own car and comes back.
He tells me I don’t need to pick up the car anymore because he will do it himself since he doesn’t trust me anymore, and he starts yelling at me that I deeply disappointed him, that I’m a spoiled egocentric brat and that he asked me to do a very simple thing and I ruined his week in return etc. 
He called my aunt in front of me to complain about how useless I was basically and to ask her to pick him up to take my car. He said that it wasn’t necessary anymore because he was going to do it because he was “too used to disappointment” and I ruined his professional life because the following day he wanted to go to work with my car, so it was too late to fix it.
I want to prove him wrong, so I leave the house to go pick up that damn car… he stops me. He starts a whole talk about how I don’t do him any favours, never show him appreciation etc and do nothing but betray him when I do stuff like this. Then he started saying some stuff about me not being allowed to drink his coffee anymore since I don’t appreciate who pays for it etc.
I don’t understand if maybe I was being too difficult with this car thing and maybe I should’ve just been less of a pussy and dealt with it immediately? He did ask me to use my car and I just kinda did nothing till the very last day, but at the same time I don’t understand why he wanted to use my car so badly when he has his own…? It just feels like a very ridiculous fight, but he took it very personally and says he won’t be able to trust me ever if I keep up with this attitude and I don’t want that honestly.",3,1767016462.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Explaining a concept like manifestation to a child is like trying to teach your cat algebra—highly unlikely to end well.

Parents want their kids to *believe* in themselves and also figure out how to *make things happen*. But the gap between intention and action? It’s wide.

Cue the internal monologue: “Am I doing enough to guide them?” “Are we just winging it here?”

Sound familiar?

If you've ever wondered how to help your child dream big without serving them a side of confusion, you're not alone.

[Go for Your Goals](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official) offers something helpful: a way to show children how their thoughts connect with what they do—all in a format that’s fun, engaging, and doesn’t come with glittery nonsense or vague pep talks.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Go for Your Goals  
**Category:** Parenting Tools → Personal Development for Kids  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.5/5

So, you're interested in **how to teach manifestation to kids**, visualizing outcomes, and setting goals they can actually follow through on. That's the aim of this digital bundle.

Parents aren’t thrown into the deep end either. The program includes a **parenting guide that builds confidence in children**, showing you how to talk about self-belief without sounding like a corporate coach in a kid’s birthday hat.

It’s got books, games, videos, audio—and none of it feels like homework. The focus? Helping children develop healthy habits through **goal-setting activities families can do together**.

# 📚 What's in the Package?

The package includes three eBooks: two for different age groups and one for adults. Each one showcases **self-help lessons designed for kids** in a way that makes sense to their developing brains.

There’s also an audiobook version of the Parent’s Guide. That’s great if you’re the type who prefers listening during laundry folding marathons or sneaky solo walks.

Nine videos are also included, exploring topics like **how to teach kids self-belief**, build focus, and make big goals feel small enough to act on.

Don’t skip the 10 printable activities. They include the Rainforest Board Game and the Mind Maze Challenge, which are great **tools to help kids stay motivated and focused** without boredom setting in.

If you're looking for **interactive goal-setting tools for young learners**, the activities hit that sweet spot between learning and play.

# 🧠 How It Actually Works

This isn’t a plug-and-play app. You’ll be involved. And that’s a good thing. Parents are instrumental in turning those **visualization techniques for young kids** into [real habits](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official).

The system supports both **fun goal-setting activities for kids and parents** and moments where you're sitting together and talking about their dreams.

You won't need to overthink the language. The scripts in the Parent’s Guide make it easy **to explain visualization to a child** without turning it into a TED Talk.

Age-based customization means younger kids and older ones aren’t lumped into the same learning track. That keeps **goal-setting ideas for elementary students** sharp and specific.

# 🌱 What Kids Learn

This program supports character-building through play, stories, and open discussion. It’s especially helpful for kids who need a little boost in the confidence department.

You'll explore **positive affirmations for kids to achieve their goals** in the form of repeating short statements, writing them down, or including them in games.

The stories are simple but relatable. We really liked the fact that the **manifestation stories were written for children** without drifting into fantasy land.

The lessons in **beginner-friendly manifestation for children** engage participants through activities that focus on taking action—not just thinking positive thoughts and hoping for unicorns.

It’s a sweet spot between mindset and action, without sounding preachy or academic.

And if your child is learning from home, you'll find this is one of the better **homeschool resources for teaching the law of attraction**.

# 👩‍🎨 Simone’s Real-World Experience ...

My friend **Simone**, a former art therapist who now runs creative mindset workshops for kids in the community center near my place, tried [Go for Your Goals](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official) after I mentioned it during one of our coffee catch-ups.

She’s got a real talent for helping anxious or shy kids express themselves through storytelling and drawing, so I figured she’d be the perfect person to give this a go with her Monday afternoon group.

She printed the worksheets and brought the younger kids’ eBook into one of her “vision board” classes.

Instead of her usual drawing prompts, she used the jungle-themed story as a launchpad. One kid, usually silent and withdrawn, perked up and said he wanted to “be a bird so I can be brave and fast.”

Simone told me it was the most he'd ever spoken in front of the group. That moment alone sold her on the value of this content.

They also tried the Rainforest Board Game together. She said the kids were obsessed—half the group didn’t want to stop playing, even after snack time.

They didn’t even realize they were discussing their goals out loud. It was subliminal learning at its best.

Her only complaint? The visuals in the videos didn’t hold the older kids’ attention as well—some of them drifted off when it wasn’t interactive.

But for the younger ones, it worked like a charm. Simone's verdict: it blended right into her program like it belonged there all along.

1pymt18,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1pymt18/i_want_my_parents_out_of_my_life_it_shouldnt_be/,I want my parents out of my life. It shouldn't be wrong to feel this way.,"And I don't mean this to put them down, I know they try their best over the years, they were absolutely fantastic parents, up until a whole bunch of stuff happened this year with my substance abuse issues, but all I can see it's entirely my fault, another just some things my parents will say, that upsets me. 

I've repeatedly asked my mom, please do not tell me ""it has nothing to do with us!"" Whenever I tell her that I wasn't paid, or that my disability money was delayed. Because it's annoying hearing it 10,000 times over. ""Nothing to do with us, nothing to do with us!"" 

I don't care if she's objectively correct, I don't need to hear it repeated every time I tell her that I'm out of money. I didn't even ask her for any, I just told her I didn't get paid, and that would frustrate anybody. It's even worse because I'm mentally disabled and live on ODSP, and they pay me on LATER days? (Would be a lot cooler if it was earlier like it had been at sometimes but it's really hit or miss and the unpredictability I'm not cool with), imo it's fucking retarded to pay me LATER. 

My money comes in usually on the 1st and 15th, and both times this month, the money was not in at 3:00 a.m. like it was supposed to, however I did go into the business myself, and they were able to give me about $110 extra cash, but when I ran into my friend at 7-Eleven, of the $60 they gave me, I gave him 40 of the 60 bringing me down the 20. 

This is what they get upset with... 

What my mom (whore-a-bull bitch) continues to say is ""It has nothing to do with us!"" whenever I tell them that my money hasn't came in yet. 

My parents think there's such good people, but the objective truth is they're alcoholics who shit on people who smoke weed and I'm both an alcoholic and a pothead. 

My Dad (subjective retard) on August 4, 2014 (when I was 19, will be 31 in the NY'26): ""I don't use drugs, and have never used drugs!"" 

Bill Hicks: if I were to legalize a DRUG it sure wouldn't have been alcohol. Also my dad drinks coffee so caffeine and alcohol are two so it's plural bitch. 

My parents were very smart for thinking marijuana was a very bad substance, it absolutely can be for many people and it certainly ruined my life. Haven't said that, they are hypocritical bastards. 

I never want to speak to my parents again, I'm not sorry at all that I feel this way, for how they have treated me from 2020 onward. Between 1995 and 2019? They were absolutely great parents! Between 2020 and now, not only have they not helped, they've also have done the opposite of help in a resulted in me getting into a fight with my dad earlier this year, the police were called (by me) but I'm not allowed on their property anymore, nor my older middle brother down the road from them. 

They have absolutely no idea how horrible my life has been, but because I was sending $100 out to a friend in Alberta every two weeks or about twice a month, who I'm now labeling as a parasite. I sent them $2,400 this year, on top of another $2,400 to beer and weed each. That's $7,200 a year! 

If my ""friend"" (parasite) gave me the money back that I gave him, I'll be absolutely loving life right now but because he's such a worthless human being, my life is shit. 

She unblocked me just because I sent him money. I can totally get not giving me money, but blocking me? because I sent him money? She is a fucking female dog asf. My dad wouldn't care. 

She tried telling me that I can't tell her what to do, but when I told her that she tells me what to do she tried hanging up the phone and saying she was going to block me again and I started screaming at her NO DON'T. 

If I'm get arrested, it's going to be because my mom said something stupid that triggered me, knowing it upsets me but does it anyway because she ignores several important factors. ",1,1767016297.0,toxicparents,0,0.99,False

1pymr78,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pymr78/my_grandfathers_teeth/,My Grandfather's Teeth,"The holidays are always a very confusing time for me. I love the decorations, the festive mood, but I also feel a melancholy nostalgia that lingers in the back of my mind. Not a yearning for younger times, but vague childhood trauma and family inadequacies bubbling to the surface. My sister and I individually still live in our hometown. My parents do too, and so did my grandparents. I have no desire to move, I do really like it here. That doesn’t mean though that I’m not affected by the proximity of parts of my past.

I practice Wicca in a modern, cultural sense. I was raised loosely Catholic, and I still celebrate Christmas. But I also celebrate the Wiccan sabbat of Yule which overlaps with Christmas. It’s nice to be able to have something to share while also having something for “yourself” to enjoy and experience. This year’s holidays were different though. Surprising, but not shocking, my grandfather died.

He was ninety-two, so his passing was not unexpected. Active and mentally alert up until the very end, but still, ninety-two. Just the timing of being so close to the holidays was not foreseen in the brief overview of planning for his passing that my parents, sister, and I happened to discuss earlier in the year. Getting funeral arrangements made for December 20th was a pain, but we got it done. We made it simple. A public wake and a private funeral. Of my family, I was the closest to my grandfather and I felt treating his death arrangements in a more logical, left-brain matter just made sense and wasn’t insensitive at all. He would have wanted people to move on quickly and continue with their lives.

I learned of Wicca from my grandfather. Many people are surprised to hear that being Wiccan, or a witch, is not just some New Age fade. My grandmother was Wiccan too. My mother, their daughter, decided not to practice which is of course totally fine and her decision. I decided though that Wicca really aligned with my values and felt best for me. Cooking, especially baking is a main aspect of my practice. Since I was a kid my grandfather and I would bake together in his big kitchen. Savory or sweet galettes (depending on the season), witch’s bread pudding using buttery brioche bread, and much more. Nine out of ten times, we made perfect creations.

Wicca is very much individual-centered. While my grandfather and I practiced together, he also encouraged me to develop my own practice for myself as he did his own. When my grandmother died three years ago, it was nice to see that he had a “system” in place for himself to process the grief in a healthy way. What exactly that system was when he was alone, I’m unsure. But it was his, and it worked for him.

Speaking of speedy death arrangements, I happened to get a call from my grandfather’s lawyer maybe 10 minutes after the funeral. He wanted to go over my grandfather’s will. He was able to arrange a meeting for my family and I to come into his office the following day. The convenience was very nice.

We all sat down in front of the attorney’s desk. “It’s honestly one of the most simplified wills I’ve ever been designated to carry out,” the lawyer said. “As he stated in his will, you are already aware he is donating most of his money to charities and causes he cared deeply about. However, he left $10,000 total to divide amongst the four of you equally.” Thankfully, we all understood and acknowledged that we knew this well in advance. No one contested it. The lawyer handed each of us a check for $2,500. The lawyer proceeded.

“The only thing left is this.” The lawyer lifted up onto his desk a small, old wooden chest that was maybe a foot wide and half a foot tall. The dark brown of the wood was almost black, which matched the black metal of the hinges, lock, and corner edge plating. “This is for you Zack.” The lawyer handed me the chest. My family looked at me inquisitively but said nothing. Right there I tried to open the chest, but it was locked.

“Is there a key?” I asked. “No” the lawyer replied firmly. The lawyer then stated that my mother was designated as the executor of his “estate” or what would happen with the rest of his belongings like his home. That concluded the will distribution and the lawyer ushered us out the door because he assumingly had other things to do.

The plan was we would all get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at my parents’ house, which was normal for us unfortunately. I drove back to my place. I put my keys down in the bowl by the door and took the chest into the kitchen where I placed it on the dining room table. I made myself a mug of herbal tea and then sat in front of the chest, thinking. Should I try to pick the lock? Do I try and pry it open?

I gently shook the chest. I couldn’t hear anything inside. Was it just decorative? That doesn’t seem like something my grandfather would leave in a will. Wicca tends to be utilitarian, and that’s how my grandfather was. Practical, but not in an emotionally detached way at all. He didn’t like giving or receiving gifts. He liked to show his care by providing experiences, acts of service, words of affection. Baking was a clear example of giving an experience of the senses.

I left the chest on the table and decided to light a fire in the fireplace. Some find it contradictory, or a dichotomy? I don’t know. Anyway, people find it weird that I use natural kindling from the woods but put one of those pre-packaged logs you light on top of it. To continue the theme of Wicca, I think it’s a perfect representation of the practice. “Old” and “new” together. I lit the fire, and it immediately went up in a roar and then settled down. It’s a traditional fireplace, it doesn’t use major flammables like gas. The wood must have been really dry? A moment after the fire settled, I heard a thud come from the kitchen. I got a little scared. Just in case, I grabbed the fire poker hanging near the fireplace and slowly walked to the kitchen.

Stepping into the room I looked around. Nothing was there. The door that connected the garage to the kitchen that I normally walk through was closed, and so were the windows. I looked over at the dining room table and saw the chest. That, was open. I walked over to it and looked inside. I had to blink a few times to make sure nothing was in my eyes, and that what I was seeing was actually what I was seeing. There were eleven teeth scattered within the chest.

A shiver shot up my spine. Teeth? Real human teeth? How did I not hear at least a rattling when I shook the chest? The question in itself made me uncomfortable. Whose teeth were they? I had to assume they were my grandfather’s. Where else would he get human teeth? I thought of the worst possible scenario. Did he hurt someone to get these? I was just being paranoid in the moment. I never saw my grandfather get even remotely angry at anything. I don’t think I ever even saw him slightly irritated. Is that a good trait, or the trait of a psychopath?

I needed to calm down. I know my grandfather. Horribly, these had to be his teeth, and the coroner or funeral staff didn’t notify us because, for some odd reason, they didn’t see his missing teeth as abnormal. Maybe they just thought he had poor dental hygiene? There was a part of me that wanted to pick them up and inspect them, but the shock was still subsiding in me, so I didn’t. 

It’s an old chest. It must have been spring-loaded and broken open. I left the open chest there and decided to bring my tea over to the couch near the fireplace and just relax. I would try reading a book I was almost done with and organize my thoughts about this discovery after. I decided not to tell my parents and sister. At least not so close to Christmas. Again, I already feel weird around my family this time of year. It’s not an emergency, and I wouldn’t want to sour their Christmas and create more tension just like I wouldn’t want my Yule shaken up like that. If I was going to tell them what Grandpa left me, I would wait until after the holidays.

Only three to five pages into reading, I started to smell a really pungent odor. It wasn’t bad-smelling, just really strong. It was cinnamon. I didn’t add anything to my tea. I thought maybe some of the wood I was burning could be producing a smell? I went over to the fireplace, but it wasn’t that. I remembered I had mini cinnamon brooms hanging outside each of my house’s doors. I thought that was ridiculous, because how could they suddenly become that strong in smell, but I checked anyway. 

I opened the front door and the cinnamon smell hit me like a wave. Yes, it was ever so clear that it was coming from the cinnamon brooms. When I bought them, you literally had to put your nose up to them to smell the slight scent they held. Now, it was as though the scent radiated off them like a nuclear reactor. I checked the one outside the connecting garage door, and it too was overwhelming.

For those that don’t know, in Wicca, it’s tradition to hang a cinnamon or spiced broom outside your door during the colder seasons’ sabbats, especially Samhain/Halloween and Yule. It’s a very contemplative time of the year. The brooms protect your home from “bad energy” and ground you in the physical realm while the veil between life and death is thin. They’re symbolic. The same concept applied to lighting fires in the fireplace.

Whether you notice it or not, air circulates through homes constantly. Air pressure changes simply by opening and closing doors. My home is on the older side so I thought there must have been a particular draft where a wind was strongly wafting in the scent of the brooms toward my house and then through tight spaces even though the doors and windows were closed. I really couldn’t think of any other rational way. I went back to reading.

I finished my book. Albert Camus’ “The Fall.” I liked “The Stranger” better, but overall this was a good read too. It was around 9:00pm. The glowing fire had relaxed me with its light flickering within the room. However, that feeling left. My heart sank a little. I remembered I needed to do something with the chest of teeth. I turned and saw it on the table. With the lights off it mainly just looked like a darker black spot within an already dark room. I finished my tea which was cold at this point. I decided to just leave the chest there. I’ll get a good night’s sleep and figure out what to do with it tomorrow. I put out the fire with cold ashes, showered, and went to bed.

I jolted up, leaning forward in bed. I had woken up feeling panic. I checked my phone, it was 3:30am. There was silence. Did I have a nightmare? I took a few deep breaths. As I was going to lay back down, I heard a faint sound. It went away after a few seconds. I heard it again. I was certain it was the sound of children giggling. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from outside or somewhere inside the house.

I checked my phone again. I didn’t accidentally have any audio playing. I thought it must be the Alexa playing something downstairs. I got out of bed and the immediate feel of the cold wood floors on the bottoms of my feet added to the tension in the air. I have a semi-auto shotgun in my room’s gun locker but I felt getting it out, at this point, would be excessive. I was overthinking. I slowly made my way down the stereotypically creaky stairs.

Not even fully down the stairs I saw the red light from the Alexa which means I indeed did not forget to turn it off/mute before bed. No sound was playing. The on-and-off sound of children giggling had stopped. The pungent smell of cinnamon still filled the air downstairs. I turned the living room and kitchen lights on and began to look around. On the kitchen counter next to the stove, my bag of baking flour was sitting there, open. The windows and doors were still closed and locked. I looked outside the front and back windows. No one was out there. Nothing was disturbed or out of place, minus the bag of flour being out. I then saw the chest on the counter, of course still sitting there.

I went over to it. I felt a desire to see its contents again, still not believing what the chest held. Looking inside, I saw it was completely empty. The teeth were gone. The doors and windows began to shake violently. I could hear the hinges rattling, but they stood strong. The child laughter came back loud. I realized the laughter was coming from outside the house, all around. It was utter chaos. It felt like a fever dream. Clearly, it was now not excessive to go get my gun. I ran upstairs, got it out of the safe, and ran back downstairs. I didn’t know where to look. The laughter was coming from the doors, the windows, the roof, everywhere, but I could see nothing. Then, as quickly as it came, it was silent. The doors and windows stopped shaking. The laughter stopped. The cinnamon smell dissipated. I stood there, in a sweat, holding my shotgun. I felt scared yet relieved at the same time. 

I don’t like the police. People roll their eyes at me when I say it, but I believe in community self-defense. I did not call them to report this, nor was I in the mood to go outside and investigate. Maybe this was a deranged, elaborate prank from neighborhood kids… who I didn’t know lived on this street. Maybe I was hallucinating. I went to the kitchen where I keep my medication to check that I hadn’t missed any doses, or taken more than I should have by accident. I happened to see the bottle of melatonin I recently bought. 10mg. Of course. I usually take 3mg tablets and only take melatonin occasionally. I must have not been paying attention when I bought it, and forgotten that I took some melatonin before bed and my body was reacting strangely negative. I’m always sensitive like that. I literally have to stop drinking coffee at least eight to nine hours before bed because of the caffeine.

I double-checked the doors just to soothe my mind. They were still locked. So were the windows. I even checked the chimney shoot. That was closed too. I left everything as it was. The lights on, the flour bag, the chest, I just left it as is. I went back upstairs and put my gun away. I laid my head to rest. It took me about an hour to go back to bed, but I eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I showered, got dressed, and went downstairs. Everything was fine. The lights were off and the flour bag was in the kitchen cupboard. The doors and windows were still closed and locked. I made some coffee and went to head out to run some errands. Right as I was leaving, a thought entered my mind. The missing teeth. I went over to the chest and looked inside. The teeth were back where they were. Well, I figured they were always there. I figured everything was what and where it normally was. The melatonin just messed me up last night. I brushed it off and left the house.

I came back home about an hour and a half later. There were still some leaves falling from the trees from Fall, so I went outside and did some raking. The crisp, cold air was refreshing and cleared my lungs. I paused for a moment. It was a nice feeling, but the air had a density to it. No, more so a very slight vibration. A presence. An anticipation lingering in the background. I chopped it up to the weird seasonal imbalance. Fall holding on tight, not letting Winter fully sink in. Climate destruction making every year warmer. I finished raking, put the paper bags of leaves on the curb, and went inside.

I made another fire in the fireplace and got cozy with a new book. It got dark quickly. Shortly into reading, the fire did a roar. It was the same quick blaze that occurred when I lit it the day before but now just on its own, not right when I lit it. I thought that I needed to be more careful with the wood I chose because it was getting dangerous. Maybe 30 seconds after that, the giggling started. The children’s laughter slowly began to surround the house. I quickly accepted that this wasn’t last night’s excuse I told myself. This wasn’t just me.

I got up and headed toward the front door to investigate when my grandfather’s box on the table, which I continued to not do something about, began to shake in its place. I slowly walked up to it. It shook violently. The teeth, again, were gone. The doors and windows began to shake again. The children’s laughter grew and got louder. The scent of the cinnamon brooms became overwhelming. I ran upstairs and again grabbed my gun. When I came back downstairs, rushed to the door, and almost turned the doorknob, something stopped me. I felt a sudden feeling that stopped me in my place “telling” me not to open the door. A part of me wanted to proceed, but I continued to feel the sudden emotion guiding me to stay inside. Do not open the door.

I walked backward to the center of the room and just stood there. I let everything just occur. The fire roared again but continued blazing instead of the one-quick burst it had done twice before. The chest shook even more violently, and so did the doors and windows. The stench of the cinnamon stung my nostrils. The children’s laughter increasingly became deeper and deeper until it sounded purely demonic. It was booming all throughout the outside of the house. I just stood there. I stood in my place and protected my home. If it, whatever it was, came inside, I would defend myself. I had no other choice.

Amongst the cacophony, another sound did manage to make itself known. The short, clear ding of my oven’s timer. As it did its single ring, everything stopped. The fire went back to normal. The chest, doors, and windows stopped shaking. The cinnamon scent died off. The laughter was gone. I went back over to the chest, and the teeth had returned. It was all over. What was also there was the bag of flour, back on the kitchen counter.

For the rest of the Yule season, I left the chest open on the table. The day Yule ended, I closed the chest and put it on the shelf in the living room closet. My grandfather taught me when I was younger of the Yule children. Some Wiccan cultures like witches in Iceland call them the “Yule Lads.” I was always taught of them as strictly a symbolic tale to uplift the idea of protective energy in your home. I was told the group of at least thirteen “mischievous” children were from a witch couple that practiced “dark magic.” They were supposedly the souls of children who did not pass over due to random accidents or unexplained reasons, from parents of those in a nearby village of the witches who lived in the woods or mountains (depending on which recollection). The witches would call to the spirits to stay with them, and these thirteen did. Eventually, the witch couple suddenly died. It is said they sacrificed themselves to some entity, unknown.

I had Christmas with my family and went back to my normal life. What else could I do? Call the police? What I experienced was what I experienced. It was real. People experience supernatural events all the time. Some true, and some fake or misinterpreted. This was no Wiccan myth. Instead, I saw it as a positive and profound event that, if anything, confirmed for myself my spiritual practice even more. It was a miracle. Months passed, and the Halloween season came around. My favorite sabbat, Samhain.

I was in the kitchen baking to really bring a warm feeling to the home on a chilly Fall night. I could hear the wind rustling the leaves outside. It was really nice. I put the dish into the oven and set the timer. Then, the sound of slight shaking occurred. I walked into the living room to see where the sound was coming from. I listened. It was coming from the closet. I walked over to the closed closet door. Yes, it was coming from inside. I knew it was the chest. It had to be.

I just stood there. I didn’t know what to do. Do I bring the chest back out on the table? Do I leave it where it is and let whatever happens, happen? I just really didn’t know what to do. I still don’t know what to do with my Grandfather’s teeth.",1,1767016159.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

From that burning desperation to the quiet, steady fire that just simmers in the background. I’ve messed up, got ghosted, got attached, unlearned and relearned, read about attachment styles and I’m still very much a work in progress.

I don’t spend hours on the phone waiting for matches anymore. I’ve started living my life and investing in myself instead. But, the feeling of being single keeps creeping back in.

Sometimes, I go to the same local coffee shop and chill by myself. I never understood how people sip on their coffees for hours. I gulp mine down in a minute and then end up people-watching.

A guy walked in and sat at the table across from me. Our eyes met for a second and the awkwardness made me look everywhere, but at him. Funny how I’ve swiped through hundreds of profiles, but when a real life person is sitting right in front of me, I suddenly don’t know what to do with my hands or where to look. 

With my coffee finished and my people-watching ruined by my own awkwardness, I got up and left. Walking out, I felt that familiar pang of hopelessness that comes with wondering where is my person? What has Allah written for me? Is he out there going through his own phases of waiting, growing and stumbling? Or have our timelines been set so far apart that by the time we meet, my playful side will already be worn down?Sometimes I wonder if I’ll still have the spark to banter, to laugh freely, to share that kind of easy, organic vibe. What if life dulls that spark before I ever get the chance to share it with the right one?

It’s a hard feeling to sit with. Balancing faith in Allah’s plan while fighting the fear of uncertainty. ",1,1767016060.0,u_Historical_Leg123,0,1.0,False
1pympkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Wallaby_9624/comments/1pympkj/i_stopped_overthinking_smoothies_after_following/,I stopped overthinking smoothies after following Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide,"[](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/healthy-spinach-smoothies-summer/)For a long time, smoothies were an on-again, off-again habit for me. I’d be consistent for a week, feel great, then get bored, confused, or annoyed that my smoothies were either too sweet, not filling, or just… random. I knew smoothies *could* be healthy, but I didn’t know how to make them work every single day without turning it into a project.

That’s what made me look into **Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide**. I wasn’t looking for one “perfect” recipe — I wanted a system that actually fits normal life.

What clicked right away is that **Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide** isn’t about drinking the same green smoothie forever. It’s about understanding balance: protein, fiber, healthy fats, and fruit working together so your smoothie feels like a real meal or a smart snack — not sugar water.

I started using smoothies intentionally:

* Breakfast on rushed mornings
* Lunch backup when work got hectic
* Afternoon energy boost instead of coffee + snacks

After about a week, a few things changed:

* I stayed full longer
* Fewer random cravings
* More consistent energy
* Less decision fatigue around food

That’s where **Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide** really helped — it removed the guesswork. Instead of asking “what should I blend today?” I knew how to adjust based on my needs (more protein, lighter option, gut-friendly, etc.).

I also learned what *doesn’t* work. Smoothies that are mostly fruit spike hunger fast. Skipping protein makes them feel pointless. And adding everything in the fridge just leads to weird results. Once I stuck to the principles in **Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide**, my smoothies became reliable instead of hit-or-miss.

I followed this guide here: [**Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/healthy-smoothie-for-every-day-recipes-tips-plan/). What I appreciated most is that it includes recipes *and* a simple plan, so smoothies don’t feel like a short-term phase.

Do smoothies magically fix your diet? No. But using **Healthy Smoothie for Every Day: The Ultimate Guide** made healthy eating easier, not harder — which is honestly the only way habits stick.

Now I keep a few freezer staples on hand and rotate smoothies based on my day instead of forcing myself into one routine.

Curious — do you use smoothies daily, or do you eventually get bored and fall off like I used to?

For breakfast, I had coconut water and apples. After that, I took a bath and washed my hair. Then I went back to the terrace again to get more sunlight, because I love the sun, and honestly, why not. While sitting there, I ate some oranges. They were a little bitter, but they smelled very fresh.

Later, I made a sandwich for an evening snack and had it with coffee. Since then, I’ve been feeling nauseous. I’m not sure why.

I went back to the terrace once more, hoping it would help. I looked at the moon and the night sky. There were no birds this time — usually there are.

You just end up getting so much more done when you're not worried about traffic and weather and parking. As a bonus, it's easier to do little spontaneous things like stop by a cute bookstore in town, or grab a treat from a local coffee shop! Walking and being outside is just a normal part of your life instead of a planned activity you need to intentionally set aside time for.

People's biggest argument seems to be centered around groceries, but stopping by the store on your way home for 15-20 minutes a few times a week is so much less disruptive than the hours long shopping trips where you have to buy absolutely everything you need. And you end up eating fresher, healthier food. I would much rather do that then spend my entire Sunday morning running errands.

But recently I was given an ultimatum.

I built a trading education business at 21, sold my share to my partner at 24. We had to never spend a dime to build it, service businesses require less capital flows.

I could do that because my family had a business that gave me security to do my own thing.

So after i sold my share, i decided to join the family business until the next thing. Never too bad to learn the ins and outs of your family business.

Last month i decided to leave the family business and venture out again.

My family has the capital and I have the skills. And whatever you dont have, you earn and learn on the way when you build something.

But something unique happened.

My dad gave me 2 choices:

\- Either to stay in the business

Or

\- To take my share and leave

No reverse, no coming back, or no leaving again.

Because my passion doesn't lie in what my family does, and after talking to my mentors and close friends, i decided to take my share and build something of my own.

But, here's the twist.

The moment i told my dad that I'm not going to be in it, and i am going to take my share and build something of my own, he decided to not give anything.

So the choice was essentially an illusion. It was basically, if you dont do it our way, you dont get anything. You're on your own :)

Hurts me but it's alright i guess.

So now, i am out of the family business, I am out of family wealth, I have moved to Delhi (from my hometown which is not Delhi ofc), and I am now looking for a job where I can contribute.

If anyone has any leads, I'd appreciate that.

If I can't have something of my own, then I'd help someone build something that they can call their own. It should just add value to the world. That's all that keeps me satisfied in whatever I do.

I'm an Economics grad (2020) from a reputed University in Mumbai, have a keen interest in financial markets, start-ups, Design (UX), and coffee. But I'm keen to learn whatever is needed to do whatever I'm needed to do to be useful in the role that I'm in.

Thanks for listening to my sob story, and a huge thanks for all the help that anyone would give here.

""Doesn't have kids/doesn't want any"" doesn't apply to single parents' children? Really? It should be common sense that it does apply.

Some of us aren't talking to multiple people at once. Please don't waste our time.

If you wait days to tell us, it's an indirect confession that you know it's a potential turnoff. All the more reason to tell us within the first few messages.

I'm sure loads of you had the same thing where everyone around you starts having kids or your family keeps asking about when are you going to give them grandchildren.

As for myself, I never liked kids because I find them too loud and annoying.  
Grew up within a very bad family situation, wish I never had a dad because he was an absolute psychopath while my mom is ultra religious (I'm not religious and grew up to be against the whole catholic church shit because I see how in majority of cases it brainwashes people and strips away any attempt to have their own opinion)  
On top of that, I've got ADHD so being overstimulated is almost an everyday situation.

I spent a lot of the time thinking about whether to have kids, is there something I am not seeing, something really great people who have them talk about etc.  
I was always more against it but couldn't help but wonder if there is something I am missing.

When talking about selfish motives, I am referring to things like ""so someone can take care of me when I get old"", ""to continue legacy"" while only legacy they have is minimal salary etc.

I've spent a week with my family for holidays and my sister in law has a 1yo kid.  
After staying at her place and spending time within that whole situation I haven't seen a single positive thing about having a kid, just confirming what I always thought.

1. Everything is miserable as fuck.

\- The parents are visibly exhausted and very obviously can not handle that one kid by themselves because there always needs to be someone else from the family that comes in and helps out.

2. No such thing as having any time for yourself

\- There is not a single minute of the day that kid can spend alone and I find that so exhausting. Constant fucking screaming, crying, having to tiptoe around the kid as that little dictates dictates everything. Do the opposite and your ears will bleed once they start screaming.

\- Another thing is that parents tend to let go of themselves a lot because that kid takes up all their time and energy. I absolutely understand it's a massive responsibility and of course you need to take care of your kid. It's a huge sacrifice and respect for that but from my pov, there's nothing good, fulfilling or fun about it.

3. No getting out of the situation

\- It's not a monthly subscription, it's a lifetime thing. Because of that there's no such thing like you coming home to peace and quiet. No, that chaos goes everywhere you go, you come home to it or with it.  
\- Then you hear the parents asking for help from their family to take care of the kid for sometime so they can ""rest"" or have some piece.  
If you wanted that kid so bad, how come ""getting rid of it"" is the only way for you to really enjoy your time, to rest and fill up your batteries?

4. Absolutely no freedom

\- You just can't do anything you like if it's not aligned to that kid's needs which could change any moment.  
Parents have no life of their own unless they have a bunch of family members willing to take the kid off their hands so they can do something.  
And even then if the kid starts crying for its mom, there's nothing you can do and then that mother needs to again cancel everything to get back because that kid demands it.

Wanna go for a walk or go grab a coffee on the way or something, you go outside, the kid starts crying or some shit and you gotta go back because that's just how it is.

5. Loss of identity

\- Because having a kid takes up 99.99% of parents time and thinking, there is no such thing as being an individual or a ""real"" person. Your life revolves around your kid so much that there is no you anymore.  
I have noticed this with other parents as well, the same people I knew before becoming parents were actual people with their own thoughts but now it's just ""my kid this"" and ""my kid that"" which just makes me wonder who are you then and where did you go?

6. Financial stress

\- If you're not insanely rich, you can't go by without being incredibly stressed and in constant overdrive.  
Parents have to work otherwise who's gonna pay the bills, feed that kid and get it best care and education that they deserve.

Why would you bring a kid in the world if you can barely afford taking care of your self in this terrible economy?

These are just some things I try to look from objective point of view but from my personal perspective there is way more like  
\- Sensory it is too much, I can't handle screaming, all the smells and crying for no reason

\- I hate having a mess at my home, seeing things first hand in a household with just one kid, there would be no such thing as having my own peaceful corner, everything is pure chaos

\- I hate kids songs, it is such an attack on your senses and feel like it is made to make you dumb basic person

\- I find it annoying when people loose their minds when they see kids. When you see their primitive instincts kick in and they just evolve backwards thinking you should give that kid everything and anything it wants, teaching them no boundaries.

\- I can't imagine completely loosing my sense of self and for a kid to become my whole identity, I just find it sad as hell

\- If I'd even consider have a kid, I would need to be so filthy fucking rich so they can have a nanny at any time needed and a tutor at their disposal. I am just not willing to give up all my time and my whole personality for a kid. Because of this I think I'd be a bad parent, further proving my point to not consider bringing a kid to this world since my only condition would be to have someone to take it away and take care of it 95% of the time.

I've seen a lot of comments like ""it's the most fulfilling thing you can do in your life"" but it honestly seems like the best they can think of to try and justify being miserable. Like it's the one thing preventing them from admitting having a kid crippled them and made their lives miserable.  
And I understand some would try to hold onto any kind of justification because that's their whole life now, and believing stuff like that prevents you from absolutely loosing your shit.  
But what I hate the most is when parents start talking shit to childless people about how they have it easy and they have it the hardest, like ""you don't understand it, you don't have kids"", like, who the fuck made you have them then?  
I understand it is insanely difficult but it was their choice.  
That constant need to play the martyr as if someone made them have kid is just not a valid argument. How about live with your choice instead of projecting on others who chose not to go down that same path which made you miserable in the first place?

Majority of highly educated people choose to not have kids because they actually have aspirations in life, which is also why I don't understand when people congratulate someone for being pregnant. Like, almost anyone can have unprotected sex, is that really the best you can do in your life?

We live in a world where nothing feels safe, especially for women. And to be a parent, based on my impressions so far, you need to be a type of person who is still kinda childish, naive and unaware of things to some extent.  
Most people I know who had kids had no other major aspirations in life but to procreate and are kind of a ""one-dimensional"" person so for them having a kid really is the best and most meaningful thing to do in life but I just can't relate to that in any way.",0,1767015367.0,GenZ,12,0.44,False

I'm looking for someone who will be my forever in this life, looking for serious relationship and my favourite person on life! 

I'm living in UK for many years I'm European originally, so I'd generally want to meet someone within flight or driving distance in the country, not afraid of distance and willing to commit to right person.

Something about me I'm single and forever alone and I hope to change that, just bad luck in life never had luck in love. 

I do travel a lot by myself and want to find someone who is equally curious about world, especially history of our Europe, I love old cities and small towns, villages.

I love animals a lot especially Cats and Capybaras are my favourite, but I like so many of them it's hard to put all! 

I am gaming so would be nice to have someone to do things together, mainly Battlefield, Total War: Warhammer, Resident Evil, Witcher 3, Bloodborne and many more.

I do love Tv shows and movies mainly Gothic Horror, Military, currently loved It: Welcome to Derry! I have so many it's hard to put everything. 

And many more intersts like photography, history (medieval and renaissance, antiquity), music (I don't play anything just listening), books and I love coffee ☕ addicted haha.

I sincerely hope to find someone here after many failed attempts, I believe it can happen. I am looking for someone with good communication, who wants to voice call or video call often because texting doesn't get you anywhere from experience. I want real thing and commitment fully and make it real not just online thing so of course meeting in real is important, and also ready for relationship to build something meaningful.

I generally prefer someone who is between 25-37 ( don't mind age gap but not huge) ,i don't know what else, just hoping for good experience and something to change for good, would be happy to exchange pics during chat.

A couple of things that could help others and maybe a question.

LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK HERE:  For some reason, I thought I would feel closer to 100% right now but I guess that’s silly. I think we forget what a major surgery it is to have so many organs removed from our body. I feel pretty good overall. I still have a lot of digestive discomfort. Urinating is weird and I think it’s because of the Mini sling, I am used to leaking and that no longer happens!  I have random periods of pain. It seems to move around. Sometimes it’s the right side sometimes it’s the left side, I suspect it’s the internal stitches and sutures. I do get tired. If I have dinner with friends one night I pretty much spend most of the next day lying down. I don’t feel ready to drive because I’m still sore, but also because I do drive a big pick up truck. I’d love to know other people’s feelings at two weeks postop.

TIPS AND WHAT WORKED FOR ME: 

Overall, I’ve had an uneventful recovery with no complications other than a few setbacks. 

The setbacks typically occurred when I overdid it. My Surgeon’s office was so adamant about not lifting and really drilled that into my head, so I try not to push that limit even a little bit. Anything I’ve overdone was just being on my feet too long.

Up until day, 11 or 12 if I was on my feet too much I started to feel like my insides were falling out. It also took 10 or 11 days to get past the sense of having a dry tampon in there. Again, I have a mini sling so that’s on my urethra so I suspect that was contributing to my discomfort down there. Sitting was really uncomfortable . I’d rather be standing or lying down.

Protein shakes- I am hypoglycemic so I generally need a lot of protein. I noticed with my recovery how much more protein I needed. Every morning I drank a fair life chocolate protein drink right after my coffee. Midday I’d have a yogurt based protein drink. Some days I’d add another protein drink. Usually I make my own, but as far as recovery, this was easier. I definitely noticed a difference in my energy and how good I felt based on how much protein I was eating.

What helped me the most was a nurse Friend telling me to drink half a cup of prune juice mixed with half a cup of boiling water. Guzzle it and then do it again. Every time I did this within 30 minutes I had a bowel movement. 

I’ve developed a love of dates lol. I can sit here and snack on dates and they will remain part of my diet going forward. 

Prior to surgery I was afraid that my laparoscopic would become an incision due to scar tissue so I over purchased every item listed here as suggested. I don’t think that’s necessarily a good idea. 

I strongly suggest nightgowns. I am not a nightgown person. I now own four of them and for 10 days. It’s pretty much all I wore. I bought underwear a size larger and I cut the elastic and then I was able to fold them properly to where they didn’t rub against an incision. The first day that I wore pajama bottoms for a little while, I rubbed the glue off the primary incision and caused it to bleed . Again back to the nightgowns.

I did not take narcotics. I did combine Advil and Tylenol and still occasionally take a dose during the day if I’m too uncomfortable. 

I feel like the most lingering discomfort is my bowels working. I swear I feel every step of it. I’ll eat in a half an hour later. I’m really uncomfortable until I have a movement. And I still have gas in that way. 

I’d also strongly suggest Gas-X like others say and I found great relief with lemon ginger tea. It just really helped settle my stomach when it was upset and it seemed to help me pass food through my digestive tract. Whenever I was uncomfortable or in pain, I would walk around and then drink a cup of tea and it would usually subside. 

I think I should add that I’m 58 years old. I’m seven years post menopause and I’m on HRT. So luckily, I have none of the hormonal shifts that many of you have. But I also think my age slows my recovery a little bit. It didn’t help that I was coming off of six months of depression over losing my beloved dog and caring for my  mom (who lives with me) and so much stress. I really think the stronger you are going into it the easier your recovery will be.

I hope this helps others prepare, I was terrified going in like many of you. But I also keep comparing myself to others who were walking 3 miles on day five of their recovery and have to realize that other factors come in to play. One of my issues is I don’t sleep well. Under any circumstances. You need to sleep to heal and if you’re not sleeping, you’re slowing down you’re healing. ",2,1767014995.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

We have a Breville Barista Pro that we've been happy with for espresso for more than 5 years -- so we were gravitating towards the Precision Brewer (and maybe the Luxe, for ease of refilling). Then, the internet did its thing and turned up the Moccamaster, which is now on our radar.

We go through 4-5 cups over a four-hour work morning, so I'm thinking a thermal carafe, rather than a glass/hotplate version, is right for us(?)

I’m 24, Bangalore-based, software engineer (yes yes, *another one*). I don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t club. Basically my red flags are very boring. My idea of a wild night is filter coffee after 7pm and still sleeping on time.

Tried dating apps. Results:

* Matches: yes
* Conversations: also yes
* Replies after 2 days: *404 not found*

At this point even Swiggy delivers faster than dating apps.

I’m vegetarian, calm, slightly introverted, and overthink simple things like “should I reply now or wait 3 minutes so I don’t look desperate”. I like quiet cafés, long walks, and conversations that don’t start and end with “wyd”. Friends say I’m a “green flag”, but apparently green flags are invisible on apps.

Not looking for drama, not looking for timepass. Just looking for one normal, emotionally available human who also feels dating in Bangalore is weirdly hard if you don’t live in a pub.

Girls of Reddit — honest question — where do people like *us* even meet?

been a big coffee lover since my childhood especially of cappucino never like black coffee as in my hometown when we were kids the most famous type of coffee was that nescafe sachets so when i tried black coffee for the first time with those sachets i literally puked and throwed away the whole mug

  
Until recently when a friend of mine gifted me davidoff rich aroma and when i tasted a cup of black coffee made out of it it just wasn't that bitter and rubbery taste like nescafe s\*\*t so i literally am about to finish that 100g jar in just 2 weeks and wanted to explore if any better brands/coffees like davidoff are there in market and yes in davidoff itself there is a huge variety to choose from so kindly help me out with the best brand to have  black coffee of considering above experience and yes i tried rage coffee and found out its good as a cappucino but okayish/not that good as a black coffee

So Mom (85) is in the hospital for the third time in six weeks. COPD flare-up, a bad one. She’d been getting increasingly delirious, then not really present, now non-responsive. I talked her onto accepting a BIPAP last night. It was her only chance of any recovery. I’ve been waking as they test her every hour, hoping her carbon dioxide goes down. I’m alternating between crying in despair and drowning in potential logistics. 

Carbon dioxide. It’s up, it’s down, it’s back up, it’s down more than when she started, we’ll test again in an hour. The twelve year old punching buttons at the doctor’s request tries to explain the machine and give optimistic advice. It’s not hitting much better than the pessimistic version.

The pessimistic goes like this: I have a hospice consult tomorrow/today. Mostly because the nurse manager pushed the “keep her comfortable” pretty hard, along with a bonus “she’s 85”. His ease in suggesting it felt flippant. I mean—DUH. I’m her caregiver. I’ve had a front row seat to her decline for the past eight years. So I told him & other team members, “Give me a consult with a Hospice Doctor. If they say she’s at that stage, then fine.” But I’m not going to do that casually.

I mind my manners as much as I can, because my mom is maybe-dying right in front of me. She has a Living Will, but was also begging to live. I’m trying to thread a needle honoring all her contradictory wishes and what’s in her best interest. There’s not much energy left to worry about anything else.

That was yesterday.

Today, in the asscrack of pre-dawn, they just told me the doctor wants a head CT, because she’s not coming out of it, even though her levels have improved. Now they’re asking if it’s metabolic. No one knows what’s going on and what potential outcomes are most likely. I voted for: “Give all the tests and get an answer.” Waiting for the test results with my second large coffee on a smattering of bad naps that passed for a night’s sleep on a hospital room sofa.

Her decline has been too steep and fast. As much as it terrifies me, I could see the “make her comfortable” becoming imminent. It feels like every outcome will break my heart. There is no win here.",7,1767013814.0,AgingParents,6,1.0,False

Was printing something for myself last night, for my coffee machine. Was a 4hr build and left it, came down this AM and it was a mess, with the fan part of the head hanging off. Cleaned it up and replaced the fan and all looked to be good, did a block test and all came out fine.

  
Only now I am noticing that on the initial warmup when it goes along the back side initially before doing the test strip along the front, it's scraping the Build Plate along the back as it moves along. Not just the kisses to test height but fully moving along the plate.

  
I also removed the plate and noticed there was a dent in the plate underneath the build plate in the back left corner. It looks like there is a dent also in the build plate that caused it.

  
Any suggestions? When it's doing the scraping along the back, it also builds some filament around the nozzle which seems to be then getting caught in any builds. It's only done this since I changed the filament to a new Basic PLA I bought off Amazon...",2,1767013765.0,FlashForge,0,1.0,False

So many of the tools in the self-hosted community are voluntarily maintained and developed by passionate developers, pouring countless hours of time into their projects to make our lives easier and more secure.

 

Behind every project is more than just a username, it’s a real person who is often facing a difficult time balance between family, work, or school. I know being a maintainer myself this struggle is hard. At times, the pile of issue/request tickets can be daunting, but seeing people genuinely enjoy my work and provide feedback makes it so fulfilling.

 

A common misconception is that you need money to give back. One of the best things about self-hosting and open source is that support comes in many ways, and most of them cost nothing. Here are some ways you can give back going into the new year:

* Financial **support**, if you can: GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, Patreon (often linked in repos or maintainer profiles).
* **Send a message** to a maintainer describing how you use their software in your daily life. Trust me, we love hearing this‼
* **Contribute** code to a project written in a language you’re comfortable with.
* **Improve** documentation or translations in your native language (many projects use platforms like Weblate).
* **Spread the word**: write blog posts, record videos, or share your favorite self-hosted tools with others.

Even small gestures can have a massive impact on a maintainer’s motivation. A kind message, a small pull request, or simply telling someone their work mattered can be the difference between burnout and renewed energy.

 

Thank you all for contributing, supporting, and helping make this community thrive over the past year. Here’s to an even brighter, collaborative, and inspiring 2026 together!

For example, I'm a woman, 40s with a severely abusive and neglectful mother. She was mentally unwell and we were allowed very little contact with adults or figures of authority outside of her.  She was volatile, untrustworthy, and I just never felt safe or like i could let my guard down with her. My method was always to grey rock and survive. And that sentiment slowly just attached to me. 

I dont bring up male friendships because although I also struggle with those, they often have the Sexuality attraction element that is so hard to read sometimes. And it's a common experience for many women to think they have a close male friends and then find out he was always just secretly holding a candle for her. 

I think that's what further makes me idealized and desire what female based friendships look like on TV. Is this realistic?? Possible?? Warm, strong, validating, enriching, motivating. I had female friendships but was always lost in how to act in them and (hindsight is 20/20) I realize that they sensed it? 

My idea of friendships seems to be very youthful and outdated. I notice that I approach them in a similar way to dating.  Let's get together, have coffee and chat, if we get along we meet over and over doing different activities until one or both day how much we enjoy hanging out. Discuss our kids from a place of understanding.  We can go shopping, see a movie..

I realize that from the outside looking in, adult neurotypical friendships that i have seen be successful are not really like that. People seem to meet in different contexts(work/school) and although they may have several surface level acquaintances people seem content and don't need more.  They seem happy just knowing a few soccer moms to arrange play dates with. Or a coworker to have an occasional brunch just gets their social needs meet.. why do I so badly want this tv image of a female bestie?

I really do feel like I'm the issue here i just need it pointed out for me where I'm going wrong.

\-> Was able to watch Beautiful Sunrise with my partner early morning.

\-> Owner Free 😉

\-> Near to local coffee shops and best Old Mussoorie Road Café. 

\-> Safe parking for my car.

\-> Clean and Hygienic

Cons :-

\-> The getaway didn’t had any such major cons, just that wifi servers were down (a major thing for me), so the speed dropped and I wasn’t able to Videocall my family to show views without blurring the video.

1pylhhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pylhhe/the_blue_door/,The Blue Door,"I found this letter locked in an antique desk. I hope you all can make more sense of it than I can:

“I love my late husband. He was the light of my life. He was as stoic, and reliable as men come. He was kind, considerate, generous, and brave. He touched not just my life, but the lives of so many more. He was a good man. However, what he bequeathed me after his departure has cost me many nights of sleep. My dreams are plagued by that blue door, that door to the deepest depths. I love my late husband, but I also hate him for what he, and his family have burdened me with.

I feel a great guilt for my conflicted feelings. He has been my lifelong companion since my parents were killed for the simple crime of freeing poor souls from the chains of slavery. They were shot by gunslingers whilst smuggling a black family into union states. Their deaths were quickly avenged by the couple who would become my adoptive parents. They were a French family. Their son was named Louis. We had been engaged since the day of our birth.

Louis, and I spent almost every day together after my parent’s deaths. He was a well read boy, and would tell me fantastical stories of knights, dragons, and ghosts. He was quite imaginative too, and was a fantastic writer. He had many works published in various publications. We spent many a day wandering his parent’s Maine property, just exploring. I have fond memories of us picking apples, and sharing kisses as the autumnal leaves fell around our ears.

Louis’s parents often spent months away from the mansion, doing their great work. Whenever they were home, Louis’s mother would train me with a sword. She was quite adept with a blade. She always said the days of the fair maiden were coming to an end, and soon women everywhere would need to pick up arms to protect their homes, same as the men. As she taught me to fight, Louis’s father taught me to look into the stars. He showed me many planets within God’s sky. He told me about how sailors would use them to guide themselves home, and how many cultures would worship them.

One summer day, when I was 19, I remember Louis being led into the woods by his father. I was training blades with his mother. We had forsaken modesty to prevent heatstroke, and to protect the integrity of our clothes. Whilst a hot-blooded young man would have grown red at the sight of seeing their future wife in bloomers, I saw he was so pale, and distraught that his natural instincts were forgotten. When I saw him being led away from those woods, I thought I had seen a specter from one of Louis’s horror stories.

I think part of Louis died that day. He was never quite the same after that. His eyes were always somewhat hollow, and his nights were as sleepless as mine are now. He refused to speak of what he saw that day. However, he promised he would show me that day. God forgive me, it was a vow I wished he had died before he had the ability to fulfill.

We wed on my 20th birthday. The ceremony, and subsequent afterparty were dignified enough. However, it was beyond boring. The gossip that the guests regurgitated was so pedantic that I felt I would die of the sheer stupidity of it all. I know the upper classes are obligated to placate ignorant guests such as these, but it is dull work. With God’s good grace, Louis whisked me away to a quiet corner of the wood with a smuggled bottle of wine, and some cake.

Six months after we were wed, Louis’s parents were killed in their marriage bed by a hired gun. Louis was devastated. All I could provide for him was my companionship. He had been my rock, so I tried my best to be his. He cried into my bosom, praying that God’s wrath would be brought down on those that robbed him of his loving parents. I hate to admit it, but I had lived with his parents for so long that I had forgotten the faces of my own, only remembering them by their reputations. I grieved with Louis.

I tried to bear him a child to fill the void left in his heart, and mine. However, the doctors told me I could not perform that particular duty as a wife. I went through a short-lived depressive episode. It wasn’t that I necessarily wanted to be a mother, but rather I wanted to bring my husband joy. I felt like I had failed him. However, Louis told me not to worry about that. He wanted my passion. He wanted to see me succeed in my dreams. He wanted me to live for me.

I hired a fencing instructor from Germany. Whilst he tried to instruct me, it seemed like I had more to teach him than he did for me. His ego wouldn’t allow him to do so. I hired another instructor, this time from Louis’s home country, France. This also ended with another bruised ego. The more instructors I managed to humiliate, the more I began to wonder just what Louis's mother was preparing me for. She told me a day that women must bear arms, but surely that day wouldn’t come in my lifetime, right? My prowess spread through the dueling world, and soon I was being challenged by fencers from across the lands. I began being known as The Scarlet Sting after the fiery waves of my orange hair, and the speed of my blade.

My accomplishments reached the papers, and made me the talk of the party. I would often be asked to perform tricks for my guests. Part of me was happy for the acknowledgement of my skill. However, I heard from behind paper fans about how unladylike I was, and how I played with swords atone for the fact that my womb was as bare as the Sahara. Even my fellow fencers wouldn’t take me seriously. Despite these fools, I never felt more alive than when I was behind the hilt of a rapier. I began to collect swords from all over the world, reveling in how peculiar the ignorant would find me. A man of my husband’s status would have a trophy room full of animal heads. However, he reserved that room for my collection.

Years into our happy marriage, civil war began to brew. Louis joined the army, to follow in the footsteps of not only his parents, but mine. The penultimate night before he departed for the front lines, he took my hand, and led me towards the treeline. He, and I wore our swords on our waist. He insisted.

“I promised you that I would show you what my father showed me all those years ago,” Louis spoke to me in a solemn tone as we walked, stepping over overgrown roots as we did, guided only by the lantern he carried. I could see a primal fear in his eyes. They were like the eyes of a cat upon hearing the growl of a dog.

“My love, we do not need to do this now,” I tried to comfort him, squeezing his hand tightly.

“I leave for the border the day after tomorrow, Should I die, I want you to know the secret my father kept when my family first moved to this country,” Louis rubbed my arm. We moved further into the woods than we ever dared to do so as children.

“You will not die, God will not allow a man such as yourself to do so. Yours is a noble, and just cause,” I tried to reassure him.

“Both of our parents had the same dream,” Louis dug his nails into the flesh of my palm. He was nervous as a hare, “please, just see what I must show you.”

I recalled how pale my love was when he returned from those woods all those years ago. I didn’t know what to expect, but I knew it would be nothing good. I couldn’t fathom what could possibly be beyond these trees. The branches seemed to reach down as if to halt our progress through the woods. Perchance, were they warning us of what was to come?

We soon reached a clearing. Dim moonlight shone down on what I thought was a smooth boulder, half buried in the grass. We drew closer, and I could feel a creeping dread permeating through my very soul. Just looking upon this seemingly innocuous thing felt like it would taint my spirit. Louis, and I circled around the boulder, and soon came upon a metal door, painted blue. It was of such alien, and peculiar construction that I know not how to begin describing it.

“What is this thing?” I asked.

I received no answer for what felt like a half-hour. When I gazed upon my husband, it looked like he was searching for words that refused to come to him. Even a squeeze from my hand would not rouse him. He did speak eventually though.

“This accursed thing is the death of our world,” he finally answered, “and it is my duty to make sure it never opens. When my father brought me here, we were greeted by the roar of a thousand screaming beasts. They clawed, and gnawed at the door, ready for our flesh. However, they were unable to escape. We watch this door to make sure nothing escapes. We are the protectors of God’s holy creation.”

My eyes would not leave that blue, metal rectangle. My mind wandered as I began to imagine what horrors lie beyond this door. My love’s father protected this place, and Louis would too with the Lord’s blessing. My husband clutched onto me, so I held him close. He was clearly terrified. He was about to run into battle with a rifle in hand, and this door was what scared him. My own fear began to take hold. I obviously wished he would return to be with me again. However, my cowardice also wished he would return so that I would not be left alone with this damned thing.

That night was spent in silence. The next was spent in our marriage bed, our room echoing with the sounds of our love. We held each other in a loving embrace, our sweet kisses comforting the other that everything would be alright. It was the last night I saw him. Louis fought for six long weeks before a stray cannonball made me into a widow.

I wore black much longer than most. My grief was beyond what could be comprehended by those who pretended to be my friends. The false sympathy I was given enraged me to such an extent, that I became a recluse for the safety of those who would otherwise offer me what they would consider comfort. A part of me died the day Louis was taken from me. First my parents, then my adoptive parents, and now my husband were all taken from me. I was alone. Even in a house full of servants, I was alone.

Days after Louis’s death, I was given a strange looking key by his Last Will and Testament. It didn't look like any key that belonged to our mansion. It was thinner, and more jagged. I let it gather dust in my jewelry box for almost a decade while I mourned. I cared not for what lay beyond that damned door. It mattered not. Nothing mattered when compared to the darkness of the ever growing void in my heart.

I wasn’t the same. I grew to drink. My skill with a blade grew rusty. I lost the use of my off-hand in a duel. I had to wear a sling so it would not get in my way. I fell from grace. I didn’t care. To hell with those ignorant fools. I cared not for what they thought. Even those who claimed to know my pain weren’t spared my disdain, for they did not love their husbands like I had loved mine.

Doctors tried to diagnose me with mental illness. They might have tried to pull me from my station if not for my collection of swords that I kept nice, and sharp. I didn’t need to verbally threaten them, the steely glint of malice in my eye was more than sufficient. The fear in their eyes made me smirk. It was one of the few joys I had left in my life.

I might have forgotten about the door, if I hadn’t thrown a bottle at my own reflection. The crash knocked my jewelry box off the bureau, and awoke the butler. As he cleaned the debris, I noticed that key. On that fateful night, I no longer saw it as a key to ruin. I saw it was a key to an end to this nightmare.

Emboldened by drink, I strapped a sword to my hip, and stormed off through the woods. My head swam as I took that familiar path. The trees again seemed to be trying to keep me from my destination. I ignored them. I pushed the branches out of my way, and cut down any that were persistent. I soon reached that spot. It seemed to be welcoming me like an old friend. I cared not if God damned me for my actions. If he saw fit to take my husband away from me, then he didn’t deserve to have my soul too.

I circled around the stone. The cool, damp grass felt good on the soles of my feet. I faced that door, hand on the pommel of my sword. I didn’t really intend to fight whatever was in there. I simply wished for it to take me. Me bringing the sword with me was merely an act of routine. I had the key in hand. My heart raced as I moved closer to my fate. The blue painted door was cold to the touch.

The key growled like a hungry beast as I pushed it in. Although the sound should have scared me, it was weirdly comforting. May the jaws of Hell swallow me whole. I opened the door, and was greeted by a dim blue glow. I recalled how Louis described the roar of a thousand screaming beasts. Yet I stood there unobstructed. I stepped through the door.

The room I found myself in was much larger than the boulder would have otherwise accommodated. I moved further into the darkness. About a dozen glowing windows illuminated the room. They seemed so strange. Attached to them were buttons, each of which had a letter of the alphabet. I went up to one of the windows, wondering what magic could empower it like this. I pressed a button with a “B” on it. On the window, a “B” appeared as if commanded by my action. I pressed the letters of my name, and my name appeared on the window.

A moan broke the silence from deep within the darkness. On the opposite side of the room, I could see a shadow on the wall. It took a bit of focus for me to recognize it was the entrance of a hallway. The noise sent a shiver along my skin. I cursed myself for not bringing a lantern. Still, I came here for a purpose. I took a deep breath, and moved towards the hall.

My nose was greeted by the smell of burnt coffee. As I blindly stumbled through down the hall, my hand guiding my path towards oblivion, the smell grew increasingly stronger. I saw a strong white light shining from beneath a door. I watched it, waiting for it to move. Perhaps it was that same strange magic I had seen in the room behind me. I turned the handle of the door, expecting the light to shift at any second. It never did. I opened the door.

The source of the light was a strange looking metal bar. I picked it up, shining the light around like a torch. What a peculiar little device. Although the end was quite hot, it didn’t burn like a fire. The furniture of this room was minimally decorated. They were nothing but efficient shapes, no artistry, no flair. It was as if all humanity was drained from this place. The source of the coffee smell was a strange looking device made of glass, and some unknown material. Nothing was left of the coffee but a dried scum on the bottom of the glass bowl.

A swift movement in my peripheral vision pulled me from my explorations, and sent a jolt through my system. I found the light in my hand was shaking madly. I had to focus to steady my hand. I shone the light down both ways of the hall. I saw multiple doors down this path. Quickly steadying myself for what was to come, I began to trudge down the way, moving further into this accursed place. The darkness swallowed me. I found myself in a stone stairway with a metal railing. I couldn’t identify the kind of stone this was. I had never seen something like this before.

I moved towards the stairs, and began to descend. The stairs seemed to spiral down into the eternal shadow, possibly into Hell itself. I pondered on who could have made a home like this. Perhaps it had been constructed by the prince of the abyss, Lucifer. It didn’t seem like any kind of depiction of Hell that had been preached to me by the local priest. However, he had never been here, so how would he know what Hell really looked like? Perhaps Hell changed with the march of time, same as our world did since the death of Jesus.

I knew this place was dangerous. I knew it was evil. I knew it was death. After all, I had come in here for it to be my tomb. However, I had never seen a corpse before this day, even with the life I had lived. I drew closer. The neck had been slashed. The woman wore a long white coat. It was perhaps the most modest thing that she wore. Her skirt was short, and her shirt was thin. It was clear there were no further layers beneath. Long orange hair cascaded down her shoulder. Her face looked disturbingly familiar. I had seen this face earlier tonight. I had seen it in my own mirror. This was my face. This woman was me.

I nearly dropped my light as the realization overtook me. I stared at my own dead body, struggling to comprehend what I was seeing. However, I didn’t have long to contemplate my situation. I heard a noise above me. It was footsteps. I couldn’t afford to be seen. My damned light. It was my salvation, but also my doom. I didn’t know what was coming, but I knew it would see me. However, I needed to be able to see.

I searched the shadow with the light quickly, as the footsteps drew closer. I saw a door on a landing. I put the light on the ground, facing the landing. I rushed down the stairs, and yanked open the door. I closed it behind me. The door had a small, rectangular window. It had wire running through it in a diamond pattern. I peeked out. I could see my light from here. A moment later, the footsteps reached the landing where the light, and my corpse were.

I could hear a heavy breathing coming from that direction. It sounded labored. The one responsible seemed in pain, and made little whining moans. It mumbled to itself. I had trouble discerning the gender of this thing, if a monster could have one to begin with. I heard the creature slobbering. My stomach churned as I heard the sickening crunch of the creature sinking its fangs into my corpse’s flesh. This damned thing was eating the other me.

As the dread overtook me, I gripped the handle of my sword. The wound in my corpse’s throat wasn’t made by some monster. It was made with a blade. Someone else was here. Someone who, no doubt, meant me harm. I stepped away from the door, trying to distance myself from that disgusting noise. However, no matter how far I walked, the noise always seemed like it was right in front of me. I had to hold back the contents of my stomach.

I nearly fell as my foot met a step. I turned. Down yet more steps, I could see a dim green glow. I thought back to the windows upstairs. Perhaps I would find more magic down here. I looked back to the door I had entered here from. Perhaps I would be safer away from the moist, crunching noise. I began to descend again. The glow grew closer. I soon stepped into a new room.

The place I had found myself was a long room, both walls lined with huge jars, filled with glowing liquid. Anywhere that the glow didn’t touch was shrouded in darkness. In the jar closest to me was the preserved remains of an unborn babe, no doubt cut from its mother’s belly. I instinctively drew my blade. I had almost forgotten I had brought it with me in this disgusting place. My eyes wandered to the other jars.

In another jar was a teenage girl. An arm protruded from her mouth, and seemed to be strangling her. Her belly had teeth. Her fingers were stubs. I thought at first the stubs were a birth defect, but no. They had been bitten off. Her hair was orange.

Another jar had an old woman with two heads. Her eyes were replaced by tongues. Her wide open mouth didn’t seem to have one, or teeth, or gums. Her mouth seemed like a bottomless hole. She had no arms, or legs. Instead, her skin was dotted with little suction cups, like those of an octopus.

The last one I could stomach to look at was a woman just a bit younger than I was. She had four arms growing out of her back. The arms she was supposed to have seemed to have been fused to her chest as if her body was a straight jacket. Her legs bent backwards. Her nose, and lips were nonexistent. Again, her hair was orange.

All of these twisted monstrosities were me. Every single one of these was a perversion of not only nature, but of my own form. This was Hell. So this was why Louis heard screaming monsters, and I didn’t. This wasn’t just Hell. This was my Hell. Would I become one of these twisted mockeries of lifes? No, I wouldn’t allow myself to be taken. This place wouldn’t be my fate. I had to get out of here.

The door above me opened. There wasn’t another door out of here. I was trapped. I slipped into the darkness quickly, as I heard shuffling creeping downwards, and towards my location. The noise grew louder, and louder. I could hear mumbling, and pained moaning. The beast sounded large, almost as big as a bear. I had long since sobered up. I kept myself curled up, sword in hand, and ready to strike.

The sight that invaded my vision left a stain on my soul. I nearly . The creature was hunched over, its hands dragging along the floor. I could see two of my face on its shoulder blades, chewing on the orange hair. The main face was mostly covered, but I could see blood dripping from its oversized teeth. I trembled. I didn’t know if I could take this monster in a duel, especially with only one hand. No, I had to be stealthy.

The monster trudged further into the room, sniffing the air. I knew it would be able to smell my fear. I paused near me. I held my breath, my hand covering my nose, and mouth. It turned in my direction. Its eyes were blank. It had to be blind. It sniffed. Its breath smelled of rotten flesh. I could see maggots in the creature’s gums from the dim glow. It moved its head closer, mouth opening. It caught my scent.

My blade launched forward, slicing open one of the monster’s eyes. Three mouths screamed. Now I know what Louis had heard all these years ago. It threw its head back, clutching its eye. Taking the opportunity, I slashed at the monster’s throat, then retreated into the darkness again. I slipped along the shadow, as the monster brought a hand down, and shattered one of the jars. The fluid splashed everywhere. Luckily, I had backed away from jar enough to not get the worst of it.

I used my sword to tap one of the jars further into the room, trying to lure the monster away from the staircase. The monster lunged at me, blood gushing from its wounds. Despite bleeding profusely, the freak still had immense energy, and strength. I dove out of the way as it crashed into the jar I had tapped on. I rushed towards the stairs, ignoring as broken glass stabbed into my bare feet. I tore my way upwards, ignoring the beast behind me.

I rushed down the hall. I could see my light from the doorway. The monster was ascending behind me. The glass dug deeper into my feet. I cursed my stupidity, but kept running regardless. The creature was getting closer. I could practically feel its rotten breath on the back of my neck. The hall shook as it bounded in my direction. I could hear the screaming of the mouths on its back. I burst through the door, and dove to the left.

The monster didn’t have time to correct its course. It careened over the railing, falling into the abyss. The screaming grew more, and more distant. I heard bone crunching as it smacked into the railing. The noises very quickly descended into nothingness. I was enveloped in silence once again

I limped up the stairs from one landing to the next, and picked up my light. I tucked it in the armpit of my useless arm so I could hold onto the sword. I didn’t want to think about what had happened to my corpse. I didn’t shine my light on it. I didn’t want to know. I just had to get out of here. I moved up the stairs, leaving bloody footprints behind me. God forgive me for my stupidity. I just hoped He would show me mercy, and allow me to leave this place.

I found myself in the room with the windows again. I trudged forward. Sunlight shone through the door. I looked at the sun, breathing heavily. I pushed my way through. I found myself on God’s green Earth once more. Desperately, I slammed the door behind me, and locked it as fast as I could.

The doctor examined my wounds. He was more worried about my mental state. However, I think he knew better than to try something, even in my injured state. He helped me recover. I walked with a limp from that day forward. I mourned Abraham Lincoln’s death, along with the rest of the country. I eventually stopped wearing black, and accepted guests into my home once more. I was more discerning with who I accepted as guests.

I took on students, and trained them in the art of the sword. I spoke of a day where everyone, regardless of gender, would need to pick up arms to defend their homes. It was the same thing that Louis’s mom would tell me. I still miss Louis. Even though I remarried, he will still be my one true love.

As time marched forward, new inventions came to light. The typewriter reminded me of those glowing blue windows I saw, and later the electric lightbulb reminded me of the tube that lit my way in that Hellhole. The world would one day begin to look like that hole. Perhaps it was my fault. Perhaps I let something out when I went in there, and now its corruption was spreading throughout the land. I try not to think about that, but I find it difficult to do. Every now and then, I can see something speed through my peripheral vision. 

Even now as I write this, I can hear a heavy breathing outside of my bedroom door whilst my new husband is away on business. I have my sword, and a pistol with me. God, I’m sorry for what I have done. Please, show me mercy.”

So, anyway, today I just gave in and fully got up at 4am, made some coffee, and watched *Tenebrae* for the first time.

I cannot believe how good that film is. I can't stop thinking about it, and I want to rewatch it asap, as well as more Argento. I'd seen *Suspiria* and *Inferno*, which I absolutely love, but I was expecting *Tenebrae* to have a similar supernatural vein. The fact it didn't just made me enjoy it all the more.

I'm 47 and decades-long fan of Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava (i.e. Italian gothic/schlothic aesthetic, obviously) but *Tenebrae* has awoken a thirst for more Giallo in me, for sure. It's almost an embarrassment to only now be giving it the attention it deserves.

1pyldze,https://i.redd.it/jyh5u50q15ag1.jpeg,Building an astrology website without predictions (daily & personalized horoscopes),"I've been quietly building a small astrology website over the past few months, and I'm at a point where I'm not fully sure whether my core assumption is right - so I wanted to share the thinking here.

Most astrology products lean heavily into **predictions**: what will happen, what to avoid, what's coming next.  

I intentionally went in a different direction.

Instead of predicting outcomes, I'm experimenting with **interpretive, reflective readings** \- focused on emotional patterns, attention, and self-awareness for the day/week/month.

Right now the site includes:

\- Daily / Weekly / Monthly horoscope content (no login required)

\- Personalized readings based on birth data (login required, still free)

\- A 2026 year overview that's more about themes than forecasts

Everything is free at the moment. I added a small ""buy me a coffee"" link mostly to test intent, not revenue.

What I'm uncertain about:

\- Whether **non-predictive** astrology is actually something people want, or if it's too vague

\- Whether requiring login for personalization is reasonable, or just friction

\- How much explanation is too much for users who didn't come for astrology theory

I'm not trying to scale this aggressively. This is more of a content + system experiment, and I'm still deciding what direction to take next.

If you've built:

\- content-driven products

\- tools that sit somewhere between utility and interpretation

\- or things that deliberately don't give ""answers""

I'd genuinely appreciate any thoughts - especially critical ones.

Usually we drink milk based coffee every morning, I prefer hand electric powerfull milk foamer than steamer. 

I was thinking something about separate higher class grinder something like Eureka, and better coffee machine with 58mm portafilter or similar, not expensive, and compact if possible.  
But now I found interesting variants like Sage Barista Express or Ninja Luxe ES501EU or Delonghi La Specialista with built grinders. They look very nice and quite compact, but not sure about brewing block/heater and grinder.

LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) updated [critical minerals, opens new tab](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals) list now encompasses 60 different materials, representing around 80% of all the mined commodities on the periodic table.

Some are well-known industrial inputs such as copper, [nickel and zinc](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/united-states-adds-nickel-zinc-critical-minerals-list-andy-home-2021-11-15/). Many are not. Among the rare earth elements are exotic metals such as gadolinium, ytterbium and praseodymium.

From aluminium through to zirconium, all are considered ""essential for national security, economic stability and supply chain resilience,"" according to the USGS.

The spectrum of metals now deemed ""vital for a modern American economy"" speaks to a quiet revolution in how metals are used, one nurtured more in the laboratory than in the blast furnace.

# SPICE METALS

Many critical minerals are ""spice metals"" - used in only tiny quantities but with a transformative impact.

Consider, for example, the humble semiconductor chip, the foundation stone of modern technology, ubiquitous but unseen in our laptops, mobile phones and cars.

Silicon has been the wafer material of choice for decades but is close to its technical limits when it comes to advanced computing. Sprinkle in a dash of gallium and germanium, however, and the chip's capacity rises exponentially.

As garnish for the finished product, you'll need a mix of palladium, arsenic, iridium, titanium, copper and cobalt for plating, wiring, doping and packaging.

It's a lot of metal for something so small, but the spice is worth it as the semiconductor industry seeks ever more powerful chips.

The spice is also highly prized by the U.S. military, which helped develop the technology at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Super‑powerful gallium nitride chips enhance radar capability and boost drone-jamming capacity, a major defence priority in an age of drone swarms.

# POWER METALS

The accelerator behind much of the recent metals revolution has been the global drive to reduce carbon emissions.

The road to phasing out fossil fuels is paved with metals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese.

Lithium was a niche industrial mineral used mainly in industrial lubricants until a little-known start-up called Tesla [(TSLA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) unveiled [the Roadster, opens new tab](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/03/how-tesla-got-the-jump-on-the-rest-of-the-auto-industry-way-back-in-2006/) electric vehicle in 2006.

Now lithium sits at the heart of the shift from internal combustion engines to cleaner technology.

No welding required.

Lithium and other metallic cathode ingredients are blended as powders into bespoke recipes for battery makers. It's more chemistry than metalwork.

A battery alone won't make a vehicle move. For that you need an electric motor, and the best are permanent-magnet motors rich in rare earths.

Smaller magnet motors are needed to operate the windscreen wipers, adjust the seats and lower the windows.

Like semiconductors, rare earth magnets are everywhere, just not in plain sight.

# PHOENIX METALS

Copper wires the modern technological age and tin glues the whole thing together.

These are two of the oldest metals used by humans; in combination they defined the Bronze Age.

Thirty or so years ago both were in danger of becoming sunset metals as core applications in telecoms and packaging were steadily replaced by fiber optics and plastics respectively.

Tin is still used for brass decorations and long-life food cans, but together these now account for only 17% of global usage, according to the International Tin Association.

More than half of all the tin used today is for soldering circuit boards together, making it an indispensable part of the bridge between physical and virtual worlds.

As for copper, it's still the best electrical conductor at the price. It wires every EV, it wires every charging point and it wires every power source.

Millennia after bronze transformed tool-making, these two ""phoenix metals"" have been reborn as core inputs for modern life.

# METALS AGE

Metals, both old and new, have been seeping into our technology in weird, wonderful and mostly unnoticed ways.

Without them, nothing works.

A study by U.S. defence software company Govini found that more than 80,000 parts across 1,900 U.S. weapon systems incorporate antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten or tellurium. That's nearly 78% of all U.S. weapons and just five out of 60 critical minerals.

This is a major problem for the Pentagon, since China is the dominant global producer of just about all of them and has this year shown it is quite prepared to leverage that position in the form of [export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-chinas-new-rare-earth-export-controls-work-2025-10-10/).

It's also a big problem for everyone, since civilian life depends on the same spicy metallic mixes.

The West's pressing need to escape China's chokehold on critical minerals supply has thrust these previously obscure elements to the center of world politics.

U.S. President Donald Trump's deal with Ukraine in May [was underwritten](https://www.reuters.com/world/kyiv-is-ready-sign-resources-deal-with-us-ukraine-government-source-says-2025-04-30/) by the country's mineral resources.

The Washington-brokered peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda [opens the door](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congos-gecamines-partners-with-mercuria-market-critical-minerals-2025-12-05/) to a part of the world rich in copper and cobalt, currently dominated by Chinese operators.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation is [weighing up](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congos-gecamines-partners-with-mercuria-market-critical-minerals-2025-12-05/) an investment with Congo's state miner Gecamines, which would give the U.S. a right of first refusal on future supply.

**Critical minerals are going to stay in the news until further notice. So expect more headlines about metals you've never heard of, such as indium, Niobium and Scandium.**

**They're all critical in one form or another in the 21st century.**

# Dec. 29th, 2025~ How the Trump administration sought to rebuild the critical mineral supply chain

[How the Trump administration sought to rebuild the critical mineral supply chain](https://preview.redd.it/l16nyzzkx4ag1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e469153eed2217dd4d65c096cf7a32118f51425)

The [Trump administration](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/trump-administration/) has been racing to expand the United States's supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths through a government-wide effort to reduce reliance on [China](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/china/).

China controls about 90% of the global supply chain of critical minerals and rare earths. Specifically, it controls the processing and refining of minerals, so even if a mineral is [mined](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/mining/) in the U.S., it will likely need to be sent to China for processing.

In recent months, China has tightened its grip on the supply chain, raising national security concerns, as both critical minerals and rare earths are used in a range of defense applications, including fighter jets, missiles, and night vision. Critical minerals and rare earths are also used in the energy sector for wind turbines and batteries. Even everyday items, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and blenders, need minerals.

​Against this backdrop, the Trump administration began pursuing a series of policy changes to expand the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals, including taking direct stakes in mineral companies, streamlining federal permitting, and entering into [trade agreements](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/trade/) with foreign countries. 

The administration’s most unusual strategies involved taking direct ownership in mineral companies, including taking a 5% stake in Lithium Americas, a Canadian company developing a lithium mine and processing plant in Nevada. The administration has also taken a [15% direct stake](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3469212/unusual-dod-deal-stake-rare-earth-supplier-key-china-competition/) in MP Materials to build a rare-earth magnet supply chain by constructing the company’s second U.S. magnet facility.

The government has also taken stakes in mineral companies such as ReElement Technologies, Vulcan Elements, and Trilogy Metals.

The Trump administration’s approach has departed from how traditional federal support for mining projects has been structured. 

Kevin Brunelli, a nonresident fellow at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy, and Tom Moerenhout, a professor at [Columbia University’s](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/columbia-university/) School of International and Public Affairs, wrote in October that the government has typically backed mining projects [through grants or loans](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/qa-how-the-us-is-using-equity-stakes-to-support-domestic-critical-minerals-development/), but the Trump administration has taken a new route by getting directly involved with the company.

“Some in the Trump administration have suggested that the government should be able to profit from the upside risk of projects with an ownership stake,” they wrote, adding that “Another potential reason for government equity investments is to have a lever to force the production of certain critical minerals even when they are not profitable but considered essential from a national security standpoint. At the same time, there is equity risk that if the project does not succeed the government will lose its initial capital injection.”

Last month, executives from critical mineral companies [testified before House lawmakers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3892097/critical-mineral-ceo-defend-federal-ownership-counter-china/) to defend the administration’s approach of taking stakes in the companies, stating it was necessary to compete with China.

MP Materials Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Matthew Sloustcher said, “Free-market capitalism is the engine of our economy ... but the reality is that we are not operating in a free market.”

He added, “China is both a monopoly and non-market economy.”

Still, the strategy has drawn criticism from some, raising concerns about the government's approach to taking stakes in private companies and warning it could harm free-market capitalism. However, that pushback is not likely to slow down the administration, as it has hinted that it plans to take stakes in other critical minerals moving forward.

Earlier this month, at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event, White House National Energy Dominance Council Executive Director Jarrod Agen said that the administration will continue to make private-public partnerships.

“You’re going to see throughout this administration, historic deals when it comes to critical minerals, historic partnerships with the private sector, and then really a revitalization of mining in this country,” Agen said.

The administration has also sought to streamline permitting for critical mineral projects through the Permitting Council, a federal agency that guides essential infrastructure projects through the permitting process.

The council oversees the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act program, which supports the permitting process for infrastructure projects across sectors, including mining. The Trump administration has utilized the program to help mining projects obtain permits.

Emily Domenech, executive director of the Permitting Council, told the Washington Examiner in October that the council is focusing on sectors [they believe have been “forgotten.”](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3863714/permitting-council-mining-projects-moving/) She added, “I think the mining sector really is that forgotten sector that did not get attention from previous administrations, even when maybe it should have.”

In addition, President [Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/donald-trump/) signed an executive order in March to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost domestic mineral production capacity by providing financing, loans, and investment for new projects. The order will also establish a dedicated critical minerals fund. It also called on several federal agencies to prioritize mineral expansion, including the interior, energy, and defense departments.

However, those domestic efforts have unfolded alongside escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. As Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods, China has imposed strict export controls on its rare-earth elements.

China has used its dominance in the market against the U.S. by halting exports of Chinese minerals as part of trade negotiations. In October, China and the United States [reached a truce](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3869670/stocks-rare-earths-producers-boosted-trump-rise-china-truce/) over Beijing’s most recent export restrictions on an additional five rare earths. China agreed to suspend the restrictions for one year.

Still, the agreement does not address restrictions imposed by China in April, when it suspended exports of seven types of rare-earth metals and magnets and required companies to obtain a ministry-issued license for any exports.

The New York Times

Tomahawk missiles are coveted by militaries around the world because they can hit a target 1,000 miles away. That accuracy is possible because their fins use powerful magnets made of samarium — a rare-earth metal that can tolerate high heat.

When China put restrictions on some rare-earth exports this year, it cut off the supply of samarium to U.S. defense contractors that sell to Raytheon, the maker of Tomahawk missiles. Samarium is processed almost exclusively in China, where more than 85% of the world’s rare-earth magnets are made.

A carefully orchestrated deal involving two European companies gave U.S. defense contractors access to a new source of samarium, allowing production to continue for now. But that supply — made from material that had been sitting in a factory in France since the 1970s — is limited. Now the Trump administration is racing to develop a new source before the European stockpile runs out.

China began requiring export licenses for samarium and six other rare-earth metals in April after President Donald Trump rolled out tariffs against China and several other nations. A spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in an email that the export controls had been instituted to “defend world peace.” Foreign companies that use samarium for military purposes are no longer allowed to buy it.

“No defense contractor will be able to use the same path to buy samarium metal that we’ve used in the past,” said an executive for one of Raytheon’s suppliers, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. “You’re on the naughty list. You’re not getting that material.”

Most rare-earth magnets are made of neodymium, which is used in everyday applications such as cellphones, auto parts and electronics. But the defense industry requires samarium-cobalt magnets, which can withstand extreme heat.

The stakes for finding alternatives are enormous. Unless new sources of samarium or a substitute material can be found, American manufacturers won’t be able to build fighter jets or precision-guided missiles. They may be forced to sacrifice precision if they can’t get the right magnets, said Aisha Haynes, a former Defense Department official responsible for supply chain issues.

New systems in development — such as hypersonic missiles — also depend on securing non-Chinese sources of samarium.

“You never want to give any one nation that much power,” said Haynes, who retired in April. “They can turn that source on and off whenever they want.”

The situation would be more dire if not for the foresight of people experienced in magnet making. Arnold Magnetic Technologies, a Rochester, New York-based manufacturer of samarium-cobalt magnets with factories in Switzerland, Thailand and China, had more than a year’s supply of the metal on hand when China announced its export controls on April 4, said Aaron Williams, the company’s chief commercial officer.

As the summer wore on, Arnold’s customers began to worry about what would happen when that inventory ran out. Arnold turned to Grant Smith, the chair of Less Common Metals near Liverpool, England, one of the last remaining manufacturers of rare-earth metals in the Western world.

Smith had already spent years hunting for alternatives to Chinese samarium. He found one: a decades-old cache of samarium nitrate in a factory in France. The material was owned by Solvay, a Belgian chemical company with a factory in France that was once one of the world’s largest producers of rare-earth oxides.

Turning rock into magnets requires separating the 17 rare-earth elements from one another using massive vats of solvents, a process Solvay helped pioneer. Solvay had stopped separating rare-earth elements in France two decades ago, according to a spokesperson, who said it had become “uneconomical.” Samarium processed outside China is five to eight times as expensive, Williams said.

But Solvay kept its stock of semifinished materials and still had the know-how and equipment to refine it into a form that Smith could use. And Less Common Metals happened to have an old furnace that could handle the job.

Smith lined up customers, including Arnold and Permag, which owns Electron Energy Corp., another American manufacturer of samarium-cobalt magnets that has supplied the U.S. defense industry for decades. That created a kind of buyers’ club, enabling Smith to offer Solvay an attractive price to refine the entire stash, roughly 200 tons.

Smith brought Solvay’s samarium to Britain, where his company is turning it into metal that will be melted into alloys. His customers will press the material into blocks that factories in the United States will cut into magnets. Those magnets can go into motor systems of devices called fin actuators, which adjust the trajectory of a missile by positioning the fins on its body.

Smith’s deal was just coming together when China announced its restrictions. Since then, his phone has not stopped ringing as desperate aerospace and defense companies search for samarium.

“When they rang up, I was able to put my hand on my heart and say: ‘You do not need to panic. We have you covered,’” said Smith, whose company previously struggled to make a profit. “From April 4, I’ve had two days off. I’m not joking. It’s been crazy.”

Smith estimated that Solvay’s stash would last his U.S. defense industry customers more than a year.

“The issue with rare earths is that it has to be economical to process — you need volume,” Williams of Arnold said. “Grant made a short-to-medium-term bridge, and it was extremely important.”

The problem isn’t new. U.S. officials have fretted about an overreliance on China for rare-earth metals for more than a decade. Although samarium-cobalt magnets were invented in an Air Force research lab in Ohio in the 1960s, the industry moved to China in the 1980s, partly because of rich rare-earth deposits there. Today, China mines, processes, sells and consumes such large volumes of rare-earth metals that it can drop the price below the cost of production when foreign competitors come online. American and European companies have struggled to stay afloat. Many either declared bankruptcy or opened factories in China.

In recent years, U.S. policymakers have tried to build a domestic supply. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 and 2024 gradually tightened restrictions on the use of rare-earth metals from China in weapons systems, and stipulated that all such materials must be China-free by Jan. 1, 2027.

But such mandates have been inconsistently enforced, partly because alternatives are not available. In 2023 and 2024, when magnets were supposed to be made of metal that was created outside China, Lockheed Martin notified the Pentagon that its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter had Chinese-made magnets. The military paused production of the jet for months but eventually issued a waiver allowing the parts.

Raytheon has acknowledged the risk of being cut off from vital components. “Emerging laws and increasing regulatory requirements aimed at global supply chains may impact our ability to access certain materials,” Raytheon’s parent company, RTX, wrote in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this year.

Raytheon did not respond to requests for comment for this article. David Copley, the White House coordinator for critical minerals, also did not respond to a request for comment.

The demand for samarium is relatively small. The U.S. defense industry requires less than 200 tons per year, according to estimates by Jack Lifton, co-chair of the Critical Minerals Institute, an organization that advises the industry.

Smith expressed confidence that other sources would be up and running before the Solvay stash ran out, but it is far from clear where the next batch will come from.  
The Trump administration has given MP Materials, the owner of a California rare-earth mine, a $150 million loan to expand its processing facility to handle samarium, as part of a larger, multibillion-dollar deal with the company. But that project could take years to come to fruition.

The Trump administration has also extended a $80 million loan to ReElement Technologies, an Indiana firm that is using a new technology to process samarium. A third company, Ucore Rare Metals, from Canada, has received $22.4 million in grant funding from the U.S. military to build a facility dedicated to producing samarium and gadolinium in Louisiana, also using a new technology.

But government support is no guarantee of success. In 2023, Lynas Rare Earths, an Australian mining company, received a Defense Department contract to build a rare-earth processing plant in Seadrift, Texas. The project wasn’t completed. Now Lynas is expanding a plant in Malaysia where it aims to separate samarium and other metals by April.

Skeptics say the Trump administration is giving money to companies that have never made magnets before. They add that much of the funding is going into producing neodymium-iron-boron magnets, not the samarium-cobalt magnets that the defense industry needs most.

The administration’s efforts to boost the industry have prompted a flurry of ambitious announcements. For instance, USA Rare Earth, a company formed in 2019, recently announced plans to build a processing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Last month, it cleared the final hurdle to buy another company: Smith’s Less Common Metals.

[Elk Creek is not a single-commodity mine—it is a seven-critical-mineral platform producing niobium, scandium, titanium, and multiple rare earths, all from a single U.S. site.](https://reddit.com/link/1pyl95h/video/ofhloau905ag1/player)

Given the recent reporting from Reuters and The Seattle Times makes one thing unmistakably clear: **the U.S. has entered a new metals age where every strategic mineral matters**, and supply-chain resilience is now a national security issue. From rare earths to **Niobium, Scandium, and Titanium**, defense planners are no longer optimizing for lowest cost—they are prioritizing **secure, allied-controlled supply** after years of exposure to China-dominated processing and export leverage. The Trump-era push to rebuild domestic critical mineral capacity laid the groundwork, and today’s Pentagon actions show that policy has fully crossed into execution mode.

This backdrop is precisely where **NioCorp stands out**. Elk Creek is not a single-commodity mine—it is a **seven-critical-mineral platform** producing **niobium, scandium, titanium, and multiple rare earths**, all from a single U.S. site. Each of these materials is essential to modern defense and aerospace systems: niobium for high-strength steels and superconducting systems, scandium for lightweight Al-Sc alloys in aircraft and missiles, titanium for structural and corrosion-resistant applications, and rare earths for motors, sensors, and guidance systems. Few projects globally—and almost none in the U.S.—offer this level of mineral diversity under one roof.

[NioCorp & NAMA Al-Sc alloy development with Lockheed and the Pentagon is positioning & addressing the U.S. defense industry where it actually feels supply risk: manufacturable, defense-qualified materials, not just concentrates!  \~NioCorp has solved the Scandium \\""Chicken or the Egg problem!\\""\~](https://reddit.com/link/1pyl95h/video/kj3pkmwj05ag1/player)

What elevates NioCorp further is **NAMA and the move beyond raw materials**. Through Scandium metal production and **Al-Sc alloy development with Lockheed and the Pentagon**, NioCorp is positioning itself where the U.S. defense industry actually feels supply risk: **manufacturable, defense-qualified materials**, not just concentrates. This directly addresses the vulnerability highlighted in recent articles—China doesn’t just mine minerals, it controls processing and value-added steps. NioCorp’s mine-to-metal strategy shortens that chain domestically and makes it far harder to disrupt.

Bottom line: as policymakers now recognize that *every mineral is critical*, projects like Elk Creek become strategically indispensable. When you connect the dots—seven critical minerals, U.S.-based production, alloy manufacturing via NAMA, and active Pentagon partnerships—NioCorp fits squarely into the emerging U.S. and allied playbook for supply-chain security. This isn’t about speculation; it’s about **building the physical backbone of next-generation defense, aerospace, and energy systems inside friendly borders**.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

Context:  

Hi everyone. 27F here.

This year was actually good. I got to travel, try new things and hobbies, opened a business that hit around 6 digits a month, and I moved to a bigger place. I actually let go & just enjoyed life. In past years I cried a lot, but this year I barely did. I just flowed. Just grateful even with the challenges along the way.

But now that the year is ending, I suddenly feel lost and tired in a way that sleep and coffee cannot fix. Since coming home to the province for Christmas, I wake up already exhausted. My body feels tense. Back and shoulder pain everyday. No energy. Sleepy. I get irritated easily, but mostly in my head. I’ve even found myself punching wood sometimes just to release the tension.

Recently, I cried for the first time this year. It was short, then I slept before a road trip. And now I’m having dark thoughts. Not necessarily wanting to do anything, but they’re there in the background. Which scares me because I don’t feel like myself.

I’m in a happy & stable relationship with my partner, but I don’t want to get married or have kids anytime soon. And I don’t know if that confusion is adding to all this.

I feel sad, confused, heavy, and unsure about 2026. With all this, while still waiting for an opportunity on my dream job too (been waiting for years, but now not even sure if I want to do that). 

I don’t know what I want anymore.

Has anyone been through something like this? Is this burnout, depression, hormones, or just a come down after a big year? What helped you reset or make sense of everything?

I’d really appreciate any advice. 🙏

After about ten days of waiting, this order settled into my daily routine fast. The Canada Goose Wyndham became my choice for night walks and colder commutes. It feels protective without feeling stiff and easily gets noticed. The Stone Island jacket was perfect for daytime use, especially for grocery runs or coffee stops where I wanted something light but sharp.

I found myself reaching for the Denim Tears hoodie when I wanted comfort without looking lazy. It’s the kind of hoodie people comment on even when you’re just stepping out briefly. Nike Tech covered my active use cases like jogs and casual walks and it performed exactly as expected. The Balenciaga sweater felt more like a social piece.

I’m looking for some guidance on my recovery journey. I’ve been dealing with chronic brain fog since late November 2019. Around that same time, I suffered a burnout. For a long time, I hoped and assumed the fog was just part of the burnout recovery, especially since I pushed my limits for way too long before crashing.

**Current Symptoms & Triggers:**

* **Daily brain fog:** I’ve experienced it every single day since 2019.
* **Triggers:** Stress, alcohol, and caffeine make the symptoms significantly worse.
* **Status:** I’ve completely quit alcohol. I’m a huge coffee lover, so cutting that out is difficult, but I plan to quit caffeine temporarily early next year to see if I’ve developed an intolerance.

The hardest part is that this is an ""invisible"" illness. People around me think I’m fine because I don't talk about it constantly and I'm still functional, but everything costs me a massive amount of effort. Like many here, I sometimes have that intrusive fear: ""Is this early-onset dementia?"" even though I know it's likely linked to my nervous system or inflammation.

**What I’ve tried so far:**

* **Therapy:** Saw an occupational therapist (ergotherapeut), but they couldn't provide the help I needed.
* **Lifestyle:** I work out 4x a week, my diet is on point, and I take Magnesium, Fish Oil, and Vitamin D3. using daily cumeric.
* **Bloodwork:** I did test my bloodwork and everything was fine
* **Current Supplement:** I’ve been taking **Lion’s Mane** for 2 weeks now.

**My Plan & Questions:** Based on research (Reddit/Post-COVID sites), I’m looking into adding **NAC, NADH, and Resveratrol**. Someone also suggested the combination of **nicotinamide B3?** and **5htp**. **Nicotin Plasters,** but for how long? I’m also considering **Probiotics**, and eventually looking into **SSRIs or Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)** if needed.

However, I want to be methodical. I don't want to start everything at once because I want to know what actually works.

1. Should I stick with the Lion’s Mane for a few more weeks before adding anything else?
2. In what order would you introduce NAC, NADH, or Resveratrol?
3. Has anyone with a similar ""burnout/post-viral"" timeline seen success with a specific protocol?

I would really appreciate it if someone with experience could help guide me in structuring this supplement trial. There is an endless of different outcomes, it's a bit overwhelming.",0,1767010969.0,covidlonghaulers,2,0.33,False

I have a couple of questions if anyone can help please x

I used to drink a lot of caffeine, but trying to cut down while going through IVF. I have one cup of coffee per day, usually Starbucks nespresso house blend (one capsule) which I believe is around 80mg. Is that okay? My clinic says 200mg max but my doctor said only half of one cup per day. 

Second question…where I live (the UK) the BMI limit is set at 30 for NHS IVF and 32 for private. I crash dieted to get my BMI below the limit but after having the stims plus steroids I gained 10kg. I’m not crash dieting again before the next cycle but just wondering, is there a limit in the U.S? We may consider going there if it means I don’t have to keep yo yo dieting.

Thanks in advance for answers x
