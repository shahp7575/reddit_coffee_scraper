I'm almost 4 weeks out from surgery and still having the fun of nerve pain/twitches/spasms from those ""waking up"" but the most annoying thing is my right eyeball will roll to the outside and I have to rub it to roll back - which can only last for a few minutes. It always happens when I wake up but can take hours before I stop having Marty Feldman eyes (yes, the parody song is playing in my head, yes, it's on YouTube). My surgeon tried not to laugh which was hard because I was serious but not serious explaining what a day with your eyeball suddenly rolling where it wanted to go instead of where I wanted it to be but seeing more than I thought has happened a few times. I did get to see the cat yarf in the other room while trying to make coffee this morning, I don't suggest trying to do that intentionally. She composed herself and pressed on the muscles around my eye and restructured temple noting I needed to massage it more often since it was healing. I do appreciate her using muscle to fill in the crater that would have been on my temple, I just wish she'd told me this could happen, and at my age (60's), Marty Feldman was a common reference with friends especially when they got really drunk. Radiation therapy starts in 2 weeks so I have a little more time to get that muscle loosened up so my eyeball won't be ""off"" after treatment, it's bad enough I had *half* of a facelift and have to wait a year to do the left side to match.

I have a dark sense of humor, heck, my entire family does! When my granddaughter was born it only took her first real sentence to realize it must be an inherited gene because she has it too. When I told my son I had cancer and what type, he immediately said ""Mom, this isn't what's going to kill you. (pause) Stepping off a curb and a moped....that is more likely"". I knew right then he was right and haven't had much for worry aside from a day or two but it took that off sense of humor to put everything into perspective.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the classic tale of two teams trying to avoid the dreaded relegation zone, like two cats fighting over the last can of tuna. On April 24th, Legan√©s will host Girona at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque in what promises to be a nail-biter, or maybe just a nail-filer, depending on your level of optimism.

Legan√©s, who have been yo-yoing between divisions like a caffeine-fueled squirrel, are currently in a bit of a pickle. Despite their recent promotion back to La Liga, they've been about as consistent as a politician's promises, managing only a few draws and a couple of wins since January. Their last match was a riveting 0-0 draw with Mallorca, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry.

Girona, on the other hand, are having a season that could be best described as ""meh."" After finishing third last season, they've found themselves in a downward spiral, losing several matches including a 1-3 defeat to Betis. It's like they peaked too early and are now desperately trying to remember how to play football.

The bookmakers have Legan√©s as the underdogs with odds ranging from 9.5 to 10.5, while Girona is favored with odds around 1.57. The draw is priced between 2.8 and 3.05, which might just be the safest bet considering both teams' current form.

For those looking to spice things up, the best bet here might be to take Girona with a -0.75 handicap at 1.78. Sure, it's a bit risky, but hey, fortune favors the bold‚Äîor at least those who are willing to take a calculated gamble.

So, grab your popcorn, or perhaps a strong cup of coffee, and get ready for what could be a thrilling encounter, or at the very least, a good excuse to avoid doing chores on a Thursday evening.

Before I had surgery I saw someone posted their surgery blog and it helped me SO much that I decided to do one too. So just like the other person, I plan to add on as time goes on. 

Please excuse any grammar errors as I will be writing some of this while high lol

My Lipo 360 Blog: 

Before the surgery preparation:

Exercise: I spent 8 months doing pilates in preparation for this. I read that if you have abs and good muscle tone the recovery process is much easier. 

Prebiotics/Probiotics: I did two months of AG1. It‚Äôs expensive and doesn‚Äôt taste wonderful but I used orange juice to blend and it made it more tolerable. I took this juice every morning before anything (even coffee). I noticed a significant decrease in my bloat and I even started losing some weight. I didn‚Äôt want to lose too much weight though so I allowed myself to eat some not so healthy things. Still continued to eat healthy but just allowed myself to be less militant about it. 

Meal prep: made up fruit/spinach smoothie bags (just add milk and blend), yogurt/fruit parfaits (just add granola), cut watermelon, pineapple for snacks. * after thought I wish I also prepared animal crackers and pretzels 

Mental health prep: Started meditating a few days prior. Lots of breathing (this also helps your body to prevent pneumonia)

Bedside prep: bought plants for each end table (plants help heal), bed tray for easy reach (notebook/pen, medicines, tv remote, chapstick, body wash wipes, etc.), bought PO pillows - includes 6 pillows. Two to incline your upper body and head, two to elevate your legs and two for your arms. Protective pad to prevent any leakage from running your sheets and mattress. 

Post Op prep: Sheewee! Best $10 I‚Äôve ever spent. I had no idea this product existed until I read it on Reddit. You get to stand while peeing and it‚Äôs amazing not to have to squat down to the toilet. Compression socks - I already had some but if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a must! Helps venous circulation to help prevent blood clots. 

Clothing prep: buy black or dark colored pjs for surgery. Make sure they are loose and the top has a button up or zip up. Pull out clothing for after surgery. Have loose dresses and a robe available. I‚Äôm told that you won‚Äôt want to dress while recovering. Prepare loose shoes for after surgery. Slippers would be best but I didn‚Äôt have slippers so I loosened an old pair of sneakers shoelaces so I could easily slip on and off.

Surgery Day: woke up early, did a meditation then a shower. Had a to-go bag prepared with medicine, paperwork, towel/chucks for car ride home, chapstick). Had husband drive me to the facility. Walked in gave a urine sample to show I‚Äôm not pregnant, got changed into gown and hair net. They got an IV on my forearm and started fluids. Doc came in and marked my skin. Anesthesia doc came in and discussed everything with me. Walked into the OR and laid down on the bed. Had a conversation about my job, Bmore city, city‚Äôs attempt at gentrification, then I fell asleep. Woke up in the OR to assist the nurses putting on my faja. Then woke up again in recovery. Woke up happy and cracking jokes. They told me they called my husband and he was on his way in. He walked in and we chatted some but the next 30 min was a blur. Surgery took about 5 hours and they removed 4450 mL of fat. Then I walked to the bathroom to pee. Started feeling pain so I took oxy5mg. Got into wheelchair and they put my shoes on. Wheeled me out to the car. Car ride was fine but I was very high. Got home, managed the steps okay and got into bed which was already prepared with post op pillows, protective pad and chucks. I slept for a few hours then woke up in some pain bc it was time for my next oxy. I was hoping to take ibuprofen instead of oxy but it was not enough so I took the oxy. 

PO Day1: Woke up at 1am in pain but I was 1 hour too early for meds. I need to wait til 2am. Fell back asleep and woke up at 4a in a lot of pain. Took my oxy. Waited for it to kick in before getting out of bed to pee. Went to the bathroom which I‚Äôve done several times since I got home and was using my SheWee which is the best $10 I‚Äôve ever spent. Highly recommend it! *of note I was informed later by my doctor that I should have just taken the medicine even though it wasn‚Äôt time. 

7am I had to pee again.  Got up from bed and felt dizzy. Sat there for a few then got up. I was in pain. Got to the bathroom and started to feel nauseous and questioned if I might pass out. Finished up and started to walk back when I got all the symptoms and was absolutely about to pass out. Ears ringing, blurred vision, super sweaty, whole body was tingling. I quickly threw myself on the bed, put my feet up and yelled for a cool rag. Took anti nausea med and used the cool rag all over my face and chest. Then after a few minutes which felt like forever I started feeling better. Checked my fitbit and it said 60BPM. Who knows how low it got when I was pre-syncopal. I attribute it to the pain, nausea and empty stomach. *i found out later this was not the cause. 

9am I was getting up to leave for my PO appointment I had another near syncope episode. Managed to pass it and make it to my appointment. All they were going to do was take off bandages and take pictures but another episode was happening and I was about to pass out again. They immediately laid me back and put cool rags on me. They left the remaining bandages on and got a glucose reading which measured high. Doctor came in and explained her concern that I was severely dehydrated and wanted me to have fluids. I explained to my doctor that I was extremely shocked by this because I have been adamant about drinking water and 0-sugar gatorlytes! She mentioned the possibility of anemia, which I agree, maybe I was. So then they stated me on an IV but it took an hour of poking and prodding before until they could finally get a vein. My veins were so small because of my state of dehydration. They administered 2 bags of fluids and then I was sent home. I felt so much better afterwards and didn‚Äôt have another episode since (ü§ûüèº). 

Got home, ate my first real meal since surgery: soup and sandwich, then I napped and walked a bunch to finish the day. 

PO day 2: Sharp burning feet pain. Turns out it‚Äôs nerve pain and is normal. Gabapentin helped with this. Super itchy- again nerve related stuff. My antihistamine helped with this. Other than that I feel more energized and in a much better mood. Yesterday I was very irritable and apologized to my husband for being cranky. Felt better than yesterday. So good that I walked down 2 flights of steps to grab a prepared lunch and walked back up 2 flights. It was good to get steps in especially to prevent clots and pneumonia. This was the extent of movement though, I didn‚Äôt want to overdo it.

Symptom summary after surgery:

I ordered iced coffee this morning, usually takes no more than 20 minutes as it's only 2 miles away (no I'm not walking 4 miles for coffee). I was in a meeting when I realized it had been nearly 20 minutes since I got the ""dasher headed to you"" message, so I checked the app. Dasher was still a mile away and unmoving. I messaged asking if they were ok and got no reply. I called, and she answered eventually, telling me she ran outta gas and could I meet her at my gate. 

I don't have a gate. She's in the wrong place (on the way to my home, but still a mile out) AND out of gas with my iced coffee melting for the past 20 minutes. I tell her obviously I can't meet her, hence the use of doordash for coffee that I could have gotten myself had I the means. I told her I'll cancel and reorder.

Note: yes, you read it right, she only needed to go 2 more miles and ran out halfway. Also, there's a gas station literally 100 feet from where she grabbed my coffee. 

Doordash support then calls and asks me to meet her, kept pushing to get her on a group call to coordinate. No. Cancel and reassign. ""Well she's at your gate"" no she's not, I don't even have a gate. I send pic of the map showing her location and  my pin, a mile apart.  Still asks to bring her into the call to ""sort it out""  because they insist she's close enough ""at my gate"" she's not at my damn gate! Tf?? She's OUT OF GAS. What in the world is a group call gonna do besides delay my coffee longer? I'm not walking a mile to get melty coffee, not to mention the fees and tip I paid, and what, I just leave her there stranded after I take my coffee? Akward, inconvenient, hot. Just NO. I darn near had to yell cancel the freakin order and restart, period. Is this ok to you?

TL;DR: Ordered iced coffee, dasher ran outta gas a mile away, and was already headed to the wrong place. After 20+ minutes, Doordash support tries to bully me into walking to meet the dasher instead of canceling and reassigning. Had to get loud to get a remake. To me, unacceptable.

1k6yu8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1k6yu8s/how_do_i_prevent_rust_on_metal_outdoor_chairs/,How do I prevent rust on metal outdoor chairs?,"When James moved into his new home with a cozy backyard, he was excited to finally have a space to unwind. He bought a set of sleek metal outdoor chairs, imagining slow weekend mornings with coffee and quiet evenings under the stars. The chairs looked great‚Äîsturdy, stylish, and perfect for the space.

But a few months in, after a particularly rainy week, James noticed tiny orange spots forming on the legs of one of the chairs. He didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bit of dirt,‚Äù he told himself. But when he tried to wipe it off, he realized it wasn‚Äôt dirt at all‚Äîit was rust.

Worried he might have made a mistake with his purchase, James jumped online and started digging through forums, home improvement blogs, and YouTube tutorials. He found that rust on outdoor metal furniture is a pretty common issue, especially if the chairs aren‚Äôt treated properly or if they‚Äôre left exposed to the elements without any protection.

So, James decided to take action before the rust spread. The first thing he did was scrub the rusty spots with a wire brush and some steel wool. It took a bit of elbow grease, but eventually, the rust came off. Then he used a rust converter spray, something a DIY YouTuber had recommended. The spray chemically transformed any remaining rust into a protective coating.

Once the rust was dealt with, James focused on prevention. Based on what he read and watched, the key was creating a barrier between the metal and the moisture. He bought a can of clear outdoor metal sealant‚Äîspecifically one labeled ‚Äúrust-preventive‚Äù and ‚ÄúUV-resistant‚Äù‚Äîand applied a couple of coats to the entire set. It dried quickly and left the chairs with a nice, slightly glossy finish.

A tip he picked up that made a surprising difference: he added plastic caps to the feet of the chairs. Apparently, moisture can get trapped inside the legs if they sit directly on wet ground or a damp deck. The caps lifted the chairs slightly and kept water from pooling inside the tubes.

James also made a habit of covering the furniture when rain was in the forecast. He bought a waterproof cover that fit over the entire set, which helped keep everything dry and clean. In the winter, he stored the chairs in the garage, something others had mentioned as a smart seasonal move.

By the time the next spring rolled around, James was thrilled to see the chairs looking just as good as when he first bought them‚Äîno rust, no flaking paint, just clean, solid metal. The whole experience taught him that with a little maintenance and the right protective steps, outdoor metal furniture could last for years without rust taking over.

It was a bit of a learning curve, but James felt like he‚Äôd cracked the code. Now, whenever a friend mentions their rusty patio set, he‚Äôs got a whole list of tips ready to go.",1,1745517586.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve made lots of sacrifices in this relationship which I‚Äôm happy to do as I‚Äôve never loved anyone the way I love him. He has 3 kids to 3 women, one of which lives with him (11f) I‚Äôm buying us a house (he rents and I own a home, so buying us a home near where he lives). 
It‚Äôs the Easter holidays and his sister was to call today but out of the blue my family (mum, dad and brother) rang to say they were coming up and could we meet them for lunch and call to see the new house that‚Äôs sale agreed (it‚Äôs quite a distance) we rearranged with his sister but as soon as his daughter heard this she was suddenly sick and didn‚Äôt want to go as is the case any time we go to go somewhere she doesn‚Äôt want to (she has social anxiety and is used to always getting own way) my partner was apologetic and said it‚Äôs quote hard dealing with her attitude.
I went on ahead and spent the afternoon with my family. We had a lovely time, lovely lunch, then drove up to the new house, then went to a shopping centre, before we parted ways we went for a coffee and my daddy who is a painter surprised me saying that when we get the keys he‚Äôll come up and stay a few days and decorate for us foc, I was delighted and grateful. 
I went back to my boyfriends and now he‚Äôs annoyed with me?? 
I was annoyed as I do so much for his daughter which I do not begrudge as I love her too but the one time my family came up she pulled the sick card which her dad knows she does. 
He turned it on me saying I should be more empathetic and he made out that it‚Äôs a bad thing that my dad offered to do the work for us foc- he should have been consulted first? He said I should want to get in our new house first before anyone else and I explained my dad wanted an empty house to work in over a course of a couple of days as it‚Äôs easier than working round people.

They did not move our belongings safely or effectively. This will be a long review, but I will cover: the moving process, the attitude of the moving team, and the (lack of) customer service while remediating damages. Our move should have been a simple one, but Two Men and a Truck managed to damage items, both homes (the ones being moved from and to), and have since gone silent regarding an agreement/settlement.

The team was unorganized, slow, rude, confrontational, and seemed to lack skills required to move. They damaged a priceless family heirloom that cannot be repaired or replaced. We paid for the extra insurance (valuation) only to find that this insurance seems to have no effect on the resolution process. Two Men and a Truck are also exceptionally slow in their moving. For instance, three of them attempted to take the legs off of a coffee table which easily fit through a door (this cost us 20 minutes of moving time before we told them we'd move it in ourselves). To make matters worse, they attempted to hide the fact they broke an office desk by placing the top on the desk and leaving it in the room. We later uncovered a massive gouge left in a recently refinished hardwood floor that they had covered with a piece of furniture.

The process to address these concerns has been completely lacking. They initially sent an advisor to assess the damage, who asked to borrow OUR tools to fix one of the items! We were later told that they would instead compensate us for fixing the damages ourselves. Their offer was insultingly low ($200, and remember we paid $100 extra for insurance), and they have since stopped responding in any timely fashion. In short, this company has caused damages and headaches that they seem unable to address.

Final list of damages caused by Two Men and a Truck: hardwood (house 1), hardwood (house 2), paint at both houses, door trim, gramophone (family heirloom), office desk, couch, wallpaper, wood trim, drywall.

I will consider revising or removing this post if our concerns are ever resolved in a satisfactory manner.",9,1745517381.0,Winnipeg,3,0.85,False

It's hard because he's the happiest boy alive until he sees me. Then it's crying and trying to climb up my leg in panic because mom = boob.

He fails to notice the signal change.
People on the sidewalk stand and stare.
He tries to shake it off, to keep going,
but the edges remain blurred,
caught somewhere between sleep and the pull of the day.

The world feels warm and weightless,
a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Eyes open first, then motion.
Sheets slip, phone in hand, feet hit the floor.
The rhythm kicks in.

He‚Äôs up. 
Emails flash.
Three flagged, nothing unexpected, text from brother. 
It can wait.

Down the stairs; momentum and cadence. A slight groove moves in. 

The click of the coffee, the hiss of the shower, water running over his body, the toothbrush scrapes to tempo, a sip and a spit. Each motion part of the score.

Back to the kitchen;the coffee machine spurts and exhales, settling in to the final drip like a cymbal tap before the downbeat.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look.

Coffee cup, phone, wallet, and keys; door swings open, the song surges on.

He steps into the morning, already carried by the melody of the day.

Two beats to unlock.

Handle. Door. Engine.

The car hums beneath him; a steady vibration through the wheel, a muted score that accompanies the unfolding morning. 

Outside, the world drifts by in soft impressions: porch lights dimming, streetlights melting into a pale blue haze, and the rhythm of passing buildings, a series of blurred images.


Aaron is elsewhere.

The windshield frames his reality into discrete, predictable sequences. The dashboard glows with quiet authority: temperature settings, fuel readings, and a curated selection of radio signals all ready to command. 

He adjusts the climate, tweaks the volume, and skips a song. Small rituals while the predetermined flow of traffic and routine carries him forward.

His shoulders settle, but the rhythm is off now.

Three points. Stay ahead.

Cost. Stability. Projections.

The car continues along its predetermined path, a small vessel that carries him forward while enclosing him within a cocoon of climate control and light entertainment. 

The light ahead shifts orange.

Commit.

His foot presses down, smooth, measured. As he clears the intersection, a flash of motion in his periphery, standing on the corner just past the intersection.

A solitary figure. Waving? Or‚Ä¶ signaling? 

A momentary flicker of curiosity, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt stick. The thought doesn‚Äôt fade so much as correct itself, overwritten before it can linger. A window washer or just someone waiting to cross the street, he thinks.

Handle. Door. Engine.

The car hums beneath him, a warm greeting. Adjust climate, tune the radio, volume down.

The morning moves like the space between worlds, almost organic in its directedness and purpose. One car after another, all in line. A signal and move. Another and stop. Always forward and with a practiced agency.

Numbers.
Projections.
Three points. Stability. No excess.

He repeats them like a mantra.
Carter will press if he senses any doubt.

The turn signal ticks in time with his thoughts.
He shifts in his seat, breath steady. But beneath that calm, something simmers.

A bus idles at the curb ahead, brake lights pulsing like a slow heartbeat.

An old man sits hunched beside it, spine curled forward, as if the weight of the world had settled on his back. His gaze fixed on something distant, as if waiting for more than just the next bus.

The car rolls past before he can place what about him feels wrong.

Numbers. Stability. Keep moving.

He approaches the same intersection,
the one from yesterday and the day before.
He can‚Äôt help but look.

This time, he sees the man clearly,
standing on the corner, waving.

Not at anyone in particular.
Just‚Ä¶waving.
An odd, rhythmic motion.
Up, down. Up, down.
Like a beckoning cat.

His curiosity begins to pull his thought, ‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù
The question doesn‚Äôt fade as quickly this time.
It lingers, circling in his mind.

A reflex says: categorize it,
file it away as meaningless or relevant.
But he can‚Äôt decide.

Why would he act just to act?

The car hums beneath him. The world slides past in practiced motion.

‚ÄúWhy wave? At what?‚Äù

And his face.

Blank.

Not frantic, not pleading. A loop. An insistence.

The man stares ahead but doesn‚Äôt seem to focus on anything.

Expressionless.

As if nothing existed beyond the wave.

More unsettling than the motion itself.

He shifts his grip on the wheel,
but the light turns green before he can register more.

The car moves on, carrying him forward,
the intersection already behind him.

His shoulders tense,
and the day‚Äôs mental script stutters.

Revised figures first, concise, controlled.
Anticipate objections. Frame it early.
No drift. No excess.
Three core points: cost, projections, stability.

He exhales, tries to focus,
but the steady rhythm of the day feels‚Ä¶off.
The thought doesn‚Äôt fade. It loiters. The man‚Äôs blank stare and aimless gesture, like it should mean something but doesn‚Äôt quite.

He arrives at the office lot. 

Ignition. Click. Door.

The morning meets him again, its quiet rhythm already in motion. He steps back in, a little off beat, yet still carried away by the melody of the day.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks inside,
the air warms around him, weightless;
a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Eyes open, then motion.
Feet find the floor, phone in hand,
and the routine starts again.

He‚Äôs up.
Emails flash, four flagged. Nothing urgent.
A voicemail from his brother. No immediate reply.

Down the stairs,
the pattern replays, day after day,
yet each time a touch different.

Click. Hiss. Water on skin. Toothbrush scrapes, sip, spit.
His morning ritual humming along, a choreographed rhythm of necessity.

In the kitchen,
the coffee machine exhales,
easing into its final drip.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look;
coffee cup, phone, wallet, keys.

Keys?
He just saw them.
Not in the dish. Not on the wall. 

A pause. 

There next to the fridge. 
He shakes it off.

Door swings wide, the melody continues.

Two beats to unlock:

Handle. Door. Engine.

The morning moves as it should:
Streetlights flicker out. The highway breathes, steady. The dashboard hums with quiet certainty.

Except...

Something lags. 

It‚Äôs there, just beneath his morning rhythm, moving out of sync. 

He wonders about the man.

Why stand on a corner, waving at nothing? Or everything? 

Maybe it's mental illness, that would make sense. That would‚Ä¶ explain it.

The thought brings a flicker of relief. A neat diagnosis. A box to place the inexplicable in.

But almost immediately, another thought intrudes; can you imagine that life?

 Every day, the same thing, day in and day out, like a compulsion. 

And then another.

If his ritual is madness, what about mine? The question almost makes him laugh.

He grips the wheel. Eyes forward. The world sliding past in practiced motion.

The Thought Lands Lightly at First.

The wave is absurd, but so is everything, if you look at it long enough.

Isn‚Äôt this what we do? Isn‚Äôt this what life becomes?

One man waves at no one. The other moves through a commute, through meetings, through polite nods and expected answers. His hands gripping the wheel, his voice rehearsing the same conversations day after day.

Routine. Structure. Stability.

Or is it repetition? Script? Compulsion?

The Thought Sinks Deeper.

He grips the wheel tighter. When did he start doing that? How long has he been white-knuckling his way down this road without noticing?

His fingers flex. Release. But the stiffness remains.

Maybe the difference between them is only in degrees.

Maybe there is no difference.

He wakes at the same time every day. Brushes his teeth. Pulls on the same set of clothes, different in detail, identical in function. The coffee goes in the cup. The cup goes in the car. The car goes on the road. The road goes to the office. The office swallows him whole.

Good morning, how are you? Good. How was your weekend? Fine.

Fine. Good. Fine. Good. Fine. Good.

Words exchanged like tokens in a machine. Not because they mean anything, but because they must be said. Because silence is unacceptable. Because he has a role to play, and roles require lines, and lines must be spoken or the whole fragile performance collapses.

His life is a series of dictated movements. A program, running flawlessly. He could be dead right now and no one would notice, so long as his body kept moving through the expected spaces.

The thought begins to fracture.

He watches himself from outside, like a ghost hovering over his own life.

When did this start? Was it always like this?

Maybe it began when he was a child. Wake up, school, home, dinner, bed. Maybe it started when he got the job. Or when he first signed a lease. Or when he first realized that the world does not bend to human longing, only to routine.

Or maybe he was born into it. Maybe it was set before he even arrived. A map, a circuit, a pre-scripted existence that only felt like choice.

He turns the wheel without thinking. The car follows the motion, as it always does. A practiced motion. A gesture.

Like a wave.

The breaklights bleed in front of him, the light ahead shifts red.

First, a pause. 

Then, a full stop.

Now he looks.

Not just a glance. Not a flicker.

The man is there. Not calling out, not reacting, simply doing.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

Like a song played on loop, like a phrase repeated until it loses meaning.

Who is he waving to?

No one.

Or everyone.

Or just himself.

The driver‚Äôs fingers tighten on the wheel.

He should look away.

But something about the man, about the gesture, keeps him locked in place.

Not random.
Not reactive.
Not, normal.

Something else.

The wave means something. It has to.

A thing is either meant or meaningless. Isn‚Äôt it?

Isn‚Äôt it?

And for the first time, the driver really looks at him.

The man stands under the cool morning sun, the pale light catching the crisp, almost stiff fabric of his sky-blue winter coat.

 It looks fresh, untouched by wear, its color stark against the muted tones of the waking world. 

His black hat, ear flaps down, frames a face rough with stubble, the bristles catching in the slanted light.

His jeans are stiff, unfaded. His shoes, uncreased and spotless. No frayed edges, no stains. Not what the driver expected.

If the man had been ragged, hungry, pleading, there‚Äôd be something of sense in it.

But this?

Well-fed. Upright. Strong enough to keep standing, to keep waving.

Someone, somewhere, cares for him.

Someone makes sure his clothes are clean.
Someone makes sure he eats.
Someone makes sure he is okay enough to stand here, to wave, to do this.

There is care here. Perhaps tragic, perhaps beautiful?

Someone loves this strange man.

And just like that, the wave is no longer empty.

It holds a history he will never know, a story he wants to but can‚Äôt piece together.

Why is he here? Who lets him be here? Does anyone try to stop him?

Does anyone come for him at night?
Does someone wait at home?
Does someone else wonder where he goes?

Then suddenly, another thought:

Am I known like that?

If someone loves the waving man, does someone love me in my own routines? 

Or am I as much an oddity to those who pass by me?

Does someone watch my patterns, my motions, and wonder why?

The light turns green.

His car rolls forward.

The man shrinks in the mirror.

The rhythm lingers.

His mind drifts, but the motion follows.

Three points. Stay ahead.
If Carter presses
Cost. Stability. Projections.

His fingers tap the wheel, falling into time.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

The thought doesn‚Äôt fade.

But now, it doesn‚Äôt just linger.

It follows.

He arrives at the office lot,
where colleagues wave.
Colleagues wave. He mirrors them, but his hand feels distant, a separate thing.

As he walked in, a warmth in the air; soft, weightless, like something dissolving.

A melody, faint but rising.

A held note.

A repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Eyes open.

No alarm, no thought; just motion.

Sheets slip, feet press the floor. A few beats, then a body already moving before the mind catches up.

Down the stairs, momentum, gravity. The groove settles in.

Click. The aroma of coffee already in the air. 
Hiss. Water rolls over his skin, pooling at his collarbone, slipping down his spine. 
The toothbrush scrapes its rhythmic churn, water washing out what‚Äôs left of the morning.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.
Breathe again.

Everything is in place. Every gesture intact. A structure so seamless it does not require will.

But today, something drags; a ripple beneath the surface.

Not the wave. Not yet.

Something else.

His brother‚Äôs voicemail still sits unanswered. He hasn‚Äôt opened it. Doesn‚Äôt need to. He already knows.

Memory hovers: his father in bed, staring at a dimly lit TV, eyes empty, one hand gripping an arm that‚Äôs too stiff to move on its own now.

Dementia, the doctors said.

The man who raised him, now repeating the same stories, the same questions.
Loops.

Mind and body, worn down like used tools.

Yesterday, his father asked about a dog they never had.

Then again. Same question. Same inflection. And again. No memory of the last time he asked. No sense of repetition.

Each time, a new moment. Real. Immediate. Entirely his own.

His brother wants him to visit. ""Just go along with it,"" he wrote last time. ""Just say yes to whatever he remembers.""

But something about that feels obscene, a false world, a hollow performance. 

He wants to scorn the disease that holds his father hostage.
That locks him inside some lonely darkness. Just go along with it. 

And yet, what else is there? What else can be done?
He‚Äôll go this weekend.

One last look,
coffee cup, phone, wallet, keys.
Door swings wide, the melody continues.

Two beats to unlock:

A pause

Handle. Door. Engine.

The highway hums beneath him. The morning moves as it should.
And yet-
thought pulls differently today:
The wave; absurd yet necessary, meaningless yet vital. 

A function, a ritual. A thing to do.

His father. The waving man. Himself. Each caught in something.

One repeats a question. One repeats a wave. One repeats a life. The difference? Only in degrees.

The intersection nears.
The man is there. 

Up. Down. Up. Down.

A part of him wants to look away; keep moving, keep structure intact. 

But today, the gesture is no longer strange. It is familiar. Maybe even inevitable.

He slows. The light is still green, but he slows.

If he responds to the wave, will that create meaning? Does he become a witness and in that witnessing, create something? 

And, before he fully realizes what he‚Äôs doing, he raises his hand. 

A small movement, barely displaced in the air. 

Not a wave, not exactly. But something close.

In that moment, something sharpens. Something clears. 

The distance collapses.
Two figures on opposite sides of the glass, moving within loops they do not fully choose, fulfilling gestures they cannot name.  Waiting maybe, for someone to acknowledge that they see, that they know, that they, too, are seen.
He holds the gesture a fraction too long. And then...

Nothing. No reaction. No shift. No break in the rhythm.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

The man does not acknowledge him.
And yet, it is enough.

Because now, he knows: he is no different.
The wave was always his.
The wave had always belonged to him. He just couldn't see it.

As the car moves forward, as the moment slips into the mirror, he feels it; not an answer, not an understanding, but an acceptance.

The loop continues.

But this time, he is inside it.

This time, it belongs to him.

A breath, a settling.

His thoughts gather, drawn forward, refocusing on the day ahead.

The office lot appears as it always does; unchanged, waiting.

He pulls in.

Engine off. Handle. Door.

He steps back into the morning, carried again by the melody of the day.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks in, the edges begin to blur.
He feels the warmth of the air, weightless, a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

The edges blur, warmth of the air, weightless, the melody fades 
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Do you remember that dog we used to have?

Tap. Tap.

Fanfic - Third Edition: Cinematic Scars and Coffee Cups




Chapter 6: Cinematic Scars and Coffee Cups

The caf√© is tucked away between narrow streets and memories Elio didn‚Äôt mean to remember. It smells like roasted beans and rain on cobblestone. He‚Äôs early. Always is, these days. He watches the door like it owes him something.

Matthieu arrives ten minutes late, wearing sunglasses even though the sun barely exists. He slides into the seat like he‚Äôs been there a thousand times before. Like this is normal. It isn‚Äôt.

They don‚Äôt greet each other. Just silence. Just steaming cups and glances that scream louder than mouths ever could.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be around you in daylight,‚Äù Elio says finally, stirring his coffee even though he takes it black.

Matthieu smirks. ‚ÄúGood. That means it‚Äôs real.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a pause, then Elio: ‚ÄúYou ever look at someone and feel like‚Ä¶ they know all your secrets without asking?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll the time.‚Äù Matthieu meets his eyes. ‚ÄúUsually when I look at you.‚Äù

Oof. Right in the unresolved trauma.

The table between them feels like a battlefield. Napkins. Half-finished poems. A song Matthieu scribbled on the back of a receipt, titled Lavender Skies and Lies That Taste Like Wine.

‚ÄúWas it about me?‚Äù Elio asks, fingers grazing the paper.

Matthieu doesn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúEvery one of them is.‚Äù

The weight of it hits like a freight train. They‚Äôre not just two boys in a caf√©. They‚Äôre living epilogues to stories never finished.

And just before Matthieu leaves, he leans down and whispers‚Äî

‚ÄúYou haunt me, Elio. And I don‚Äôt think I want to be saved from it.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî
Chapter 7: Fragments of Us

That night, Elio walks home alone. The streets are quiet, but his mind isn‚Äôt. He replays every glance, every line, every scar Matthieu never hid.

He doesn‚Äôt cry. Not yet.

But he does play Euphories on repeat. Alone. In the dark.

And somehow, it feels like Matthieu is still singing just for him.

At the time I was diagnosed my assessor agreed I have adhd, but said that it was mild bc I have found hacks to make sure important admin and uni work always gets done. The problem is that I am incredibly impulsive (especially with eating and spending) and incredibly disorganised (my parents have to put everything just so so im able to cook in the first place, and im crippled by physical paperwork, if its not digital I'll lose it). I get burnt out horrifically easy as well.




 Ive noticed that if I ingest just the right amount of caffiene i can help alievate these symptoms and give myself a good wired feeling for a few hours, but its hard to know what exactly that perfect amount is, so I figure I should try proper meds instead of self medicating with caffiene and to a lesser extent vitamin b complex.




The thing with me is that im incredibly sensitive to caffiene, I have no experience with other stimulants bar nicotine. Its very easy for me to make my panic disorder worse with too much coffee, and the other night I had 3 vodka cokes at the club and couldn't sleep for hours when I got home, and ive had similar experiences before so I know I shouldn't have drank cola after lunch but I stupidly did it anyway.




If anyone is like me, or knows things about adhd medication, what are the different drugs on offer and what makes the most sense for my condition? I already take antidepressants and antipsychotics for my panic disorder. I vaguely remember reading something on an adhd sub ages ago about a doctor increasing the stimulant dose when the patient didn't want to, and im terrified they'll do that to me.",2,1745517255.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

**""The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison."" - Fyodor Dostoevsky.**

Fyodor Dostoevsky was a Russian novelist and an Orthodox Christian who believed that the power of faith and human reason is limited by their ability to discover truth. He said this quote in 1864, but there‚Äôs no confirmed date. Despite how old this quote is, it still applies to most of the people in this room who are prisoners to something without even realizing it. I was guilty of it too, and it‚Äôs because of how normalized these devices have become. You‚Äôre probably wondering now, ‚ÄúWell, what am I a prisoner to, Mr. Crazy Man?‚Äù It‚Äôs simple‚Äîour phones.

Somewhere down the line, these pocket prisons began to run our lives. We have become so reliant on these rectangles for information, connection, and entertainment that we‚Äôve forgotten what it means to simply exist without them. These devices, which many of us consider a good thing because of the surface-level productivity and connection, have morphed into modern-day crack pipes, offering easy fixes for boredom through doom scrolling and a constant stream of content and dopamine. There‚Äôs even a whole new term for it, it‚Äôs called being ‚Äúchronically online‚Äù, that is how bad our generation's management of screentime, and time as a whole ingereal is.¬†

Let‚Äôs consider all the long-term effects of all this. Research shows that excessive screen time is linked to most mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and loneliness. To build off this, a April 22, 2025 study done by the PEW Research Center said that roughly 1 in 5 teens say social media hurts their mental health. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which I will refer to as the AACAP from here on out, and it was discovered that ninety percent of teens have used social media. Seventy-five percent report having at least one active social media profile, and 51% report visiting a social media site at least daily. These stats are making a dark connection, one that genuinely makes me sad. Nearly every teenager today is active on social media, using platforms that are basically a part of our daily lives. A survey showed that the average teenager will spend around 4.8 hours on our phone. Stanford Lifestyle Medicine performed a study and published it on May 30th, 2024, and it said that ‚Äúresearch shows that adult brains are also negatively impacted by excessive screen time, defined as [more than two hours](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm) a day outside of work hours.‚Äù end quote. While social media provides a space for connection and self-expression, it also exposes us to a barrage of unrealistic expectations and pressures that can lead to anxiety, depression, and feelings of inadequacy. This may seem counterintuitive‚Äîafter all, isn‚Äôt social media supposed to connect us? But herein lies the paradox.

When we open our feeds, we are shown idealized versions of life‚Äîframes that manipulate our perception of reality. It‚Äôs all fake, it‚Äôs always fake, everything we see is a false reality manipulated by the influencer. All these celebrities with unrealistic physiques, way too much wealth, and too much time on their hands use it to their advantage. When we see their fancy life, we yearn for it, we want it just as much. It keeps you coming back for more, creating a never-ending cycle. We compare ourselves to these polished images, leading to feelings of jealousy and discontent. I want you to take a moment and think about the last time you found yourself feeling worse after spending time on social media. Do you know what I mean? You could have been enjoying a lovely day, and just a few minutes of scrolling could have left you feeling anxious and empty.

But here‚Äôs the shocking part: that‚Äôs the point. Social media is designed to keep us engaged, often at the expense of our mental well-being. It plays on our psychological impulses, rewarding us with likes, comments, and shares, tiny hits of dopamine that condition us to keep coming back for more. Platforms manipulate our needs for validation and connection, trapping us in a cycle that can be hard to break. All of the cheap dopamine is so addicting, and trust me, I understand it. Because I‚Äôve been planning this speech since we first talked about a persuasive speech. I knew my topic was going to be persuading people to limit screen time and setting boundaries on their phones. So logically, if I wanted to do a speech on it, I‚Äôd HAVE to do it.

	So I am here to talk to you about my experience in taking back my time and freedom, and how you can do the same. I‚Äôve always had a beef with social media; I never really understood why it was so unimportant for people to post what they do in their daily life. I was never one for social media, so getting rid of it was relatively easy. I uninstalled TikTok when it was initially going to be banned, and then literally got unbanned the next day, and then I set a 10-minute timer for Instagram and Snapchat. The only reason why I kept Instagram and Snapchat is because, unfortunately, it‚Äôs how most of my friends communicate. And let me tell you, getting rid of TikTok was genuinely life-changing.

	At the peak of me being chronically online I was going to bed at around 12-1 am and waking up feeling groggy and crappy at 7:30 am. I constantly needed a fix for short-term content when I was bored; if I was sitting still for more than 3 seconds, I needed my phone. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt survive without social media; I thought it was genuinely a part of my life. And yet, here I am. I began this experiment 74 days ago on February 14th because of Valentine's Day posts that made me distraught. I discovered that that was the issue, letting a few Instagram stories ruin my night. So, now that that‚Äôs out of the way, I wanna talk about some of the upsides I‚Äôve experienced with this new cleanse. With basically nothing left to do on my phone, I have been going to bed at 8 pm and waking up at 5 am to get the gym done early, go straight to school, go to work after school, and then, when I was off, it‚Äôd be time for bed. Now, of course, I didn‚Äôt always go to bed at 8 pm because sometimes I was out late with my friends, just had to work late, or had a lot of homework. But that‚Äôs what I wanna get at briefly, is that there is a *big* difference between being up late for one of those things, than being up late to doom scroll on TikTok. All of those things I listed are important to my day-to-day life and shouldn‚Äôt be discouraged.¬†

	I‚Äôm saying this because what I noticed is that most of the screentime comes from before bed. Most of us need our fix of our phones before we doze off. Just 10 minutes‚Ä¶then 10 minutes becomes 30‚Ä¶then 30 becomes an hour‚Ä¶next thing you know, it‚Äôs been 3 hours and it‚Äôs 1 am. Now, it only spirals from here.¬† Light from screens signals your brain to stay awake, and that constant input throughout the day can make it difficult to go to bed at night. Because of increased time at night aswell, your brain is gonna crave more dopamine at that time and expect it. We slowly condition our brains to need the doom scrolling before bed, and we, for some reason, excuse it. Doom scrolling at night can also lead to headaches and sore eyes because looking at screens can cause fatigue or discomfort in your eyes as well as dimmed vision. Glare on screens and the brightness of the display can place further strain on your eyes, eventually leading to headaches. It‚Äôs also going to result in constant drowsiness and feeling tired all day. It‚Äôs also going to sneak another habit in there that not a lot of people talk about.

	Addictive behaviors. Addictive behaviors can vary; they can be gaming, gambling, shoplifting, dieting, exercise, case in point, anything can become an addictive behavior. However, I find that phones are the easiest to get addicted to due to their accessibility and unlimited apps, social media, games, and much more. However, I find that one addiction usually coincides with social media, which is also sneaky. Which is our lovely go-go juice caffeineation. Many of us don‚Äôt even know we pair our screen time with coffee, Dutch Bros., or energy drinks to try and stop feeling tired or fatigued, creating a toxic loop. We scroll our feeds while drinking our caffeine, getting hit by a euphoric high from the caffeine as it kickstarts our entire body, while our social media gives our brain an early dose of dopamine. This coincides later at night when we find ourselves feeling even more wired and restless. Then, in our attempts to mitigate what should have been a good night‚Äôs sleep, we use our phone more before we go to bed, and then we end up increasing our caffeine intake the next day to stay awake. This is quite literally a symbiotic reinforcing relationship. It‚Äôs symbiotic because of the mutual dependency, as social media and caffeine both create a stimulated environment. The increased stimulation and behavioral conditioning, because the combination allows you to feel an increased sociability and a sense of false productivity. However. The more we rely on our devices and caffeine, the more we crave stimulation, leading to a situation where we‚Äôre over-stimulated and under-rested. It‚Äôs no wonder that students often report anxiety and burnout. It‚Äôs become an all-too-common refrain: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just too tired,‚Äù yet the very habits we cultivate are contributing to our exhaustion.

Here is how our trip actually went...it was perfect and I wanted to share for anyone else's planning purposes <3

**Monday:**¬†We stayed at Fairmont Orchid and he golfed all day while I read all day. We had dinner on the water at the resort and just relaxed from traveling.

**Tuesday:**¬†Day 2 at the Fairmont, I got a bike and rode up and down the coast (my favorite activity), did a yoga class at the resort, he golfed, and we had amazing food at the resort and champagne sent to our room. These two days recharged both of us and we were ready to start hikin!!

**Wednesday:**¬†We drove down to the airport and got a rental car and drove to Hawi to skydive. Our skydiving was moved to Thursday due to wind, but we made the most of our already planned drive to Hilo by stopping in Hawi for brunch, and driving towards¬†**Waipio Valley**¬†for the lookout. We stopped at¬†**Waipi'o Fruit Shack**¬†for lemonade, fresh fruit, and played games there (so fun!), and drove back through Waimea for amazing ranch/country views and out through 250 for the best views ever. On the drive, we stopped at¬†**Akaka Falls**¬†for the 30 minute walk, and then¬†**Rainbow Falls**¬†as we pulled into Hilo. We checked into our hotel in Hilo, had welcome drinks, and then dinner at the hotel which was incredibly good surprisingly (so good we went back again Friday)

**Thursday:**¬†We drove back to Hawi for skydiving (WORTH IT!!!), then drove to¬†**Polulu Valley**¬†for the most incredible hike down onto a black sand beach. On the way back, we did a¬†**chocolate farm tour** that we ‚Ä¶would absolutely not recommend lol (message me if you want the name) We went to¬†**Hawaiian Style Cafe**¬†for dinner and MY GOSH! I will dream about the poke nachos for the rest of my life.

**Friday:**¬†MUST DO: We had breakfast at¬†**Ken‚Äôs Pancake House.**¬†Incredible. We then went to¬†**Volcanos NP**¬†\- about 40 minutes away - and hiked across the crater, through the lava tube, hung out in the Volcano House, and drove Chain of Craters Road West to get as close to the volcano as we could! We then drove to the 8 minutes to¬†**Volcano Winery**¬†and WOW!!! This was SO fun, they did 7 pours for $20 (?!??!)¬†

**Saturday:**¬†We were ready to relax!! We went to¬†**Verna‚Äôs Drive In**¬†for breakfast (the SHORT stack of French toast was 6 pieces!!) The people were so gosh dang kind and were excited to see us again the next day lol. We picked up snacks, beach towels, and drove to¬†**Carlsmith Beach Park**¬†and got an awesome spot by the water and literally laid here ALL day swimming with sea turtles!! It was BEAUTIFUL! We had a reservation at¬†**Hilo Bay Cafe**, grabbed a happy hour drink before this, and wow it did not disappoint.¬†

**Sunday:**¬†This was Easter Sunday, we grabbed amazing coffee, went back to¬†**Verna‚Äôs**¬†and then to an Easter service. After church, we visited¬†**Big Island Candies**¬†for gifts for everyone back at home, and strolled around¬†**Coconut Island**, watching people jump! We laid on the beach until dinner at¬†**WSW**, where we paid $89 each for an unlimited Hawaiian seafood buffet which was also so good and I think my boyfriend nearly ate them out of business in crab legs. After dinner, we put on PJs and drove to¬†**Mauna Kea**¬†\- only about 40 minutes away - and saw every star in the sky.

**Monday**: This was a great day :) We went to¬†**Hawaiian Style Cafe Hilo**¬†for incredible breakfast and mimosas, still blown away by¬†**Mauna Kea**, we drove back on the way to Kona to admire the view above the clouds, then drove to Kona, stopping at an ABC store for treats for our families, going to¬†**Ali‚Äôi Saltwater Swimming Pool**, then to¬†**Magic Sands Beach Park**¬†for the rest of the day. We picnicked here, having so much fun watching local kids surf on boogie boards (?? wild), then we went to¬†**On the Rocks**¬†for drinks and dinner OVER the water, with live music and dancing (I cried lots of happy tears here). Lastly, we grabbed some ice cream in Kona, and headed to our red eye flight.

**Takeaway**: This was the perfect trip mix of relaxing and running around. I am an outdoors girl, and we didn‚Äôt feel the need to fly so far for nightlife, so the Big Island was just perfect. I had been to the Big Island before and stayed in Waimea, so I wanted to explore Hilo this time. My gosh, we both left so enamored with Hilo. The people are so kind, the FOOD IS INCREDIBLE, and we were there during the beginning of the Merrie Monarch, which was so special.

I know I'll look like an idiot -- ~~trust me, I know!~~ \-- but after posting it on another subreddit and seeing how many people could relate to what I went through, I thought, what's one more ruined subreddit reputation? **FAIR WARNING**: This is a very long post. I promise there's a lesson here somewhere, or maybe just a vent, I don't know. Please be nice because this is me being so very vulnerable in sharing this again but I'm thinking that since I played nonchalant for 2 years, I haven't let myself snap or look as crazy as this guy painted me out to be, and since then I buried the rage. I don't want to do that anymore.

**TLDR**: After I got hot, this older, mediocre man from work stole my energy

I don't think this post is going to be like, fantastically out there or anything, but I'm still going to say now that what I'm writing (to the best of my ability) is 100% what I recollect to be the truth, and the only reason I'm writing it here is because I don't want the red pill men of reddit to find it and blow it up, or worse, people from my work sphere to find it. I've been a long time sub lurker here (even posted a few times but I deleted) and this is the only place I want to share my experience.

Under another account I mentioned to some INFP-ers in this sub, that I once ""dated"" a man that I am now convinced will someday be on a podcast or a documentary for not a good reason. I can be kind of overdramatic and maybe this post will highlight it, but for the most part, it's been like 2 years and I'm still filled with so much rage that I have to let it out here so I can move on from the rage for my own sake.

I am a very serious, very quiet person on the outside, but on the inside, I'm really quite ""girlish"" and like childish things. I'm a dreamer. I never dated before my glow up, honestly I haven't even dated that much now, but before my reference for dating was not far off from manga and dramas and movies and tiktok horror stories.

Well until about two years ago I was also very obese. Like, more obese than childhood. Nursing school does that to a girl and I lost the weight the next year while I was studying for the NCLEX, and by time I became an RN, I was at a healthy-ish BMI (not underweight, just slightly above normal weight, but I'm tall and my proportions made me look good.). Honestly, I didn't see much of a difference imo, maybe it was the dysmorphia, but everyone around me said I lost weight & looked ""healthy"" although I did not exactly do it well, which I regret to this day.

So anyway, I get skinnier and accept my first nursing job at this facility, and in orientation, some guy I thought was like 40 because of his gigantic patch of gray/white hair was in my ""class"". He was the tallest guy there and I was a little superficial back then because I immediately categorized everyone by looks, and I found him to be unfortunate looking with an ugly nose but at least he was tall and that was the only redeeming quality about him. To this day, I stand by that assumption and I also want to add: Looks aren't everything but don't actively pick the ugly men. They get an ego. They really do. Attraction is for a reason.

Anyway, I was the youngest girl in my class, most of the guys were way older, and he especially I thought was 40+ because of the chunk of white hair growing out of his white scalp that I treated him with the respect I would give an older coworker no matter our job positions even though he had a year on me experience-wise, but still, from my posts you can find me saying that I'm Asian & that's just how it is in my culture. Treat your elders with respect. So from the get-go, I didn't really see him as a potential date or anything, and I don't think anyone at work at that time would have either, unless you're as dumb as I was.

Since he was like 40+ in my eyes, I didn't think anything was wrong with the way that he would sometimes stare at me while I was interacting with my patients. I didn't even get¬†*flirtatious, I want you*¬†vibes from the stares, actually it felt like weirdly intent stares, but maybe he was just observing how I was working.

During that orientation, I thought it was so weird that all of a sudden, after years of being uncomfortable in my own body, here I was being applauded for my skill set for a beginner & professionalism. Maybe it was because I was prettier, but I can't agree that it was just that, my work style just clicked with this facility. I promise this part is important. I went above and beyond, I made my own template for my nursing assessments like my mother does (she's an NP), and I kept my own notes with me. The clerk in our unit liked my assessment so much she asked to make a copy for it, the other night shift nurses started using it, and it was kind of just like, my thing, although I know it's not a new thing, I feel like this is an important detail to add.

Well, the guy who was 40+ asked me to send him a copy of some work notes, a nursing cheat sheet that was making its rounds around our orientation group, post-orientation. Naively I say sure! And that's how he got my number. I have only ever texted him first once, and it was to ask when we were expected to get paid (or something to that effect). He gave me the answer, and then he hits me with ""I want to here about your days (he was night shift, I was day shift). Would you wanna grab a coffee and you can tell me all about your experience?""

Girls, I have never been asked out seriously before until that moment. And to say I was caught off guard was an understatement -- he was like 40, right?? But then I started thinking, oh wait a minute, it doesn't make sense that he's like 40. Maybe 35+ (I was 25 then) because he has sort of a young voice after all, and he doesn't really seem to be that confident to be honest, not the way most older people do, more like someone who just stood back and waited for things to be done. Anyway, because I was a naive romantic I agreed, because you know what! My parents met at work! And I've always told my friends I don't want to date someone immature, so maybe this was finally my time, after watching everyone around me get coupled up with their schedules filled with dates, I thought, this could be it. So yes, I went, and I wish I never did. Also, he wasn't 40 as I thought, but just a really bad 31.

This post would get pathetically long (more than it is now) if I dove into every detail of that really stupid, really flat situationship, but this is how it began: he was flooding me with attention and praise and constant texts ""how was your day?"" ""you looked so pretty today"" ""\*picture of a coffee after our coffee date and a bashful emoji\*"".¬†**The one thing I had asked from him was to please keep whatever this was as a secret because I didn't want everyone at work knowing my business.**¬†Besides being rather reserved, I'm also a hugely private person (hence the multiple reddit accounts even though I'm out and about ranting here now) and it would be a nightmare for me to have rumors behind my back. I'm used to staying out of the way, I want it to be that way at work. On our first date,¬†**I told him I wanted to do travel nursing in a few months, he told me he liked the templates I made at work**, he said it looked like I was a natural at nursing, and we ended up talking for 6 hours straight -- girls, do not do what I did. Long dates are not always a good sign, as I've learned, although they should be, they are not good signs for the wrong kind of men. The wrong kind of men want the thrill of the chase and then to move on to the next. The right kind won't waste your time & genuinely like your company.

Something else he told me -- he said that between me and him, the one most likely to be hung up on the other would be him, and that I would be the type to move on first and forget about him.

**How it ended:**¬†even though I never texted him first, he was constantly reaching out, and all my friends said that was a good sign (I should really get into this in a separate post about those kinds of friends) and to keep entertaining it. I couldn't ignore my gut feeling though, and with Valentine's Day approaching, the idea of sitting with the anxiety of ""does he still like me?"" on a holiday like that was worse than being single, which of course I was since we hadn't defined anything yet, but like, that was my issue. We were going out and talking every day, why was he not pushing to be defined? Was he really content being in this limbo? I didn't know much about dating but I don't think that's how a guy acts when he really likes you.

And then there was the issue that he would hint to me that he wants to hang out, and I would say sure, and he would want¬†*me*¬†to come up with an idea, which not only shook me to my core as a female because why would I plan?? when you initiated?? but on the other hand it also made me think, I mean, it is the modern times, maybe I'm being too traditional and conservative in my thinking.

Boy was I wrong. I was getting a lot of anxiety because he wasn't complimenting me as much and also I couldn't help but notice he rarely ever called our dates ""a date"" except for one time where we were sitting in a broke fast food place and he offered to give me the hat he was wearing and then took it back literally in the same conversation (yes it is that sad).

SO, two days before that holiday, I asked him to tell me how he really feels, and no surprise, he hits me with the lame excuse of ""so I just bought a house and¬†**I'm applying for travel nursing jobs**"", ""I want to focus on making money right now and I could be leaving in a week or so"", ""it's not fair to you and it's so early I don't want us to be long distance, I do like you.""

GUYS. LIKE AN IDIOT, I BOUGHT IT. Because you know why? The first words out of his mouth were about honesty and trust, and in hindsight, he never said he would honor honesty and trust, just that he expected it. LMAO. And the travel nursing thing, I mean, it's not a far off dream for all registered nurses, I thought at the time, okay, weird timing but it's a common dream. I understand.

Okay I keep typing too long, anyway: I was so unbelievably sad but please believe me when I say I didn't let it show at work. I kept my feelings to myself, I gave report as usual, I acted the way I always had. I actually started thriving at work like that Taylor Swift song because even if I was going to be alone forever, at least I had my career right? But inside, I was hurting so bad, it was the first quasi-relationship I had been in since high school, so I think that's why it hit me so hard to have high hopes. BUT STILL, I didn't do anything crazy, I would own up to it if I did! And this is me owning up to something I'd consider bad but not crazy: One of the young nurses, my mentor, caught me in a vulnerable moment while I was trying to keep it in, and I told her a snippet of what was going on. A snippet. She turned out to be bipolar & on a manic phase (she was forced to resign for something unrelated about a few weeks after, i wish this was a lie, but this really happened) and that was the second mistake I made.

While I was sad on the inside, I couldn't help but notice he was not only doing fine emotionally while continuing to lead me on after sending the message that he wanted to continue talking¬†***as friends,***¬†he was doing better at work. A lot of the things he was doing, he had copied from me. He walked around with his own template (which isn't a big deal, but he literally said he liked mine a lot and the next day he had his own and he didn't even show it to me, I saw it myself and he explained very quickly that he did it too). He was telling me the rationale of his decisions, some of which were words that literally came out of my own mouth just before. Word for word he used what I said about a past patient for a new patient, I don't want to break hipaa, it was a very unique description/suggestion for an intervention, and he looked so proud as if he was the first one to come up with it. Not only that, but I think I even recall a time he was using my jokes & repeating the things I had said, to other people while I was still in the unit. MY JOKES. Take my template, but seriously?? My punch lines? To make your goofy friends laugh??

Worst of all, apparently, he told those people an inflated version of what went on between us, which, although I was sad that ""it"" ended, even I recognized that ""it"" was not even real, because we never defined anything. While I was sad, it didn't mean I was obsessed, it meant I had feelings but I knew how to act like an adult. He made himself look cool to his night shift rat friends that even the younger girls on his time, also around my age, started going out with him. By the time I heard about it I didn't really care, I just wondered if they would have started going out with him if I never gave him the time of day, you know what I mean? Like the only reason I can think of why he would brag about ""talking"" with me, was so he could be the guy at work who was talking to the reserved girl at work who didn't mess around with anyone else. But I don't know, I can't read minds, I'm just self aware. Because why else were all of his friends suddenly coming up to me saying so?

It was a night shift girl who told me what he was saying. She literally came jogging up to me in the med room and goes ""Wait so did you and X really have a thing?? Because he told everyone you were kind of clingy and wouldn't stop texting him"", ""that you guys basically had a relationship and he had to break up with you because of it"". To say I was floored was an understatement. I very calmly said we had talked in the past but decided we were better as friends and I was the one who initiated that conversation. I also mentioned that he was the one who wanted me to give night shift a chance, to be on his team, even after he wanted to """"break up"""". I recognized that he was leading me on at that point, but I still had so much hope & my friends were saying that they thought he was 'changing his mind' wifjehkrj get better friends than mine please.

And then it was one of his night shift guy friends who hinted something similar. Made a face like it was funny and hilarious. All of the other night shift employees, the young guys that I stayed away from because I heard stories about them, were also acting a certain way towards me. At work, I'm supposed to be delegating to them. It was almost mortifying, except I'm educated and I'm going to stand by that.

And the bipolar nurse? She also started spreading an inflated, but delusion-fueled account of what I said, until it was completely unrecognizable. What I said was that he changed his mind about me, she told people a story in which he stood me up on a date, then proceeded to start going off at his night shift friend. It did wonders for my reputation! People say that it was part of her bipolar manic episode, but I don't know if it was. I think, because she told me so, that since she was going through something similar but a little worse than my situation, she didn't want to be alone in it. She was pushing me to reach out and text him first, but I'm very stubborn and I wouldn't let myself look like an idiot again. I said no, and she decided to instigate a fight on my behalf for me. Misery likes what?

Anyway, he ended up quitting work with another bogus excuse, and that's it. He flipped the script, made me look like the hung-up idiot in the end to his friends when he was the one who asked me out first. Walked around with my template and my jokes and my rationales. This felt great to get off my chest, I really don't want the red pill men to find it, but yeah. While you do the glowing up physically, do the glow up internally too. Otherwise you're just jumping in the dating pool without the skills to swim, not even a floatie.

I've dated since then but I've not been as trusting. At the first red flag, I cut off immediately, maybe too soon, but I don't even take my friends' advice anymore, I just go off my instincts. If you read this far, you're a riot.

Editing to add because I forgot lol: Honestly, I don't blame the rest of my night shift coworkers for their ideas about me after that incident. You hear one thing from one of the primary sources, no matter how corny, and then you hear something else from another nurse who happens to be in my shift, what would you believe? I would have believed the same thing they did. I just did my work and proved the rumors wrong and no one on day shift believed the rumors I think because they saw how I was first hand?

But on the last day before I left to do travel nursing, guess what... my house supervisor takes me aside and says, by the way, don't date anyone from work again :-) Apparently she had gone through a similar situation as I did, during her first year as a nurse too, but she was also my clinical professor before being my house supervisor so she knew how I was as a person.

Guys, that was literally my nightmare though. I don't even tell my parents what's going on with me. People at work knew things that my parents didn't. For an introvert, it's a nightmare. That was the first and last time I ever went out with anyone from work again, the guys after have been from different fields & financially stable, although I'm still not really feeling it now, I know it'll work out.",3,1745516667.0,infp,0,1.0,False

1k6yejq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k6yejq/grinding_coarser_made_shot_less_sour_gcp/,Grinding coarser made shot less sour? [GCP],"**TLDR**: If I go too fine and pull a 1:3 shot in 35-45 seconds, it's crazy sour. If I grind coarser it's less sour. What physically is causing that?

**For context**: using an unmodded Gaggia Classic Pro, DF64v 2, and a light roast coffee (Hex Coffee; if you've gotten from them before, they tend to roast everything to a similar level). Following [Lance Hedricks's temperature surfing technique ](https://youtu.be/qz7PPnPSFd0?feature=shared&t=208)but I'm sure there is still variance. Using a 16g basket and a puck screen, never have issues with a watery puck though, doubt the basket is relevant but might as well include it.

I tend to do 1:3 ratios for lighter roasts at home. I started with 15g in, 45g out with my grinder set to 7. I'm going to just use the numbers on the grinder but I don't think they really mean anything, helpful for reference though. Also, using the 1200 variable speed for everything but I don't think that's too important. So here's how my dialing in went, from memory:

1. Grind size: 7; 15g -> chocked
2. Grind size: 7; 14.5g -> chocked
3. Grind size: 7; 14g -> 42g in \~45s (very sour)
4. Grind size: 8; 14g -> 42g in \~40s (just as sour)
5. Grind size: 10; 14g -> 42g in \~30s (decent, just a bit sour)

I tried some other recipes along the way but these are the ones I think are relevant. I do recognize that starting fine and going coarser isn't the best option, I promise I commit far worse sins when dialing in lmao. I did not see any obvious signs of channeling in the pucks but that doesn't mean there was none. I've also been able to reproduce these shots (for better or worse) so I don't expect it to be variance in the machine. Of course, if that's the only explanation I'll accept.

My question is less about helping dialing in and more about understanding the mechanics. What makes my finer 45 second shot more sour than my coarser 30 second shot? I can assume it's ""just better extraction"" but what physically is causing the difference? I would think the finer shot would be less sour since it would have higher levels of extraction. And if there is channeling from it being so fine, I would think those areas would be over extracted and make the shot more bitter if anything.

I've noticed this when I was dialing in a shot with my J-Ultra hand grinder. I started finer than I should, backed off so it doesn't choke -> it's too sour. Back off more -> more reasonable shot time and less sour. I know [Lance Hedrick talked about what he calls the extraction ""quantum realm""](https://www.youtube.com/live/CT60oH3TfAM?feature=shared&t=370) where after a curtain fine-ess there's no telling what going to happen. Is that basically what's happening? If so, what would cause it to get more acidic?

Hope some people find this interesting, I know it's a lot of info for a simple question haha. I usually enjoy posts here with way too much detail so thought others might as well. Bonus points if you have an articles where I can read up on what's happening and feel free to sprinkle in extra extraction theory since I'm new to it. Thanks!",1,1745516523.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Review Insights!,"The High Tech Pet PX2-WIFI Power Pet Electronic Dog Door has been an intriguing product to test over these past weeks. With its WiFi-enabled functionality paired with a smartphone app and ultrasonic collar, it promises a futuristic way to manage pet access and security. Designed for larger dogs of up to 100 lbs, this door seemed like the perfect fit for my family‚Äôs lively Labrador, Max. While it delivered on several fronts, some concerns arose during this hands-on experience.

**Ease of Installation**

At first glance, the installation process appeared straightforward, but the large frame and 40-pound weight made it a challenge for one person to handle. It took a bit of manual dexterity and an extra set of hands to mount it securely. The build is primarily plastic, which doesn‚Äôt exactly speak ‚Äúpremium,‚Äù but it‚Äôs sturdy enough for most indoor or sheltered installations. If you‚Äôre like me and not naturally inclined toward DIY projects, you might want to keep a drill and a motivator (like coffee or your pet giving you guilty eyes) handy.

**Intuitive App Integration**

What won me over initially was the smartphone app that comes with this electronic pet door. The ability to control the door remotely from anywhere added a modern twist to traditional pet doors. You can set four-way access options‚Äîa feature that lets the pet in, out, both ways, or keeps it locked altogether. It even logs activity like how many times Max came in or went out in a day. But here‚Äôs where it gets quirky: those push notifications that tell me Max ‚Äúattempted to go out while the sensor was off‚Äù? Let‚Äôs just say they became ad-hoc reminders that my dog‚Äôs social life might be busier than mine.

[Check High Tech Pet PX2-WIFI price on Amazon.](https://petof.com/p/b09v9qlkgp/)

**Key Benefits**

- The door is equipped to handle pets up to 100 lbs, catering perfectly to large breeds like my Labrador.
- The vertically sliding door has a snug, airtight seal design, which is great for thermal insulation and energy savings.
- The ultrasonic collar is lightweight and compatible with other High Tech Pet Ultrasonic products.
- Unlimited timers provide customizable schedules tailored to your pet‚Äôs habits‚Äîno more late-night barking marathons!
- WiFi connectivity allows you to manage access remotely, adding convenience when you‚Äôre on the go.

**Performance & Daily Use**

The door‚Äôs responsiveness when paired with its ultrasonic collar is impressive. Max quickly learned to walk confidently to the door, triggering its vertical slide mechanism. The speed is just right‚Äînot too fast to scare pets, yet quick enough to prevent those stray leaves or bugs from sneaking in. My only gripe here is that the collar battery didn‚Äôt last as long as I expected; I had to replace it within two weeks despite relatively moderate usage. Be prepared to stock a few extra batteries.

**Drawbacks**

- The plastic frame, while functional, doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence in harsh weather conditions.
- The collar battery‚Äôs short lifespan adds an extra maintenance expense over time.
- WiFi setup was finicky during the initial connection; expect some trial and error if you‚Äôre not a tech-savvy user.
  
**Competing Brands**

In comparison to other electronic pet doors like the PetSafe Elite and SureFlap Microchip models, this product stands apart, thanks to its smartphone app and greater weight capacity. However, SureFlap excels at microchip integration, providing one less thing to charge or replace. Meanwhile, PetSafe offers a similar level of convenience but uses magnetic closure technology instead of the vertical slide mechanism. What High Tech Pet really nails is its customizable scheduling feature, which neither of the others matches in terms of flexibility and control.

**Smart Spending**

While this electronic dog door adds undeniable convenience, the price point reflects its advanced elements. Comparable products often lack the app integration or the ability to handle heavy-duty use for larger pets. Ultimately, its value hinges on how essential remote control functionality is for you. If you‚Äôre frequently away from home or have multiple pets to manage, it‚Äôs worth the investment. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre uncertain about embracing technology in pet care, other simpler and less costly options might suit your budget better.

Coming to work after the attack on Rachel was difficult. The entire atmosphere of the clinic had changed. Wilson felt horrible about being unable to protect Rachel from the crazed patient, Rachel was inconsolable after the attack on her and took to wearing a face mask to cover most of it. And Dr. Harrison wasn‚Äôt much better after I had walked in on him muttering to himself and murdering the patient who had attacked Rachel. What was strange in all of this was that Dr. Harrison continued to act as if I hadn‚Äôt seen him doing it.¬†



I know that he does these things, and I willingly choose to forget them just so I can continue to collect my paycheck and go home, but actually to see him doing it and then just going on as if nothing happened was unsettling. The next day, he came up to my desk with a big bouquet of flowers. A giant one with roses, daisies, and other flowers. I thought that they might have been for Rachel, but then he told them they were for me. And he didn‚Äôt stop. Every day since then, he‚Äôs brought me more and more flowers. Some of them with boxes of chocolates or with teddy bears, some enclosed in glass to keep them forever fresh.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to develop a pollen allergy.‚Äù I sighed as I tried to find space for his latest bouquet. I usually took them home and just left them until they wilted, or even gave them to random couples I came across on my walk home from work. But during working hours, I had to suffer with them around me. I don‚Äôt hate flowers, but this many of them were an assault on my nostrils and my eyesight from how bright and vibrant they were.¬†



After finally finding space on my desk to place this latest bouquet, I looked up and noticed Wilson staring down at me with a little pout. He looked like a big dog after he had been scolded for peeing on the carpet or something. It was always hard to remind myself that Wilson wasn‚Äôt a real person. He was some strange creation that Dr. Harrison had created to be our security guard, and could easily at any time turn into a horrible blob monster. And yet it was impossible not to love him. After our first meeting and his reformation into a human shape, he‚Äôd taken on a more Security guard-like appearance. With muscles and a taller stance, it seemed like he could change his appearance whenever he wanted.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Wilson? Are you still upset about not being able to protect Rachel?‚Äù I asked him, reaching a hand out to touch his face to comfort him. While he looked human and his skin looked like skin, once you touched it, it felt like pottery clay. I felt that if I pushed deep enough on his skin, I‚Äôd leave behind subtle impressions of my fingerprints.¬†



He nodded in response to my question and looked at me with his sad, greyish-green eyes. ‚ÄúI want to apologize to her, but she won‚Äôt talk to me.‚Äù He sighed and looked over at the flowers around me. ‚ÄúMaybe if I give her one of those?‚Äù he asked, lifting his head from my hand and looking at the flowers. ‚ÄúDo you know which ones she likes?‚Äù he asked me, carefully touching one of the roses with his hands.¬†



‚ÄúWell, I can try and ask her,‚Äù I told him, smiling as I watched him interact with the flower. It reminded me that I don't think Wilson ever left the clinic. The time when he was keeping people outside from entering was the first time I‚Äôd ever seen him leave. So I was left to wonder where exactly he would even go to get whatever flower Rachel wanted.¬†



‚ÄúThank you, Maggie,‚Äù he said with a smile, and he gently patted the rose he had been touching like it was a dog and returned to his post by the door. As if on cue, after he‚Äôd returned to his post, Rachel came through the door. Watching her walk into work now was soul-crushing. She was hunched over and shuffling like some kind of zombie or undead corpse. Like she‚Äôd lost all the will to do anything at all.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Rachel?‚Äù I called out to her. She turned her head to look at me, a face mask firmly on her face. She shuffled over to my reception desk and pulled the mask down a little. Once she did, I was able to see that the stitches that had been there for the past few days had been removed by Dr. Harrison and that now only a long and angry scar remained.¬†



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked me. Not even a comment on my weight or anything, this was serious. Her voice was defeated and beaten down. It was a miracle that she was even able to drag herself into work nowadays. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how Dr. Harrison could even be using her as his nurse.¬†



‚ÄúWell, I was just wondering what your favorite flower is. All these flowers have me in that sort of headspace.‚Äù I told her with a smile, turning on the approachable charm that usually made people open up to me. Rachel looked at me before tearing her blue eyes off of me to look at the flowers around me.¬†



‚ÄúWhy? Not like he‚Äôs going to bring me any.‚Äù She sighed, turning to leave my desk. I looked over at Wilson and saw that he was panicking a little. I had to think of something quick.¬†



‚ÄúHe actually is. He just doesn‚Äôt know what flowers you enjoy, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù I figured that even if she didn‚Äôt fully believe me, if there was even a chance of Dr. Harrison giving her some flowers, she‚Äôd at least tell me. She stopped and looked back at me. She didn‚Äôt believe me, but finally she shrugged her shoulders.¬†



‚ÄúWhite lilies.‚Äù Was her response before she left to join Dr. Harrison in the back of the clinic to begin work. I looked over at Wilson and gave him a thumbs-up. He gave me one, and I could tell he was happy with the outcome. The rest of the day continued as it usually did. Wilson took special care with the patients now, and even before any of them thought of laying a hand on me, they had Wilson practically breathing down their neck.¬†



Once lunch finally rolled around, I stretched in my chair and let out a soft yawn. The rush had died down, and as such, it was the perfect opportunity for me to go and get lunch. Standing up from my chair, I was about to go and tell Dr. Harrison that I was going to go to lunch. As I turned around, however, he was already standing behind me with a big tooth grin on his face.¬†



‚ÄúOh! Hello, Dr. Harrison. I was just about to tell you that I was leaving.‚Äù I told him, feeling my heart leap out of my chest in shock. ‚ÄúDo you want your usual?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYes, thank you so much, Maggie.‚Äù He told me, his smile wide and his eyes shining so bright I thought I‚Äôd go blind by staring at them for too long. I shielded myself with my hand before quickly grabbing my bag from behind me. As I turned to leave, though, he asked me something. ‚ÄúAre you going to meet Philip again?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúMost likely,‚Äù I told him, Philip was always working around this time, so it would be logical that I would see him again. I thought back to walking in on Dr. Harrison murdering the patient so violently and listening to his mutterings as he did so. He‚Äôd gotten upset upon learning that Philip and I enjoyed flirting with each other. ‚ÄúIs that a problem, sir?‚Äù I asked him.¬†



‚ÄúNo, not at all,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI was simply wondering, was all.‚Äù He laughed it off, his eye twitching like crazy as he did so. ‚ÄúEnjoy your lunch, Maggie!‚Äù He waved me goodbye as I left the reception area. Why did he care so much? We weren‚Äôt dating. I was practically forced to work here with him because he couldn‚Äôt handle me quitting on him. So why was he making such a big deal over me flirting with someone?¬†



I waited in my car for a moment, my eyes firmly towards the clinic, wondering if Dr. Harrison was staring back at me from behind one of the windows. After a few more minutes, I started up my car and drove to the coffee shop. Arriving there and entering the shop, I was immediately calmed by the smell of the freshly ground coffee and the lovely classical music that the shop played over its loudspeakers.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Mags,‚Äù Philip said with a smile as I approached the counter. He was already getting my order ready. I smiled back at him and started to fish through my bag for my wallet. And then I noticed that my wallet was missing. I started to panic slightly. Had I dropped it at the office? Or on the way here? But when I felt bread crumbs at the bottom of my purse again, I let out a deep and annoyed sigh. I had to stop leaving my bag on the floor.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Phil. I left my wallet at the clinic.‚Äù I told him, turning to go and exit the shop. I figured I was going to have to hurry back and try and bargain my wallet back from the lost and found bread thief.¬†



‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry about that. This one's on the house.‚Äù He told me, still making my latte and smiling at me. I stopped and turned to look at him. ‚ÄúJust keep this between me and you.‚Äù He said with a wink and a smile as he turned to pour Dr. Harrison‚Äôs cup of black coffee. I smiled and walked back over to the counter, noticing that, for once, there was a muffin available among the options of pastries.¬†



‚ÄúCan you also spot me that muffin? I never get to have one of those.‚Äù I pointed to the muffin that was tantalizingly sitting in the display case. Philip nodded and placed my drinks on the counter, before picking up his tongs and getting the muffin for me, and placing it in the bag. ‚ÄúThank you so much, Phil. I owe you one.‚Äù I told him as I took my order from him.¬†



‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind going to lunch sometime with you,‚Äù he told me as he leaned on the counter and smiled at me. I looked at him and felt my face get warmer. This was the first time a guy had ever asked me to go on a date with him. I thought back to what Dr. Harrison had asked me and what I had seen him doing to a patient. But this is my life, and I make the decisions.¬†



‚ÄúI would love to, Philip,‚Äù I told him with a smile. Turning to leave, I was suddenly scared out of my shoes upon seeing Dr. Harrison standing outside the window of the coffee shop with his face pressed against the glass. The anger on his face was palpable, and I was worried that he‚Äôd break the glass with how hard he had his hands pressed against the glass. I quickly hurried outside of the shop and over to him.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?!‚Äù I asked him, pushing him away from the glass before Philip could notice him glaring into the coffee shop. ‚ÄúYou have a surgery you‚Äôre supposed to be doing!‚Äù He stared at me with rage in his eyes as he looked down on me.¬†



‚ÄúIs that him?‚Äù he asked, motioning towards the coffee shop. ‚ÄúWhat did he say to you?‚Äù He narrowed his eyes at me, and they began to shine brightly, and my head began to throb. He was trying to control me again. I shook my head and quickly shoved his drink into his chest, hoping that some of the scalding liquid would spill on him,¬†



‚ÄúNo, he doesn‚Äôt work today.‚Äù I lied to him, hoping to protect Philip. And glad that this time he hadn‚Äôt written on either of the cups. ‚ÄúAnd even if it was, why would you care if it was?‚Äù He took the coffee from me and stared at me.¬†



‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre mine! You belong to me, Maggie!‚Äù he shouted. I looked back at the coffee shop and was glad that Philip was helping another customer. I scoffed at Dr. Harrison, wishing that both of my hands weren‚Äôt preoccupied with holding things so that I could smack him.¬†



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong to you, James! Just because I agreed to continue working for you, does not mean that I belong to you.‚Äù I turned to leave, and as I did, I felt him reach out a grab my arm. He dug his nails into my soft skin, and I let out a pained yelp. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt let go of me, I swear to God I‚Äôll call Mr. Sinclair,‚Äù I warned him. That got him to let go of me quickly. I didn‚Äôt bother turning around to look at him and just continued back to my car. I sat in it and slammed the door shut behind me.¬†



I didn‚Äôt want to go back to work, in fact, those same thoughts of quitting bubbled back to the surface. But one thing is keeping me working here. The money. And not because of how well it pays. The reason I‚Äôm staying for the money is to help my parents. My dad was in a car accident that left him quadriplegic and sent my parents into a spiraling amount of medical debt. I send them a vast majority of the money I earn from this hellhole. And for my family, I‚Äôll do anything, even deal with Dr. Harrison.¬†



So after reminding myself of why I‚Äôm doing this in the first place, I started the drive back to the clinic. Arriving back at the clinic and finding it functioning normally, I sat back at my reception desk and quickly found my wallet on the floor. Looking through it, I was glad to see that everything was there. The bread creature must‚Äôve been disappointed not to find anything shiny and had abandoned it. Dr. Harrison arrived soon after I got situated and wordlessly walked past me back to the surgery he‚Äôd abandoned.¬†

¬†

The rest of the day went by as normal. I finished the paperwork I had to do and looked over at Wilson, who smiled back at me and waved. I waved back at him and filed away the last of my paperwork. I looked up at the schedule and saw that Dr. Harrison and Rachel would be doing a facial reconstruction. Those usually took the rest of the day, and since closing time was quickly approaching, I decided to just head home early. The less time I had around Dr. Harrison, the better.¬†



I said goodbye to Wilson and went off to the parking lot, making sure that the bread creature hadn‚Äôt taken anything from my purse or my person. Once I confirmed that I had everything, I sat in my car and lay back in my chair. Just as I was about to leave and start my car, I heard my ringtone. I groaned, anticipating that it was probably Dr. Harrison again. But to my immense relief and joy, I saw that it was my mom calling me.¬†



‚ÄúHi, Momma!‚Äù I answered excitedly. I have always had a very close relationship with my parents and my mom in particular. I confided almost everything to her, except, of course, what was happening at the clinic, and she did the same with me.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Maggie! I just called to check on you, and to thank you again for helping out with your dad.‚Äù She sounded tired. It made sense, as she was my dad‚Äôs full-time caretaker now. But mom never complained about it, since she loved my dad more than anything on Earth.¬†



‚ÄúOf course, Momma. It was never an option not to help you guys out.‚Äù I told her as I placed my phone on the dashboard mount and started the car up. ‚ÄúSo you received that payment I sent?‚Äù I asked her, pulling out of the parking lot and starting on the route home.¬†



‚ÄúWe did! Thanks to you, we won‚Äôt have to decide between your dad‚Äôs therapy or eating.‚Äù She sounded like she was joking, but I knew full well that their finances were that bad. My parents never wanted me to worry about them, even after my dad‚Äôs accident, but I could tell just how deep in debt they were. From bills past due and in collections, to the fact that I had to stop people from repossessing their car. They‚Äôre stubborn and seldom ask for help even when they so desperately need it.¬†



‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt joke like that, Momma. Otherwise, I‚Äôm gonna end my lease and move back in to help you guys.‚Äù I warned her, which quickly got her to apologize. We talked as I drove back to my apartment. As I was walking to my mailbox and inserting the key to open it, still talking with her, I noticed that the lock had been broken on it.¬†



‚ÄúMaggie? Did you hear what I said, sweetheart?‚Äù My mom asked as I opened my mail locker and saw that someone had gone through it. Letters were opened and their contents were spilled out. Someone had gone through my mail.¬†



‚ÄúLet me call you back, Momma. I love you.‚Äù I blew her some kisses from my end and received some from her end. Hanging up on her and placing my phone back in my purse, I quickly grabbed the letters and started looking through them. Most of them were just bills and junk mail, and I was glad that my bank hadn‚Äôt sent me anything that day.¬†



I grabbed all my open mail and closed my mailbox, determined to call my landlord, and if he didn‚Äôt answer, then the police. I don‚Äôt live in the nicest apartment complex but this was the first time that someone had gone through my mail, and it pissed me off. Walking up to my apartment and inserting the key into the lock, my heart froze in my chest when I saw that it wasn‚Äôt locked. And even worse, the door simply pushed open when I tested to see if the door was truly locked.¬†



Someone had been in my house. Without even thinking, I quickly entered it and pulled the pepper spray out of my bag. I only had one thing on my mind, barging into an apartment that might still have had an intruder in it. My dog.¬†



‚ÄúSonny?!‚Äù I called out to him, worried sick and praying that nothing had happened to him. And to my immense relief, my little corgi came waddling out to greet me in the pink sweater that I had knitted for him. ‚ÄúOh, thank God.‚Äù I sighed, getting on my knees to scoop him up into my arms. He seemed perfectly fine and unaffected by whatever stranger had broken into my home. That wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise, unfortunately, as Sonny is the friendliest dog ever and makes for a terrible guard dog.¬†



As I examined my apartment, Sonny and pepper spray held firmly in both of my arms, it became apparent that nothing had been stolen. I didn‚Äôt exactly have many valuables, besides the many pictures of me and my family. After ensuring that nobody was there, I placed Sonny back on the floor and went about getting him and myself some food.¬†



After I poured out his food and refilled his water, I walked over to the fridge and opened it. I then let out a scream and quickly slammed it closed. I covered my mouth and ran to the toilet to quickly vomit up my lunch. After I had finished and washed my mouth out, I stared back at the fridge. I walked over to it and opened it again.¬†



There in the middle of my fridge were two bleeding masses of flesh left behind in my fridge. Along with that was an envelope leaning against them. I reached out and quickly took the envelope, thankful that I grabbed a corner with no blood on it. I opened the card and quickly read it.¬†



‚ÄúYou leave me breathless.‚Äù I stared at the card and then at my fridge. It was very clear what those two organs were. And even clearer who had sent them. I crumpled the card angrily in my hands and tossed it to the ground. Dr. James Harrison had messed with the wrong girl.¬†

First of all, I know nothing about cars and english is not my first language - so apologies if anything is written in a weird way!

The problem is stated on the title - oil in coolant and to my understanding, coolant in oil. (I‚Äôll add pictures and video which is from the ‚Äôcoolant box‚Äô). Checked by a person who knows what they are talking about.

Info about car: Audi a3, driven for 278 xxx thousand kilometers. 1.6l motor, automatic, petrol. Maintenanced and checked. No overheating.

The problem it had beforehand was that it was eating a LOT of oil, but I was told it‚Äôs fine as it has been doing that for ages. So I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Drove to my friends house which is about 200km lenght wise. We checked the oil from the dipstick - it was under the minimum limit so went and bought more. Added about 1,5 liters and it was fine. Got told to check the coolant box - was when we noticed that something is VERY wrong. (I know the video is not great, but it shows the problem). Also under the cap of the motor, the oil appeared to have a sort of an whipped coffee look‚Ä¶? I‚Äôll add a picture to the comments.

Well, drove the car home and straight to a mechanic. I was just told if it breaks, it breaks and that‚Äôs it - if it doesn‚Äôt we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs fixable (within a price of reason). Now, the car is back and apparently all the mechanic did was just look at it. Nothing is mixed together and it‚Äôs fine. 

I would accept it, if it was only me checking it. Like sure, maybe I checked the wrong spot, or something. But there was a person who knew. So I really doubt that is the case. I just doubt that a car can just magically unfix themself‚Ä¶? I appreciate any comments, no one really seems to believe me in this case, because I don‚Äôt have a lot of knowledge about cars.",2,1745516040.0,AskMechanics,4,1.0,False

I've tried the pomodoro technique, I've hidden my phone, I've installed software to keep me from scrolling, I study in coffee shops for body-doubling, I tried body-doubling with those ""study with me"" YouTube channels, I tried listening to binaural beats and all those random playlists that say they help you focus, etc. etc. etc.

This sleek, black single-serve coffee maker promises versatility, ease, and customization ‚Äì but does it deliver? Spoiler alert: it mostly does, though not without a few quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The modern aesthetic of this coffee maker blends effortlessly into my kitchen. Its compact size, measuring 10"" x 6.3"" x 11"", ensures it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is a blessing given my tiny apartment. The 50 oz removable water tank is one of its more thoughtful additions. Filling and cleaning it is ridiculously simple, and I appreciate not having to refill the tank constantly. Though the lightweight design ‚Äì it weighs just 4.43 pounds ‚Äì makes it portable, it also means it feels less ‚Äúpremium‚Äù compared to chunkier, sturdier coffee machines.

**Usability and Interface**  
Using this machine is incredibly intuitive. The buttons make everything self-explanatory, so you aren‚Äôt fumbling around at 6 AM desperately trying to make a cup of coffee. You can brew your drink at the touch of a button and choose from five brewing capacities ranging from 6 oz to 14 oz, making it flexible for travel mugs or petite servings. The fact that it automatically turns off after 10 minutes of inactivity is a relief for forgetful people like me and saves energy ‚Äì thank you for that feature!

[Check KIDISLE KC101B price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d7yxvhlj)  

**Coffee Customization Options**  
This is where the product excels. You can choose between regular and bold brew strengths, regardless of whether you're making iced or hot coffee. Testing the bold strength, I found it held up remarkably ‚Äì no weak or watery flavors here. On a weekend, I even brewed coffee grounds instead of using a K-cup, using the included reusable filter. The result? Fresh-tasting coffee that was tailored to my liking and didn‚Äôt produce any waste, a win for sustainability.

**Performance and Speed**  
The promise of ""fast & fresh-brewed"" coffee isn't an exaggeration. This machine consistently brewed hot coffee in under three minutes and iced coffee in what felt like no time at all. It‚Äôs the perfect speed for those of us perpetually rushing out the door. However, there is a bit of trial and error involved in getting perfect iced coffee; finding the right coffee-to-ice ratio is crucial to avoid dilution.

**Benefits**  
- The brewing options cover multiple preferences, from light sips to extra-strong jolts of caffeine.  
- The removable water reservoir saves time, especially if you're entertaining guests.  
- A compact design keeps it functional yet kitchen-counter friendly.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The lightweight construction, while portable, may not feel as durable as other machines.  
- It doesn't have a milk frother, so latte enthusiasts might feel left out.  
- Producing iced coffee requires some tinkering on the user‚Äôs end to achieve the perfect brew.  

**Energy Efficiency**  
One underrated feature that became a personal favorite is its energy efficiency. The auto-off feature doesn‚Äôt just save electricity; it also lets you leave home without that gnawing worry of whether you accidentally left the coffee maker running. It‚Äôs subtle inclusions like these that make it easy for daily use.

**Product Contenders**  
This little unit stacks up against classics like the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While Keurig offers a slightly more premium feel and few more brewing options, it lacks the affordability and versatility (like iced coffee features) that this one nails. FlexBrew also has a 2-way brewing design for a full pot or single-serve but doesn‚Äôt bring the iced coffee option to the table. That said, both of these alternatives feel slightly sturdier, and I imagine they'd last longer with heavy use.  

**Quality for Price**  
Its price point is what I‚Äôd categorize as fair ‚Äì especially if you need an all-in-one coffee maker that works seamlessly for individuals or small households. The reusable filter also lowers ongoing expenses compared to always repurchasing disposable pods. It may lack the bells and whistles of costlier models, but considering its multi-functional abilities, this gadget earns its keep.

He was unfaithful to her mother during a couple of years and they divorced. Ever since, their relationship was always rocky.
Sometimes they are fine and can have a coffee just ok, other times they just can't be together without arguing.
My partner also, at times, seems to withdraw from having any relationship and avoids contacting him.

I sometimes feel she's unfair and jumps the gun too easily, but I also understand I lack some context and history between them to better understand. I tend to get judgemental of her at times but am trying to avoid that and just be supportive.

How should I proceed? I think it's fair to call her out at times, but in this case that is very hard without seeming that I'm siding with her father. To be clear, I think he's the one at fault most of the time.

I've never taken benadryl in my life. I figure how bad can it be. I take two. I then read the package: may cause marked fatigue. I usually drink strong cold brew in the morning and I also take a daily steroid inhaler for chronic asthma, which can wire me so bad that i lose sleep. You can see where this is going. The combo of the coffee and inhaler and benadryl is bad, like I can't think and my hands are floppy bad. I feel like I ate a weed gummy.

1k6xxh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1k6xxh4/breast_reduction_pt_1_diary_of_pre_and_immediate/,Breast Reduction Pt 1 | Diary of Pre and Immediate Post Op,"For context, i'm 36F and decided to have a reduction for a variety of reasons: neck and back pain (i've seen a chiro for a decade), sweat rashes, not being able to find a bra that fit for my wedding and not feeling like my body has a professional look (I don't need disagreements or platitudes, it's a feeling I have it is what it is). For additional context about my medical history - I have hypothyroidism, Hashimotos and depression - other than that i'm fairly medically healthy. 

  
1) 08/26/2024 (6 Months Pre-op) - initial consult with surgeon + beginning of waiting period for insurance (BC/BS) pre-approval. We discussed my overall goals, I asked some general questions, but didn't want to get too far into the weeds until I knew if I'd be approved.  They provided a lot of documentation on what to do pre-op and post-op as well as a lot of general literature on the surgery. 

2) 09/27/2024 (5 Months Pre-op) - Approval from insurance and surgery scheduled. 

3) 02/12/2025 (2-week Pre-Op appointment) - Surgeon and I took before pictures, discussed a lot of medication-related information and other general questions. I also received additional information about medications that i'll be taking pre- post-op and when to pick them up. Some of my questions: 

a) will I have drains? Nope

b) What types of meds or supplements should I take to help ready my body for surgery? Arnica (helps with swelling and bruising) and Valacyclovir (prevent cold sores). Stop taking all other supplements 10 days prior to surgery. No anti-inflammatory meds, turmeric or green tea. Continue taking all thyroid meds even day of. Do not take depression med day of. 

c)What will the general process of the surgery day look like for me? He walked me through signing in, general getting ready type things (IV, meds, dressing down, anesthesia meeting, etc). Then he talked me through a bit of the immediate post op procedure. 

d) What about diet pre and post op ? High protein, low sugar, moderate salt. Eat pineapple every day for at least two weeks after surgery -- it helps with the healing process. 

e) What about grooming stuff?  Every time you shower for a week pre-op use antibacterial soap and no shaving. Day of surgery - no deoderant or skin care products. Remove all jewelry, wear comfy sweats, socks if desired and bring a button up shirt that you can sleep in. 

4) Those two weeks, I followed all the pre-op suggestions. And I was super excited and worried at the same time. To help out my husband, we sat down and made a list of things that would be helpful since he was going to be running the house alone. We got disposable plates, bowls and utensils; meal prepped a bunch of freezer meals; set up a bed in the office for me to sleep separate from our dogs; and did a big costco run for fresh eating and snacks. 

5) 02/24/25 - (1-day pre-Op) I put on a scopolamine patch to help with the nausea i get from pain meds/anesthesia. I also knew i'd have to fast for a minimum of 10 hours so i waited to eat a high protein meal until later in the night closer to bed time. 

5)02/25/25 - My surgery was at 9am, and I had to check into the surgery center at 7:45am. I got up early, drank some black coffee and water (had to stop drinking 3 hours before surgery); then showered and French braided my hair since I wouldn't be able to shower for a few days. 

Check in - I checked in with the surgery center and paid the fees that my insurance didn't cover (\~$1100). 

Prep - I was taken to the back where a nurse explained the pre-op prep process. I changed into a surgical outfit, cleansed myself with some wipes and iodine in my nostril area. I met with the anesthesiologist who asked a variety of questions and talked about his process. Then I had another nurse come and hook me up to an IV and gave me an antiinflamatory and clonopin. After a bit, she came back and gave me a antibiotic via the IV and another med (which i forget what it was) that gave my lady bits a pins and needle feeling for about 30 seconds. The nurse warned me that it happens in about 50% of patients. So odd. After that, my surgeon and nurses had me explain to them in my own words what my surgery was. Then my surgeon marked up my chest. I went pee again before surgery so no catheter would be needed. Then I was walked down the hall to the OR. I want to say that I never felt uncomfortable the whole time, the staff was incredible...and the clonopin is an antianxiety so that helped i'm sure. 

Op - The OR was a buzz with activity when I got in there. I was asked again to recite why I was there and what surgery I was having as well as my full name and DOB. The nurse helped me get into the bed, where I was strapped down like a scarecrow which was a bit nerve racking at first. Then they put my legs in these pump things that help with circulation. The nurses then put warm blankets over me which were super cozy. The anethesiologist started giving me an oxygen mask and told me to breath deeply. And that's the last thing I remember. 

Immediate Post-Op - I remember a nurse telling me ""Wake up!!"". According to my husband I kept falling back asleep. It's honestly really foggy for me to recall the immediate post-op stuff. I know at some point the surgeon came and let me know that surgery went really well, that my breathing dipped once and that I had a large volume of cysts in my breasts that they were sending off for pathology (results came back as non cancerous!). I also remember my husband telling the nurse that i get sick with anesthesia so they gave me a bunch of apple sauce and a nausea med. I also received both morphine and an opioid. Then I remember a nurse talking to my husband and being upset at another nurse for giving me an additional pain med. They walked me and my husband through stuff (aftercare, but I couldn't focus). Then they asked if I wanted to leave and I said yes. I just wanted to be home. ---Although I don't remember it, my husband said I was in recovery for about two hours. The nurses also told my husband that they were surprised he wasn't a super model with how much I talked about him being attractive. My husband drove me home. 

Home Immediate Post Op - After getting home, my husband made me eat because the nurses told him to force me even if i didn't want to since i hadn't eaten in a long time and my body needed it (bagel with butter). I also had some coffee. No pain at all. ",2,1745515372.0,Reduction,0,1.0,False

how could I be  
you're not sorry what you do to me so  
how could I be  
sorry

(  
Drew the starting line in 1865  
and really ask me why I lag behind  
and blame a coffee cup  
who owns the coffee farm  
who is still not alarmed  
and who pays for those mistakes?

I'm doing great  
I've got a roof  
I can sleep safe  
I'm on the move  
I'm on the chase  
I'm giving up hate  
I don't want to always need to say  
Sorry

I‚Äôd love to hear:

‚Ä¢ Local tips for getting settled (neighborhoods to explore or avoid, hidden gems, etc.) ‚Äî> I need apartment recommendations (Work in the downtown area) 

‚Ä¢ Favorite grocery stores, coffee spots, or chill places to hang out

‚Ä¢ Community-oriented spaces for young adults or faith-based gatherings

‚Ä¢ Any practical advice you wish someone told you when you first moved to SATX or any advice at all. 

Also open to any recommendations for vets, hair salons, or other services that made your transition smoother. I‚Äôm just looking to feel grounded and connected as I settle in.

Thanks in advance, truly appreciate any insight you‚Äôre willing to share! ",0,1745515087.0,sanantonio,4,0.4,False
1k6xscp,https://i.redd.it/d5jo3jccgtwe1.jpeg,Handwritten digital journal,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share an app I made for myself but decided to post on the App Store after some friends asked for it. I‚Äôm sharing it here, too, so it doesn‚Äôt get buried in the middle of nowhere.

It‚Äôs completely free, and you just need to create your own Claude API key to use it. They give you $5 of free credit the first time, which is enough for quite a bit of use.

The app is a digital handwriting journal: anything you write gets AI feedback that analyzes your thoughts, looks for patterns, and helps you gain personal insights. It stores all your context and history‚Äîup to 200,000 symbols (there‚Äôs a tracker in Settings). After that, it starts to forget earlier entries, but there‚Äôs still plenty of memory left.

I forgot to mention that it‚Äôs available only on iPad, and you need an Apple Pencil to use it. I also recommend a screen protector like PaperLike.

Here‚Äôs the link to the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journely/id6744461713

By the way, I call it Journely. It‚Äôs like a journey but through the journal :) If you like it, please leave a review so more people can find it in the App Store search. And if you really love it, you‚Äôll find a ‚ÄúBuy me a coffee‚Äù link in Settings. :)

I‚Äôm currently working on the full version with an integrated backend and entry storage, but that‚Äôs a whole different story. This version stores all your entries on the device, uses the Claude API to process your inputs, and recognizes handwriting through AppleKit. In other words, it‚Äôs the safest option if you‚Äôre worried about your thoughts being sent to servers and seen by someone.

Check it out and let me know in the comments what you think! I hope you find it as helpful as I do‚ÄîI use it daily.",1,1745515025.0,digitaljournaling,0,1.0,False

Just started a new job so I went to waffle house; gotta eat. I got a $7.50 dollar meal with a $2.50 coffee plus tax so that came out to $10.50, which I had in cash. I told her I was gonna do a split payment. I gave her the $10.50 in cash to take care of the bill. Then, I wanted to give her a dollar in change and 75 cents on my gift card for a tip. I know that's annoying (been in food service before) but I was running low on money and getting paid the next day. I never go without tipping. Anyways, I told her I wanted to give her a tip, and she said she couldn't just put the tip in. I originally told her I wanted to do the split payment. I wanted to make it 75 cents on the gift card and give her the rest of my change. So that would come out to a $1.75 total tip, but she added 50 cents to the gift card while running my card so 75 plus the 50 cents made my gift card get declined. She made me look like a fool in front of everyone around me like I couldn't pay my bill saying ""You're card is declined!"" while clapping her nails in her palms together making me feel small because I was trying to give her as much tip as I could. So I just was gonna give her the rest of my change but she said it was ok. I said ""no its ok"", put the change in her hand, said ""here's your tip"" and walked away. I didnt even bother to count the change I ended up giving her. I usually give 5 to 7 dollar tips no matter the place I go to, but I just started a new job, had nothing to eat at my house and was waiting to get paid. She deserved that tip and needs to work on her customer service skills. I have been in customer service my whole life. It's all about respecting others.",0,1745514894.0,AITAH,8,0.33,False

We've been running some events recently to try and do some good for the city while also meeting new people and getting a bit of exercise. So far, we've visited Viktoriapark, Alexanderplatz, Tiergarten and a few smaller areas and this week we're heading to Hasenheide. We'll be there on Saturday at 2pm (Lucy-Lameck-Str entrance).

We usually walk, talk and pick up rubbish for a couple of hours, followed by beer/coffee at a sp√§ti or bar nearby. 

We're also planning to expand this to include some other easy-access sports in the future - maybe a tennis table tournament or some cage football with some cleaning up in between. 

We've already got a pretty diverse group with both English and German speakers so if you're interested about joining us this weekend, or any time in the future, you can join our [Whatsapp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CAlrhilUpGCC5loS3Wn0uF) or drop us a DM.

1k6xlq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1k6xlq5/please_help_me_understand_these_weird_incidents/,Please help me understand these weird Incidents in my life,"I don't believe in God or Supernatural powers, but things keep happening to me and I can't explain why these happen, no matter how much I try. I am mentioning few of the incidents here. 

1. It was my day off and I was just scrolling off my instagram feed and a random thought of a female co-worker came to my mind, we used to work together like 2 years ago, she was really pretty and kind person, but after leaving the job, I didn't really thought about her until this day. I just remembered her first name so it was super difficult to find her on instagram and then I tried to find it on facebook cz it is easier as you can filter the accounts by city. ( I found it weird that why I am desperately looking for her account, but couldn't stop myself). After few minutes found her account, looked at few pictures and then closed it, and went on about my daily routine. Two days later found out on my city subreddit that she was hit by car while crossing the road and she is dead now. 

2. I was having a dream, and was talking to my family members one by one, my dad gave the phone to my grandfather, he looked little worried and was trying to say something but somehow his voice was not audible to me. Dreams over, I am at university and having coffee with my friends, got a call from my mom that my grandfather had a heart attack and is no more.

3. Was reading Nietzsche book, and got super motivated and decided to change myself completely and just to make a plan, started writing thing on a notebook, I wont go into the details, but basically I wrote something like, "" Old me is dead and will rot in hell, new me is born today and will make the world he lives in heaven"". well, it was night time and after writing few pages I slept, early morning got a call from my mom that if I am okay, she seemed super worried and was unable to say anything clearly, then my dad told me she dreamt of my death.

  
now these were major incidents, other small ones that happened were, 

1. my sis returned from a trip abroad and she i picked her from airport and helped her unload her luggage bags, bags were heavy so I asked her to not worry and just leave it on me, but she insisted, so when we entered her room, I just called her by a super random manly name, just to tease her that she is so strong, just a harmless joke, nothing much. well after 15 mins she opened her bag to get something that she bought for me, and guess what, on that bag there was a brand name of some vendor and it happened to be same name that I uttered. 

2. my roommate was going away for 2 months so we decided to sublet a room that period of time, and we had some people scheduled for viewing. The first guy that came for viewing was talkative and I was listening to whatever he trying to say and wasn't paying attention, but somewhere in the middle of the convo, I felt like I had this convo before ( I thought it must be deja vu), but then suddenly I remembered a sentence that the guy said in my dream last night, and guess what he said the same sentence  that I just remembered within next few seconds.

I graduated with my BS in CS back in May 2024, and have yet to land a full time software developer job. I‚Äôm entirely lost. I‚Äôve revamped my resume, I took on an IT Technician role part time, and working as a web developer for a pretty large non-profit featured by Forbes. I've applied to 800+ jobs at this point.

I have internship experience and even a part time front end developer job during college. I made a cool React project over the summer that featured my art skills combined with coffee recipes, and am working on my Net+ right now to add more to my resume. I made a portfolio website as well. 

But no matter what I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôve yet to get a job. I came close a few times, but the companies lost the budget for the role or went into a hiring freeze. 

I feel so lost and honestly like a failure. I‚Äôve had my friends try and give me referrals to big companies like Amazon but I‚Äôm just getting ghosted, not even so much as a rejection email. I get ignored by recruiters and even when I get a referral, nothing comes from it. 

I‚Äôve been applying to in person jobs in my home city and a major metropolis area, as well as remote. I truly don‚Äôt care about salary, so I‚Äôm not even chasing after prestigious jobs. But everyday I go on LinkedIn and see someone from my uni class with less on their resume that got a high paying software job, while I‚Äôm not even able to get a callback to companies paying 25/hr.

What should I do? Is there anything else I can do to beef up my resume? As I mentioned, right now I‚Äôm working at the help desk and my company is good on promoting up, but I wanted a software development job, and they don‚Äôt seem to be hiring for those. I‚Äôve even spoken to the COO of my company and they said there‚Äôs nothing open.

I‚Äôm really trying not to be discouraged but I‚Äôm at a real loss here. I‚Äôm a U.S. citizen, but my name and picture is clearly foreign, so maybe that‚Äôs another factor? I‚Äôm not sure. 

Any advice? Thanks everyone! I‚Äôm also happy to share my anon resume here as well.

1k6xgoi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6xgoi,Spring lookbook,"I decided to FULLY COMMIT to the RU process and did a complete spring lookbook‚Ä¶ summer still in progress. I thought I‚Äôd share along with some things I learned! 

Contexts: spring, going on errands, to park/various kid activities, being at home, coffee with friends. Gardening.
Roles: Mostly mom/wife/friend! I'm on mat leave right now so no professional contexts required. 

Lessons: 
1. I‚Äôm a lot more specific than I thought! I thought I would end up with a kajillion outfits. I was surprised when I started actually looking for my happiest outfits that in reality, maybe I only like that shirt with one pair of pants. My combinations are very specific. 

2. Harmony is multifaceted. I thought x and y would work because they are in the same colour family, but as it turns out, the fabric texture is wrong. Or the shape. Etc.

3. ‚ÄúNot like other people‚Äù is NOT the same as disruption. While I was playing in the left quadrant I thought a lot of my looks were not harmonious because I tend to bright colours and a lot of pattern mixing that‚Äôs comparatively unusual. But that doesn‚Äôt have to be the case, for example leopard print, mariner stripe and gingham are all quite classic prints and as such they do have an element of harmony, even if other people aren‚Äôt reaching for that level of visual interest. 

4. Getting dressed in the morning is so easy! I already know exactly which combinations are the best ones, and my closet is organized accordingly. 

5. Through restriction, abundance. I thought I would feel overly limited or that I would feel the need to buy more stuff. It‚Äôs actually the opposite- by finding these ideal combos I feel I actually have so many possibilities. I think by pre-planning everything I‚Äôve eliminated that friction in the morning of ‚Äúugh these shoes just doesn‚Äôt work! I don‚Äôt have ANY good shoes!‚Äù (lol the drama. No, I just wasn‚Äôt choosing the right ones).

6. Shopping was so easy. After I did my initial outfit collection I did know I needed to add a few things. I was able to take online product photos and drop them into my canva file and really easily decide on a couple items to purchase.

7. I can only work on outfit combos for about 45 min to 1 hour before I start getting too nitpicky and it‚Äôs no longer fun or joyful. I suspect if I want to go shopping instead of online shop, I should plan accordingly. 

8. I have to try outfits on. Laying them on the floor is good as an initial pass but I need to wear them to confirm it works. 

9. As a result of 7&8, this was SO time consuming. It took weeks of fitting this in between other things just to get spring done, and all my summer stuff is still in progress. I‚Äôll need to start planning my fall/winter closet in early August üò≠. 

10. Role model archetype is such a good friend for me ü•≤. Asking ‚Äúif I decided for everyone what a normal outfit (or the best version) is for this activity, what would I pick?‚Äù is such a wonderful question for me.

 And a bonus eleventh lesson: I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments in the last few weeks using this approach! ",8,1745514241.0,RitaFourEssenceSystem,2,1.0,False

What has improved is my body composition (less fat and a bit more muscle).

My sleep is still very poor and I think that correlates with the brain fog and also impacts my energy. A couple of times a week I do some bodyweight and dumbbell exercises at home but I would like to have energy to exercise a lot more.

The first 2 months I took electrolytes daily but then I started getting this unquenchable thirst after dinner and would wake up in the night incredibly thirsty so I stopped taking them. As of last week it seems I have stopped waking up to drink, I just wake up very thirsty.

Yesterday I think I had a migraine, my vision got blurry but that disappeared and after that I got a headache that lasted all evening and I still have a bit of headache today. Not sure if that's related to the diet or I'm just fighting of a virus.

**What I eat:**

I stopped drinking coffee 3 weeks ago and I replaced it with a mug of hot water with more than an ounce of butter in the morning.

**Lunch**: 5-6 eggs cooked in lard and butter with 3 bacon strips

**Dinner**: about 650 grams (1.4 pound) of meat (for example 500gr ground beef and a pork chop) supplemented with some extra butter or beef fat/lard. If I eat leaner meat then I eat extra butter. I think I eat about a stick of butter a day (100 grams+).

In the evening I also regularly eat a brown butter bite (just browned butter) and several times during the week I eat some dairy such as hard raw milk cheeses or a bit of full fat sour cream. I just drink water and salt to taste.

My weight has been stable for the last 2 months, currently about 165lbs (75kg). I lost some weight in the beginning and the last weeks it seems I'm gaining some. I started at 172lbs (78kg).

I know my diet isn't the strictest since I eat pork and some dairy but I feel like I should've experienced some of the benefits by now and it's getting quite hard to keep at it while not feeling that great.

https://old.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/11cqz04/3_year_update/

It's now been about 5 years. Still sleeping good and feeling good. I'm still gluten free and alcohol free.

My sleep has been great for about the last 8-10 months. It also seems like the most recent Moderna helped sleep some too. I'm consistently getting a full 8h night's sleep with no awakenings, and feeling refreshed and good when I wake up. And I'm awake and ready to go in the mornings, I'm not feeling sleepy or slower for hours after I wake up. That was actually still an issue sometimes in years 3 and 4 even when I would sleep well. At this point my sleep is consistently pre covid quality, and I thought for a long time I would never sleep that well again.

I do still have some very mild sleeping issues but it's happened maybe two or three times this year and it's usually just problems falling asleep for a long time, like 1-4h. When it happens, the next day I will feel weirdly fine. Like almost rested, not like I got less sleep. It was also like that sometimes in years past when I would have insomnia.

It seems like it has something to do with acid reflux, throat swelling, or breathing. I had a bad cold (neg covid test but who knows) a few months ago, with swelling in the back of my throat, and I felt that night a bit of the old ‚Äúpanic‚Äù feeling when falling off to sleep, and had problems sleeping again for that night. It's hard to say what really causes the nighttime issues though. Aside from that illness, I really haven't been sick at all this year.

I'm not having any more skin problems at all, not any ingrown hairs or blemishes. I do still have some petechiae from covid that I've mentioned frequently in updates past, and I think those are there to stay permanently. 

I did notice my hair thinning some randomly last year but now it's back again and it looks fine. Maybe not pre covid but way better than immediately after, and better than last year.

I no longer look tired and old. I actually look pretty good for 34. I do notice however, that my hands in particular look weirdly older than before covid. I can tell from where I took old pictures where I was holding something. I also remember another person on here saying something about their hands looking older.

My long lasting (3+ year off and on) numbness in my toe seems to be gone. Probably has been gone all this year at least. This was one of the weirdest symptoms with no obvious cause nor any visible changes in the toe itself.

I'm continuing to adhere to the same strict schedule. I wake up between 4-6 AM, go to bed between 8-10 PM, and eat a large breakfast. Then I will have a small lunch or no lunch, and a small or medium sized dinner. It doesn't seem to matter anymore when I eat dinner but I usually prefer to eat early. Then before bed, I usually take 1-2 mg antacid which is about half what I used to take. I think that waking up early and eating the big breakfasts keeps me more alert. I'm able to drink coffee again but I'm usually limiting myself to one morning coffee thing and then afternoon tea with 4x tea bags. I started to think too much coffee was causing more nighttime awakenings.

I'm pretty much recovered I think. Life is really back to normal and I'm back to operating my businesses in mostly the same way I was before covid. This year I will likely be switching to another full time career though due to rising costs in my industry. 

I think I will continue to get the yearly Moderna because it seems like most of them have helped certain symptoms.

Otherwise nothing new to say, and it seems I have less to say each year now. It's hard to believe it's been five years! I think I will try to continue to do the yearly updates until 10 years. I had considered stopping at 5 years but these updates still seem useful to people and I continue to get comments and messages about LH all the time. Feel free to PM me and I will reply when I see it.

I don't spend much time on this sub anymore, and in recent years it doesn't seem like there's been much progress on LH research. I don't recognize many people here either, but I do in a weird way miss getting on here every day and talking with other LHs who were going through this same scary health issue with me. I like to sometimes go back through my old posts and it seems like a number of people are doing well, but others also aren't well. Then there are some people I used to see on here every day, and now they haven't been on reddit for months or years. So I have no idea what they're up to now. 

I edited the above part earlier this year. I added this today:

Reflections on the last 5 years:

The sleeping issues seem like a distinctly separate problem from the brain fog, POTS, other neuro issues like personality changes, and general tiredness and weakness. However, with better sleep, it seemed like all these problems started to go away faster and more completely.

The nighttime symptoms seem to be in some way associated with acid reflux, as interventions like famotidine and calcium antacids can help or in recent years cure the symptoms. But I‚Äôve recently realized that they also overlap somewhat with sleep apnea, like excessive urination, thirst, dry mouth, snoring, and the fact that certain upright and side sleeping positions help symptoms. However, my gf says that aside from some occasional snoring, that usually happens if I have a rare sinus infection or cold, I really don‚Äôt snore, and I breathe normally and quietly, and sleep soundly.

One thing I also notice, it seems in the springtime in particular, is that working in the heat and humidity, and wearing rubber boots, seems to tire me easier. I don‚Äôt really understand this, but it still happens sometimes, because it just happened again yesterday, April 23, 2025.

Another thing to note -  we think the sleeping symptoms might come on when I‚Äôm exposed to covid, although I continue to always test negative for it. Most of the time now, even with my strict schedule and diet, insomnia will come literally out of nowhere. These episodes also seem weirdly restorative, and over the years, whenever I have a bad bout of sleep, it seems to make me temporarily or even permanently feel better.

The problem is, once I returned home, I seem to have lost any and all desire for liquids or food. I do not want water, tea, soup, coffee or anything other liquids, nor do I want anything to eat.

I figured it was because of the pain but now I am pain free and yet I still have no inclination to drink or eat anything at all.

The first week or two was a bit chaotic figuring out workflow, but got better as I got my grinder dialed in, and figured out ways to make the process more efficient.  Now it's a quick 7-8 minutes from weighing beans to a cup ready to drink.

  
A few things I found helpful:  
1.  A 3D printed arms up clip that holds the arms up while you put the portafilter into place, or after your finished pulling your shot.  I ordered mine off Etsy, and paid a lot for a small plastic part, but the vendor mistakenly sent me two, so if you're in the Toronto area, and want one, I'd be happy to sell the extra one.  For that matter, just get a heavy duty rubber band, and wrap it at the top of one arm so it's thick enough to keep both arms up by friction.  
2.  Watching different youtuber's videos using the robot, I started weighing my portafilter basket as I pour the boiling water into it, and for 18 g of coffee, I only add about 58 g of water, enough for achieving my desired ratio for the shot.  This eliminates having to put a scale under my cup as I pull the shot, and generally I only have a drip or two come out after the shot has been pulled, if even that.  Makes cleanup a breeze!  
3.  This is the first time I used my nanofoamer pro (v1), and was having issues with ""spinout"" of the impeller, and getting a foamy consistency I was looking for.  A #8 stainless steel washer placed between the lid and shaft seems to have cured the spinout issue, and taking the jug off as soon as the OK message pops up on the display and pouring the foamy milk right away got the desired results.

Review,"Testing the Nodirz Cup Lid Brush has honestly been an eye-opener for tidying bottles and other kitchen items. The product, officially named ""Nodirz Cup Lid Brush ‚Äì 3 in 1 Cleaning Brush Set,"" combines three different cleaning tools: a U-shaped silicone brush, a stranded slit brush, and a stiff-bristle corner brush. Each component contributes to effectively brushing away residue, especially in the tough-to-clean gaps of bottle lids or coffee cup corners. I‚Äôve been using it almost daily, and while it gets the job done more often than not, there are aspects that could be further refined.

**Innovative Design and Usability**  
The design is where this multifunctional brush set shines. With its cleverly integrated three-in-one functionality, it‚Äôs thrilling to see how seamlessly each component tackles different cleaning tasks. The U-shaped silicone brush works wonders for clearing debris from cup lids, while the stiff bristle makes cleaning bottle bottoms and corners surprisingly easy. Furthermore, the stranded slit brush excels at clearing thin crevices that my regular kitchen sponge can't reach. I particularly find the crocodile grip surprisingly useful‚Äîthe little detailing adds just enough friction to reduce the chance of the tool slipping from my wet hands during usage.

**Materials and Durability**  
Crafted from high-quality plastic and silicone, this set feels sturdy without being heavy. The lightweight build makes it easy for daily use, and I‚Äôve dragged them through numerous cleaning adventures over the past weeks without noticing any significant wear or loss of bristle density. Calling the material environmentally friendly is always a big plus for such items, though the real-life eco-friendliness will primarily depend on how long you can keep these brushes around. They aren't flimsy, which reassures me this product is in it for the long haul.

**Wide Range of Applications**  
Its versatility is no marketing fluff‚ÄîI‚Äôve used it practically everywhere. From scrubbing leftover gunk out of reusable straws to ensuring my coffee lids are stain-free, the brushes have proven themselves versatile across various kitchen tasks. I‚Äôve even taken them beyond the kitchen, trying them out on lightweight crevices like tile grooves. The only places where the performance slightly underwhelms are unusually narrow areas where even the stranded slit brush seems bulkier than ideal.

**Strengths**  
- Clever combination of three brush types for different cleaning needs.  
- Ergonomic grip for enhanced handling during cleaning.  
- Strong, durable materials for sustained use.  
- Compact and lightweight design‚Äîperfect for travel or outdoor use.  
- Versatile applications‚Äîeffective in cleaning bottles, lids, and tile crevices.

**Potential Weaknesses**  
- Slightly limited in ultrathin crevices despite being a ""slit"" brush.  
- The bright, multicolored theme might not fit everyone‚Äôs aesthetic taste.  
- Silicone components, though helpful, may occasionally push soft remnants into further gaps rather than extract them.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Competing with other bottle-cleaning tools like the OXO Good Grips Water Bottle Cleaning Set or the Full Circle Bottle Brush, the Nodirz Cup Lid Brush holds its ground pretty well. While the OXO set offers a softer aesthetic appeal and interchangeable bristle types, it slightly falls short in multifunctionality compared to Nodirz's three-in-one compact design. On the other hand, Full Circle brushes, while eco-friendly and functional for specific purposes, don‚Äôt offer the same level of versatility that Nodirz provides across cup lids, bottles, and smaller crevices. Nodirz feels like the right choice if compact, travel-friendly designs and multifunctionality are your primary concerns.

**True Value**  
Considering the range of issues it tackles in a typical kitchen clean-up routine, the price-to-quality ratio of this multifunctional cleaner feels fair. It may not necessarily offer luxury-grade aesthetics or super-premium materials, but as an affordable gadget, its performance delivers more than expected. You‚Äôre getting significant bang for your buck with this tool, making it an appealing option for practical purposes.

My partner is amazing and very patient man. Im very very fortunate to have him in my life and I dont want to push him out of it because of temporary insanity brought on by my luteal phase each month. I usually only have 1 to 2 really bad days, 2 days or so before my period.  Im pretty aware of how my brain melts down these two days, so besides just having terrible sadness and depression,  Im usually okay with keeping the crazy away from everyone else. Lately though its been really bad. I get this terrible crushing feeling that I am not good enough for my partner, that I am not  his ideal partner, and that he will leave me and there is no way he could possibly love me as much as I love him. This doesn't usually result in anger towards him, just a resentment that I dont feel wanted or valuable to him. Which my clear headed self knows this is dumb, because this man tells me every day how much  he loves and adores me. This week was exceptionally bad, got super self destructive and sad about some stuff going on, and got really pasdive aggressive and made a really rude comment,i should have never made, and was completely unfair and just overall shitty of me. I knew it was wrong when I said it and was honestly trying to get a response when he was probably overwhelmed by all my passive aggressive  bs, and I reacted completely irrationally and full on dick mode. Im very ashamed and of course I look at the calendar of when my cycle is due and its at the end of this week. Im not usually outwardly mean like that, I twnd to get weepy and clingy and my fear of abandonment makes me a stage 5, which is suffocating and exhausting for him.

Anyways I am looking into treatments. Gonna start chasteberry today, and some other supplements that are shown to help. Gonna decrease caffeine, because I love him more than coffee. Gonna try and cut sugar and get more exercise. All things research says will help, and if that fails, Im gonna go ahead and ask my doctor to prescribe the antidepressant she suggested years ago before I met my bf. I was too scared of the side effects then, but nothing can be as bad as hurting him or possibly losing him because of this.

Im asking you other partners of PMDD what would help you as a partner of someone with this disorder? What can I do besides absolutely internalizing all melt downs,to make sure he still feels emotionally safe in this relationship?",7,1745513821.0,PMDDpartners,1,1.0,False

The idea for this post came up this morning when I was waiting on line for Kora and overheard a convo between Two young girls.

Then one of them said she hopes people don‚Äôt find out about it because then everyone will want to move here, then the neighborhood will get gentrified etc etc‚Ä¶ 

I admit, I had to roll my eyes. I found it ironic that they were talking about gentrification when in line for a new boujee bakery when we have more than a handful of other local bakeries. In reality, The neighborhood doesn‚Äôt need another bakery. I have no problems with Kora, in fact they‚Äôre phenomenal, but I did pay $48 for 5 pastries and 2 coffees. That‚Äôs a shit ton.

All this to say, I‚Äôm in favor of more places like Kora opening up, at least in their modernity, but more diversity is needed. I don‚Äôt need another bakery, bodega or mini-market.

Of COURSE there is a sub for specifically conures. Why wouldn't there be?

Anyway, this is just an introduction. I have 2 conures but today I'm introducing you to Julius Jeremiah Jones. He's an absolute asshole, the reason none of my coffee mugs match, why I know how to disassemble my stereo speakers and why I learned CAD to design port covers for those speakers. He's a Bishop in the Church of Chaos and believes, STRONGLY,  in high entropy solutions. Anything that is a single piece will obviously be better as multiple pieces.

Julius will fight with anything for any reason. My B&G Macaw only barely tolerates him but Julius will gladly attack that bird for sitting on the perch Julius wants. He'd land next to a horse and then attack the horse for being too close.

He is, in all ways, a true and perfect example of a conure. He's loud, curious, playful, affectionate, hostile, pretty, messy, destructive and unpredictable.

I got him from a local shop, not because I wanted another bird but because I was the only customer they had that wasn't put off by his nipping. He was young and the only people interested in adopting him were new to birds and the shop recognized this one needed an experienced and firm (but gentle) hand.

He's 4 now and has recently decided that climbing under the oven is a good idea. So now I know how to take my oven apart. I can't wait to see what antics he gets up to next.

I have something to pick up in your city this coming weekend. Since it is a drive of several hours to get to your city for me (I live nearish to Regina) I had the idea that perhaps my partner could come and we would stay a night in your town. 

We are both late 30‚Äôs and like breakfast spots, coffee shop, Indian/asian/canadian cuisine, she likes vegetarian, pubs, breweries, clubs with live music (preferably not faded hits cover bands but we take what we can get :) etc etc.

We always prefer to stay in an area where we can park the vehicle and spend our day/evening exploring a town/city by foot. 

The last time I was downtown Medicine Hat was nearly 20 years ago and my band played in this little club on the second floor of a place that had a restaurant on the main level (don‚Äôt remember the name of the establishment) and I remember my band mates and I found an interesting bar pub in the old train station (if my memory is accurate) where we had supper but other than that my memory of downtown Medicine Hat is that it was an absolute ghost town. We arrived in the afternoon and marvelled at how absolutely nothing was open that day. We walked several blocks without seeing a single person (including homeless) At one point I walked out into the middle of an intersection and yelled at the top of my lungs that I was the king of Medicine Hat.. 

So to wind this up, I notice that there is only one hotel downtown and currently no Air B&B‚Äôs in the area..

Is it possible to spend a day and night in your downtown area, keep ourselves entertained and fed without need to drive too much (especially in the evening because we like to hop to a few different spots for a drink or 2) Has your downtown area recovered from all the big box sprawl and could keep a couple of adults busy for 24hrs? We did something similar in Moose Jaw a few years ago. We are very familiar with smaller cities and not snobby towards them at all. Thanks for any advice.

I've been maintaining my weight for a few years now, changing my lifestyle and getting an active job making it not too difficult. Currently, I eat similar ish things daily, and a low calorie, simpler meal when going out, but don't hesitate to enjoy normal birthday cakes, or the cookies in the break room. When festive months or too many party weekends in a row come around, I put on a pound or three, and pretty cyclically now, I'll tighten up about once or twice a year to get back to the 118-122 range that shows my muscle definition, and I feel best at for a big event or summer. Pretty consistently now, I will start to eat 1300-1600 calories and instantly get sick a week later. Obviously, when I'm doing this for an upcoming event, I realize I cannot be sick and miss it, so jump off the tracking and eat extra. I get better over the next week, but would I if I kept eating less? 

  


Also, why is this happening? I am not overly restrictive in my 'cut', and eat very well balanced and healthily. A day may look like a few coffees with a bit of protein shake in them, some apples for breakfast. 2 eggs+ 2 egg whites, onion and peppers, broccoli omelette with two pieces of toast and some cottage cheese for lunch. I'm a big snacker, so some fruit, yogurt, cereal bits through the afternoon, and something like a fish with rice or potato and big veggie or fruit bowl for dinner. Half a cookie for dessert, etc. I'll have a nice *whoosh* after a week or two, and typically drop about 3-5 pounds over the month, when I'll chill out again and start eating out or extra treats.

  


I don't know why my body freaks out! Especially when I don't feel particularly thin or anything besides quite hardy before I start only eating at home and taking the odd chips, grilled cheese, and french fries out of the diet. I feel like I should be feeling healthier, not sicker. The first few days I usually feel great from less sodium and sugar, but day 6 and 7 always come down with a cold! I used to be more into intermittement and regular fasting, and I don't know a ton, but the autophagy stuff was super intriguing to me. I might sound like an idiot, but does that in anyway contribute to any immunity boosting effects of weightloss or CICO diets? Does this happen to anyone else, and do you have any tips or ideas about why?



Thank you!



For context I'm a 21 F, 5' 4"", and lost 40 pounds about 4 years ago, regained about 20, and maintain around there, 118-123.

**1. Afnan 9PM**  

Best clone I‚Äôve ever smelled. Super versatile, great projection and longevity. I love that sweet, fruity, bubblegum vibe. One of the best fragrances I have ever smelled.



**2. Rue Broca Theoreme**  

Really nice citrusy opening, fresh and sweet but not overwhelming. Although it is a citrus bomb, the grapefruit makes it stand out and it doesn‚Äôt smell like most fresh and it is very unique. For the price of $22 it‚Äôs insane. Best summer scent I‚Äôve had.



**3. Lattafa Kingdom**  

Clean clone of JPG Elixir. Smells nice, nothing to complain about. Simple and good.



**4. Ameer Al Oudh**  

Very sweet, smells like toasted marshmallows. Kinda like By The Fireplace, but Ameer lacks that darker, smokier, more coffee-ish vibe. Definitely softer and sweeter. Also, the projection is really good.



**5. Quad Al Fursan**  

For the price, it‚Äôs so good. Pineapple is super natural and refreshing. Only downside: the drydown has too much saffron and projection isn‚Äôt top-tier.



**6. Lattafa Khamrah Qawa**  

Not a bad scent, performance is actually crazy good. But it smells kinda like a vanilla candle with some cinnamon. Not bad, just not amazing and definitely a bit overhyped. 



**7. Lattafa Honor & Glory**  

Leans a bit feminine, but it‚Äôs a smooth vanilla with a hint of caramel. Really pleasant overall but nothing special. Performance is just ok.



**8. Lattafa Fakhar**  

Smells very close to YSL Y. I did a side by side test and it‚Äôs almost identical. The OG is a bit spicier and performs better, but still, this one is great. Just not 100% my vibe.



**9. Vibrant Vetiver**  

Lemon and grass scent, but like dry grass, not freshly cut. Kinda meh performance. I wear it sometimes but it is deffinitly not my type.



**10. Afnan Collector‚Äôs Edition**  

Ambroxan bomb with pineapple and a bit of citrus. For me, there‚Äôs too much ambroxan, which reminds me of Sauvage DNA (Sauvage also has a lot of ambroxan), which I really don‚Äôt like. Overall not that bad, but also nothing special or amazing, I was just expecting a bit more. Pineapple is almost the same as in Quad Al Fursan, and overall it‚Äôs a bit too dark and spicy for me. Def not for summer. Maybe it will grow on me over time.



**11. Lattafa Hayati**  

Smells like laundry detergent. Mid performance. Price is okay, but this one just doesn‚Äôt get much use from me.

1k6wzg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeGearReviews/comments/1k6wzg6/does_klimaire_minisplit_air_conditioner_deliver/,Does Klimaire Mini-Split Air Conditioner Deliver on Its Promises? Detailed Review,"The Klimaire KSIV012-H119-S(W) ductless mini-split air conditioner isn't just another cooling system‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerhouse designed to tackle both cooling and heating with efficiency and style. Reviewing this product felt as though I was unraveling the intricacies of a high-tech companion meant to keep life comfortable and manageable. Klimaire isn‚Äôt an unfamiliar name to me, but this specific model elevated my expectations significantly, offering ample opportunities to explore its features in real-world settings.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about this split system was its minimalist and modern aesthetic. Its dimensions (31.57 x 7.44 x 11.69 inches) make it sleek enough to blend seamlessly into various home styles without being intrusive. With a clean white finish, it doesn‚Äôt scream for attention yet exudes sophistication‚Äîperfect for anyone striving for subtlety in their home appliances. I tested the unit in my office, where space efficiency and clean lines are important, and it didn‚Äôt feel bulky or out of place at all. Its durability gives confidence, backed by Klimaire's anti-corrosive golden fin technology for protection. Trust me, if you live near the coast or in humid areas, this is a fantastic lifesaver.  

**Ease of Installation**

When undertaking the installation process, I dived headfirst into its all-inclusive kit, which comes with a 16-foot Maxwell refrigerant line, interconnecting wire cables, and a mounting bracket. Unless you‚Äôre holding an HVAC certificate, you'll need professional help, but I appreciated how thoughtfully Klimaire pre-packaged everything. In roughly two hours, my technician got it up and running‚Äîwithout additional purchases required. Frankly, compared to systems that piece-meal their kits just to maximize profits, this was refreshing.  

[Check Klimaire KSIV012-H119-S(W) deals on Amazon now.](https://ehomeco.com/p/b07tdr51bw/)  

**Performance and Energy Efficiency**

Utilizing as much wattage as a typical coffee machine, this air conditioning unit pushes boundaries with its 20.8 SEER2 energy rating. This is no small feat, especially for those conscious of their environmental footprint‚Äîor their energy bills. Testing its cooling power in a 550-square-foot room during peak summer heat proved successful. Temperatures dropped from a sweaty 85¬∞F to a comfortable 72¬∞F in under 15 minutes, showing off its turbo mode capabilities. Furthermore, wintertime tests indicated dependable heating, effectively keeping my children‚Äôs playroom cozy (and tantrum-free). As for noise levels, it‚Äôs whisper-quiet, functioning as low as 28 dB inside my bedroom‚Äîa feature I now cherish during evening Netflix sessions.  

**Good Points**

- High energy efficiency with a 20.8 SEER2 rating, making it eco-friendly.
- Versatile‚Äîequipped with both cooling and heating modes to cater year-round.
- Low ambient cooling and heating even at extreme temperatures.
- Silent operation, suitable even for bedrooms or studies.
- Packaged inclusively with a 16' installation kit and mounting hardware.

**Limitations**

- Professional installation is strongly recommended, leading to additional setup costs.
- Not Energy Star certified, which might disappoint sustainability enthusiasts.
- Slightly bulky outdoor condenser requires strategic placement for aesthetics.

**Advanced Features**

This mini-split doesn‚Äôt merely cool or heat‚Äîit‚Äôs smart too. Frankly, I geeked out a little when syncing it with my smart devices. It easily integrates with Alexa or Google Home, and the mobile app compatibility allowed me to set temperatures remotely before coming home from errands. There‚Äôs also a useful ""Follow Me"" function that adapts to the thermostat's location, ensuring targeted comfort instead of cooling an entire room unnecessarily. Additionally, it has a Dry Mode, helpful in muggy climates where humidity control is essential. The self-cleaning mode was the cherry on top, simplifying upkeep while improving longevity‚Äîtruly a feature for anyone with a knack for forgetting regular maintenance (aka me).  

**Product Comparisons**

When sizing up this mini-split unit against some of its peers, like Mitsubishi‚Äôs MSZ-GL12NA or Daikin‚Äôs 12,000 BTU Ductless Mini-Split, Klimaire clearly excels in affordability, especially when factoring in the installation kit inclusion. Mitsubishi might have higher SEER ratings but tends to come at a steeper upfront cost. Meanwhile, Daikin performs evenly but lacks some of the smart home compatibility options that Klimaire offers. From turbo modes to its efficient operation, the Klimaire unit emerges as a winner for homeowners focused on both functionality and tech ease. Though, its lack of an Energy Star certification might make an eco-conscious buyer lean toward Mitsubishi.  

**Smart Spending**

This unit won't break the bank. Considering its durability‚Äîbolstered by a 5-year warranty on parts and 7 years on the compressor‚Äîit offers reliable performance without the high maintenance costs associated with some larger systems. The auto-restart function alone saved me during a couple of power surges last week, all without frying the electronics. Investing in this product feels like smart spending when juxtaposed with soaring energy prices and lower-efficiency cooling/heating solutions.

I admit, watching the episode from an entertainment perspective was quite fun and even satisfying in some way. **HOWEVER:**

1. We can all agree both of them were hurt and NONE of them is better than the other.
2. Maria could have thanked Verity for the fact that her chocolate was even praised at the start.
3. She failed to learn from past mistakes and treat her somewhat nicely or at least decently, since both of them are ‚Äúadults‚Äù and working in an ‚Äúadult job.‚Äù
4. Maria felt threatened from the start when she saw Verity. Instead of doing what‚Äôs in point 2 and/or 3, she chose to ignore it and brush it under the carpet.
5. I saw a post earlier saying how Verity came across as horrifying, given the fact that the OP had been gaslighted, too. Let‚Äôs be real: If you‚Äôve never done anybody wrong, the episode probably didn‚Äôt hit that deep. If you *have*... Verity probably triggered something. She had a motive behind what she did. In real life, sometimes people *are* just evil and there's nothing you can do about it. We all carry wounds, and the world will trigger us in different ways.
6. Now, for the people saying ‚ÄúVerity should have given Maria grace‚Äù and ‚Äúnobody deserves to die‚Äù - I get it. And before all the ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and ""*but nobody is perfect""* people crawl out of their shells, let me tell you a bit of a story. A while back, I was friends with this girl. I made the mistake of kissing her ex right after their breakup and basically used the excuse of *‚Äúthis friendship wasn‚Äôt real anyway,‚Äù* since our friendship had always felt one-sided. After she moved to a different city, the friendship kind of faded, we were only friends for like a year or two during college. After a year of this incident, I decided to meet her over coffee and get it off my chest. In the grand scheme of things, you might say (and I was telling myself this too) that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, especially since her ex even tried to get back with her later. She was already aware of what happened; she found out through someone else and never confronted me. But honestly, I never wished her harm. Regardless of how our friendship was, **she‚Äôs a human. And she has feelings!** which I got to realise over time and couldn't let my own self to be okay with what I did. I didn‚Äôt want her to walk around thinking all people are terrible or that this is just how friends behave. And to be honest, I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending everything was fine under the excuse of *‚Äúit was just a kiss.‚Äù* 

So yeah, maybe I do have ‚Äúunrealistically high moral standards"" but I can‚Äôt live in a world where we normalise toxicity, harm and never self-reflect. Or maybe... I‚Äôve just grown up. **Something Maria, clearly, failed to do. And Verity?** She was a deeply traumatised child who grew up in a toxic environment, completely alone. If you‚Äôve never gone through that and if you‚Äôve always had friends at school, family support, or safety, you don‚Äôt get to preach. **Nobody is justifying** what Verity did. But you should at least *try* to walk in someone else‚Äôs shoes before jumping in with the usual: *‚ÄúBut what about her? But she should have given grace too!‚Äù* **- Ugh.** And guess what? Both of them were seriously wrong and in an ideal world, both of them should have gone to therapy and gotten their shit sorted.

On the final point, I guess integrity is one of the disappearing qualities in today‚Äôs world. And honestly, this is kinda what Black Mirror does the best: exposes the double standards of society, and I'm loving getting validation from seeing y'all's comments - in what kinda f'd up world we live in.

Before I start i'm a freelancer, so I don't need to be anywhere on time like a normal person.

So wake up when I like and and slee when I like too.

However from more then 2 weeks, I wake up quite agitated which is normal in other days too but I've noticed in those days it wears off very easily (as wash my face had my breakfast and I'm fine) but now it's persisting.

I no longer am feeling ambition to do anything, y'know the feeling from inside to improve and grow, hell even sit and enjoy cup of coffee. Nah.

Try sitting down read, can't focus, And trying too make me feel more agitated, then exercise started to do and usually I feel satisfaction after I exercise, now agitated, watching a movie I couldn't focus

And worse of all the agitation in all of those things I've started to cope with excess masterbation, over eating and sometimes yelling.

Am I depressed? And the same routine is happening for more then week now. I'd appreciate your response

1k6wl0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k6wl0f/my_40m_friends_27f_relationship_is_falling_apart/,"My, 40M, friend‚Äôs, 27F, relationship is falling apart and I‚Äôve developed feelings for her‚Äîhow do I navigate this situation?","I‚Äôm 40, and a couple of years ago, I moved back to my hometown. Not long after, I crossed paths at a party with someone I now consider a close friend‚Äîshe‚Äôs 27 but there's a twist. She is also considered a cousin however we're not blood related‚Äîwe don't share any lineages between grandparents. We had known of each other before that party, just in passing, never having spent time together in the past anywhere. But that night something clicked. We realized we shared a lot of the same interests, and from that point on, we just kind of naturally became close.

She‚Äôs in a relationship‚Äîhas been for about 2.5 years now‚Äîwith someone I was loosely acquainted with before they got together. Over time, and through conversations with her and mutual friends, it‚Äôs become clear that the relationship is rocky. She‚Äôs told me they‚Äôre fundamentally incompatible‚Äîsomething she didn‚Äôt recognize early on. They rushed into things, moved in together after just a month, and have been trying to make it work ever since.

She‚Äôs adventurous, loves being out‚Äîdinners, concerts, weekends away, even just hanging out poolside. He‚Äôs the opposite. He stays home, locked into video games, barely interested in leaving the house. Our friendship started off as completely platonic. I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything beyond someone to share good times with. We matched energy-wise in a way that felt rare‚Äîother friends might enjoy the same things, but they don‚Äôt have the stamina or consistency she does. We could go out one weekend and be ready for the next, but we also kept things balanced‚Äîtrying different experiences, not just partying.
Last summer is when the dynamic subtly shifted. We started spending more time one-on-one, and it was mutual‚Äîshe‚Äôd invite me out, I‚Äôd do the same. At first, I still saw it as a friendship. I figured she needed an outlet, a break from the stagnancy of her relationship. Her boyfriend refused to go anywhere, even simple errands. He‚Äôd rather wait in the car, texting her to hurry up, than come inside and say hello. I‚Äôve even invited him out to join us‚Äîwhether it was just the two of us or with a group‚Äîbut he never came.
She‚Äôs confided in me that he only wants to spend time together when it involves his people‚Äîhis friends, his family. And even then, she feels out of place. I know his family too; they‚Äôre not mean, but they carry a kind of superiority that would wear on anyone.

Somewhere along the way, my feelings started to change. It wasn't sudden. It was more like one day I just became aware‚Äîaware that I cared for her in a different way. But I‚Äôve kept it to myself. I know she‚Äôs not happy in her relationship, but she‚Äôs also not free to leave. She‚Äôs afraid of the fallout from family and friends, and practically speaking, she can‚Äôt afford to be on her own. From what she‚Äôs shared, it sounds like they‚Äôve become roommates more than anything‚Äîhe sleeps on the couch most nights.
And as for whether she might feel something too? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never been good at reading people‚Äîespecially when it comes to this kind of thing. There are moments, though. I‚Äôve caught her looking at me across a room, like she‚Äôs thinking something she won‚Äôt say. And then there was our most recent night out. She stayed close the whole time‚Äîsat beside me instead of across, leaned in, touched my arm or leg in passing. It wasn‚Äôt overt, but it was more physical than usual. We‚Äôd been drinking, and she was more tipsy than I was (I was the designated driver), but we‚Äôve both been drunk before‚Äîmany times‚Äîand she‚Äôs never acted that way.

That night, for the first time, she invited me into her home. Her boyfriend was there, glued to his games, just like she said he would be. She was drunk, and he didn‚Äôt even get up to greet her, let alone check if she was okay. She asked me to stay and have tea‚ÄîI said yes, though we never actually made any. We sat on the couch for a bit until she suddenly felt sick and rushed to the bathroom. He didn‚Äôt seem to care, so I followed her in and helped her through it. Afterward, as she headed back to the living room, she started yelling things down the hall toward him‚Äîstuff that wasn‚Äôt exactly kind. I stepped in, gently redirected her away, and got her to sit back down. She lay across my lap for a while, quiet, until she needed to be sick again. I helped her through it, just like before. Each time, she‚Äôd say more things at him‚Äîaccusations about being inattentive, rude, lazy‚Äîbut I kept positioning myself between them, trying to diffuse things. I honestly don‚Äôt know if he heard or just didn‚Äôt care. Eventually, she decided it was time for pajamas. I walked her to the bedroom and waited outside in case she stumbled. That‚Äôs when I heard her crying‚Äîreally crying. I went in, sat beside her on the bed, and she opened up‚Äîtold me how lonely and sad she felt, how she didn‚Äôt know how her life ended up this way. I didn‚Äôt say much. I just stayed, brushed her hair back, and listened until she fell asleep. Once I knew she was okay‚Äîbreathing fine and staying put‚ÄîI left a bucket and some water by her bed, then quietly went home.

After I got home that night, I sent her a quick text asking her to call me when she woke up, just to check in and see how she was feeling. She did, and we ended up talking for about an hour. She seemed a little lighter than the night before, though still a bit worn out from everything. I offered to bring her a coffee, and when I showed up, it was just the two of us‚Äîher boyfriend was still inside, absorbed in his games (I brought him a coffee as well). We sat outside together, just the two of us and talking about nothing and everything. We stayed there for over an hour, the conversation flowing naturally, before she had to head out to meet her mom. 
I wanted to mention how upset she had been the night before, how vulnerable she‚Äôd looked when she was crying in bed, but it didn‚Äôt feel right. She was still recovering from the hangover, and the timing just felt off. I didn‚Äôt want to add to the weight she was already carrying, so I decided against bringing it up. I left once her mom arrived, feeling like I had maybe dodged a bullet, but knowing it was still on my mind.
The whole week, though, I couldn‚Äôt shake it. I felt for her deeply. More than that, I just wanted her to know that she wasn‚Äôt alone. That I was here for her, no matter what. I didn‚Äôt want her to feel isolated in that mess, especially if she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to turn to in that moment.
Fast forward to the following weekend, and we were together again‚Äîthis time to help her mom move some furniture. Afterward, we met up with some friends, had a few laughs around a bonfire, and it felt like a good, normal evening. But as we headed back to her place, I felt the familiar pull to talk to her about the things that had been sitting on my chest all week. It felt like maybe the moment had arrived‚Äîlike the time had finally come to tell her how much I cared and what I had seen that night. But in hindsight, I realize it probably wasn‚Äôt the best timing.
As we were pulling up to her house, I turned to her and said, ""I wanted to tell you that night‚Äîwhen I saw you crying in bed, how sad and alone you seemed, how much I wanted to be there for you. I just didn't want you to feel like you were carrying that by yourself.""
She didn‚Äôt shut down or resist it. She seemed to take it in, nodded, and thanked me for saying it. But I think I caught her off guard. I‚Äôd waited too long to mention it, and by then, we were so close to her place that I didn‚Äôt give her any time to really unpack what I‚Äôd said. It was like I threw it out there and then immediately had to walk away. The rest of the night ended with the usual ‚Äútalk through the week‚Äù and ‚Äúcall me if you‚Äôre not going away this weekend.‚Äù She had mentioned she was hoping to spend the weekend with a long distant girl friend she hadn‚Äôt seen in a while, but that friend had gone quiet on her. I think that weighed on her, too.
Looking back, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I might‚Äôve screwed up. Maybe I put her on the spot. I know how much she struggles with anxiety, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I made her feel a little embarrassed or uncomfortable. Now I‚Äôm left trying to figure out what to do next. Part of me wants to leave the ball in her court and give her space, let her process everything in her own time. But the other part‚Äîwell, I just want to make sure she knows I‚Äôm still here for her, no matter how much time has passed and I don't want to miss any time with her even if it remains a friendship.

(Worst (best) Episode Yet?!?),"""Why does iced coffee taste different from different coffee shops"" Fug stupidly asks to start the episode. Alex says she likes a basic Folgers coffee to which he replies ""That seems on brand for you...."" 

And we're off! 

It's obvious he is starting to feel like he's a celebrity/influencer.  Feels like he's starting to try and become the main character. He starts by bashing a coffee shop by name because he didn't like his coffee, plugs one of his ""investments"" in a sandwich company and spends time plugging that.

Then, we once again enter the topic of how they haven't been together for a long time, once again a narrative they feel they need to keep control on and provide further evidence/examples of how happy they are despite not being so much as engaged. The first ""topic""/question is:, ""Both of you always give off the energy that you've been together for years now,"" (just laugh out loud funny) which leads into detailing FIGHTS! Alex stating she needed space and Fug asked too many questions, which she calls miscommunication, and which he rebuttals he sensed she had problems on her mind and he could just tell and he was trying to help her problem solve and felt Alex was being rude to him, and she is immediately apologetic and already surrenders the blame and that she was at fault. (Red flags all over the place). He then throws a temper tantrum and when they went to the gym together, he was on the treadmill and when Alex joined, he stormed off and moved somewhere else. 

Then as Harrison addresses the initial topic, and it gets dangerously close to admission that Tate was not part of the plan. ""The reason we give that impression is because we were thrust into a real sink or swim environment.  Are we gonna step up to the plate and work on things together."" 
Alex bursts into her classic ""when you know, you know"" in an attempt to almost steer him back to this falling in love moment happening before the baby, and he agrees although with a big BUT, and again pushes how their unique situation forced them to see eye to eye. Alex says ""we got pregnant fast, there was a lot we went through."" ""Because it was an expedited path we had to work on our relationship"". Fug says they aren't perfect, but he is proud of their relationship (why do they share this shit?!?!  They think they are so important!)

Classic Alex the amount of times this episode she says something, is contradicted by Fug, and the next words that come out of her mouth are ""I agree"" is record setting. 

Then comes the house stuff, which I have seen discussed already so will leave that there, in summary Alex has NO idea what's going on and has been set up to be left in the dust if/when these two split down the road. Never seen people so openly admit to not being that excited about their home purchase beyond feeling trapped into purchasing said home.

Hi everyone,

I've now been out of my house for 6 months due to the presence of black mold. This exposure has led to several health issues, and after a lot of research and two nose surgeries, I discovered that I've developed **histamine intolerance**. This could either be genetic or triggered by prolonged exposure to mold. Here's what I've learned over these months and how I'm managing it:

1. **Histamine Intolerance** It turns out that my body struggles with histamine, and the symptoms I experience ‚Äî such as swollen turbinates in my nose, acid reflux, post-nasal drip, and anxiety ‚Äî are all related to this intolerance. I'm still figuring out the best way to manage it.
2. **Diet and Managing Histamine** In an effort to balance my histamine levels, I've started a strict diet, mainly eating meat from the butcher and an avocado before meals to maintain B6 production. This helps, but there's a problem. Whenever I try this diet or fast for a period, I experience constipation, which worsens my histamine reactions. The constipation leads to even more severe symptoms, such as increased nasal swelling and acid reflux.
3. **Caffeine as a Solution** I've added coffee to my routine, and surprisingly, it helps with constipation. After having a bowel movement, I notice a reduction in swelling in my nose, which indicates that a lot of my symptoms are likely stemming from issues in my stomach and digestion.
4. **Fasting Considerations** I considered doing a water fast, but after some thought, I believe it would do more harm than good for me right now. Since I've been dealing with these stomach issues, I probably have some vitamin deficiencies, and fasting could make this worse in the short term. I‚Äôm sticking with the anti-histamine diet for now and seeing how my body responds.
5. **Looking Ahead** I‚Äôm not sure if long-term water fasting would be the answer, but I‚Äôm planning to stick with this diet for a longer period before exploring other options.  I would love to hear if anyone has experience with histamine intolerance, black mold exposure, or long-term fasting in cases like mine.",1,1745511520.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

Is this really the best defence Watchtower Tract Society can present? Is this really all they got?

The video posted on JW .org called ‚ÄúPut Up a Hard Fight for the Faith‚Äù! shows 3 experiences of Jehovah's Witnesses who stopped attending meetings and returned to the organisation.

[https://www.jw.borg/en/library/videos/#en/mediaitems/VODIntExpEndurance/pub-jwbcov21\_22\_VIDEO](https://www.jw.borg/en/library/videos/#en/mediaitems/VODIntExpEndurance/pub-jwbcov21_22_VIDEO)  
(Remove B from borg)

In the video there is **not even ONE refutation** to what WT labels as ""apostate lies"". Watchtower is unable to disprove these claims, because claims brought against it are true and factual. Trying to refute something that is 100% true, factual and accurate, would be yet another proof of Watchtower twisting facts and outright lying. Watchtower cannot refute something that is irrefutable, so when they cannot actually argue against THE ARGUMENT or THE REASON, they demonise the ACT OF LEAVING or QUESTIONING itself.

Here is an example to illustrate what is really happening here:  
Imagine a school principal accused of mismanaging funds, with clear evidence like receipts and bank statements showing money was misused. Instead of addressing the evidence or explaining the discrepancies, the principal holds an assembly and says, ""Those who spread these rumors are just troublemakers who hate our school. Their disloyalty is shameful, and associating with them will ruin your future. Anyone who dares to bring claims against me could face disciplinary action and expulsion from the school."" The principal never refutes the specific claims or engages with the evidence, focusing instead on condemning the act of questioning their authority.

Here is a breakdown:

|Person|Reason given for leaving WT|Reason given for returning|According to WT why you should not leave?|Why is this fallacious?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Bettie Sullivan**|\- acquaintance told her she is in a cult but apparently she was also looking for a reason to stop believing|\- she drove by the Kingdom Hall and thought: ""They are all there waiting for Armageddon"", and then said to herself, ""Well at least they feel good about themselves. How do you feel?"" She then says that she felt terrible.|\- because other JWs will feel good about themselves and you will feel terrible. Jehovah is the best in the universe, and you will be happy to be back under Jehovah's wings. Relationship with Jehovah is most precious.|\- the fact that she felt terrible could be because all her friends and family cut her off and she felt lonely. She was also probably devastated to learn that she was in a cult and that her life was based on a lie.|
|**Alexandre Oliveira De Aquino**|\- employee told him about someone who could prove to him JWs don't have the truth, he ""fed his mind"" with different ideas. His spiritual routine was dead.|\- he couldn't find anything else in accord with what 'he knew' Bible taught. He prayed to Jehovah to show him the way to the truth and he took away this feeling of emptiness, spiritually speaking|\- Because there is nothing out there that resembles WT teachings about the Bible. because you have to use Jehovahs name, and speaking about Jehovah will become an amazing joy and your ministry will be very productive|\- Not being able to find a different religion in accord to WT teachings only proves that WT has different set of beliefs, not the truth. To claim that 'he knew' is wrong. He did not know the Bible, because it was  WT who taught him everything.|
|**Justin Ochoa**|\- associating with former members or others who weren't zealous. He did research and ""it started to influence the way he felt and thought about things"". He was combative with the elders and made an accusation that ""Noah's Ark was a fairly tale""!|\-  elders through skilful use of scripture, helped him to realise that he was taken captive by human philosophy, deceptions and 'empty reasonings of men'.|\- because you have to  study the bible with sincerity and it has to affect your mind and heart. You cannot let empty reasoning of men deceive you.|\- Associating with people who have different ideas should not be wrong if their ideas are valid and align with facts. He is painted as being combative and making accusations, also implied he did not study the bible with sincerity.|

This video clearly shows how instead of actually refuting that they are a cult, for example, they focus on emotional aspects, like, ""well if you leave the organisation you will feel shit, but everyone else will all be happy and smiley at the Kingdom Hall, so you better get back"". It does not matter that everyone literally by their behaviour, which is shunning and cutting off contact, is showing and proving that they are indeed a cult. A destructive high control group that will shame you and guilt trip you, until you, feel and think and do exactly what they tell you to do, is a by definition a cult and a high control group.

They will tell you that you are 'combative', and 'insincere', but that elders are 'skilful'. They will tell you that you are 'taken captive by deceptions and empty reasoning of men', without providing any evidence. They will tell you that simply because you speak with people that have different ideas from WT, it is automatically wrong, without addressing any arguments. They will tell you that simply because you are starting to feel and think differently, it is automatically wrong. In order for WT to survive, you have be a robot, programmed exactly how they want you.

They will gaslight you and tell you that there isn't anything else out there that resembles what apparently 'you know' about the Bible. Well ask yourself - who taught you what you know about the Bible? You did not teach yourself - everything you know has been fed to you by WT. They will tell you that if you use Jehovah's name you will have this productive ministry with amazing joy - not sure what planet they live on but every JW I know, if not hates, absolutely dreads the ministry. Everyone just thinks about the coffee break - so much for lifesaving work in God's name!

To summarise, this video is yet another example of manipulation and gaslighting tactics used by Watchtower to make Jehovah's Witnesses fall into the line. Rather than address the reasons for people leaving or having doubts, they bury their heads in the sand, and focus on demonising the act of leaving the organisation as something wicked and bad. This further instills guilt and shame into people who have genuine, sincere concerns and questions about the organisation, and completely dismisses them.",26,1745511383.0,exjw,3,0.94,False

Hi everyone,

I've now been out of my house for 6 months due to the presence of black mold. This exposure has led to several health issues, and after a lot of research and two nose surgeries, I discovered that I've developed **histamine intolerance**. This could either be genetic or triggered by prolonged exposure to mold. Here's what I've learned over these months and how I'm managing it:

1. **Histamine Intolerance** It turns out that my body struggles with histamine, and the symptoms I experience ‚Äî such as swollen turbinates in my nose, acid reflux, post-nasal drip, and anxiety ‚Äî are all related to this intolerance. I'm still figuring out the best way to manage it.
2. **Diet and Managing Histamine** In an effort to balance my histamine levels, I've started a strict diet, mainly eating meat from the butcher and an avocado before meals to maintain B6 production. This helps, but there's a problem. Whenever I try this diet or fast for a period, I experience constipation, which worsens my histamine reactions. The constipation leads to even more severe symptoms, such as increased nasal swelling and acid reflux.
3. **Caffeine as a Solution** I've added coffee to my routine, and surprisingly, it helps with constipation. After having a bowel movement, I notice a reduction in swelling in my nose, which indicates that a lot of my symptoms are likely stemming from issues in my stomach and digestion.
4. **Fasting Considerations** I considered doing a water fast, but after some thought, I believe it would do more harm than good for me right now. Since I've been dealing with these stomach issues, I probably have some vitamin deficiencies, and fasting could make this worse in the short term. I‚Äôm sticking with the anti-histamine diet for now and seeing how my body responds.
5. **Looking Ahead** I‚Äôm not sure if long-term water fasting would be the answer, but I‚Äôm planning to stick with this diet for a longer period before exploring other options. I would love to hear if anyone has experience with histamine intolerance, black mold exposure, or long-term fasting in cases like mine.

Thanks for reading, and I‚Äôm open to any advice or similar experiences!",0,1745511372.0,ibs,1,0.5,False

I am a 37 year old female. I am creative, introspective, and enjoy meaningful conversations - the kind that go from light to deep, effortlessly. I love design, good coffee, long walks (preferably by the beach), and the occasional impromptu road trip.

What am I looking for? Someone who is emotionally engaged, kind, curious about life, and has a slightly dry or sarcastic sense of humor.

I don't like to disappear, play games, or exchange selfies all day - I value emotional intelligence and giving. A well-thought-out message always gets my attention.

If you are looking for a true friendship, please leave me a message, üòä",5,1745511369.0,Needafriend,5,0.86,False
