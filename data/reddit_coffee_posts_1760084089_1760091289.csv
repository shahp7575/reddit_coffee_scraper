1o2wyt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o2wyt2/am_i_the_ah_for_making_my_relationship_with_my/,Am I the AH for making my relationship with my family fall apart?,"Sorry if there's any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

For context: I (30) have been living in another country for almost 7 years. I moved to another country because of 2 of my aunts (let's call them Claire (the oldest) and Elsa (the youngest))that convinced me to move here (they've been living is the country for a few years) so I could try to build a more stable life, then in my hometown. Well, their personalities while in our hometown and on vacation, are completely different than the ones they show where they live. I trusted and liked the vacation personality of them, so I trusted them and moved. For the first months, I lived with one of my aunts, and after a few days, a rift started to build up between us, because we started seeing that our personalities don't align, we don't have much in common, and slowly but surely, I started to feel alone (this is my perspective of the things, they have another perspective).  
When I moved to my own apartment, it's when I realized that they never called, never visited... The only time they came was to complain because of work... Note that I moved to a country where I needed to learn a new language, while at work (speaking English was not an option).  
  
Back in that time, I had a boyfriend that also moved to this country, but things didn't work out and we went our separate ways after 2 or 3 years together in here.  
  
While I was working in the production system, I met a person, that later opened a restaurant and asked me if I wanted to work with him. Since gastronomy is part of my area of study, I left the production fabrics behind and we started working together. Between us, at some point, feeling started to grow, and we started dating, but because of how distant my relationship with my family is, I never officially presented him as being my boyfriend. So we kept a secret. Now I recognize, that he was very manipulative and obsessive, so much so that he wanted to control my phone all the time, he wanted to know where I go, with whom, why, and so on... I kinda had a blind eye for all of that, because at the beginning of the relationship everything is new, and everything can be excused. But slowly, slowly, boundaries started to be crossed. I was in a very bad shape, I was deeply depressed, he was pressuring me all the time (either I was too much, or not enough), and I had no one to turn to, so I turned to self-harm, in hope of relieving the psychological pain. 3 years go by, and I'm still in this manipulative relationship: experiences that I wanted to have for myself (like concerts) ruined because of him, and by him making the whole day about himself; gaslighting about anything and everything... 

Last week, Elsa's boyfriend (let's call him Mark, and Mark and Elsa have been together for years now) asked me for a small favour. Well, I'm very aware that if I ever came here is because Mark got me the first job to begin with. And I'm very appreciated for that so of course I helped. While helping him with this favour (just driving him to the new job, because he would get the company car that day), we were talking and he felt that I wasn't in my best shape, specially psychologically speaking, so he offered to take a coffee so I could talk to him as in ranting. I see him like the closest of what I have as a father figure here, so I accepted. I told him about my secret relationship and begged him to not tell anyone because I was not sure if I could see a future in it, and he kept it a secret (important for later).

We had our coffee yesterday evening. Everything was going fine until my boyfriend started calling me non-stop. Tho, I rejected all the calls and even gave an excuse that I was talking with my parents and would call when I could, he kept harassing me. Mark saw how distressed it made and he, having a daughter the same age as me (from a previous marriage) obviously started getting worried, because he also sees me as a daughter. I told my boyfriend, please leave me alone, I have a lot to process and need some time for myself. Mark brings me home, and hold and behold my boyfriend is at my house, waiting for me outside. Mark was worried about me and tried to intervene, because of the way my boyfriend was starting to manipulate me. I tried to end the relationship then and there, I grabbed the few stuff he had at my house, gave it back and thought that would be the end of it. My boyfriend starts to create a drama, where all my neighbours could hear (and that was already at 11/12p.m.) . Mark, worried about my safety, offered to drive me to Elsa's place, so I could sleep there and not be harassed by my (now ex) boyfriend. Elsa wakes up to go to work at 5a.m., so going to her place, so late at night, I thought it would wake her up and scared the shitting hell out of her, and maybe would not be the better idea. So Mark, thought it would be better to go to his place instead, anything but my place to avoid the guy. While Mark was sleeping in the sofa, I couldn't sleep the whole night.

In the morning, when Mark tries to leave me home, my ex was still here, waiting for me to come back. Later on, we get to know that he (my ex) talked the whole night with Elsa (I don't even know how he got his number) and he even tried to message my mom via Facebook. I get today morning 2 voice messages from Elsa, blaming me for everything that happened yesterday, the now problem between she and Mark (because looks like Mark didn't told her that he would go take a coffee with me - but I still don't know how is that my fault), blaming me for him keeping secrets from her (when the only secret I asked was just the relationship), and she doesn't even let me explain to her anything. She just took what my ex-boyfriend told her as being the absolute truth, a total stranger to her, instead of her own boyfriend or niece.

So, am I the AH, in this scenario? How can I try to mend something so broken from the beginning? 

P.S.: I also got a call from my parents to talk to me about the Facebook messages, that's how I learned about it, and because they didn't knew about the relationship, I had to rearrange a bit the story. But nonetheless, my parents are the ones trying to make me go to the infinity and beyond to make amends to someone who doesn't even let me speak to her.",1,1760091219.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

[China’s New Rare Earth and Magnet Restrictions Threaten U.S. Defense Supply Chains](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains)

[Photo: Mike Mareen\/Adobe Stock](https://preview.redd.it/itlnon3679uf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=374974e1413e668cf86edbb942da066f1e4c6a04)

In advance of President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to South Korea later this month—where he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time since 2019—China announced that it has expanded its restrictions on rare earth and permanent magnet exports. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s [Announcement No. 61 of 2025](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html) implements the strictest rare earth and permanent magnet export controls to date. The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting U.S. efforts to bolster its industrial base.

**Q1: What is new about today’s rare earth and permanent magnet export restrictions?**

**A1:** The new export controls mark the first time China has applied the foreign direct product rule (FDPR)—a mechanism introduced in [1959](https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-fdpr-why-is-us-using-it-cripple-chinas-tech-sector-2022-10-07/) and long used by Washington to restrict [semiconductor exports](https://www.ft.com/content/2334d3d9-d744-4d1f-94cc-e328968b41ce) to China. The FDPR enables the United States to regulate the sale of foreign-made products if they incorporate U.S. technology, software, or equipment, even when produced by non-U.S. companies abroad. In effect, if U.S. technology appears anywhere in the supply chain, Washington can assert jurisdiction.

Under the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export magnets that contain even trace amounts of Chinese-origin rare earth materials—or that were produced using Chinese mining, processing, or magnet-making technologies. The new licensing framework will apply to foreign-produced rare earth magnets and select semiconductor materials that contain at least [0.1 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/china-rare-earth-exports.html) heavy rare earth elements sourced from China.

Given China’s [dominance](https://www.ft.com/content/c4b2c5d9-c82f-401e-b763-bc9581019cb7) in the sector—accounting for roughly 70 percent of rare earth mining, 90 percent of separation and processing, and 93 percent of magnet manufacturing—these developments will have major national security implications.

**Q2: What do the new restrictions mean for the defense and semiconductor industries?**

**A2**: Rare earths are crucial for various [defense technologies](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/#:~:text=The%20F%2D35%2C%20for%20instance,class%20submarine%20needs%209%2C200%20pounds.), including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The United States is already struggling to keep pace in the production of these systems. Meanwhile, China is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms and equipment at a rate estimated to be [five to six times faster](https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/) than that of the United States.

The newly announced restrictions represent China’s most consequential measures to date targeting the defense sector. Under the new rules, starting December 1, 2025, companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries—including those of the United States—will be largely denied export licenses. The Ministry of Commerce also made clear that any requests to use rare earths for military purposes will be automatically rejected. In effect, the policy seeks to prevent direct or indirect contributions of Chinese-origin rare earths or related technologies to foreign defense supply chains.

Even before these latest measures, the U.S. defense industrial base [faced significant challenges](https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/) and had limited production capacity and limited ability to rapidly scale to meet rising defense technology needs. The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the [capability gap](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) and allowing China to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the United States at a time when tension is rising in the Indo-Pacific region.

Additionally, export license applications for rare earth materials used in highly advanced technologies, including sub-14-nanometer semiconductors, next-generation memory chips, semiconductor manufacturing or testing equipment, will now be subject to case-by-case review by Chinese authorities. Companies will likely need to provide detailed documentation on end users, technical specifications, and intended applications before any export is authorized. The individualized review process gives Chinese authorities significant discretion to delay, deny, or condition exports, effectively introducing a new layer of strategic control over the global supply of rare earth inputs critical to advanced computing and defense technologies.

**Q3: How is China tightening control over the outflow of its skills and technologies?**

**A3:** Under the new measures, Chinese nationals are barred from engaging in or providing support for overseas projects involving rare earth exploration, extraction, processing, or magnet manufacturing unless they first obtain explicit authorization from Chinese authorities. By tightening control over the movement of expertise, China aims to prevent the outflow of proprietary technologies and know-how that have made it the global leader in rare earth mining and magnet production. These restrictions build on the [rare earth processing technology export ban](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means) in December 2023.

**Q4: Why are the new export restrictions likely a negotiation tactic?**

**A4:** In its [announcement](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html), the Ministry of Commerce stated that China remains open to enhancing communication and cooperation with other countries through both multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues. The ministry emphasized that such dialogue seeks to promote compliant trade while protecting the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.

**Q5: How do these restrictions build on China’s earlier rare earth export controls?**

**A5:** The new measures mark a sharp escalation in Beijing’s long-running strategy to weaponize its dominance in rare earths. China [announced ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means)a ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies on December 21, 2023. On April 4, 2025, the Ministry of Commerce [introduced](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) export restrictions on seven rare earth elements in retaliation for President Trump’s new tariffs on Chinese goods.

Subsequent diplomacy offered only a temporary reprieve. During the May 11 [talks](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access) in Switzerland, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, which included removing U.S. companies from China’s trade blacklist and restoring their access to rare earth supplies. Yet stability proved short-lived: U.S. manufacturers soon began shutting down production amid ongoing shortages, as China delayed the issuance of export licenses despite not formally abandoning the deal. Tensions flared again when President Trump accused Beijing of backtracking on its commitments. Ultimately, on June 11, 2025, following two days of negotiations in London attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, both sides [reached](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access) a new trade framework—but the episode underscored how Beijing’s rare earth policy has evolved into a potent instrument of economic and geopolitical leverage.

**Q6: What is the United States doing to build its rare earth and permanent magnet capabilities to reduce China’s leverage?**

**A6:** Noveon Magnetics is currently the only manufacturer of rare earth magnets in the United States. This week, Noveon Magnetics and Lynas Rare Earths announced a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic partnership focused on building a scalable, domestic supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets in the United States.

In July 2025, as part of a landmark agreement, the Department of Defense (recently renamed the Department of War) invested $400 million in equity into MP Materials, making the U.S. government the company’s largest shareholder. The deal also includes a 10-year price floor commitment of $110 per kilogram for MP Materials’ NdPr (neodymium-praseodymium) products, designed to protect the commercial viability of the company amidst low prices stemming from Chinese overproduction. Additionally, the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has extended a $150 million loan to expand MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, California, facility, adding heavy rare earth separation capabilities to strengthen domestic processing capacity. MP Materials has also announced plans to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing facility, known as the “10X Facility.” The Department of War has entered into a 10-year offtake agreement for 100 percent of the facility’s magnet output. It will take time to ramp up these capabilities. Until then, China retains a significant amount of leverage over supply chains crucial for national and economic security.

# Oct. 9th, 2025~China Tightens Rare Earth Export Controls, Targeting U.S. Defense and Semiconductor Firms Ahead of Trump-Xi Talks

[China Tightens Rare Earth Export Controls, Targeting U.S. Defense and Semiconductor Firms Ahead of Trump-Xi Talks](https://www.btimesonline.com/articles/175569/20251009/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-targeting-us-defense-and-semiconductor-firms-ahead-of-trump-xi-talks.htm)

https://preview.redd.it/e4s9ugtc99uf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=094c49d0cb48d6751097b935847fb2fe3d7fbd55

China moved Thursday to expand its control over the global rare earth supply chain, announcing new export restrictions that target foreign defense contractors and semiconductor manufacturers and adding five more rare earth elements to its list of controlled materials. The decision, unveiled by the Ministry of Commerce, escalates Beijing's strategic use of critical minerals just weeks before a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

**The new regulations tighten export licenses for rare earths and related refining technologies, a step analysts say is designed to increase Beijing's leverage ahead of high-stakes trade talks. ""This helps with increasing leverage for Beijing ahead of the anticipated Trump-Xi summit in South Korea later this month,"" said Tim Zhang, founder of Singapore-based Edge Research.**

China produces more than 90% of the world's processed rare earths and rare earth magnets, which are essential to manufacturing products ranging from electric vehicles and smartphones to jet engines and precision-guided military weapons. **The Ministry of Commerce said exports of holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium-all vital for advanced chips and radar systems-will now require government approval, bringing the total number of restricted rare earths to 12 elements.**

Under the new rules, foreign companies using Chinese rare earth materials or equipment will also be required to obtain Chinese export licenses-even if no Chinese firm is involved in the final transaction. The ministry said overseas defense users will be denied licenses entirely, while applications tied to semiconductors and artificial intelligence with potential military use will be reviewed case by case.

This signals ""a deliberate effort to strengthen China's bargaining position,"" said Dan Wang, China director at the Eurasia Group. ""By demonstrating China can calibrate controls, Beijing is showing a new level of confidence and sophistication."" Wang added that the policy could serve as a model for China's management of other strategic commodities such as cobalt and graphite, turning resource dominance into ""a diplomatic lever.""

The ministry's statement framed the move as a national security measure, accusing ""foreign organizations and individuals"" of transferring Chinese-origin rare earths or technologies to ""sensitive sectors such as the military."" It said such activities ""have caused significant harm or posed potential threats to China's national security and interests.""

The timing of the restrictions-effective November 8 for new materials and equipment, and December 1 for foreign firms using Chinese inputs-aligns closely with the expiration of a 90-day U.S.-China trade truce. The rules come as U.S. lawmakers call for broader bans on exports of chipmaking equipment to China, deepening a tit-for-tat technology confrontation between the two economies.

Beijing's latest actions also revive memories of April's export clampdown, which created a global supply shortage before China struck limited supply agreements with Europe and the United States. The Ministry of Commerce said Thursday the scope of its new restrictions would remain ""limited"" and that ""a variety of licensing facilitation measures will be adopted"" to maintain some supply stability.

Shares of Chinese rare earth producers surged after the announcement, with China Northern Rare Earth Group jumping 10%, China Rare Earth Resources and Technology gaining nearly 10%, and Shenghe Resources rising 9.4%.

The restrictions' impact is expected to be felt most acutely in defense and semiconductor manufacturing. The ministry said the new export approval process would cover chips at 14-nanometer nodes or more advanced, memory chips with 256 layers or higher, and AI applications with dual-use military potential.

South Korea's Ministry of Industry said it is reviewing the measures with Chinese authorities to minimize disruptions to firms like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, both major consumers of rare earths. Taiwan's TSMC, which uses similar materials in high-performance chip fabrication, reported that it was still assessing the implications.

**Analysts say the move cements China's willingness to weaponize its dominance over strategic raw materials as economic competition with Washington intensifies. ""China's dominance in resource and related tech will become a new choke point for global business,"" Wang said.**

The Ministry of Commerce's announcement also included a warning that any foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare earths for military use abroad could face penalties under its unreliable entities list, which already includes several U.S. defense firms. Beijing added that these actions ""undermined China's national sovereignty, security, and development interests.""

**Washington needs a strategy to secure America’s critical minerals supply that balances onshoring through domestic mining and offshoring through international supply chain development.**

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.

# 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 ~BELOW~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!  ""Staying Tuned!""....

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

[See for yourself](https://preview.redd.it/hior53xya9uf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a7f6278f83f3a51a8f510956bedaa0f29bc86e7)

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

# 🚨 NIOCORP — DRILL RESULTS DUE ANY DAY NOW! (Mid–Late Oct 2025) 🚨

**IMHO- Get ready —** the next catalyst window has opened. NioCorp’s expanded drill program (9 infill + 6 step-outs) could confirm a \~1,000,000 tonne TREO resource, lifting every core metal — Nb, Sc, Ti, and REEs — into a new valuation bracket. Mid–late October assay drops align perfectly with the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study, making this the most leveraged U.S. critical-minerals play of 2025!

**Following the Munich-to-Washington handoff**, CEO Mark Smith declared Elk Creek **a “U.S. National Security Asset” — then took that message straight to J.P. Morgan’s Export Finance Forum**. Institutional bids, defense-linked capital, and agency lenders (EXIM + DFC) are now circling as Sc-Al alloy integration for Gen VI fighters quietly moves into classified development under a DoD prime. November’s Scandium Metal Unveiling under DoD oversight is the next confirmed waypoint.

**Policy × Geology × Finance = Convergence**. The Trump administration’s new Critical Minerals Directive has flipped the switch on price floors and direct U.S. equity stakes. EXIM and DFC funding tracks are hot, Maxim’s $12 target is live, and U.S. defense procurement is moving fast to lock in mine-to-magnet-to-missile supply chains. Elk Creek is shovel-ready, fully permitted, and now officially mission-aligned.

# 🧭 Bottom Line:

# 🔥 “More Core = More Ore.”

# NioCorp’s 2025 drill campaign wasn't just routine — it’s transformative. The 2022 Feasibility Study locked in 632,000 tonnes TREO, but this year’s 9 new infill holes + 6 step-outs could push that toward ~1,000,000 tonnes, proving Elk Creek’s resource is bigger, richer, and more continuous than ever modeled. More core means tighter geological confidence, expanded mine life, and the potential to scale up every strategic metal output! — Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and REEs — just as U.S. defense, aerospace, and EV sectors scramble for secure domestic supply. In short: the 2025 drill results could rewrite the project’s economics and reprice the entire company.

# ""Elk Creek as a “U.S. National Security Asset"" moment has arrived — and the ignition window is wide open. 🛰️⚡""

I’m in my early 30s and really happy living in Chiang Mai. I work online, enjoy cooking at home or eating out sometimes, during weekends I love exploring new areas and nice coffee shops in nature. Life here is great overall, I’ve got some friends but the only thing I’m struggling with is meeting someone to date.

I’m not into the party lifestyle or casual stuff, just looking for a normal relationship. I used to live in Bangkok and it was much easier to meet people there. I actually had a Thai girlfriend for the two years I lived there.

Here in Chiang Mai it feels like girls are more traditional or just not that interested in dating foreigners. Dating apps don’t seem to work well here so I ended up deleting all of them 🤣

Do you guys have any tips or recommendations?

My Thai isn’t good to be honest. I can manage some basic conversations but not well enough for a proper conversation. I’m trying to improve it taking Thai classes three times a week.

I never took any guy serious or even considered a coffee date...but then I saw his profile with that kind face, and well...We met online, met up after a month of chatting. At our second date i admitted I was still technically married, since i'm still in the process of divorce. He then also admitted, like someone super relieved to share a huge secret, that he was still married. It was at our third date I learnt that they were still living together. That should have been the end of it...

BUT he exuded such calm confidence...and a great sense of humour...something in me was enchanted with this kind handsome man and his adoration of me, his absolute focus on me and my feelings...making me feel so safe and seen. I would say my biggest ick at that stage was when we used to chat in the car after dates and i told him im tired he would acknowledge what i said but just keep talking and talking and I even fell asleep a few times. also, the posturing - sometimes i caught him fake smouldering..? like pulling in his tummy as he's leaning back in his seat, manspreading...it's embarassing to admit now that i noticed it but didnt realise that such fake behavious is actually a red flag. I just thought it was kinda goofy.

EDIT he eventually finalised his divorce almost 5 years later whereas my divorce was finalised within that year.

Fast forward to today more than 10 years later and hes crossed so many boundaries, while taking every opportunity to shine without actually being the partner that I needed. made so many promises...taken so much from me and yet hasnt invested anything substantial into me or my aspirations, reciprocally. The list is too long to type out and frankly it gives me anxiety to recall these events.

He's never violent, but the potential for violence is always implied. and with my history of not-so-good male influences in my life i also fawned quite a bit, however unknowingly...so i've stayed...because im still waiting on him to make good on his promises, to actually put a ring on my finger...and for all the real assets and opportunities that i've had to give up in order to reach our ""goal"" of buying a big enough house for our blended family. he's like the funny uncle, never actually engaging with the kids on a fatherly level...its quite sad to see as i truly value the relationship i have with my kids...id say his best relationship is with my 23yo daughter whos known him since shes 9 and really taken him as a father figure...though from my pov i can really see even that pure relationship is very one sided...unfortunately ive been to good an example of being happy with the bare minimum.

as im typing this im ready to go but sadly as a 45yo woman i am scared of being alone and making it on my own...even though I am extremely good at what I do (self employed) and do have money (even if just enough, because one thing he does is to avoid parenting or chores so i barely have time for my business, actively suffocating my source of income).

Thinking about starting over makes my stomach turn and i already feel like running for the loo. I cant sleep and my body feels like its in a vice grip at all times...I gave myself a timeline of breaking up with him in the next 2 weeks...I hope i have the strength to see it through",1,1760090163.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

I want to leave my country for few years. Sadly the pandemic came and I couldn't continue with my planning. At the beginning of this year I started looking into possible countries to move to. A coworker advised me to think about the states.

  
First a few things about me: I'm (35y, female) currently living in germany. I have no kids (and no plans), nor a partner. I did my training as an IT specialist for system integration. During the pandemic I did my bachelor in business information systems, while working full time. I worked 8 years as a sap administrator. Currently I'm working as a software license manager. When I'm not working, I like to play video games, crochet or read. At the weekend I like to spend time with my family or friends. I'm not a party girl or need a lot of action. I'm happy with 2-3 friends to go shopping, drinking a coffee or watching a movie. My biggest wish is to have my own cat. I also would like to buy a house, but that is not my highest priority. I also love nature and would like to move somewhere, where its green and I have the option to go on a walk or drive my bicycle. Overall I want a basic life-work-balance.

For possible states I looked into Maine and Wisconsin, because of work-life-balance and nature, but I'm open about it. A lot of it depend of job opportunities. Another factor, that is important to me, is health care. I don't mean insurance, but rather is it available. I don't want to wait 1 year for a doctors appointment, when I pay for it. How is it in the states?

Another thing I would like to know about are retirement plans. How do americans do it? 

Currently I'm just planing of moving and will take my time, before I make a decision. Next year I plan to go on vacation to the states. It would be nice knowing some people or having connections in advance. :D

I would also like some experience from other european. Positiv and negative. The perfect country doesn't exist. :) What are things I should think carefully about? If I forgot something, don't hesitate to ask. I'm already happy, when some people would give me a bit of advice or share their experience. :)

The issues with RAG is that it is fetching non similar data and it is fetching lot of unwanted data. Also there is a limitation of context length. 

So I'm planning to fine tune llama 3.1 on my data. And if i ask any question related to that data it should give me the answer like if i say i want to buy a flat in marathalli then it should give me the project names.

I have two options to fine tune. one is supervised FT where i give question answer pairs and other unsupervised FT which is a next token prediction or CLM.

This is how my data look like

1o2wjye,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1o2wjye/whats_the_hardest_part_about_sending_small/,"What’s the hardest part about sending small, thoughtful gifts online to friends?","I’ve been thinking about how we send small, everyday gifts — not birthdays or big occasions, but those little “coffee on me” or “you got this” moments.

Whenever I try to do it **online**, it feels surprisingly awkward.  
Most sites only offer **generic vouchers for big brands**, which feel impersonal. Food delivery or courier options are overkill for a $5 treat. And local cafés or shops rarely have a quick “send to a friend” button online. So usually I just end up sending a message instead of an actual gift.

I’m curious how others handle this.

* Do you ever try to send small gifts digitally?
* What usually stops you — cost, hassle, lack of easy tools, or something else?
* Would you use a simple way to send small local treats online, or is that not really your thing?

We went into conversations about or lives when she was still together with my dad and when I was living with them as a teenager. (They separated 10 years ago)

I knew at least that within the last two years of their relationship my dad had been cheating om my mum with other women,(even though he never admitted to it despite numerous evidence)

I thought it was the last couple years, but no. My mum told me for the first time that a few years before I was born he cheated on my mum then with a married woman. But they decided they would try and get through it and mend the relationship after.

If only my mum smelled the coffee then and dumped his cheating scummy arse a lot of shit could have been avoided. Me and my brother wouldn't have been born but given living under his roof meant being on the receiving end of his physical and verbal abuse and constant shouting with his undressed anger issues i don't think I'd care.

Also mum wouldn't be led on by a man for 25 years, cheated on again and again and not even marry her because he 'didn't believe in marriage' only to marry another woman 3 years after then formally separated.

Then my mum also told me for the first time last week how my dad spread rumors about mum when they broke up. Telling people my mum turned lesbian and kicked him out of the house. When in actual fact he left on his own acord. 

He was always lapping as a victim while minupuating everyone and everything around him.

1o2we41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1o2we41/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1o2w6mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o2w6mh/upgrading_advice_from_sage_2000euro/,Upgrading advice from Sage [2000euro],"Around 3 years ago I gave espressos a better try during my vacation. After trying some in coffee bars, with varying results, I got hooked on the espresso journey. After getting home, I started doing some research, I settled on a Sage (Breville) Barista Express Impress. My reasoning for this was that I tought that with the little experience I had, getting rid of the tamping process would make my journey easier. Well boy was I wrong. I had some inmense struggles getting the build-in grinder set up. And every time I bought new beans, it was a struggle again. So after around 6 months I bought a DF64 and have not used the build-in grinder ever since. What a relief and upgrade the DF64 made.

Now 2 years later, I am wondering if selling my Sage for a better machine is worth it. I did some research what would fit my needs. I am not a hardcore connaisseur, but I would like to do 1 more upgrade and have that be my end-game machine. (Or have it last at least  5-10 years, which I need to convince my wife I do need a better machine again). I am in need of some advice, as my research got me lost with the options.

My first selection was a Profitec Pro 500, but after doing more research I understand that temperature monitoring on the boiler is not preferred. Could you advice me in better options for around a 2000 euro budget (located in the Netherlands)?

I use the machine mainly for Espressos, I do not like milk drinks. However I would like to have the option to make milk drinks when necessary. I would like a pre-infusion option, flow control and temperature stability.",1,1760088317.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Think about it: a post about getting a free coffee probably won’t get half as many upvotes as a rant about being ignored by the barista for 10 minutes.

* **Relatability:** People love to say, “I’ve been there too!” Negative experiences create instant connections.
* **Negativity bias:** Humans are wired to pay more attention to problems than perks.

1o2w4y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1o2w4y5/does_my_coworker_secretly_hate_me_for_no_reason/,Does my coworker secretly hate me for no reason? :(,"Hello! to preface, I work in a fashion retail store and i'm a visibly/out queer 24NB person diagnosed with auDHD and anxiety/depression. my other coworkers are 30F (manager), 24M (assistant manager), 25F, 22F, and 29M (other salespeople like me). I get along perfectly fine with everyone. We're not besties who talk all the time but we work together fine, complete our tasks, and make some silly chill convo when there's no customers. Everyone other than the 29M, James, who acts very weird around me. I'm the newest person in the store as of now but i've been there for 3 months. He's been there since last December so a bit less than a year. 
I don't mask, and everyone including him knows i'm queer and neurodivergent (4 of the others are also gay/lesbian, James is cishet) but I don't think this is the problem they all talk normally with James and make jokes with him. 
At first I thought it might have to do with me being new and needing to get to know him but be straight up never talks to me, and every time I do try to talk to him he either answers bluntly, makes no attempt to continue the conversation, or flat out tells me to ""walk away from him"". He might show something on the work monitor or on his phone to someone else and when I walk to look as well he hides the screen. When he thinks I do something wrong (which is 99% of the time a misunderstanding after I explain it to him) he instantly gets angry and goes on to blame me. 
When I ask him about how to do something he looks at me irritated and says something along the lines ""what do you mean, you should already know that"" (which is against what our manager has told every one of us). Lately he's been more and more adamant about me ""leaving him alone"". 
I suck severely at being social and my skills in that regard are very regressed however I in no way think i'm being annoying towards him. I've only attempted to talk to him like 3-5 times with a bit of success but his tone always seemed blunt and judgemental.
The weirdest thing is that he's also helped me when I've had an anxiety attack, and asked me if I want food or coffee and brought me some bought with his own money numerous times, so I have no idea what his feelings are towards me. I'd be inclined to believe that his ""good"" actions are just social niceties just so the other coworkers can't realise he hates me, but otherwise as someone too autistic to read people and their intentions, he's genuinely baffling to me. 
At first I thought that in general, he was joking and I tried to pass his behavior off as just cishet guy ""humor"", considering I've never had many male friends so I have no idea how they act lol.
Like I said above, he's good with everyone else who works here and makes perfectly normal conversation with them but when he's with me he acts irritated, gives me zero help when it comes to customer service, and doesn't attempt to talk to me. 
There's even many instances where his friends have come over and he's always smiling and hugging them.
Considering he's resigning in 2 months, I don't really care in the long run but until then, our interactions make me lowkey uncomfortable :/
I also have zero clue how and if I have to bring this up to him since his behavior and personality makes it clear that there's no reason for us to be friends, making me think I shouldn't attempt this.
Does it sound like he dislikes me or is it just his personality??

1o2vtek,https://www.reddit.com/r/BisexualTeens/comments/1o2vtek/story_time_about_my_tragic_wuhluhwuh/,story time about my tragic wuhluhwuh :(,"i haven't been able to get this out of my head recently. i just need somewhere to word-dump. also, this story, as the title suggests, doesn't have a happy ending... yet. but it might. one day. probably not, but a fella can dream.

so, a few years ago, there was this girl. i liked her - hell, from how i describe her, to this day, people say i'm in love with her, and they're probably right. but anyway, there was this girl. she made me realize that i don't just like guys.

well, i liked her for a year or two, then kinda told her indirectly. i said something along the lines of, ""remember this incredibly romantic moment we shared last month? i really liked you then."" and she said something like, ""oh, that's crazy, i liked you then too.""

so, for about a year, we had the most tragically romantic ""will-they, won't-they"" in wuhluhwuh history. one second, we were talking, and there would be this sort of pause where the silence stretched out, a tension thick enough to cut with the safety scissors we were given in class. and then we were talking again, like the silence itself didn't say everything we were too afraid to. wow, that was strangely poetic.

eventually, it got to a point where my crush on her became a running joke amongst our friend group, and her crush on me became a running joke too. and even eventually-er (?), it got to a point where she just said, ""i like you, i really do, but i don't think i'm ready to date another girl."" i completely understood, seeing as her family was incredibly religious and pretty strict.

the next year, almost immediately, she started dating a girl. she was a piece of total crap, and not in a petty way; she treated my friend like garbage, and i hated it. but every time that girl broke her heart, i was there, offering kindness as support. as long as my best friend was happy, i was happy. and if she wasn't happy, i did my best to fix that.

after a while, and a cheating scandal on my friend's part, they broke up. i don't think it actually happened, and that isn't because of rose-tinted glasses, it's because i knew her better than her girlfriend knew her, and she would never do that. but anyway, they broke up, and my friend started dating someone else. they broke up, and right before i had the chance to ask her out, she found someone new - the guy i had liked for just as long as i liked her.

the end-of-year dance rolled around, and her boyfriend no-showed. we spent the entire night together, until the moment the dance ended, and it felt a lot like a date - or, at least, it did on my part. we shared a coffee, same straw and everything because it really wasn't a big deal. she said, ""y'know, we've been friends for a long time, but we've never shared a drink. this feels kinda weird."" i said, ""it's only weird if we make it weird."" and then there was a kind of silence where everything was so loud - the music, the people - but at the same time, all i could hear was my heart beating in my ears, and all i could focus on was her smile. soft, a little shy, but genuine.

the rest of the night, we were normal, like nothing happened. like i wasn't five seconds away from begging in my hands and knees for a chance. like there was never any tension between us in those moments of loud silence.

i moved away after that year, and we weren't able to talk for a while. i reached out after a few months, and we talked for an hour or two. it's been over a year since i've seen her, and about a year since we last talked, but i'm back in our hometown. her birthday is soon. i might use that as an excuse to text her. i'm pretty sure i'm in love with the idea of what could've been more than i'm in love with her, but i still wanna reach out, let her know that i've missed her. idk tho, i might just cry into my pillow for a few days and pretend to move on like a totally healthy person would do (/j)",2,1760086912.0,BisexualTeens,1,1.0,False

Warning: This is a bit lengthy.

I'm 23, living in Manila, PH, and feeling a little young to seek advice on my job hunt in hospitality—but here I am. I recently graduated and finished my on-the-job training as a restaurant waiter and in hotel reservations, and it left me wondering, ""Am I the only English speaker around?""

The team I worked with at the hotel was super caring and outgoing, not so much at the resto, but anyhow, still exhausting as an introvert who'd dreamt of becoming a chef. The downside? My coworkers started sidelining me because I only speak English, not Filipino. During one job interview for a kitchen role, they even discouraged me, saying no one there would speak English with me.

Honestly, I have zero interest in learning Tagalog—no offense, just not interested (can a guy stick to coffee than tea?). Now I'm torn, Should I push on with hotel jobs, where the back office side feels more respectful?

I have been waiting to post here since the last 3 months. I gave my exam today and passed at 100. It was one of a kind exam and I thought I would flunk. 
Almost 70-80% of the questions had me thinking about the final answer after eliminating two options.

Firstly, I would like to thank the reddit community. I used to read every post which kept me motivated and gave me perspective. 

I have 7+ years of professional experience in AppSec and blue team ( mostly ddos stuff) and I also hold a master's degree in cyber security. 

I started my preparation in the mid of June. I couldn't study for a couple of weeks in between because of certain health issues in the family. 
I used the below resources to prepare( I won't rate them because I felt each of the resources helped me prepare in a way)

1. Started off with the linkedin course by Mike Chapple: this gave me an understanding of the syllabus and helped me set my mindset regarding the 8 domains
2. Read the OSG completely ( struggled initially but this book is a gold mine to build your tech knowledge and everything is in the book). I also re-read some chapters where I felt I can improve especially domain 3 and 4.
3. Official Practise Tests: Did all the 8 domains quiz and took all 4 practise tests( helps test your technical knowledge)
4. Learnzapp - similar to OPT questions (some questions were even the same) helped again on the tech front
5. How to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed : the first time I read the book, I was overwhelmed by the thought process and really helped me mould my mind 
6. Prabh Nair coffee shots: Really enjoyed the videos especially on those days when I had no energy to read, these videos kept me going and it is really a gold mine where it covers multiple topics
7. Destination certification App: I did almost 1800 questions from this app and it helped me setup my mindset for the exam. Great questions but after a point I was able to answer easily and get consistently 80% ( The app is a little buggy for Android but it does the job)
8. Inside Cloud and Security- All the videos on loop whenever I was free especially exam cram ( very good to revise)
9. Memory palace by Prashanth Mohan to revise
10.  One day before the exam - watched the Andrew Ramdayal top 50 cissp questions and Kelly handerhan's - ' Why you will pass the CISSP' video to set my mindset

I had purchased peace of mind protection and was planning on buying QE if I wasn't able to clear. Overall, the learning experience was very enriching and I got to learn a lot of new stuff. The questions on the actual exam were very different and a completely new experience to me. It was way difficult and also not similar to learnzapp or dest cert. 

It will more likely come down to the last two choices most of the times. Most of you had posted in this subreddit that you were feeling that you would not pass and then you received the congratulations letter. I can now totally understand how that felt.. it is also something that also kept me going while answering the questions.

In today’s fast-paced world, convenience, security, and energy efficiency have become essential elements of modern living. Smart homes, once a futuristic dream, are now a practical reality for homeowners in Kerala. From Kochi’s high-rise apartments to the serene villas of Wayanad, more and more people are embracing home automation in Kerala to simplify their lives while enhancing comfort and safety.



If you’re considering transforming your home into a smart haven but don’t know where to start, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about beginning your home automation journey in Kerala.



Why Smart Homes Are Gaining Popularity in Kerala



Kerala has always been a state known for its forward-thinking approach to lifestyle and technology. The rise of smart homes in the region is not just a trend—it’s a response to the growing need for convenience, efficiency, and security. Here’s why homeowners are increasingly investing in home automation in Kerala:



Convenience at Your Fingertips

Imagine controlling your lights, fans, air conditioning, and appliances without leaving your couch. Smart homes offer this level of convenience. Whether it’s turning off all the lights with a single voice command or scheduling your coffee machine to brew automatically, automation simplifies everyday tasks.



Energy Efficiency

Energy costs are a concern for many households. Smart lighting, thermostats, and energy-efficient appliances can drastically reduce electricity consumption. By automating energy usage based on real-time needs, homeowners save money while contributing to a greener environment—a perfect fit for Kerala’s eco-conscious lifestyle.



Enhanced Security and Safety

Smart locks, CCTV cameras, motion sensors, and automated alarms make homes safer. Parents, frequent travelers, and working professionals in Kerala are leveraging automation to monitor their homes in real-time, ensuring peace of mind even when away.



Future-Proofing Your Home

Smart homes are increasingly becoming a standard expectation in real estate. By investing in home automation in Kerala, you not only improve your quality of life but also increase the value of your property, making it more appealing to potential buyers in the future.



Getting Started with Home Automation in Kerala



Starting your smart home journey may seem daunting, but with a step-by-step approach, it can be simple and enjoyable. Here’s a detailed guide:



1. Identify Your Goals



The first step is to determine why you want a smart home. Are you primarily looking for convenience, energy efficiency, security, or a combination of these? Setting clear goals will help you choose the right devices and avoid unnecessary expenses.



For example:



If you’re focused on security, prioritize smart cameras, locks, and sensors.



If energy efficiency is your goal, invest in smart thermostats, lighting, and energy-monitoring systems.



For convenience, consider smart speakers, appliances, and home assistants.



2. Start Small and Scale Gradually



You don’t need to automate your entire home at once. Many homeowners start with one room or a few essential devices, such as:



Smart lighting for living rooms and bedrooms



Smart plugs to control appliances remotely



Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home



Once you’re comfortable, you can expand to include climate control, security systems, entertainment, and more. A gradual approach keeps costs manageable and allows you to understand the technology before making a full-scale investment.



3. Choose the Right Devices



The market for home automation is vast. Choosing the right devices ensures seamless integration and long-term satisfaction. Here are some key categories:



Smart Lighting: Control brightness, color, and schedules from your phone or voice assistant.



Smart Thermostats: Automatically adjust temperature for comfort and energy savings.



Smart Security: Cameras, motion detectors, and smart locks protect your home.



Smart Appliances: Refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, and even robotic vacuum cleaners can now be automated.



Home Entertainment: Smart TVs, speakers, and home theater systems can be controlled via apps or voice commands.



When selecting devices, ensure they are compatible with each other and with your chosen ecosystem (Google Home, Alexa, or Apple HomeKit) for a unified smart home experience.

4. Integration Is Key



One of the biggest advantages of a smart home is that devices can work together. Integration allows you to control multiple devices from a single platform. For example:



Set a “Good Morning” routine that opens blinds, starts the coffee maker, and plays your favorite music.



Create a “Leaving Home” mode that turns off all lights, locks doors, and activates security cameras.



In Kerala, professional home automation providers specialize in integrating devices to work seamlessly, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.



5. Security and Privacy Considerations



A smart home is only as secure as its network. Here are some tips for protecting your system:



Use a strong, unique Wi-Fi password.



Enable two-factor authentication for apps and devices.



Regularly update device firmware to patch security vulnerabilities.



Avoid connecting devices that aren’t from reputable brands.



Professional providers of home automation in Kerala also offer network security guidance and maintenance services to safeguard your system.



6. DIY vs. Professional Installation



Deciding whether to install smart devices yourself or hire a professional depends on your comfort level with technology.



DIY Installation: Ideal for small-scale setups or tech enthusiasts. Many devices are plug-and-play and come with clear instructions.



Professional Installation: Recommended for full-home automation, complex integrations, and long-term support. Kerala has several trusted companies offering consultation, installation, and after-sales support for home automation systems.



7. Maintenance and Upgrades



Smart homes require occasional maintenance, such as:



Updating software



Checking connectivity and network performance



Replacing devices as technology evolves



A scalable approach allows you to upgrade your smart home gradually without disrupting daily life.

1o2vnk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SmileSuch671/comments/1o2vnk9/voice_search_optimization_the_next_seo_frontier/,Voice Search Optimization: The Next SEO Frontier,"# Indroduction

The way people seek information is consistently evolving in this digital era. Now, instead of typing their queries, users are speaking their queries as a result of the growing use of voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. As a result of the additional use of voice search, Voice Search Optimization (VSO) is an important new aspect in increasing the visibility of your website. Voice search is not simply a trend, it is changing the actual way search engines understand intent and results.

# Why Voice Search Matters

Voice search is revolutionizing SEO for several reasons:

1. **Growing Usage:** Millions of people use voice assistants daily to find quick answers, navigate, and shop online. This means businesses that optimize for voice have a better chance of being discovered.
2. **Conversational Queries:** Voice searches are more natural and question-based — for example, “What’s the best digital marketing strategy in 2025?” rather than “best digital marketing strategy 2025.”
3. **Local Intent:** Most voice searches have local intent, like “digital marketers near me” or “best coffee shop in Palakkad.” This makes **local SEO** more important than ever.
4. **User Convenience:** Speaking is faster and more convenient than typing, especially on mobile devices.

 

# How to Optimize for Voice Search

To make your website voice-search friendly, focus on these key strategies:

# 1. Use Conversational Keywords

People speak differently than they type. Include **long-tail, natural-sounding keywords** that mimic real speech. For instance, instead of targeting “digital marketing trends,” use “What are the latest digital marketing trends in 2025?”

# 2. Optimize for Featured Snippets

Voice assistants often read answers from **Google’s featured snippets** (Position Zero). Write clear, concise answers to common questions related to your niche to increase your chances of appearing there.

# 3. Focus on Local SEO

Since many voice searches are local, make sure your **Google Business Profile** is complete and up to date. Include accurate contact information, location, and business hours.

# 4. Improve Website Speed and Mobile Friendliness

Voice search users are often on mobile devices. Ensure your site loads quickly and provides a seamless mobile experience. Use tools like **Google PageSpeed Insights** to test performance.

# 5. Create FAQ Pages

Include a **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** section using natural, question-based language. This helps search engines identify your content as relevant to voice queries.

# The Future of Voice Search

The way people search for information online is evolving faster than ever. Instead of typing queries, users are increasingly **speaking** to devices like **Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa**. Voice search has become an everyday habit — from checking the weather and finding nearby restaurants to shopping and controlling smart home devices

# Conclusion

Voice search is the frontier of SEO, not just the next trend in SEO. Because of the rise of smart devices and conversational AI, optimizing for voice is no longer optional, it is a necessity. By focusing on natural language, local intent and user experience, you will be able to ensure your brand is visible and relevant in a voice-driven future.",1,1760086285.0,u_SmileSuch671,0,1.0,False

**Hatch** is your personal AI career coach — built to help you land more interviews with less guesswork.

You upload your resume and a job description. Hatch tailors everything for you:

* A resume that matches the posting and sounds like you, not a robot.
* A cover letter that actually makes sense for the company.
* Interview feedback that’s usable, not vague.

No prompts, no templates, no “please rewrite this paragraph” loops.  
Just plug in what you have and Hatch does the rest.

# Why we built it

Most job tools make you do all the thinking.  
Most AI tools make you sound fake.

We wanted something that feels like having a career coach who:

* Knows how hiring actually works
* Speaks like a real human
* Costs less than a coffee

So we trained Hatch specifically for resumes, cover letters, and interviews — nothing else.

# Who it’s for

Hatch is for anyone who’s trying to *stand out* in a crowded job market:

* Students or grads looking for that first internship or full-time role
* Professionals who apply to a lot of jobs but hate tailoring each one
* People who just want job prep to take **minutes instead of hours**

# How it works

**1. Resume Tailor**  
Upload your resume and paste a job description. Hatch rewrites it to match the posting — optimized keywords, impact, and flow.

**2. Cover Letter Writer**  
Drop the same job description (or a new one). Hatch writes a full letter that sounds like you and ties your story to the company.

**3. Interview Coach**  
Practice real interview questions. Hatch breaks down your answers, shows what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve.

You can use it free (no credit card).  
Pro is $5/month for unlimited everything.

# Why join this subreddit

We build Hatch *with* users, not just *for* them.  
If you’ve got ideas, bug reports, or wild suggestions — post them here.

**TL;DR**  
Job prep without the guesswork.  
Sound human. Get hired faster.

Baarbara estate seems to make some of the most unique beans I've seen around. However, No matter how I try to make them, how many techniques I apply, how many changes I try to make, I just can't bring myself to like them. The ones I have tried are the Frozen Cherry (Both by Baarbara & Coffeeverse), Special Cherry (Coffeeverse) and the Honey Sundried (Potboiler). 

The Honey might be the normal processed one out of them all, but I found it very underwhelming nonetheless. Muted in almost every flavour profile.

The Frozen Cherries might be the best smelling coffee I could've ever experienced. It's still on my mind after 6 months. It makes a decent Iced Pourover, but as a warm drink it gives none of the flavour you smell, and tastes just.....normal. 

The Special Cherry is my most recent purchase, but damn. Look, maybe it's me. They did say winey finish, but it feels like I'm being waterboarded with red wine here. It's very bitter, very funky, and also very sweet which is so incredibly confusing. 

Sorry if it's all over the place, the frustration I'm facing is difficult to explain. I really, really wanna like them, and at this point I've just accepted that they ain't got me.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1760085039.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

So this is the Flux Workflow i use with Redux, Controlnet, Wildcards, Refiner, Detailer

As for my WAN workflow there is a section to randomize the style with different LoRA, appreciate it cause i'm able to train Flux LoRA in local instead of WAN.

AND, the big point why i still like Flux, is the Redux nodes, who allow a good img2img to get a character than Flux doesn't know. With the easy way to make Flux LoRA is a good point to me.

I suggest you to not use the same Flux model,  and to play with the value of ""feature weight"" in the Redux nodes.

In the exemple you see 2B by SDXL is really accurate, but thanks to Redux with only prompting ""2B from Nier Automata, she is drinking a coffee close to a river , her blindfold is on, outside,"" we can recognise 2B in Flux.  So again there is a strong style LoRA applied on this example, i don't use raw flux, taste and color ;)

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for almost four years. We’ve been long-distance for the past two, visiting each other every few months, though it’s been inconsistent. He’s always seemed like the most supportive, patient, and loving partner — or at least that’s what I believed.

We fought quite a bit, mostly over communication — he’d put his phone on Do Not Disturb for long periods and ignore my calls. I thought we were just going through normal long-distance struggles.
Recently, I found out that he’s been using Tinder and Bumble on and off for our entire relationship — not just once or twice like he first claimed, but for years. He paid for boosts and subscriptions, and he was also secretly spending money on OnlyFans. He told me he has a cuckold kink but was ashamed of it and didn’t know how to bring it up. When I found everything, he broke down crying, shaking, saying he was sorry, begging me not to leave, and telling me I’m the most important person in his life. But even after he said he wanted to be honest, I saw him going into the bathroom to delete emails while I was on his computer. I still found OnlyFans receipts he hadn’t wiped yet.

To make things worse, I had been helping support him financially — paying for his meals, his car insurance, his garage, his coffee — while he was secretly spending money on other girls online. It makes me feel used and incredibly stupid, even though he keeps saying none of this is my fault and that I didn’t deserve any of it.

Now that he’s been caught, he’s doing everything he can to win me back — cooking, cleaning, buying me food, doing everything I say, sharing all his passwords. He seems both sad and relieved, like he’s happy to no longer be hiding things. But I can’t stop asking myself: why couldn’t he do any of this before I found out?

Another thing that’s been bothering me — I found out he was watching content involving women who look like me and his ex. He claims it wasn’t because he misses her (they broke up six years ago), but that it was unconscious and stupid. Still, it feels like such a deep betrayal.

Our sex life was never great. I had pain during sex, so we didn’t do it much. He never pressured me and always told me he found me attractive — but emotionally, I felt like I was healing and falling more in love with him… only to find all of this out now.
Right now, I feel completely stuck. I can’t even leave him immediately even if I wanted to — I bought a non-refundable ticket to come visit him, and I’m not in my home country. He’s also supposed to attend my brother’s wedding with me, and he’s a groomsman. I just went on a trip with his mom and aunt, and it’s all too overwhelming to process or walk away from in this moment. Everything is so tangled and exhausting.

He says he wants to change. He seems genuinely sorry. He says he’ll do whatever it takes. But I’m completely lost. I don’t know if someone like this can truly change — or if I’m just holding onto a version of him that never really existed.

I know a lot of people will say I’m blind or foolish, but I guess what I’m asking is:
Is there any small chance he really means it and could change — or am I just dragging myself through more pain hoping for a person he’ll never be?

Any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR:
I (25F) have been in a 4-year long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (24M), whom I thought was loving and supportive. We had communication issues, but I chalked it up to long-distance struggles. Recently, I found out he’d been using dating apps and OnlyFans for most of our relationship, spending money on other women while I was helping support him financially. He admitted to having a cuckold kink he was ashamed to share. Even after claiming he wanted to be honest, he was still hiding things. Now that he’s been caught, he’s doing everything to win me back and seems both remorseful and relieved. I’m overwhelmed — I’m abroad visiting him, he's in my brother’s wedding, and everything feels tangled. I don’t know if he can truly change or if I’m clinging to a version of him that never existed.

I (22F) have been working with my company for about 5 years. Two years ago, I moved to a different city and was lucky enough to get a position with the same company here. I’ve grown really close to my coworkers — they’re all older and have always looked out for me since I’m the youngest on the team.

A few months ago, we had some new hires, and one of them — let’s call him George (22M) — joined. Funny thing is, he’s just two months younger than me. I’ll admit, I didn’t like him much at first (honestly can’t even remember why now), but that changed pretty quickly. He’s incredibly hardworking, sweet, and respectful toward everyone. Since we’re the only two younger people in the company, we naturally started talking more — during breaks, while working, etc.

Fast forward to mid-August: I was about to go on vacation, and everyone at work knew I’d be gone for a while. George seemed genuinely disappointed that I was leaving. When I was saying my goodbyes, he gave me a really long hug (he’s super tall, probably like 6'2 so it definitely stood out). He asked for my Instagram, and we started texting after that.

When I was traveling, he kept checking in — asking if I landed safely, commenting on my stories, saying he was happy I was having fun. After I came back, I got sick and couldn’t go to work for a bit, but he kept texting, asking if I was okay, if I needed anything, and even said he missed me.

When I finally returned to work a couple of weeks ago, something surprising happened. I was sitting in my office doing paperwork when George suddenly came in (it’s a keycard-only room, so not everyone can access it) — and he just *hugged me from behind*. I was a little stunned, but he seemed genuinely happy and said he missed me. Later that day, he hugged me again.

Since then, he’s been extra sweet — offering to buy me food from McDonald’s nearby, holding my hand a little too long when we high-five, and just overall being really kind and attentive. We’d been talking about meeting up for coffee or lunch, and finally agreed on Monday.

But last night, around 1 AM, he texted me asking if I wanted to hang out earlier instead — like, *this weekend.* He said we could go see a movie, grab some Asian food afterward, and even take photos together in a photo booth.

So now I’m a little confused. 😅

Is this just a friendly gesture, or does it sound like he’s actually interested in me? I really don’t want to misread the situation, especially since we work together. I’d love to hear what you all think — is this a crush, or just really close friendship energy?",2,1760084183.0,Advice,5,0.75,False
