So, my friends have all left the country for the summer, and it's been a bit quiet around here. I figured I'd reach out to see if there are any fellow loners or chill folks who might want to hang out this weekend.

We could grab some coffee, explore the city, watch a movie, or just vibe somewhere low-key. No pressure, just looking for some good company and maybe make a new friend or two.

I‚Äôm considering taking this course by Kaapi Machines and wanted to get your thoughts. It‚Äôs called the Intensive Crop to Cup Workshop and seems to offer a comprehensive deep dive into coffee, especially for someone looking to go beyond casual brewing.

I‚Äôm doing this purely to get better at making manual brews at home (mainly pour-over, AeroPress, moka pot, etc.). I‚Äôm not aiming to become a professional barista ‚Äî just want to level up my knowledge and technique.

Here are the details:

Workshop Title: Intensive Crop to Cup Workshop
Duration: 14 hours
Cost: INR 12,000 + Taxes

Workshop Content:
	‚Ä¢	Coffee history and coffee in India
	‚Ä¢	Green beans: origin, processing, grading, transportation & storage, roasting, blending
	‚Ä¢	Tasting and cupping
	‚Ä¢	Grinder calibration (espresso & manual brewing)
	‚Ä¢	Understanding the barista workstation
	‚Ä¢	Espresso basics
	‚Ä¢	Milk frothing & latte art
	‚Ä¢	Manual brewing

They also offer a shorter Barista Skills course:
	‚Ä¢	Duration: 7 hours
	‚Ä¢	Cost: INR 7,000 + Taxes
	‚Ä¢	Content: Coffee basics, roasting, blending, tasting, semi-auto machine calibration, espresso prep (dosing, grinding, tamping)

Has anyone here taken this course or something similar from Kaapi Machines? Is it worth it for a home brewer looking to go deeper into manual brewing techniques and overall coffee knowledge?

1me5u4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1me5u4y/review_of_spathe_botanicals/,Review of Spathe Botanicals,"A recent post brought my attention to Spathe Botanicals, prompting an immediate order because it seemed right up my alley and I‚Äôm always on the lookout for Canadian indies to support. 

He currently has four scents available, they‚Äôre all EDP and botanical/made without synthetic aroma chemicals (I love naturals and synthetics alike, but just as an fyi!). Shipping was extremely fast and everything came nicely packaged in non-plastic materials. The samples are atomizers, hallelujah! He follows IFRA standards and has his formulations approved by Health Canada, which is something this sensitive-skinned person appreciates. 

If you are a fan of Pineward, I think you will find something you like here! 

1. **Voyageurs** (*stewing vegetables, pine, maple candy*): don‚Äôt let the seemingly discordant list of notes scare you off, this is an amazing atmospheric. There is a fresh celery up front, along with a lovely mix of warm cooking herbs - yet somehow manages not to just smell like straight up soup. The pine is not harsh nor astringent but lends a distinctly late-summer-in-the-Canadian-temperate-forest element. This isn‚Äôt a cold, bracing coniferous smell, it‚Äôs leaves and needles and bark starting to dry out, but still warmed in the sun, as summer meets fall. There‚Äôs no overt maple, it just lends a perfect subtle sweetness to help add warmth. This feels like idealized camping - remote wilderness with a cozy cabin nearby, the sun setting, and a bowl of something simple but hearty on your lap. I‚Äôm highly considering full-sizing, the hit of nostalgia is incredible. 

2. **Colourblind** (*flowers, beeswax, honey*). If you like (strong!) florals and you like realistic beeswax, this is for you! I didn‚Äôt order this sample but Dyllan generously included it - I am very picky about the florals I wear because my tastes veer more to woods/spice/incense. This one has the loudest sillage of the four scents by a mile. It‚Äôs heady but not indolic, there‚Äôs rose in here but it has a lot of company - I‚Äôm just not great at identifying flowers. It isn‚Äôt overly sweet, the honey/beeswax comes through more as a subtle animalic to dirty the florals up a bit. There is something citric as well, I get whiffs of something like citronella that comes and goes. 

3. **Fugitives** (*burning incense, coffee, church pews*). So I blind full-sized this because I truly have no chill when it comes to churchy incense atmospherics, and I *was not disappointed*. This is 100/10. It opens with smooth smoky wood, with no hint of BBQ. The smoke settles (but doesn‚Äôt disappear) after the first few minutes to reveal the characters of the incense - resinous frankincense, myrrh, probably storax and benzoin - it truly smells like the thuribles at Catholic mass. There is also a prominent polished wood note, it‚Äôs unmistakable if you‚Äôve ever been in a church! Combined, it makes the scent compellingly realistic. The coffee is not obvious, but it‚Äôs there if you look for it - it adds extra earthiness and depth to everything rather than smelling like a cup of coffee in a church (lol).  I really think this is a true work of art, and yet so wearable. It doesn‚Äôt feel heavily dark or gothic, it‚Äôs not head-shoppy, it smells of old, sacred, familiar ritual. The sillage is close, you will smell amazing to anyone close to you but won‚Äôt overwhelm anyone with smoke! 

4. **Manitou** (*tobacco, cedar, sage, sweet grass, lavender, patchouli*). The perfumer has some M√©tis heritage, 50% of the core formula is sourced from Indigenous suppliers in Canada (presumably the four sacred medicines it contains), and he donates some proceeds to the Native Women‚Äôs Shelter in Montreal. This opens with a quick burst of lavender and then cedar tea follows closely behind (it‚Äôs fresh and dewy and sappy green - smells of cedar tips, rather than dry bark). A herbaceous melange then joins in - dry earthy tobacco, zingy camphorous sage. The patchouli isn‚Äôt skunky, I perceive it as a dry dirt/soil element, and there‚Äôs a subtle vanilla coumarin from the sweet grass. This is earth energy at its finest, incredibly soothing and grounding. 

I am really torn between full sizing Manitou or Voyageurs. They share a dry, earthy DNA and I‚Äôm not sure I need both, but their characters are different and I may not be able to resist üòÖ

Here we go - I (24 F) have been talking to this guy (28 M) I met through a friend. We have known of each other for a few years but finally hung out/went on a date earlier this year. First and second date were absolutely fantastic - Great banter, same sense of humor, same morals and ambitions. Like given how we align so well, I could see this being a great relationship. But our last date/hangout (which was our 3rd time seeing each other) gave me the worst ick in the world. He invited me over to his friends place where he was staying for a weekend (friend wasn't there) - there was no furniture (except beds in bedrooms), wasn't clean (messy, smelly, counters covered with old takeout containers and open/empty alcohol bottles),  etc. We sat on separate bean bag chairs (only seating available in this house) and watched a show. Eventually I grew uncomfortable and left. I keep telling myself, perhaps giving him the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't his place an so he didn't feel the need to clean up, but dude.. you're inviting a girl over to your friends place and not even an ounce of care was put into this.

There‚Äôs a full breakdown and description on the food side of things below, but topline recommendations/results:

Really excellent dinner restaurants I‚Äôd recommend unreservedly:

\-Lola  
\-Allmuen  
\-Iris

Really excellent cafes I‚Äôd recommend unreservedly for breakfast/lunch:

\-Le Cafe Pomme  
\-Klee Kafe  
\-Lovetann Cafe & Bistro

Also just worth noting that ferries through fjords are really a lovely way to get around. While the railway stuff was great, I‚Äôd prioritize ferries unless you need to get from Bergen to Oslo anyway.

Day 1: The evening we arrived, we went to Fjellsk√•l Seafood Restaurant for dinner, and had a seafood platter, razor clams, & cider. The cider (a pet nat from Hardanger) was great; the seafood was perfectly fine but nothing special.

Day 2: We began with breakfast pastries from Baker Brun (fine), and then had lunch at Frescohallen in the Borgen Bors hotel following Kode Museum stuff. It was a gorgeous setting, and perfectly nice lunch (we had the fish stew and a crab salad).

We had an excellent dinner at Lola (fresh scallop, new potatoes, tuna dip, the catch of the day, which was hake, and pavlova for dessert). Great cocktails as well at Lola.

Day 3: Breakfast pastries from Godt Brot (fine), followed by embarking on the single day ‚Äúnutshell‚Äù journey. We had lunch from the food kiosks in Flam (a quite tasty chicken sandwich and salmon poke bowl).

Dinner back in Bergen was at Pingthiven, where we had smoked halibut, fish stew, reindeer steak, and a brown cheese mouse. The fish stew and mousse were excellent, halibut was very good, and the reindeer steak was really disappointing. Service here was also hit and miss - the main server was great, but most of our food was brought by the host who basically plopped it down and walked away. Was a bit surprising.

Day 4: We had a more leisurely breakfast at Le Cafe Pomme, which was excellent. We both had pain au raisins + tea/coffee + fresh juice. Lovely owner/host, great tea service, which is rare, and everything delicious.

We had lunch at Klee Kafe, which was great (we got the two seasonal toasts, one veg and one with meat, both were super yummy). Also they had nice juice to go with.

Dinner was at Allmuen - we had grilled bread + chili mayo, burrata + nduja, roast cod, one other app we can‚Äôt quite remember, and ‚Äúdeconstructed snickers‚Äù for dessert. Good g+t and excellent wine list available by the glass as well. Really enjoyed this meal.

Day 5: Breakfast again at Le Cafe Pomme (this time trying the quiche + ratatouille, also great!). After hiking up to the top of Ulriken (great but quite a bit more taxing than we expected), we had a lovely lunch at the textile museum cafe (soup + mixed plate + pastry), which was honestly the highlight of the textile museum. Not sure it was worth the journey for us but a nice surprise if you're nearby.

We had dinner at Sushi Roll Sandviken. We did the 9-course tasting menu which involved some really tasty stuff but also some odd moments (like 2 of the 9 listed courses - edamame and soup - never actually came, and when asked we were told the menu shifts around, but that wasn‚Äôt told to us at all). The food we were served was very tasty, it just felt a bit inadequate as a full meal.

We had cocktails after at No Stress, which was very nice.

Day 6: This was our final full day of our trip. We breakfasted at Lovetann Cafe and Bistro - Turkish eggs + the salmon toast, plus a pot of tea and a latte. Lovely setting and everything was delicious.

That was it until the capstone of the whole trip, when we took a ferry down to Rosendal and had lunch/dinner at Iris. I‚Äôll do a breakdown post on that separately, but bottom line is that it was an incredible experience and an excellent meal and I‚Äôm very glad we went.

Day 7: Nice buffet breakfast at our hotel in Rosendal and then off to the airport to head home!

\- Since it's small, I want the room to feel open. So someone sitting at a counter table could talk to someone on a couch, etc.  
\- I don't want to block the beautiful window views. Ideally I'd like most seating to be oriented toward the windows. I'd like to block the windows as little as possible  
\- The TV doesn't seem to fit anywhere at all??? I'm thinking of wall mounting it near the kitchen space, but that would make it difficult to watch from the sitting space. (Though I'd try to get one that would swivel)

Can anyone figure out a plan where the TV isn't strange, the seating is functional, and the room feels open?

The current floor plan I designed has the loveseat awkwardly blocking the HVAC system and the seating facing away from the window. I've marked the things that are movable as blue text and the things that aren't movable as red.

I‚Äôm really struggling without longer symptom coverage.¬†

I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs. Lots of life turmoil later I was diagnosed with ADHD less than a year ago. Life literally changed when I took my first dose. Like putting glasses on for the first time.¬† A week after starting meds, I stopped vaping, and suddenly lost interest in alcohol and caffeine. Not long after I left a very toxic relationship, bc for the first time ever, my brain could actually PROCESS and REGULATE, and I realized the relationship was extremely dopamine driven.

I‚Äôve now been medicated for about 9 months. My current prescription is Adderall 25mg ER + 10mg IR booster & 50mg pristiq. I‚Äôve done pretty well on it, and It‚Äôs not that I feel like my meds are ineffective, although some days are better than others. It‚Äôs how long they get me through my day. My psych told me to take booster around 2pm everyday. But months on this regimen, I took XR around 8am and booster was always around 4-5pm. XR feels like it‚Äôs in & out of my system in literally 3-4 hours. I‚Äôm on the smaller side and have always metabolized meds, food, really anything¬† (and yes I know these things correlate differently) ‚Äì very quickly. So basically I would just have to rough it through 1-4ish pm everyday, because being dosed later in the afternoon really helped me. The evenings have always been my most vulnerable time for spiraling, acting on impulses, brain won‚Äôt shut down, will probably stay up working on new ideas until 5am but meds literally changed this, for the first time ever I started getting to bed around the same time every night! I could also calmly manage any small tasks that I procrastinated all day, which in turn helps with the brain noise. But my life has become a bit more demanding, and I really struggled getting through mid days. So I started taking my booster around 1-2pm instead, but managing my symptoms later into the day has become really tough. I started drinking coffee again which has led to a new coffee addiction 1-2 cups a day even with morning meds, started vaping again, usually nap midday then hyperactivity at night (very common before meds) I‚Äôve always felt like I could benefit from an additional dose, but I think I‚Äôm so conditioned by med stigma, that I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. Sometimes I feel like I have very severe ADHD. I mean before meds, I got into 4 car accidents (distracted or impulsively driving), had a new fixation once a week, weather that be a relationship, job, passion etc. Over 15 jobs in like two years. Spent every dime I made on newfound interests. No social desire because it was never about ‚Äúenjoying the time‚Äù it was always about ‚Äúgetting to the next place‚Äù. Could never mentally or physically stay in one place because any form of mundanity literally, physically ached my bones ‚Äì so long story short, it just feels really tough to manage on my own sometimes.

Hello all, I have seen many, many people post in all different s/reddits regarding this class action.

I have learned that I am no where near being alone as far as the lawyers denying my claim.
They didn‚Äôt so much deny it as in ‚Äúthat‚Äôs final ‚Äúas opposed to telling me they need boat load of information about oil changes, mechanics, rental cars, auto insurance , etc. etc. etc.

Some people have some documents, some have none. But we are all being a given a change to fix our ‚Äú incorrect claim‚Äù and get the law team what they need. Right. It‚Äôs not time consuming at all!!!

I would personally like to thank all the Hyundai mechanics and employees.  You all deserve much more than a cup of coffee.  I would bet my life  that Hyundai president/ CEO‚Äôs home base is ‚Äú offering weekly pizza parties ‚Äú to their employees to not give advise on this lawsuit. And asking them to steer clear of customers w class action lawsuit needs. 

Many of us didn‚Äôt just  loose a car, but what was inside the vehicle was also stolen. (  I know it‚Äôs just stuff ).

The even worse part is a sense  that you could no longer walk down the street with out looking over your shoulder all fucking day. Or walking out to your car after work & it‚Äôs not there - and your body hits the floor bc you are at your wits fucking end.

ANYWAY‚Ä¶.. has anyone been able to provide ALL the paper  weight their lawyers asked for - then were green lighted w their class action claim? 
Does anyone have a sample receipt of what their personal class action Kia/ Hyundai folder will look like once submitted.

I‚Äôm not sure what direction to go in and would love input .

1me5j45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedTech/comments/1me5j45/reveal_if_the_best_wireless_earbuds_jabra_evolve2/,Reveal if the Best Wireless Earbuds Jabra Evolve2 Are Worth It,"Jabra Evolve2 20797-999-999 earbuds have been a game-changer for me over several months of daily use, and I have plenty to say about this nifty little piece of tech. Whether I‚Äôm navigating chaotic work-from-home days or escaping into my favorite playlists while out on a walk, these earbuds have seamlessly integrated into my routine. They‚Äôve got strengths worth celebrating and a few quirks that might make you think twice, so let‚Äôs dive in.

**Design and Comfort**  
The design of these earbuds immediately stood out from my previous pairs. Compact and minimalistic, they boast an ergonomic fit that genuinely seems tailored to my ears. I‚Äôve been using them during workouts, long commutes, and even during lengthy online meetings, and I can confidently say that they don‚Äôt budge. The Evolve2 earbuds are lightweight at just 0.35 ounces, and their IP57 water resistance gives me peace of mind when I accidentally sweat buckets during gym sessions. Plus, the snug fit means improved noise isolation, but more on that later. 

**Audio Performance**  
Let‚Äôs talk sound quality because it‚Äôs a major factor when deciding on earbuds. The audio clarity is stellar, with a frequency response range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz delivering balanced highs and rich lows. Whether I‚Äôm listening to podcasts, acoustic tracks, or bass-heavy songs, the earbuds consistently provide clear and immersive audio. However, I noticed that while they performed impressively with crisp treble and smooth midrange tones, the bass could use just a bit more punch to rival some other premium earbuds on the market. That said, they‚Äôve elevated my music-listening experience in quiet environments.

[Check Jabra Evolve2 20797-999-999 price on Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b0blzyfk3t/)

**Call Quality and Connectivity**  
The four-microphone MultiSensor Voice technology, which includes bone conduction sensors and clever algorithms, transforms the way phone calls feel. I tested these features in bustling coffee shops, noisy streets, and windy parks, and the earbuds did a commendable job suppressing background noise. According to my coworkers, my voice remained impressively clear, and I appreciated not having to repeat myself frequently. Adding to their usability is the advanced Bluetooth 5.2 Multipoint feature, which simultaneously connects to my laptop and phone. Switching between devices is smooth, and I don‚Äôt have to fiddle with settings constantly‚Äîa huge plus when juggling back-to-back Zoom calls and text notifications.

**Active Noise Cancellation and HearThrough**  
The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) function is another winner. These earbuds allow me to escape into my own zone when the world around me gets too noisy. While the ANC might not rival larger over-ear headphones, it‚Äôs quite effective given the size of the earbuds. On days when I want to stay aware of my surroundings, the intuitive HearThrough technology works like magic by letting ambient sound filter through naturally. Oddly enough, I used HearThrough while biking around my neighborhood, and it struck a perfect balance between safety and immersion.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery life was one of my biggest concerns before purchasing, but the Jabra Evolve2 didn‚Äôt disappoint. A single charge gives around 8 hours of playtime with ANC active, while the wireless charging case extends it to 33 hours. It‚Äôs come in handy during long trips. The fast-charge function is incredibly useful during crunch times‚Äîa quick 5-minute charge provides another hour of playback. I‚Äôve grown to love this convenience, especially after forgetting to charge them overnight (which happens often enough). The dual buds can also function independently thanks to Mono Mode, a lifesaver for multitaskers like me.

**Advantages**  
- Comfortable ergonomic design that doesn‚Äôt compromise durability.  
- Stellar voice clarity with four microphones and bone conduction sensors.  
- Adjustable ANC and HearThrough modes adapt to working or outdoor environments.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Bass performance could be more prominent for hardcore audiophiles.  
- Price point may feel higher compared to some competitors offering similar features.  

**Other Options**  
In a market full of competitors, products like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and Sony WF-1000XM4 naturally come to mind. Bose‚Äôs QuietComfort earbuds, for instance, have an edge when it comes to Active Noise Cancellation, creating an even quieter listening environment. The Sony WF-1000XM4, on the other hand, boasts slightly fuller bass and more dynamic tuning. Yet, the Jabra Evolve2 earbuds stand strong with their incredible call quality and reliable Bluetooth Multipoint function, making them ideal for those who frequently juggle calls on multiple devices. 

**Price Performance**  
On the financial side, this product leans toward the premium side, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a waste of money given the range of features‚Äîespecially Bluetooth Multipoint, advanced call technology, and durable design. People who spend considerable time in virtual meetings or calls will find them worth the price tag. Could they be more affordable? Sure, but considering what they offer, it feels like you‚Äôre squeezing a lot out of your investment.

We live on the first floor of our apartment building and have a nice view of the community garden...I kept having this vision of if someone we're looking through our window - would they think we're not in love? Just each isolated on our phone? 

With such a big life moment ahead, we both began to discuss this this enormous guilt that we we're wasting our best most productive and years staring into the phones when we could be laughing together or exploring the new city we just moved too. 

We've been exhausted from work lately, and lots of wedding planning - but we feel like we're just throwing time out the window on TikTok or IG watching everyone do everything while we sit in silence. 

We recently did a little double date for coffee and hit the bookstore next door, we legit wandered it for hours with friends and bought a ton of books to fill up our currently empty bookshelves. 

A few weeks decided to begin reading them together instead of turning on the TV after work. We'll usually go outside in the little park area in our building with the dog, or if its late we'll both sit upright on the couch with a candle lit. 

**We've read a combined 700 pages together and spent 13 hours reading over last few weeks** (have a little app that does screentime restrictions and book progress tracking) 

Recommending this to start a good foundation of not falling down the TV / TikTok rabbit hole - winning your most quality time back with the people you care about.

I usually don't go for rare types of specialty coffee but out of curiosity, I purchased a Gesha, roasted for espresso from AMOC [https://amatterofconcrete.com/product/052/](https://amatterofconcrete.com/product/052/) .  
I don't have much experience with the variety, but my few run-ins with it were not good and I just ignored it as it's either over-hyped and expensive, usually aimed for filter.  
I found it weird that it's not a filter roast, which I usually get for my standard roasts, even if I only brew espresso out of those, since most roasters just roast darker and call it espresso.

Now my problem with this one is that it's 12 days off roast, the beans look kinda lower end of medium, but I can't pull anything out of these.

If you‚Äôre like me, this week has probably felt like a blur. The $ATYR price action, that coordinated bear raid, and a flood of social media noise have made it one of the most eventful stretches I‚Äôve seen in biotech for a while. I‚Äôve even had the questionable pleasure of interacting with Martin Shkreli himself - not exactly ‚Äòdelightful‚Äô, but it‚Äôs all part of the experience I guess!

I‚Äôve heard from plenty of you in DMs and comments - questions about the stubbornly low price, the conviction of the long crowd, and where this might head into the readout. Honestly, I get it. When you‚Äôre in the thick of it, it‚Äôs easy to feel a bit battered by the noise.

So, I wanted to step back and lay out what I‚Äôm seeing in this morning‚Äôs trading, talk through how I‚Äôm reading the price action, and maybe pull together a few lessons that stand out after a week like this. As always, this isn‚Äôt advice‚Äîjust sharing how I see it after a pretty wild run.

Let‚Äôs get into it.

---

**Early Tape: Price, Volume, and Sentiment**

Kicking off the day, $ATYR is holding above $4.80 at 11:45am, with about 2.8 million shares traded. What stands out is just how much quieter things have become after the chaos of the last couple of sessions. The tape feels less frantic, almost like the market is collectively taking a breath and waiting for the next shoe to drop.

We‚Äôre not seeing the sharp bounce you might expect after a flush, but there‚Äôs also no evidence of outright panic or forced liquidation. The trading range is tight, and the flow is dominated by mid-sized, routine lots‚Äînot the large, aggressive blocks you‚Äôd expect if there were major institutions heading for the exits. That alone is telling: it suggests that while there‚Äôs still plenty of uncertainty, we‚Äôre not looking at a breakdown in conviction.

- Price: ~$4.80 (11:45am)
- Volume: ~2.8 million shares traded
- Range: fairly tight, no major spikes or collapses
- Order flow: steady mid-sized trades, no outsized or urgent blocks

If you‚Äôre sitting there wondering why we haven‚Äôt bounced hard‚Äîor why it feels so lifeless after all the drama‚ÄîI‚Äôd say this is actually pretty typical for this part of the biotech cycle, especially after a coordinated bear raid and heading into a high-stakes catalyst. In my experience, these sorts of stretches often look a bit like a stalemate. The market digests the shock, forced sellers get flushed, and then everyone waits for a new signal.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that, despite the fear and uncertainty circulating in some corners of social media, the absence of large, desperate block sales or outsized market-on-close prints tells me that there‚Äôs no evidence of a leak or fundamental blow-up. The action this morning doesn‚Äôt read as a story of lost conviction so much as one of collective hesitation. In other words, it‚Äôs a vacuum‚Äîpeople are waiting, not bailing.

If you‚Äôre anxious about the lack of a rebound or the possibility of hidden bad news, I‚Äôd just say this: these periods are common in the lead-up to a binary readout. Things can drift for a while at lower levels, and the tape can feel heavy, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there‚Äôs a deeper problem. More often than not, it‚Äôs just a waiting game.

---

**What‚Äôs Happening Behind the Scenes? Institutional and Options Dynamics**

If you step back from the intraday volatility, what I‚Äôm seeing is a market that‚Äôs probably reflecting more in the way of mechanics than any true, lasting shift in conviction. Yes, there‚Äôs been a heavy retail-driven flush and a flurry of short-term trading after the bear raid, but if you look at the filings, most core institutional holders haven‚Äôt been making big moves. The big long-only funds and index trackers‚ÄîFidelity, Vanguard, BlackRock‚Äîare still on the books, at least as far as the data lets us see for now.

The other major ingredient is the options setup. Open interest at the August $7.50 call strike is still enormous, and with so much positioning there, the tape has a tendency to gravitate toward ‚Äúmax pain‚Äù for the largest number of market participants. This can suppress upward movement, even if there‚Äôs no new fundamental information, simply because of how options dealers and large holders are hedged.

- **Institutional positioning:** So far, no meaningful mass exit, though we‚Äôll know much more when the new filings come out (more on that later in today‚Äôs post)
- **Options chain:** Huge OI at $7.50 strike, with price action showing classic ‚Äúpinning‚Äù behaviour
- **Retail/short-term traders:** Amplifying volatility, but not the underlying driver of value

The bottom line, at least the way I read it, is that the current price action is probably less about a deep change in the collective view on $ATYR, and more about the push and pull of market structure in the run-up to the next event. As always, the truth of what the institutions are really doing will show up in the filings‚Äîand we‚Äôll dig into that a bit further on.

**Social Sentiment and the ‚ÄúSwitch-Off‚Äù Effect**

I‚Äôve been tracking social activity closely across pretty much every relevant channel - Twitter/X, Stocktwits, Reddit, and a few more. Over the last 48 hours, the noise level was intense: relentless posting, coordinated talking points, and a consistent push to stir up as much fear and doubt as possible. In my view, the pattern of activity was impossible to miss - if you were watching, you‚Äôd have seen:

- The same narratives posted across multiple platforms, often almost word-for-word
- Shkreli showing up everywhere - sometimes directly, sometimes via ‚Äúadjacent‚Äù accounts‚Äîmaking sure his perspective dominated the discourse
- A handful of amplifying accounts (probably 5-10) piling on, echoing, and elevating the core bear messages in near real time

This is classic playbook stuff for a social bear raid: drive volume, push negativity, and see how many retail holders can be rattled out of their positions through sheer noise and repetition. The aim, in my opinion, is rarely to educate or inform - it‚Äôs to overwhelm the information environment and weaponise uncertainty.

And then, almost without warning, the narrative just stopped. This morning, there‚Äôs barely a peep. Shkreli‚Äôs network has gone dark, the echo accounts are silent, and even the usual retail chatter is way down. There‚Äôs no slow fade - it‚Äôs just like someone flipped a switch and the campaign stood down.

**Why Does This Happen?**

A few factors jump out when you see this pattern play out:

- *Hit-and-run tactics:* The initial barrage creates a short-term ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù effect, hoping to move the price and trip stop losses. Once that‚Äôs done, the campaign pauses to reassess.
- *No new ammunition:* If the initial wave fails to sustain momentum, attackers often pull back to avoid overextending or drawing too much scrutiny.
- *Waiting for filings/events:* With new institutional filings and earnings coming up, some actors may be holding back to see if real news creates new opportunities.

**The Legality Question**

I‚Äôve received a lot of questions about whether all this crosses a legal line. Here‚Äôs my take:

- *Regulatory grey zone:* Most of what we‚Äôre seeing is public posting, with just enough plausible deniability (‚Äúnot investment advice,‚Äù ‚Äújust my opinion‚Äù) to keep it technically above board.
- *Enforcement is rare:* Regulators need evidence of explicit coordination and intent - private messages, payments, clear directives. That bar is very hard to clear when everything happens out in the open and is cloaked in social media norms.
- *Why it persists:* As long as actors stick to public channels and avoid direct calls to action, it‚Äôs almost impossible to prosecute - even if the intent is obvious to market veterans.

**Lessons and Takeaways**

- *Don‚Äôt mistake noise for substance.* What we saw was mostly a campaign to move sentiment, not a reflection of underlying $ATYR fundamentals.
- *Abrupt silence isn‚Äôt bullish or bearish in itself.* More often than not, it just means the first phase of the playbook has run its course, and the market is now left waiting for real news or the next move.

*If you‚Äôre feeling unsettled by the drama, you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôd just remind everyone - this is pre-catalyst biotech, and this is how the game is sometimes played. The real signals, in my view, are coming from institutional behaviour, upcoming filings, and the actual data - not the day-to-day noise.*

---

**Institutional Positioning: The Real Signal**

If you want to get a sense of what really matters in the $ATYR setup right now, you have to look through the noise and focus on the institutional behaviour and the deeper market mechanics. While the retail crowd and social sentiment can swing hard on news and emotion, it‚Äôs the way the larger players are acting - quietly, deliberately - that often tells you what‚Äôs coming next.

*Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs happening:*

**Upcoming Filings ‚Äì A Crucial Window**
- The next major 13F institutional filings hit on August 15, covering positions as of May 30. While that‚Äôs a lag, it will give us the first big read on how major funds have positioned in the run-up to the catalyst period. What you really want to see here is whether big long-term funds have added, trimmed, or sat tight.
- It‚Äôs worth remembering: Many institutional players are either locked in (index funds), slow to move (mutuals), or deliberately staying under the radar until the catalyst is in sight.

**Options Chain ‚Äì Reading the Fine Print**
- The open interest on the *August* $7.50 calls is huge, but keep in mind this expiry *precedes* the likely catalyst window. This means anyone who loaded these contracts was either betting on a run-up, short-term squeeze, or perhaps just hedging exposure rather than making a directional bet on readout itself.
- The *September* $7.50 calls are more directly in play for a possible readout. The open interest here is also significant - hundreds of thousands of contracts - suggesting that a large cohort is positioning for a binary event, not just noise-driven volatility.
- What I‚Äôm watching: Do these contracts roll to later expiries if the readout is delayed, or do you see a sharp unwind? If institutions are confident, you might see more rolling out and re-loading at higher strikes as the window tightens.

**Active vs Passive Ownership**
- The ownership base right now is a blend of large passive funds (Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity index products) and a smattering of active specialist funds and crossovers.
- The passive funds provide a ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of sorts‚Äîshares that aren‚Äôt easily shaken out by price action or social campaigns.
- The real question is what the active funds do in the run-up. Recent history shows most have been content to hold or gently add. There hasn‚Äôt been a mass exit, which you‚Äôd expect to see if institutions had soured on the story. Instead, it feels like a waiting game: funds don‚Äôt want to blink first, and most are prepared to sit tight through volatility.

**Short Interest and Tactical Positioning**
- Short interest remains elevated, and in my view, the last week‚Äôs campaign brought in some new short-term players - those hoping to profit from a price break, not necessarily betting against the science long term.
- These tactical shorts tend to be less patient and can be forced to cover quickly if the price rebounds or if buying pressure comes in ahead of the catalyst.
- I‚Äôm watching for signs of a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù setup - high short interest, limited borrow, and increasing open interest in OTM calls for the catalyst window.

**Other Nuances and What To Watch**
- Look for clues in volume patterns: heavy volume on down days followed by sharp drops in social chatter often means tactical trading, not true conviction selling.
- If new filings (especially after August 15) show net buying by well-known biotech or crossover funds, that‚Äôs a genuine green flag for conviction.
- Conversely, if you see the $7.50+ call open interest unwind in size, it could signal either risk aversion (traders hedging) or a lack of faith in a near-term run.

*My read, at this point: The institutional base remains ‚Äústicky‚Äù and patient, and the options market is signalling that at least some players are bracing for major volatility around September. The fact that so much OI remains at the $7.50 and $10+ strikes, despite the recent social onslaught, suggests real money is still backing a meaningful move. The next round of filings will be crucial, but for now, I‚Äôd say the story is less about panic, more about positioning for a major binary event.*

**What‚Äôs Happening in the Options Market?**

If you‚Äôve been tracking $ATYR‚Äôs setup lately, you‚Äôll notice the options board is a bit of a minefield ‚Äì a mix of massive open interest at key strikes, sky-high volatility, and the kind of positioning that (at least in my view) says a lot more about psychology and market structure than about any clear ‚Äúleak‚Äù or fundamental signal.

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of some of the standout numbers as of this morning:

| Expiry      | Strike | Call OI  | Put OI   |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Aug 15      | $7.50  | 11,511   | 32       |
| Aug 15      | $10.00 | 1,664    | 3        |
| Sep 19      | $7.50  | 3,962    | 301      |
| Sep 19      | $10.00 | 627      | 60       |
| Sep 19      | $12.00 | 3,251    | 0        |

*How I‚Äôm reading the landscape right now:*

- **August $7.50 Calls:** The open interest is huge. But let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äì these expire before the actual Phase 3 catalyst window. In my experience, that suggests the bulk of this interest was put on for a run-up or short squeeze play, rather than a pure ‚Äúbet the readout‚Äù wager. These contracts will need the stock to snap back, and if not, we could see a rush to cover or roll, which can drive more volatility as expiry approaches.
- **Out-of-the-Money Calls (September and Beyond):** The high OI out at September $7.50 and especially $12 is more interesting to me. This is where you tend to find the ‚Äúhigh-volatility crowd‚Äù and those with real conviction in the binary event. If you‚Äôve been around biotech for a while, you know that sometimes these positions are hedges by funds who are long equity, but often, they‚Äôre also directional bets by sophisticated retail or smaller funds hunting for that post-catalyst explosion.
- **Put/Call Ratio and Directional Tilt:** If this were a market convinced the readout would fail, you‚Äôd expect put open interest to balloon at every major strike. Instead, the put/call ratio is not signalling panic ‚Äì in fact, there‚Äôs more call than put OI at every notable level. That‚Äôs not always predictive, but it‚Äôs not what you see ahead of a disaster, either.
- **Implied Volatility (IV):** IV at the $7.50 and $10 strikes for August and September is through the roof, which tells you two things: (1) the market is bracing for a major move, and (2) options are expensive ‚Äì so anyone buying big size is either very convicted or hedging a substantial book.
- **Volume Patterns and Roll Behaviour:** One of the subtle tells I look for is how OI evolves as we move closer to expiry. If traders start rolling out of August to September, or shifting strikes, that can be a signal that the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù wants to stay in play for the actual data and isn‚Äôt just playing for a bounce.
- **Dealer Positioning and Gamma:** The size of these positions at key strikes means dealers may be dynamically hedging, which can amplify swings in both directions. If there‚Äôs a sudden move ‚Äì up or down ‚Äì you often get forced buying or selling that has little to do with fundamentals and everything to do with market plumbing.

*Why does all this matter?*  
In my view, this is a textbook case of options creating a sort of ‚Äútrapdoor floor and ceiling.‚Äù With so many contracts clustered at specific strikes, you often see sharp, artificial moves as expiry nears ‚Äì only to see the real trend emerge once the options pressure is gone. The fact that the $7.50 and $10 strikes are so crowded means a snap-back rally isn‚Äôt off the table, especially if shorts start to cover or new buyers step in. But if we continue to drift and those contracts expire worthless, you might see temporary apathy ‚Äì until positioning reloads for the September binary.

- For readers new to this: Watch not just the price, but the changes in open interest and volume at the biggest strikes. That‚Äôll often tell you where the battle lines are drawn, and where the next wave of volatility could come from.
- For those with a position or thinking about one: Recognise that options activity isn‚Äôt always a crystal ball ‚Äì but it does telegraph where risk is being taken, and where there might be hidden leverage if the price starts to move with conviction.

All told, I‚Äôd say the options market is telling a story of heightened tension, tactical trading, and a lot of smart money sitting on its hands until the real news hits. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing, at least.

**Sentiment and Social Volume Check**

If you‚Äôve been watching the social feeds the past few days, you‚Äôve probably noticed what I have: after an almost deafening bear blitz that took over Reddit, X (Twitter), and Discord for a solid 48 hours, things have gone nearly silent. On Monday and Tuesday, it felt like every post, every reply, and every DM was either pushing fear, ridiculing bulls, or seeding doubts about the Phase 3. The tone wasn‚Äôt just negative ‚Äì it was co-ordinated, at times personal, and repeated across multiple platforms.

But as of this morning, that storm has pretty much vanished.  
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm tracking and what I think is worth noting for anyone learning to read social signals in these markets:

- **Where did the noise go?**  
  - Shkreli and his regular amplifiers (the accounts that instantly echo his messaging) haven‚Äôt posted about $ATYR since yesterday morning.  
  - Discord and Telegram groups that were spinning out message after message ‚Äì now barely a blip.  
  - Reddit threads that were averaging dozens of heated comments per hour are, as of now, back to the usual handful, and the mood is noticeably less charged.

- **Was this an organic shift, or something engineered?**  
  - The speed and synchrony of the drop-off is hard to ignore. Either the ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù achieved its short-term aim (possibly linked to option expiry or shaking out some retail), or whoever‚Äôs driving the narrative is regrouping for another go, maybe closer to a new trigger like earnings or the next 13F update.

- **Retail and community sentiment:**  
  - A lot of holders seem stunned ‚Äì less panicked than I would have expected, but definitely in a holding pattern.  
  - Some are checking out entirely (‚Äúwake me up for the readout‚Äù), while a smaller group is quietly adding on the lows.  
  - I‚Äôm also seeing fewer aggressive debates and much more subdued commentary, which often means people are simply waiting for new facts, not opinions.

- **What can we actually learn from this?**  
  - Crowd psychology matters. The speed at which sentiment turns (both up and down) can often be as important as any data release.  
  - Co-ordinated FUD is real and can move markets ‚Äì but only temporarily unless there‚Äôs substance.  
  - Most major moves are driven by new information or a change in narrative, not just loud voices on socials.  
  - Watching for sudden ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù periods ‚Äì after a blitz of noise ‚Äì can sometimes be the best contrarian signal out there.

For anyone new to this game: don‚Äôt just count the volume of posts or upvotes. Look at when things go quiet, who goes quiet, and whether the market‚Äôs actually reacting to substance or just to social theatre.

In my view, we‚Äôre in a holding pattern, with most of the manufactured drama behind us (for now). I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this quiet spell is just the calm before another wave ‚Äì either when fresh news drops or when the next trading opportunity presents itself.

---

**My Personal Read**

The way I see things, what we‚Äôre witnessing in $ATYR right now is a product of market microstructure and crowd psychology, not a change in the underlying thesis or a sudden emergence of new information. If you‚Äôve followed the noise, the FUD campaigns, and then this abrupt silence, you‚Äôll recognise the tell-tale pattern of sentiment-driven trading that often masks the real story beneath the surface.

That said, here‚Äôs a list of hypotheses I‚Äôm actively weighing‚Äîeach grounded in recent market action, institutional behaviour, the options landscape, and the broader scientific/commercial context:

- **Hypothesis 1: The selloff and social blitz were largely engineered for short-term gain, not because of new negative information.**  
  *Basis:* The coordinated nature and sudden drop-off of negative posts, paired with concentrated trading volume during US open and options-driven timeframes, points to tactical FUD to shake out weak hands and possibly reprice options contracts ahead of expiry. The absence of any confirmatory filings, volume spikes in large blocks, or abnormal institutional movement supports this.

- **Hypothesis 2: Institutional conviction remains, but funds are happy to let retail churn at lower levels pre-catalyst.**  
  *Basis:* Recent 13F flows, while featuring some tactical reductions, continue to show large passive and active funds holding substantial positions. There‚Äôs little sign of ‚Äúget me out‚Äù behaviour from the big holders; rather, it‚Äôs a pattern of letting the tape settle and potentially absorbing size passively as volatility flushes out retail.

- **Hypothesis 3: The lack of a rapid rebound is more about mechanics than a true loss of faith.**  
  *Basis:* Retail is battered and sidelined, and with many participants in wait-and-see mode, there‚Äôs less incremental buying pressure after the selloff. Institutions, meanwhile, have little incentive to bid things up until there‚Äôs a catalyst. The tape is thin, so small net sellers keep the price soft.

- **Hypothesis 4: The ‚Äúradio silence‚Äù on socials may be a signal in itself.**  
  *Basis:* The abrupt halt to coordinated negative posting suggests the campaign had a specific tactical aim‚Äîperhaps linked to the July/August options cycle, or even a temporary unwind before preparing for a new push. Historically, FUD waves like this fade once traders have achieved their short-term objectives (e.g., cheapening call options, triggering stop losses).

- **Hypothesis 5: No evidence supports a data leak or a fundamental change in the readout probability.**  
  *Basis:* If meaningful negative information had actually slipped out, we‚Äôd see it in a very different trading pattern‚Äîaccelerating volume, large block prints, and an uptick in put OI and deep in-the-money put buying. We haven‚Äôt seen any of that; the tape remains a low-energy, low-conviction drift.

- **Hypothesis 6: The options chain (particularly the massive OI at $7.50 September calls) could drive volatility around expiry, not before.**  
  *Basis:* The bulk of OI is clustered around September strikes, and with no near-term binary event, there‚Äôs little incentive to aggressively bid up price pre-catalyst. Expect more mechanical trading until there‚Äôs a reason for institutions to re-engage.

**In summary:**  
I‚Äôm not seeing signs of permanent damage to institutional conviction, nor any true information asymmetry that would suggest a leak or a ‚Äúdeath blow‚Äù to the $ATYR thesis. Right now, it looks like a low-energy drift shaped by recent market mechanics, with the underlying bull thesis untouched by the noise. Still, it pays to watch for any shift in the pattern‚Äîespecially in options, block trades, and new filings.

**What to Watch Next**

If you‚Äôve been following $ATYR, you‚Äôll know August 15 is no ordinary date - earnings, options expiry, and institutional ownership filings are all set to land together. In my view, that creates one of the most information-rich and potentially volatile setups we‚Äôve seen in this name. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be watching, and how I‚Äôd suggest others approach it as well:

**Earnings Release**  
We‚Äôre not expecting revenue fireworks, but I‚Äôll be looking for subtle signals: cash runway projections, comments on burn discipline, headcount trends, and anything management says (or doesn‚Äôt say) about commercial buildout or readiness. Shukla‚Äôs demeanour too. Sometimes it‚Äôs the offhand remarks or behaviours that give the clearest read on management‚Äôs confidence or state of mind.

**Options Expiry ‚Äì August 15**  
With massive open interest on the August $7.50 calls, there‚Äôs plenty of attention on how the tape trades into expiry. Remember, the real catalyst - the Phase 3 data - comes later, so a lot of these positions are likely hedges or short-term punts. If you see sharp moves near the strike on expiry day, it‚Äôs rarely about new information; more often, it‚Äôs market makers unwinding risk or pinning the price. It‚Äôs worth tracking September and October as the next ‚Äúreal‚Äù battlegrounds.

**13F and NPORT Filings**  
This next batch of filings will give us a window into which funds used the recent volatility to build, which ones were shaken out, and whether any stealth buyers have emerged. Watch for moves by the high-conviction holders ‚Äî their decisions tend to set the tone for everyone else.

**Price/Volume Patterns**
- What I‚Äôm watching: Are we seeing drifty, apathetic trade (sign of exhausted sellers/buyers), or sudden volume surges that hint at new big players stepping in?
- Tells: Volume spikes outside the open and close often indicate meaningful institutional activity. Multiple blocks printing around the same levels can mean someone is quietly building or exiting a position.

**Block Prints & Dark Pool Activity**
- Even thinly traded names like $ATYR throw up clues if you watch for mid-day block prints or large trades off the market.
- Blocks crossing near the bid on a down day could mean capitulation; blocks near the ask might signal quiet accumulation.

**Options Chain**
- Open interest is stacked for September and October. If you start to see new sweeps or spread trades in these out months, it may be the market positioning for the data window.
- On expiry, ‚Äúpinning‚Äù tactics may keep prices close to max pain. I‚Äôll be looking for any last-minute shifts in OI that suggest new conviction.

**Social/News Flow**
- After two days of what felt like relentless, almost scripted FUD across Reddit, X, and Stocktwits, today‚Äôs sudden silence is striking. To me, it reads like a coordinated campaign either wrapped up its objective, ran out of steam, or is resetting for another push.
- I‚Äôm monitoring for any re-emergence of these accounts or influencer activity. A sudden ramp-up could precede new volatility.

**Institutional Filings & Ownership Updates**
- These next filings will be especially telling: do we see high-conviction names holding (or even adding), or did the pile-on flush out some hands? That, more than price action, is what I treat as the real ‚Äútell‚Äù in periods like this.

**Regulatory/Data Hints**
- I always watch for stray clues ‚Äî DSMB updates, changes to trial registries, or even subtle regulatory website moves. Sometimes these drop before the formal press releases and can move the market for those paying attention.

---

**Key Takeaway for the Community**

Markets like this are designed to shake the conviction out of retail and even the less committed institutions. My advice (if you‚Äôll allow it) is to use these quiet spells to practice your forensic lens:
- Zoom in on patterns, not the noise.
- When everyone‚Äôs panicking, look for what the big money is (or isn‚Äôt) doing.
- When things go eerily quiet, don‚Äôt assume the story has changed ‚Äî often, it‚Äôs just a lull before the next round of theatre.

At the end of the day, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree, most ‚Äútells‚Äù will show up first in the patterns, not in the headlines or the latest tweet. 

---

**In Summary**

I think what we‚Äôre seeing right now is the classic calm after a storm. We‚Äôve had two days of relentless noise, a major reset in price, and now things are strangely quiet across both the tape and socials. For me, nothing fundamental appears to have changed ‚Äî no credible data leaks, no genuine signs that conviction holders are abandoning ship. If anything, it feels like the market is just marking time and waiting for the next catalyst. I‚Äôm watching the block prints, the options flow, the social sentiment, and the upcoming triple event on August 15th. I‚Äôd encourage anyone feeling rattled by the recent volatility to calmly focus on the signals and patterns, not just the headlines.

The day I moved my stuff in to their house, they got us a great dinner, we had amazing sex, and they got me coffee and breakfast in bed the next morning üíò I just keep remembering how I felt when we first met and knowing I loved them, and I‚Äôm so ready to live my life with them.

Male, 33. APOC3 polymorphism, chronically high blood uric acid.

I was running an experiment in 2022 and I figured it out, but I landed on a very strict diet that requires you to cook yourself only.  had to avoid purines because my Uric acid is also chronically elevated.

I experimented for 6 months, been taking tests every 2-3 weeks. This is how the diet looked like:

1. Main protein source - scrambled eggs with 1 or 2 yolks max (boring af but I learned to love it over time)
2. Main side dish - fried or grilled vegetables (cauliflower, zucchini and brocolli)
3. Keto-friendly, see attachments for detials

Result:  
LDL 3.15 mmol/L --> 2.2 mmol/L

Here‚Äôs the truth: lack of sleep postpartum isn‚Äôt just tiring.

It messes with your head. It messes with your hormones. It messes with your relationships.

It can look like:
‚Äì Rage that scares even you
‚Äì Crying over spilled breastmilk (literally)
‚Äì Snapping at your partner because he slept peacefully while you were up 5 times
‚Äì Anxiety that makes you dread nighttime
‚Äì Skin breakouts, brain fog, and that weird twitch in your eye that won‚Äôt quit

And still we‚Äôre expected to smile, snap photos, and ""soak it all in.""
Spoiler alert: you can‚Äôt soak it in when you're running on fumes and coffee you‚Äôve reheated six times.

That‚Äôs exactly why I created The Held Mama.
Not as some fluffy feel-good brand, but as a real, raw, human support system for mamas who are drowning.

I offer:

1me56nw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1me56nw,Review: Cathay Pacific The Pier Business Class Lounge Review at Hong Kong (HKG),"I had the opportunity to check out Cathay‚Äôs flagship business class lounge in Hong Kong and was SHOCKED at how nice it was. The Pier Business Class Lounge is on par with many first class lounges.

I‚Äôve tried out over 50 airline lounges at this point and this lounge is the 2nd best business class lounge, just after Qatar Airways‚Äô Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha.

I had access to this lounge from a short hop Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Taipei. I found this flight for 16,000 points + $62 using Cathay Pacific miles after setting flight alerts on the [roame.travel](http://roame.travel) tool.

It would be 4 to 5 cents per point depending on your dates.

**Location & Access**

Located near Gate‚ÄØ65 in Terminal‚ÄØ1, accessible via an escalator leading to a lower level.

Open daily from 5:30‚ÄØAM to 12:30‚ÄØAM.¬†

Entry for business class passengers on Cathay or any oneworld airline, plus oneworld Sapphire members regardless of cabin class.¬†

**Design & Layout**

Designed by London-based Studioilse, under the leadership of Ilse Crawford, the lounge focuses on wellness and residential comfort. The Lounge opened 2016 and features natural materials, warm lighting, and various ‚Äúrooms‚Äù to help guests feel relaxed and refreshed.¬†

The lounge is one gigantic rectangle with many sections or ‚Äúrooms.‚Äù It spans approximately 3,306‚ÄØsquare meters (\~35,500‚ÄØsquare feet) and can accommodate up to 550 guests at once. It‚Äôs Cathay Pacific‚Äôs flagship lounge and their largest.

\*Cathay Pacific has many business class lounges at Hong Kong Airport, so make sure you visit this one.

There are two main walkways, one through the food & service areas and another along the windows with views of the tarmac.

**Amenities in Detail**

The Zones (or ‚Äúrooms‚Äù) are: the main seating area, Food Hall, Noodle Bar, Tea House, Bar, Relaxation Room, showers, and lockers.

As the flagship lounge at Cathay Pacific‚Äôs home airport, the lounge was quite busy, but there was ample seating in most of the rooms.

I only had \~40 minutes to check out the lounge (eat, drink, take photos, etc.), so unfortunately I was not able to try out the showers or nap in the Relaxation Room.

**Main Seating Area:** Spacious and varied seating, with floor-to-ceiling windows and runway views.

**Food Hall:** Upscale buffet with pizzas, charcuterie, cheeses, hot entrees, baked goods. I skipped most of the room because it was mostly Western food options and I was here for Hong Kong classics.

**Noodle Bar:** Made‚Äëto‚Äëorder Asian classics including wonton noodles, dim sum, ramen. This was my favorite room by far. You could freshly made and steamed dim sum or noodles from the bar. They give you one of those buzzer things to let you know when your order is ready.

**Tea House:** Minimalist space offering curated teas and light pastries. Darker room with spotlights on the pastries. I had to stop myself from eating too many desserts because there were so many and so good! Note: Asian desserts are not as sweet.

**Bar Area:** Full beverage service alongside a coffee cart staffed by a barista. Very aesthetic. I did not drink any of the alcoholic beverages, but they had a wide selection.

I did, however, pour myself multiple glasses of Hong Kong-style milk team from their self-serve pitchers!

**Relaxation Room:** Dim-lit private daybeds all the way on one end of the lounge.

Stepping into the Relaxation Room, felt quite relaxing (pun intended). The room was quite large with 14 semi-private daybeds, each in its own low-lit alcove with an ottoman. Adjacent to the bed area, there are two plush sectional seating areas.

Showers: I did not try out the showers, but they have fourteen shower suites.

**Overall Score: 9.5/10**

The Pier Business Class Lounge is a standout and I was not expecting how spectacular it was from design to food. For comparison, I enjoyed this lounge more than the Japan Airlines First Class lounge in Haneda.

I would highly recommend visiting this lounge if you have access. I only wish I had more time than \~40 minutes.

***

I thought we made a fair deal but one of my friends raged at me and called me ""economically abusive"" so here we are.

I recently bought a new phone (about $500). Used it for about two days, but found it too heavy. So I went back to my old one. 

Okay so I live in a 1 bed 2 bath apartment. I have a cleaning lady (Fran) come twice a week. Most of the time, it's just the living room and hallway bathroom since I like to sleep in and prefer cleaning my bedroom myself. 

I think it's important to share what I ask her to do, for context:

-- Load/unload dishwasher

-- Turn on robot vacuum

-- Dust and wipe counters

-- Clean the hallway bathroom (which I don't use)

-- Change the bag on my automatic litterbox

-- Throw out the garbage

-- Bing in my packages

-- Vacuum and wipe my leather couch

-- miscellaneous tasks like refilling the cat food dispenser when it runs low

It takes her about 45 minutes to finish. Sometimes less. Once, I ordered Starbucks for the both of us and she was done before the coffee arrived haha

Fran's phone is old and busted AF. So I asked her if she wanted the new one I wasn't using.

She said yes but she couldn't afford to pay for it. I said that's fine, I'm happy to give it to her.

Fran wouldn't accept it unless I let her pay in installments. So I told her how about this, what if you gave me 10 free cleanings in exchange for the phone?

She finally agreed but wanted to bump it up to 25 free cleanings. I said I was okay with 12 and that was that. We laughed and shook on it. I've started receiving photos of her pets and kids, she's loving the camera lol.

Told my friend the other day and she got REALLY angry with me. That I should've forced her to accept the phone for free because I had better income and Fran needs the money.

Apparently, I'm economically abusing her by having her clean without paying. 

So AITA? 

I didn't think I was but now I'm doubting myself. 

Additional context:

-- Fran charges $6/hour

-- She has other clients at my apartment complex, when she cleans my home, it's one of several she's got lined up for the day",0,1753976923.0,AITAH,14,0.5,False

[**I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c73i4o/i_27f_found_out_my_boyfriend_33m_is_not_divorced/)

I‚Äôm a mess and on mobile so I‚Äôm sorry if this makes no sense. My boyfriend of almost 2 years has essentially been living a double life. I‚Äôm baffled as to how he pulled this off. When we met, he told me he was on the tail end of a nasty lengthy divorce, but that he had moved on and it would never pose an issue, and until now he was right, it never has. Last week I took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning I had a OBGYN visit to confirm. I was honestly ecstatic, I‚Äôve always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven‚Äôt been together for the longest time. 

I was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. His face went pale and he looked confused, not what I expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn‚Äôt know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. Not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he‚Äôs been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. 

I have no idea how I never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. That being said, it‚Äôs not like he hardly spent any time with me. I‚Äôm heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. I‚Äôm still pregnant, with his third child, and he‚Äôs still very much married. He left right after that conversation, and I‚Äôve called and texted but the only response I‚Äôve gotten is that he‚Äôll speak to me tomorrow night after work. His demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôs going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. 

Another part of me doesn‚Äôt want him anymore. If he‚Äôs this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? What else COULD he lie about? I also would hate to break up a family like this. I feel disgusted in this whole situation, I‚Äôve never felt more alone and confused. Should I be preemptive and leave him or are there other ways I could go about this?

**Update:** I think it‚Äôs clear that I need to leave him, but that‚Äôs about all that‚Äôs clear for me right now. I want to be a mom, but these are the worst circumstances for that that I can imagine. I‚Äôm trying to think of ways to contact his wife and can‚Äôt think of any. I do believe I was at the house where they once lived at one point, but he has moved since then (allegedly) so I have no idea what the new address is. I can‚Äôt seem to piece this together at all. I don‚Äôt understand how I was fooled for so long, I think I‚Äôm still in shock. To recap, I am leaving, I‚Äôm not sure if I want to abort, and as much as I want to tell his wife I have no way of doing that. I guess I‚Äôll wait until he speaks with me tomorrow. Thank you guys, if you‚Äôd like updates I‚Äôll keep posting.

**UPDATE 2:** I found his wife through a website someone sent me. He wasn‚Äôt lying when he said he had no social media, but she does. Seeing the pictures of them made me realize I cannot keep our child, his family is beautiful and it breaks my heart to know he could do this to them, I cannot have the father of my child be someone like him. I still have no idea how to tell his wife.

>End your relationship with him and decide what you are going to do about your pregnancy. If you are going to have a baby and be a mom, you will at some point have to inform his family so you can get child support. I suggest talking to a lawyer before you do anything because you could easily financially screw this up for your kid's future.

>If you are going to abort, then the question about telling his wife is a different beast. I personally would because I think she needs to know the type of person she is so she can protect herself and in part for petty revenge.

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7kx6t/update_i_27f_found_out_my_boyfriend_33m_is_not/) - *A day later*

So I wanted to get this up as soon as possible because honestly, I never want to think about this again. I met with my ex this morning instead of after work because I guess neither of us could wait any longer to end this nightmare. I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs true and what isn‚Äôt, all I know is my life has been pretty much torn to shreds. I went from confirming my pregnancy to this mess in basically no time at all, the last 24 hours have been the hardest of my life.

Before I get into the conversation I had with my ex, I wanted to clear up a couple points that people kept bringing up: yes, I‚Äôve been to ‚Äúhis‚Äù house. I‚Äôll explain the quotations better. We both work a lot, and I never really minded never spending much time at his place. His story was that after his ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù he was left with the house to himself and he got some roommates, he was kinda touchy about the subject but we talked about it once and it had to do with feeling weird about having roommates in his 30s. He was allegedly in the process of selling the joke after his roommates left, so we stopped going there often since it was semi packed up. Made enough sense to me, and since I live alone I always preferred him being at my place anyway. So no, I didn‚Äôt spend two years not knowing where my boyfriend lived, I spent a year and 7 months simply spending more time at my place together.

The second point is how I got pregnant in the first place. We didn‚Äôt plan for a baby, we didn‚Äôt try for a baby. We simply decided that if it happened, it happened. He had this whole mentality about living in the moment and happy accidents and such, supposedly due to how his marriage ‚Äúended‚Äù. So, I stopped using birth control and he would sometimes not use condoms. Come on guys, accidental pregnancies happen all the time.

The last point is about my decision to terminate this pregnancy. I don‚Äôt care about anyone else‚Äôs stance on abortion, this is MY life and MY choice. For reasons that‚Äôll become clearer when I get to how my conversation with my ex went, this is the most painful and confusing thing I‚Äôve ever dealt with. Yes I‚Äôd love to be a mother, but I‚Äôm in no rush. I know things rarely turn out as planned, but this is a terrible environment to bring a child into, and I‚Äôm not subjecting my child to the emotional turmoil I‚Äôm currently going through. I cannot have a healthy pregnancy with the state of mind I‚Äôm in right now, and I‚Äôd rather put this behind me and wait to raise a child with someone who truly loves me so they can have the life they deserve. It‚Äôd be selfish to have the baby just because it‚Äôs what I want, I have to think about what‚Äôs best for my future child, and this is not it. Since this all happened so quickly, it‚Äôs literally been a day since the bomb dropped, I‚Äôll take some more time to think about it, but I think my stance is firm.

Now onto what you all came for.

I spoke to my ex first over the phone, and later outside of a coffee shop, I took y‚Äôall‚Äôs advice to not be with him alone. I have no idea if any of what he told me was true, but I plan on never speaking to him again so it‚Äôs the closest to the truth I‚Äôll ever get. His demeanor was very... odd. He looked almost close to tears but his tone and what he was saying was cold and emotionless and almost like he was debriefing me and not apologizing.

Here is his story: his wife and him got married 10 years ago when she got pregnant, she was 18 at the time and her family is very Christian, so they married while she was pregnant and she eventually lost the child. Since then, he‚Äôs felt trapped in his marriage but couldn‚Äôt bring himself to leave as he describes his wife as a very sweet, innocent, and fragile person with very strong views on marriage and very high hopes for the relationship.

After having their two kids, she became very focused on them and he started to stray from his marriage at this point. He claims that it wasn‚Äôt until he met me that he realized just how dead his marriage was. Being the coward he is, instead of leaving his wife, he decided to just start another life with me, completely separately.

This is where his lies started to get messy. He does have a job, but it turns out he works from home, so that‚Äôs where he was when he was ‚Äúat the office‚Äù. His coworkers/work friends I met are kind of like partners, but their all independent and don‚Äôt see each other too much, which is why he was okay introducing them to me, they had no idea about his wife. In hindsight I was very stupid to never think about meeting more of his friends, but neither of us are extremely social. While with me, he would tell his wife that he was out with clients, running errands, or on business trips, all things he did legitimately have to do for his job.

The house I visited wasn‚Äôt his, which is why there was no sign of children. It‚Äôs his brother‚Äôs house, he works out of town a lot so when I‚Äôd be over would be when my ex was housesitting. His story about moving in with roommates after his divorce? That‚Äôs actually what happened to his brother, it was his brother that was in the process of selling his house after his roommates left, not him. So it turns out he does have family nearby. It gets more complicated, too much to type out, but his web of lies is very detailed, very well thought out, and unfortunately for everyone but him very well executed, somewhat through sheer dumb luck, but I‚Äôm 1000% sure he‚Äôs had practice living a double life.

This could all be lies, but this next part is the strangest to me. He claims that when we had the conversation to stop birth control and have kids, he had a different conversation with himself. He decided he was happier with me, and if a baby came along, that‚Äôs when he would cut things off with his wife. But that makes no sense, would he be cutting off his children too? Was he planning on ever telling me? He said that when that moment came and he found out I am pregnant, he felt unexpected panic and reconsidered his life, and decided he couldn‚Äôt leave his family. I guess that explains the confusion on his face when I told him.

He then came to the conclusion that the best course of action would be to end things with me and ask me to get an abortion, and we‚Äôd be on our merry ways and he could go back to his normal life, he still thinks I have no way of knowing who his wife is and have no way of contacting her. NOPE. Though he doesn‚Äôt need to worry about having a third kid, I cannot in good conscience let this man continue to lie to his wife, who sounds completely clueless. I took the advice of one of you and recorded the conversation on my phone. 

It‚Äôs a garbage recording but there‚Äôs just enough that‚Äôs audible to keep as evidence. I‚Äôm going to spend some time compiling all I have and thinking of ways I could help her out of her disaster of a marriage, and then I will contact her. The reason I wanna help is because i feel I am playing a part in the ending of her marriage and I feel obligated to help if she‚Äôll allow me. I did not give him any indication that I‚Äôd be doing this. I told him I just wanted to never see him again and leave this in the past, which is true... but i want his wife to make the same decision.

Im sorry for the novel of an update, thank you every one for your love and support. I missed so many red flags, about his friends, his family, his home, everything, but I was blindly in love and hindsight is 20/20. So much of this still doesn‚Äôt make sense and never will, and a part of me believes that his explanations and confessions are fabricated and the truth is a lot messier, but I‚Äôll never know so i can‚Äôt hold on to that. I‚Äôm considering moving to put this all behind me. Again, I wanna thank you guys so much for your input and guidance, my brain is still such a mess and it‚Äôll take a long time to heal, but you guys have helped me go towards the right direction.

>I'm so sorry you're going through this. Don't kid yourself that she's going to want your help though. Odds are she will partly blame you for everything he's done and will want nothing to do with you. She may even decide to stay with him, even after knowing everything. You said she is from a Christian background and they often put forgiveness above everything and stay married for the sake of the children, no matter how angry and unhappy they are. So don't be surprised if she blows up on you and defends him.

[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9lzkc/final_update_i_27f_found_out_my_boyfriend_33m_is/) - *5 Days later*

Short update because I realize it kind of seems like I left you guys hanging.

First I‚Äôd like to address that the pregnancy was not unexpected but not explicitly planned. ‚ÄúAccidental‚Äù was not the right word, but I‚Äôm aware of how babies are made. I was in a sense trying to get pregnant, but only because my ex lied to me and convinced me he was onboard. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and explain the ins and outs of how I was duped, I was stupid and missed some flags but I absolutely planned on bringing a child into what I expected would be a healthy, safe, loving environment.

That environment is not real. I am not ready to be a mother under the current circumstances, I am not mentally or emotionally fit to carry out a pregnancy, and I am most definitely not going to put a child through the adoption system. It is just not a guarantee of a good life and I can‚Äôt in good conscience do that. For those and other reasons I‚Äôve explained before, I have begun the process of getting an abortion.

I collected photographs, videos, screenshots of texts, and everything I could find as evidence to show my ex‚Äôs wife. I tried to find texts in which he referenced being divorced or just any lies to prove that I‚Äôm not at fault, but I heeded yalls warnings to not try and help her or push her too far since I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôd receive these news. I simply found her on social media, sent her all the pictures and screenshots, and a short run down of what her husbands been doing for 2 years. It took a day for her to respond but all she said was ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and once I saw that, I blocked her.

I have not heard from anyone and I hope to never have to hear or think about this situation again. It‚Äôs behind me. I have no idea what happened with my ex and his wife, and I probably never will.

Thank you guys for your support.

Since I started testing it, I have subjected it to everything from kids' grass-stained soccer uniforms to my partner‚Äôs delicate work blouses. With 112 pods in the package, each promising a hypoallergenic and effective clean, I was curious how well these detergent pods would live up to their stellar 4.8-star rating and glowing reputation.

**Ease of Use and Compact Design**  
One of the best things about these detergent pods is their convenience. Each pac is pre-measured, which means no more fussing over pouring the right amount of liquid detergent or dealing with messy spills. I‚Äôm pretty bad at measuring detergent ‚Äújust right,‚Äù so having these tiny, pre-packed pods feels like a laundry cheat code. You simply toss a pod directly into the washing machine drum before putting your clothes in. It‚Äôs a no-brainer‚Äîefficient, mess-free, and quick. Despite being compact, these pods do pack a punch, making them ideal for anyone tight on space, like dorm room dwellers or apartment residents.

[Find the best price for Tide 3229 PODS Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent Soap Pacs on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0btkkjlls/)

**Performance and Effectiveness on Stains**  
As someone who constantly battles coffee drips, food smudges, and the occasional grease stain, I was impressed by how well the pods tackled these challenges. They claim to work on 100% of common stains, and they weren‚Äôt kidding. From red wine splatters on a white blouse to a toddler‚Äôs ketchup-covered t-shirt, the pods cleaned fabrics effectively without any residue left behind. Even in cold water washes‚Äîwhich saves electricity, by the way‚Äîthey still delivered excellent results. I tested them across various fabric types such as cotton towels, silk scarves, and synthetic gym wear, and they performed consistently well with zero fabric damage.

**Hypoallergenic Properties and Gentle Formula**  
With this product being free of dyes and perfumes, it‚Äôs enormously appealing to those with sensitive skin or allergies. Hypoallergenic detergent is critical in my household because my son has eczema, and we‚Äôve had bad experiences with detergents that leave irritating residues. These pods have the trusted NEA (National Eczema Association) and NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation) certifications, and I can confirm they live up to their promise. After several washes, there were no rashes or itchy discomforts‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt just a win for my son, but also for my peace of mind.

**Strengths**  
- Hypoallergenic and safe for sensitive skin.  
- Works effectively in both cold and hot water settings.  
- Stain remover power delivers on its promise for 100% of common stains.  
- Dye-free and perfume-free formula means no irritating residues.  

**Downsides**  
- The lack of scent might bother users who enjoy a subtle fragrance in their laundry.  
- These pods are not as budget-friendly as traditional liquid detergents.  

**Versatility and Water Efficiency**  
Another standout feature is the pods‚Äô adaptability. These detergent pacs can work in all types of washing machines, including High Efficiency (HE) models, without a hiccup. I put this to the test by using them in my moderately high-end washer and my in-laws‚Äô older machine during a weekend visit. Across both setups, the cleaning results were nearly identical. Furthermore, the pods work in varying water conditions, whether hard or soft, which is handy if you move frequently or manage laundry in different locations. The ability to clean effectively in colder water also makes the pods an energy-efficient choice, reducing the need for heated cycles.

**Rival Brands**  
When looking at products like Gain Flings! and Arm & Hammer Power Paks, the differences are evident. Gain Flings! offers excellent cleaning results with a strong scent, but it doesn‚Äôt cater well to households with sensitive skin. Arm & Hammer, on the other hand, stands out for affordability but isn‚Äôt nearly as efficient in tackling oil-based stains. Compared to these contenders, Tide Free & Gentle is leagues ahead in balancing performance, gentleness, and ease of use. That said, if you‚Äôre after intense fragrance, it may feel lacking. However, those prioritizing hypoallergenic solutions will find this to be the superior contender.

**Price Worthiness**  
While these detergent pods are priced higher than bulk liquid detergents or powdered alternatives, I find the convenience, hypoallergenic properties, and consistent stain-fighting power justify the investment. Add in the fact that every load turns out clean and residue-free with minimal measuring effort, and it becomes hard to argue against its value. Of course, large families requiring frequent loads may feel the pinch, but for smaller households or those willing to trade a bit of budget for peace of mind, it‚Äôs worth every penny.

1me52bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/1me52bh/a_simple_exercise_in_selfawareness_that_could/,A simple exercise in self-awareness that could change how you understand yourself,"Close your eyes for a moment and think of a memory from childhood that fills you with a deep, almost magical sense of meaning. Perhaps it's your grandmother's kitchen on a Sunday morning, the sound of rain on your bedroom window, or the way afternoon light fell across your school playground. Notice how that memory isn‚Äôt just a recollection of the past‚Äîit carries something more profound, an almost mystical quality that feels both wonderful and somehow unreachable.

What you're experiencing isn't simply nostalgia. You're witnessing a fundamental force of human psychology in action‚Äîone that has been shaping your desires, emotions, and life choices since you were small, yet remains largely unrecognised.

# The Mystery Behind Your Most Meaningful Moments

That sense of inexplicable specialness you just felt? It has a name:¬†[**hagioptasia**](https://hagioptasia.wordpress.com/)¬†(pronounced ‚ÄòHag-ee-op-TAY-see-uh‚Äô), meaning ‚Äòholy vision‚Äô. It's your mind's tendency to perceive certain people, places, objects, or thoughts as possessing an otherworldly quality of significance‚Äîas if they're touched by something transcendent.

Here's what makes this discovery so remarkable: while many of your experiences of hagioptasia relate to your childhood, it isn't only about the past. It's a perceptual mechanism that's actively working right now, transforming ordinary experiences into sources of profound meaning. Your nostalgic memories are simply the easiest place to observe it in action.

# A Simple Test: Watching Your Mind Create Magic

Try this revealing exercise:

**Step 1:**¬†Think of three specific childhood memories that feel especially meaningful or ""magical"" to you. Not just happy memories, but ones that seem to glow with significance.

**Step 2:**¬†Now ask yourself honestly: Were these moments actually extraordinary when they happened? Or were they fairly ordinary experiences that have somehow acquired a deep sense of specialness over time?

**Step 3:**¬†Notice the paradox: You can intellectually recognise that these were probably quite mundane moments (a typical Tuesday afternoon, an unremarkable conversation, playing in a garden), yet they continue to feel profoundly special despite this rational understanding.

This is hagioptasia at work. Your mind has taken ordinary experiences and imbued them with a quality of ""specialness"" that feels completely real and external‚Äîas if the magic exists in the actual place or event, rather than being created by your perception.

# Why This Matters More Than You Think

Once you learn to recognise hagioptasia in your nostalgic memories, you'll start seeing it everywhere:

* That inexplicable allure of celebrities and status symbols
* The way certain places (a favorite caf√©, a scenic viewpoint) seem to possess an almost sacred atmosphere
* Your attraction to vintage items, heirloom objects, or things with ""history""
* The transcendent quality you perceive in music, art, or literature that moves you so deeply

This isn't mere sentimentality or cultural conditioning. Research involving nearly 3,000 people has shown that around 80% of us experience this perceptual tendency from early childhood. It's a fundamental feature of human psychology, rooted in our evolutionary heritage.

# The Evolutionary Story Hidden in Your Feelings

Why would our minds be wired this way? The answer lies deep in our evolutionary past. Hagioptasia likely evolved as a sophisticated guidance system‚Äîa way of marking certain experiences, places, and relationships as significant and worth returning to or seeking out.

Consider how your nostalgic feelings often center around:

* Your childhood home and family
* Seasonal celebrations and traditions
* Moments of safety, comfort, and belonging

But hagioptasia also extends to social dynamics in ways that mirror other species. Just as male deer are instinctively drawn to impressive antler displays, or peahens respond to elaborate tail feathers, humans automatically perceive ‚Äúspecialness‚Äù in high-status individuals‚Äîcelebrities, leaders, successful peers. This same mechanism that makes childhood memories glow with meaning also drives hero worship, status anxiety, and competitive envy.

These patterns aren't random. They represent exactly the kinds of experiences and social perceptions that would have enhanced survival and wellbeing for our ancestors. The sense of ‚Äòspecialness‚Äô was evolution's way of saying: ‚ÄúPay attention to this. Value this. Seek more of this‚Äîwhether it's a safe haven or a powerful ally.‚Äù

# The Double-Edged Gift

Understanding hagioptasia reveals both its benefits and its potential pitfalls:

**The Gift:**¬†This mechanism allows us to find profound meaning and beauty in ordinary life. It's the source of our deepest aesthetic experiences, our capacity for awe, and our ability to form lasting emotional bonds with places and people.

**The Challenge:**¬†Because hagioptasia operates automatically and feels completely real, we often mistake its effects for external truth. We chase after things‚Äîcareers, possessions, relationships, experiences‚Äîbelieving they possess the specialness we perceive, only to find ourselves disappointed when reality doesn't match our hagioptasic expectations.

# A Path to Wiser Living

Here's the transformative insight: Recognising hagioptasia doesn't diminish the beauty of your experiences‚Äîit enhances your agency in creating them.

**Before awareness:**¬†‚ÄúI need to recapture that magical feeling from my past‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf I could just achieve \[goal\], I'd have that sense of specialness in my life‚Äù.

**After awareness:**¬†‚ÄúI have a natural capacity to perceive specialness, and I can cultivate this in my present experience rather than chasing illusions‚Äù.

This shift is profound. Instead of viewing your current life as somehow lacking compared to an idealised past or future, you can recognise that the source of magic was always within your own perception. The song of a blackbird in your garden today is just as worthy of that sense of wonder as any blackbird from your childhood‚Äîif you allow yourself to see it.

# Practical Steps to Harness Your Hagioptasia

1. **Practice Present-Moment Awareness:**¬†When you catch yourself feeling nostalgic, ask: ‚ÄúWhat would it be like to experience this same quality of specialness right now, in this moment?‚Äù
2. **Question Your Pursuits:**¬†Before making life decisions motivated by a sense that something will bring you that elusive ‚Äúspecial‚Äù feeling, pause and consider whether you're chasing a hagioptasic projection.
3. **Cultivate Gratitude for the Ordinary:**¬†Deliberately practice seeing the ‚Äòspecialness‚Äô in everyday experiences‚Äîyour morning coffee, a conversation with a friend, the quality of light in your room.
4. **Recognise Cultural Manipulation:**¬†Notice how advertising, social media, and status cultures exploit your hagioptasic tendencies by promising that their products or lifestyles will deliver that sense of specialness.

# The Deeper Invitation

Understanding hagioptasia isn't about becoming cynical or losing your sense of wonder. Quite the opposite. It's about reclaiming your power to experience meaning and beauty on your own terms, rather than being unconsciously driven by ancient psychological mechanisms or cultural forces seeking to exploit them.

Your nostalgic memories have been trying to teach you something important all along: You possess a remarkable capacity to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary. The question isn't whether this capacity is ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúillusory‚Äù‚Äîit's how you'll choose to use it.

Will you spend your life chasing after projections of specialness that exist mainly in your perception? Or will you learn to consciously cultivate that same sense of wonder and meaning in your actual, present-moment experience?

The choice, as always, is yours. But now, at least, it's a conscious one.",1,1753976704.0,cogsci,2,0.67,False
1me51nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1me51nh/find_out_if_the_shardor_km802g_coffee_maker_truly/,Find Out if the SHARDOR KM802G Coffee Maker Truly Delivers in This Review,"**My Experience with SHARDOR KM802G Hot & Iced K-Cup Coffee Maker**

Purchasing the SHARDOR KM802G Hot & Iced K-Cup Coffee Maker felt like a natural choice for someone like me who thrives on caffeine. As someone who juggles work deadlines and a household, I rely on coffee to keep me sharp. This machine promised versatility, convenience, and efficiency, and I couldn't wait to brew my first cup. A mix of excitement and skepticism filled the air‚Äîafter all, it had a lot to live up to. 

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker was the modern and compact design. The dark gray finish paired well with my kitchen's minimalist aesthetic, making the machine blend in effortlessly on my countertop. Its sleek build doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, which is ideal for smaller kitchens or shared workspaces. Despite its lightweight construction at 4.84 pounds, the materials feel sturdy enough to withstand daily use. The 11.46-inch depth and 11.93-inch width make it easy to tuck away, but honestly, it looks great sitting out.

**User-Friendly Features**

This device offers straight-to-the-point operation with a fully automatic mode. Even my technophobic aunt managed to figure it out on her first try‚Äîpraise-worthy! Notable mention goes to its reusable filter, enabling me to choose between using my favorite ground coffee or K-Cups. The removable drip tray also was a savior for my taller travel mugs, supporting up to 6.8 inches in cup height. Though I forgot once and hilariously spilled coffee all over the counter due to a mismatched mug size‚Äîlesson learned.

[Grab SHARDOR KM802G at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0drbm88h3/)

**Positives**

- Dual-brew strength setting lets me choose between standard and stronger brews, catering to both mild coffee lovers and caffeine junkies like me.  
- 52 oz removable water reservoir is a blessing; I often brew multiple cups during work hours without needing constant refills.  
- Versatility shines with its 3-in-1 compatibility: K-pods, ground coffee, and even tea!  
- Brew capacities ranging from 6 oz to 14 oz offer flexibility depending on my mood or caffeine need.  
- Energy-saving auto-off feature ensures I don‚Äôt wake up in a panic wondering if I left the machine on.  

**Performance Under Pressure**

Whether it‚Äôs brewing a hot caffeine fix in the morning or an iced latte in summer, this machine excels. It claims to brew coffee in about a minute, and I can confirm the wait time is very reasonable. My mornings were never disrupted by sluggish wait times. I tested both iced and hot brew settings extensively, and to my delight, the flavor didn‚Äôt get watered down even with iced coffee. That ""bold setting""? It truly delivers a richer, more robust cup, although using high-quality beans helped bring out the best.

**Disadvantages**

- While the unit is visually appealing, the plastic components, though durable, feel a tad flimsy compared to higher-end coffee makers.  
- The brewing process occasionally splashes a tiny bit of coffee if the mug is not positioned perfectly.  
- A slight learning curve exists when switching between filter types, as you need to ensure the capsule holders or filters are placed correctly to avoid brewing mishaps.  

**Competing Products**

Having previously used household names like Keurig and Hamilton Beach coffee makers, I'd say this machine holds its own fairly well. Keurig machines cater to quick brewing but don‚Äôt offer the flexibility of using both ground coffee and pod options without additional attachments. While Hamilton Beach models are usually budget-friendly, they often lack the sleek design and robust brewing options that this machine brings to the table. However, I did find the SHARDOR slightly noisier compared to Keurig machines during operation. What it lacks in silence, it makes up for in versatility and flavor consistency.

**Cost Efficiency**

Value-wise, this coffee maker offers a lot for its price. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest unit out there, the features pay for themselves, especially if you‚Äôre an everyday coffee drinker like me. Owning a versatile machine that accommodates both K-Cups and ground coffee means you save by not being locked into expensive pods. The energy-saving auto-off function further adds to its cost efficiency over time. For all its perks, it feels like you're squeezing the maximum utility out of every penny spent.

And when you¬¥re up you need to crouch, \[C\] on PC, to get off the ladder and slide to the side. Now you can stand up and turn around to see the most beautiful view of the lake. The top floor is your bedroom, with a nice huge TV (also fully functional, try it). The bedroom also has some other cool stuff for you, make sure to look everywhere.

[The world's best view?](https://preview.redd.it/41fo9wtlc8gf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be836975c133d1a28992d6f37ec9b30fa47fc119)



  
Returning back down just to discover that your mocca isn't done? Or maybe you never got it to start in the first place? And why wouldn't the TV start? I think you know what is going on here, take a look around outside the cottage and you¬¥ll find out what the problem is.

Another little problem you¬¥ll surely run in to is the running water in your kitchen. It¬¥s not running. This is a bit more complicated to fix right now this early on in the game, but you'll be able to solve it later. You just have to pump your water for now. Approach the pump and use \[Q\] and \[E\] with for example a bucket or the coffee pan placed under it to fill it.

While there are a lot of great and useful tips & tricks that can be found on forum threads online and videos on YouTube, the game really doesn't show you much (and that¬¥s what I like about it), you have to try things out, explore. You don't have to worry about food for example, or sleep or health, even though you can die from various reasons (drowning was just recently added in one of the June/July updates). You can however eat and drink. And depending on what you put inside you, you'll get different results haha, and you should try it out!

**To cover some basics of this game, like controls and gameplay, these are the things I consider are the most important ones to remember:**

There is no autosave. There is only one way to save, and only in specific places: the Cottage. You can save when going into 'Sleep mode' in your upstairs bed or in the couch on the bottom floor kitchen, and choosing 'Save' in the menu. In that menu you can also sleep to change the time of day. This makes you having to think extra about saving your game before heading out on exploration. Inside Pekka and Juha's house there is also a couch that works just like yours.

When interacting with objects there are basically two types of interaction, and they are shown when pointing/looking at them. You can either 'Pick up' \[1\] or \[E\], or 'Equip' \[2\]. Picking up shows the object in front of you, and you can then place on the ground or a table for example, by holding \[E\] which places/drops it. Equipping an object makes you hold it in your hand. Not all objects can be equipped. Another way of doing this is by first pressing \[E\] and then pressing \[E\] again, right after. This makes you first pick up the object and when it¬¥s picked up you can equip it. An equipped object can also be unequipped by pressing \[E\], which results in it being in the 'picked up mode'. Pressing \[E\] toggles the object being picked up or equipped. The last thing you can do with any object in 'picked up mode' is by right clicking the mouse, which throws the object away.

You can have things in your pockets. You bring these up by pressing \[B\] which then shows options for it. Some things/objects you find, you can put in your pocket. This is done by pressing \[B\] when equipped and then there is a option for it in the 'pocket menu'.

You have a journal, press \[B\] and then \[1\] to bring it up. It's a notebook that has a small map taped in it, as well as notes that the game puts in for you. You also have a recipe for Kilju and the Moped fuel/Oil ratio in there from the start of your game. More on those things later on.

You've already found out earlier that you have a mobile phone. simply press \[B\] and then \[2\] to bring it up. It's very nice to have, to be able to see what time it is. To call someone you just press \[Enter\] when you're holding the phone, this brings up the menu, hit \[Enter\] again (Contacts\] and you can use the up and down arrow to choose who to call, then hit \[Enter\] to call. The battery depletes, and it can be charged in your cottage, the charging cord is on the kitchen table.

Guns. Yes, there are guns in the game! They're just like any object in the game, you pick them up or equip them. They need ammo just like real guns. And they're also point and shoot, just like real guns. How to get more ammo then? More on that later on.

Which then brings us to the animal life in the game. There are animals. You'll most probably run into some of them sooner or later and they can all be hunted/shot/killed. A killed animal leaves meat. But to care of this you need to handle it ('Skin' is the game's term). This is done by pointing/looking at the dead animal with a knife equipped and pressing \[1\] or \[E\]. Different animals yield different amounts of meat. The meat can then be either eaten (raw or cooked) or sold. More on that later. But what if, you run across one of these animals for example, kill it with your euipped gun and then what? You can't have both your gun and your knife with you at the same time. In this example, early game, you have to run back to your cottage and leave your gun and then equip your knife (which is in the the Sauna if you haven¬¥t checked), and (it respawns btw, also good to know). Then you have to run back to the animal you've killed to 'Skin' it with your knife. Then you have to transport the pieces of meat back to your cottage, one by one. And you can't have the knife equipped while doing it. This quickly gets kind of complicated, and maybe why you should wait just a bit with this, atleast actively going hunting. There is a much easier way to this further on in the game. And that's right, more on that later on also! However, if you stumble upon an animal close to your cottage or even one right on your yard, (that has happened, more than once!) then I'd say go for it, because this game is also about money and you're gonna be needing money later on. The pieces of meat can just be put anywhere in your cottage or even shed if you want it to. Or you can put it in the fridge, just like in real life. The meat doesn't spoil however, if you don't put it in the fridge.

That makes for a good part 1, I think.

I'm sitting for a client I've sat with before quite a few times, as in we are familiar with each other. Her dog and I are not strangers. They have a French Bulldog. He's usually pretty okay, but they absolutely haven't trained this dog well enough. 

He's supposed to be walked thrice daily, and yesterday evening and this morning every time I tell him it's time for a walk he gets excited and follows me to the front door, but the second I grab his harness he runs away to cower under the coffee table. Stay command, treats, taking it slow, nothing's working. Any time I am holding the harness in my hand he runs under the coffee table. 

I'm pretty chatty with the owner and let her know that he's running away and won't walk. She tells me to leave the front door open and go sit outside and eventually he'll follow. She's also stated that he is a flight risk‚Äîbut she's pissed that he's not going for his walks. I mean what the hell do I do? My gut says no way am I leaving the door wide open to try and goad this dog into going for a walk, but also man this owner is peeved. I want him to go for a walk! 

Do I just accept this dog is an asshole and keep trying again later or is there something I'm not seeing? ",2,1753976459.0,petsitting,7,1.0,False

TL;DR How do I deal with doing student hours at a successful company i wanna work at in the future whose CEO‚Äôs daughter is a girl i used to be close with but eventually she didn‚Äôt like me cuz of her toxic friends?

How do i 20M, a communications uni 2nd - 3rd year student deal with having to do my placement UNPAID 100 hours minimum at a very successful company which i never thought to be in, but the CEO is the mother of a girl who i don‚Äôt think she likes me 20F as she switched up on me as soon as i had false accusations with a friend group i fought with in the course and i had to deal with being alone in the course for over a year now.

I love this company as it improved me so much, everyone loves me, the CEO initially liked me but i try not to annoy her lol, but she‚Äôs sweet and kind with me, occasionally she looks at me and brings her daughter to work and i try not o make eye contact. What do i do in this case? 

How do i live? I‚Äôm struggling thinking after the 100 unpaid hours pass they‚Äôll just leave me, or the ceo Hates my guts too eventually which makes me sad as i put a lot of effort and trial, im scared, i never even wanted to silently argue with her daughter as we were very close and i even offered to take her to a picnic sushi day and she accepted, and she used to message me opening up too about her life 

This is not only for my failed friendship with her due to red flags lying about my name saying i‚Äôm on a register or restraining order and having my letters to my ex during g breakup exposed when they are in coffee shops gossiping about others.

I need to know what i can do as i love this career opportunity as a student even though it‚Äôs unpaid. i‚Äôm not expecting to sign you know.. but still, it‚Äôs a great company for me and i want to make friendships with her and not having to ignore her, i ignore her so i don‚Äôt harass her because im not a harasser.

I‚Äôm a 28y F, 5‚Äô7‚Äù and currently at 258lbs. I started working out (at home) 4-5X a week, typically taking Saturday and Sunday off, and I started on May 15th. So I‚Äôm a little over 2 months in.  I started out at 260lbs, and actually climbed to 265lbs and am now as of this morning down to 258lbs. The at home workouts I‚Äôve been doing are a mix of cardio and strength, I follow this girl on YouTube that does great workouts and is very motivational. I‚Äôve definitely noticed certain muscles are much more toned. I certainly feel stronger and more energetic, which is great. But I guess I just expected to be able to SEE a little more progress by now, whether by physically looking at my body, or seeing the scale go down. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it was a bit discouraging when I climbed back up to 265. My husband tried to reassure me that I was likely gaining muscle and that was why, but idk how true that is. The exercises I‚Äôve been doing have also been getting easier to do with time, so I think that‚Äôs a good sign. I‚Äôve been struggling to fully understand the whole calorie deficit thing. I get the concept, but don‚Äôt really understand how I‚Äôm supposed to know how many calories I‚Äôm burning with each workout. I‚Äôve tried not to focus too hard on that, and just ensure that I‚Äôm eating better. I typically eat Greek yogurt with protein granola for breakfast, eggs with some veggies mixed in for lunch, and then dinner is typically where I‚Äôll eat a little ‚Äúheavier‚Äù with some carbs, protein and veggies. I‚Äôve been trying not to overeat at dinner as well, as that was always one of my struggles. And also trying not to eat as late as I used to. I‚Äôve drastically cut back on snacks, and when I do snack it‚Äôs typically a veggie, or like a banana or an apple with peanut butter. I‚Äôve almost completely cut out soda, only having a bottle of root beer a few times a week or a coffee from Dunkin occasionally. And I also only eat out 1 sometimes 2 times a week now, usually on the weekend when my husbands home and we just wanna chill for the day. And even then, I try to pick the healthiest option they have. Overall I feel like I‚Äôm eating much better. (I used to basically only eat dinner, not eat all day long, and then want multiple snacks late at night so it‚Äôs drastically different). I had 2 back to back pregnancies, and that‚Äôs where all my weight gain came from. Prior to this, I was around 180-190 and I was comfortable with that. I do some workouts geared towards fixing diastasis recti which I‚Äôve noticed a huge difference in as well. I‚Äôm happy with the little wins im seeing, as far as the few spots in my body that I can tell are stronger and more toned, as well as feeling better physically and more energetic. I just really hoped to be losing a bit more by now. I know it takes time, but being almost 3 months in and barely seeing the scale go down just makes me wonder if I‚Äôm doing something wrong?

I hope you enjoy your time in our fair city. Here are some tips for getting around, and where you should get to!

# Getting Around

>***Pacers Bikeshare.*** Indianapolis has a city-bike program, with e-bikes! You can use the bikes by downloading the BCycle app.

>***Scooters.*** If you live in a city, you see these everywhere. They‚Äôre very easy to use! You‚Äôll just need to download the app for these (Lime or Bird) and enter your payment info.

>***Cultural Trail.*** Indianapolis has a network of wide brick sidewalks/trails that you can use to safely get around the city, and it‚Äôs connected directly to the Convention Center. You can find the map of the trail [here](https://indyculturaltrail.org/map/)!

# Places to Go

>**Near Downtown (Walk)**  
While downtown isn‚Äôt as lively as it used to be, there are still gems scattered around here and there. A few of my favorites are below.

>***Wei Ramen.*** Huge bowls of delicious, authentic ramen, and anime to watch while you eat.

>***Asian Harbor.*** An underrated, quiet restaurant that carries affordable, far-eastern cuisine.

>***Lincoln Square Pancake House.*** A small, cozy diner with classic Indiana entrees (try the tenderloin!) and breakfast.  
***Monument Circle.*** Right now, a quarter of Monument Circle has been converted into a pop-up park! Relax here, play some Giant Jenga, and maybe grab a bite nearby.

>**Massachusetts Ave. (Bike or Scooter)**  
Mass Ave is the nearest and greatest historical neighborhood to the Convention Center, host to a number of fun shops, walkable communities, and great local eats. A few of my favorites are listed below.

>***Chatham Tap.*** Delicious, large helpings of traditional pub food, with an English flair.

>***Salt & Ash.*** Just northeast of Mass Ave, you'll find the Factory Arts District (referred to endearingly as FARTS. Salt & Ash is a local shop where you can find excellent bath supplies, such as perfumes, bath bombs, and soaps. Like a Lush or a Bath & Body Works

>***Silver in the City.*** A cozy gift shop that carries cute trinkets, silver jewlery, and LGBTQ+ items.

>**Fountain Square (Bike or Scooter)**  
My favorite cultural hub near downtown, Fountain Square offers a little bit of everything.

>***Tappers Arcade & Bar.*** Tasty, affordable drinks and custom cocktails. Buy a drink, and play all the games for free! They've got a huge selection, from Smash Bros, to NBA Jam, and Game Cubes that have an emulator for all the classics.

>***World Famous Hotboys.*** They weren‚Äôt lying with their brand name. The chicken here is seriously good. My wife and I like to get loaded fries and split them.

>***Loco.*** This is your standard mid-tier Mexican faire. Grab a margarita, an enchilada, and beat the heat.

>***Elf & Moon.*** Probably the best local game store in the city. They also sell themed scented candles!

>**Near Eastside (Bike or Scooter)**  
Not the most beautiful area in the city, but it‚Äôs seriously on the come-up, and home to plenty of great food options. They‚Äôre building a protected Bike Lane on New York Street, and it‚Äôs the safest way to get there on foot, scooter, or bike.

>***King Dough.*** A local pizza joint with oven-fired pies that‚Äôll knock your socks off. I recommend the Destroyer, comboed with a Bramble Mule.

>***Futuro.*** Detroit-style deep-dish. A lot of people swear by this place, and the dining area is small, so you may need to get your food to go.

>***La Parada.*** This is great, affordable Mexican food. One of our favorite locales in the city. The tacos de birria are absolutely to die for.

>***Midlands Antiques.*** This is a great place to grab a souvenir to bring home. They have these really cool anatomical displays of real bugs, like butterflies, stick bugs, and giant beetles.

>**Near Westside (Bike or Scooter)**  
While not as nice as some other places in the city, the Near Westside is home to a few great places to relax, eat, and hang out.

>***7 Coras.*** I know it looks sketch. I know it‚Äôs not in the best neighborhood. But believe me, it‚Äôs some of the best authentic Mexican food you‚Äôll get in the city. I recommend a torta, and a nice frozen margarita to go with it.

>***Guggman Haus + Coffee Haus.*** Tomorrow is Harry Potter Day in the Coffee Haus, and you can come sample a Butter Beer Latte or Italian Sodas themed around the houses of Hogwarts. If coffee isn‚Äôt your thing, slide next door and grab a globally award-winning beer.

>***IU Indy Campus.*** You‚Äôre allowed to just come here and loiter outdoors. In front of Taylor Hall, there‚Äôs a magnificent green space with large lawn chairs that you can use to relax and read as the sun sets, with fairy lights.

# Places to Avoid

>***Circle Center Mall.*** Seriously, there's nothing going on here. It's undergoing renovations, and almost completely dead. You can't even walk around most of it.

>***Chain Restaurants.*** Indy has so many good places to eat, you'd really be wasting your time going to a chain. No Shake Shack, no Condados.

There are so many great places to go. Locals are encouraged to drop recommendations in the comments, because I haven't even come close to covering what's out there!

Four days later the angry red flakes had vanished, my forehead texture smoothed out like I‚Äôd ironed it, and makeup finally stopped clinging to mystery dry patches.

1me4rr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1me4rr6/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_by_brentwood_does/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker by Brentwood Does It Deliver Quality,"Brentwood TS-213W  

I recently got my hands on the Brentwood TS-213W coffee maker‚Äîand let me just say, this little machine has been getting quite the workout in my home. It‚Äôs compact, simple, and does exactly what it promises without unnecessary bells and whistles. Perfect for those early mornings when you just want caffeine in your system without a hassle, am I right? I‚Äôve been running this coffee maker daily, both for myself and when hosting friends or family, and it has proven itself as a reliable kitchen staple.

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**  

The first thing that stood out to me about this coffee maker was its design. It‚Äôs not one of those hulking machines that makes your countertop look cramped; this is small, practical, and dare I say, even a bit cute in its unassuming white finish. Measuring 8 inches deep, 7 inches wide, and 10 inches tall, it‚Äôs perfect for apartments, dorm rooms, or kitchens where space is at a premium. I slid it snugly in a corner of my countertop, and it never feels like it‚Äôs in the way. Its simplicity is refreshing‚ÄîI don‚Äôt feel like it could ever clash with any kitchen d√©cor.  

[Check Brentwood TS-213W deals on Amazon now.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b01cgc9axc/)

**Straightforward Operation**  

Using this coffee maker is straightforward and, honestly, one of the reasons I reach for it over pricier models I‚Äôve tried in the past. Load the grounds into the reusable filter, fill the water reservoir by checking the built-in water level window, and hit the power button. That‚Äôs it‚Äîno need for elaborate setups or complicated processes. Having a manual operation is underrated these days, and Brentwood seems to understand that simplicity can be just as powerful as innovation.  

**Favorable Attributes**  

- Compact and lightweight for easy storage.  
- Built-in water level window for foolproof measuring.  
- Simple one-button operation, no frills!  
- Reusable filter basket, which is eco-friendly and saves money.   

**Reusable Filters Save the Day**  

I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the reusable mesh filter basket that comes with this coffee maker. I‚Äôve tried machines with disposable filters before, and not only is it a pain to remember to buy replacements, but it‚Äôs also wasteful. The reusable basket here works seamlessly, is easy to clean, and makes me feel a tiny bit better about my daily coffee habit. Additionally, the included scooper is a nice touch‚Äîit lets you measure out the coffee grounds to achieve the strength of the brew you're after.  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  

This coffee maker claims to brew 4 cups of coffee per cycle, and while I‚Äôd argue these cups are on the smaller side, it‚Äôs ideal for people like me who enjoy multiple small servings throughout the day. The warming plate is another underrated feature since, let‚Äôs be honest, life often involves distractions. I‚Äôve left coffee on it for an hour while wrangling my kids or answering emails, only to come back and find the coffee still nice and warm. It‚Äôs not industrial-barista level coffee, but for a quick home-brewed cup? Absolutely hits the spot.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- Plastic construction may feel less durable over time.  
- Brew size might disappoint those who drink bigger cups of coffee.  
- The warming plate doesn‚Äôt keep coffee hot for too long.  

**Competing Brands**  

While the Brentwood TS-213W undeniably holds its own, there are other compact coffee makers worth mentioning. For instance, machines like the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker offer similar simplicity but come equipped with an auto-pause feature to fill a mug mid-brew. That‚Äôs a useful addition that the Brentwood lacks. On the flip side, competitors like the Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Coffeemaker focus heavily on larger pours but sacrifice the reusable filter element. Compared to these two, Brentwood feels like the greener, more no-nonsense choice thanks to its eco-conscious components and streamlined design.  

**Bang for the Buck**  

One of the highlights of the Brentwood TS-213W has to be its affordability. It‚Äôs not a machine that breaks the bank, and yet it delivers performance that more than justifies its price tag. Sure, it isn‚Äôt packed with fancy features or high-tech gadgetry, but that‚Äôs exactly its charm. For what you‚Äôre spending, you get a reliable appliance that lasts, saves you money with reusable filters, and allows you to brew without any real headache. If a coffee maker were a practical life partner, this might be it.

I have made a subreddit for my personal project/ experiment for spiritual practice and study.

I am looking now for qualified practitioners who are open minded and interested to join a 3 day FREE workshop/ program with the intention to elevate their own consciousness and understanding of life and thyself.

In Total I want to start this with 10 practitioners at once so I can manage and guide them easily throughout my day.

But as said, there are some qualifications/ basics needed.

1: You need to have at least for 3 times a day 30 minutes of absolute free, unplanned, quiet time (morning/midday/evening)

2: You should be able to breathe a specific way, so you should have a healthy and good lung

3: You must be disciplined and have the will follow my exact instructions for 3 days a row for maximum results.

4: You should be able throughout your day to manage that you did not eat a heavy or better no meal at least 1-2 hours before the 30 minute practice time I mentioned above.

5: Last one, should be selfreflected and conscious enough to recognize changes, even small trough these practices or at least by end of the three days.

I also recommend you if you are interested, to not drink coffee or alcohol, not smoke tabacco nor weed during the 3 days or taking substances that could bring you out of clarity.

So as you can see my intention really lies in helping people to higher consciousness and more spiritual understanding.

It's also helpful if you are someone with a spiritual base understanding and maybe you also practice even if not regular meditation before.

SO PLEASE BE HONEST TO YOURSELF IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW AND ALIGN WITH EVERY QUALIFICATION.

One the first hand, for the fairness to the people and on the second for the experiment itself.

So if you are interested and this resonates with you Please comment below this post: ‚Äû' want to participate""

I will take the first 5 People who comment.

Because I want to share this where else also to give the chance to a lot for people.

If the experiment be good I will do it again with more people to help elevate collective consciousness.

1me4ls5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1me4ls5/why_do_i_feel_blindsided/,Why do I feel blindsided?,"A man stopped me on the street last year. We had dinner, but I declined his invite to his place. I was still reeling from a heartbreak and about to leave town for work.

Three weeks ago, he stopped me again, not realizing we‚Äôd already met. He asked me out the next night. We had such a great time that I spent the night. He said he was in a phase of wanting to be with many women and had other dates lined up, so I assumed it was a one-off. I didn‚Äôt hear from him for two weeks.

Then he called out of the blue early this week. We had dinner. It was even better than the first time. Then we saw each other again. And again. Last night, we watched a movie at his place. This morning, we didn‚Äôt have sex, unusual for us, but I figured he was busy. We grabbed coffee and walked a block. Then he said, paraphrasing, that his gut says our path ends here.

I was stunned. He denied saying that he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, but I remembered it clearly. I wasn‚Äôt banking on a future, but after spending that much time together, it crossed my mind. I didn‚Äôt realize he actually wanted a future.

He reminded me of my dream of a little house and a garden near water. I admitted that I don‚Äôt always say I want a partner because it‚Äôs never guaranteed. He encouraged me to fully own that dream next time.

I told him this felt abrupt and unkind. He tried to lighten the moment with a joke, but I couldn‚Äôt laugh. I couldn‚Äôt even look at him.

He asked if I‚Äôd block him as I have blocked some men in my life. I said I didn‚Äôt know. He said there are only a few people who are truly right for us. I felt my heart put its walls back up.

He wants to stay friends. I said it‚Äôs too fresh to talk about it. He insisted. We hugged for a long time. I stayed on the bench after he left, just trying to hold myself together.

We recently received some money to help to get a better Nespresso machine and we are hesitant in which one to get. So far we have the smaller model with Original capsules, which is very nice as we aren't big coffee drinker, we drink just a bit.

However we are very tempted to get one of those better machine with nice milk foam thing to make cappuccino and so.

We are thinking maybe to get the ""Vertuo Creatista"", which looks great and apparently we can make a lot of different drinks (but mostly espresso and capuccino for us). And there is a discount currently of almost 200 euros. However the Vertuo capsules are a bit confusing as there is many different sizes, I kind of like that the Original ones are more simple (if I want a short, I press once, if I want extra, I just press 2 times), also the Vertuo capsules are more expensive than the Original ones, in the long run.

Then there is a very similar machine with Original Capsule but we don't get the discount on it ( the ""Creatista Plus Metal"".

And 3rd option, not a machine, but I saw they have a ""Barista machine"" which is just the thing to prepare the milk. Which is quite expensive for something only for the milk, but it is definitly cheaper than getting a new full machine.

Our days don‚Äôt have to be extravagant. A shared meal, a warm laugh, his arms pulling me closer as I unconsciously lean into his chest‚Äîthat‚Äôs all it takes. Time slows down when he‚Äôs near. Coffee tastes better, conversations flow softer, and even the air feels lighter. My heart rests when I‚Äôm with him. No pretense. Just peace.

But every parting feels like gravity hits harder.

There‚Äôs a quiet ache that lingers after we say goodbye. The kind that sits in my chest and doesn‚Äôt let go for a while. I try to be okay‚Äîgo about my day, distract myself, breathe‚Äîbut there's always a moment when I catch myself staring into space, retracing our last hug, our last shared glance, the sound of his laugh still echoing in my head.

And strangely, the more time we spend together, the heavier each goodbye becomes. I thought it would get easier... but it doesn't. Every new memory we create, every layer of comfort and closeness we build, adds more weight to the moments we have to let go. I find myself holding him tighter, lingering longer, as if my body knows the ache that‚Äôs coming once the door closes behind him.

It's not just missing him. It‚Äôs missing us‚Äîour simple, safe, soft little world. The comfort of knowing I‚Äôll fall asleep beside someone who knows my heart without needing me to explain it.

Still, I‚Äôll take the weight of missing him over the emptiness of never knowing what ‚Äúhome‚Äù in someone feels like.

Because he feels like home. Always has. And maybe that‚Äôs why goodbyes will always feel like leaving a part of myself behind.

I‚Äôve got a 2021 Explorer ST with just under 62k miles. Up until now, the transmission had always been buttery smooth. I decided to do a transmission fluid change as part of regular maintenance. After that, I noticed a weird sound, especially when giving it some spirited throttle (as we all love to do in this car!).

I brought it back to the dealership, and they found it was low on fluid. They topped it off, and the sound disappeared. However, soon after, I started experiencing a hard shift between 2nd and 3rd gear at low speeds. It‚Äôs harsh enough that if I had coffee in hand, I‚Äôd probably spill a bit.

Took it back again, and they said the first step Ford recommends is to reprogram the transmission control module. They cleared and reprogrammed it. Now they say it‚Äôs working fine, but advised me to drive it for a bit. If the issue comes back, the next steps would be a rebuild or replacement, both covered under warranty. But they also told me that the software reprogramming *isn‚Äôt* covered.

One such example: When someone calls us to unclog a garbage disposal in the middle of summer, we can practically guarantee they just had a cookout.¬†

Why? Because when we go to unclog the disposal, we almost always find the usual suspects hiding in the drain line:

**Things Not to Put Down Your Garbage Disposal This Summer**

* **Corn Husks and Silk:** The #1 summer disposal-clogger‚Ä¶yes, folks, it‚Äôs corn husks and silk! These things are made of *ludicrously* tough fibers, and they quickly get wrapped up in garbage disposal blades, where they‚Äôre incredibly annoying to untangle.
* **Corn Cobs:** In fact, just keep any part of corn other than kernels away from your disposal. A corn cob is basically like feeding a very small tree into your garbage disposal. The blades may be sharp, but they‚Äôre just not up to the task of chopping up something this tough.
* **Watermelon Rinds:** Similarly to corn cobs, watermelon rinds are way too hard for the average garbage disposal to deal with. They make great compost, though!
* **Oyster Shells:** Dump a handful of these suckers into your disposal and you‚Äôll realize your mistake just by the sound it makes when you turn it on. Oyster and mussel shells are even harder than vegetable rinds, and they‚Äôre definitely not making any pearls down there.
* **Bones:** This one isn't absolute ‚Äî a few little fish bones or something similar aren‚Äôt the end of the world ‚Äî but in general, bones are another item to avoid in the disposal. That huge plate of wing and rib bones? For your own sanity, don‚Äôt.¬†
* **Oil and Grease:** Right now, someone is dumping their grill‚Äôs drip pan full of burger grease into their garbage disposal, and we‚Äôre running after them in slow motion shouting ‚Äú*Noooooo*‚Äù like a 90s action hero. This stuff will clog the absolute daylights out of your disposal and your drains in general, so throw it in the trash instead!

Other big no-nos are coffee grounds, rice, eggshells, and fibrous veggies like broccoli. In fact, we‚Äôd go so far as to say ‚Äúwhen in doubt, take it out‚Äù ‚Äî garbage disposals are best suited for the little incidental bits that come from your dishes, and the trash can is a much better place for anything you need to dump.",1,1753974885.0,u_Roto-RooterOfficial,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend 22M says that I 24F am too sensitive and always upset. Since he is so nonchalant, he views my emotions in a negative light. He is constantly gaslighting me and shifts the blame on me for being upset. He always tells me that ‚ÄúI make myself mad‚Äù or he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm upset‚Äù after he‚Äôs done something. Here are a few examples. 

-almost missed our movie date from napping, I had to call a family member to wake him up. I was pissed because he is a daily napper and told him that he should have set an alarm. Told me that he doesn‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so mad. 

-Our love languages differ, mine is little things to make his day easier whether it be bringing him a coffee or a home cooked meal. He stays over often so I find myself washing his clothes, buying him snacks, etc. I simply stated that sometimes I‚Äôd like something from him to show his appreciation like a bouquet of flowers every once in a while (like any normal relationship) and he accused me of doing things for him just to gain something in return. I told him buying me dinner during the week doesn‚Äôt show anything because we switch off paying. 

-He does not listen to me and then switches the stories around to make it look like my fault. He gaslights me over literally everything and it‚Äôs beginning to get exhausting because it makes me look like I‚Äôm crazy. 

- Last week he said he‚Äôd be over by 8, but I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him so I figured he‚Äôd fallen asleep. I didn‚Äôt call him because I figured his body needed the rest that day. The next day he blamed me and said that I should have called him and so next time I need to make sure he‚Äôs awake. I said that he is a grown man and it is not my responsibility to wake him up. I said if you know you are laying down and have plans, be proactive and set an alarm. 


I‚Äôve had so many arguments over his behavior and how it makes me feel. He says sorry and then the cycle continues. He works a very tiring blue collar job and so I always try to make his long days easier but all I‚Äôve asked of him is to simply do above the bare minimum which I don‚Äôt even receive. I‚Äôm getting tired of my basic emotions getting invalidated.

Quit sugar just now cause something kept making me get hyper and in a weird mental state. (Sometimes paranoia, weird ideas, thinking there were hidden cameras, entities, ect).  
But I keep trying to find proof(?) that I possible just was either being micro dosed or somehow came into contact with illicit substances. (I've been at home most of the time, sometimes i get fast food and sweet tea but that doesnt seem to affect me negatively anymore. ) 

  
Quit the sugar we have in the pantry. Its probably fine but theres also tiny finer grains of sugar mixed in. (Came sugar so hopefully just dust from grinding it up. Its alot smaller and lighter)

Not feeling hyper right now, not overly fidgety, kinda just empty like i have depresson and maybe its just that. But I keep thinking there mightve been something in the sugar. Used to think something was wrong with the coffee but coffee made my mental health worse wether or not i got coffee from home.

Also.. had a weird experience once. 

Didn't eat much that morning, went to church... honestly was mildly paranoid about food i left at home being tampered with to begin with. But later in church I suddenly couldn't stop fidgeting. Moving my hands legs ect. Just couldn't be still. It was really concerning and laster maybe 30 min - 1 hour. Then I felt like my eye contact was off i felt like I just had even less ability to follow social cueues. Was fricking weird, after that I couldn't stop opening my eyes as wide as possible and kinda just walked around outside for a bit. Noticed my pupils were fairly constricted. Felt light headed and realized I was going to pass out. Found a secluded area, sat down, and i guess I fainted? Ended up vomiting a bunch and my eye contact was at 0. Genuinely felt like I had a bunch of autism symptoms in that regard. (Everything was brighter too.) 

even weirder part: A relative who was with me was full on board with taking me to see a neurologist. (Not the first time I've had like seizure symptoms. ) 

By the time I got home, rested, they were 100% against it. Like what changed? Then a month or so later they were open to me bringing it up to my doctor who told me it was actually no big deal and normal... 

Honestly that last part seems really damning like what changed? Why the sudden 180 flip and then flip back a long time after wards. 

  
Welp. Quitting sugar along with coffee now. I should've quit both a while ago but i just told myself I was probably just paranoid. I figured I just did something to cause me to faint the night before but I felt fine when I woke up.

¬† ‚ÄúOld news, Bronwyn,‚Äù says a voice over my shoulder. ‚ÄúWait till you see tomorrow‚Äôs post.‚Äù  
  
¬† Damn. I hate getting caught reading About That, especially by its creator. I lower my phone and slam my locker shut. ‚ÄúWhose lives are you ruining next, Simon?‚Äù  
  
¬† Simon falls into step beside me as I move against the flow of students heading for the exit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a public service,‚Äù he says with a dismissive wave. ‚ÄúYou tutor Reggie Crawley, don‚Äôt you? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather know he has a camera in his bedroom?‚Äù  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt bother answering. Me getting anywhere near the bedroom of perpetual stoner Reggie Crawley is about as likely as Simon growing a conscience.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnyway, they bring it on themselves. If people didn‚Äôt lie and cheat, I‚Äôd be out of business.‚Äù Simon‚Äôs cold blue eyes take in my lengthening strides. ‚ÄúWhere are you rushing off to? Covering yourself in extracurricular glory?‚Äù  
  
¬† I wish. As if to taunt me, an alert crosses my phone: Mathlete practice, 3 p.m., Epoch Coffee. Followed by a text from one of my teammates: Evan‚Äôs here.  
  
¬† Of course he is. The cute Mathlete‚Äîless of an oxymoron than you might think‚Äîseems to only ever show up when I can‚Äôt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù I say. As a general rule, and especially lately, I try to give Simon as little information as possible. We push through green metal doors to the back stairwell, a dividing line between the dinginess of the original Bayview High and its bright, airy new wing. Every year more wealthy families get priced out of San Diego and come fifteen miles east to Bayview, expecting that their tax dollars will buy them a nicer school experience than popcorn ceilings and scarred linoleum.  
  
¬† Simon‚Äôs still on my heels when I reach Mr. Avery‚Äôs lab on the third floor, and I half turn with my arms crossed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have someplace to be?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. Detention,‚Äù Simon says, and waits for me to keep walking. When I grasp the knob instead, he bursts out laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding me. You too? What‚Äôs your crime?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wrongfully accused,‚Äù I mutter, and yank the door open. Three other students are already seated, and I pause to take them in. Not the group I would have predicted. Except one.  
  
¬† Nate Macauley tips his chair back and smirks at me. ‚ÄúYou make a wrong turn? This is detention, not student council.‚Äù  
  
¬† He should know. Nate‚Äôs been in trouble since fifth grade, which is right around the time we last spoke. The gossip mill tells me he‚Äôs on probation with Bayview‚Äôs finest for‚Ä¶something. It might be a DUI; it might be drug dealing. He‚Äôs a notorious supplier, but my knowledge is purely theoretical.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSave the commentary.‚Äù Mr. Avery checks something off on a clipboard and closes the door behind Simon. High arched windows lining the back wall send triangles of afternoon sun splashing across the floor, and faint sounds of football practice float from the field behind the parking lot below.  
  
¬† I take a seat as Cooper Clay, who‚Äôs palming a crumpled piece of paper like a baseball, whispers ‚ÄúHeads up, Addy‚Äù and tosses it toward the girl across from him. Addy Prentiss blinks, smiles uncertainly, and lets the ball drop to the floor.  
  
¬† The classroom clock inches toward three, and I follow its progress with a helpless feeling of injustice. I shouldn‚Äôt even be here. I should be at Epoch Coffee, flirting awkwardly with Evan Neiman over differential equations.  
  
¬† Mr. Avery is a give-detention-first, ask-questions-never kind of guy, but maybe there‚Äôs still time to change his mind. I clear my throat and start to raise my hand until I notice Nate‚Äôs smirk broadening. ‚ÄúMr. Avery, that wasn‚Äôt my phone you found. I don‚Äôt know how it got into my bag. This is mine,‚Äù I say, brandishing my iPhone in its melon-striped case.  
  
¬† Honestly, you‚Äôd have to be clueless to bring a phone to Mr. Avery‚Äôs lab. He has a strict no-phone policy and spends the first ten minutes of every class rooting through backpacks like he‚Äôs head of airline security and we‚Äôre all on the watch list. My phone was in my locker, like always.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou too?‚Äù Addy turns to me so quickly, her blond shampoo-ad hair swirls around her shoulders. She must have been surgically removed from her boyfriend in order to show up alone. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt my phone either.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe three,‚Äù Cooper chimes in. His Southern accent makes it sound like thray. He and Addy exchange surprised looks, and I wonder how this is news to them when they‚Äôre part of the same clique. Maybe √ºberpopular peo  
ple have better things to talk about than unfair detentions.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomebody punked us!‚Äù Simon leans forward with his elbows on the desk, looking spring-loaded and ready to pounce on fresh gossip. His gaze darts over all four of us, clustered in the middle of the otherwise empty classroom, before settling on Nate. ‚ÄúWhy would anybody want to trap a bunch of students with mostly spotless records in detention? Seems like the sort of thing that, oh, I don‚Äôt know, a guy who‚Äôs here all the time might do for fun.‚Äù  
  
¬† I look at Nate, but can‚Äôt picture it. Rigging detention sounds like work, and everything about Nate‚Äîfrom his messy dark hair to his ratty leather jacket‚Äîscreams Can‚Äôt be bothered. Or yawns it, maybe. He meets my eyes but doesn‚Äôt say a word, just tips his chair back even farther. Another millimeter and he‚Äôll fall right over.  
  
¬† Cooper sits up straighter, a frown crossing his Captain America face. ‚ÄúHang on. I thought this was just a mix-up, but if the same thing happened to all of us, it‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs stupid idea of a prank. And I‚Äôm missing baseball practice because of it.‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs a heart surgeon being detained from a lifesaving operation.  
  
¬† Mr. Avery rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúSave the conspiracy theories for another teacher. I‚Äôm not buying it. You all know the rules against bringing phones to class, and you broke them.‚Äù He gives Simon an especially sour glance. Teachers know About That exists, but there‚Äôs not much they can do to stop it. Simon only uses initials to identify people and never talks openly about school. ‚ÄúNow listen up. You‚Äôre here until four. I want each of you to write a five-hundred-word essay on how technology is ruining American high schools. Anyone who can‚Äôt follow the rules gets another detention tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do we write with?‚Äù Addy asks. ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt any computers here.‚Äù Most classrooms have Chromebooks, but Mr. Avery, who looks like he should have retired a decade ago, is a holdout.  
  
¬† Mr. Avery crosses to Addy‚Äôs desk and taps the corner of a lined yellow notepad. We all have one. ‚ÄúExplore the magic of longhand writing. It‚Äôs a lost art.‚Äù  
  
¬† Addy‚Äôs pretty, heart-shaped face is a mask of confusion. ‚ÄúBut how do we know when we‚Äôve reached five hundred words?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCount,‚Äù Mr. Avery replies. His eyes drop to the phone I‚Äôm still holding. ‚ÄúAnd hand that over, Miss Rojas.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt the fact that you‚Äôre confiscating my phone twice give you pause? Who has two phones?‚Äù I ask. Nate grins, so quick I almost miss it. ‚ÄúSeriously, Mr. Avery, somebody was playing a joke on us.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Avery‚Äôs snowy mustache twitches in annoyance, and he extends his hand with a beckoning motion. ‚ÄúPhone, Miss Rojas. Unless you want a return visit.‚Äù I give it over with a sigh as he looks disapprovingly at the others. ‚ÄúThe phones I took from the rest of you earlier are in my desk. You‚Äôll get them back after detention.‚Äù Addy and Cooper exchange amused glances, probably because their actual phones are safe in their backpacks.  
  
¬† Mr. Avery tosses my phone into a drawer and sits behind the teacher‚Äôs desk, opening a book as he prepares to ignore us for the next hour. I pull out a pen, tap it against my yellow notepad, and contemplate the assignment. Does Mr. Avery really believe technology is ruining schools? That‚Äôs a pretty sweeping statement to make over a few contraband phones. Maybe it‚Äôs a trap and he‚Äôs looking for us to contradict him instead of agree.  
  
¬† I glance at Nate, who‚Äôs bent over his notepad writing computers suck over and over in block letters.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm overthinking this.  
  
¬† Cooper  
  
¬† Monday, September 24, 3:05 p.m.  
  
¬† My hand hurts within minutes. It‚Äôs pathetic, I guess, but I can‚Äôt remember the last time I wrote anything longhand. Plus I‚Äôm using my right hand, which never feels natural no matter how many years I‚Äôve done it. My father insisted I learn to write right-handed in second grade after he first saw me pitch. Your left arm‚Äôs gold, he told me. Don‚Äôt waste it on crap that don‚Äôt matter. Which is anything but pitching as far as he‚Äôs concerned.  
  
¬† That was when he started calling me Cooperstown, like the baseball hall of fame. Nothing like putting a little pressure on an eight-year-old.  
  
¬† Simon reaches for his backpack and roots around, unzipping every section. He hoists it onto his lap and peers inside. ‚ÄúWhere the hell‚Äôs my water bottle?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo talking, Mr. Kelleher,‚Äù Mr. Avery says without looking up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, but‚Äîmy water bottle‚Äôs missing. And I‚Äôm thirsty.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Avery points toward the sink at the back of the room, its counter crowded with beakers and petri dishes. ‚ÄúGet yourself a drink. Quietly.‚Äù  
  
¬† Simon gets up and grabs a cup from a stack on the counter, filling it with water from the tap. He heads back to his seat and puts the cup on his desk, but seems distracted by Nate‚Äôs methodical writing. ‚ÄúDude,‚Äù he says, kicking his sneaker against the leg of Nate‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúSeriously. Did you put those phones in our backpacks to mess with us?‚Äù  
  
¬† Now Mr. Avery looks up, frowning. ‚ÄúI said quietly, Mr. Kelleher.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nate leans back and crosses his arms. ‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù  
  
¬† Simon shrugs. ‚ÄúWhy do you do anything? So you‚Äôll have company for whatever your screw-up of the day was?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne more word out of either of you and it‚Äôs detention tomorrow,‚Äù Mr. Avery warns.  
  
¬† Simon opens his mouth anyway, but before he can speak there‚Äôs the sound of tires squealing and then the crash of two cars hitting each other. Addy gasps and I brace myself against my desk like somebody just rear-ended me. Nate, who looks glad for the interruption, is the first on his feet toward the window. ‚ÄúWho gets into a fender bender in the school parking lot?‚Äù he asks.  
  
¬† Bronwyn looks at Mr. Avery like she‚Äôs asking for permission, and when he gets up from his desk she heads for the window as well. Addy follows her, and I finally unfold myself from my seat. Might as well see what‚Äôs going on. I lean against the ledge to look outside, and Simon comes up beside me with a disparaging laugh as he surveys the scene below.  
  
¬† Two cars, an old red one and a nondescript gray one, are smashed into each other at a right angle. We all stare at them in silence until Mr. Avery lets out an exasperated sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd better make sure no one was hurt.‚Äù He runs his eyes over all of us and zeroes in on Bronwyn as the most responsible of the bunch. ‚ÄúMiss Rojas, keep this room contained until I get back.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Bronwyn says, casting a nervous glance toward Nate. We stay at the window, watching the scene below, but before Mr. Avery or another teacher appears outside, both cars start their engines and drive out of the parking lot.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, that was anticlimactic,‚Äù Simon says. He heads back to his desk and picks up his cup, but instead of sitting he wanders to the front of the room and scans the periodic table of elements poster. He leans out into the hallway like he‚Äôs about to leave, but then he turns and raises his cup like he‚Äôs toasting us. ‚ÄúAnyone else want some water?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Addy says, slipping into her chair.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet it yourself, princess.‚Äù Simon smirks. Addy rolls her eyes and stays put while Simon leans against Mr. Avery‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúLiterally, huh? What‚Äôll you do with yourself now that homecoming‚Äôs over? Big gap between now and senior prom.‚Äù  
  
¬† Addy looks at me without answering. I don‚Äôt blame her. Simon‚Äôs train of thought almost never goes anywhere good when it comes to our friends. He acts like he‚Äôs above caring whether he‚Äôs popular, but he was pretty smug when he wound up on the junior prom court last spring. I‚Äôm still not sure how he pulled that off, unless he traded keeping secrets for votes.  
  
¬† Simon was nowhere to be found on homecoming court last week, though. I was voted king, so maybe I‚Äôm next on his list to harass, or whatever the hell he‚Äôs doing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your point, Simon?‚Äù I ask, taking a seat next to Addy. Addy and I aren‚Äôt close, exactly, but I kind of feel protective of her. She‚Äôs been dating my best friend since freshman year, and she‚Äôs a sweet girl. Also not the kind of person who knows how to stand up to a guy like Simon who just won‚Äôt quit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a princess  
and you‚Äôre a jock,‚Äù he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn, then at Nate. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre a brain. And you‚Äôre a criminal. You‚Äôre all walking teen-movie stereotypes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù Bronwyn asks. She‚Äôs been hovering near the window, but now goes to her desk and perches on top of it. She crosses her legs and pulls her dark ponytail over one shoulder. Something about her is cuter this year. New glasses, maybe? Longer hair? All of a sudden, she‚Äôs kind of working this sexy-nerd thing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the omniscient narrator,‚Äù Simon says.  
  
¬† Bronwyn‚Äôs brows rise above her black frames. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing in teen movies.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, but Bronwyn.‚Äù Simon winks and chugs his water in one long gulp. ‚ÄúThere is such a thing in life.‚Äù  
  
¬† He says it like a threat, and I wonder if he‚Äôs got something on Bronwyn for that stupid app of his. I hate that thing. Almost all my friends have been on it at one point or another, and sometimes it causes real problems. My buddy Luis and his girlfriend broke up because of something Simon wrote. Though it was a true story about Luis hooking up with his girlfriend‚Äôs cousin. But still. That stuff doesn‚Äôt have to be published. Hallway gossip is bad enough.  
  
¬† And if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm pretty freaked at what Simon could write about me if he put his mind to it.  
  
¬† Simon holds his cup up, grimacing. ‚ÄúThis tastes like crap.‚Äù He drops the cup, and I roll my eyes at his attempt at drama. Even when he falls to the floor, I still think he‚Äôs messing around. But then the wheezing starts.  
  
¬† Bronwyn‚Äôs on her feet first, then kneeling beside him. ‚ÄúSimon,‚Äù she says, shaking his shoulder. ‚ÄúAre you okay? What happened? Can you talk?‚Äù Her voice goes from concerned to panicky, and that‚Äôs enough to get me moving. But Nate‚Äôs faster, shoving past me and crouching next to Bronwyn.  
  
¬†A pen,‚Äù he says, his eyes scanning Simon‚Äôs brick-red face. ‚ÄúYou have a pen?‚Äù Simon nods wildly, his hand clawing at his throat. I grab the pen off my desk and try to hand it to Nate, thinking he‚Äôs about to do an emergency tracheotomy or something. Nate just stares at me like I have two heads. ‚ÄúAn epinephrine pen,‚Äù he says, searching for Simon‚Äôs backpack. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs having an allergic reaction.‚Äù  
  
¬† Addy stands and wraps her arms around her body, not saying a word. Bronwyn turns to me, face flushed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find a teacher and call nine-one-one. Stay with him, okay?‚Äù She grabs her phone out of Mr. Avery‚Äôs drawer and runs into the hallway.  
  
¬† I kneel next to Simon. His eyes are bugging out of his head, his lips are blue, and he‚Äôs making horrible choking noises. Nate dumps the entire contents of Simon‚Äôs backpack on the floor and scrabbles through the mess of books, papers, and clothes. ‚ÄúSimon, where do you keep it?‚Äù he asks, tearing open the small front compartment and yanking out two regular pens and a set of keys.  
  
¬† Simon‚Äôs way past talking, though. I put one sweaty palm on his shoulder, like that‚Äôll do any good. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay, you‚Äôre gonna be okay. We‚Äôre gettin‚Äô help.‚Äù I can hear my voice slowing, thickening like molasses. My accent always comes out hard when I‚Äôm stressed. I turn to Nate and ask, ‚ÄúYou sure he‚Äôs not chokin‚Äô on somethin‚Äô?‚Äù Maybe he needs the Heimlich maneuver, not a freaking medical pen.  
  
¬† Nate ignores me, tossing Simon‚Äôs empty backpack aside. ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù he yells, slamming a fist on the floor. ‚ÄúDo you keep it on you, Simon? Simon!‚Äù Simon‚Äôs eyes roll back in his head as Nate digs around in Simon‚Äôs pockets. But he doesn‚Äôt find anything except a wrinkled Kleenex.  
  
¬† Sirens blare in the distance as Mr. Avery and two other teachers race in with Bronwyn trailing behind them on her phone. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt find his EpiPen,‚Äù Nate says tersely, gesturing to the pile of Simon‚Äôs things.  
  
¬† Mr. Avery stares at Simon in slack-jawed horror for a second, then turns to me. ‚ÄúCooper, the nurse‚Äôs office has EpiPens. They should be labeled in plain sight. Hurry!‚Äù  
  
¬† I run into the hallway, hearing footsteps behind me that fade as I quickly reach the back stairwell and yank the door open. I take the stairs three at a time until I‚Äôm on the first floor, and weave through a few straggling students until I get to the nurse‚Äôs office. The door‚Äôs ajar, but nobody‚Äôs there.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs a cramped little space with the exam table up against the windows and a big gray storage cabinet looming to my left. I scan the room, my eyes landing on two wall-mounted white boxes with red block lettering. One reads EMERGENCY DEFIBRILLATOR, the other EMERGENCY EPINEPHRINE. I fumble at the latch on the second one and pull it open.  
  
¬† There‚Äôs nothing inside.  
  
¬† I open the other box, which has a plastic device with a picture of a heart. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not it, so I start rummaging through the gray storage cabinet, pulling out boxes of bandages and aspirin. I don‚Äôt see anything that looks like a pen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCooper, did you find them?‚Äù Ms. Grayson, one of the teachers who‚Äôd entered the lab with Mr. Avery and Bronwyn, barrels into the room. She‚Äôs panting hard and clutching her side.  
  
¬† I gesture toward the empty wall-mounted box. ‚ÄúThey should be there, right? But they‚Äôre not.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCheck the supply cabinet,‚Äù Ms. Grayson says, ignoring the Band-Aid boxes scattered across the floor that prove I‚Äôve already tried. Another teacher joins us, and we tear the office apart as the sound of sirens gets closer. When we‚Äôve opened the last cabinet, Ms. Grayson wipes a trickle of sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. ‚ÄúCooper, let Mr. Avery know we haven‚Äôt found anything yet. Mr. Contos and I will keep looking.‚Äù  
  
¬† I get to Mr. Avery‚Äôs lab the same time the paramedics do. There are three of them in navy uniforms, two pushing a long white stretcher, one racing ahead to clear the small crowd that‚Äôs gathered around the door. I wait until they‚Äôre all inside and slip in behind them. Mr. Avery‚Äôs slumped next to the chalkboard, his yellow dress shirt untucked. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt find the pens,‚Äù I tell him.  
  
¬† He runs a shaking hand through his thin white hair as one of the paramedics stabs Simon with a syringe and the other two lift him onto the stretcher. ‚ÄúGod help that boy,‚Äù he whispers. More to himself than to me, I think.  
  
¬† Addy‚Äôs standing off to the side by herself, tears rolling down her cheeks. I cross over to her and put an arm around her shoulders as the paramedics maneuver Simon‚Äôs stretcher into the hallway. ‚ÄúCan you come along?‚Äù one asks Mr. Avery. He nods and follows, leaving the room empty except for a few shell-shocked teachers and the four of us who started detention with Simon.  
  
¬† Barely fifteen minutes ago, by my guess, but it feels like hours.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs he okay now?‚Äù Addy asks in a strangled voice. Bronwyn clasps her phone between her palms like she‚Äôs using it to pray. Nate stands with his hands on his hips, staring at the door as more teachers and students start trickling inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say no,‚Äù he says.  
  
¬† Addy  
  
¬† Monday, September 24, 3:25 p.m.  
  
¬† Bronwyn, Nate, and Cooper are all talking to the teachers, but I can‚Äôt. I need Jake. I pull my phone out of my bag to text him but my hands are shaking too bad. So I call instead.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBaby?‚Äù He picks up on the second ring, sounding surprised. We‚Äôre not big callers. None of our friends are. Sometimes when I‚Äôm with Jake and his phone rings, he holds it up and jokes, ‚ÄúWhat does ‚Äòincoming call‚Äô mean?‚Äù It‚Äôs usually his mom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJake‚Äù is all I can get out before I start bawling. Cooper‚Äôs arm is still around my shoulders, and it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me up. I‚Äôm crying too hard to talk, and Cooper takes the phone from me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, man. ‚ÄôS Cooper,‚Äù he says, his accent thicker than normal. ‚ÄúWhere you at?‚Äù He listens for a few seconds. ‚ÄúCan you meet us outside? There‚Äôs been‚Ä¶Somethin‚Äô happened. Addy‚Äôs real upset. Naw, she‚Äôs fine, but‚Ä¶Simon Kelleher got hurt bad in detention. Ambulance took him an‚Äô we dunno if he‚Äôs gon‚Äô be okay.‚Äù Cooper‚Äôs words melt into one another like ice cream, and I can hardly understand him.  
  
¬† Bronwyn turns to the closest teacher, Ms. Grayson. ‚ÄúShould we stay? Do you need us?‚Äù  
  
¬† Ms. Grayson‚Äôs hands flutter around her throat. ‚ÄúGoodness, I don‚Äôt suppose so. You told the paramedics everything? Simon‚Ä¶took a drink of water and collapsed?‚Äù Bronwyn and Cooper both nod. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so strange. He has a peanut allergy, of course, but‚Ä¶you‚Äôre sure he didn‚Äôt eat anything?‚Äù  
  
¬† Cooper gives me my phone and runs a hand through his neatly cropped sandy hair. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. He just drank a cup of water an‚Äô fell over.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe it was something he had with lunch,‚Äù Ms. Grayson says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible he had a delayed reaction.‚Äù She looks around the room, her eyes settling on Simon‚Äôs discarded cup on the floor. ‚ÄúI suppose we should put this aside,‚Äù she says, brushing past Bronwyn to pick it up. ‚ÄúSomebody might want to look at it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want to go,‚Äù I burst out, swiping at the tears on my cheeks. I can‚Äôt stand being in this room another second.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay if I help her?‚Äù Cooper asks, and Ms. Grayson nods. ‚ÄúShould I come back?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs all right, Cooper. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll call you if they need you. Go home and try to get back to normal. Simon‚Äôs in good hands now.‚Äù She leans in a little closer, her tone softening. ‚ÄúI am so sorry. That must have been awful.‚Äù  
  
¬† She‚Äôs mostly looking at Cooper, though. There‚Äôs not a female teacher at Bayview who can resist his all-American charm.  
  
¬† Cooper keeps an arm around me on the way out. It‚Äôs nice. I don‚Äôt have brothers, but if I did, I imagine this is how they‚Äôd prop you up when you felt sick. Jake wouldn‚Äôt like most of his friends being this close to me, but Cooper‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs a gentleman. I lean into him as we pass posters for last week‚Äôs homecoming dance that haven‚Äôt been taken down yet. Cooper pushes the front door open, and there, thank God, is Jake.  
  
¬† I collapse into his arms, and for a second, everything‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll never forget seeing Jake for t  
he first time, freshman year: he had a mouth full of braces and hadn‚Äôt gotten tall or broad-shouldered yet, but I took one look at his dimples and summer sky‚Äìblue eyes and knew. He was the one for me. It‚Äôs just a bonus he turned out beautiful.  
  
¬† He strokes my hair while Cooper explains in a low voice what happened. ‚ÄúGod, Ads,‚Äù Jake says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awful. Let‚Äôs get you home.‚Äù  
  
¬† Cooper leaves on his own, and I‚Äôm suddenly sorry I didn‚Äôt do more for him. I can tell by his voice he‚Äôs as freaked out as I am, just hiding it better. But Cooper‚Äôs so golden, he can handle anything. His girlfriend, Keely, is one of my best friends, and the kind of girl who does everything right. She‚Äôll know exactly how to help. Way better than me.  
  
¬† I settle myself into Jake‚Äôs car and watch the town blur past as he drives a little too fast. I live only a mile from school, and the drive is short, but I‚Äôm bracing myself for my mother‚Äôs reaction because I‚Äôm positive she‚Äôll have heard. Her communication channels are mysterious but foolproof, and sure enough she‚Äôs standing on our front porch as Jake pulls into the driveway. I can read her mood even though the Botox froze her expressions long ago.",1,1753974726.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1me4792,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1me4792/how_does_the_pyle_pdwr53btbk_compare_among_home/,How does the Pyle PDWR53BTBK Compare Among Home Theater Systems?,"Testing the Pyle PDWR53BTBK has been quite an engaging experience. I've been dabbling with various speaker systems over the years, and I wasn‚Äôt initially sure how this Bluetooth-enabled wall-mounted system would hold up. After spending several weeks putting it through its paces in my garage and living room, I‚Äôve gathered a few insights to share with anyone considering this product.

**Ease of Installation and Design Aesthetics**  
The first thing that struck me was the design. It‚Äôs sleek yet sturdy, with a rugged black cabinet finishing that somehow blends well in different interior spaces. Mounting the speakers was relatively easy, thanks to the adjustable-angle brackets. I had it up on the wall in my garage in under 30 minutes using standard tools. The rust-proof metal grills are a nice touch, especially since I planned to use the speakers in environments with occasional moisture. This attention to detail makes it feel durable and thoughtfully constructed.

**Audio Performance**  
You can‚Äôt talk about the Pyle PDWR53BTBK without mentioning the sound quality. With a 300-watt output, the speakers deliver a robust and full-bodied audio experience. The 5.25-inch polymer subwoofers and 0.5-inch Mylar dome tweeters work together to deliver clear mids and punchy bass. I played everything from rock classics to audiobooks during my ‚Äútesting sessions‚Äù (which basically consisted of hanging out and enjoying coffee while the soundtracks of my youth boomed in the background), and it consistently impressed me. The surround sound felt immersive without drowning out the finer details.

**Key Benefits**  
- Strong, adjustable bass and treble controls on the rear panel.  
- Versatility in audio input options, including Bluetooth, RCA, and 3.5mm AUX connections.  
- Compact yet impactful design suitable for various types of rooms.  

[Check Pyle PDWR53BTBK price on Amazon.](https://cavenyc.com/p/b082b6zp16/)

**Bluetooth Connectivity**  
The built-in Bluetooth (version 4.2) was probably the feature I used the most. Pairing it with my phone, tablet, or laptop was smooth and hassle-free. The range of over 33 feet worked well for my purposes. I managed to control the playlist from another corner of my house without the music ever skipping. It‚Äôs ideal for casual gatherings or background music in the studio.

**Rear Panel Features and Controls**  
The control options on the back of the active speaker offer ample flexibility. There‚Äôs a rotary volume knob alongside bass and treble adjustments, which allow you to customize the sound to suit your preferences. Whether I wanted powerful bass-heavy beats or crisp dialogue from a podcast, tweaking took minimal effort. That said, the lack of an included remote felt slightly inconvenient at times.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Power cable length could have been longer for easier placement.  
- Remote control was missing; having to rely solely on the back panel can be a minor hassle for some users.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similar models from brands like Yamaha or Bose, this system finds itself in an interesting middle ground. While it might lack the superior finesse and overall prestige associated with those brands, it delivers impressively for its price. For example, the Bose 251 wall-mount speakers offer pristine sound but at a significantly higher cost. However, Yamaha‚Äôs NS-AW150BL comes close in terms of affordability yet doesn't provide similar bass performance or as versatile input options. The Pyle unit stands out as a budget-friendly option that doesn‚Äôt compromise on impactful sound delivery.

**Smart Spending**  
If we‚Äôre evaluating the Pyle PDWR53BTBK on a price-to-performance basis, it delivers more than expected. It‚Äôs difficult to overlook the Bluetooth functionality, stereo pairing, and solid construction at its current price point. Larger, more premium systems might boast extra features, but this one doesn‚Äôt skimp on the essentials. For anyone on a budget or those looking to upgrade from standard portable wireless speakers, this offers excellent bang for the buck.

1me42m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1me42m8/simple_perfection_by_abbi_glines/,Simple Perfection by Abbi Glines:,"My mother hadn‚Äôt spoken to me during my father‚Äôs funeral. I had gone to comfort her but she turned from me and walked away. There were a lot of things I expected in life, but that hadn‚Äôt been one of them. Ever. Nothing that I‚Äôd done had affected my mother‚Äôs life. However, she‚Äôd helped my father as he had tried to destroy mine.  
  
¬† Seeing him lying there cold and still in the casket hadn‚Äôt struck me the way I imagined. Everything was too fresh. I hadn‚Äôt had time to forgive him. He had hurt Della. I could never forgive that. Even with him dead and buried in the ground I couldn‚Äôt forgive what he‚Äôd done to her. She was the center of my world.  
  
¬† My mother had been able to see the lack of emotion in my eyes. I wasn‚Äôt one for pretending. At least not anymore. A week ago I had walked away from this life I‚Äôd been born into without one ounce of remorse. It hadn‚Äôt been hard to let it all go. My focus had been on finding Della. The woman who had walked into my life and changed everything. Della Sloane had become my addiction when I hadn‚Äôt been available. In all her twisted perfection she had made me fall helplessly in love with her. A life without her in it seemed pointless. I often wondered how people found joy in life without knowing her.  
  
¬† With the sudden death of my father, the life I had just washed my hands of and been so ready to walk away from was now being placed completely on my shoulders. Della had stood beside me quietly from the moment I‚Äôd stepped foot back in Rosemary Beach, Florida. Her small hand tucked into mine, she knew when I needed her without my saying anything. A squeeze from her hand would remind me that she was there beside me and I could do this.  
  
¬† Except at this moment she wasn‚Äôt with me. She was at my house. I hadn‚Äôt wanted to bring her here, to my mother‚Äôs house. My mother might have wanted to pretend that I didn‚Äôt exist but I now owned everything in her life, including the house she lived in. It came with the country club, and my grandfather had made sure that when my father passed away this would all become mine.  
  
¬† Not once had my father thought this might be something I needed to know. He held it over my head that he controlled my life. If I wanted this world, then I had to bend to his will. Yet all along it would become mine on my twenty-fifth birthday or in the event of my father‚Äôs death. Whichever came first. There was no running from this now.  
  
¬† I thought about knocking and changed my mind. My mother needed to stop acting like a child. I was all she had left. It was time she accepted Della in my life, because I was getting a ring on her finger as soon as I could convince her of it. I knew Della well enough to know that it wouldn‚Äôt be easy to get her to marry me. With my world completely morphing into something I hadn‚Äôt expected, I wanted the security of knowing that when I came home Della would be there.  
  
¬† I started to reach for the doorknob when the door swung open. My eyes lifted to see Angelina Greystone standing in the doorway of my parents‚Äô house with an innocent smile on her face. The evil twinkle in her eye couldn‚Äôt be masked by her attempt to appear nice. I had almost married this woman so that I could get the club that was going to become mine anyway. My father had made me believe I had to marry Angelina to get the promotion and future I deserved.  
  
¬† What my dad hadn‚Äôt banked on was Della walking into my life and showing me there was more for me than a loveless marriage to a heartless bitch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe were expecting you. Your mother is in the sitting room with some chamomile tea I made for her. She needs to see you, Woods. I‚Äôm glad you took her feelings into consideration and didn‚Äôt bring that girl.‚Äù  
  
¬† The one thing I did know, despite what the witch had just said, was she knew Della‚Äôs name. She might have wanted to pretend like she had never heard of her and didn‚Äôt know her, but she did. She was just being spiteful. What I didn‚Äôt know was why the fuck she was at my mother‚Äôs house.  
  
¬† I pushed past her and walked into the house without responding to her. I knew where my mother was without her help. The sitting room was the place my mother always went to be alone. She would sit on the white velvet chaise lounge that had once been my grandmother‚Äôs and she would stare out at the water through the large picture windows that lined the room.  
  
¬† I ignored the click of Angelina‚Äôs heels as she followed behind me. Everything about her grated on my nerves. Her being here in the middle of a family situation on the day of my father‚Äôs funeral only added to my disgust. Why was she doing this? What did she think this would win her? I owned it all now. Me. Not my father. And certainly not my mother. I was now the Kerrington in control.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMother,‚Äù I said as I walked into the sitting room without knocking. She didn‚Äôt need a chance to send me away. Not that I would go without having this conversation. As wrong as she had been, I loved her. She was my mom, even though she had always stood beside my father and never once thought of me. It had always been about what they wanted for me. But it didn‚Äôt make me love her less.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt turn her attention from the gulf view outside. ‚ÄúWoods, I was expecting you.‚Äù Nothing more. It hurt. We had both lost a part of our lives with my father‚Äôs death. She didn‚Äôt see it that way. She never would.  
  
¬† I walked  
over to stand in her line of view. ‚ÄúWe need to talk,‚Äù I replied simply.  
  
¬† She shifted her eyes to look up at me. ‚ÄúYes, we do.‚Äù  
  
¬† I could have let her control this conversation but I wasn‚Äôt going to. It was time I set some boundaries. Especially now that I had Della with me and we were back in Rosemary.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt least he came alone.‚Äù Angelina‚Äôs voice came from the door and I jerked my head to glare at her intrusion. She wasn‚Äôt a part of this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt concern you. You may leave,‚Äù I replied in a cold tone.  
  
¬† She flinched.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe is a part of this. She‚Äôs going to stay with me. I need someone here so I‚Äôm not alone and Angelina understands that. She‚Äôs a good girl. She would have made an excellent daughter-in-law.‚Äù  
  
¬† I understood my mother‚Äôs pain at losing my father was fresh‚Äîand she was in pain. But I wouldn‚Äôt let her control this. It was time I made some things very clear for both of them. ‚ÄúShe would have been a selfish spoiled bitch of a daughter-in-law. I was lucky enough to realize it before it was too late and I ruined my life.‚Äù I heard both of their sharp intakes of breath but I wasn‚Äôt about to let them speak. ‚ÄúI control everything now, Mother. I will take care of you. I will make sure you want for nothing. However, I will not accept or acknowledge Angelina in my life. More importantly, I will not allow anyone to hurt Della. I will protect her from both of you. She is my perfection. She holds my heart in her hands. When she hurts it brings me to my knees. There is no way to explain to you the way I feel about her. Just understand that I will not allow anyone to hurt her again. I won‚Äôt forgive that. I lose a piece of my soul when I see her in pain.‚Äù  
  
¬† The tight line of my mother‚Äôs mouth was the only answer I needed. She wasn‚Äôt accepting this. Today wasn‚Äôt the day to try to convince her about my feelings for Della. She was mourning and I was still angry with the man she was mourning. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, call me. When you‚Äôre ready to talk to me without resentment toward Della, then call me. We will talk. You‚Äôre my mother and I love you. But I won‚Äôt let you near Della, nor will I put you before her. Understand that if you make me choose, I will choose her without a second thought.‚Äù  
  
¬† I walked over and placed a kiss on the top of my mother‚Äôs head before walking past Angelina without a word. It was time I got back home. Della didn‚Äôt do well alone. I was always anxious when I left her.  
  
¬† Della  
  
¬† He still hadn‚Äôt cried. No emotion at all. I hated that. I wanted him to grieve. He needed to let it out instead of bottling his emotions because of me. The idea that he was hardened toward his pain because he was protecting me twisted my gut. His father had betrayed him by sending me away. But I had seen the look in Woods‚Äôs eyes as he looked at his father, seeking approval. He had loved his father. He needed to mourn his loss.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDella?‚Äù I turned to see Woods walk into the living room. His eyes scanned the room before they found me standing outside on the balcony. He immediately headed for the door. There was a determination in his eyes that worried me. He opened the door and stepped outside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, did things go okay?‚Äù I asked before he pulled me into his arms and held me tightly against him. He had done this a lot over the past week.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs grieving. We will talk again once she‚Äôs had time to process everything,‚Äù he said into my hair. ‚ÄúI missed you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled sadly and pulled back so I could look up at him. ‚ÄúYou were gone for about an hour. Not much time to miss me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods ran his hand through my hair, brushing it out of the way, and then cupped my face. ‚ÄúI missed you the second I walked out that door. I want you with me all the time.‚Äù  
  
¬† Smiling, I turned my head and kissed his hand. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt always be with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods‚Äôs eyes darkened with something I recognized well. ‚ÄúBut I want you with me.‚Äù He slipped one of his hands around my waist, tugging me up against him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt concentrate when I‚Äôm not close enough to touch you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I grinned as I pressed a kiss to the inside of his wrist. ‚ÄúWhen you touch me we tend to get carried away.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods‚Äôs hand slipped under my shirt and I shivered as he moved it closer to my chest. ‚ÄúRight now I want to get carried away.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted that too. I always wanted that, but he needed to talk. He needed to say something.  
  
¬† His phone rang, interrupting both of us.  
  
¬† His face tensed and he let his hand slide out from underneath my shirt reluctantly before reaching into his pocket to pull out his phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said in his business tone. He looked at me apologetically. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll be there in five minutes. Tell him to meet me in my dad‚Äôs . . . in my office.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was having a hard time calling his dad‚Äôs office ‚Äúhis.‚Äù That was only another glimpse into the pain he was ignoring.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was Vince. There are several board members in town and they want to meet with me in an hour. Gary, my dad‚Äôs adviser and best friend, wants to brief me first. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said, reaching out to take my hand and pull me against him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sorry. There is nothing to be sorry about. If there‚Äôs anything I can do to help you, then I will. Just tell me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods chuckled. ‚ÄúIf I could get away with keeping you in my office all day with me, then I would.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHmmm . . . I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get a lot of work done.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know I wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo, show that board that you‚Äôre ready for this.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods pressed a kiss to my head. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted to work again. I missed seeing everyone and having something to do. Lying on the beach every day wasn‚Äôt really me. ‚ÄúCould I have my job back?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† A frown wrinkled Woods‚Äôs brow. ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt want you working in the dining room.‚Äù  
  
¬† I had been prepared for this. ‚ÄúOkay. Then I‚Äôm going to go find a job somewhere else. I need something to do. Especially with you being so busy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat if you need me? Where would you want to work? What if I can‚Äôt get to you? That won‚Äôt work, Della. I can‚Äôt protect you if you aren‚Äôt near me.‚Äù I was only adding more stress for him. He needed more time to adjust. I would give him that. He needed to heal. I would have to find a way to spend my days.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. We‚Äôll wait a couple weeks and talk about it again,‚Äù I said with a smile, hoping to reassure him.  
  
¬† He looked relieved. That was what I had wanted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you once this meeting is over. We‚Äôll have dinner together. I won‚Äôt leave you here alone long. I swear.‚Äù  
  
¬† I just nodded.  
  
¬† Woods pulled me to him and kissed me. It was a possessive kiss. Right now he needed me to be there for him. For now, that is what I would do. Be there for him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he whispered against my lips, and then pressed one last kiss to them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Woods left and I stayed outside on the balcony looking out at the gulf. I had missed out on life for so long and now I was learning that life was about sacrifice. Especially when you loved someone.  
  
¬† My phone rang this time and I picked it up from the table I‚Äôd left it on earlier. It was an unknown number. That meant one thing: it was Tripp.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, sitting down on the lounge chair beside me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow are things?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. Woods is adjusting,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† Tripp let out a weary sigh. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve come home for the funeral. I just . . . I couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt know what it was in Rosemary that haunted Tripp. But I knew that something did. Since he‚Äôd left he had called me twice. Both times it had been from an unknown number and both times he had seemed off. Almost depressed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJace said he tried to get in contact with you and couldn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve changed your number.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. I did. I needed some space.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJace misses you. He worries about you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tripp didn‚Äôt respond and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was the person who should push him to resp  
ond.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call him. Let him know there‚Äôs no reason to worry. I shouldn‚Äôt have stayed in Rosemary so long. It messes with my head. I can‚Äôt go back there. There‚Äôre things . . . stuff I don‚Äôt like to face.‚Äù  
  
¬† I already knew this. I had no idea what those things were but I knew that they haunted him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you working again?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. Woods doesn‚Äôt want me working right now. He needs me to be available for him. I‚Äôm his only source of support. His mother . . . well . . . you know how she is.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tripp paused a moment and I wondered what he was thinking about. I really didn‚Äôt want him to say something negative about Woods. ‚ÄúRight now he needs you. I get it. But, Della, you started this journey to live life. Don‚Äôt forget that. You left one prison; don‚Äôt find yourself in another.‚Äù  
  
¬† His words sliced through me painfully. Woods was nothing like my mother. He needed me right now because he had lost his father and been thrown into a position he wasn‚Äôt prepared for overnight. He wasn‚Äôt trying to control me. ‚ÄúThis is different. I‚Äôm choosing to stand beside Woods. I love him and I will be here for whatever he needs. Once he‚Äôs better he‚Äôll be fine with me getting a job again.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tripp didn‚Äôt respond and we sat there for a few minutes in silence. I wondered if he disagreed or if he wasn‚Äôt sure what to say to that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe next time I call I won‚Äôt block my number. I want you to have it if you need it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wouldn‚Äôt need his number.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust . . . don‚Äôt give it to Jace or anyone. Please.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood-bye, Tripp,‚Äù I replied before ending the call. I didn‚Äôt want to hear his doubt and concern. He was wrong. Everything was going to be fine with Woods and me. He was very wrong.  
  
¬† One month later . . .  
  
¬† Woods  
I glanced over at the phone and considered calling Della. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to her in five hours. My morning had been packed with meetings and conference calls. She never complained. That bothered me. The fact was I thought she should complain. I was failing her. How was I supposed to run the Kerrington Club and take care of her? Any other woman would have been in my office throwing a fit. But never Della.  
  
¬† A swift knock on my door kept me from picking up the phone. I would call her in a minute. ‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I called out, and started looking for the papers Vince had brought me to sign earlier.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVince wasn‚Äôt out there so I knocked.‚Äù Angelina‚Äôs voice wasn‚Äôt what I expected to hear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat does Mother need now?‚Äù I asked without looking up at her. That was why she was here. At first I had been annoyed with her presence but she was helping my mother more than I could. More than I wanted to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe misses you. It‚Äôs been over a week since you called to check on her.‚Äù  
  
¬† Angelina was as good at guilt trips as my mother was. The two of them were so much alike. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call her later today. I‚Äôve got work. If that‚Äôs all, please see yourself out.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to treat me so coldly. I‚Äôm helping you the only way I know how. Every day I stay here with your mother is for you. It‚Äôs all for you. I‚Äôm in love with you, Woods. I can‚Äôt compete for your heart because you won‚Äôt allow me in. But what is she doing for you? I don‚Äôt see her helping you‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough. Don‚Äôt ever put yourself on the same level as Della. I didn‚Äôt ask you to take care of my mother. I can hire someone to help me if I need it. As for Della, she‚Äôs the reason I get out of bed each morning, so never underestimate her importance.‚Äù  
  
¬† Angelina stiffened and opened her mouth to say more. I lowered my angry glare back to the contracts in front of me. I was done with this conversation. ‚ÄúLeave.‚Äù  
  
¬† The clicking of her heels on the hardwood floors as she left the office was the most welcome sound I‚Äôd heard all day.  
  
¬† When the door closed behind her I reached for my phone to call Della.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù her sweet voice said into the phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need you,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just finished a late lunch with Blaire and Bethy. I‚Äôll be right there,‚Äù she replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust come in when you get here,‚Äù I told her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  
  
¬† Exactly ten minutes and fifteen seconds later my door opened and Della stepped inside. Her dark hair was pulled up into a ponytail. The short sundress she was wearing hugged her curves more than I would have preferred. I stood up and walked around my desk.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said with a shy smile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I replied before resting both my hands on her hips and pressing my mouth on hers. Her lips were always so plump and soft. The faint taste of cherries from her lip gloss clung to my tongue.  
  
¬† This was what I needed. This was what got me through each day.  
  
¬† Della broke the kiss and placed her hands on either side of my face. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she asked softly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Della gazed up at me as if she were studying me closely. Then she stepped back and turned to the door. Before I could ask her what she was doing the lock clicked in place.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake off your clothes,‚Äù she said simply, then began to slip the straps of her dress down her shoulders.  
  
¬† I was at a loss for words at the moment. I did as I was told. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off of Della. As her dress pooled at her feet and she stood there in nothing but a pair of pink lace panties and a matching bra, my hands started to tremble. Seeing her like this never got old.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt made love in here yet,‚Äù she said, smiling at me as she unsnapped her bra and let it drop carelessly to the floor.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo we haven‚Äôt,‚Äù I managed to say. When she hooked her fingers in the sides of her panties and started pulling them down, I reached my breaking point. The moment she stepped out of the pink lace I took the two steps separating us and picked her up, and her legs wrapped firmly around me. You couldn‚Äôt call what our mouths were doing kissing. It was too raw for that. We were taking each other. It was the best description I could think of.  
  
¬† I wanted to take her on my desk but we weren‚Äôt going to make it that far. Not after that striptease. I wasn‚Äôt even going to be able to enjoy tasting her and touching her. I needed inside her now before I exploded.  
  
¬† I set her down and flipped her around until she was facing the wall. ‚ÄúBrace yourself,‚Äù I whispered into her ear.  
  
¬† Della leaned forward and placed both her hands against the wall. I took in the sight of her body arched out and my heart slammed against my chest. She was beautiful. Perfect. Grabbing her by the hips, I sank inside of her. The cry of pleasure was so loud I was pretty damn sure Vince had heard it outside at his desk, but I didn‚Äôt care.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo good, it always feels so good,‚Äù I whispered in her ear. The shiver that went over her body made me smile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHarder,‚Äù Della panted, pressing her sweet round ass back against me.  
  
¬† I slammed inside of her and stopped. Buried deep, I leaned forward and caressed her breasts. ‚ÄúYou make me crazy, baby.‚Äù  
  
¬† Della only moaned and wiggled her bottom. She wanted me to move.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so tight. You feel like heaven. I want to stay right here for fucking ever,‚Äù I swore, and I meant it. Della‚Äôs pussy sucked me like the sweetest mouth I‚Äôd ever known.  
  
¬† The tight hole I worshipped squeezed me and I froze. Then she did it again. What the fuck? It was like she was pumping my dick. ‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù I growled. She was gonna make me come way before I wanted to. I slid out of her and back in and the squeezing started again. ‚ÄúBaby, you‚Äôre gonna make me come,‚Äù I said in a strangled voice. I was fighting back the heat tightening in my cock. I was so close. ‚ÄúDella, baby, stop doing that. I‚Äôm gonna fucking explode. I can‚Äôt hold back.‚Äù  
  
¬† She stuck her bottom out farther and the walls of her silky heat squeezed me tighter. It was as if she had just taken the control of my body away from me. I felt myself erupt as I called out her name and my body jerked helplessly against her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes! Oh God, yes!‚Äù Della cried out, and her body went rigid in my arms before it began to shake underneath me. I wrapped both my arms around her and held her as we both came back down from the climax she‚Äôd sent us spiraling off into.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you do to me?‚Äù I asked, holding her close.  
  
¬† She leaned back against my chest and a smile tugged at her lips. ‚ÄúI fucked you and I did a real good job,‚Äù she replied.  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt expected that response. Laughing, I picked her up, carried her over to the nearest chair, and sank down into it with her in my arms.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was incredible,‚Äù I told her before pressing a kiss to her neck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you feel better now?‚Äù she asked, arching her neck so I could access it better.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat depends,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf I can convince you to stay in here with me all day.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have to work,‚Äù she said, turning her head to look up at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMmm, but if you‚Äôre here with me I can concentrate. And then you can get naked for me again and be a naughty girl when I need you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Della threw her head back and laughed. The sound of it made everything in my world right.  
  
¬† Della  
  
¬† The phone on Woods‚Äôs desk beeped twice. ‚ÄúMr. Kerrington, Miss Greystone is here to see you,‚Äù the secretary‚Äôs voice announced through the speaker.  
  
¬† Woods closed his eyes and laid his head back on the chair we were sitting in. ‚ÄúDamn. What the hell does she need now?‚Äù  
  
¬† Did she come here often? I fought back the jealousy that wanted to eat its way inside me. Of course she came by to see him. She was staying with his mother and helping her deal with things, which in turn was helping Woods. Unlike me. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything to help him. I didn‚Äôt know what to do.  
  
¬† I started to get out of his lap but his hands tightened on me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to get dressed.‚Äù  
  
¬†  
; ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me here with her.‚Äù  
  
¬† I leaned over and kissed the tip of his nose. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go anywhere. But I prefer to be wearing clothes when she walks in.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods let out a sigh and let go of me so I could get up and get dressed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou get dressed, too. I don‚Äôt care what she‚Äôs seen before me, I don‚Äôt want her seeing it now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods laughed out loud and stood up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to put my clothes on, sexy. Calm down.‚Äù  
  
¬† We both grinned at each other as we dressed. I liked the idea of her coming in here and seeing us together and knowing what we had been doing. It was silly for me to feel that way, but I did.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can send her in,‚Äù Woods replied, standing at his desk while he watched me fix my hair, which our wild sex had messed up. My ponytail was barely hanging on.  
  
¬† The door swung open and I spun around to see Angelina strutting inside like she belonged here. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you . . .‚Äù Her voice trailed off as her gaze landed on me. I finished adjusting my ponytail and let my hands fall back down to my sides.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you really just‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you back?‚Äù Woods cut off her question.  
  
¬† Angelina jerked her gaze to him as if he‚Äôd slapped her. I watched as she fought to compose herself. Woods hadn‚Äôt bothered to run his fingers through his hair and it was messed up from my hands being in it. I bit back a smile as I looked at his properly rumpled appearance.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI came back to tell you your mother wants to have you over for dinner,‚Äù Angelina said tightly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUnless Della is invited, I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to make it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Angelina let out a frustrated sigh and shot me an annoyed glance before looking back at Woods. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your mother, Woods. She just lost her husband and she‚Äôs hurting. You‚Äôre all she has left. Don‚Äôt you get that? Do you not care?‚Äù  
  
¬† She was right. Woods‚Äôs mother might never like me. But she was his mother, and right now she needed him. ‚ÄúI want you to go, Woods,‚Äù I said before he could say anything.  
  
¬† He looked over at me and frowned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said, hoping he wouldn‚Äôt argue with me in front of her.  
  
¬† Woods ran a hand through his hair and I smiled at the way it was still messed up. He was adorable like that. ‚ÄúFine. But only for an hour. This will also be a one-time thing. Next time I have dinner with her, Della will be with me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Angelina‚Äôs annoyed grimace turned into a pleased smile. She would get him tonight, too, without me around. I hated that but I couldn‚Äôt let it keep Woods from his mother.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre thinking with something other than your dick,‚Äù Angelina replied before spinning around and heading out the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a bitch. Ignore her,‚Äù Woods said, shoving off from the desk he‚Äôd been leaning on and walking over to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I assured him, but deep down I worried that she was right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre at the door, Della. Don‚Äôt let them in here. They‚Äôll hurt us. All they want to do is hurt us. We have to keep your brother safe. They tried to kill him before. They‚Äôll kill us this time. Don‚Äôt let them in. Shhhh. Stop that crying, you little brat! You have to be quiet. So very quiet, then they‚Äôll go away.‚Äù  
  
¬† I covered my mouth with both my hands to keep in the terrified cries I couldn‚Äôt control. I hated when this happened. Mom would get mean afterward. She didn‚Äôt like it when people knocked on our door. It upset her. And she would talk to him. He wasn‚Äôt there, but she saw him. That scared me, too.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet up! They‚Äôre gone. Go to the door and get the package they left and be careful that they don‚Äôt see you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt want to open the door. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was out there that wanted to get me, but I didn‚Äôt want to open the door. Momma had been making me do that more and more lately. Since my sixth birthday.  
  
¬† Pain seared my head as she wrapped her hand around my ponytail and jerked me to my feet. I couldn‚Äôt let her hear me cry or this would get worse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù she screamed in that voice that sent chills down my body. The hard shove from her hands sent me stumbling out of the closet and into the hallway. She would stay in the closet until I came back with the package.  
  
¬† I glanced back at her but instead of seeing her wild, distant eyes there was blood. It was pouring out of the room and into the hallway. No . . . no, there wasn‚Äôt supposed to be blood.  
  
¬† Then a shrill scream of terror ripped from the small room.  
  
¬† I jolted straight up and the scream was still echoing around me as it tore from my chest. It was my own scream. It was always my scream. Not my mother‚Äôs.  
  
¬† I was still alone. Looking around the living room, I took slow, deep breaths while my heart kept hammering against my chest. I pulled my legs up and tucked my knees under my chest. Falling asleep without Woods here wasn‚Äôt something I did often. Having him near me while I slept kept me from having night terrors for the most part.  
  
¬† The clock on the fridge said it was after nine. He should have been home over an hour ago. Had he stayed later with his mother? I reached for my phone on the coffee table and saw that I had two missed calls and one text message. All from Woods.  
  
¬† I clicked the text message.  
  
¬† {tm}Please answer. I‚Äôm worried about you and Mom passed out during dinner. I think she hasn‚Äôt been eating properly. Call me!{tx}  
  
¬† That had been ten minutes ago. I jumped up from the couch and started to dial his number when the front door swung open and Woods came running inside. His eyes locked on mine and he stopped and let out a deep breath. ‚ÄúThank God. Shit, baby, you scared me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I dropped my phone and walked over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I just woke up. I fell asleep on the couch. How‚Äôs your mother?‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods pulled me against him and wrapped his arms around me. ‚ÄúShe was too weak to stand up so I called an ambulance. Angelina kept saying it could be a stroke. She rode in the ambulance with Mom so I could come back here and check on you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pushed at his chest. ‚ÄúGo! Go to the hospital. No, wait, let me get my shoes, I‚Äôm going too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure? If you‚Äôre tired I don‚Äôt want to drag you to the hospital. We could be there all night.‚Äù  
  
¬† I slipped my feet into a pair of tennis shoes and ran my hands through my hair. ‚ÄúI want to be with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Woods smiled and held out his hand for me. ‚ÄúGood. I won‚Äôt be able to focus if I‚Äôm worried about you here alone. If you need to sleep, I can always hold you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I tried not to think about the fact that Angelina was helping him take care of his mother. He had been able to leave her knowing she would be there beside his mother. What was I good for? He had to worry about me. I was weak and needy. I was one more thing for him to stress over. I wasn‚Äôt any help at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop frowning. She‚Äôs gonna be okay. The paramedics said there‚Äôs a good chance her potassium is low. They don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stroke but they said due to her heart rate we needed to admit her and let doctors check her out.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded as he laced his fingers through mine. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù I told him.  
  
¬† I was going to find a way to be helpful. He needed someone to lean on right now and I was going to be that someone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you sleep okay without me here?‚Äù he asked as we stepped outside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. I slept great,‚Äù I lied, because telling him the truth would only have upset him.  
  
¬† Woods  
  
¬† Della had finally given in and curled up against me. She‚Äôd been asleep within minutes. It was after three in the morning and they had Mom in a room under observation. Angelina was in the room with her. It was better that way.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt stupid. I knew Angelina wasn‚Äôt helping my mother out of the goodness of her heart. She had no goodness in her heart. She was doing it to get to me. It wasn‚Äôt like my mother needed a live-in nurse. Just a friend, and Angelina was being her friend.  
  
¬† Della didn‚Äôt seem to mind. I had been watching to make sure it didn‚Äôt get to her. The moment it seemed like Della was upset about Angelina‚Äôs still being in our lives in this capacity,  
I would end all connection with my mom until Angelina left. She would eventually leave anyway when she realized I didn‚Äôt want her and nothing she did was going to change that. Della owned me. She always would.  
  
¬† Della started to whimper in her sleep. I pulled her into my lap, brushed her hair back off her face, and whispered in her ear. That always calmed her. She rarely had bad dreams anymore. I normally saw them coming on and stopped them before they could take over.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have you, I‚Äôm right here. You‚Äôre in my arms and nothing can touch you, Della. Nothing, baby. I won‚Äôt let it,‚Äù I assured her as her breathing returned to normal and her body eased back into a peaceful sleep. Smiling, I pressed a kiss to the side of her hair. I liked knowing I could fight off her fear. It was a powerful drug to know all she needed was me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that get exhausting? She‚Äôs like a helpless, needy child.‚Äù Angelina‚Äôs icy voice annoyed me. I didn‚Äôt look up at her. I‚Äôd rather have kept my focus on the woman in my arms.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Mom?‚Äù I asked her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sleeping. She hasn‚Äôt been eating well. I knew that but I can‚Äôt force her to eat. I‚Äôm not a damn nurse. If you came to visit her more often she‚Äôd eat more. She misses you.‚Äù  
  
¬† My mother had never missed me. She was my father‚Äôs puppet. She wanted me around if he did. When she thought I was going to marry Angelina she wanted me around.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre choosing her over your mother and it‚Äôs disappointing, Woods.‚Äù  
  
¬† I lifted my eyes from Della‚Äôs peaceful face. ‚ÄúNo. My mother is choosing her wants over mine. I will not live my life the way she wants me to. I will love who the fuck I wanna love. She doesn‚Äôt control that,‚Äù I replied in a cold voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have the Kerrington Club to run, Woods. You need someone who can stand by you and help you. You have to take care of not only the club but her. She‚Äôs a weight on you, not a help. You can‚Äôt be a successful businessman with a burden like her,‚Äù she said, pointing at Della.  
  
¬† I held her closer to my chest. I could do anything if I had Della. Anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre not understanding‚Äîwhat my mother is not understanding‚Äîis I can‚Äôt live without Della. I can‚Äôt breathe. I can‚Äôt fucking concentrate. I need her. Just her. I can do anything if I have her with me. So take your snide comments and beliefs and leave me the hell alone. I know what I need and it will never be you. Did you hear that? Is it sinking in this time? It. Will. Never. Be. You.

It‚Äôs two bedrooms and about 1000 square ft. With community fees, rent, and parking, it ends up being about $2400/month. It‚Äôs extremely close to Alameda Station if you like to utilize public transportation. It‚Äôs about 2 blocks from south broadway, so tons of shops, food, and coffee.

1me428m,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1me428m/how_do_you_chose_a_caterer_out_of_state_safe_and/,How do you chose a caterer out of state? Safe and over budget or gamble and under budget?,"Hi looking for advice if anyone is super bored today lol. We got our caterering down to 5 options. We are out of state so we cannot do a taste test. How do you even pick?? 

**About our budget: $13,500**. Our goal was for this to include 4 passed apps at cocktail hour, upgraded plated salad, bread service, water service, coffee service, family style dinner with 3 entrees and 2 sides, cake and cake cutting, late night snack, china, flatware, water goblets, linens, napkins, all service fees, tax, and gratuity. The five options below either include all of this or more, I note if something was missing in the quote and add the expected extra cost. 

We are very happy with the menu selections with each caterer they are almost all identical, its just now about day of execution.. do we gamble on quality and/or service to stay in budget (could still be great we just dont have anyway to confirm) or do we go a bit over budget to know we are in the best hands?

**Option 1**: Everyone comments recommending them saying that are the best wedding food around, have never seen a bad review, won local awards this year, recommended by our future wedding coordinator, i have seen them tagged at our venue, but after getting a quote with allll the bells and whistles we wanted came in 9% ($1,200) over budget. Linens and napkins did come in at a crazy $1,100 though so we feel we could do better there because we dont have to use theirs (150 people)? We still estimate needing $350 for cake. The quote did not include gratuity. They also say that if food prices drastically change they can increase our prices up to 14 days before the event. So it‚Äôs really **$15,050 plus gratuity.**

**Option 2:** Also receives amazing comments praising them, only saw one single facebook comment from a while ago saying they thought their food was too salty, won local awards awards, preferred vendor at our venue, also recommended to us by our future wedding coordinator but came in 2.5% percent over budget ($250) but this is missing 1. Linens and napkins, 2. Coffee service (the above has and my partner wants this), 3. $350 for cake, 4. does not include gratuity. If the cost of linens and napkins were the same as option one (to be fair for comparison since we can work on linens for both), then option two costs more than option one at **$15,300 plus coffee and gratuity.**

**Option 3:** This is a custom caterer/ private chef. I have seen facebook comments praising them but they have almost no reviews online. They are not present on the typical wedding review sites. Based on our chat we think their food probably tastes amazing, maybe even the best on the list, but the guy is such a talker. Not such a problem but he kept pushing his wife‚Äôs table scape business on us which we know we cannot afford. They have not worked at our venue before and I think typically cater smaller weddings but we dont know because there is not much out there on them. He came in only $100 dollars over budget and includes gratuity. His quote is missing 1. Linens and Napkins, 2. $350 for cake, 3. Did not list bread or salad for dinner (we think its included but need to confirm), 4. Plastic cake plates and utensils, 5. Unsure if this included tax. If we are being fair and add that $1,100 of linens they cost the exact same as option one, **$15,050, but gratuity already being included is a huge bonus.** Would need to confirm salad, bread, and tax are included.

**Option 4:** Not many reviews online but the reviews that exist are all positive. We have pretty much no information on them which is scary for me. They are however on the preferred vendor list of our venue, this is how we found them. They did respond right away to our quote request with a detailed quote but did not much effort in more communication. Their quote came in $1380 under budget (11% under budget). This is missing 1. $350 for cake, 2. They do not offer late night snack so we are thinking $400 for pizza delivery, 3. Linens and napkins. If we stay consistent with the first linens and napkins quote and add in the extras they are at **$13,970 including gratuity.**

**Option 5:** A bit farther away and has never worked at our venue before. I do not see people recommending them on facebook like I do with the first three vendors but I also don‚Äôt see recommendations against them. Some reviews on the traditional wedding website were not super happy with their service/food quality day of but I have to be fair there are also sooo many 5 stars. Hundreds of good reviews. What also worries me is it took us reaching out 3 times to be contacted back but once they realized our inquiry was buried in their inbox they got to it immediately. Their quote came in just under $1000 under budget (7.5% under). This quote is only missing cake, $350. So they are at **$12,860 including gratuity, so $640 under budget.**

Thanks all!!! 

Edit: we of course could tone down what we want a bit to stay in budget with any caterer but we aren‚Äôt sure what we would want to sacrifice. I do think I can get the linens cost down. We also could just do costco sheet cake. If needed we could also skip late night snack. And we could subtract coffee service from our bar budget, or try to get the bartender to provide it. 

We also did not include vendor meals in this budget because I am actually going to include that in the budget set for the respective vendors.

We are hoping we only have 150 guests but you know how that goes, could be more or less",1,1753974407.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

What started as a simple search for a few DnD friends has turned into something much bigger and we could not be more excited.

Originally, we expected maybe four or five responses when we posted about building a friend group similar to us (parents and 25-30). Now we have grown into a community of over 140 people from all kinds of backgrounds and interests.

This group is for everyone 21 and up who is looking to connect, make genuine friendships, and find others who share their hobbies. Not just parents! Whether you want to create a DnD campaign, local coffee shop book club, or finding a group to go to conventions with, we hope this space helps you find your people to create your own events/meet ups. 

We will be hosting in person meetups and want to be a starting point for anyone to build their own hangouts, game nights, or campaigns.

Thank you again for being part of this. We are so excited to continue growing with you.

I wake my wife up as I'm getting dressed at 6:15. I usually start my wife's coffee on her little ninja coffee maker before I head out the door (I hate coffee personally) My 6 (almost 7) yr old daughter gets up about 6ish most days, and started asking to help make mommy's coffee. So I showed her how to change filter, how much coffee to add, how to fill the water, and how to do the whisk foamer. 

  
So for the past few months she's been actually making mommy's coffee every morning. My wife had no idea that her morning coffee was being prepared by a 6 yr old until today when I woke up late and kinda flew out the door without starting it. She got up saw there was no coffee, evidentially mentioned it to the child and my daughter went ahead and made her coffee like she normally does. My wife texted me this morning wondering how long this has been going on.

Can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that we're living in an age where **AI is literally buzzing with monetization opportunities** just waiting for us to hop on board? üöÄ But here's the kicker‚Äîif we don‚Äôt act soon, we could be leaving *serious cash on the table*. Like, why would we ever do that?! Let‚Äôs break it down!

**What am I talking about?** 

You might be saying, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm already swamped with projects!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù Trust me, I get it. We‚Äôre all juggling different things. But consider these brilliant yet simple ideas that can start cashing in on those AI tools that are flying off the shelves (or should I say *clouds*?).  

Here‚Äôs a quick list of **nudges for your consideration**:

1. **Automate Your Content Creation**:  
   - Have you tried using AI tools for blog posts or social media updates? I‚Äôve been dabbling in it, and let me tell you, it‚Äôs like having a personal assistant who never takes coffee breaks! ‚òïÔ∏è Plus, it frees up time for *actual* creativity!

2. **AI Art Sales**:  
   - If you dabble in design, AI art generators can transform your concepts into delightful pieces that can be sold online. I legitimately made a profit from an AI-generated piece last month. Who knew creations could come from a few prompt tweaks?

3. **Subscription Models**:  
   - Think about launching an AI tool or content subscription service. You‚Äôd be surprised how many folks want personalized, AI-generated reports or articles. It‚Äôs a win-win; they get unique content, and you get paid for your brilliance!

4. **Consultation and Courses**:  
   - Leverage your knowledge! Create an online course showcasing how to effectively use AI tools. I know courses can feel like a daunting task, but remember‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt teach if you‚Äôre passionate about it!

5. **Affiliate Marketing**:  
   - You love a tool? Talk about it! If you recommend an AI platform and they sign up through your link, ka-ching! üíµ Simple as that! 

Okay, but why is it important to hop on this ASAP? Because like a flash sale at your favorite store, these opportunities don‚Äôt last forever! The market is rapidly evolving, and staying ahead means not only keeping up but also **getting creative and inspired**.

So here‚Äôs my challenge to you: What‚Äôs one tiny step you're willing to take today to capitalize on an AI opportunity? Have you tried any of the ideas here? Or maybe you‚Äôve got your own that‚Äôs worked wonders for you? 

Let‚Äôs keep this convo rolling! Feeling those motivational vibes yet? ü§© Remember, you‚Äôre in the driver‚Äôs seat; so let‚Äôs not stall‚Äîkeep the momentum going! üí™üíñ",1,1753973782.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1me3rlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mushrooms/comments/1me3rlx/15_years_into_mushroom_growing_contamination/,"1.5 years into mushroom growing: contamination, small wins, and stuff I wish I‚Äôd known when I started","Hey all, figured it was finally time to post instead of just lurking and frantically googling ‚Äúgreen mold or just bruising??‚Äù

I‚Äôve been dabbling in home mushroom growing for about a year and a half now. It started with one of those all-in-one grow bags I got online- didn‚Äôt fruit at all, grew a bunch of weird fuzz, and I assumed I‚Äôd just messed it up. Spoiler: I had. But I got weirdly hooked anyway.

Since then I‚Äôve gone through PF Tek, shoeboxes, monotubs, grow bags, and made peace with the fact that contamination is just part of the process. I‚Äôve had tubs get taken over by Trich within days, blocks that never pinned, and some mushrooms that came out looking like aliens. But also a few solid flushes that made it all feel worth it.

Definitely not an expert- just someone who‚Äôs made a lot of basic mistakes and slowly started figuring it out. Posting in case anyone else is in that early stage where you're just kind of winging it and wondering if it's supposed to look that fuzzy.

# Stuff that‚Äôs actually helped me:

**-Be clean, but don‚Äôt spiral**  
In the beginning I was obsessed with sterility. I‚Äôd wipe down everything with alcohol like I was prepping for surgery. Turns out being clean matters, but you don‚Äôt need a lab setup. I just aim for consistent habits: wash hands, flame sterilize needles, still air box for anything delicate. Contam still happens sometimes, and that‚Äôs fine.

**-Don‚Äôt overdo the misting**  
I definitely drowned some cakes early on. I thought I had to mist constantly if the surface didn‚Äôt look perfectly glistening. Now I just aim for decent surface conditions, and trust the mushrooms to do their thing.

**-Smaller is simpler**  
Doing smaller runs (like one or two shoeboxes) made it way easier to learn what worked. Less heartbreak if something gets trashed, and easier to tweak things without feeling like I‚Äôve wasted a month of work.

**Use plant apps for tracking/logging**  
I‚Äôve been using a couple of basic apps to log stuff like inoculation dates, colonization progress, when tubs went into fruiting, that kind of thing. It‚Äôs helped me notice patterns- like how long certain strains usually take to pin, or how often I forget to mist lol. Mostly used¬†[Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=R_my), the IDs and health scan features for mushrooms I found more accurate than most, which was nice when I was just first starting out and wanted an extra reassurance on top of forum posts. That said, I still prefer the interface on apps like Planta and a few others. (Always double check on forums or reddits like this one though)

# Stuff I totally messed up:

**Touched everything**  
Why did I touch so many things with ungloved hands? Why did I peek under the foil constantly? I‚Äôve since learned to stop babying it. Less is more.

**Didn‚Äôt learn the difference between good fuzz and mold**  
I tossed out so many jars just because they got a bit fluffy. Learned the hard way that healthy mycelium can look weird, and not every off-white spot is the enemy.

**Started too big, too fast**  
Once I got one decent flush, I went full chaos mode and tried to do five tubs at once. Got overwhelmed, lost track of what was what, and basically wasted time and spores. Now I keep it small and steady.

**Used old spore syringes without testing**  
I‚Äôve since learned to always test a syringe on a small jar first. Learned this the hard way after knocking up a whole batch that just... never grew anything.

# What‚Äôs kept me into it:

Honestly, it‚Äôs weirdly calming now. I check on my tubs in the morning while making coffee, maybe fan them out a little, admire a pin that wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. It‚Äôs low-key, satisfying, and kind of feels like watching a little ecosystem do its thing.

If you‚Äôre just starting out: go slow, be patient, and accept that you‚Äôre probably gonna grow some mold. It‚Äôs part of it. Once you get your first actual flush though? Feels like magic.

Would love to hear what grows or teks people started with, or any weird mistakes you‚Äôve made (so I feel slightly less cursed). Mycology‚Äôs been one of the weirdest but most rewarding hobbies I‚Äôve picked up, and I‚Äôm excited to keep messing it up and learning more.

Let me know if you want shorter or more meme-y versions, or one tailored to specific mushrooms (like cubes, oysters, etc.)!",4,1753973730.0,Mushrooms,2,0.83,False
1me3qh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1me3qh7/uncover_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Uncover if the best single serve coffee maker by Keurig K50 lives up to the hype,"Daily life and busy mornings call for simplicity, and the Keurig K-50 Coffee Maker fits right into that groove. Being someone who cherishes a good cup of coffee before tackling the day, I found myself putting this single-serve coffee maker to the test. Keurig has long been heralded as the go-to for convenience and variety, and this model doesn‚Äôt disappoint, though a few quirks stood out during my time with it.  

**Design and Ease of Use**  
One of the first things that caught my attention with the Keurig K-50 was its straightforward design. The matte black finish is sleek, blending seamlessly into most kitchen countertops without demanding attention. Its compact nature, with dimensions of 9.8"" D x 13.3"" W x 13"" H, makes it a worthy companion for smaller kitchens or spaces. The button controls are intuitive‚Äîno steep learning curve necessary. Whether it‚Äôs my groggy morning self or a guest unfamiliar with the machine, it‚Äôs easy to pop in a pod, select the brew size, and have a hot cup ready in under a minute.

[Check Keurig K-50 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b018uq5ams/)

**Performance And Versatility**  
The brewing options‚Äî6, 8, or 10-ounce sizes‚Äîreally provide versatility. On days when I needed that potent caffeine kick, the 6-ounce strong brew got the job done; on calmer afternoons, the 10-ounce size was perfect for sipping. However, I noticed the machine doesn't always yield super robust flavors, especially if you prefer bolder coffee. Those who lean towards gourmet or third-wave coffee styles might notice a difference. It‚Äôs important to mention that the machine does brew more than just coffee‚Äîtea and hot cocoa lovers will appreciate the variety.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
If you‚Äôre like me and despise complicated appliances, maintenance for the Keurig K-50 is refreshingly simple. The removable 48-ounce reservoir is a game-changer. It allows multiple brews before needing a refill, which saves time during the early rush. Cleaning the reservoir is hassle-free too. However, one thing worth noting is the descaling requirement. Over time, calcium deposits can accumulate, affecting performance. While the descaling process isn‚Äôt difficult, it‚Äôs an added step some might forget or delay handling, and this could impact the machine‚Äôs longevity.  

**Energy Efficiency and Auto-Off Feature**  
I value appliances that don‚Äôt guzzle energy, and the auto-off feature on the Keurig K-50 is noteworthy. After two hours of inactivity, the coffee maker shuts itself off. This not only saves energy but also gives peace of mind when I rush out the door without double-checking everything. That said, there's no real customizable settings to tweak this feature‚Äîsomething worth thinking about if you want precise control.  

**Highlights**  
- Simple button control mechanism makes brewing easy for anyone.  
- Multiple pod sizes cater to individual preferences.  
- Large 48-ounce water reservoir conserves time by reducing refill frequency.  

**Limitations**  
- Coffee strength might feel lacking for those preferring rich and bold brews.  
- Descaling is essential yet could be an inconvenience if ignored.  
- The lack of adjustable energy-saving or brew-strength settings may deter some.  

**Competing Products**  
In evaluating similar models, contenders like the Nespresso Essenza Mini came to mind. The Essenza Mini is designed for a higher-end experience, often producing a more flavorful espresso-style brew. However, it lacks the versatility of K-cup compatibility, which the Keurig dominates. Another close competitor would be the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which combines both single-serve and traditional coffee pot options in one machine. While that dual functionality is appealing, the FlexBrew tends to be bulkier and slightly harder to clean. Where the Keurig K-50 shines is in speed and its near-universal support for K-cups, offering variety with minimal fuss.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the product‚Äôs feature set, the Keurig K-50 holds its ground as an affordable, reliable choice for coffee lovers. While priced reasonably, it‚Äôs worth contemplating how it compares to rivals offering similar features. Its sturdy design and quick performance justify the cost, but regular maintenance like descaling might give some pause. All in all, the value this machine delivers feels spot-on for those prioritizing simplicity and speed above all else.

1me3pey,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1me3pey/why_is_the_omega_nc900_juicer_the_best/,Why is the Omega NC900 Juicer the Best Masticating Juicer Choice,"Testing the Omega NC900HRD19 has been an adventure for my kitchen routine. As someone who loves incorporating fresh juices and trying out DIY food recipes, this masticating juicer felt like a solid companion. It boasts an impressive 15-year coverage on parts and performance, setting a high standard for durability. I unpacked it, admired the vibrant red design, and immediately noticed how sturdy it felt. Its uncoated finish and stainless steel blades reflect a commitment to quality, giving a reassuring sense that it‚Äôs built to last. But amidst the excitement, there were definitely some quirks worth noting along the way.

**The Design and Build Shine Bright**  
My eyes were immediately drawn to the bold, red color of this juicer. It adds a pop of personality to any countertop without looking tacky. The dimensions‚Äî19.22""D x 7.25""W x 12.96""H‚Äîare pretty manageable considering its range of capabilities. Although, I‚Äôll admit, it can weigh you down at 18.7 pounds if frequent movement is on your agenda. The robust, corded electric design makes it feel like a professional piece of equipment. The larger feed chute is an appreciated upgrade over previous Omega models I‚Äôve seen. Prepping fruits and veggies was a much quicker job, and that alone saved me precious time during a busy morning.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Using the Omega NC900HRD19 felt satisfying and efficient. Masticating juicers are known for their slow pace, and this one operates at 80 RPM, keeping oxidation and heat buildup to a minimum. I saw firsthand how this optimal speed retained the vibrant color and fresh taste of juices. Carrots, apples, spinach‚Äîyou name it‚Äîit extracted every possible drop of nutrient-rich liquid. The five adjustable pressure settings were surprisingly effective, letting me tweak the output depending on the toughness of the ingredients. Anyone who‚Äôs ever struggled to juice celery will appreciate how smooth it works with this handy feature.  

Check [Omega NC900HRD19](https://cncgn.com/p/b09ffxrblb/) price on Amazon.

**Exploring Its Multifunctionality**  
What truly separates this masticating juicer from the rest is its nutrition system. I wasn‚Äôt just juicing; I was making batches of almond milk, turning nuts into creamy butter, and even grinding coffee beans just to test it out. It felt like the Swiss Army knife of kitchen gadgets. Not stopping there, I played around with the nozzles, and there are six of them! It even supports food processing features like creating homemade baby food or sorbets. I had a moment of fooling myself into thinking I could forego other kitchen appliances. While it can handle diverse tasks fairly well, it‚Äôs worth noting that pasta extruding didn‚Äôt feel as seamless compared to other tools specifically designed for that.

**Ease of Cleaning is Relative**  
If you‚Äôve ever cleaned a juicer, you know the struggle. This one isn‚Äôt the easiest or the hardest; it falls somewhere in the middle. Hand washing is the recommended care routine, which feels old-fashioned, but I understand why. With parts this intricately designed, durability tends to favor manual care. Luckily, the automatic pulp ejection feature means you don‚Äôt have to constantly stop and clean mid-use, making cleanup post-operation more bearable.

**Merits**  
- The slow speed preserves enzymes and nutrients beautifully.  
- Handles leafy greens as well as hard vegetables with ease.  
- Compact design and sturdy build feel long-lasting.  
- The multifunctional system adds immense value to its versatility.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Heavier than expected, making it less portable.  
- Cleaning requirements can be a little tedious for daily juicers.  

**Competing Products That Caught My Attention**  
I‚Äôve tried Breville‚Äôs centrifugal juicers in the past, which are faster but inevitably heat the juice due to high RPM. The Omega NC900HRD19 clearly wins if nutrition retention is your priority. Meanwhile, Kuvings‚Äô slow juicer is another competitor, excelling with broader feed chutes and fewer settings to fiddle with, yet it doesn‚Äôt match up to Omega in terms of added features like nut butter and soy milk preparation. Both cost similarly, but if versatility matters more, Omega‚Äôs got the advantage.

**Quality for Price**  
The pricing of this juicer aligns well with its feature-packed design. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest masticating juicer around, the extra capabilities justify the investment.

I was born and raised here. I love my city, but lately, I feel like a stranger in it. Prices have gone *insane*. A coffee in some areas now costs what it used to cost in Milan, and don‚Äôt get me started on rent or just going out to eat. Everything feels inflated just because tourists will pay whatever.

The historic center? It‚Äôs a theme park now. I avoid it like the plague unless I absolutely have to go through there. Crowds everywhere, people sitting on fountains eating gelato, taking selfies on monuments like it‚Äôs Disneyland. You can‚Äôt enjoy the beauty of the place anymore, it‚Äôs just a mass of people all day, every day.

And food... The restaurants in the center are a joke. Frozen pasta, bad carbonara, microwaved lasagna, all served with a smile to people who think they‚Äôre getting ‚Äúauthentic Italian.‚Äù Real Romans don‚Äôt eat in these places, and we haven‚Äôt for years, but now even places that *used* to be good are cutting corners to keep up with the tourist demand. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

I know tourism is important. I get that it helps the economy. But seriously, this can‚Äôt go on forever like this. Rome is losing its soul just to make quick money off people who‚Äôll be here for 3 days and then never think about it again.

Is anyone else feeling this way, or am I just turning into a grumpy old Roman?",59,1753973464.0,rome,48,0.9,False

1me33t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1me33t0/coffee_report_from_montreal_eastern_townships/,"Coffee report from Montreal, Eastern Townships","Just got back from a 5-night trip to Montreal and Sutton, QC.  Was able to hit a pretty good number of coffee shops, many of which I learned out here.  So I thought it was only fair to report back on how it went!

Day 1: Cafe Paquebot, Mile End.  Offbeat, hip-ish coffee shop with a good selection of Canadian roasters I'd heard of (September, Zab, Traffic) plus some I hadn't (Even, Angry Roaster) available by the bag.  First pourover of the trip was perhaps the best - an Ethiopian natural from Even.  Super fruity, totally got the notes of blueberry and mango from the box.

Day 2 (am): Cafe Caron and Freres, up near Little Italy.  Even more great bags for sale: Traffic, Hatch, Cafe Yamabiko, and also Dak.  My wife and kids had a tiramisu iced latte - as it sounds, way over the top..... and delicious.  Served with a ladyfinger perched on the edge.  I went for a cortado - and they made it with Milky Cake.  Wow.  Tons of long-lasting flavor.  Cardamom and baking spices totally came through.  Sat and sipped and savored that one for a while. 

Day 2 (pm): Structure Cafe, downtown.  Very clean, cool, serious coffee shop.  Super nice baristas, and one of them was their roaster, great guy.  Had fun conversation with them about coffee as they poured me a V60 of their Magnolia blend.  It was a combo Ethiopian natural and Honduran Gesha washed.  Even though it was made right in front of me, which was a great experience, I have to say the coffee itself wasn't as good as the batch brew from Paquebot.  Which in some ways is surprising but the more I think about it (and read in this sub) the more I'm realizing that the right-in-front-of-you preparation is perhaps not always the best option.  Or at least has more opportunity for hits or misses.  Or perhaps it was just that I didn't love the blend - or that I really really loved the Even coffee.  (The baristas offered me a free taste of another of their coffees, a Kenyan, and it was quite good.)  Anyway, absolutely still a great experience, and I totally recommend Structure.

Day 3 (am): 49th Parallel, downtown.  Miserable night of sleep after the late-in-the-day large serving of caffeine from Structure, so went with a decaf cortado.  Which is often a recipe for something miserable - burnt, over-roasted, old.  Whew, not this time.  One of the better decaf espresso drinks I've had.  Could totally taste the rich flavors of the coffee, but definitely not overcooked.  Still had a lovely fruity and floral edge to it - fresh, vibrant.  I wish I'd had the opportunity to try this place again, would have loved to see how good their non-decaf stuff is.    

Day 3 (pm): Visited Dreamy / Canadian Roasting Society.  Wow.  I heard it compared to Sephora for coffee, and that's not wrong.  Basically CRS is a place where tons of local roasters can pay a monthly fee to rent high-end equipment and come in and do their roasting.  Which lets people grow their business without having to invest in $$$ equipment right off the bat.  Super cool -- and a super added bonus is that they sell bags of basically all the roasters who use them.  I've never been anywhere with a larger selection of freshly roasted bags.  I limited myself to just two: one from Colorfull, another from Escape, but it took all my willpower (and whining teenagers) to not spend an hour just walking through the shelves.  If you're in Montreal, totally worth the extra effort to get out here.  I didn't try any of the drinks there because by this time it was almost 5pm, but I bet those were good, too.   

Day 4 (am #1): Cafe Yamabiko, Sutton QC.  By this point we're in the Eastern Townships, an hour east.  Super cute cafe right in the ""downtown"" area of Sutton, which turned out to be our favorite of the Townships.  Had their batch brew Rwandan pourover - wow, talk about a light fruity blast of flavor. I drink a lot of the ""wild"" stuff (anaerobic, co-fermented, etc) but this was just purely from the beans.  Delicious.  Absolutely loved the cafe -- beautiful on the inside, great seating on the outdoor grassy patio out back.  Delicious pastries and bars and such as well.  Had a very pleasant conversation with two knowledgeable coffee drinkers from Montreal who recommended other places to visit on my next visit: Cafe Even (remember them from Day 1?) and White Heron.  Somehow neither of those got onto my radar for this trip.  Something to look forward to next time. 

Day 4 (am #2): Cafe Yamabiko, a few minutes later....  Went back for another drink, this time a cortado.  Had two options - classic, or fruity.  Went with fruity.  I wish I'd written down which coffee it was - because it was delicious.  (I don't know why I think I'll ""just remember"" these things.)  At this point it's a tie between this and the Milky Cake for best cortado of the visit.  Had a brief conversation with the owner, and she helped me pick out a bag to take home.  I was torn between the Rwandan I'd had earlier as a pourover, and another more processed one called Essential Oils.  Went with the Essential Oils - smells amazing.  If you are anywhere in the ET and don't go to Cafe Yamabiko, you're missing out.  

Day 5 (pm): Caron and Freres, Knowlton.  Drove to the next town over to hit another Caron and Freres, after the first one was so great.  I didn't love the looks of what they had on pourover -- but as their ""fruity"" espresso drink they had the Essential Oils from Yamabiko!  Couldn't resist.  Got yet another cortado (sorry, maybe I should have just put this in r/espresso) - and wow.  Explosively flavorful - tropical fruits and maybe even some coconut?  I'm never able to get my Breville Bambino to make espresso anywhere near this good -- starting to understand why people shell out $1k and up for espresso machines.  Now it's a 3-way tie for best espresso drink with Yamabiko and the first Caron and Freres with Milky Cake.  

Geez, sorry that got so long.  Hope this is helpful to anybody who's looking for Montreal info.  TL;DR - Montreal/ET has some great shops serving some fantastic Canadian coffee.

Looking for hygge & grounding while staying nomadic.,"After a few years of bouncing around, I‚Äôve grappled with travel burnout a few times. I *don‚Äôt* want to stop moving, but I do want to feel grounded instead of lost. When I arrive somewhere new I tidy the space, light a candle or incense, rearrange furniture, and seek out a local caf√© or market. These little rituals give me a ‚Äúhygge‚Äù vibe‚Äîa cosy, contented feeling‚Äîeven if I‚Äôm only there for a month.

I‚Äôve read some great threads recently where digital nomads say the things that make a place feel like home are often *people* and *routines*. They start to feel settled once they‚Äôve been recognised at their neighbourhood coffee shop or have a regular gym and market. Others bring a favourite mug, fairy lights or a small plant so every Airbnb has their personal stamp. A few folks need a month or more to feel at home, while some know in a few days.

For those of you who‚Äôve been nomading for some time:  
‚Äì What routines help you ground yourself?  
‚Äì Do you have personal items that instantly make a short‚Äëterm rental feel warm and welcoming?  
‚Äì How do you balance exploring with building a cosy space to recharge?  
‚Äì Have you found any rituals or d√©cor tips (hygge, feng shui, etc.) that work especially well?

I‚Äôd love to hear how others deal with this so we can all keep travelling without losing that sense of home.",6,1753972118.0,digitalnomad,6,0.8,False

Uuxz was an even less settled world in the Axxaakk Reformation than Xumiir, but it was the location of the best academy that Advocate-Lord Marrik-James and Recorder-Lady Tashmetum-Magdalene could afford.  The best military academy they could afford.  The planet didn't even have a station yet.  It was, however, the destination for their daughter.  Vincent had been surprised to hear from the young noble that she wanted to abandon the path her parents and lineage had set out for her.  Then again, their lineage as legal professionals was only three generations old.  Not that long a run to make a break a rejection of tradition.  On the other hand, if they were too changeable they'd have a terribly hard time establishing those traditions.  Vincent didn't dwell on it too much.  He simply hoped that the path she walked now would lead her well.

As it turned out, being parents to one of the heroic children who risked their lives to warn everybody about the impending attack by the grub controller enabled Marrik-James and Tashmetum-Magdalene to afford more than a pittance for educating their daughter.  Not that the Empress's Gift was useful for anything else, but they were more than happy to put it to its intended use.  The old man had received notice that he and Cadet were entitled to a similar gift, but when he brought it up to Helen, she laughed him off with assurance that the ship didn't need any additional funding to absorb Cadet's scholarship.  For himself, Vincent just decided he'd like to  have the ceremonial stone from the Empress of the Axxaakk Reformation.  Vincent kept thinking about the children's futures as Uuxz came closer, and closer.  He wasn't surprised to see that his former little crew was downright morose as the date loomed ever closer, but Isis-Magdalene had the sense to talk about her departure with them beforehand so that it wouldn't be a shock.  She even tried to spin a positive face on things.

Vincent knew he was going to miss the girl though.  He knew he would regret the missed chance to get to know her parents better too.  Of course, the kids would keep in touch, and he'd see her now and then through that connection, but he expected Marrik-James and Tashmetum-Magdalene would be busy with their own affairs.  Fair enough.  Vincent himself would have a full plate with Cadet for a time yet.  Him, and his budding relationship with Rose.  They'd been stepping out for nearly a month by the time Isis-Magdalene announced her impending departure, and Vincent thought it was going well.  A bright spot to balance, if not darkness, then dimmer shades.  Another bright spot, Rose had found work in one of the kitchens abovedecks, one that focused around Terran ‚Äúcomfort foods.‚Äù  Mainly, that appeared to mean fried foods, but the xenos were infatuated by it by all accounts.  In addition to meeting for morning coffee, and feeding him and Cadet dinner nightly, Rose found times to walk with Vincent during the times when he made himself useful to whoever needed things moved or fetched.  A very good sign, all things considered.  He'd found himself wanting to try for a kiss lately.

As the day of Isis-Magdalene's departure loomed closer, and closer, however, such amorous intentions were left to simmer.  Instead, he focused on Cadet, who was moping about more and more.  His studies were suffering for it, and even the very good simple cooking at Rose's table failed to fully stimulate his appetite.  For most things, Vincent gave the boy his space, and he guessed that in truth he took his troubles to the Chief. However, about five days from the impending departure, when he finally despaired of seeing Cadet do anything other than mope, he said, ‚ÄúSon, what's eating you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what's eating me."" the boy muttered.

‚ÄúSay it anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's not forever, but I'm sad anyway,‚Äù he snapped irritably, ‚Äúand I'm mad about being sad, then I get sad about getting mad!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Vincent sighed, ‚Äúgoodbye sucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Cadet muttered angrily.  After a minute of glowering at nothing in particular, he ventured, ‚ÄúBut we'll still talk.  We'll call.  That makes it better.  A little.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's normal.  You know you'll miss her.  You know you won't see her every day any more.  That makes a difference.‚Äù Vincent explained gruffly.  He tried to make his voice soothing while spoke, and wasn't sure he succeeded.

‚ÄúShe has to go,‚Äù Cadet blurted out, ‚ÄúI wish she didn't but she has to.  She'll be a leader like Jason one day.  Or like Jason's dad.  Just for her people.  So that means she has to go learn how to do it.‚Äù

Vincent ambled over to the sofa where Cadet was huddled in on himself and sat down next to him.  ‚ÄúSo that's it.  The future.  Anybody being officers in any military.  You'll have plenty of time.‚Äù

Cadet hunched his shoulders and Vincent knew he'd struck true.  ‚ÄúI'm in the baby class,‚Äù he muttered darkly, ‚Äúeverybody's gonna leave me behind and go off to do things, and...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're ahead of your age in math.‚Äù  The boy shrugged as if that made no difference, ‚ÄúAnd you're going faster than those kids.  They're not babies, and honestly the standards on this ship are higher than most places.  There's a reason the Chief and Tran stepped up like they did.  You're lucky compared to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù he asked incredulously.

‚ÄúYup.  You have natural talent.  I didn't dare tell you so when we were trying to get home, but you pilot better than most trained adults.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause if I put it in your head that you were too good to get caught, all that talent would go sloppy, and you wouldn't have worked so hard.  You're a natural at piloting, but you're not a bad hand at hard work either.  Just keep on using that talent, and when you see the Little Lady again, you won't feel left behind.  She'll be just as proud to be your friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I see her again,"" Cadet muttered pensively.

‚ÄúSpeaking of friends,‚Äù Vincent rumbled, ‚Äúnormally you'd go to the Chief to get talked out a funk.  What gives?‚Äù

‚ÄúJason's... he's...‚Äù Cadet said fumbling, ‚ÄúSometimes he just stands at a viewport and watches the colors.  Not saying anything or looking at anybody.  He just stands there.  I didn't want to... he's got something on his mind already.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, you could try talking to him like he does for you.‚Äù

Cadet huddled in closer on himself and said, ‚ÄúWhat if I say the wrong thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen he'll tell you so, and you'll grow.‚Äù

They fell into quiet for a time after that, and eventually Vincent prodded him to get back to his reading.  It seemed to help, but Vincent knew better than to see a boy's mood turn around after one conversation.  He did, however make a note to talk with the Chief.  It just so happened that he found a chance to do just that when he went to the dining room for lunch.  The Chief stood in the crew dining room looking out of the enormous viewscreen that took up most of the port wall like it held the secrets of the universe.  The old man stepped up beside the Chief and looked out at the chaotic swirling of the hyperspace sea colliding with the *Among the Star Tides We Sing's* reality bubble.  ‚ÄúChit for a chat,‚Äù Vincent offered.

‚ÄúKeep your chit, chatting's free.‚Äù the Chief softly replied.  ‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou.  Cadet thinks something's bothering you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot bothered, exactly.  Did you know I'm seeing a counselor?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but I could guess your parents would want you to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI picked a door randomly, I got Doctor Elisar.  We get along, I think.  She was SAR Corps.  Voidborn work, not dirtside.  That means ship rescues and station disasters.  Brave, that.  Braver than what I want to do.  Civvies don't get it, they think that facing down the enemy with a weapon is the bravest service there is.  I guess I shouldn't talk like that, since I'm still a civvie too, but there it is.  Trying to pluck the living from the fingers of death in the void itself..."" the boy shivered.  ‚ÄúSAR work only takes the bravest, whether the work's voidborn or dirtside.  At least in the infantry you can shoot the enemy.  She's brave, braver than me, so I can trust her.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ask her about SAR work and get more than you bargained for?‚Äù Vincent asked carefully.

‚ÄúNah.  I knew this about SAR work already.  Kinda.  I saw what it did to uncles and an older cousin.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why the... pensive vigil?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe told me I should stop putting my grief off for later, so I've been thinking about things.  About *The Long Way,* and about the victims, and about Cal.  I think that was good advice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you knew you did the right thing.‚Äù Vincent softly told him, willing the boy to understand.

‚ÄúAye, I know.  It's still a loss.  I never got to meet my cousin.  Would he have been my friend?  Would he have taught me things?  Learned from me?  What could have been?  It's good that I said things for him over his spacer's grave.  I just miss what could have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you you reminded me of him once.‚Äù Vincent said with no less care.

‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was earnest and brave, and a little hotheaded, like you.  He also wanted to make me and his mom proud of him, he wanted to live up to us, like you.  Cal wasn't nearly so disciplined as you are though, I think he'd have taught you how to goof off.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can goof off,‚Äù Jason said defensively with a glance away from the viewscreen, ‚Äúit's just that I'm way behind on studying, and Vai's still stuck in medbay, and Cadet's awful frus-‚Äù

Vincent couldn't help himself, he laughed.  That got an exasperated grunt out of the boy before Vincent said, ‚ÄúThat's what I mean, you don't ever go a minute without thinking about how you can help somebody.  Even the joke you played on me was a way to help.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, so what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you don't really ever goof off,‚Äù Vincent pointed out, ‚ÄúI guess you were born responsible.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing a responsible person is a good thing."" the Chief muttered as he kicked the deck with the toe of a new shoe.

‚ÄúFive days.  How are you holding up?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm regulating,‚Äù the boy said and in answer to Vincent's skeptical look he elaborated, ‚ÄúI'm going to miss her, and I'm not looking forward to farewell, but this isn't the first or last time I've said goodbye to family for a time.  I'll be okay.  Thanks.""

‚ÄúI'm not good at words, Chief, but I had to check.‚Äù

‚ÄúI meant for telling me more about Cal.  Thanks, it helps.‚Äù

Jason waited for Vincent to go off to find more work to do and wondered whether the old man knew he was drawing pay as a shuttle pilot already.  It would be rude to ask.  Maybe the old man just got restless if he wasn't doing something.  If so, Jason could understand that.  He watched the chaos of the hyperspace sea held at bay by the *We Sing's* hyperdrive for a while longer.  He found comfort in their inscrutable beauty.  It was a fine thing to let himself feel the loss, so far as he figured, but dwelling on it was another thing.  He shook himself, snagged a sandwich wrap, and strode to the medbay.  He was pretty sure that Vai was about to be discharged, and he wanted to be there.

Along the way, Trandrai clambered up a ladder and fell into step beside him, and he found himself smiling at the bundle of custom anodized aluminum crutches in various colors.  ‚ÄúFinally coming out of your cave, Tran?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe machine shop is hardly a cave, Jason."" she told him with a roll of her eyes, ‚ÄúI wanted to make them myself.  Vankrai kept trying to take over, so it took way longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's been wanting an apprentice,‚Äù Jason said, ‚Äúand you probably learned some stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe dotes on me too much,‚Äù she shrugged.  ‚ÄúHe's not even in clan Drill.""

‚ÄúBut he's crew.  Besides, that brings the total up to four.‚Äù

‚ÄúTotal of what?‚Äù Trandrai asked, a little startled.

‚ÄúFriends you've made without any help.‚Äù

Trandrai's cheeks flushed lilac as she slowly nodded.  At length she said, ‚ÄúYou sure about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won't really get a chance again for a while.  We won't all be together again for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù

Jason shrugged uncomfortably and asked, ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbovedecks?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll be fine.‚Äù  Trandrai gave him a skeptical look  and he said, ‚ÄúI know folks'll stare.  I figure at least a couple of passengers got aboard to catch a glimpse of a George.  Maybe me, maybe Dad or Papap or Uncle Victor or Nana or any of us.  I can't hide forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look like you did...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a fight,‚Äù Jason interrupted.  ‚ÄúA fight with myself.‚Äù

Trandrai nodded sagely before she mused, ‚ÄúIt might not be such a bad thing to always keep watch.  I'll try to keep an eye out too.‚Äù

‚ÄúTran, you're a gem.‚Äù

‚ÄúHush, you.‚Äù

They reached the medbay, and made sure to keep out of the way and cause no disturbance to the patients.  Jason even didn't laugh at one of the medtechs shouting in exasperation at a particularly stupid injury.  When they slid into Vai's recovery room without incident, they found Isis-Magdalene already waiting for them.  ‚ÄúAre you certain?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúI have found this deck full of its own delight, and I find no need to impose further.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can wait until I'm stronger,‚Äù Vai agreed with her brown eyes full of concern as they fell on Jason.

‚ÄúAye, I'm sure,‚Äù Jason said trying to only let the warmth he felt at their concern touch his voice, and none of the irritation he felt at their coddling.

Isis-Magdalene must have caught some of that, because she said, ‚ÄúI shall be sure to tell you if I find the crowd too distressing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn't Cadet coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess he's probably still working on his homework.‚Äù Jason said easily, ‚ÄúWe can wait on him if he doesn't beat Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought Aunt Brigid wasn't pulling duty while she's on leave.‚Äù Trandrai blurted out.

‚ÄúShe's not,‚Äù Jason snorted with amusement, ‚Äúexcept for overseeing Vai's case.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't you say it!‚Äù Trandrai said with a warning finger waving under Jason's nose.  ‚ÄúI don't wanna hear anything about being in a cave.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn't gonna.‚Äù Jason lied, unable to hide his smirk.  Se scowled at him.  His grin grew.

‚ÄúAh Jason.  Glad you're here,‚Äù Jason flinched at his mother's tone, and when he turned to face her, Brigid wore an expression of implacable certainty, ‚ÄúWe need to pull some samples to clone your eye.‚Äù

Jason thumbed the embroidered Saint Ayden's cross on his eye patch and grumbled, ‚ÄúI could just wait until I'm sixteen and get an aug.""

‚ÄúOr you can stop being stubborn and take a perfectly good eye.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry I'm late,‚Äù Cadet said as he squeezed into the little room, ‚ÄúWhere are your parents and the pups?‚Äù

‚ÄúNap time,‚Äù Vai supplied, ‚ÄúThey figured out that they can't hang out in here all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell Ma, can't have everyone waiting on me!‚Äù Jason exclaimed with a forced grin in the face of her maternal glare.

‚ÄúVai, since your parents aren't here, you're not exactly discharged.  They'll need to sign the discharge for that, but you're free to go anywhere aboard the ship except for engineering and weapons stations.‚Äù

The children lost little time in drawing Vai out of the hospital bed and into a wheelchair so they could speed her away to change into some proper clothes.  ‚ÄúJason,‚Äù came Brigid's call on their heels, ‚Äúdon't think you can just procrastinate for four years!‚Äù

One change of clothes for Vai in the guest quarters where her parents were staying later, and Vai was insisting that Trandrai couldn't go dressed in a greasy jumpsuit.  That led to going to her quarters in the lightworlder section, and the other two girls spending what Jason and Cadet thought to be an inordinately long time picking out something ‚Äúsuitable.""  They threatened to do the same thing to him next, but he flatly refused saying dryly, ‚ÄúI havn't a need to look pretty.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you not?‚Äù Isis-Magdalene asked, and for some reason that earned a laugh from the girls.  Jason exchanged an exasperated look with Cadet.

‚ÄúWhere are we going first?‚Äù Vai asked through her mirth.

Her smile proved infectious, and Jason said, ‚ÄúFirst, ice cream.  All our best stuff is abovedecks, we run luxury passenger liner, after all.‚Äù

And so they went abovedecks into the public areas of the ship, beginning with an ice cream parlor where Isis-Magdalene had her first sundae with xenos-safe chocolate syrup of course, and Vai got the tallest ice cream cone on the menu.  Jason and Trandrai were more realistic with what they ordered, and therefore neither of them suffered brain freeze, and Jason admitted to sometimes visiting the parlor just to watch xenos make exactly that mistake with their first ice cream.  When the two overeager girls realized that they wouldn't be able to finish before it all melted, they allowed themselves to be dragged to the next attraction.  Jason made sure to temper their pace to the arcade where passenger kids shot them dirty looks for using their ship IDs to play games without buying tokens, even though they failed to notice that they never won any tickets.  The guests found delight in the more physical games of Terran origin, ski ball, whack-a-mole, darts, and others.  The video game cabinets were less attractive, and Jason figured that it was probably because they could be played at home just as well.  Before they quite tired of that, Jason pulled them along to a room with a wide stage where Vai and Isis-Magdalene were dazzled by traditional Star Sailor blade dancing.  The two oohed and ahheFhed at the grace with which each of the six men handled their four swords while avoiding dealing each other what would be grievous wounds by fractions of an inch.  Cadet's beak hung open like he'd forgotten to shut it while the audience showered the dancers in approbation.  Again, and again, Jason drew them from entertainment to entertainment, from delight, to delight, until it was time for dinner and the children's return to their quarters for bed.  By point of fact, he'd shown them so much fun that he carried Vai piggy-back while Trandrai fought yawns and carried her crutches. 

Jason did feel the eyes of strangers on him every moment he was abovedecks though, and that itch between his shoulders that warns of danger too.  However, he was able to keep his calm, and when the varied passengers seemed to hide threats, he was able to stop and look, and found no such threats.  He knew that it was an effect of his journey, and he knew that when a knot of ten or so people surged toward him they weren't charging grub victims, but his heart pounded all the same.  It wasn't just too much fun that had him exhausted by the time he'd seen everyone to their doors.  He decided that he would postpone throwing himself into his berth long enough to write his thoughts on the day down in his journal.  Best not to break a good habit.  He was glad he'd done it.

Jason, and he supposed the other children too, quickly fell back into routine.  Studying, exercise, training, and entertainment, even as those things overlapped on account of Helen George's creative use of family retired from services or hired tutors.  He suspected that she was helping Vincent get his qualifications to be a Sergeant in the Mountaineers.  Jason always liked the fact that the Mountaineers ranks were styled off of the E-scale.  Their next foray from the crew quarters deck was of course, the day of departure.  Jason felt glad that he'd made sure that Isis-Magdalene's memories of his home included at least one day of pure fun.  By that day, he found something of a surprise.  Vincent stood in the shuttle bay beside one of the *We Sing's* dozen passenger shuttles looking sharp in a ship's uniform.  It turned out Vincent had learned that he had a job at some point.

The bay was rather crowded, in point of fact.  Iris and Laurence were there as captain and head of the family, respectively, as well as all of their sons and daughters, and their husbands and wives.  Also present were a goodly portion of the men and women Jason had come to know as ‚Äúaunt‚Äù or ‚Äúuncle‚Äù whether they were his great uncles or third cousins twice removed depending on age and role more than the strict nature of their relation.  Of course, anybody with children had brought them along.  It was proper, just like a welcome, a farewell should have as many hearts as can be spared present.  

Iris and Laurence stepped forward arm-in-arm, their gray-haired iron-hard faces softened by fond warmth mingled with sorrow at parting as much a hammer and an anvil can be softened.  They halted before Marrik-James and Tashmetum-Magdalene, and  Iris began, ‚ÄúYou came to the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* as guests on her decks and in our hearts.  The guest-right is fulfilled, for we have reached the place of your choosing.‚Äù  Jason's grandmother reached out and took Marrik-James by his shoulders and kissed his left cheek, then his right.  Then, she repeated the gesture with Tashmetum-Magdalene, but she kissed the top of Isis-Magdalene's head.

‚ÄúYou now depart from our decks but not our hearts,‚Äù Laurence continued, ‚ÄúI now name Vincent Frimas to pilot the shuttle that shall see you to your door.  I now name Jason George, Trandrai Drilldrai, Vai Daughter of Sam Daughter of Eve of Casa Rica on Manatee Paradise, and Cadet Frimas to see you to that door in safety and honor.  As we cannot all go that far, now I say to you farewell.‚Äù

‚ÄúFarewell.‚Äù Jason said, and his small voice was swallowed by the voices of family around him.

When the family fell silent, Laurence repeated his wife's gestures in the same order.  ‚ÄúFarewell,‚Äù Laurence said again before he continued, ‚ÄúMay you chart your course by stars fixed in your hearts.  May your course bring you to our decks again one day.‚Äù

‚ÄúFarewell,‚Äù Jason said with all his kin there, ‚ÄúMay you chart your course by stars fixed in your hearts.  May your course bring you to our decks again one day.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod keep you, and stay strong,‚Äù Iris said, her snapping voice full of warmth. 

Marrik-James leaned down as Isis-Magdalene whispered in his ear.  Then, he said, ‚ÄúFarewell, I leave your ship, and take with me the honor you have shown.  Farewell.‚Äù

Maxwell pushed Jason forward, and Jason shot his father a smile over his shoulder as he trotted forward.  When he got closer, he saw that Isis-Magdalene's cheeks glistened wetly.  Once he reached her he reached out and took her hand whispered, ‚ÄúDon't cry, Isis.  It's not forever, we'll meet again.‚Äù

‚ÄúPart of the ceremony?‚Äù she asked under her breath, ‚ÄúI didn't read the correct response.‚Äù

Vincent watched his former little crew emerge from the crowd of his new family and held back tears.  The Chief strode with confidence and purpose, he could practically see a major general's epaulets on the boy's shoulders.  Trandrai walked with her head held high and her back straight, and Vincent swelled with pride when he recalled the girl who wouldn't quite meet his eyes.  Cadet had his eyes fixed on his adoptive father, and Vincent knew that his son was trying not to let his feathers stand on end from nerves.  Vai came on last, she hardly struggled with her crutches at all.  There already was Isis-Magdalene between her parents, struggling to hold back tears in the face of this magnificent sendoff.  Vincent felt a touch of moisture in his eyes at the realization that this could very well be the last time he'd have all five of them together. 

The aging pilot caught what the Chief whispered to Isis-Magdalene and her question as he reached the shuttle first, and he caught his answer, ‚ÄúNah, that's just between us.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen do I have your oath on it?‚Äù Isis-Magdalene tremulously whispered back.

‚ÄúAye, I promise.  We'll meet again one day.  In person.‚Äù Jason whispered with a grin as she turned with her parents to board the shuttle.

Laurence had explained it to him, so Vincent waited.  He waited for Isis-Magdalene to board the shuttle.  He waited for the other four kids to board.  Lastly, he waited for the family to filter out of the bay.  At last, he boarded the shuttle and cycled its loading hatch closed while his passengers all settled into the first row of seats and strapped themselves in.  He hid a grin at that.  They weren't likely to need the straps unless he decided to put the shuttle through its paces, but the rules were the rules.  When he sat down in the seat he said to Cadet, ‚ÄúYou could sit with the others.  More time before she leaves.‚Äù  The massive door on the starboard wall flickered blue as the atmosphere retaining force field came to life, then began to yawn open to expose the inky blackness of space.

‚ÄúIt's almost like it was.  You and me up here, them back there.  It's the last time it can be like this,‚Äù Cadet said.

‚ÄúThe Last time,‚Äù Vincent agreed as he brought the shuttle up off the deck and guided it into the void.  He banked to port and pitched downward, and the golden orb with space spattering of emerald and sapphire of a primarily desert world filled the viewscreen.  He didn't have anything else to say as he carefully followed the flight plan to the planet's only spaceport where smaller cargo haulers and passenger liners were landed, as well as a number of ships about the size of *The Long Way.*  A great many about her size.  The city surrounding the spaceport was a huddle of square flat-roofed buildings in a sea of sand, but it nevertheless had an air of burgeoning prosperity about it.  Ground vehicles filled the streets, and there were already four arterial highways with companion magrailways snaking out across the desert to other large settlements.  The Reformation had likely chosen the world for one of its best military academies for its harsh environment and lack of comforts, but it looked to Vincent like those circumstances may be altering.  He didn't have any trouble setting down.

When Vincent and Cadet returned to the passenger cabin, he found Isis-Magdalene weeping while holding Trandrai in one arm and Via in the other while the Chief put his arms around them all while the noble poise of Advocate-Lord Marrik-James and Recorder-Lady Tashmetum-Magdalene broke at last.  Tears streamed down Marrik-James's face as he strode forward to extend his hand toward Vincent.  ‚ÄúThis is the way among Terrans, is it not?‚Äù the man blubbered.

Vincent reached out and took his hand saying, ‚ÄúYes. This is how we do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe'll meet again,‚Äù Vai said with the cheer that Vincent thought was inborn in her. ‚ÄúI'll call you as much as you want.‚Äù

Vincent shook the weeping father's hand while Cadet flashed past him and threw his wings over the embracing children.  ‚ÄúI know you have to,‚Äù the boy croaked, ‚Äúbut I wish you weren't going.  I wish you could stay and we could sail together forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe shall always be together,‚Äù Isis-Magdalene sobbed, ‚Äúin our hearts.‚Äù

""*Loved she was for she was one with they,  
Courage she grew though she did not see,  
Farewell they bid for they shall again see her one day,  
Remembered she is and the future she does not flee.*"" Jason recited, and flashed her a grin when she pulled back enough to see it.  ‚ÄúWe can put it off a little longer.  Traditionally, we're supposed to see you to your house.‚Äù

That set off another round of weeping, and Vincent found himself embraced between Marrik-James and Tashmetum-Magdalene, and it was some time before Isis-Magdalene said, ‚ÄúNo.  No, if I pull you beyond this door, I shall try to pull you along until I enroll at the academy.  No.  Farewell is farewell.  May your wells never go dry.‚Äù

It took more hugs and handshakes, and tears before Vincent once again cycled the boarding ramp closed, and he could imagine Isis-Magdalene standing on the landing pad waving as their shuttle dwindled into a speck before it disappeared into the sky of her new world.

1me329m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1me329m/i_miss_caffeinated_teas_so_much/,I miss caffeinated Teas so much,"I am a big tea person. I have lose leaf herbs and this summer I am growing some of my own. Using fresh Basil and hopefully soon spearmint, peppermint, and other herbs. 

However about two years ago I cut out caffeine. I was having heat palpitation issues (I was 30m btw and healthy) and it was adding to my anxiety. 

I have gotten to a place where I don't need caffeine. The first month or so was rough. 

I know there are some decaf options if you hunt for them, but It really is a drag. For one, I'd grow my own tea plants if I could use it. 

Also, when I am at a coffee/tea shop I often am forced to pick something like mint when there might be a lot of other interesting options that contain caffeine. 

I discussed the idea of maybe re-introducing it. Maybe small amounts.. But then I remember how much it sucks to stop and how I don't need it anymore to make it through the day. So if I tried it and it didn't work then I would end up needing to go through caffeine withdrawals all over again. 

Not sure if I'd regret drink tea in very small amounts or not...

1me31ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1me31ak/should_you_try_the_best_over_ear_headphones_tozo/,Should You Try the Best Over Ear Headphones TOZO HA1 for Travel,"I‚Äôve been putting the TOZO HA1 headphones to the test for a couple of weeks now, and they‚Äôve become a part of my daily routine. From hours of podcast binging to gaming marathons, I've truly gotten a deep sense of what this headset can do. While I'm impressed overall, there are still a few aspects that deserve a closer look.

**Design and Comfort**  
One of the standout features of the TOZO HA1 is its design. It's foldable, making it compact enough to toss into my work backpack without it taking up too much space. The foldable joints feel sturdy even after repeated use, which is crucial for daily commuters or travelers like me. The padded ear cups sit snugly around my ears without feeling suffocating‚Äîeven after a long binge-watch session of my favorite series, they didn‚Äôt make me want to tear them off. That said, the size might not fit smaller heads as comfortably, so it's something worth considering.  

**Sound Quality and Customizability**  
The sound delivered by these headphones exceeded my expectations. Thanks to the 40mm composite titanium-plated diaphragm, the high notes and deep bass sounded beautifully crisp. I've used the customizable EQ setting available via the dedicated TOZO app to tweak them for different genres‚Äîswitching between Odyssey‚Äôs ethereal soundtracks and hard rock feels almost magical. I enjoyed being able to toggle between the 32 preset EQ settings directly on the headphones. However, I must admit the low-latency gaming mode didn't blow my mind; while it‚Äôs handy, I experienced occasional latency during more intensive gaming sessions.  

**Battery Life and Versatility**  
Having a 70-hour battery life almost feels like a cheat code in modern audio gear. Using these headphones daily for video calls, workouts, and music sessions, I didn‚Äôt have to charge them for almost an entire week. TOZO claims you can get through 1125 songs on one charge, which doesn‚Äôt seem that far off based on how long they lasted for me. And when the battery did finally die, the 3.5mm detachable cable came to the rescue. The hybrid connection is a huge win for anyone who‚Äôs always on the move.

[Don‚Äôt miss TOZO HA1 deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://audio-play.com/p/b0d925vqvg/)

**Noise Cancelling and Mic Performance**  
The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) technology is great, although it's not at the level of high-end active noise cancellation headphones I've previously tried. In bustling coffee shops, the headphones did a decent job reducing some background noise during calls, which was a lifesaver during remote meetings. My coworkers said I sounded clear on calls, which is always a relief when working remotely. However, in noisier settings like busy train stations, the ENC struggled a little to maintain clarity during conversations.  

**Connectivity and Bluetooth Range**  
The introduction of Bluetooth 5.4 to this set ensures a stable connection, and I rarely faced any dropouts. I even tested it by walking to the other end of my apartment‚Äîabout 20 meters from my device‚Äîand the music didn‚Äôt falter. It pairs seamlessly with both my iPhone and laptop, although switching between devices was not entirely effortless. In some cases, it needed to be disconnected manually from one before pairing with another.  

**Pluses**  
- Exceptional battery life, lasting up to 70 hours.  
- Sound quality with deep bass and crisply distinguished highs.  
- Flexible EQ settings that let you personalize your listening experience.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Noise cancellation isn‚Äôt as effective as premium models.  
- Larger ear cup size may not suit everyone.  
- Occasional latency during gaming mode.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at alternatives, I would say the TOZO HA1 competes well with mid-range headphones like the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 and the JBL Tune 750BTNC. The Soundcore Life Q30 might offer better noise cancellation and a slightly more intuitive app interface, though its battery life falls short compared to the HA1. The TOZO model, however, trumps JBL‚Äôs offering in terms of battery longevity and bluetooth range, though JBL‚Äôs sound profile leans toward a richer tone straight out of the box without much need for customization.

**Price Performance**  
These headphones sit at a sweet spot for the features included. The build quality, battery specs, and sound capabilities are all worthy for this price bracket. Some competitors at a similar price point simply don‚Äôt offer features like customizable EQ or the versatility of Bluetooth 5.4 and wired support. If you‚Äôre someone who values longer battery life and a customizable audio setup, then you‚Äôll find this product worth every penny spent.

The shower is two weeks from now. 

I replied, Congratulations! I think I'll be free that day. Can't wait.  When is your wedding? How exciting.

Her reply: oh the wedding is in (she provided the date) which is two weeks from the wedding shower. You can come to both!
