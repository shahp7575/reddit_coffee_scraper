1h2dcgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1h2dcgm/enamel_removed_when_braces_cement_was_sanded_long/,Enamel removed when braces cement was sanded- long term consequences,"Hello, a family member of mine had braces as a child and several prominent teeth have the enamel removed where the braces cement used to be. I did not ask my relative for a photo of their teeth, but am really concerned as I am a close relative. There doesn't seem to be any bad breath, so I don't think they are cavities now, but there is more staining than the staining from drinking tea/coffee/etc, and only in those areas. I know this person has gone to a dentist in the past \~year, although I cant remember if its been within the last 6 months. 

1. 4-5 top teeth have rectangles on them where the braces cement was sanded and the enamel was also sanded. These regions are brown. The reset of the teeth was fine, and looking in the mouth while my relative was talking (sorry...) the molars looked nice and clean with no other obvious staining. The braces came off several years ago. 

2. prior history of smoking. no current alcohol use. asthma and some psychiatric diagnoses, but which would not really be relevant to this issue. 

3. not my mouth, I don't have photos of these teeth. 

My concern is what will occur in 10+ years. **Does money need to be set aside for these teeth to be replaced?** To me it sounds like there will be cavities on several teeth in the top front of the mouth, on the front of those teeth. **Are cavities likely? How do these teeth need to be cared for in light of this? Why do people get braces, if the sanding damages the enamel?** ",1,1732853379.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I think she might have stumbled upon one of my irl journal entries (thankfully not a too personal one), so that‚Äôs probably why she‚Äôs being nicer. Not only that, but she‚Äôs finally seeing just how much I study. I think we might finally be getting along‚Äî she‚Äôs trying to be better. I‚Äôm really happy.

We‚Äôve been connecting a bit more. I think she‚Äôs finally trusting me, and realizing that I‚Äôm more than just her child‚Äî that I have feelings, interests, and things that make me a *human*. We‚Äôve been having a few conversations before bed. It‚Äôs mostly been about my classes and her job, but I‚Äôve managed to direct some conversations into our interests.

I ended up getting her to start reading again. Her first book is ‚Äú*Before the Coffee Gets Cold*‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a collection of short stories all happening in a certain cafe that allows you to travel through time, but only for a few minutes. It talks a lot about relationships, guilt and loss, but also about growth and understanding. It‚Äôs such a good read in my opinion. I really think my mother will enjoy it.

Yesterday, she also helped me clean and bandage my wounds. She was being really nice about it, being gentle and not judgmental at all. I really appreciated it. It was nice.

I‚Äôm just really glad that my mother and I seem to be connecting again. I really enjoy our moments together, but I can‚Äôt help but feel a bit of dread. There‚Äôs a part of me that worries that all of it was just a farce, and she‚Äôll go back to before. I hate to say that I‚Äôm scared of that possibility. I don‚Äôt want to start caring just for her to start judging me again. I don‚Äôt want to face her arrogance and judgement. It‚Äôs happened multiple times before, and I‚Äôm dreading for it to happen again.

I really wish that she‚Äôs being genuine though. That‚Äôd be really nice. I want to trust her completely, and for her to do the same in return. I hope that she continues to support me, and to make me feel like I‚Äôm human. I really hope that things stay this way. Maybe this time her hugs will feel real, and they‚Äôll stay that way.

It was incredible, but it struck me that every dish from this decidedly global menu was considered traditional to the local culture, yet they all relied on ingredients endemic to the America's.  

The list of roots, fruits, and veggies that originate from the America's crazy; potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, pretty much much all nightshades, cashews, pumpkin, squash, peanuts, pecans, black pinto navy kidney and lima beans, pineapple, guava, strawberries blackberries raspberries cranberries, avocado, quinoa,.... Corn... coffee.... chocolate.  None of these were readily available to Europe, Asia, and Africa before 1500's.   

This leaves me wondering what the heck were people eating before the global profligation of New world crops. There was a dynamic cross-continental trade network for spices, with huge demand and earnings potential. But that makes total sense if you've been doomed by birth to live in a world without tomatoes, peppers and coffee.

Hello all, happy thanksgiving!
I have a relatively small living room space with a beige chaise lounger. I‚Äôm looking to get new coffee table, end table(s), and accent chair. 
- I have been looking at 3 table set options: 2 with a concrete top, and one with a marble top that looks like a close match to marble we have on one wall near the fireplace. 
- considering a blue fabric chair or leather chair for contrast with the lounger 

Leaning toward the marble top tables, due to (1) the match with the marble on the adjacent wall, and (2) the coffee table size is small enough to ‚Äúnest‚Äù next to the lounger as shown in the blue tape perimeter. The concrete top tables are about 4‚Äù wider so would extend slightly past the end of the chaise. 

I figured the blue fabric chair would contrast the beige chaise lounger. Also the smoke colored leather chair would be an option that provides a lot of contrast. 

Attached are (1) photos of the blue fabric and smoke leather chairs I am considering; (2) our living room that shows our beige chaise lounger, as well as the marble on the adjacent wall; (3) the marble-top coffee table and end table set, and (4) the concrete-top coffee table and end table set.

Not to sound like a pick me, but I‚Äôm seriously not like other girls. I‚Äôm very demure and respectful until I have to advocate for myself, even then I still speak with a level head and respect. To try to be a ditz is the hardest thing in the world for me‚Ä¶and yes that makes the guys run for the hills. I‚Äôm also freakishly tall for a young woman and slightly overweight, but I‚Äôm not ugly by any stretch. Just this combination of things scares guys. On top of this, my fear or rejection is a level 0, so like 99.9% of the time I make the first move and I‚Äôve been rejected‚Ä¶EVERY‚Ä¶SINGLE‚Ä¶TIME. Now here‚Äôs where this plays into my story. There is a boy in one of my classes, it‚Äôs more of a work setting than an actual class so we‚Äôre more like co-workers, I‚Äôve had a physical crush on him since the end of my junior year and all summer leading into senior year, knowing he‚Äôd be in my class. We will call him Roger (No real names used in this). So Roger, is a lot like me, he‚Äôs very rooted and calm, he still has his dumb teenage boy-esque behaviors, but once he further matures, he will be an amazing man and make a great husband and father, something my generation lacks. This is a two piece class, I took the first piece of this class a year early due to my knack for the material but took the next year off to take an honors class and came back this year. Unfortunately this has led my social situation to be less than favorable, the whole class had taken the first part together and I‚Äôm just joining all of them. Roger is friends with half the class and basically every girl in the school has a thing for him, so I‚Äôm just a warm body and take up space in the room to him. I‚Äôve tried to break into his giant group talks before, but I basically get pushed to the outside, however, Roger is actually the only one who acknowledges my trying contributions to the conversation and tries to include me, but to no avail. During the conversations, I manage to listen, and the more I hear, the more I fall for this boy. He wants nothing to do with drugs or alcohol and is not lead around by his dick. Roger started dating a girl about a moth into the school year and their relationship ended within weeks due to her wanting a physical relationship and him wanting nothing of the sort. So he‚Äôs the perfect all-American good-boy, and I‚Äôm just head over heals. I‚Äôve had crushes and lusty wants but never this feeling. I love Roger, I love him. I don‚Äôt have a crush anymore, I love him. I feel as though it‚Äôs criminal to have such a strong feeling for someone and not tell them‚Ä¶so I told. A few weeks into the school year, I followed his instagram, he followed me back! I DMed him on there once for the purpose of asking him to be a part of my project (he was all excited to do it, but our schedules didn‚Äôt match) and we‚Äôve liked each other‚Äôs posts. At some point the relationship he was in ended and I knew to cool it for a while, but after like 3 weeks post break up, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I DMed him again, only this time it was to express that I thought that he was mature and we may have a lot in common, I then proceeded to ask if he‚Äôd be up for coffee latter that week. Upon reading it he responded, saying that he had to say no because he was talking to someone new. Roger thanked me for the offer, telling me it was a sweet gesture, I wished him luck with his new relationship and that was that. We still follow each other and we see each other in class and nothing is weird, we‚Äôre acting like adults over it. Yet on my own, there is a serious longing, again, I love him. Roger just doesn‚Äôt know how seriously I feel for him. I know that was long, but it‚Äôs how I feel, and I‚Äôm hurt, he‚Äôs such a sweet angle boy and the girls at my school are absolute sharks who will rip him up, and I just want to love him.

Fast takeaways:
- can't count the small bridges and side roads completely gone. Many temporarily repaired or rebuild pending but so many walking across iron beams as bridges to get out. Bridges are in big cunks like crushed grahm crackers.

- electric lines and some poles are still down like spaghetti strings twisted up. Most every elect pole is new and many old transformers are still on side of roads

- emt delivered food w us and said some found bodies 2 days after only bc of the smell, he was afraid to go into some of the areas for safety and was carrying some heat as was warned meth dens are common

- many tents and campers near old destroyed homes, they get generators and were large tent areas, water tanker trucks still in parking lots

- some complained about FEMA not helping but a lady showed us her new FEMA generator and said their county was given 500, another said the helicopters and ntl guard were everywhere the first 3 weeks w building gear and vehicles,, post office had tents w supplies and a sched, we were told to honk b4 we entered the property area

- in fairness, church groups are carrying the weight for the community, all dominations

- it was a holiday so pretty quiet on the roads, all seemed rested and in good spirits but were concerned as it was the first cold weekend there.  

- New coats. Thick bed blankets and small elect blankets were most popular handouts.  Also flashlights, cheap coffee makers, sweatshirts and houseshoes.

500 full meals, 80 from our car.  Invest in a trip of support by calling a local church. My mens group has taken chainsaw groups up. Some in our area of CLT are boxing new clothes kits.

I‚Äôm torn between following my interest in coffee and customer service or going into a more traditional hotel role, like front desk or receptionist, which seems more aligned with my degree. I feel both lost and confused about my career choices, as I‚Äôve always been someone with a variety of interests and skills, which makes it hard to narrow things down.

Looking forward to your advice, especially those in the same industry as mine. Thank you! ü•π

1h2cya7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1h2cya7/dick_bag_landlord/,Dick Bag Landlord,"     As the title says I‚Äôm dealing with a tool of a landlord. I‚Äôve lived in GA for about 4 years and 1 full lease (12 months)+ about 5 months of it at the duplex I‚Äôm renting with 4 other people. 
     My roommates turned out to be great friends but shitty roommates and the landlord is a real piece of work. 
     After Hurricane Helene we had a tree clip our roof and said tree broke the guard on our A/C unit. While no one was hurt there is now a hole in our roof (not huge but big enough to be a problem) and homemade mulch made in our A/C every time it kicks on. As you might recall Helene passed through late September of 2024. And as I‚Äôm writing this on Thanksgiving of 2024- almost 3 months later- the hole is still there. Along with the hole, Helene leaked rainwater into my room (no other rooms so the roommates don‚Äôt care and are not willing to leave). Since then every time it rains it leaks into my room through the vent and travels across the beam in the ceiling and leaks through the drywall by the door. This traveling has left coffee stain looking water marks on the beams path (which is amazingly where the ceiling fan is mounted as well as lights, yippee). When it rains these stains grow larger and now have the drywall tape pulling away from the rest of the ceiling. (Dip shit painted the whole house with flat paint so I know that happens when exposed to water/humidity). While this is not the only thing Stupid has done it‚Äôs the one making me fear the most for my safety and wellbeing. 
     I have two guinea pigs in that room and a partner. I truly fear the day I leave for work in the rain and come back to 3 dead loved ones crushed under the weight of a wet roof and an incompetent landlord. With this being said- I want out. I cannot deal with the anxiety this has given me and I cannot deal with treating my room with gentleness akin to that of the sistine chapel. He was told about this immediately after the tree falling and put a tarp over it which has since blown far away. He has been notified of the worsening leak 3 times with the promise of, ‚Äúoh my roof guy is busy but he‚Äôs coming‚Äù every time but the last, that one had a time line of, ‚Äúin the week‚Äù. It‚Äôs been over a week and it‚Äôs crickets from him. 
     I‚Äôm done giving 2nd, 3rd, and now 4th chances to a man who on linkedin claims he‚Äôs a professional landlord. 
     Help! 


     ***If more context is needed please comment and I‚Äôll give it, I‚Äôm really desperate here. Thank you for reading!!!

Note: I'm opening the cafe/bar in China where I currently live which is why I'm only doing 5 types of draft and also going for a few draft cocktails. The market here is different, would it have been in the US I would have taken a different route with the drink options. Also that's why there are English spelling errors in the document lol.

Inside space is 2800 sqft (260 sqm) and outside patio is around 1615 sqft (150 sqm).  
  
The designer wants a rounded v-shape bar but I'm worried it's gonna take time to have it made, be quite a bit more expensive and potentially waste cabinet space. I'm going with kegerators since I'm only doing 5 types of draft beer. Also 5 keg cocktails for which I'll need an additional kegerator setup so in total 10 taps. 

Kitchen: I'm doing fairly simple food so I don't need complicated equipment. The size is big enough but I don't know what I think about the shape, especially the sharp corner on the right by the bathrooms.

Due to the patio and surrounding garden making it a great location for daytime operations, I'll be doing coffee and light brunch during the day. The designers idea is to have a separate coffee space rather than having the coffee setup integrated with the bar. Thoughts on this?  

Any type of feedback would be greatly appreciated, thanks friends!

See, this year I've started to appreciate more the art of coffee. My whole life I've drank supermarket coffee with milk, haven't paid much attention to it. So I just use a moka pot at home and literally warm milk on the stove and that's it.

Lately I've started to put more time into it and even made my first barista course last week! I'm fascinated. I guess this backstory is just to say: I don't want supermarket coffee anymore!!!!

From where do you recommend me to start? I don't have a crazy budget so any espresso machine is out of sight at the moment. I guess starting with a grinder makes sense? It's just for one daily cup for me.

I completed my first back in August. I was being VERY disciplined with my 18:6 fasting then and due to the weather being warmer MUCH more active.

I've been consistently gaining weight this past month, honestly this year and I've gotta do another ""factory reset."" My first fast seemed easy, I didn't eat for a little over 42 hours. I felt amazing, I was completely debloated, clear skin, high energy...everything was good.

The problem has been since then I've attempted at least 3-4 times to complete a 36 hour fast and barely made it 18 hours since. My inability to control my late night binge eating has me dreading and tipping the scales again.

I started drinking ALMOST black coffee this past week and that's helped me suppress my appetite throughout the day but what have you done to stick to a longer term fast so that you stay the course and don't break your fast before you need to?
My goal is to intermittent fast daily 18:6 and throw in a 36 hour fast every week. My preference way to burn calories is hiit cardio so, for me alternate day fasting won't work for me long term AND it makes me want to binge since I know I won't be eating for 24+ hours. I have such a scarcity mindset about it.

It‚Äôs a past I hate to address all the details again and again. If you have any questions, please read the original post and the information I provided below.

Evidence of marriage: we have joint account, bought house together (I paid half), shared health insurance and car insurance.

Evidence of abuse: the family court mandated him to a serial domestic violence class for six month. Also, the judge gave me six months protective order that he could not contact me at all.

Helps I had: local shelter had several good advocates. They helped me to file the protective order and went to the public hearing with me.

Other evidence to the court: iPhone records from him yelling and name calling me, threatening me, and asking me to kill myself. His apology letter that proved him ‚Äúexploded‚Äù one night and tried to beat me. 

Best evidence: he confessed to the judge that married women should not go to restaurants, coffee shops, movies theaters and places like supermarkets without husbands‚Äô escort. He literally told the judge ‚Äúit‚Äôs dirty for a married woman to do so‚Äù. (He‚Äôs a medical doctor working in the US; he‚Äôs Christian and the immigrants background as well). 

The worst thing he ever done to me is gaslighting. He kept saying he‚Äôs a medical doctor and only crazy people need to see psychiatrist or therapist. He also emphasized that no one would believe what I said because he‚Äôs a medical doctor. 

The person who gave me the first help was my gynecologist. I went to the clinic for my annual check and got a breakdown when she kindly asked me ‚Äúis there anything else I can do for you?‚Äù. I cried for almost half an hour there. By the time I was only married for five months. (We dated for almost two years before getting married).

Other evidence suggested by my attorney: PTSD evaluation by professionals. I went to that therapist weekly for almost a year after the diagnosis. 

I hope my experience provides some help for people who just started or in the middle of the journey.

PS: in GA, you can record your conversation without telling the other side, which can be used in the court. But the recording is not necessary for USCIS. Actually, it was not recommended by my attorney. ",1,1732850188.0,VAWAAPPLICANTS,0,1.0,False

1h2cgqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1h2cgqj/struggling_with_dates_i_run_out_of_things_to_say/,Struggling with dates: I run out of things to say and don't know how to keep up with others... any advice?,"Hey, everyone! So I'm writing this hoping to get some wisdom and perspective from older dudes about this topic. This year I've had two dates that left me with the same feeling: I freeze when people talk to much on dates and I simply don't know how to handle it or what to say. 

I'll start by describing what happened on the latest date that I just had last week. I started chatting with this guy on one of those apps that we all know, and after two days he asked me if I wanted to meet and grab a coffee with him. He wasn't necessarily attractive, but he seemed polite and attentive during our interactions, plus he's a side, which is something I'm looking for too, so I said ""why not?""

We met at a coffee shop, and the conversation and the interactions started pretty well. We were asking basic questions, sharing experiences and getting to know each other. However, there was point later on in which he basically took over the conversation. He started taking about what he does, his job, and his entire r√©sum√© on a single rant that felt like an eternity. He studied this, he's studying that now, he's writing this, he's done that...I was so overwhelmed by so much information that I simply didn't know what to say or how to intervene. I just sat there, smiled and noded. I knew at that point that, whatever I could say, was not going to be enough for me to keep up with him and all his accomplishments. Then he asked me questions about myself, and when I answered, he quickly made the topic about himself again. 

My body language was very telling that I was uncomfortable. He noticed it, so we asked for the bill and wrapped it up. He offered to pay for my coffee, to which I said: ""no no, thank you. I can pay for my own coffee, but I appreciate it"". It was a shame because the date was going well, but I felt like he wasn't really interested in what I said, or that he wanted to impress me with his career. Oh! And he lied about his age. His profile said he's 36, but he's actually 41. 

The other date I had was pretty similar, with the same results. Needless to say we never saw each other again. I'm not sure if this is the way people interact nowadays or if I'm doing something wrong? For me a conversation involves listening, paying attention and replying. It's a back and forth. If it's one sided, then it becomes a speech or a lecture. 

I can't put all the blame on them, though. Part of it it's my fault too. 

My life is pretty boring. Nothing ever happens to me. I have a job that takes up most of my day, and after that I just work out. My only interactions are at the gym, but it's mainly small talk. Before the pandemic I used to hang out with friends more often, but they've moved on with their lives and just occasionally text each other, but no longer meet in person. I don't have hobbies or special talents. I don't have exciting stories to share, and even if I did, I'm not the type of person to brag about them on a first date. It also takes time for me to build trust with someone, and these things come out naturally over time. I know I have to do something about it because it will be worse when I grow older...

This is where I ask you: 

How do you deal with people who only talk about themselves on dates? 

How do you NOT run out of things to say in any conversation?

How do you make/keep yourself interesting to other people?

I just bought one of these machines and am gloriously out of my depth on how to use it the first time. I get the idea that the ""Machine installation"" instructions should be run every time (except for the bit about draining water which the manual says is only for the ""first use""). My engineering brain says that the risk it averts, that of pressure sucking milk through the steam wand into the boiler, should always be present, not just the first time the machine is used.

Also, am I right to understand that the portafilter should be left in the group head (for 18 - 20 minutes as the manual says) without coffee, but loaded and tamped with ground coffee only after this period of time has elapsed, at which point extraction should immediately begin? Won't, err, the metal filter be inhospitably hot from the time it just spent in the group head? Or is the filter insulated from the heat somehow and it's just the surrounding metal that becomes hot?

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of Overwatch from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

I then began to feel a slight burning in the bottom of my throat along with gurgling and the ""lump"" feeling. Along with this i would notice a slight bitter taste coming up from the bottom of my throat.  I began to realize this is acid reflux. It's been about a week now and the symptoms are still there. The pain is very manageable and not too bad at this point, more uncomfortable than anything. Like I said it's weird because it's not a burning feeling (other than in my throat) but more of a slight pressure pain in my upper abdomen. I did go to the dr and he put me on pantoprazole which i have been taking now for 4 days. When will I begin to feel relief?

My (32M) family usually doesnt do much for thanksgiving, immediate family comes over for a late lunch at my grandparents house, immediate family that has moved away and extended family do their own thing, and we usually have a group call at some point.  But this year, at the last minute behest of my aunt Karen (59F), all my immediate family decided they were going to fly in and we were going to have a grand ole thanksgiving for ages.  Great, fucking great.  

See for the most part i like and get along with my family, i love when we all get together for non somber occasions because its a rarity, even if its exhausting hosting my ass off. But I cannot stand dealing with Karen, shes nosy (literally will sneak off to look through other peoples rooms) nothing is ever good enough for her (especially if im part of it), self centered, demands respect while giving almost none in return, etc, but hides it all behind being ""folksy"".  Somehow this works on most people, including my family because they for the most part, because they genuinely dont think shes a terrible person.  My uncle Mark (63M) has also been madly in love with her for over a decade, so I have eaten shit from her with a smile for over ten years.  Thankfully she does not come to many family events because shes busy traveling for her ""art career"".  

Well, nothing i can do about it.  Thus the day of reckoning arrives, we all pile in to my grandparents house, i busy myself helping with cooking enough food to feed a small nation, while Karen arrives her standard 30 minutes late (Mark arrived on time lol) with some tale that starts with ""OMG yall wont believe what just happened to me"" with her spawn Chase (35M) and his wife Kelly (27F), and kids (Kile 5M and Bryttani 3F, no those are not typos) in tow.  While Karen regales most of my family with her fantastical tale (something to do with an unhoused person having an episode) my aunt Ida (56F) rolls over to the kitchen and tells me she has something to show me. 

Now Ida isnt technically my aunt, shes my aunts sister,, who is very neurodivergent and mildly schizophrenic.  In spite of her challenges in life, shes a sweetheart, but very blunt and to the point (i love this about her), which some people can find off putting, and shes whip smart, and very very very good at finding shit, often time that people would rather keep hidden.  So if Ida says she has something she wants to show me, I'm more than a little curious as to what shes found.  I pull off my apron and follow behind as she rolls down the hall into the guest room to show me her unholy knowledge.  Its Karen's facebook account, her secret one, with her name misspelled in a weird way and her middle initial, has like 25 followers, no security, with her reposting all sorts of vile racist, sexist, bigoted, end of the world shit, and of course, her allegiance to Trump as the Christian messiah .  Going back fucking years.  Holy fuck.  I have proof of how awful she is. Nuclear grade proof. And Ida has screenshots, a literal archive of most of the horrible shit she posted and reposted and commented.  Before i could i figure out what to do with said information, Mark yells down the hall that dinners ready.  

We all get seated, my grandparents wait for the kids to start saying Grace (theyre religious, most of us arent but it makes them happy so we let them do it), Grace is said, we then all go around stating what were thankful for.  Most people keep it short and sweet, ""im thankful for my family"", ""im thankful we can all be here tonight"", ""im thankful for my iphone"" etc, but Karen goes on a little speech about how its time for families to come together and reconcile, in order for good to keep triumphing over evil, with the toothiest grin imaginable.   Shit, not a good sign.  Meanwhile all i can think about is what shes saying now with what shes posting on her secret account and realizing the depths of her depravity.  

Thankfully, dinner starts not long afterwards and her speech is forgotten as people silently devour the food before them. Once the plates are scraped clean some go for seconds, while the under 18's ask to be excused so they dont have to listen ""boomers talking about boring shit"".  They depart to the guest room to watch TV as long as its PG and not brainrot content with at least a few eyerolls.  The rest of us adults are all sitting at the dinner table making small talk in small groups, getting caught up, while I'm handling clean up duty and pie/tea/coffee distribution.  Inevitably, Karen throws some barbs at me as i walk by: 

""you put too much sugar in my coffee!  it tastes nasty"" (i put exactly how much you asked for)

""Dont drop it!"" (really?)

""this pie tastes a little funny, are you sure you baked it right?"" (yup, its the same damn pie ive made every year for the last 15 years)

""I love coming here! its like being at a restaurant, great food, great company, and a mediocre server!"" (the audacity of this bitch)

and more, each time i swallow my venom knowing, and smile, which gets harder each time because i now have a way to punch back.  Of course the more politely i respond to Karens thinly veiled insults the more she feels the need to throw at me.  Since I'm not biting at her barbs she, i guess, decided to change tactics, and starts loudly talking about her sons accomplishments.  Apparently hes been promoted to assistant manager at his union job, and he and his wife are celebrating their anniversary soon.  And apparently every time she talks about this she feels the need to stare into the depths of my soul while I'm chatting with my uncles.  Once again, i ignore her, not gonna bite.  

After a good 10-15 minutes of realizing her tactic isnt working she decides to turn her attention to Ida, whose sitting in a corner doing a sudoku puzzle with my grandparents cats on her lap.  If it wasnt obvious, Ida and Karen do not like each other, and Ida tends to avoid her like the plague as shes rather non confrontational, and Karen, to her credit, usually leaves Ida alone.  But not tonight.  Now i dont know what was said in the beginning, i was in the kitchen loading the dishwasher, but when i reentered the living roomi saw them having an animated conversation away from the rest of the family, and as i walked towards Karen and Ida to defuse i heard the end of Karen saying:

""God what is wrong with you???""

As she leaned down and got into Idas personal space

My grandfather loves Michelle Obamas ""when they go low, we go high"".  Fuck that.  When they go low you hit back as hard as you fucking can.  I can handle shit being flung at me, been dealing with it my entire life, but i will not tolerate people going after those they perceive as weaker than themselves.  

Me: ""shut the fuck up""

Karen ""how DARE you speak to me like that young man!  She being rude. I am TRYING to help your aunt socialize more with family on such a wonderful day.  Were all here and shes sitting the corner by herself.  She can do that any other day!""

Me: ""Bullshit""

Karen: ""Bullshit?!  Where are your manners?!  IF this is how you treat someone whose only trying to help others you shouldnt be here""

Me: ""Help others??? you are one of the most entitled people I have ever fucking met, the only person you help is yourself""

At this point i realized that the entire room has gone silent and the rest of the family is staring at us.  

Karen: ""Do you have any idea how much i help my community as a small business owner???  How many jobs i create, how much i donate to charity, how much i volunteer to help those in need.  If you cant see how much Ive helped you and everyone else in this room, you are truly lost.  I have and always will continue to do the Lords work, but theres only so many false accusations a person can take""

Me: "".........""

Karen: ""Please, do yourself a favor, and apologize, its clear that you have fallen down a dark path, take your first steps back into the light""

Me: ""Funny, cuz your facebook account doesnt look like someone whose particularly charitable""

Karen: ""See?  more false accusations, its a shame to see a young man with such potential continue to lie through his teeth""

Me: ""Your secret one, not normal one""

Karen ""How ridiculous are your lies going to get?""

Ida decided to chime in here: ""Its Karen, K a a r i n n D Entitled, on NOV 23rd you posted ""i cant wait for all those dirty fucking illegals to be deported back to their shithole countries.  Rip out the bloodsucking parasites!""

""On NOV 21st you reposted ""Grab her by the pussy?  you wish!""

""On NOV 14th you posted ""No more male rapists in the womens bathrooms!  The violent lefts war on women will not be tolerated!""""

""On NOV 6th you poste ""YES!!! Good will always triumph over evil.  'those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.' Job 4:8""""

like some sort of racists destroying supercomputer Ida continued to, from memory, repeat back all sorts of bigoted posts Karen had made or reposted, as the rest of the family pulled out their phones to check if what Ida said was the truth.  You could see on peoples faces first confusion, then disgust as they realized what kind of monster Karen had been hiding underneath.   Karen stood there completely frozen, all the color had gone from her usually rosy face.  And then She. Lost. It.  

Started screaming at us about we were a bunch of heathen liberals who God, by his instrument Trump, would cleanse in the reckoning that would soon come.  How she had been trying to help use ""see the light"" and since Trump won it was time for us to abandon our sicked sinful ways and repent to the Lord.  How she cant stand that my sister lets her daughter fornicate with women.  How we are effectively a bunch of worthless peasants she has taken pity on and how grateful we should be that she dares grace us with her presence.

At this point i pour more gasoline on the fire and said that Trump has more in common with the Anti-Christ than Christ and Karen started screaming at me calling me a direct agent of Satan (what a compliment!).  My Grandfather, Bill (88M) stepped in at this point, and shouted ""ENOUGH"", told me to leave, now, before i did more damage to this family.  

So i left, with a room of stunned family members behind me.  i made a quick goodbye to my nieces and nephews, who were extremely confused why i was leaving early and busy watching TV.  Now Im home and phone is blowing up from family members who attended, family who didnt and heard second hand, and even friends who heard about it through the grapevine.  And realizing that i may have completely destroyed my relationships with my family.

Crypto isn't just a currency‚Äîit's an *experience*. One day you're sipping coffee, casually watching your portfolio grow, and the next you're questioning your life choices because a meme coin just outperformed your carefully researched investment.

**Why we love it:**  
‚úÖ Decentralization vibes üåê  
‚úÖ It's the Wild West of finance ü§†  
‚úÖ Everyone loves a good ""when moon?"" joke üåï

But let‚Äôs get real for a sec‚Äîcrypto is more than just trading. It's revolutionizing how we think about money, ownership, and even identity (shoutout to NFTs and DeFi). Sure, there are risks, but isn‚Äôt that part of the fun? üòè

**Pro Tips for Survival in the Crypto Jungle:**

1. DYOR = *Do Your Own Research*. Don't just YOLO.
2. HODL your emotions. FOMO and panic-selling are your enemies.
3. Remember: Every ""to the moon"" story has a ""re-entry to Earth"" moment. üåç

So, whether you‚Äôre a whale, a shrimp, or just here for the memes, let's keep riding this wave of innovation. After all, the future is decentralized, and we're just getting started. üöÄ‚ú®

1h2bmck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1h2bmck/ezekiel_the_turkey/,"Ezekiel, The Turkey","The chill from outside has infiltrated your bedroom by the time you sit up in bed. The first thing you do is climb out from beneath the covers, leaving them in a disheveled heap, and shuffle to the kitchen. You start brewing a single-serving pumpkin-spiced cappuccino pod in your coffee maker before heading back to the bedroom to pull on your favorite sweater. It‚Äôs old, oversized, and its frayed cuffs brush softly against your wrists.

Cradling your steaming cappuccino, you step outside. Your boots crunch softly against the lightly ice-kissed porch. The first frost of the season glimmers faintly on the grass like the shattered glass of broken tears‚Äîsilvering the edges of scattered leaves and lending the yard an almost magical stillness.

You take a sip, savoring the warmth, and lean against the porch railing. It‚Äôs quiet, the kind of morning that feels untouched by time‚Äîuntil you spot it.

The turkey stands at the far edge of the yard, its dark, hulking form is outlined by the weak morning sun. It stares back at you. It doesn‚Äôt move, doesn‚Äôt blink, only stares. For a moment, your eyes are locked with its tiny black ones, and then, on a whim, you call out:

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

The turkey‚Äôs head jerks up, but it isn‚Äôt startled. Oddly, it seems to crane its neck toward you, as if it‚Äôs listening. Without missing a beat, you pitch your voice into a high, cracking falsetto, the way some people give voices to their dogs:

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù you reply for it.

You grin, rolling with the lines: ‚ÄúGuess what?!‚Äù

In that same, exaggerated voice, you answer for it: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really wanna know?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesss!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù You tell the bird.

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù It replies.

‚ÄúNo, fuck you!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?!‚Äù you imagine the turkey asking.

‚ÄúTony!‚Äù you call back.

‚ÄúFuck you, Tony!‚Äù

‚Äú*Fuck you!*‚Äù You respond, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs *your name?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúEzekiel!‚Äù

You squint at the bird, your grin widening as you hold back a laugh at how stupid you‚Äôre being, doing this on a Tuesday morning in your yard at the edge of the forest. ‚ÄúEzekiel?! That name fuckin‚Äô *sucks!‚Äù*

The turkey doesn‚Äôt flinch. It doesn‚Äôt react at all, and somehow that makes the whole thing funnier. You‚Äôre still laughing when a second turkey ambles out from behind the oak tree‚Äîthis one smaller and scruffier. It immediately starts pecking at the frosted grass like it‚Äôs on a mission.

‚ÄúOh great,‚Äù you say, gesturing with your coffee mug. ‚ÄúEzekiel brought backup.‚Äù

The smaller turkey ignores you entirely, too busy tearing into the ground, but Ezekiel stays still. His head is still tilted toward you, ever so slightly, his black eyes locked on yours from a hundred yards away.

You take another sip of your cappuccino, still grinning. ‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel. Let‚Äôs see what you and your sidekick think of birdseed.‚Äù

You head to the steel feed barrel where you keep seed for the bird feeders. There‚Äôs been little point in refilling them these past two weeks, as the cold has driven most of the birds south. Scooping out a heaping helping of seed, you set your coffee on the porch handrail and step cautiously into the yard.

As you approach, the birds begin to retreat. The smaller one turns its back completely, sprinting into the dense underbrush, but Ezekiel backs away slowly, his beady eyes never leaving you. When you reach the spot where he first stood, you spread the seed on the ground for him and his scruffy friend.

Walking back toward the house, you hear your phone ringing from the counter in the kitchen. Scratching at the stubble on your chin, you grab your coffee from the railing and slide the kitchen door open, stepping inside.

The warmth of the house greets you as you cross the linoleum, careful not to spill your cappuccino as you move quickly to the counter. Your phone sits where you left it, ringing insistently, the screen lighting up with a name you haven‚Äôt seen in quite some time: *Mom.*

You sigh, swiping the screen to deny the call. The ringtone cuts off, but before you can set the phone down, the voicemail notification pings. You hesitate, staring at it for a moment before pressing play.

Her voice is the same as always‚Äîcalm, clipped, careful. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she begins, but then pauses. The silence stretches long enough for you to pull the phone from your ear and glance at the screen to check if the call has ended. It hasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúListen. It‚Äôs been years since you‚Äôve come home for Thanksgiving, Tonya, and‚Äî‚Äù

Your jaw tightens, and you don‚Äôt let her finish. With irritation curling hot in your chest, you press 7, deleting the message mid-sentence. Setting the phone back on the counter, you shake your head and mutter, ‚ÄúEven Ezekiel wouldn‚Äôt have started the message like that, Mom, and he‚Äôs a fucking turkey that doesn‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

The thought almost makes you laugh, but the edge lingers. You take another sip of coffee, exhaling sharply through your nose as you look out the kitchen window.

Neither turkey has returned to the yard, but you see Ezekiel standing at the edge of the forest, still watching.

‚ÄúStrange fuckin‚Äô bird,‚Äù you mutter.

\------------------------------------

By lunchtime, the sun has risen higher, melting just enough of the morning‚Äôs jagged, icy sheen to blunt the sharp, shattered edges of the yard‚Äôs glass-like surface. The thaw hasn‚Äôt softened it entirely; the grass still glints with reflective fractures, catching the light like fresh cracks spreading through a brittle mirror.

You toss together a quick sandwich‚Äîpeanut butter and banana on slightly stale bread, because the thought of braving Rife‚Äôs Market in the center of Bradenville today feels like a battle not worth fighting‚Äîand step outside with it in hand.

Ezekiel is still there.

He stands near the edge of the yard. Before you came outside, he was strutting and pecking at the ground, but now that you‚Äôve settled into your chair, balancing the plate on your knee, he‚Äôs gone completely still. His head tilts ever so slightly, as though he‚Äôs listening to something only he can hear.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre persistent, I‚Äôll give you that,‚Äù you say, taking a bite of your sandwich. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs what I like about you. You stick around. Don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks.‚Äù

You laugh softly to yourself, brushing crumbs off your lap, ‚ÄúNot like Patty Filmore at the grocery store the week before last. She was going on about how Deke Coffee up the road has some kind of glowing-blue-eyed kid with a squid in its mouth locked in his basement. Can you believe that? A watery-blue-eyed child. With a squid. In its mouth.‚Äù

You pause, staring out at Ezekiel as if he might offer some kind of insight, but he just stands there, still as ever, with his beady black eyes locked onto yours.

‚ÄúI mean, she said it had a beak inside its throat and everything,‚Äù you continue, grinning. ‚ÄúClaimed it clicked when the kid talked. Imagine that, Ezekiel. Little squid beak clicks every time it says something. ‚ÄòHi! My name‚Äôs Squid Kid, nice to meet you,‚Äô click-click-click. What the hell‚Äôs wrong with this town?‚Äù

You pitch your voice higher, giving Ezekiel his personality again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Tony. I think Patty‚Äôs onto something. Maybe you should check it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure,‚Äù you reply, rolling your eyes as if the conversation were real. ‚Äú‚ÄòScuse me, Mr. Deke. Hi, sorry‚Ä¶ just wondering if you‚Äôve got some kind of cephalopod child down there in your basement? Heard you did.‚Äô That won‚Äôt get me banned from another town meeting or anything. Bad enough Pastor Thomas‚Äôs wife runs all of them.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù you add, finishing your sandwich, ‚Äúeven if there was some creepy squid kid in Deke Coffee‚Äôs basement, he‚Äôd be more apt to shoot me with his shotgun than invite me inside to see it. I‚Äôm kind of the pariah around here currently. Not exactly neighbor of the year.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, narrowing your eyes thoughtfully. ‚ÄúBut you?! You‚Äôve got that whole enigmatic, loner vibe going. Maybe he‚Äôd let you inside. Give you the VIP tour.‚Äù

In your imagined falsetto, Ezekiel replies: ‚ÄúTony, I‚Äôm just a turkey. We‚Äôre not really into squid kids.‚Äù

That makes you laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, fine. Fair point.‚Äù

Satisfied with the conversation, you stand and stretch, brushing crumbs off your jeans. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move as you go back inside, closing the kitchen door firmly behind you.

\------------------------------------

Your office is just down the hall, the glow of the computer monitor greeting you as you settle into your desk chair. Logging in, you glance at the list of emails waiting in your inbox. The day‚Äôs tasks loom large, but it‚Äôs your last workday before the long weekend, and you‚Äôre determined to finish everything.

The first email is straightforward, the kind of quick reply that makes you feel productive. The second is a little more complicated, and you lose yourself in the rhythm of typing, tweaking, and sending.

But every so often, your eyes drift to the office window.

Ezekiel is still there.

He doesn‚Äôt pace or wander like other birds. He doesn‚Äôt peck at the ground or strut about. Not anymore. He just‚Ä¶stands. Watching.

At first, you shrug it off, muttering, ‚ÄúWeirdo.‚Äù But by the fifth glance, it‚Äôs harder to ignore the tension curling in your stomach. He hasn‚Äôt moved. Not an inch.

The minutes drag on, and the weight of his stare presses on you like an invisible hand, heavy and persistent. By late afternoon, the sight of him has gone from amusing to unsettling.

When the sun begins its slow descent and shadows stretch long across the yard, you decide to logout for the day. Everything else can wait until next Monday. You head outside to bring in the empty trash can from the curb, glancing nervously toward the woods. The yard is quiet, almost too quiet. You half-expect to see him there, standing in the same spot, but it‚Äôs empty now‚Äîthe edge of the forest cloaked in shadows.

You exhale slowly, trying to shake off the unease. It‚Äôs just a turkey, you remind yourself. A weird turkey, sure, but a turkey nonetheless.

Still, when you step back inside, you make a point of locking the kitchen door behind you. The sound of the bolt sliding into place feels louder than it should, echoing in the stillness of the house.

You glance out the window one last time, but the yard is empty. 

Or at least, it looks empty.

\------------------------------------

Wednesday morning greets you with the kind of chill that sneaks into your bones before you‚Äôve even had your first cup of coffee. Pulling your sweater over your head, you step onto the porch, warm drink in hand, and pause mid-sip.

Ezekiel is there.

He stands in nearly the same spot as yesterday, closer to the house this time, his dark shape distinct against the muted backdrop of the waking woods. His outline looks sharper in the morning light, every ridge of his feathers catching faint shadows, giving his form an almost jagged appearance. His head tilts slightly, a deliberate, inquisitive motion, as though he‚Äôs greeting you‚Äîor sizing you up. You sigh, rolling your eyes. ‚ÄúMorning, Ezekiel.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt respond, of course, but you don‚Äôt need him to. You take another sip and lean against the railing, letting the steam from your mug rise to warm your face.

‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about Peony last night,‚Äù you say, your voice soft and distant, like you‚Äôre talking more to yourself than him. ‚ÄúPeony McIntyre. We went to school together. She always had these little yellow ribbons tied into her hair. They were bright, like sunlight.‚Äù You pause, rubbing the back of your neck. ‚ÄúI had the biggest crush on her. Never said a word about it, of course. Why would I? Just got to watch her from a distance, all perfect and glowing like she belonged in some storybook.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, his beady black eyes still locked on yours. ‚ÄúGuess that makes me the fool, huh? Standing around pining after someone who never even looked my way. Ah well, doesn‚Äôt matter now.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúYou got a girl from a storybook, dumb bird?‚Äù 

In the bird‚Äôs voice, you respond: ‚ÄúStorybook? Yellow ribbons I understand, but storybooks? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNevermind,‚Äù you tell him, shaking your head at the ridiculousness of what you‚Äôre doing. Straightening up, you shout: ‚ÄúAlright, wish me luck, Ezekiel. Gotta go into town, pick up some supplies, and avoid anyone who‚Äôs gonna make a scene. You know how it is‚Äîalways someone with something to say.‚Äù

\------------------------------------

The drive into Bradenville is uneventful, save for the rumble of your old Chevy truck on the road. The heater wheezes faintly as it fights to warm the cabin, and the radio crackles with static. You‚Äôre grateful for the quiet, though. It gives you a moment to steel yourself for any potential encounters.

At Tractor Supply, the air smells of feed and motor oil, the faint twang of something sang by Lee Ann Womack is playing over the speakers. You head straight for the feed aisle, scanning the neatly stacked bags until you find the one you‚Äôre looking for: a 25-pound bag of turkey meal, forest green with cheerful photos of turkeys printed across the front. Hefting it onto your shoulder, you carry it to the register.

As you punch your PIN into the keypad, you hear her voice.

‚ÄúTon‚ÄîI mean, Tony. Tony! Oh my sweet goodness, I thought that was you. My, do you look different.‚Äù

You glance up to see Mrs. Thomas, the pastor‚Äôs wife, standing behind you, her hands clasped tightly over her purse, her smile just a little too forced.

‚ÄúHello, Mrs. Thomas,‚Äù you say evenly, focusing on the screen.

‚ÄúYour momma told me she‚Äôs been trying to reach you, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMy ‚Äòmomma,‚Äô‚Äù you interrupt, keeping your tone calm but firm, ‚Äúknows what needs to be done if she wants to mend things. That‚Äôs between her and me. And frankly, Mrs. Thomas, I think you know as well as I do that pretending to respect me isn‚Äôt the same as actually doing it. Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a lot to get done today.‚Äù

Mrs. Thomas blinks, her smile faltering for just a moment before it snaps back into place. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she says, her voice tight, ‚Äúyou have a Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù you reply curtly, taking your receipt and bag.

Outside, the cold air bites at your face as you toss the bag into the bed of your truck. Climbing into the driver‚Äôs seat, you mutter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this for you, Ezekiel. Hope you appreciate the gesture.‚Äù

\------------------------------------

By the time you get home, the sun is already dipping low, its light golden and soft against the trees. Ezekiel is still in the yard, standing exactly where you left him that morning.

*‚ÄúSo fuckin‚Äô odd, this bird.‚Äù* You mutter to yourself, slamming the truck‚Äôs stubborn rusty-hinged door.

You haul the heavy bag inside, setting it on the kitchen island before stepping out and grabbing the scoop of birdseed you keep in the bin for the feeders. Stepping cautiously out into the yard, you approach him.

This time, Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt back away. He watches you intently, his head cocked, his stillness unnerving. You stop a few feet away, bending down to spread the seed across the ground in front of him.

‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù you say softly. ‚ÄúUmm‚Äîsomething to tide you over until tomorrow, I guess...‚Äù

His eyes never leave yours, their black, glossy surface unreadable.

You straighten, the hair on the back of your neck prickling as you take a step back. Then another. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt eat.

‚ÄúGoodnight, then, you freaky fucker.‚Äù

Back inside, you lock the kitchen door, twisting the deadbolt with more force than necessary. Leaning against the counter, you rub at your arms, trying to shake the lingering unease.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not friendly,‚Äù you murmur to yourself. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not menacing, either. Just‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a weird turkey. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

\------------------------------------

It‚Äôs sometime after three in the morning when you find yourself curiously staring out from your bedroom window. The yard is bathed in pale moonlight, the frost glittering like shards of glass on the grass below. At first, the scene feels serene, even beautiful. But then you see him.

Ezekiel stands alone, in his usual spot.

He is a lone shadow perched unnaturally still in the center of the backyard, his silhouette sharp yet distorted in the faint silver glow. His body seems too large for a turkey, the curve of his back arched high, his head angled unnervingly low, like a predator lying in wait. The feathers along his wings and back gleam faintly, catching the moonlight in thin, metallic slivers, as though the bird were made of something far denser than flesh and bone.

Something feels‚Ä¶ off. What is that strange shimmer around his edges, as though he isn‚Äôt entirely solid? You rub your eyes, but the shimmer doesn‚Äôt go away.

Then he moves.

No‚Äînot moves. He *ripples.*

And it begins.

At first, it‚Äôs just a faint quiver in his chest, like a bird shaking off water. But the trembling grows more violent, the body contorting unnaturally. And then, without a sound, he *tears* in two.

A second turkey emerges, identical to the first. The process is smooth, disturbingly clean, like the turkey is replicating itself cell by cell. A shudder runs down your spine as you remember those old high-school biology videos of mitosis, where a single cell splits in two. Only this time, the single cell is a fully-formed turkey, and it isn‚Äôt stopping.

The two turkeys ripple and divide into four. The four become eight. The eight become sixteen. The multiplication accelerates until the yard is overrun, a heaving, pulsating mass of identical birds. They‚Äôre all smaller than he is at first, their forms shimmering and flickering, as if they aren‚Äôt entirely solid‚Äîthen they grow slowly larger to match his size and become opaque, and then they split. They split. And they split. 

And split again.

Each one stares directly at your window. Their eyes glow like gas stove flames, blue and quavering, flickering faintly in the darkness.

You try to back away, but your legs refuse to move. The turkeys continue to split, each one an exact replica, their beaks sharp and glinting in the moonlight. The yard is no longer visible‚Äîjust an endless sea of multiplying bodies, their rippling forms shimmering grotesquely as they grow in number.

Then Ezekiel, the *original* Ezekiel, looks at you.

But they‚Äôre all the same bird‚Äîcopies. *They‚Äôre all Ezekiel,* you realize.

And Ezekiel steps forward.

He moves unnaturally smoothly, as though gliding rather than walking, and the others follow in perfect synchronization. They reach the base of the house and begin to climb, their claws scraping against the siding. You can hear them now, a relentless scratching that grows louder and louder, drowning out your breathless gasps.

One of them reaches the window. Is it the *original* Ezekiel or a copy? You can‚Äôt be sure. Does it matter? Its glowing blue, burning eyes are inches from yours, staring into you. Its beak taps the glass once. Twice as if trying to break through. The glass seems to flex with each peck‚Ä¶

And then it lunges‚Äî

\------------------------------------

You gasp and sit bolt upright, your chest heaving. But you‚Äôre not in bed‚Äîyou‚Äôre on the floor next to the window. Your right hand is gripping the sill so tightly your knuckles ache. The morning sun streams through the glass, warm and golden, erasing the nightmare‚Äôs suffocating shadows. The yard is empty, blanketed in frost and light.

You let out a shaky laugh, the tension in your chest unraveling all at once. ‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù you mutter, rubbing your temples with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúPull yourself together.‚Äù

Then a shadow moves across the window, just below the frame.

You freeze. Slowly, you lean closer, and a head rises into view.

Ezekiel.

Its black eyes lock onto yours, its head tilting the way it always does. You yelp, a sharp bark of fear that quickly melts into nervous laughter. ‚ÄúDamn it, dude, you scared me!‚Äù you say, pressing a hand to your chest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early. Couldn‚Äôt wait for your seed, huh? I uh‚ÄîI got something else for you today‚Äîsomething, uh‚Äîsomething better? I think.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink. He just stares, and for a fleeting moment, you could swear he‚Äôs smiling.

\------------------------------------

You step outside, the cool air brushing against your face, and heft the bag of feed from the kitchen island onto your shoulder. The weight settles awkwardly, but manageable, as you move toward the porch. Ezekiel‚Äôs dark form is already waiting in the yard, his stillness more expectant than before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one demanding bird, you know that?‚Äù you say, your voice light with a chuckle as you descend the porch steps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your Thanksgiving dinner right here, buddy.‚Äù

As you make your way toward him, Ezekiel moves‚Äîsomething he hasn‚Äôt done in days. He steps back, just one step at first, his head tilting sharply toward the woods. You pause mid-step, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this, huh? You‚Äôre not getting cold feet now, are you?‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond, of course. Instead, he backs away further, the motion deliberate, his eyes locked on you as if beckoning. Then, with startling speed, he turns and rushes toward the tree line. He doesn‚Äôt disappear completely‚Äîjust enough to be swallowed by the dense undergrowth, where he pauses, his head snapping back to look at you.

You hesitate, shifting the weight of the bag on your shoulder. ‚ÄúYou want me to follow you?‚Äù you mutter, half to yourself.

Ezekiel jerks his head forward, urging you on.

Something tugs at you‚Äîcuriosity, maybe, or something deeper and more instinctual. You step cautiously toward the woods. The branches sway slightly in the faint breeze, and they brush against your sweater as you push through them, grabbing at you like dozens of skeletal hands. The forest smells damp, earthy, and faintly of petrichor‚Äîthe morning's frosty dew soaked into the soil. Patches of light filter through the tangled canopy, casting patterns on the ground that shift like the reflections from a broken mirror, high in the sky.

‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel,‚Äù you call, your voice muffled by the trees. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading me to your weird turkey cult or something, I‚Äôm gonna be real upset‚Äîprobably.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt stop, darting between the trees with an unnerving ease. You try to keep up, your boots crunching over brittle twigs and dead leaves, the occasional vine tugging at your ankle. The air feels heavier the further you go, like the weight of the forest itself is pressing down on you. Sunlight grows scarce, swallowed by the towering pines and gnarled oaks. Their branches are interlocking like the ribs of a great beast, still sleeping this early in the morning.

Then you see it.

A clearing opens before you, bathed in pale, golden light. The trees around it stand unnaturally still, their rough trunks covered in patches of something dark and oily, gleaming faintly in the sun. The ground here is strangely bare‚Äîno leaves, no grass‚Äîjust smooth, dark soil that looks as though it‚Äôs been tilled by unseen hands. Ezekiel stands at the center with his friend from the other morning pecking the ground behind him. Ezekiel himself is motionless‚Ä¶his form sharp and imposing against the eerie stillness.

You step forward, the bag of feed shifting awkwardly as you cross the threshold into the clearing. Something about the air here feels alive, charged with a quiet energy that makes your skin prickle. You set the bag down and kneel, fumbling with the corner to tear it open. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúAh. I see. Brought me to your friend,‚Äù you say, forcing a laugh to steady your nerves. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre both hungry. Got enough here for plenty‚Äîmore than just the two of you, but it‚Äôs all yours, I guess.‚Äù

As you pour the feed onto the ground, the sound seems unnaturally loud in the silence. You glance up at Ezekiel, expecting him to move, to peck at the dried, ground cornmeal, but he remains perfectly still. His head tilts ever so slightly, his black eyes boring into yours.

You step back, brushing your hands off on your jeans. ‚ÄúI hope you guys like it,‚Äù you say, smiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to give back sometimes, you know?‚Äù

The turkey tilts its head. It seems to rise up onto its talons, growing taller‚Äîbigger‚Äîuntil its beady black eyes are level with yours.

For the first time, it speaks‚Äînot the friendly, imagined voice you‚Äôve been projecting onto it for days, but something low, guttural, and undeniably real.

‚ÄúHush,‚Äù it says.

*‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù* you exclaim in terror. ‚Äú*You‚Äîyou don‚Äôt talk! You say ‚Äògobble gobble!‚Äô‚Äù*

‚ÄúGobble gobble?‚Äù Ezekiel scoffs. *‚ÄúWhat kind of stereotypical?‚Äîforget it.* You know what? Shut the fuck up. Do that. My family and I prefer our meals quiet. Can you manage that? Can you shut the fuck up? You talk so fuckin‚Äô much.‚Äù

A rustling rises from the woods. You turn, just in time to see them‚Äîthe turkeys, dozens of them, their shadows swarming closer. They emerge from the trees with synchronized precision, their bodies glinting faintly in the shifting light.

You don‚Äôt even have time to scream before the first beak strikes, sharp and relentless, puncturing your eye with a wet crunch. Pain blinds you as another tears into your cheek, then your throat, the frenzy consuming you piece by piece and the sounds of the world fade to silence as your vision goes dark.

i sat down in her office to ask if i'm doing anything wrong. the entire conversation seemed like she picked at the smallest things. she told me how these two specific coworkers (yes, she said their names) were complaining about me, i asked what the complaints were. one of them was that, ""i saw you walk into work one day, and noticed you didn't say good morning to (coworkers name). that was very rude of you."" i always say good morning to everyone and ask how they are, but one day was a big deal to her. i told her that was just a mistake and that i didn't see him. it wasn't intentional at all, i just literally did not see him when i walked into work.  
  
 i asked what the other coworker was complaining about and she was smiling like a bully and said, ""well... it's just, your face."" i had no words and was so so confused. i was like, ""my face?"" which was offensive to me as an asian woman who grew up being bullied. then i noticed she paused and you can see that she regret saying it, then was like, ""actually, wait, i don't think he said exactly that."" and laughed it off. i was so confused but upset. like my stomach was turning. i started to tear up and straight up cry. i told her, ""everyone else in the building says i've been doing a good job, and that i look brighter lately."" then she was like, ""well are they the manager? of course they're not gonna tell you what i tell you. some people are two-faced. that's the real world. you're still young, but when you're older and get married and have kids, you'll know."" i just kept crying and after that she said, ""look, all you need to do is smile a lot more."" i was just silent, then said ""alright. thank you."" and just got up and silently left the room.

it hurts till this day what she said to me. especially because we work at an office and i'm always trying to keep the workplace a positive environment and keeping in touch with all my coworkers, even buying them lunch and coffee every now and then. but those words, ""your face"" as a complaint was so so hurtful. i can't look at myself the same without feeling insecure and trying to figure out what's wrong. we don't have a hr department, she's the office manager. i want to send a complaint, but not exactly sure how. i just don't want her to get away with what she said. i don't even know if it's discrimination overall",5,1732847156.0,careeradvice,12,0.86,False

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of Overwatch from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

It all started incredibly well in 2023. Our first date. I (22) was completely smitten; he (26) was the most handsome man I had ever seen. My heart was racing, and I enjoyed every second of that date. More dates followed. We traveled south together and visited romantic cities, lakes, and the sea. Unfortunately, out of nowhere, my depression hit me hard during this dreamlike vacation. Overwhelmed by my emotions, I suddenly became emotionally numb. I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. I told him this with a heavy heart. 

I took time for myself to heal. He was heartbroken but stayed friends with me, and we even did some cool activities together. Slowly, I started feeling better. And suddenly, it was back‚Äîthat feeling of being in love. I asked him if we could try again. He hesitated, but shortly after, it was clear: we became a couple in March. 

We had beautiful dates, shared evenings, and went out for dinner. He surprised me with a trip to a gorgeous mountain lake. But something was missing, and I didn‚Äôt want to admit it at first: in the 615 days (As of today, more to come later.) we‚Äôve known each other, he has initiated sex only 2 or 3 times on his own. I was always the one to initiate it‚Äîalways. Slowly and cautiously, never too much, just once a week at most, and never putting pressure on him. 

But eventually, even that was systematically rejected by him. He always says he‚Äôs tired. Recently, out of the last 20 times I‚Äôve asked, he‚Äôs said no about 15 times. So, only once out of four does he say yes‚Äîand it‚Äôs happening less and less often, sometimes only every two or three weeks. I can‚Äôt do this. Before him, I used to have sex at least once a week, sometimes more. He‚Äôs my first serious relationship, and I love him. He listens to me attentively, supports me with even the wildest projects, checks in on me regularly, and buys groceries for me without me asking when I don‚Äôt have time to shop. 

But otherwise, he doesn‚Äôt initiate anything. If I don‚Äôt talk on the phone, there‚Äôs silence‚Äîno joke‚Äîfor 10-20 minutes. Sometimes I‚Äôve even made coffee or worked until he said something. He almost never tells me anything on his own, except for sensational news like a new purchase or family drama. Otherwise, he never shares anything personal, nor does he spark interesting topics or discussions. He‚Äôs a thoroughly passive person, and I‚Äôve come to terms with that. But what I can‚Äôt accept is this constant disappointment whenever I want more than just lying next to each other on the couch. 

Other activities have also completely stopped. He‚Äôs too tired to go for walks or do anything else. I managed to convince him to go to two zoos and one movie theater, but only on very good days. Health-wise, there‚Äôs nothing wrong. We‚Äôve checked every possible blood value and corrected any deficiencies with medication. Still, no improvement. 

I just can‚Äôt anymore. The need for sex and deep intimacy, which I always have to beg for or signal with a metaphorical megaphone (only to be rejected most of the time), frustrates me. It makes me feel unattractive, undesired. I‚Äôm falling back into a depressive hole. 

Even during our vacations together‚Äîwhich he made half unbearable through his lack of affection, passive-aggressiveness, outright aggression, indifference, excessive drinking, and general dissatisfaction (even blaming me for things like car accidents caused by his own mistakes)‚Äîthere was only one instance of sex. If I was lucky, maybe a handjob. Once, after repeated pleading, we had sex (**once**) during a vacation‚Äîit‚Äôs just sad. At least when we‚Äôre not on vacation or staying in a hotel, he‚Äôs kind, attentive, and the perfect son-in-law. 

But otherwise, he‚Äôs always too tired for everything‚Äîif I even get an explanation at all. ‚ÄúNot today,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not,‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just watch an episode on AppleTV+.‚Äù Meanwhile, he has no problem doing heavy physical labor as a favor for friends at a private gardening business‚Äîsuddenly, the tiredness disappears. 

Of course, handjobs are also rare exceptions. Has he still bought sexy fetish underwear that he never wears for me? Has he still purchased a BDSM set we‚Äôve only used once? Has he still bought sex toys for himself? He‚Äôs definitely not asexual. No doubt. 

I‚Äôve suggested several times that an open relationship would be fine with me. But he doesn‚Äôt want that‚Äîhe‚Äôs too jealous. But to outright accuse him of never initiating anything sexual? I can‚Äôt. Out of fear that I might leave, he‚Äôd probably do anything. But I never want to emotionally blackmail him or coerce him into sex. That‚Äôs why I refuse to set an ultimatum. 

At least the recent revival of date nights and outings seems to be working. He‚Äôs at least mentioned some plans. 

I‚Äôve already discussed this extensively with my sibling, my mom, and a dedicated chat group with all my friends who totally support me but also assume that it‚Äôs likely to get even less rather than more. Everyone says it‚Äôs unlikely to get better and that I should end it. And now, I‚Äôve already taken steps to leave him, but he‚Äôs completely clueless. For him, none of this seems like a big deal. And I don‚Äôt want to be trapped in this relationship for years without any spark. Love alone is not enough for me. 

He‚Äôs currently in the hospital for a necessary surgery, and I‚Äôll visit him tomorrow. For now, I‚Äôm keeping up appearances. He is still firmly convinced that we will move in together soon and maybe get a dog, but then I would end up as exactly the result everyone here warned against. Ten years in a relationship, my twenties gone and unfulfilled, stuck in a lease that‚Äôs hard to get out of, and with a dog to take care of.

But in all of this, I feel like the worst antagonist in a love drama that I could possibly imagine. My heart races every time I think about my plans. I feel sorrow. I feel pain. At the same time, every night I look forward to dreaming‚Äîsometimes of a wild night. 

P.S. We‚Äôve already taken an in-depth fetish test, and I would follow everything exactly and make his fantasies come true‚Äîeven if, by God, they aren‚Äôt mine‚Äîif only he‚Äôd want to. ",3,1732846550.0,DeadBedrooms,3,1.0,False
1h2bf7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Photobooks/comments/1h2bf7i/fun_stuff/,Fun Stuff,"Hi! I hope I'm not transgressing the rules--from what I could gather I don't think I am--but I wanted to make two recommendations for lovers of photobooks.

Number 1, if you live anywhere near Nashville, or ever find yourself passing through, you \*must\* stop at¬†[Rhino Booksellers](https://rhinobooksellers.com/). It is about as classical an old-school second-hand bookshop run by legitimate bibliophiles as you will ever find--complete with bookshop cat, and friends of the proprietors who drop in at mid day with their guitars and have a completely informal jam session. (And there is a fantastic, tiny coffee shop a couple doors down.) They have a pretty nice selection of used photobooks on a shelf out in the store. But if you stop in, you must ask them to see the ""vault.""

In the back of the shop there is another, ""secret"" room with a security door where they keep all the \*really\* good stuff--including some certified classics of photobook history. At not at all unreasonable prices, as such things go. In two visits there on travels between Indianapolis and Atlanta, I've picked up a first edition of Bruce Davidson's East 100th Street, a really nice first-edition copy of Irving Penn's Flowers, a retrospective of Paul Strand's work, a handsome two-volume Focal Press Encyclopedia of Photography, and a couple of other nice things. And if I wasn't limited by budget, I could have easily walked out with several hundred dollars worth of other really tasty items. They might have \*the\* best selection of second-hand photo books I've seen in either the US or the UK for a non-specialist store. (In fact, the only second-hand store I've ever seen that had a bigger and better inventory was Photo Books International in London, which of course was dedicated to one topic and unfortunately closed several years ago.)

My second one is this: if you have a few like-minded people in your area, it's really fun to do a photobook meetup. I live in Indianapolis, and I was inspired by the semi-monthly Thursday Photobook Throwdown run by the proprietor of¬†[Aurora PhotoCentre](https://www.auroraphoto.org/)¬†here. The gallery has a pretty nice collection of books, and folks drop in and bring their own books to pass around. (Last month she brought in her personal French 1st Edition--**the**¬†very first edition--of Frank's Les Am√©ricains, which was a treat.) Since I myself have a really big-ass shelf of photobooks of pretty good quality and range, I asked her if she would mind if I did one at my house, in months where she didn't do one--to which she of course is always invited.) I stocked up on beverages, adult and otherwise, and invited others to bring anything they liked in that line, and especially their favorite photobooks.

We've done that twice now. I had seven people show up each time (including a few repeats), and everyone seems to have enjoyed it so much--I certainly did--that they all asked when the next one was, and made clear they want to be invited. We had a nice mix of experienced photographers, young aspiring photographers, highly educated and sophisticated book connoisseurs, and others. Great convos, and everyone got a chance to see some really fine books from a variety of tastes and (particularly from my own collection) to see some books they had heard of but had never held.

As I say, if you can round up enough people who are interested and a good, comfortable venue to do it, you will find it extremely enjoyable and a great way to discover--and share--things that are new to everyone. And help yourself and others form friendships over a shared passion. I highly recommend it.",1,1732846497.0,Photobooks,0,1.0,False
