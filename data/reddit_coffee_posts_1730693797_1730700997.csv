1gj7u63,https://i.redd.it/dx7vjxl2utyd1.jpeg,Frequent blocked pores and stressed skin  [routine help],"I am 22 f with  combo skin and lately it  has honestly been suffering ..since 2020 I‚Äôve used great professional product as much as I can and use precaution when touching my face with dirty hands, but also needing to wear a face mask for my work.I‚Äôm wondering if my skin is dehydrated, congested, stressed or just hormonal acne ( or a couple above). I‚Äôve been using :

Morning: Sa cerave cleanser, dermalogica superfoliant (weekly) , it cosmetics serum with spf50 

 night : same cerave sa cleanser,  the murad intense hydrating cream, spot treatment gel, and the dark circle correct (sometimes twice a day) sometime i also use the corsrx aha serum. 

I don‚Äôt wear makeup regularly and sometimes have also thrown a few masks in the mix but it‚Äôs pretty rare but here are some I used and liked the shorter term results: ( dermalogica blackhead fizz mask, peelfoliant treatment , lush masks ect) 
I minimize touching my face and picking but I do sometimes out of stress and anxiety. It seems like my skin has texture and trapped white stringy stuff and even if I exfoliate and try to leave it builds up, I also have so much congestion around my chin and clogged pores just spread. I eat a pretty clean diet with high protein foods and stay away from ultra processed foods and snacks, work out, take collagen supplements and whey protein also. I also do not drink alcohol but I do drink coffee everyday. I‚Äôm not sure if this impacts things greatly but any tips and advice would be appreciated. 

Also if there are any product recommendations  I would love to hear, or any folks who relate I would love to hear

1gj7tiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1gj7tiq/i_feel_like_utis_are_ruining_my_life/,I feel like UTIS are ruining my life ,"Backstory and advice needed 

I‚Äôve had chronic UTIS for the past 2 almost 3 years. They come every 4 months, sometimes every 2 months. Before they were because of latex condoms (I have very sensitive skin and assume that was why), they stopped for a bit then started up again. After 3ish times I went to the doctor and I had ovarian cysts (17 at the time) that ruptured and were probably causing them. Now no matter what I do, proper hygiene, pee after sex, not even having sex for a week or more I still get them. I take cranberry pills and try to keep my sugar down and don‚Äôt drink coffee. Can anyone please help me? I‚Äôve stayed up entire nights (12-8 am) because AZO tablets (ultra strength and taking 2 at a time, if the time passes even 4), 2 arthritis Tylenol AND ibuprofen don‚Äôt work until much later (I take at 12 am they don‚Äôt work until 9 am or so, but with other pain they work almost immediately) they aren‚Äôt super super painful or filled with blood, but the right amount of discomfort to cry over. Please someone help me, I feel like they are ruining my life and sleep schedule. 
Also to clarify my boyfriend is very clean and I make sure he is I highly doubt he is the sole problem (like I said we will test and not have sex for 2 weeks and still I will get a UTI)

Also I‚Äôve been having UTI like symptoms (urge to pee) and the culture came back as not a UTI. please can anybody tell me if they think this is something more? My doctors keep dismissing me and I feel like it could be something more like a kidney infection (they can last for years) Please tell me if this is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or if anyone can relate!!!!

EDIT: I was put on birth control (Kelnor) to help with the cysts and they shouldn‚Äôt be the cause

1gj7t0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafedesire/comments/1gj7t0e/why_cafe_desire_coffee_tea_vending_machines_are/,Why Cafe Desire Coffee & Tea Vending Machines are Essential for Employee Satisfaction,"# Coffee & Tea Vending Machines are Essential for Employee

https://preview.redd.it/lpzy89vettyd1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9399a1a75e0c849aee219b9a95b85ffc872dfe1

In today‚Äôs fast-paced work environment, employee satisfaction has become a priority for companies seeking to create a productive and happy workforce. One often overlooked factor contributing to employee satisfaction is the quality of the refreshments available at the workplace. A convenient and enjoyable coffee or tea break can positively impact morale, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. This is where¬†[**Cafe Desire's coffee and tea vending machines**](https://cafedesireonline.com/products/led-coffee-machine-4-lane)¬†make a difference, providing an easy solution to satisfy employees' beverage needs.

# The Convenience of Automatic Coffee & Tea Machines

When it comes to convenience, an¬†**automatic coffee and tea machine**¬†can be a game-changer in any workplace. Traditional coffee and tea preparation can be time-consuming, requiring employees to measure, brew, and clean up after each cup.¬†*Cafe Desire's*¬†[vending machines](https://wa.me/919000061547)¬†simplify this process by offering a seamless, one-touch solution.

7. **Promotes Social Interaction and Collaboration**

I am pretty sure she has no feelings for me, her previous bestfriend had feelings for her, and now they are not on talking terms. A few of her female friends have told me that she is kinda making me as his replacement. The thing is, I might catch feelings if this continues, which is why I have started to maintain my distance (like saying no if she asks me to come).

I recently bought some 3200mhz DDR Corsair Vengeance ram. After installing it and turning on the XMP profile for it, I had a lot of blue screens until I turned the XMP profile off. I still had one or two blue screens after turning XMP off so I decided to just buy some Corsair Vengeance 2667MHZ ram instead since I saw somewhere that suggested that 3200mhz ram can lead to problems in some razer laptops. 

After installing the 2667mhz ram I noticed that computer just booted up quickly and didn't go through that 30 second bios discovery that happened when I went from stock ram to the 3200mhz ram. 

I went into the BIOS and noticed that the profiles still showed up as 3200mhz. 
Is there a way to force my laptop to rediscover the hardware? Do I need to enable XMP even though I am matching the standard ram speed?

CPU-Z is showing the ram as 2667mhz.

Single Mom Fighting the good fight. ,"I was in Med Billing 20yrs+ & picked up Ubering 2nd job 1.5yr ago. Due to camp, rent & car pmnt. Lost my Medical job & decided to go FT Uber bc it's fits my schedule single mom. We'll ubering 1.5yr no accidents, tickets & my rating never dropped ever 4.94, 3000 rides 1000 5 star. I drive CT, Mass & NY for them. 1wk 4am im working , turn off app to go n grab coffee. Come back out. They got complaints of concern on my driving.  I thought with them all week I took a class that was recommended just to get back on the app and they told me that that wasn't going to help my situation mind you the class cost $59 I had to borrow the money. So for this last week I haven't had any income I finally went through the gas that was in my car. I need to be able to pick my daughter up from school this week. My bills are probably 3,000 a month and that's because it's so high. And have a car payment. Child support I think maybe I get $300 for the entire month. You can see the numbers aren't there. Anyhow I would be able to pay the money back when that money shows up this week it's usually direct deposited. I have Cash app or venmo. I'm not here to take advantage of anyone especially if they were helping me out. I've no desire to be a shitty person. But if anyone feels that they can help me out please let me know I'll be forever grateful thank you. This is the mild version. This is what just going to help me for the week but the overall picture is very stressful I honestly never catch a break for myself. But I love my daughter and I keep fighting. I signed up for Lyft  just waiting for the background check to finish approval. I found some grants that help single parents on the computer I'm going to apply for this week. As well as some online jobs that I can do at home and maybe Uber was just going to be a thing of the past.

I‚Äôve been dealing with worsening breakouts lately, even after seeing a dermatologist and trying prescribed treatments. So far, nothing seems to be making a difference, and I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit hopeless.

**Here‚Äôs a bit of context**:

* I‚Äôve had hormonal acne for a while, but it‚Äôs been particularly persistent recently.
* I‚Äôve tried various treatments (prescriptions from my dermatologist included), but my skin is just not responding.
* I‚Äôm also looking into lifestyle factors like diet and stress that could impact my skin.

* I typically drink coffee twice a day (specifically brewed coffee, no sugar).
* I‚Äôm from the Philippines, so I‚Äôm seeking advice on accessible, affordable products or remedies that have worked for others with similar issues.
* I‚Äôm also considering dietary adjustments (like reducing dairy and adding ginger shots) but would love input on any changes that have made a difference for others.

**What I‚Äôm looking for**:

* Product or skincare recommendations, especially affordable options available in the Philippines.
* Any diet changes, supplements, or lifestyle tips that worked for you.
* Personal experiences with treatments, products, or routines that helped manage or reduce hormonal acne.

She was on the sidewalk and stopped at an intersection where a car was waiting at a stop sign to turn right. My daughter was coming from his right, and he was most likely looking left, waiting for traffic so he could turn. My daughter stopped and then proceeded when she thought the driver had seen her. As soon as she was in front of the car, the driver proceeded to turn and hit her. The driver was a 16 year old male. My daughter was not seriously injured, and the kid was freaking out. My daughter got up and consoled him. Thinking she was okay, she locked her bike up by the coffee shop (it had a bent wheel so she couldn't ride it home) and they exchanged numbers and he gave my daughter a ride home. A few hours later, my daughter was in some pain and decided to go to urgent care. They sent her on to the E.R. as there was concern she nay have had internal bleeding.

My daughter texted this kid about the accident, and that we wanted his insurance information. He texted back that he wanted to settle it without insurance as he was afraid his dad would kill him, and his insurance would be negatively impacted. They texted several times, and now the kid isn't responding. We keep asking him to have his parents call us to settle it, but he won't text back. Finally, we filed a police report, but as it has almost been a month they said there was nothing they could do and that we should look into getting an attorney.

Medical bill was only 2500, and my daughter is fine. I know it's not much money, but it is a chunck of change. Through the magic of the internet, i know his name and his parents names. Is it even worth persuing this with a personal injury lawyer? Would they even be interested in something so small? And no. I haven't talked to his parents yet. I thought about boping over to where his dad works and confronting him, but to be honest, I'm just tired of dealing with this kid and how he just isn't doing anything to take responsibility.

Everyone, myself and the police included, has told my daughter that next time, you call 911, to which she alwas says, ""Next time?""

TL:DR, daighter got hit by car on her bike. We owe hospital 2500. Driver is not responding to texts. Is it even worth pursuing through legal means?",4,1730700262.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

Vlad King looked ready to start putting alcohol in his coffee if his expression was anything to go by.

""Hehe...w-well...y-you see..."" Izuku tried to say something with an an awkward look on his face as he tried to scratch the back of his head. Tried being the key word as his head was sandwitched between Yaoyorozu and Kendo's breasts. If that wasn't bad enough there was also Ashido and Tokage hugging his legs, Kinoko and Jirou on his back, Kodai and Uraraka hugging his sides, Yanagi hugging him from the front and Tsuyu and Pony holding his hands. Only Ibara and Hagakure weren't hugging him but they still stood next to him and looked flushed, well Ibara did but Hagakure's actions with her visible clothes made it obvious that she was shy. A little away from them was Hatsume sketching something while looking at Izuku with hearts in her eyes.

""Go on Midoriya. We want to hear an explanation before Monoma gets free again and starts to rant."" Vlad King said as he looked towards Kirishima and Tetsutetsu holding Monoma back.

""YOU DEVIOUS 1A SCUM! YOU DARE SEDUCE OUR CLASSMATES LIKE THEY ARE SOME KIND OF FLOOZIES FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH?! IS 1A REALLY THAT MORALLY REPUGNANT THAT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING SO MORALLY DISGUSTING?!""

""Calm down Monoma!"" Vlad King said as Izuku kept blushing.

""Y-you see, my Q-Quirk was originally called ""S-Sweet dreams"". It made all the women I have contact with have...very erotic dreams involving me after which they become more affectionate with me for a month, u-unless they are related to me like my mother in which case they just have happy dreams. It's why I went into Gen ed instead of Hero course. "" He explained, quickly correcting the mistake and removing the implication of his mother having erotic dreams with him.

""Is that what happened with the girls?"" Aizawa asked looking at the female students and seeing Izuku nod.

""I sense a catch here."" Vlad King asked as Izuku nodded again, ""Go on.""

""Sometime after I came into...contact with Yaoyorozu and ended up k-kissed by her the day after, my Quirk somehow evolved and made people see dreams of the future with me. Apparently I was a great h-husband and f-father in those dreams and for some reason I kept running into the girls of each class and that's how I ended up in this situation."" Izuku gestured to the girls who all looked at him adoringly while also looking like they were ready to fight for him.

""What happens if they have prolonged contact with you?"" Aizaws asked.

""The effect can enhance and they may get affectionate with me for longer than a month.""

""You didn't touch anyone else right?"" Vlad King asked him.

""No. My classmates steered clear from me after learning about my Quirk.""

""What about Midnight?"" Aizawa asked again as Izuku blushed even more.

""She makes sure that we don't have contact during and even after class. Apparently she has enough problems as it is and doesn't want her student to be in her dreams.""

""How long do we have to wait for the Quirk's effects to wear off?"" Aizawa asked ready to use his own Quirk

""It evolved and the girls are in contact with me so...six months at best and a year at worst."" He saw Aizawa's eyes glow, ""that won't work sensei. The effects are already in place. You are just making sure the effect doesn't stack.""

""It's still better than them being love struck girls for all three years.""

""Now let go of the poor boy and sit back on your seats girls!"" Recovery Girl ordered them as she waved her cane. The two teachers looked at the doctor then at Izuku who shook his head.

""My Quirk works on most women but not elderly women, children and my relatives, sensei."" The two sighed in relief.

Basically Izuku has a harem but he is a student of Gen Ed and he doesn't even want it to begin with and gets into shenanigans because the girls he affected want to see the future they saw in their dreams happen even if it means fighting each other. Yaoyorozu is the wielder of OfA and in this world it doesn't sap the wielder's life and she ended up sharing a portion of its power with Izuku causing his Quirk to evolve and starting the entire situation in the first place. He also unintentionally gets in contact with Toga and she becomes his terrifying stalker and it gets worse when some pro heroines are accidentally affected.

Turns out, juggling is ridiculously hard. I spent WEEKS just throwing balls all over my room, breaking a mug, sending a ball flying out my window, etc. My cat started looking at me with a mix of pity and genuine fear.

But after enough practice, I got the hang of it! Now, I can do the classic three-ball pattern, some cool moves, and even kind of throw in a fourth ball (keyword: *kind of*). I should feel proud, right? And I do‚Ä¶ but here‚Äôs where things went off the rails.

You'll want to do everything, eating all local food, see all historic spots, see all the Tuscan villages, but that's not always possible. 

This 10-day Tuscany itinerary gives you plenty of time to explore the highlights as well as the hidden gems that make the region so special. From Florence to Siena, from vineyards to seaside views, you‚Äôll experience the best of Tuscany‚Äôs rich history, art, and cuisine. Let me tell you everything about this Tuscany itinerary drafted by a local!

**Day 1: Arrival in Florence and a Taste of Renaissance**

Welcome to Tuscany! Arrive in Florence, the heart of the Renaissance. After checking into your hotel, start your journey by exploring the city centre. Begin at Piazza del Duomo, where you‚Äôll find Florence‚Äôs stunning cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, crowned with Brunelleschi's famous dome. If you‚Äôre up for it, climb the dome for an unparalleled view of Florence‚Äôs rooftops, but be sure to book tickets in advance.

Afterward, stroll over to Piazza della Signoria, Florence‚Äôs historical and political hub, where you‚Äôll find sculptures like Neptune's Fountain and a replica of Michelangelo‚Äôs David. For lunch, grab a bite at All‚ÄôAntico Vinaio, famous for its loaded focaccia sandwiches that are as delicious as they are filling.

In the afternoon, head to the Uffizi Gallery. This world-famous museum houses works by Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Leonardo da Vinci. Wrap up your day with a dinner at Osteria Vini e Vecchi Sapori, a small family-owned spot known for its cosy vibe and traditional Florentine dishes. Try the ribollita, a classic Tuscan soup.



**Day 2: More Art in Florence**

Today is all about diving deeper into Florence‚Äôs art and culture. Start with a visit to the Accademia Gallery to see Michelangelo‚Äôs masterpiece, the David. After admiring this iconic statue, take a leisurely walk to the San Lorenzo Market for some shopping. The market is packed with leather goods, souvenirs, and local food items. Grab a snack at Mercato Centrale upstairs, where you‚Äôll find a variety of stalls serving everything from fresh pasta to gelato.

In the afternoon, cross the Ponte Vecchio, Florence‚Äôs famous bridge lined with jewellery shops, to reach the Oltrarno district. Wander through Boboli Gardens, a beautiful green space with fountains, sculptures, and incredible views. Finish your day with a sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo, where you can watch the city light up as the sun goes down.

For dinner, head back into town to Trattoria Mario, known for its Bistecca alla Fiorentina. It‚Äôs popular with both locals and tourists, so prepare for a wait, but it‚Äôs well worth it!



**Day 3: Day Trip to Pisa and Lucca**

Start early and take a day trip to Pisa. It‚Äôs about an hour‚Äôs drive from Florence, or you can take the train. In Pisa, head straight to Piazza dei Miracoli to see the Leaning Tower, Pisa Cathedral, and the Baptistery. Take a moment to climb the Leaning Tower if you‚Äôve pre-booked tickets, or simply enjoy the iconic architecture from below.

After a morning in Pisa, drive 30 minutes to [**Lucca**](https://tricksandtrips.com/1-day-in-lucca-itinerary/), a charming medieval city. Don't get me wrong, I like Pisa, but Lucca is more authentic for a day out in Tuscany, so have lunch and spend the rest of the day there.

Begin with lunch at Trattoria Da Leo where you can try Lucca‚Äôs traditional dish, tortelli lucchese. After lunch, rent bikes and cycle around Lucca‚Äôs 4-km-long city walls for a fun and unique way to see the sights.

Explore Lucca‚Äôs old town, with highlights like San Michele in Foro and Piazza dell‚ÄôAnfiteatro, a square built on the site of an ancient Roman amphitheatre. Stay the night in Lucca and enjoy a relaxed dinner at Buca di Sant‚ÄôAntonio, a historic restaurant with a warm atmosphere and delicious Lucchese specialties.



**Day 4: Day Trip to Cinque Terre**

Today, take an optional day trip to the Cinque Terre. Leave early in the morning by train from Lucca, and you‚Äôll reach this collection of colourful seaside villages in about two hours. Start in Riomaggiore and make your way through the other villages by train or boat (hiking is also an option if you‚Äôre up for it).

For lunch, stop at Ristorante Belforte in Vernazza for some fresh seafood and incredible views of the Ligurian Sea.

Spend the afternoon wandering through the villages, taking in the coastal scenery, and maybe going for a swim if the weather‚Äôs warm. Return to Lucca in the evening and enjoy a quiet night in or a casual dinner at a local pizzeria.



**Day 5: Lucca to San Gimignano via Chianti**

Check out from Lucca and drive toward San Gimignano, stopping in the Chianti region along the way. This area is known for its vineyards, so plan to visit a few wineries. Castello di Verrazzano and Antinori nel Chianti Classico offer tours and tastings where you can sample Chianti‚Äôs famous red wines.

In the afternoon, arrive in San Gimignano, known for its medieval towers and beautiful town squares. Explore Piazza della Cisterna and Piazza del Duomo before checking into your hotel. In the evening, try Cum Quibus Ristorante for a mix of traditional and modern Tuscan dishes. Be sure to save room for dessert, as San Gimignano is also famous for its gelato at Gelateria Dondoli.



**Day 6: Exploring San Gimignano**

Spend the day exploring San Gimignano‚Äôs charming streets, medieval towers, and artisan shops. Start with a visit to Torre Grossa, the tallest tower in town, for sweeping views of the surrounding countryside. Then head to the Collegiata di San Gimignano, a beautiful church with frescoes depicting biblical stories.

For lunch, grab a table at La Mangiatoia, known for its delicious pasta and rustic Tuscan atmosphere. In the afternoon, wander through Museo della Tortura, a quirky museum dedicated to medieval torture devices, or simply enjoy the peaceful streets and local shops.

In the evening, dine at Ristorante San Martino 26, a refined restaurant that offers a fresh take on Tuscan cuisine. Enjoy the relaxed, intimate atmosphere as you sample dishes made with local ingredients.



**Day 7: San Gimignano to Siena**

Check out of San Gimignano and head toward Siena, stopping at any villages or vineyards along the way. Once in Siena, check into your hotel and start exploring the city centre. Begin at Piazza del Campo, Siena‚Äôs famous shell-shaped square, and visit the Siena Cathedral, a masterpiece of Italian Gothic architecture.

For lunch, try Antica Trattoria Papei in Piazza del Mercato, known for its traditional Tuscan dishes like pici pasta and wild boar. In the afternoon, climb the Torre del Mangia for panoramic views over Siena‚Äôs rooftops and countryside.

For dinner, head to Osteria Le Logge, a charming spot near Piazza del Campo with an extensive wine list and a menu that changes seasonally. Try the pici cacio e pepe for a true taste of Siena.



**Day 8: Exploring Siena and Monteriggioni**

Spend another day exploring Siena. Visit the Santa Maria della Scala museum, an old hospital turned museum with frescoes and artefacts. Afterward, stroll around the medieval streets, stopping by shops and cafes for a coffee or gelato break.

In the afternoon, take a short drive to Monteriggioni, a small walled village just outside Siena. Wander the cobblestone streets and enjoy the views from the ancient walls. For dinner, return to Siena or try Il Feudo, a cosy restaurant within Monteriggioni‚Äôs walls.



**Day 9: Val d‚ÄôOrcia - Pienza, Montepulciano, and Montalcino**

Today, set off for the Val d‚ÄôOrcia, Tuscany‚Äôs most picturesque region. Start in Pienza, a charming town known for its Pecorino cheese. Wander through the narrow streets and enjoy the views from the town walls.

Next, head to Montepulciano, famous for its Vino Nobile wine. Visit a winery, such as Contucci or Avignonesi, and enjoy a tasting. For lunch, try Osteria Acquacheta, known for its friendly vibe and massive Florentine steaks.

In the afternoon, drive to Montalcino, the home of Brunello wine. Stop by a winery like Biondi Santi for a tasting, then enjoy a relaxed dinner in Montalcino before heading back to your accommodation.



**Day 10: Relax and Departure**

Take your last day in Tuscany slow. Start with a relaxed breakfast, enjoying one final cappuccino and pastry. If there‚Äôs a local market nearby, stroll through to pick up a few souvenirs like olive oil or wine. For lunch, treat yourself to a Tuscan meal‚Äîmaybe pici pasta or ribollita‚Äîat a favourite spot in town.

If you‚Äôve got some extra time, a quick visit to a vineyard or nearby village is a perfect farewell. As you head to the airport or train station, take in those last views of the countryside, soaking up every last bit of Tuscany.



**More Information to Plan a Tuscany Itinerary**

**How to get around Tuscany?** Renting a car is the best way to explore Tuscany at your own pace, especially for visiting vineyards, countryside villages, and remote sites. However, if you‚Äôre staying in a major city like Florence, Rome, or Pisa, joining day trips can work well, covering key sights without the hassle of driving.

**Best time to visit Tuscany?** The best time to visit Tuscany is in spring (April to June) or autumn (September to October) when the weather is mild, and the crowds are smaller. These months also offer picturesque landscapes with blooming flowers in spring and vibrant autumn colours in the vineyards.

**How much to plan for 10 days in Tuscany?** A 10-day trip to Tuscany can range widely depending on your travel style. Budget around ‚Ç¨100‚Äì‚Ç¨200 per day for mid-range accommodations, meals, car rental, and activities. For a more luxurious trip, expect to spend upwards of ‚Ç¨300 per day, especially if staying in boutique hotels or taking guided tours.

**Are 10 days in Tuscany enough?** Yes, 10 days is ideal for exploring Tuscany‚Äôs main cities and smaller towns without rushing. You‚Äôll have time to visit Florence, Siena, San Gimignano, and enjoy countryside stays in places like Val d‚ÄôOrcia. Ten days lets you experience Tuscany‚Äôs highlights and some off-the-beaten-path spots.",1,1730699822.0,TuscanyTourism,0,1.0,False

1gj7gom,https://i.redd.it/rzdpmi7kptyd1.jpeg,Family Struggles,"I started my weight loss journey in 2022. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù. I started at 238 lbs and a BMI of 35 (top right picture). I did a year of strictly calorie counting and exercising at least 3 days a week (mostly weight lifting) and lost 30 lbs. (Bottom right picture is 19 lbs down from my starting weight.) I started a new stressful job abroad with a lot of travel which significantly interfered with my ability to plan meals and get my exercise in. Having done a weight loss journey before that got derailed secondary to a stressful job before, I started freaking out when in early 2024 I saw the numbers on the scale slowly starting to creep back up. 

That‚Äôs when I started ozempic in March 2024. It was pretty easy and safe to get abroad from an online clinic (currently get it in Japan). I was 208 lbs at that time. I started at 0.25 mg and gradually increased by increments of 0.25 mg. I noticed the first effects within 24 hours. As others have explained, the food noise completely disappeared. When I m stressed, I don‚Äôt crave sugary beverages or sweets. It‚Äôs seriously been a game changer. Goal weight was 175 lbs which I reached within 6 months (left picture). I‚Äôve lost 9 more lbs since then on the same dose 1.5 mg. I‚Äôm definitely in my maintenance phase and am working on solidifying my exercise regimen and eating habits before slowly weaning. CW 166lbs, BMI 24.5. All pictures of are me in the same red dress. Adverse effects for me were nausea (vomited three times after drinking small amounts of alcohol that I usually would be able to drink) and heartburn. I‚Äôve always been constipated so I just double downed on my usual constipation regimen (coffee and miralax works wonders for me). Nausea has almost completely gone away. And I‚Äôm able to drink alcohol now that I know my new limits and stay FAR away from any citrusy cocktails.

I feel great now. And I think I look great too. At my heaviest, I would get out of breath bending down to tie my shoes. Now I do this effortlessly. My ankle pain has completely gone away, my leg/feet swelling only occurs on planes (and doesn‚Äôt occur at all if I wear compression socks), and my knee pain is significantly better (still need some physical therapy). I hope my story inspires others!  

Now, I am currently struggling with the opinions of friends and family. I haven‚Äôt told many people about being on ozempic. Family members have told me that they think people that use weight loss drugs are cheating. I know this isn‚Äôt true and that even on weight loss medications you still have to do some work and that it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. Friends have told me that they don‚Äôt think I would need ozempic because I lost so much weight on my own and that I am wasting my money. I‚Äôve had to justify my desire to lose weight at every stage of my journey as people never seemed to really notice my weight/there‚Äôs some cultural acceptance of heavier set women. I was frequently told that I ‚Äúwear my weight well‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt seen many family or friends since I am abroad for about a year. 

With the holidays coming up, I am starting to get nervous about going back home and having people see me at this new weight for the first time. Being from a Caribbean family, 100% my relatives will mention my weight even before they say hello (IYKYK!). I do get those comments from friends living abroad now and it does bother me. I know my family‚Äôs comments will bother me even more. I‚Äôm not really sure if anything I do or think will completely make those comments not affect me. Part of me wants to just tell everyone I have been using ozempic as many of my relatives have excessive weight and its consequences and they can benefit from weight loss medication. Another part of me just wants to continue telling people back home that I‚Äôve been doing calorie counting and exercising like I did before. Or I could just tell everyone it‚Äôs none of their business üôÉ But any advice or suggestions (or any kind words!) would be greatly appreciated especially if you come from a Caribbean background. 

TLDR: Added ozempic to my weigh loss journey and finally reached (and exceeded!) my goal weight. Now anxious about family seeing me for the first time at my new weight and would love advice about dealing with this pressure. ",6,1730699292.0,Ozempic,0,0.88,False

Hey, fellow Travel Trotters! üëã Have you ever found yourself in a new city, surrounded by picture-perfect tourist spots, yet yearning for a deeper connection with the local culture? Well, you‚Äôre not alone. As someone who‚Äôs hopped across 50 different countries, I‚Äôve learned a thing or two about diving into the heart of a place beyond its landmarks. Here are some tried-and-true tips to help you experience local life authentically wherever your wanderlust takes you!

### 1. Stay with Locals üè°
One of the best ways to immerse yourself is to stay in local neighborhoods. Consider using platforms that connect travelers with host families or local residents willing to rent out rooms. Not only will you get a unique place to stay, but you‚Äôll also have the chance to learn about local customs firsthand. My nights in a rustic homestay in Bali were filled with stories, laughter, and arguably the best home-cooked meals of my life!

### 2. Embrace the Local Cuisine üçΩÔ∏è
Hit the local markets or street food stalls. They‚Äôre often bustling with traditional flavors and life. Don't hesitate to ask the vendor about their dishes ‚Äì most are eager to share their culinary secrets. While in Mexico City, I followed the smoky aroma of street tacos, chatted with vendors, and even got a mini cooking lesson in the process!

### 3. Participate in Local Events and Festivals üéâ
Check out local calendars for events or festivals that align with your visit. Participating in these celebrations gives you a peek into the cultural fabric of a place. During a trip to India, I stumbled upon a vibrant Holi festival, where the air was filled with colors, music, and joy. It remains one of my most cherished memories.

### 4. Prioritize Learning Key Phrases of the Local Language üó£Ô∏è
Knowing a few words or phrases can break the ice and show residents that you respect their culture. Simple greetings or expressions like ‚Äúthank you‚Äù can go a long way in making connections.

### 5. Connect with Locals üí¨
Join local forums or community pages to meet locals or expats who can offer insider tips and perspectives. Sometimes, a simple chat can lead to unexpected adventures. A casual conversation with a shop owner in Cairo led me to a tucked-away coffee shop frequented only by locals.

**So, what's your go-to method for immersing into a new culture? Share your stories or tips below! üòä And if you‚Äôre curious about more such adventures and resources, be sure to check our [Travel Trotters Beacons page](https://beacons.ai/traveltrotters) for a trove of travel treasures!**

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I looked that damn Siren straight in his warm brown eyes and said ""Awww fffff-ragglerock."" The weight of my head was pulling me down and there was only bare ice in my glass. I waved to the bartender and pointed at my head. He set his rag and glass down.

""Now, Captain.."" started the luscious hunk of man meat before me. I raised a finger. ""I'm far, far too drunk to start a conversation with you. One sec."" A server set a drink between my hands. Might've been two. Whole room seemed a bit wobbly. I grasped it firmly, and slammed the whole thing in a single breath. Tasted like black licorice and cinnamon ring. I nearly gagged. Been a while since I'd put my mouth on something quite that foul. The world started to coalesce. After a moment, I was a little wool-headed but basically functional.

""Did that help make it better?"" asked the Siren earnestly.

I leaned back, willing the taste from my tongue, and failing. ""Better is relative. What do you want?""

""I'm‚Ä¶""

I cut him off. ""I don't much care who you are. If you're here, that means you're working for my father. Whom I have no intention of seeing, or returning to. So let's just cut to the chase. How much time do I have after I kill you?"" The killing part was a bluff, but he didn't need to know that.

""‚Ä¶Niall Edgar Ruskin Iris Seabeck,"" he finished. ""Are you going to finish that?"" he gestured at my ice-laden glass. I slid it across the table. The fuzz in my head was starting to clear. ""Knock yourself out. Wait. Is your name Siren spelled backwards?""

Niall crunched down on a piece of ice, and started tapping his fingers like he was ticking off a list. ""Huh. Yeah. I guess it is. Weird. Hey why's everyone looking at me?""

The hairs on the back of my neck started to stand up. With the pounding in my head I hadn't noticed the bar had begun to slowly clear out, leaving a much more sedate and curious crowd. Barry was nowhere to be seen. Unfortunately that meant that Niall and I were more than mildly interesting, and not in the randomly-forgettable-strangers-telling-tall-tales kind of way. I snatched the glass away from the stupidly hot man sitting across from me, and whispered hoarsely, ""I don't think either of us want to be noticed here, and I'd rather not go around causing trouble on a planet I *just* got to. Can you sing something to get them to pay attention somewhere else while we get the hell out of here? Whatever our business is, I'd rather not conduct it in public.""

""Oh, uh."" Niall scratched the back of his head and gave me a lopsided grin. ""My partner was supposed to be doing that. I uh. I can't sing too good."" I rolled my eyes. ""Oh for the love of. You're telling me there's another Siren, and that she's *not* distracting the bar patrons whilst your impeccable abs are on full display?""

Niall nodded emphatically and fluttered his wings a little. ""Oh yes. We always travel in pairs. Safer, you know. Plus it helps to have someone who can, y'know. Sing with a capital S. I guess.""

""And it doesn't bother you that she's not Singing with a capital S right now?""

Niall had the gall to actually think about it. If his face hadn't been perfect, I might have smashed it into the table. ""I guess that would mean she's in some kind of trouble."" He started to look panicked. ""We gotta find her, Captain!""

Dammit. If he'd left off the ""captain"" I probably would have told him to take a long walk out a short airlock. Unhappily for me, I had a protective streak and a sense of morality that was a damn sight inconvenient, especially when dealing with my dad's minions. It wasn't *their* fault they were minions. ""Ugh, fine."" I hauled my sorry keister out of the booth. Niall followed behind. On the way past the bar, I took off one of my rings and tossed it to the bartender. He caught it, eyed it carefully, and quirked an eyebrow as if to ask ""Are you sure?"" I shrugged, and saluted before turning out the door. It wasn't much, but cobalt was a rare mineral no matter what planet I was on. Figured it would go far in helping me stay in his good graces. Never hurt to stay on the good side of the man that served you a Black Hole that didn't suck.

""Captain, your jacket!"" said Niall, pressing it into my arms. In a fluid motion I swept it up and over my shoulders, and zipped it up to the neck. ""Thanks,"" I said, before remembering who it was I was talking to.

We walked out the door to find his friend, and a whole heap of trouble. In the middle of the street was a commotion. I looked up and down, and noticed that every merchant on the strip had either barred their doors or were suspiciously looking somewhere else. For it being basically the prime time for running errands and making deals, the street was surprisingly empty.

""Sparrow!"" cried Niall, and lunged forward. ""Easy, you idiot,"" I said through gritted teeth. I had to physically hold him back to keep him from barreling into the several larger Xenos holding a young woman off her feet by her wrists. Sparrow was as slight as her namesake, with chestnut hair and dark eyes. She was struggling to free herself, but her captors had her wings easily pinned, and her mouth covered.

""That explains the lack of a Song,"" I muttered.

""Why don't you pick on someone your own size!"" shouted Niall, still struggling against me. He was stronger than he looked, but so was I. He stayed firmly rooted in place. ""Niall,"" I said in a low voice, ""You're not their size either.""

That stopped him. He looked at his shoes, and then up at the Xenos, and said ""Oh. Yeah. I guess that's true.""

The Xenos laughed at him. Sparrow's eyes rolled, hard. Oof, she'd dealt with Niall before, I could tell. Sparrow continued to struggle, but now the gang's focus was on us. I wanted it on me. I stepped in front of Niall, and rolled the sleeves of my jacked up a twist. ""You're going to put the young woman down, and you're going to scurry off to whatever sewer you crawled out of,"" I commanded.

A Xeno with a leathery grey-blue hide, at least a head taller than his friends, took a step forward and sneered. ""And why would we do that? I bet if we plucked each feather from this bird, we could make bank. Then we could put her in a cage and sell her to the highest bidder. You got anything that'll top that? Should we find out?"" He flexed, muscles rippling under his mismatched clothes.

I took one short step forward. Niall had the good sense to stay put. I set my stance wide, hands on my hips. Then, I gave that monstrously large Xeno a hard stare. He stared back, took a confident step forward, then another step, then faltered. I slowly parted my lips, and made true the old adage ""Just because you can see my teeth, doesn't mean I'm smiling."" His own confident grin slid off his face as I tore him apart with my gaze.

""You know what, I bet we can score something better. C'mon."" He turned and started to pull away. Sparrow took that moment to give a swift kick to the knees of the grunt holding her. He buckled immediately, and then it was chaos. Sparrow was dropped like a sack of grain, but before she could hit the ground Niall caught her. The Xeno with the hurt knee was getting pulled to his feet by his gang, and the head honcho was basically sprinting down the street.

""But how? You didn't even *do* anything."" asked Niall. I turned my eyes to Sparrow and Niall. The woman shrank, but only for a moment before glaring back at me with defiance. Niall seemed unaffected. Odd. ""I just reminded them that there are things in the Realms more dangerous than them,"" I said curtly.

Sparrow started to open her mouth and I snapped. ""Not. One. Word. My ship. Now."" Her jaw clicked shut. Good. I turned on my heel and set off down the dead street. ""Hey tha.. OUCH"" I heard Niall behind me. At least one of them had the good sense to shut the hell up. We hustled on. Fortunately the bar hadn't been that far from port, so it took us less than half an hour to make it through the crowded spaceport to the Miss Piggy. There was a crowd around her loading ramp, but with all the bustle of the port I couldn't see clearly. As I got closer, I wished I hadn't come back to the ship after all.

For context: I (18f) work at a coffee shop in a very small/very popular beach tourist town. I‚Äôve been working there since March. The way that we make our coffee is that are small and medium sizes gets two shots of espresso and the large has four shots. We do offer decaf espresso drinks. We have four stations when it comes to making the drinks: cashier, Cup prep/food runner, espresso, and mixer/server. Mixer/server was where I was working this day.

Story: i‚Äôm working my usual busy shift during Fourth of July week. As I was was finishing up the entitled mother (EM) drinks, she saw me poor four shots of espresso into one of her large drinks and this is the conversation that happened after. 

(She had ordered 2 large iced caramel macchiato‚Äôs, 1 large latte with ice on the side, and one large hot Americano)

EM: ‚Äúexcuse me how much espresso did you just put in that drink?‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúour large drinks come with four shots of espresso ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

EM: ‚Äúall of the larges have four shots of espresso!? shouldn‚Äôt you advertise that shit somewhere!!? I‚Äôm a mother with two children and you expecting the drink basically 2 cups of coffee!!?‚Äù

Me: *I look behind her and see two young girls probably aged 9-12, they had each ordered two large caramel macchiatos* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôam do you want me to remake these and make these decaf so they don‚Äôt have any caffeine in it?‚Äù

EM: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know this is your job! Can you just mix one of them and put it in a smaller cup?!! I mean this is outrageous. How do you expect two little girls to finish two large coffees? I mean, this is completely insane!? Are you fucking crazy?‚Äù

At this point my shift lead (18f) who is standing next to me the whole time, and had heard the whole entire conversation, asked if everything was all right. I try to explain this situation, but the entitled mother, cut me off and rants for a bit about how incompetent I am. We decide to split one of the caramel macchiato‚Äôs just to appease her and get her moving because this commotion was making a line. 

I‚Äôm making her final drink, she‚Äôs still staring at me like I‚Äôm the devil, and I say, in my very nice customer service voice:

Me: ‚Äúhave a nice day ma‚Äôam! :D‚Äù

EM: ‚ÄúI STILL HAVEN‚ÄôT GOTTEN MY FINALLY DRINK!!‚Äù * she yells this directly in my face. as her final drink is halfway in between me and her, in my hand* 

At this point, I‚Äôve gotten a little behind on my station and I turned to finish that . She gathers her kids and her drinks and walked away. So in total she had gotten two medium caramel macchiato, her large latte, her Americano, and she took the other large caramel macchiato that she had originally ordered, which is why she was angry in the first place. so instead of walking away with her original four drinks, she got five instead. 

I just found it funny and laughed with my shift lead while she was extremely pissed on my behalf lol. I just don‚Äôt understand why she didn‚Äôt ask for this when she was talking to the cashier! We have alternatives and smaller sizes üò≠",6,1730698731.0,entitledparents,0,0.88,False

As well know, buying a coffee machine is a lengthy, and often overly reliant on other people's opinions and views, however, we're all unique and have our own preferences. 

That being said, I've recently swapped machines, from the old academia to the magenta plus, both made by Gaggia. On paper and looking at the reviews and videos, I was confident that I was doing the right thing. I was wrong. 

The magenta plus doesn't make espresso as nice as the academia, they're quite similar, but the academia wins IMO, and the professional style steam wand is very slow compared to the academia.

I feel like I'd really benefit from going to some kind of show or event, where there's multiple machines on show, all being demonstrated. Does such an even exist? If so, I'd love to attend one, preferably in the West Midlands area of the UK?

Does anyone have any suggestions please?

1gj6uz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TuscanyTourism/comments/1gj6uz2/driving_from_montepulciano_to_florence/,Driving from Montepulciano to Florence,"Planning a drive from Montepulciano to Florence? This route is a classic Tuscan experience, with stunning views, rolling hills, and charming villages along the way. Whether you‚Äôre renting a car or using your own, here‚Äôs what you need to know for a smooth trip.

**How Long is the Drive?**

The drive from Montepulciano to Florence takes around 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on traffic and any stops you make. It‚Äôs about 110 kilometres (68 miles) if you take the main highways, but trust me‚Äîthere are a few scenic routes worth checking out if you want to add a little magic to the journey.

**Scenic Routes to Consider**

If you‚Äôre not in a rush, Tuscany has some beautiful back roads that are worth exploring. Here are a couple of options:

* **Via SR2 (Via Cassia)**: This is one of the most scenic routes and lets you pass through charming towns like Pienza and San Quirico d'Orcia. The road winds through the Val d‚ÄôOrcia, known for its postcard-perfect landscapes.
* **Highway A1 (Autostrada)**: If you‚Äôre short on time, stick with the A1. It‚Äôs a toll road but much faster, taking you directly to Florence with minimal fuss.

**Tips for Driving from Montepulciano to Florence**

* **Watch for ZTLs in Florence**: Like most Italian cities, Florence has a Limited Traffic Zone (ZTL) in the city centre. Unless you‚Äôve got a permit, avoid driving into the centre to avoid fines.
* **Take a break in small towns**: Consider stopping in places like Pienza or San Quirico d‚ÄôOrcia. They‚Äôre beautiful little spots to stretch your legs and maybe grab a coffee or a quick bite.
* **Mind the speed limits**: Italy takes speeding seriously, especially on highways. Keep an eye on signs, as the limits change from town to highway stretches.
* **Fuel up in advance**: Some rural areas don‚Äôt have 24-hour petrol stations, so it‚Äôs smart to fuel up in Montepulciano before hitting the road.

**FAQs**

**Is it easy to park in Florence?** Parking can be tricky in Florence‚Äôs city centre, but there are lots outside the ZTL, like Parcheggio Fortezza Fiera. From there, you can walk or take public transport.

**Can I avoid the tolls on this route?** Yes, taking Via Cassia (SR2) avoids tolls, but it‚Äôll take a bit longer than the A1 highway.

**Where should I stop for a quick break?** Pienza and San Quirico d'Orcia are popular stops. Both are scenic and have good cafes with delicious food.

**Do I need an international driver‚Äôs permit?** Yes, if you‚Äôre from outside the EU, you'll want to have one for driving in Italy.",1,1730696893.0,TuscanyTourism,0,1.0,False

Walk to the Asakusa area, walk around browsing and get a Hojicha drink with boba ¬•850. I love hojicha which is roasted green tea so it has a nutty flavor rather than a grassy flavor like matcha. If you live near a Muji they have an instant drink mix which is where I discovered it.

Walk to Senso-ji temple and get a snack of matcha and hojicha cakes ¬•730 and fried chicken ¬•400, and a fortune ¬•100. It's a bad one, so you leave it tied to a railing there so as not to take the bad luck with you.

Walk to the Kappabashi Kitchen Tools Street and browse. The street is blocked off and thank God because packed, most stores have a sale. I get two chopsticks, two cat chopstick holders, and a mini wood square spatula ¬•1085.

I see some school kids in costumes setting up drums so I wait around for their performance. They are from a highschool and give a great performance of traditional drum songs used in battle I think? 

Head back to the hotel for a rest, then go get some glasses. I order from Owndays and get 1 pair progressive lenses and one pair of distance with snap-on sunglasses for $219.

Take the train down a few stops and walk to the Great Buddha ¬•300 and Hasedera temple ¬•400 which was my favorite so far, I love the white building and all the koi ponds and gardens. There is an overlook to the bay below that is lovely. I get two temple charms here ¬•1200?, one for my mom.

Take the train again to Enoshima and walk out to the island. It gives me Island from Spirited Away vibes. Pay for the escalators up the hill and the Sea Candle ¬•700 (really tall tower on the top of the island) and make it up right for sunset with views of Mt Fuji to one side and a beautiful almost full moon on the other.

At this point my feet and knees are killing me so I take the bus back to the mainland and stop for dinner there at a soba noodle place. I get vegetable tempura with soba and ginger ale $12.28. Head back to Tokyo and my hotel, somehow end up on the wrong train twice but get there eventually. My IC card ran out of funds so I had to top up when exiting the station ¬•1600.

I go to the Museum of History and Science ¬•630 where I learned Japan sits on 4 tectonic plates and has 10% of the world's earthquake and volcano activity. Eat lunch at the museum restaurant and get ginger pork and rice ¬•1350.

I'm heading to Ginza area today but nothing opens until 10 or 11 am so I get a iced latte and a pastry at a shop near the hotel ¬•1013

Go to Ginza 6 Mall to the rooftop with a beautiful garden and nice views of the city. Walk around and window shop at all the designer stores and visit the Muji flagship store. Bottle of water ¬•130

Head to Tsukiji fish market and get sushi lunch at Itadori Bekkan $29.56 for 7 piece chef choice menu. It's so good, the fish melts in your mouth.
Walk around the stalls and get a small pack of cocktail garnish sticks for my mom ¬•200 and another coffee ¬•650. I debate getting a melon slice but I'm still full from lunch so skip it.

Head to the Imperial Palace and gardens (Free) The Palace is closed for tours by this point so I just walk around the gardens. For Shogun fans this is the site of the former Edo Castle where Toranaga aka Tokugawa Ieyasu established his shogunate in 1608. There are only a few buildings and walls left but still cool to see. Get a Sprite ¬•130 while walking. 

Take the train to Shinjuku and go to the observatory at The Metropolitan Government building (free) for great views. Get a snack of matcha ice cream and pretzel mix ¬•730 and another water ¬•130. 

Walk around Shinjuku and through the Golden Gai area. I don't drink so I came around 6pm just to see the bars, and they are so tiny only 4-5 seats and many have cover charge or certain rules like members only or no foreigners. Try to pet some street cats but they ignore me for other people. 

I get dinner at a tiny Taiwanese place with three tables. Get fried chicken and bok choy and mushroom and oolong tea. ¬•2500 try to pay with my card but it's cash only and I only have coins left. I go find an ATM and get some bills then go back and pay. 

Head back to the hotel and get majorly lost in Shinjuku station because it is so massive with like 6 different subway lines, I walked 20 minutes to the platform and was still within the station.

Fri 10/18

Slept terrible again so going to be a lot of coffee again today. Do laundry at the hotel ¬•400 and while I wait get a coffee from the lobby, go through receipts and work on this diary, do PT exercises and stretch and pack up after laundry is done. I discover many mosquito bites on my ankles and arms, fortunately I brought itch cream so I apply that.

Check out of the hotel and take the train to Tokyo station. Get Shinkansen tickets to Hiroshima $133.77 and food and drink for the train: 3 onigiri and vegetable salad ¬•1090, caffe latte, a cup of ice, and an apple juice for ¬•550.

Arrive in Hiroshima and take the street car to my hotel and check-in. Go to the drugstore next door for Magnesium to help me sleep and insect repellant ¬• ? because I keep finding bites on me.

Head out for dinner but end up walking the wrong way so take the bus back the way I came to Yagenbori Hassh≈ç for okonomiyaki. The Hiroshima version is layers instead of mixed batter and has noodles in it so it is quite different. They cook and serve it right in front of you on the open flat top grill, so it's very hot in the restaurant plus it is 80 degrees outside. Very tasty and filling ¬•1310.
Walk back to the hotel and get more cash at an ATM.

Sat 10/19

Sleep much better, yay!

It's raining today but it's not too bad and I'm going to a museum for the morning so it should be done by the time I'm out (spoiler: it was not).

Take the bus to the Peace Memorial Museum ¬•200 and visit the exhibit, very moving obviously. It's raining pretty hard by now and as I leave there is lightning and thunder for a few seconds, a bit unsettling as I leave an atomic bomb experience.

I cave and get an umbrella at a Lawson ¬•1500 and walk to a bagel shop but they are sold out. Take the bus up to Hon Dori shopping area and get lunch at a Japanese curry place. They only have one kind and it's wild boar and pork, that almost tastes like ragu sauce, with rice and green curry sauce. Japanese curry is not spicy but very flavourful. It is soooo good. Also get a pomegranate soda. ¬•2100
Stroll around and get a pistachio bun ¬•230, and find a gourmet food shop and get a couple of apple pastry ¬•648.Visit a cat themed store called Country cat and get a small lucky cat figure ¬•1100

Head back to the hotel to drop off my bag. Take the bus up to Shukkeien Gardens ¬•260 and get rained on again (""it wasn't supposed to rain‚Äù will be inscribed on my tombstone). I'm more upset about the insect repellent I just reapplied will wash off. Anyway the garden is beautiful with lots of fish and turtles and crabs? On the walking paths.

Next, walk over to Hiroshima Castle Tower ¬•370 that was reconstructed after the bombing for a nice view of the city and mountains. The castle was used as a military camp before the war, which is one of the reasons Hiroshima was targeted. Get a quick sunset photo before the rain clouds roll in again.

Walk to get dinner at a ramen shop ¬•1200 then back to the hotel. Top up my suica card at 7/11 with ¬•5000. I've been doing smaller amounts because there is no refund given but I still have a week left so this should last me.

Sun 10/20

Check out of the hotel and make my way to Miyajima Island today and will stay the night there. Get two doughnuts and a muffin at the train station ¬•530. Eat the doughnuts while waiting for the train.

Arrive via ferry and can't check in to the hotel until 3pm, so I leave my bags there and walk around. The ropeway (basically a gondola) up the hill is closed today due to high winds, so I may hike up there later or try tomorrow.

Walk around the island main streets and get food: chicken skewer ¬•600, beef curry kare pan ¬•600 and a hojicha blended drink ¬•450. Also eat my muffin from earlier. Spot a Miyazaki gift store which is surprisingly the first one I've seen. Almost get a Kiki tote bag and socks but decided not to.

Go to the hotel to drop my bag off and my room is ready early so I take my luggage inside. It's a Japanese style room, so futon on the floor. But it has a nice enclosed balcony with chairs right on the bay. I won't need any white noise to sleep tonight, the sound of the waves is soothing. 

I decide to hike up to the top of the mountain, and it's rough. It's 535 meters or 1755 feet to the top and a 2.5 km or 1.5 mile hike. It's basically all ragged rock steps straight up, it's not a hiking path like I'm used to. But coming down I see little kids, elderly people and one guy in flip flops, so I figure if they can do it so can I. It takes me almost 2 hours with lots of rest breaks to reach the observatory at the top, there are nice views all around to the nearby islands and back to the mainland. I don't stay too long because it gets dark soon and it's an hour hike back down. I go back down the other side from where I came up, and I think it would have been much easier as there are more flat walking parts and better stairs. I talk to a couple who passed me going up and we chat a little on the walk down. 

Walk past Itsukushima Shrine on the way back and it's low tide now so people are walking out to see it. Get a lemonade drink ¬•600 and 1 refill ¬•200 and a conger eel rice plate ¬•1900 for dinner. Oysters and eel are on most menus here, but I hate oysters so don't try any.

Back at the hotel after dinner I visit the spa for a soak. There is another woman there who says she recognized me from the hike earlier so we got to chatting, she from Seattle! After a bit go back to my room for bed.

I kind of wish I stayed in Hiroshima instead of the island tonight. It's a little over an hour to get here and you can do pretty much everything in one day. Plus I have to go back to Hiroshima station in the morning to get my next train anyway.

* Food $32.13

Daily total $32.13 and 24,928 steps

Monday 10/21

Wake up not too sore from the hike but my back is from the futon. Check out of the hotel and walk to get coffee. I go to Starbucks because I need the American standard of sugar in my coffee, not the Japanese standard. Get a Pumpkin Spice Latte ¬•530 then at another shop for momiji manju, a cake shaped like the Japanese maple leaf which is a specialty here, ¬•760 for 4.

Head back to the ferry to go back to Hiroshima. I decide to stop in Hijemi on the way to visit Hijemi Castle. $62.20 for the shinkansen ticket. It leaves in less than 10 minutes so I run to the track and don't have time to grab lunch. I eat my cakes from this morning to tide me over, it's only an hour to my stop.

Arrive at Himeji station and get a sandwich and water at 7/11 ¬•530 then put my luggage in a storage locker, should be ¬•700 but I forgot something so had to unlock it again and pay twice so ¬•1400 total.

Walk to Himeji Castle or the ‚ÄúWhite Heron Castle‚Äù due to the beautiful white exterior. ¬•1050 for it and the garden next door. You take shoes off when entering the 6 story keep, which is great in my bare feet. The stairs are very steep going up and down. Spend a few hours there walking around the castle grounds and the garden. ¬•200 for ice cream. Bus back to the station then Shinkansen train to Kyoto $38.80

Arrive in Kyoto and take the bus to my hotel, get lost again but eventually find the bus. Check in to the hotel and drop my bags off. I'm starving so go out to find dinner. The first two places I wanted had long lines and the third seats me right in front of the grill and the smoke makes me cough so I leave. A few doors down I find a place with no wait so I eat there. I get a crispy pork salad which I think means the pork will be crispy, but instead they put crispy fried bits of batter on top but it's still really good. Also order scallops which I never got and ginger ale ¬•2700. I'm pretty sure they still charged me for the scallops but oh well.
Walk around the area a bit and top up my IC card ¬•2000 with all my coins.

Tues 10/22

Head out early and take the train to Fushimi Inari and get there at 7am. Begin the hike up and make it to the top in about 1 1/2hours. Lots of beautiful shrines and stops along the way. Get a post card ¬•150 and a water ¬•250 at the top. I thought there would be a view up there but it's just a shrine. There is one viewpoint about half way up where you can see south to Osaka that is nice.

Make my way back down to the train station and get a chocolate taiyaki ¬•350. At this point 3 days in a row of hiking up things has gotten to me, so I go back to the hotel and take a bath. My room also has a massage chair so I sit in that and rest for a bit. 
For lunch I aim towards Nishiki market but come across a cute noodle shop so eat there instead. I get a duck and mushroom pasta and green tea ¬•1990. I also get a Fuji apple ¬•250 at a corner shop because I haven't had a piece of fruit since I've been here.

Go to the market and get 2 kinds of furikake, a yuzu and a plum for ¬•960. A sock stall has compression socks I stop to look at for a moment and the sales lady sucks me in. I end up getting just those ¬•1200.Walk to a tea store I wanted to visit but they are closed today so I get a hojicha drink nearby ¬•550. I come across a second hand clothing store so I go in and get a cool button up sweater $29.57. I'm much more drawn to the men's clothing shops here for some reason.

Walk to the Nintendo Store in a nearby shopping mall but it's pretty small. The Switch price is about $40 cheaper than the US, maybe because of the exchange rate? I don't get one though.On the way back down I browse the floors and get some Yuzu scented lotion ¬•2200.

Head to another tea store Ginza Tsujiri and get some hojicha tea bags as well as the seasonal special tsubokiri cha in a couple different varieties $17.03Walk back to my hotel along the river and eat my apple. I will keep it low key the rest of the day, probably only go out for dinner nearby. 

Get dinner at a burger place ¬•1738 for a cheese burger, fries, and ginger ale that had fun disco music playing. Still wanting fruit I go to a grocery store but it must be a fancy one because 1 apple is ¬•800 and grapes are ¬•1900. Leave that one and go to another by my hotel much cheaper. I get 3 apples, a package of dried peaches and seaweed flavor potato chips for ¬•783

Wed 10/23

Go out early to Arashiyama area to see the bamboo forests. Get there at 8 am and it's not too bad. There is a nice overlook over the canyon and river. Walk around the area for an hour then take the bus to Ryoanji temple ¬•600. This one is small and simple but has a nice pond and zen rock garden. There is also a display of panels with dragon paintings from the former Prime Minister. It's a little busy with some tour groups there too. Get two small coffees and a water ¬•400 while I'm there. Next take the bus to Kinkakuji temple ¬•500, and holy mother is it packed here. Lots of school groups and tour groups. Other than the golden temple there's not much here so a little disappointed.

Take the bus back towards the city center and get sushi for lunch. Get a Kaisen Don which is a variety of fish in a rice bowl ¬•1500. The chef has a little globe where I put a pin in where I'm from, so cute! I go back to my hotel to lay down and charge my phone. I brought a power bank but no cable, so helpful. 

I booked an English tour at the Katsura Imperial Villa for late afternoon so I head over there. You have to apply for entry with your passport for a specific date and time, ¬•1000. The Imperial family don't visit that often so it's like visiting Sandringham in Scotland, but only on the grounds.

After the tour ends I take the bus back towards the city center. Stop at the Aeon Mall Gojo because why not. There is a grocery store on the first floor so I browse around. I'm pretty sure I'm getting my period early and soon so I get a small pack of tampons and a matcha pudding on sale for ¬•401.

On the bus again and I find a restaurant near my hotel called Coltrane that does curry and plays jazz. I get a pork loin curry with spinach and a ginger ale ¬•1810. Top up my IC card ¬•2000. Go back to my room and eat an apple and call it a night.

Thurs 10/24

Pack up and check out of my hotel and leave my luggage. Take the bus up north where I get a pumpkin bagel with pumpkin spice cream cheese that has nuts in it, and they serve it with potato chips? The bagels are smaller and a little tough but still good overall. Also get an iced latte ¬•980. I've come to learn that an iced latte here is just espresso/coffee and milk, so I add gum syrup (liquid sugar). 

Next I go to the Botanical Gardens ¬•200 for my last stop in Kyoto. There are still lots of blooms, wild flowers and roses. There are lots of school kids here ranging from pre-school to teenagers drawing or painting the flowers. Visit the conservatory for ¬•200 with all the tropical plants. Get lunch at the cafe and there is a wait so I get a pizza and drink for takeout ¬•2070. It takes about 30 minutes but it's actually really good, Neapolitan style that I like and they have a wood fire oven. 

Take the bus back to the hotel to get my bags then take the Shinkansen to Tokyo $93.91. I should have gotten a ticket to the Shinagawa station because it's on the south side of Tokyo same as my hotel, but oh well.

I'm staying in the Shibuya area for my last couple of days in Tokyo, so I take the subway to my new hotel and check in. The room is right next to train tracks and I hear them go by every 5 minutes. I ask to switch rooms and there is one across the hall but still on the same side. It's a little better so hopefully I can sleep tonight.
I got back up to Akihabara to pick up my glasses. I stop at a corner store for a big haul of Kit Kat flavors and some sunscreen for $49.41. I can't open them while I'm in Japan or I lose the tax savings.

There is a highly rated ramen shop that does it with lobster a little ways away so I head there but it's an hour wait, no thank you. I go to a yakitori shop a few doors down and get a chicken thigh skewer, a mushroom skewer, edamame and a ginger ale ¬•1200. I'm not brave enough to try the other chicken parts like neck meat, coccyx or gizzard.

Head back to Shibuya area and stop at Uniqlo before they close for underwear. I have enough clean pants and tops for the next two days but need clean underwear. I had to throw away 2 pairs that I brought, so I get two pairs of period panties for $26.38. I think that's about the price I paid for one of the Thinx that I threw away.

Friday 10/25

No real plans today other than exploring Harajuku Cat Street. Nothing opens until 11 (even bakeries and coffee shops!) so I get a matcha latte at an open cafe ¬•700. 

Go to the On shoe store because my shoes are on their last leg. There is a huge line to enter the store? We line up the stairs to wait to get in, it takes me about 40 minutes to enter, then have to wait on the 1st floor again. Finally get to see the shoes and I eventually get to try on a pair, you have to wait for an employee to get your size for you. I almost get them but the longer I walk around one starts to rub my ankle so I leave the shoes. If you do end up buying you leave them with an employee then go back to the 1st floor to buy them from a different employee on their phone. They would be about $25 cheaper but they don't do tax free. Probably the worst designed store experience I've ever been in. 

A few doors down I see and smell BBQ so I go in to see how it is. They do BBQ plates and everything but I just get a pulled pork sandwich $11.73. I ask to sit outside because it's really hot in the restaurant. Browse around the shops on Cat Street and visit The Matcha Tokyo for A matcha lemonade and matcha cookie which I think has chocolate chips but are actually cranberries, still good though $7.91.

Since I didn't get any shoes I decided to get another pair of glasses, so I go to the Owndays in Shibuya. I get a green pair with green snap on sunglasses $85.67. I tried to get the black sun lenses but you can't mix and match I guess. While I'm waiting for them I go to the nearby Mega Don Quijote and get 2 more sunscreen, peach kit Kats and a chocolate matcha drink mix I tasted in the store $21.67.
Go back and pick up my glasses, because the store is in a mall I have to do the tax free counter and wait with everyone else. I think half my day has been spent waiting in line. I check in for my flight tomorrow while I wait. I end up waiting 40 minutes for $7.88 refund.

Walk back to my hotel and drop off my stuff. Go to a restaurant down the road from my hotel and get fried scallops, a croquette of potato and ground beef I think, gyoza and ginger ale ¬•1903. It all ends up being fried food but at least there is cabbage salad as well.

When I was walking around earlier I saw a garden terrace on top of a building so I find it again and go up there. It has 3 levels with lots of seating and a food court, and nice views of the area. I chill there for a bit then walk back to the hotel.

Saturday 10/26

Pack up my bags and check out of the hotel. I have a couple of hours until I need to leave for the airport so I go to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden ¬•500 and walk around. The flowers are mostly gone but the trees and greenhouse are nice. Get a bento lunch of fried chicken and mackerel and a lemonade $13.54. 

Go back to the hotel to get my bags then take the train to the airport. When getting my Skyliner ticket it won't take my credit card so I use my IC and top up ¬•1000 with my last bill to pay for the fare ¬•1800? When I get to Narita airport I have to top up again but don't have enough coins so go to an ATM and get another ¬•10000 to top up the IC with ¬•1000. I think I'm left with ¬•500 on the card, so pretty good. I will exchange the rest of the money when I get back home. 

Go through security and they confiscate my bug spray and yuzu lotion, sad‚Ä¶.Customs is easy I just scan my passport at the tax free machine and the immigration gates with no wait there. Getting hungry again so I look for food, can only find duty free shops so have to walk all the way to the end of the terminal and get a salmon onigiri, sweet potato chips and cheese crisps for ¬•900. 

Land at SFO and go through customs, I have Global Entry so it's quick, and wait for my bag. Recheck my bag and go through security, quick again. Get a coffee and immediately have sticker shock, $7 for a cold brew!! Forgot to exchange my money when I landed so will check at PDX. 

Land at PDX and check Lyft prices home, not too bad so I take that home. The currency exchange is closed on weekends, of course. Get home and the cat is happy to see me I think? He is purring and licks me a little so I think so.

Anyway!  

Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 39/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of CoD from time to time. 

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

1gj6lvg,https://i.redd.it/spymx58qftyd1.jpeg,A official Agnu the good catfish wizard lore post (1/???),"(Image somewhat related to this)

The streets are always lively, as a gentle breeze carries some of the sea‚Äôs sweetness alongside it, as the day was somewhat cloudy as the clouds were nice, not too hot or too cold, but yet still having that autumn sense.

People chatting, going about their daily lives, as Agnu sits on a cafes outdoor seating, taking a sip of his drink reading a therapists book, Agnu is just being himself as a large crowd of people walk past and soon the wind was more coldly, maybe a unexpected breeze, yet a chairs legs scrape along the stone ground as someone sits down, wearing a buttoned up black trench coat, black gloves, a dark gray scarf, and a hat that conveniently covers their face.

As Agnu takes another sip of his coffee, unbothered by this, the figures essence was easy to understand-

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice day‚Äù in a polite tone.

Agnu simply takes another sip from his drink, as he puts a bookmark in his book, closing it as he sets it down on the table.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù

Agnu just smiles, and gives a quick stroke of his wizard's beard.

‚ÄúYet, why are you here?‚Äù A polite tone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice time to spend a nice day, I got plans later with some of my pals.‚Äù

Once more a gray cold wind passes by, as a crowd still walks by Agnu and this person, with Agnu taking another sip from his drink, as a specific watch still ticks.

‚ÄúSo you like to run?‚Äù A polite tone, with a polite smile.

‚ÄúYeah, as well laugh at something, wanna know what I laugh at?‚Äù

The person slightly smiles, taking a drink from a cup of tea, as the breeze still has a gray tint, as the parade of people still pass by walking endlessly, as the clouds stay still, as Agnu‚Äôs watch still ticks along the path of ever passing time, as Agnu smiles, with the figure responding in a calmly coldly polite tone.

‚ÄúOh I do know, Mr Agnu.‚Äù

The figure takes another sip from their tea, and cracks their neck.

‚ÄúYour laughter makes my spine tickle, giving me and my type an itch that can never be scratched.‚Äù

The figure sets down their tea on the table, as the figure fixes their scarf, still smiling as Agnu looks at his watch, and somewhat sits up.

‚ÄúWell wanna know-‚Äú

‚ÄúOh I already know, but I wanna ask you a question, what do you know about me?‚Äù

Agnu sits back, as he narrows his eyes at the figure, taking a sip of his drink.

‚ÄúYou are wearing a fine-ish buttoned up trench coat which I‚Äôm guessing is water resistant, a fine cap to keep important facial features hidden, gloves to keep your hands warm, and a scarf for extra warmth, with your tone being one of politeness, yet still cold as the rain at a funeral.‚Äù

The figure slightly chuckles while taking a sip of their tea, as Agnu continues on.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing you attend places that are cold and rainy that are more northern, as well you appear out of the blue mainly at funerals, so you are a public consciousness representative of a grim reaper.‚Äù 

The people still pass continuously, as Agnu still sits at a ready moment to do what he does, the watch still ticking at a pace, with Agnu looking at it.

‚ÄúJust noticed your watch is acting‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúWeird, weird just how you appear here, because even though you are a public consciousness of a grim reaper, you are still a veteran in your line of work, one that does not have a peculiar pantheon or afterlife, essentially a freelancer for the business of death.‚Äù

The figure chuckles once again, as they stand up and crack their knuckles, as the winds are still cold and gray as the never floating clouds, the figure still smirking, looking at Agnu.

‚ÄúHuh, you know your stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell you made it so obviously knowable, the fact that there's a constant stream of people walking past us, and a quick glance at them, a good chunk with suits and such on, some religious stuff as well, they sleep in coffins, cremated, and such.‚Äù

The figure laughs, the passed people still endlessly march along past both, the realm around them still gray and cold, as the figure stretches.

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôve always been a more forwards type of reaper, so now I will ask, **What time is it?**‚Äù

Agnu gets up from his seat, stretching as well, and taps his watch, with a smile.

‚ÄúWell you see, It's Agnu Time!‚Äù

With the famous line said, Agnu does what he does and he proceeds to Agnu all over the place, as the figure still stands there, slowly laughing as they watch Agnu as he Agnu‚Äôs all over the place, soon after a bit of catfish tomfoolery Agnu bolts around, making mental notes of the people he pass, knowing that he‚Äôs been teleporting somewhere, yet Agnu ain‚Äôt concerned in the slightest, as he runs about around this gray cold realm, even though he‚Äôs not on home turf, Agnu knows that he is speed‚Äî

Yet Agnu feels something impact, a cold grasp overcoming him as he soon tumbles to the stone road and scuffs against the ground, as the figure stands there, with a long smile along their face, as a faint drizzle of a cold gray water begins to fall and splat along the ground.

‚ÄúWell you can run, that‚Äôs for certain, but I heard you were faster.‚Äù

Agnu narrows his eyes, picking himself up as speed still flows along him, beginning to charge up and immediately pounces backwards as two dark spikes tear through the ground, as the figure holds both of their hands out.

‚ÄúCosmicus and Falce, we have a challenge.‚Äù

The figure's clothing slowly melts into a dark substance, as it distorts and reforms into a dim black armor, a faint darken lighting runs around them, as the spikes fly towards the figure and get attached to their feet, as they turn around, the dark cold gray rain flows along their armor.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you really are the fastest catfish.‚Äù 

This to Agnu, was, was, it was great, someone else that was fast like him, someone else that could challenge him like Hastur, as Agnu feels his heart to beat, feeling the speed beginning to charge and flow more fast, the rain slowly flowing, his watch to slowly tick, time in this realm between these two begins to slow down.

As the rain seemingly stopped mid fall, the watches hands seemingly stopped, both speedsters locking eyes, that same flint of speed that runs with them, as the cold gray realm around them freezes to a slow halt, and before someone could even snap their fingers, a burst of light rings out, the rain around them temporarily dispersed, yet-

*crunch*

It was loud and audible, the sheer force that was expelled should have caused a chain reaction but yet.

*Tick* 

A tick of something resumes time around them, the cold gray rain is dispersed, windows crack and shatter, the ground trembles, and blood is splattered along the ground as the figure stands there somewhat dissatisfied with this.

‚Äú3‚Ä¶ 2.. 1.‚Äù

Agnu stands but wobbly, blood dripping from him, his eyes wobbly, he can feel every second return to him, every single agonizing microscopic crack that stretch along his ribs, as the blood flows through to only leave from the impact, as the figures armor shifts once again.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go on a jog, shall we?‚Äù

The figures armor gauntlet shifts as claws eject from it as they pierce, Agnu who only is able let out a sharp cry of pain, and before being able to get anything else out, Agnu is barely able to process being ruthlessly dragged along the ground, through walls, through buildings, through trees, through anything, nothing could withstood the ruthlessness of the figures speed, the only trace is Agnu‚Äôs blood along the shattered and tearing ground.

As Agnu tries his best to fight back, trying to throw some punches but he can‚Äôt feel his left arm, he can barely move his right arm, he can feel the skin on his back being skinned by the ground, he can‚Äôt even manage to make a noise, yet his catfish immortality should have kicked in, he should have respawned at least ten or fourteen times by now, but he hasn‚Äôt, he can feel everything and yet nothing at the same time, he can see every micro detail and not, he can feel every breeze yet he cannot.

As Agnu can barely see the figure, only seeing a deep dark abyss of a silhouette, he can still feel the claws digging and twisting around in him, blood constantly streaming from it, illuminating the claws as they stay put in him, Agnu is still trying to move anything and yet coming up short as he slams through trees, against the forest floors, along the rugged rocks and through a river, and by now Agnu was sure that catfish immortality should have activated by at least a high double digit number.

But it hasn‚Äôt and yet he is still alive, as Agnu is lifted up and his back broken against a tree's branches and soon feeling rugged rock against his back, as the figure looks on with those beaming green eyes, as the figure lets out another laugh.

‚ÄúYou can die and face no repercussions of death, you have stated you **Laugh in the face of death**‚Äù

As Agnu gets violently crushed into a couple of mountains, leaving a sizable crater and yet blood is barely shedding from him, he‚Äôs lost too much, as the necrotic lightning jolts around the figure, the feeling of dread surrounds them.

‚Äú**SO LAUGH IN MY FACE!**‚Äù 

As the figure violently rips out their clawed hand from Agnu, dried catfish blood stain the class as they flick it of the blood, as the figure still looms over Agnu, the necrotic lightning twisting around the clawed hand, soon the armor shifts and melts into resembling a fish hook, one that can pierce any fish, mainly a catfish, as the figure looks at the beating and broken catfish, as Agnu can only manage scared breathing.

‚ÄúFucking pathetic.‚Äù

As the figure grasps Agnu using their left hand, as they look into the catfish‚Äôs eyes, so blue as a lake, and without hesitation they pierce the catfish straight through the chest, it‚Äôs evident on the catfish‚Äôs face they wanna make a noise, yet he can only barely move his mouth, as the fish hook only twists and turns in the catfish, making sure it has a good grasp on the catfish, a cold dead grasp, one of a reaper.

As the air around them soon begins to colden, the world slowly grays, the color drains, as the figure emits that necrotic lightning around them, as the lightning twirls and twists around the figure and the broken catfish, and envelopes them within a dark burst of abyss.

>For quite a while, I've been going to this coffee shop nearby, and oftentimes, there'd be the same girl taking my order and making my coffee. I am overall a pretty friendly person, so I'd often strike up a conversation with her about whatever. Well, today, after getting my usual coffee order, we were chatting for a bit longer than usual. (Later, I found out the reason why we were talking a bit longer than usual was because she'd mess up my coffee on purpose and then offer to remake it so we could chat longer.) At the end of our conversation, she very smoothly goes, ""I hope it's not weird, but can I get your number?""  
I am happy as hell. I thought this only happens in movies. I happily gave her my number and went to call my friend to talk about this right afterward. Didn't even finish my coffee, lol.

The initial post blew up in the way that I didn't expect, and knowing that she used reddit I deleted the post to not sell my game of over-excitement (on the odd chance she'd see it).

A lot of people on that post have been asking me for an update, and I figured I should finally give one. Well, we are dating! We've gone on multiple dates since then (with the first one being the day of her asking me for my number, actually), and now we are officially together. Feels really cool, turns out we share quite a bit of mutual interests and we are doing pretty well. Now whenever she works I come in and we pass each other cute notes/drawing.

When the interview was coming to an end the mangers handed us all papers to write when/what time we could be available to work. Before leaving, one of the mangers asked if I wanted a drink since the others got some before the interview and I said no with a smile because I would feel bad for wasting his money. After the interview which I assumed lasted about an hour I left the store feeling nervous. I started feeling insecure because the others being interviewed seemed to have work experience while I don't. This is my first time applying for a job and my first interview so I am new to everything. I applied because I love coffee, socializing, and I'm open to new things. The manger said that they will reach out to us (Give us a email) in a few days and now I'm starting to worry and overthink it since it's Nov 3. My mom says I'm overreacting and that they will probably send a email in about 2-5 days or 1 week but I'm still nervous. My sister says 1 month. I have been constantly checking my emails.

Hi there! I know this community often shares stories of online connections turning into real-life relationships, but I find myself in the opposite situation and could use some advice.

A few months back, in late July, I matched with a woman on Tinder while she was on vacation in my town. We hit it off immediately when we met for coffee, spending nearly three hours talking. There was no awkwardness; we explored each other‚Äôs lives, cultures, and careers. We discovered we both work in computing, share similar backgrounds (she‚Äôs from a neighboring country to my father‚Äôs), and both love traveling and learning languages.

She‚Äôs fluent in Arabic, French, and English, while I‚Äôm learning Arabic and Spanish. I found it adorable when she would blush and fumble for words in English, often switching to French when she got flustered. I complimented her a few times, and while she thanked me, she admitted she wasn‚Äôt used to receiving compliments, which I understood given her cultural background.

After coffee, we exchanged numbers and squeezed in a quick lunch before she had to fly home. We talked about her vacation, and I told her I wanted to take her out for dinner when she returned, to which she happily agreed.

Since she returned home, we‚Äôve been texting every few days. She often sends me video reels showcasing different parts of my country, and I respond by saying I‚Äôll take her there someday. In return, she shares reels from her home, and I playfully asked, ‚ÄúAre you trying to tempt me to visit?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúHaha, yes‚Ä¶ you caught me. You won‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù We chat about random things and just keep up with each other.

I‚Äôve thought about her a lot over the past few months, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt been so reserved towards her. I constantly grapple with how I could make a relationship work if she feels the same way.

	‚Ä¢	Distance: While there‚Äôs a significant distance, I work remotely and am in a good financial position due to real estate investments. I could travel to see her, and she‚Äôs mentioned she could see herself living in my country someday.
	‚Ä¢	Cultural Connection: She is Muslim, and while I believe in God, I don‚Äôt currently follow a religion. However, I‚Äôve developed a strong interest in my culture and have been learning about Islam this year, envisioning it playing a significant role in my future.
	‚Ä¢	Her Situation: Given her being quite private, there‚Äôs a chance she may not even be single anymore, especially after three months.

I want to express my feelings to her and find out if she has any romantic interest in me. Our relationship has been more of a friendship with some light flirting, but I‚Äôm unsure how to approach this.

Any advice on how I should proceed would be really appreciated.

To preface, service dogs in training in my state have the exact same public access right as fully trained service dogs. That means anywhere a service dog can go, a service dog in training can also go. Second, legally service dogs do not have to wear identifying gear. 

So anyways, a couple of days ago I woke up and realized I was out of coffee at home. I‚Äôm one of those people who basically can‚Äôt function in the mornings without coffee. I decided to go to a local coffee shop and take my service dog in training with me. I was honestly too tired to put his vest on and since it‚Äôs not legally required, I decided to forgo it. 

The coffee shop had a sign out front saying ‚ÄúNo Pets Allowed. Service Dogs Welcome.‚Äù No problem right? He‚Äôs an SDiT with hundred of hours of training. 

I went in, ordered my coffee, and sat down. Pretty quickly one of the staff came over and said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no pets allowed in here.‚Äù I explained that he‚Äôs not a pet, he‚Äôs a service dog in training. The employee got upset with me and was demanding to know why he wasn‚Äôt wearing a vest and why I didn‚Äôt tell them when I walked in that he‚Äôs a service dog.

On our first coffee date he said he was open to any type of connection, including friends ( I don't remember the exact word). We went on an absolutely wonderful 2nd date that he set up. He pulled out all the stops. But there was never anything romantic or flirty or sexy during that date. Which i was relieved about, since I had decided he was too old for me. I'm still pretty active, but he is not. He moves older than he is. Sort of shuffles along. But a great interesting guy. But at the end of the date he kissed me on the mouth. 

I had lunch with him a week or so later. I didn't dress up, no makeup. And I said I really enjoyed his company, but I didn't think there was a romantic connection. And that on our first date he was open to any relationship, and that I'd like to be friends. He seemed ok with that, and told me he Really liked me. 

Then I went on vacation. When I got back he sent a text that wasn't real clear, but said he felt I didn't have time for him (I'm not retired, he is) and that he wished me well. I waited , then responded that I enjoyed his friendship and was sad, but if that's what he felt best I wished him well. 

He wrote back that he liked my text, and it was ok if we met again. (Not his exact words). So a week or two later we had lunch again. I thought we were being friends, but he kissed me again and told me he liked me 'really a lot' . I feel like he's not really hearing me. So I was clearer when we said goodbye. Now I feel shitty because he's a sweet man, probably really missing his wife (I don't think he's overall lonely, he is always doing something with his daughters and grandkids). And I'm trying to be friends and instead I'm kinda rejecting him. He doesn't deserve that.

I want to reach out and tell him again he is a great guy. But I think that will just make matters worse. Is there anything I can do to be supportive without leading him on?",6,1730695496.0,datingoverfifty,7,0.81,False

Wondering if I will be able to break lease as the landlord as provided unlivable conditions for me.  I work from home and require multiple screens to do my work since I am in data analystics, so I can‚Äôt realistically work from a coffee shop on one screen. 

I rented an apartment starting October 1 and signed a 1 year lease. Within, two days of moving in they started construction by gutting 2 units right next to mine. Between approx 8:30 and 6 PM  for the last month, all day there was a maintenance dude cutting pipe for plumbing, framing walls, hanging drywall etc etc. The trailer he was working out of was directly outside of my window. The stair well was consistently covered in drywall dust, fiberglass insulation, an unknown oil based liquid (it took days to dry on the wooden stairs), etc etc. That project just came to an end.  I have pictures/video/audio of the sawing , banging, mess, and a gigantic loud front loader parked directly outside my window. For reference, I can hear a conversation from my apartment with the windows closed so it gets very loud. 

I have had to spend all day away from my apartment and working from my laptop. My work has suffered and it‚Äôs been a big inconvenience for me especially since I have a cat at home that is used to spending all day with me. Since the noise, I cannot conduct meeting and successfully complete work during normal business hours. 

Come to find out, they are redoing all the hvac in all of the units around me. From 8 am onward , all day long they are cutting lines for the hvac, going into attic, operating a giant lift that is very noisy etc etc. There is no end in sight for this. I am considering just paying Novembers rent and just telling them, hey this isn‚Äôt working out due to the cited reasons and this will be my last month kind of thing. 

I have verbally complained about this. They said they can find me another unit, but honestly these apartments are terribly built, dingey, and I fear the my will put me in another situation as I‚Äôve had the last month. All for just 2k a month! I don‚Äôt think that sounds unreasonable but I do understand contracts are legally binding, however, the failure to provide me ‚Äúquiet enjoyment‚Äù (I‚Äôm not a lawyer but I do have Google lol) has been egregious.

1gj6bd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gj6bd5/i_think_i_finally_found_my_friends_killer/,I think I finally found my friend's killer,"Two years ago, my best friend, Maggie, vanished.

One night, she was out with friends celebrating finals being done, laughing, living, just a college kid letting off steam. And the next morning? Gone. She was driving home to visit her parents for the weekend. Her car was found empty on a remote highway just outside of Meridian, Idaho, miles from town.

The police combed the area, but their conclusion was maddening.

***‚ÄúShe'd been drinking with friends. We know that much. Something happened on the road. She stopped. Went looking for help and probably ended up succumbing to nature.‚Äù***

Maggie probably had a drink or two after finishing finals... But no way she was drunk driving, if that's what they were insinuating. That wasn't Maggie.

Then one of the idiots even suggested she‚Äôd just taken off, like she‚Äôd decided on a whim to leave her life behind. But I knew Maggie. I knew she would never just disappear.

I knew something had happened to her. Something dark.

The police haven't made any progress and consider Maggie's case cold. I feel terrible for her and her family. Every time I pressed the police, I'd get the same tired answer.

***‚ÄúThese things happen sometimes...‚Äù***

I knew better.

Maggie didn‚Äôt just wander off, and neither did the two other college kids who‚Äôd vanished over the past five years after nights of partying, found only by their abandoned cars along these lonely mountain roads. Someone was out there, lurking, and if no one else was going to do anything about it, then I would.

Or I guess I'd try my best...

When my grandma passed away earlier this year, she left me an inheritance.

It wasn‚Äôt a fortune, but it was enough to change my life. Enough that I could take a break from work, enough that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about paying rent for a while. Enough to make a difference. I could‚Äôve put it toward something practical, something responsible, but what good would that do when my best friend was still missing and the police weren‚Äôt even trying?

There was no better way to spend it than to find Maggie‚Äôs killer.

So, I put the money to use.

I bought five used cars at a local auction, all different models, different colors, all registered with different plates. I outfitted each with a dash cam on the front and back, and made each car as inconspicuous as possible.

My goal was simple: make myself look like a random college kid on the road each night, and hope that I could draw him out. I‚Äôd change my appearance too... wigs, hats, glasses.

I needed to blend in. I needed to look like an easy target.

For months, I drove that damned mountain road.

I mapped out a pattern from all the disappearances I could track, finding the routes where people had vanished while driving them alone in the dead of night.

Five nights a week, I was there, just waiting for him to follow me. I imagined what I would do when I caught him, how I‚Äôd turn the tables and make him face the consequences once I got him on camera.

But tonight, as I sat on the edge of the lonely highway, at 3 a.m., waiting in the black Toyota Camry I‚Äôd picked up, all I felt was exhaustion. The kind of tired that sits behind your eyes and digs in.

Too many nightmares, too many nights lying awake, feeling the weight of everything pressing in. Part of me thought about skipping it tonight, but I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt risk missing him. I climbed into the car, threw a thermos of coffee onto the passenger seat, and set off.

The road was empty, silent. The only sounds were the hum of the engine and the occasional rustle of branches in the breeze. I followed my usual route, the same one Maggie would have taken home that last night. For the first hour, there was nothing. Just empty darkness stretching ahead and behind. But then, just as I was about to turn back, I noticed headlights in the rearview mirror.

My pulse raced.

Cars sometimes popped up on this road, but not often.

And this one felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

I tried to ignore the sense of dread building in my chest, telling myself it was just another driver, but my instincts wouldn‚Äôt let it go. The car was too close, its headlights glaring in my mirrors, keeping an unnerving distance.

I slowed down, just a little, just to see.

The car behind me slowed too, matching my pace perfectly. A chill crawled up my spine, but I kept my expression calm, my hands steady on the wheel. This was it. This had to be it.

I eased off the gas, letting my speed drop even further, almost to a crawl. If they wanted to pass, they‚Äôd have their chance. But they didn‚Äôt. They stayed right behind me, hanging back just far enough that I couldn‚Äôt make out the make or model of the car.

The seconds dragged on, my heartbeat loud in my ears.

I told myself to reach for my phone, to start recording from my POV as well, but my hands were frozen. I was too scared. I kept my eyes on the road, feeling my pulse thundering in my temples.

And then, just as suddenly as they‚Äôd appeared, the headlights veered off onto a side road, disappearing into the trees. I let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôd been holding, feeling the tension drain from my body. Relief washed over me, followed by a sickening disappointment.

Maybe it wasn‚Äôt him. Maybe I was just scaring myself.

I pulled over at a small turnout, resting my forehead against the steering wheel, my eyes stinging with exhaustion. My mind raced with doubts, questions, anger. What if I was wasting my time? What if Maggie was truly lost to something I could never find?

The world was silent, pressing in on me, but I forced myself to take a deep breath and close my eyes, just for a moment. I thought I‚Äôd rest for a few minutes, clear my head.

Then the sound of gravel crunching snapped me awake.

I looked up, heart pounding, to see headlights creeping up behind me. My blood ran cold as I recognized the car. It was the same one, back again. They‚Äôd been watching, waiting. I felt a surge of fear and anger as the driver‚Äôs door opened, and a figure stepped out, a tall, stocky man in a white shirt.

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He was sprinting toward me, his steps heavy and determined.

Panic took over, and I fumbled with the keys, my fingers trembling as I jammed them into the ignition. The engine roared to life, and I slammed on the gas, the tires spinning on the gravel before gripping. I shot forward, the headlights disappearing behind me as I sped down the road. In the rearview mirror, I saw him standing there, his face twisted in anger or disappointment. I couldn‚Äôt tell which. But I‚Äôd seen that look before, on other men, other nights. The look of a predator who had just lost his prey.

My hands were shaking as I drove, adrenaline flooding my veins, my mind a whirlwind of fear and fury. I‚Äôd been so certain I was in control, that I could outsmart him. But in that moment, I realized how wrong I‚Äôd been. I‚Äôd been playing with fire, and it almost consumed me.

I kept driving, my eyes darting to the rearview mirror every few seconds, half-expecting to see those headlights reappear. But the road remained empty, stretching out ahead of me like an endless, dark tunnel. It was only when I reached the lights of Meridian that I finally pulled over, my entire body shaking as I gripped the wheel.

I sat there in silence, staring into the darkness.

He and I were the only customers in a coffee shop, and I guess I looked pretty down because he asked me if I was doing okay. Uncharacteristically of me, instead of playing it off as me being tired or just preoccupied, I said that it was a rough week.  He nodded and said that he hoped things get better. He was sitting at the table next to me, and after a few minutes, to break the silence, I asked him how his day was going. He said that he was recently retired and that he‚Äôs lived alone for quite a few years now, and while I can‚Äôt exactly remember word-for-word what he said after that, he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really get around to much nowadays, but when your best days and your hardest days are behind you, everything else is just about filling the time.‚Äù

Eventually I needed to leave, and I thanked him for chatting with me. I didn‚Äôt really think of it in the moment, but sometimes the thought about his comment lingers.",5,1730694546.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

There is a barista championship with so many teams participating. They judge on speed as well as quality. This is pretty intense - I think there are YouTube videos you can watch.

There were a lot of equipment sellers too. I generally prefer medium-dark roasts with chocolatey notes for my coffee. I occasionally delve into floral/fruity notes. My purchases are reflective of that.",6,1730693943.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.88,False

I believe he was like a virgin of some sorts and he loses his virginity at the end of the movie in a plane bathroom. There‚Äôs also this memorable song in the movie (come down - Carey Adam‚Äôs head) if it‚Äôs any help. I also have a screenshot with some songs in the movie and it has timestamps I believe.
