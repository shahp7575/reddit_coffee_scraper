Our job is in daycare. I've been working at the location longer than anyone else has, but it has never gotten this bad. All my coworkers do nowadays is sit on the table and go on their phones and talk to each other, while the children play in different areas. I am normally the one having to go to the area in the back to watch them, that's fine I guess, they have an eye on the children in the front.

However lately they've been ordering coffee, without asking if I want any. I am the only one in the shift that doesn't get asked if I want any. It just seems very rude to me?? Like yea, I'm in the back, but I can still see the coffee in the office... they openly leave it in the office where I can see it. They've done this before already too, I asked them once why I didn't get offered any, they didn't respond.

Guys, what am I doing wrong? I get that I'm not very social person, but isn't it still common curtesy to ask?? I understand it's just a workplace, but regardless my feelings got hurt, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.",1,1756275430.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

It has been a rough road, and we have had a lot of bad history with breaking of trust and lying. A few months ago he lied about something and as I continued to question about it over weeks he continued to lie until I finally got the truth out of him. I am tired of the lying. He says he will truly work on himself and be honest and from what I can tell he has. He treats me so well outside of this. I am so comfortable with him, he is so kind and patient with me, and I can fully be myself around him. I know we’re young but I can see a future with him despite our rough history. Our sexual life hasn’t been great for about a year and we don’t have sex as often as I or him want even after talking about it several times. He dropped out of college and works at a coffee shop and I feel like he doesn’t have any direction in life, I know we are only 21 and figuring things out but I wish he was more ambitious. Yesterday at work I met a guy who I was instantly attracted to and clicked with. I only worked with him for about 30 minutes but it was like everything that is missing from my current relationship was there. He ended up asking for my number and I told him I have a boyfriend but I have not been able to stop thinking about him since meeting him and it caused me to feel so much doubt in my relationship. I’ve been on many dates (before my bf) and never in my life met someone and instantly clicked with them like that, not even my current boyfriend or friends. Is this just a question of the grass being greener on the other side?",1,1756275427.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1n19dvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1n19dvm/help_me_understand/,Help Me Understand,"I struggled with chronic insomnia throughout most of high school but didn't really struggle after that aside from every now and then, but in this last month it's been bad. I don't get what could be causing it this time at all either. During high school, I was drinking energy drinks and coffee all the time so I definitely think that was the reason for it, but I have long quit that habit. Even if I do have caffeine, I am not having over 80 milligrams and I don't have it after 12. The biggest issue this time is that I feel like I can fall asleep around 11:30 or 12, but that will guarantee that I won't be falling asleep until at least 3 the next night. I can never get 2 nights in a row of good sleep. I'm never sleeping in either. I always wake up somewhere from 8 to 9. Some nights I'll trick myself into thinking that sleeping meds will help, but they never do. They just make me significantly more tired the next day, but even being tired doesn't guarantee that I'll actually be able to sleep. I just don't get why this is happening this time. I workout and do cardio most days, so it's not like I'm not using any energy throughout the day. I really don't want this to become a chronic issue again because insomnia has always been the start of a downward spiral for me mentally that just makes every other problem so much worse, which in turn makes sleeping much harder than it already is. And I can't handle hearing my iron deficient girlfriend who can fall asleep at any time with no issue telling me just to take melatonin like that is an easy fix when it has never worked for me. If anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated. ",1,1756275352.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False
1n19dbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n19dbr/help_i_bought_a_strange_book_that_i_cant_stop/,"Help, I bought a strange book that I can't stop reading. I'm afraid of how it ends.","Since I was young I have loved books. From being read the stories within by my parents to learning to read and being able to discover the adventures within, my appreciation for the written word has always been part of my life.

When I was in high school I began collecting books. At first it was purely by accident, just a series of novels collected from my favorite authors. When I graduated and moved out I realized that I had amassed nearly 100 books, a mass that was difficult to find a place for when I moved into a studio apartment. Despite my lack of space, I still would find myself buying books from my local bookstore every month.

When I moved out of my tiny apartment into a 2-bedroom apartment, my best friend Lexi mentioned that it was a good thing I had picked a place with a room where I could store my collection of books, which had tripled in size in the four years since I moved out on my own. It was after I set the last box of books in what was soon to be my home office that she mentioned that I could probably make some money off of the books that I had acquired.

“With all of these books in here, I am sure there are a handful that are actually worth more than what you paid for,” Lexi said looking at an old first edition of The Great Gatsby that I had stacked on a precarious pile of J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis novels.

“I wouldn’t even know where to begin, plus I like having these tomes of history to surround me,” I replied as I glanced at the confusing IKEA instructions for the first of many bookshelves that I would be building throughout the evening.

“Just look online, I am sure you’ll be able to find a place that buys old books. You might even make enough money to add more to your collection,” She replied before grabbing us a couple beers for the long night ahead of us.

With that simple suggestion I entered into a rabbit hole of buying and reselling books, always certain to add to my collection more than what I sold off.

I began searching Estate Sales and Goodwill for old books that I could add to my collection and on the rare occasion sell off for more book spending money.

It was during one of my visits to an Estate Sale in a neighboring city that I found a peculiar book among a shelf of first editions and misprinted first runs. Bound in blue leather with an intricate gold trim was a book called *999 New Beginnings by C Foell*. Before I was able to open the book to begin to identify how old the book was, the Liquidator of the estate said that the collection of books could be mine for a bargain. Nine thousand dollars later, a price I was certain to make up for with the selling of a first edition of Blood Meridian, I gathered my new friends and returned home to my own personal fire hazard of a collection.

After I listed a few of my recent purchases online, I picked up the 999 New Beginnings and turned to the Copyright Page. However, I could not find the page in the first few pages of the tome. Instead, after a few blank pages, I saw the table of contents listing off the sections within. While it did not list 999 individual stories, it did list off nine different sections within the book. This did not make deciphering the contents any easier as it simply listed off what I could only assume were an antiquated understanding of elements.

Fire (written in red)
Ice (written in a light blue)
Wind (written in a light green)
Earth (written in a tannish brown)
Thunder (written in a vibrant yellow)
Water (written in a deep blue)
Shadow (written in a dark grey)
Holy (written in a silvery grey)
Void (written in a royal purple)

My curiosity was instantly peaked as each section did not have any corresponding page numbers, with no further clues, I began reading the first story.

The first story, with Fire and Earth above, told of a poor boy that lived within a desert kingdom. He struggled to find work and had to rely on his cunning to steal food to feed himself and his elderly mother. When he was caught by the royal guard, he avoided death by convincing the guards that he was actually the prince of the neighboring kingdom. When the Sultan heard of the guards’ disgraceful behavior, he begged the prince to marry his daughter to avoid the potential war that could arise for false imprisonment of the prince. The boy agreed and married the daughter, and had his elderly mother join them as his personal confidant.

The story was simple but while reading it, I felt the oddest sensation. I could feel the desert heat and smell the fresh baked bread as though I was reading the book in that fictional place rather than in my air conditioned apartment. I could feel my mouth drying out from the heat of a burning sun above and had to pause to get a glass of water before I could keep reading the book. When the boy celebrated his wedding and drank wine and ate fruit, I could almost taste the flavors of what the book was describing.

To me, the allure of books is their ability to make the reader feel like they are present in the story they are reading. It is why I had been so devoted in my love for books, but the book I had stumbled upon did by far the best in making me feel like I was actually there.

I turned to the next story, Water and Wind, depicting a story of a fisherman catching a fish that was told to be impossible to catch. The entire time I read I could smell the salty air and could almost feel the wind blowing mists of water onto my hair. When his boat capsized it was as if I too was struggling to catch my breath as the man untangled himself from his net and swam his way up for air. When he finally took in a lungful of air and began to cough up water, I too had the sensation of coughing water out of my lungs. When the man made his way back to shore and entered the lighthouse and collapsed by his fireplace, I too could feel the warmth of the fire spread across my own shivering form.

Despite the second story having a much more physical reaction out of me, I was unable to set the book down. I was drawn to the complete immersion I had while reading such simple yet captivating stories. I carried the book with me to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee before reading the next story with the words Ice, Wind, and Shadow written above.

The third story was set on the Bering Land Bridge and followed a nomadic tribe as they hunted a mammoth. The chill of the cold climate ached at my bones and I had to grab a blanket and turn off my air conditioning. A deep hunger began to ache in my stomach as the text described the weeks without any meat and the meager provisions quickly diminished. When the tribe was forced to consume the flesh of those who had dropped due to starvation I could feel the repulsive lurch in my stomach as though I too had partaken in the morbid consumption of human flesh. With the success of taking down the great beast near the end of the passage, I joyfully celebrated with the characters as they danced around a fire and praised their god for the successful hunt. However, when the tribe reached a strange new world, one of the characters fell and broke her leg and was left behind as the rest of the tribe ventured onward. With the close of the story, I began to feel a deep ache in my leg. While clearly my leg did not have a piece of bone jutting out, there was a ghostly pain as though I had once broken my leg years ago.

I sat the book down and walked towards the bathroom, the sudden heat of the summer day permeated and my decision to turn off my air conditioning seemed to have been a poor decision. I turned the unit back on, mildly amused that I had been so engrossed in the story that I had also joined in the freezing temperatures. It was as I staggered towards the bathroom that I realized my steps were not like my usual stride. I could still feel the phantom pain in my leg despite never having received an injury like that before.

I decided that sleep was all that I needed. I had obviously engrossed myself into the book and just needed some rest. A glance at the clock revealing that it was already well into the early morning confirmed my decision and I laid down for the night. Sleep welcomed me with dreams of desert kingdoms, fishing boats by lighthouses, and cold nights of desperation in search of food that wasn’t human.

Upon waking I checked my laptop to see that a couple of my listings were already purchased and hastily prepped the books to be shipped. With a quick run to the post office and a stop at a local bookstore to buy a couple Grisham and Patterson novels, I returned home to continue reading the strange book I had acquired.

The fourth story, Thunder and Holy marked at the top of the page, told of the youngest son of a noble family joining the clergy. When the middle brother was killed during the Thirty Years War, and the oldest brother was excommunicated for his blasphemous beliefs against the church, the youngest brother was sought after to take charge of the family holdings. As he prayed for guidance for what he should do, a bolt of lightning struck the Fir tree he would often sit under when he would think back about his childhood. As the tree burned down, I could smell the scent of burnt wood and light rain fill the air. The man decided that it was a sign to forsake his past and stay true to his faith. He refused the call and remained a clergyman, gaining much notoriety for his devotion. He died an old man, respected by the community for his devotion to faith, his family name forgotten along with any status that they once held.

I immediately jumped into the next story, labeled as Shadow and Void. The story followed a young man who was recruited by his twin sister and her friends as their designated driver and drink observer. There had been a string of girls that had gone out and had disappeared without a trace. The young man vigilantly watched out over his sister and her friends, placing his hand over drinks and tossing them out when unsavory characters lingered for too long near them. 

Strangely, the book had what looked like a couple of missing pages. Inspecting the book closer I noticed the slight fray of the remnants of the pages. An overwhelming disappointment filled me as key details of the story would be missing but I relented and continued reading. A strange sensation of dread filled me as I continued reading.

With a quick step, the young man caught up with his sister. He palmed the pill he was given by the overly friendly receptionist before tossing a breath mint into his mouth to dissuade her from any further inquiry. He entered the elevator with his sister before reassuring her that everything would be fine and that they would find her friends. As the elevator doors closed, they began to descend, his sister reaching for her head with slow and unsteady movements. 

He reached out for his sister, trying to catch her before she fell, when the sound of rushing air filled the small chamber and gas obfuscated his view. He began coughing, struggling to catch his breath, as I too could feel my lungs begin to fill with a foreign gas. He dropped to the ground as his vision blurred before falling into darkness.

I had entered into a trance-like state, unable to pull myself from the pages of the book. My hands, no longer my own, turned the page. Every nerve in my body screamed in protest as a flood of pain howled to my core.

The man was suspended, looking out at his sister as her body was cut open and vivisected. Pieces of her spread out into silver trays next to the medical table she laid upon. Glancing over towards a mirror erected at the foot of his own table, the man saw but could not comprehend the sight that mocked him.

He was nothing but a collection of his nervous system, connected to his eyes and brain. His physical form not even a shell of its former self. Instead it was a loose series of cords attached to a fatty chunk of grey. If he had a mouth it would be screaming in terror. One of the men in sterile white casually looked over at his form, expressionless due to the face mask and strange glasses. With a few steps the fiend in a doctor’s disguise approached a machine and made a few keystrokes before the young man returned to darkness.

When the world returned he was screaming. He began to ask of his sister and what happened to him but was met with only confusion. He didn’t have a sister, he was an only child and the people standing over him were his caretakers. When he sheepishly looked towards the mirror at the foot of his bed, the terror paralyzed him. Looking back at him was face he did not recognize, he was in a body that was not his own. He closed his eyes and began to pray that he would wake up from the hellish nightmare he had to be in.

I finally regained control of my body as the story concluded. My hands shook and I raced to the bathroom to look at myself. With a sigh of relief, the reflection I saw was my own. I returned to the book and closed it. After a few breaths I opened it to be greeted with the words Holy and Shadow at the top of the page.

A priestess stood before her followers and warned of invaders from the south coming to take their lands and spread their heresy. The tribes rebuked her as all who had challenged their might before had fallen. Despite her warnings of the threat being like any seen before, none heeded her call.

Three weeks later, men draped in tunics made of metal raided their villages with shields decorated with stars and crosses. They razed the buildings and desecrated the places of worship. As the priestess ran through the settlement, fire engulfing the place she had lived for sixteen winters, she was unable to outrun the powerful beasts dressed in the garb of their conquering commanders.

A net, reminiscent of the ones that her father had used when he would gather heaps of fish, was cast over her. Entangled in the ropes, she felt just as the creatures of the sea, struggling for freedom. As she was bound and dragged from her home she watched as the burning village grew smaller and smaller until only the feint glow of destruction was all that could be seen in the horizon.

Sat beside several other women and a few badly bruised men, the foreign invaders tossed small chunks of dense hardtack for the lot of them and a small mouthful of bitter wine. They yelled in a tongue that the priestess could not understand but a man amongst the soldiers that was one of her kinsmen but dressed more like the soldiers translated for them.

He told the captives to forsake their gods and accept the blasphemy of the invaders. That the key to survival was to accept the new way of life. While the others did as they were told and mimed the strange words as they were told, the priestess refused and spat the bitter wine and stale food out at the towering figure standing before her. Refusing to renounce her faith for the lies of invaders, the priestess was forced to her feet. The determined look in her eyes mirrored her resolve.

Her resolve was broken as her eyes were gouged out with a burning hot blade.

My eyes seared with pain and I dropped the book. I rushed to the bathroom, bumping into everything as I cried out in pain. The cold water I splashed onto my face soothed the fiery pain until I regained my sight a few minutes later. I dropped back and sat on the floor, resting my head against the wall as I contemplated the bizarre physical responses that I had experienced while reading this strange book. Despite every warning signal in my brain to leave the book alone, I returned to finish the story.

The former priestess did as her attackers commanded. She ate their food, drank their bitter wine, and mimicked their alien tongue. Her world was now dark, the sight she had been blessed with to see the warnings of the future were now cut off as she was no longer able to see anything ever again. Guided to an unknown and unlikely future, whenever she was commanded to do something, she did. The encouraging words of her kinsmen did little to mend her soul. She was held in high regard, but because of her warning being belittled, none of them would be able to practice what would become the old ways ever again.

The story ended with an unforeseen future for the former priestess, as my hand prickled with pins and needles throughout, I turned the page and read the top of the next page. It was titled with the royal purple of the word, Void. Hesitantly, I began to read the next story.

There was a young woman who was afraid she would disappear…

I closed the book immediately and tossed it across the room.

I did not want to know what the remainder of the story told.

I still fear what the story could unveil for me if I was to continue.

Yet, everyday I see the peculiar book I had acquired and can feel it call me to open the pages and dive more into the tales it contains.

Every story I have read, I have felt the experiences it has contained inside.

What would happen if I read more of a story about someone who feared disappearing and ended up disappearing in the story.

It is a fate I do not want to tempt.

The book still calls for a reader.

1n19d9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/yubacountyfive1978/comments/1n19d9v/hoping_for_some_clarification_on_the_found/,Hoping for some clarification on the found location of the Mercury.,"As the title asks, was hoping to get some clarification on where the Mercury was actually found and the state of the Oroville-Quincy highway at the time as a whole. 

First of all, regarding the location of the Mercury, according to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/yubacountyfive1978/comments/1kdgoos/i\_believe\_the\_missing\_enigmas\_most\_recent\_video/](https://www.reddit.com/r/yubacountyfive1978/comments/1kdgoos/i_believe_the_missing_enigmas_most_recent_video/), the coordinates in the post would put the location of the car around B in the upper right hand corner of the attached image. However, other posts and images indicate the location of the car was around the area called ""Rogers Cow Camp"" which is closer to A in the bottom left. Any ideas which one is closer?

  
My second question relates to the location of the car in relation to the main stem of the road. I've read conflicting things on whether the Mercury was found on the literal side of the main Oroville-Quincy road at the time, or an rough side forest road?

  
Tying into the final words of the previous question, my last questions regard the old condition/alignment of the road itself. According to previous discussion, the current alignment of the paved Oroville-Quincy visible in maps was only built in 1990? Are there any maps/photos that show a comparison of the current road and the alignment during the time of the disappearance? Are the old remains of the road currently still visible & traceable in the attached image as current forest roads, or have completely disappeared into the ether? Also, was the main Oroville-Quincy road at the time in this area paved at all or was it entirely rough? If it was all still dirt at this point, any ideas where the pavement ended at the time? 

  
I know in the grand scheme things details like these are rather superfluous compared to what the gentlemen endured, but any assistance/thoughts would be helpful. Thanks!

With that simple suggestion I entered into a rabbit hole of buying and reselling books, always certain to add to my collection more than what I sold off.

I began searching Estate Sales and Goodwill for old books that I could add to my collection and on the rare occasion sell off for more book spending money.

It was during one of my visits to an Estate Sale in a neighboring city that I found a peculiar book among a shelf of first editions and misprinted first runs. Bound in blue leather with an intricate gold trim was a book called *999 New Beginnings by C Foell*. Before I was able to open the book to begin to identify how old the book was, the Liquidator of the estate said that the collection of books could be mine for a bargain. Nine thousand dollars later, a price I was certain to make up for with the selling of a first edition of Blood Meridian, I gathered my new friends and returned home to my own personal fire hazard of a collection.

After I listed a few of my recent purchases online, I picked up the 999 New Beginnings and turned to the Copyright Page. However, I could not find the page in the first few pages of the tome. Instead, after a few blank pages, I saw the table of contents listing off the sections within. While it did not list 999 individual stories, it did list off nine different sections within the book. This did not make deciphering the contents any easier as it simply listed off what I could only assume were an antiquated understanding of elements.

Fire (written in red)
Ice (written in a light blue)
Wind (written in a light green)
Earth (written in a tannish brown)
Thunder (written in a vibrant yellow)
Water (written in a deep blue)
Shadow (written in a dark grey)
Holy (written in a silvery grey)
Void (written in a royal purple)

My curiosity was instantly peaked as each section did not have any corresponding page numbers, with no further clues, I began reading the first story.

The first story, with Fire and Earth above, told of a poor boy that lived within a desert kingdom. He struggled to find work and had to rely on his cunning to steal food to feed himself and his elderly mother. When he was caught by the royal guard, he avoided death by convincing the guards that he was actually the prince of the neighboring kingdom. When the Sultan heard of the guards’ disgraceful behavior, he begged the prince to marry his daughter to avoid the potential war that could arise for false imprisonment of the prince. The boy agreed and married the daughter, and had his elderly mother join them as his personal confidant.

The story was simple but while reading it, I felt the oddest sensation. I could feel the desert heat and smell the fresh baked bread as though I was reading the book in that fictional place rather than in my air conditioned apartment. I could feel my mouth drying out from the heat of a burning sun above and had to pause to get a glass of water before I could keep reading the book. When the boy celebrated his wedding and drank wine and ate fruit, I could almost taste the flavors of what the book was describing.

To me, the allure of books is their ability to make the reader feel like they are present in the story they are reading. It is why I had been so devoted in my love for books, but the book I had stumbled upon did by far the best in making me feel like I was actually there.

I turned to the next story, Water and Wind, depicting a story of a fisherman catching a fish that was told to be impossible to catch. The entire time I read I could smell the salty air and could almost feel the wind blowing mists of water onto my hair. When his boat capsized it was as if I too was struggling to catch my breath as the man untangled himself from his net and swam his way up for air. When he finally took in a lungful of air and began to cough up water, I too had the sensation of coughing water out of my lungs. When the man made his way back to shore and entered the lighthouse and collapsed by his fireplace, I too could feel the warmth of the fire spread across my own shivering form.

Despite the second story having a much more physical reaction out of me, I was unable to set the book down. I was drawn to the complete immersion I had while reading such simple yet captivating stories. I carried the book with me to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee before reading the next story with the words Ice, Wind, and Shadow written above.

The third story was set on the Bering Land Bridge and followed a nomadic tribe as they hunted a mammoth. The chill of the cold climate ached at my bones and I had to grab a blanket and turn off my air conditioning. A deep hunger began to ache in my stomach as the text described the weeks without any meat and the meager provisions quickly diminished. When the tribe was forced to consume the flesh of those who had dropped due to starvation I could feel the repulsive lurch in my stomach as though I too had partaken in the morbid consumption of human flesh. With the success of taking down the great beast near the end of the passage, I joyfully celebrated with the characters as they danced around a fire and praised their god for the successful hunt. However, when the tribe reached a strange new world, one of the characters fell and broke her leg and was left behind as the rest of the tribe ventured onward. With the close of the story, I began to feel a deep ache in my leg. While clearly my leg did not have a piece of bone jutting out, there was a ghostly pain as though I had once broken my leg years ago.

I sat the book down and walked towards the bathroom, the sudden heat of the summer day permeated and my decision to turn off my air conditioning seemed to have been a poor decision. I turned the unit back on, mildly amused that I had been so engrossed in the story that I had also joined in the freezing temperatures. It was as I staggered towards the bathroom that I realized my steps were not like my usual stride. I could still feel the phantom pain in my leg despite never having received an injury like that before.

I decided that sleep was all that I needed. I had obviously engrossed myself into the book and just needed some rest. A glance at the clock revealing that it was already well into the early morning confirmed my decision and I laid down for the night. Sleep welcomed me with dreams of desert kingdoms, fishing boats by lighthouses, and cold nights of desperation in search of food that wasn’t human.

Upon waking I checked my laptop to see that a couple of my listings were already purchased and hastily prepped the books to be shipped. With a quick run to the post office and a stop at a local bookstore to buy a couple Grisham and Patterson novels, I returned home to continue reading the strange book I had acquired.

The fourth story, Thunder and Holy marked at the top of the page, told of the youngest son of a noble family joining the clergy. When the middle brother was killed during the Thirty Years War, and the oldest brother was excommunicated for his blasphemous beliefs against the church, the youngest brother was sought after to take charge of the family holdings. As he prayed for guidance for what he should do, a bolt of lightning struck the Fir tree he would often sit under when he would think back about his childhood. As the tree burned down, I could smell the scent of burnt wood and light rain fill the air. The man decided that it was a sign to forsake his past and stay true to his faith. He refused the call and remained a clergyman, gaining much notoriety for his devotion. He died an old man, respected by the community for his devotion to faith, his family name forgotten along with any status that they once held.

I immediately jumped into the next story, labeled as Shadow and Void. The story followed a young man who was recruited by his twin sister and her friends as their designated driver and drink observer. There had been a string of girls that had gone out and had disappeared without a trace. The young man vigilantly watched out over his sister and her friends, placing his hand over drinks and tossing them out when unsavory characters lingered for too long near them. 

Strangely, the book had what looked like a couple of missing pages. Inspecting the book closer I noticed the slight fray of the remnants of the pages. An overwhelming disappointment filled me as key details of the story would be missing but I relented and continued reading. A strange sensation of dread filled me as I continued reading.

With a quick step, the young man caught up with his sister. He palmed the pill he was given by the overly friendly receptionist before tossing a breath mint into his mouth to dissuade her from any further inquiry. He entered the elevator with his sister before reassuring her that everything would be fine and that they would find her friends. As the elevator doors closed, they began to descend, his sister reaching for her head with slow and unsteady movements. 

He reached out for his sister, trying to catch her before she fell, when the sound of rushing air filled the small chamber and gas obfuscated his view. He began coughing, struggling to catch his breath, as I too could feel my lungs begin to fill with a foreign gas. He dropped to the ground as his vision blurred before falling into darkness.

I had entered into a trance-like state, unable to pull myself from the pages of the book. My hands, no longer my own, turned the page. Every nerve in my body screamed in protest as a flood of pain howled to my core.

The man was suspended, looking out at his sister as her body was cut open and vivisected. Pieces of her spread out into silver trays next to the medical table she laid upon. Glancing over towards a mirror erected at the foot of his own table, the man saw but could not comprehend the sight that mocked him.

He was nothing but a collection of his nervous system, connected to his eyes and brain. His physical form not even a shell of its former self. Instead it was a loose series of cords attached to a fatty chunk of grey. If he had a mouth it would be screaming in terror. One of the men in sterile white casually looked over at his form, expressionless due to the face mask and strange glasses. With a few steps the fiend in a doctor’s disguise approached a machine and made a few keystrokes before the young man returned to darkness.

When the world returned he was screaming. He began to ask of his sister and what happened to him but was met with only confusion. He didn’t have a sister, he was an only child and the people standing over him were his caretakers. When he sheepishly looked towards the mirror at the foot of his bed, the terror paralyzed him. Looking back at him was face he did not recognize, he was in a body that was not his own. He closed his eyes and began to pray that he would wake up from the hellish nightmare he had to be in.

I finally regained control of my body as the story concluded. My hands shook and I raced to the bathroom to look at myself. With a sigh of relief, the reflection I saw was my own. I returned to the book and closed it. After a few breaths I opened it to be greeted with the words Holy and Shadow at the top of the page.

A priestess stood before her followers and warned of invaders from the south coming to take their lands and spread their heresy. The tribes rebuked her as all who had challenged their might before had fallen. Despite her warnings of the threat being like any seen before, none heeded her call.

Three weeks later, men draped in tunics made of metal raided their villages with shields decorated with stars and crosses. They razed the buildings and desecrated the places of worship. As the priestess ran through the settlement, fire engulfing the place she had lived for sixteen winters, she was unable to outrun the powerful beasts dressed in the garb of their conquering commanders.

A net, reminiscent of the ones that her father had used when he would gather heaps of fish, was cast over her. Entangled in the ropes, she felt just as the creatures of the sea, struggling for freedom. As she was bound and dragged from her home she watched as the burning village grew smaller and smaller until only the feint glow of destruction was all that could be seen in the horizon.

Sat beside several other women and a few badly bruised men, the foreign invaders tossed small chunks of dense hardtack for the lot of them and a small mouthful of bitter wine. They yelled in a tongue that the priestess could not understand but a man amongst the soldiers that was one of her kinsmen but dressed more like the soldiers translated for them.

He told the captives to forsake their gods and accept the blasphemy of the invaders. That the key to survival was to accept the new way of life. While the others did as they were told and mimed the strange words as they were told, the priestess refused and spat the bitter wine and stale food out at the towering figure standing before her. Refusing to renounce her faith for the lies of invaders, the priestess was forced to her feet. The determined look in her eyes mirrored her resolve.

Her resolve was broken as her eyes were gouged out with a burning hot blade.

My eyes seared with pain and I dropped the book. I rushed to the bathroom, bumping into everything as I cried out in pain. The cold water I splashed onto my face soothed the fiery pain until I regained my sight a few minutes later. I dropped back and sat on the floor, resting my head against the wall as I contemplated the bizarre physical responses that I had experienced while reading this strange book. Despite every warning signal in my brain to leave the book alone, I returned to finish the story.

The former priestess did as her attackers commanded. She ate their food, drank their bitter wine, and mimicked their alien tongue. Her world was now dark, the sight she had been blessed with to see the warnings of the future were now cut off as she was no longer able to see anything ever again. Guided to an unknown and unlikely future, whenever she was commanded to do something, she did. The encouraging words of her kinsmen did little to mend her soul. She was held in high regard, but because of her warning being belittled, none of them would be able to practice what would become the old ways ever again.

The story ended with an unforeseen future for the former priestess, as my hand prickled with pins and needles throughout, I turned the page and read the top of the next page. It was titled with the royal purple of the word, Void. Hesitantly, I began to read the next story.

There was a young woman who was afraid she would disappear…

I closed the book immediately and tossed it across the room.

I did not want to know what the remainder of the story told.

I still fear what the story could unveil for me if I was to continue.

Yet, everyday I see the peculiar book I had acquired and can feel it call me to open the pages and dive more into the tales it contains.

Every story I have read, I have felt the experiences it has contained inside.

What would happen if I read more of a story about someone who feared disappearing and ended up disappearing in the story.

It is a fate I do not want to tempt.

The book still calls for a reader.

I'm afraid of how it ends.","Since I was young I have loved books. From being read the stories within by my parents to learning to read and being able to discover the adventures within, my appreciation for the written word has always been part of my life.

When I was in high school I began collecting books. At first it was purely by accident, just a series of novels collected from my favorite authors. When I graduated and moved out I realized that I had amassed nearly 100 books, a mass that was difficult to find a place for when I moved into a studio apartment. Despite my lack of space, I still would find myself buying books from my local bookstore every month.

When I moved out of my tiny apartment into a 2-bedroom apartment, my best friend Lexi mentioned that it was a good thing I had picked a place with a room where I could store my collection of books, which had tripled in size in the four years since I moved out on my own. It was after I set the last box of books in what was soon to be my home office that she mentioned that I could probably make some money off of the books that I had acquired.

“With all of these books in here, I am sure there are a handful that are actually worth more than what you paid for,” Lexi said looking at an old first edition of The Great Gatsby that I had stacked on a precarious pile of J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis novels.

“I wouldn’t even know where to begin, plus I like having these tomes of history to surround me,” I replied as I glanced at the confusing IKEA instructions for the first of many bookshelves that I would be building throughout the evening.

“Just look online, I am sure you’ll be able to find a place that buys old books. You might even make enough money to add more to your collection,” She replied before grabbing us a couple beers for the long night ahead of us.

I live in Istanbul and I’m currently learning French. In the future I’m planning to move to Paris, so I’d love to practice more and connect with French speakers.

If you are a French person visiting Istanbul, living here, or if you’re also looking for a language exchange (French to Turkish), feel free to reach out.

I’d be happy to share local tips about Istanbul, have coffee, or just practice languages together.

1n1994z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1n1994z/a_trick_of_the_light_louise_penny/,A Trick of the Light - Louise Penny,"Hey everyone!

I just finished diving into a truly captivating book, and I couldn't wait to share my thoughts with you all. If you're looking for a mystery that's more than just a whodunit, you might want to check out [A Trick of the Light - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/a-trick-of_the_light-louise-penny/). It's part of the Chief Inspector Gamache series, and it really showcases what makes these books so special.

***

### What's It All About? (No Spoilers, Promise!)

This particular book takes us back to the charming, but sometimes surprisingly dark, village of Three Pines. The story centers around the murder of a widely admired, yet deeply complicated, artist named Clara Morrow. She's a local, and her art exhibition was a huge success, but not long after, she's found dead in her garden. Chief Inspector Gamache and his team are called in to investigate, and what they uncover is a tangle of emotions, old friendships, jealousies, and the many hidden ""tricks of the light"" that people use to present themselves to the world. It’s less about a thrilling chase and more about peeling back layers of human nature and perception.

***

### What I Really Liked

One of the best things about Louise Penny's books, and this one is no exception, is the **characters**. Inspector Gamache himself is just fantastic – wise, compassionate, and incredibly insightful. You genuinely feel like you're learning alongside him. But it's not just him; the recurring residents of Three Pines feel like old friends (or sometimes, delightfully annoying neighbours). They're so well-developed, with all their quirks and flaws. I especially love how their relationships evolve over the series.

The **writing style** is also a huge draw for me. Penny has a way with words that makes even mundane descriptions feel poetic. She creates such a strong atmosphere – you can practically smell the autumn leaves and the coffee from the bistro. It’s cozy, but with a serious undercurrent of psychological depth that keeps you totally hooked. It’s not a fast-paced thriller where something explodes on every page; the **pacing** is more deliberate, allowing you to really immerse yourself in the emotional landscape of the story. This allows the emotions to really sink in. I found myself feeling empathy, frustration, and sadness right along with the characters.

***

### A Little Balance (What Might Not Be For Everyone)

While I absolutely adore the thoughtful pacing, I can see how it might not be for everyone. If you're someone who prefers a lightning-fast plot with constant action, this might feel a little slow to start. It takes its time building the world and exploring the characters before the full intensity of the mystery unfolds. Also, Penny often delves into philosophical reflections on life, art, and human nature. I love this, but if you prefer just a straightforward puzzle, some of these reflective moments might feel a bit tangential.

***

### Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!

If this sounds like your kind of read, you can often find [A Trick of the Light - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/a-trick-of_the_light-louise-penny/) at your local library or bookstore, or online. I would wholeheartedly recommend *A Trick of the Light*, especially for anyone who enjoys **character-driven mysteries, psychological fiction, or just a really well-written story with a strong sense of place.** If you loved authors like Agatha Christie for their clever plotting but wish for more depth of character, then Louise Penny is for you.

***

### A Little Tip for New Readers

For those of you who might be new to reading or just getting into longer series, don't feel intimidated!

1.  **Start Anywhere, But Consider the Beginning:** While you *can* jump into this book (Penny usually gives you enough context), reading the Gamache series from the very beginning (starting with *Still Life*) is a truly rewarding experience. You get to see the characters grow and change over time, which adds so much to the later books.
2.  **Take Your Time:** These aren't books to rush through. Savor the descriptions, pay attention to the subtle clues, and let the atmosphere wash over you.
3.  **Don't Stress About Guessing:** With mysteries, sometimes we feel pressure to figure out ""whodunit."" Don't let that spoil your enjoyment. Focus on the journey, the characters, and the beautiful writing. The solution will come!
4.  **Read a Little Each Day:** If a book feels big, commit to just one chapter a day, or even just 15-20 minutes. You'll be amazed at how quickly you make progress without feeling overwhelmed.

So, if you're curious and looking for a captivating mystery that's more than just a whodunit, why not give [A Trick of the Light - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/a-trick-of_the_light-louise-penny/) a try? I'd love to hear your thoughts if you've read it, or if you decide to pick it up!

# Roasting Levels

Light roast coffee has a bright taste. It keeps its natural flavor. The beans are not roasted long. So, they are light brown. This roast has more acidity. It also has fruity notes. Some people find it the least bitter. If you like gentle flavors, try this. It is a great choice.

Medium roast coffee is balanced. Not too strong or mild. The beans are brown, not dark. It is less acidic than light roast. This roast has a rich flavor. Some say it tastes like nuts or chocolate. It is smooth and sweet. Many people enjoy this roast. It’s a good middle ground.

Dark roast coffee has a bold taste. The beans are roasted longer. They are dark brown or black. This roast has low acidity. It often tastes smoky or bitter. Some people like its strong flavor. If you want a deep taste, choose dark roast. It has a heavy body.

1n193hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n193hq/this_unrestful_house_the_temple_in_my_basement/,This Unrestful House (The Temple in my Basement),"Ever since I was born, I knew there were bones in this house, so I was the only one that knew they had been moving. On sleepless nights I heard rattling in the wall behind my headboard, and when I was the only one awake at dawn I followed the sound of scraping to catch a femur in between me and the main door. It all laid dormant until I found a temple deep in the basement a month ago.

 

 

In my childhood, I had dreams of crawling around these hardwood floorboards, getting grime stuck to my knees the legs I had were always that of an adult. Through dim moonlit corridors, I slugged along an invisible trail that was only tangible to me the way cartoons fly towards the scent of a fresh pie. It always started off mid-action, flailing limbs galloping without thought, already out of breath, cheeks hurting from an open-mouth smile. Remember being a hider 10 seconds before the seeker opens their eyes?

As I crawled deeper into the house −descending the stairs, windows getting farther, rooms only getting darker− my knees beat to a leaky faucet tempo, collecting, dropping slower than the previous. No sound, musty air, my back was wet and my arms were sticky. Dirt matted beneath my palms, but I could not stop moving…moving towards the basement door. I groped the void in front of me, too deep in the house to see, but I felt its outlines. No hinges, I had to push.

On my aching knees, blind and childlike, I scanned the wall with my filth matted fingers to find the doorknob. A fingernail on my left hand clicked against it and I felt my lungs tighten to the break of the silence. I clasped both hands around it and positioned myself to open. Left hand on the doorknob and my right on the door. My wrist would twist, then I’d wake up.

 

 

“Ma, did you find it?” I shouted. “Don’t be impatient with me!” Her shout was muffled from her being down the basement and my being in the living room. I sat on the couch embarrassed at myself; In front of me was a checklist for things I needed before a big move, but I needed my mommy to go to the basement for me. I pushed my face in my palms, giving out a muffled, “What the hell is my problem?” But, in my head that thinking devolved into…What the hell is my problem? What the hell was their problem? I can’t believe they coddled that fear. God, they should’ve just thrown me down there and let me deal with it. At my big age and I still can’t-

“Found it.” Behind me, she tossed a flashlight on my lap, then dropped a cart on the table in front of me with a thunk. “There’s some old stuff of yours I thought you’d want to look through.”  “Thank you,” I muttered, “Sorry.” She just waved her arm and wiped a drop of sweat on her forehead, making a beeline to her room. Less things on the list to buy. That’s good. That’s great. Yippee. Of course, that little achievement didn’t last long, it took no time for me to feel bad that I made my mother sweat on a summer day.

I held the flashlight and imagined being in a power outage. In a couple of months, I would be living a new big-city life, an apartment already waited for me a plane ride away, but when I started to think about standing in those new white walls my mind always drifted to the basement. There always came sandbag heavy guilt knowing that I’ll leave the house I loved with one room unopened. All because of my little child’s fear I couldn’t get over. I felt homesick for the house I hadn’t even left yet, and whose fault was that? I guess someone could find humour in it though; I was scared of the basement, but not of the bones I knew were in my house. There was nothing to be scared of, though, they weren’t dangerous, they were just there. Well, what would I even say? “There are bones in the walls…It’s just a feeling I’ve had since I was a kid…Well, I wouldn’t say it’s haunted because they don’t hurt me…No, I can’t show you proof because I don’t have proof, but just trust me, I swear, I swear, I swear.” It wasn’t worth the time to explain. I put the flashlight in my pocket.

 

 

My earliest memory of the bones was on a late evening. I watched TV while my mother slept on the couch, playing with a bow on my shirt, sitting on the floor because although I was old enough to jump, I wasn’t old enough to reach the sofa myself. The volume was low and I only paid attention because it was the sole light source of the living room. But its noise faded to low fuzz and the toons turned to glossy colours, so my gaze flickered to the walls. Dark and smooth behind the TV, there was no reason why I was eyeing it; my favourite program was on the screen and the pink dog got in trouble again, so really, I should be paying attention because that was a new episode. It’s just that the haziness of the glow made the wallpaper look like it was moving. A visual representation of radio crackle and camouflaged snake scales. I got up and made my way over with an outstretched hand. Child logic went like this: You’re going to be the lucky duck that discovers some otherworld animal and you will discover that you are a fantastical prodigy and you’ll be taken on an adventure that nobody will believe, but you will know is true, and it will be just like the movies.

Imagine my disappointment when the wall was flat, smooth, unmoving. I continued feeling out the wall though, since I was already there. My hand going lower and lower behind the TV, my eyelids dropping lower and lower too. Eyes closed and on the verge of falling asleep, I felt a clear group of bumps on the wall. Thinking it was just the bunch of TV wires, I kept running my hand over the hard clump. It was the size of my palm, or…bigger? Longer braille-like protrusions stuck out in lines from the edges of the big mass at the center. So much so that all my fingers could feel out an individual stump. It didn’t feel connected to anything, it wasn’t the bunch of wires, this was in the wall itself. My whole hand covered all the edges of this mass completely as if I was just pressing onto the shape of another hand. The shape of another hand. I was pressing onto another hand.

I jolted out and hit the TV with a hollow thump that almost woke my mom. Eyes open now, I looked at that space. Flat. I reached out and felt around the wall. Flat. Whatever was in the walls, it was gone.

 

 

Everyone was sleeping, recovering from the type of hot, humid day that threatens your eyes with sleep. Golden hour approached and the house glowed, but, of course, light always became dimmer the closer I got to the basement door. In front of it, I waited. It was one of those perfect, slow days that feels like a checkpoint outside time and change. When I reached for the brass doorknob I missed, so I moved my left hand up to reach again and, almost prophetically, my fingernail clicked against the doorknob. The sound alone made me recoil, I took a couple of seconds to make a move again. I placed a firm hand and waited for myself to twist. I couldn’t help but feel as if I was holding the hand of something alive, so I just stood there for a while, until I mustered up the balls to do a countdown.

5…

4…

3…

2…

The door was so easily opened, there was no weight to the push, no resistance to the limp doorknob, the hinges didn’t even creak. Such an underwhelming open, and in an instant, the basement became welcoming. Behind me, the air shifted, wind lightly rattled windows I couldn’t see, but what I could see was the yellow glow of the afternoon shifting to grey. Evening was calling, I had to commit. Before I went down the stairs, I left the door open to let light in because the switch was all the way at the bottom. My feet planted steady along the gradually dimming descent and as soon as I hit that bottom step, my arm mid-air ready for the light switch, the door shut.

***

It was actually very mundane. A rotting baby crib, crates caked with dust, shelves for storage, mold on the ceiling. Wasn’t very big too, and with its musty nature I felt like being in a public library toilet. I made one round looking, didn’t touch anything. Nothing caught my eye, so I was already up and at it at the top of the stairs when that guilt punched my gut again. What a waste to finally be there and leave with nothing, I had to find a trinket or something to leave with, a token of luck and passing fears.

I scanned the room again, without hyper eyes, and did find something of interest; not a trinket though, but behind the crib I saw an outline of a small door. I must’ve not seen it, masked within the lines and shadows of the crib, but I knew what I saw the closer I got. Under my attempt to move it away, the wood was soft and crumbly. I left marks over the mold growing at its planks and wondered why my parents never just gave it away if it remained unused and bound to rot.

The little door at my knees was shoddy craft wood and locked in place, but I figured if the crib was untouched and old enough to rot, the door must be older. So, I grabbed old football shoes I saw beside old ABC and multiplication books, stuffed my overgrown feet in them, got on the floor and gave a light kick. It wasn’t loud at all, and I already felt the soft wood loosen its fibers. My next kick created an opening and, looking down, my foot was in the middle of a black hole. I didn’t want to stop then, this was the interesting thing in this uninteresting basement, the something I wanted to leave the basement with. As a token of luck and passing fears, I put the flashlight from my pocket in my mouth, and on my hands and knees I scuttled through a tunnel.

 

 

I sang a little song in my mind because it took longer than expected, and the sloppy beat of my limbs thumped like a metronome. Drool dripped off the torch, I worried it would slip out and roll deeper into the darkness without me. I gripped its ridges tighter between my teeth.

The edges of the tunnel ended, and my dirty hand reached out the hole only to be knocked back from the outside. I crawled out and stood straight in a gap between the hole and this wall, the light from my mouth showed an edge to my right, I followed.

Then an edge to my left, I followed.

Then I stepped out of this crawl space to an empty dirt room with big holes at the bottom of the wall ahead. Empty, until I looked back.  

This room was as big as a tennis court, bent wood columns – fire hydrant thick – stood tall in each corner, holding a sagging ceiling up.  Looking back at my crawl space,  I realized each wall in the room was lined with three tunnels, pits of black indenting the walls. Handprints caked over the area of wall in front of the holes, I realized then that I wore no socks to protect my ankles. I only looked at the room first because I didn’t want to acknowledge what was at the center, but the light showed me anyway. Slabs of stone formed the shape of a cube and painted over the entrance were two circular oriental sigils I mistook for eyes. Worn like a bad wig, the top was covered by some bulbous structure that drooped to one side like a military beret. Dried grey slop showed finger made patterns of waves and holes lining the edges of details. Pelts of fur covered the entrance from the inside. I looked up at the whole form and felt my knees buckle at its sigil eyes, wide and red. It seemed like a wet and matted Chinese lion looked down at me with animals for teeth and I was at its mouth.

The moment I poked my head through the fur, I inhaled an acrid humidity of fermentation. Incense, coins, moldy fruit hoarded around a moss covered well at the center. Thick and caking the edges, covering the hole, and spread out, infesting the dirt floor. On the walls and on the ceiling, my torch gave light to orange Indo-Chinese patterns lining the walls, striped and stacked layer upon layer. I backed away from the center, scared that the thick moss, wet and shining, would easily bring me to my knees in these worn-down cleats.

I’d seen enough. I’d scared myself realizing I was intruding some sacred silence and wondering whether my rummaging had echoed through those other tunnels for whatever was at the end to hear. Moving back towards my exit felt foreign as I made a conscious effort to slow down and reduce sound, but that made the silence all the more excruciating and my inching through the gap became a waiting game. Once I found my tunnel I started at a steady pace, then gradually, a rising claustrophobia kicked in and I felt as if the darkness behind me was a tangible presence. Scuttle turned to crawl turned to scamper while mud burrowed underneath my fingernails as I clawed my way out. I climbed faster and fumbled noisier and my back hit the dirt top and my hair clumped at my face and I got out heaving, staring at this menacing mouth of black. I could feel its warm humidity upon my face like a long sour exhale. I dragged the crib over the hole, then shaking on the ground, I unlaced the tattered shoes.

My feet needed to re-adjust to standing straight, I went up like I walked a plank. I was too too aware of every sound that I scared myself with my own footsteps at the top of the stairs. Just as I opened the door, the light behind me flickered and I saw that the sun was gone.

 

 

“I went in the basement last night”

Both their eyes went wide over morning coffee and the tinkling of knife on toast stopped as my dad went still.

Last night was the first time I heard rattling in the wall behind my headboard. No sleep, all I could think about was the open air that bridged that temple and my room.

He smirked and leaned over the dining table, said through open teeth, “You’re lying.”

“What the hell is behind that crib.”

His face fell and my mom shifted in her seat, flicking her eyes between him and I.

“So you did go down there…Congrats! You know what? This is great, let me take you that new Vietnamese spot for dinner, my treat!”

“…What?” I was in pure disbelief.

It’s like I told him I aced my finals; he just stared at me like I was overreacting; He was underreacting. My question seemed to go from one ear and out the other to him.

“What?” He stared at me. “You don’t like Vietnamese food?”

“I asked you what was behind the crib.”

“Well, I’m guessing you saw that pallet on the wall. It’s been there forever. Your grandpa always told me not to touch it.”

Both of them were unfazed, happy, actually, for me.

“So, you don’t know what’s behind it?”

“It’s been there since I was born.”

“Why are you so caught up about that,” my mom asked, “You just went into the basement, I feel like that’s the bigger deal for everyone at this table, especially you.”

“There is a whole…thing down there.”

“What, in the basement? Goddammit!” She frowned at my dad, “You know I told you two weeks ago I thought there were rodents down there!” “How is this my fault? Anyway, it’s not about that. Today, I think we sho-“

“I mean behind that pallet.”

My confession brought a pause to the room. My dad spoke up. “You broke the pallet?”

I only realized then that, regardless of me finding what’s down there, I defaced what wasn’t mine. I nodded with hesitation, waiting for shouting to ensue. God, I thought, why did I think they wouldn’t get ma-

“So, what’s behind it?” He said. My parents looked at each other, waiting for me to answer with curiosity that must’ve brewed for years. “Well, go on.”

My toes curled under the table as I recounted the ordeal. I refused to think about it last night, so my account sounded like hasty ramblings with me stuttering to find the right words. I watched as their eyebrows went up and down, their expressions fluctuating through different moments of the story.

In the end, my dad stared at the table. All he mustered out was, “Huh.”

He sat still, lost in this thoughts. With crossed arms and gazing at my father’s shoes, my mom groaned out, “When we got married, I said I didn’t want to move in here, remember?”

My dad rubbed his face in his hands, then let out a heavy sigh. “Well, it grew on you, didn’t it?”

They just sat there, in their heads. While I just sat there, waiting.

“So…” I mumbled.

“So?” My dad questioned.

“What now?”

“Well…Ah, what can I do, it’s already there.” He gave one of those white-collar smirks that aren’t really smirks; The type all coworkers have locked and loaded.

“So, you’ll just leave it?”

“I mean, I’ll board it up again sooner or later. Hey,” he chuckled, “maybe stay out of the basement again, yeah?” He slapped his legs to get up from his chair, grabbing each dish on the table. “You and your mom get ready. Let’s spend the day outside.”

We sat while he cleared the table. When my mom got up, so did I, and I followed behind her.

“What’s wrong with him?” I whispered behind her.

“Look, your dad really fought to be the kid that gets this house,” she made sure to keep her tone hushed, “if your uncles find out there’s an issue here…” She threw up her arms. “You know how fast news spread on his side.”

“What about you? Don’t you want to do something?”

We were right in front of my parents’ door when she stopped and turned to me, “What I want is to keep the peace,” her voice still low, she tried to sound sympathetic, but I heard tension in her words. “Your dad’s right, this house grew on me. I don’t want you to go down there again. He will figure out what he needs to do.”

She went into the room and shut the door before I had a chance to say anything else. Each noise from the kitchen made the walk to my room feel manual, like if I listened too closely I might forget where my room was. My limbs were stiff and sore as I wriggled in and out of armholes, putting on pants was excruciating to the bruises on my knees.

I took a moment to myself before heading to the car, preparing my face to spend a day of plastered expression and avoiding the elephant in my mind. Last night, I swore I saw a skeleton hunched over and facing me at the corner of my room, but I guess tricks of the eye mistake slight changes of light for the ridges of a ribcage. I headed out with my hand on the doorknob and before the gap between my door and the wall closed, I saw a skull on my windowsill.

***

My house became a hellhole. Every second of those next few weeks felt like thick cough syrup dripping down my throat. I started noticing mold on the walls and fungus behind furniture. The couch felt sticky. There came a damp stagnancy in the air whenever I entered a new room, I felt like walking through barren shells of corpses.

It was excruciating being in the same room as them. How could I look them in the eye after what they had done? They had done nothing. I’d hear their conversations through 2 rooms and a corridor, somehow, they had gotten louder day by day, and each muffled hum, hiss, crack of their voice would tighten my chest and make me want to tear my face off. I’d spent mornings in my room waiting for them to leave; their eyes on me were a tension felt from the pads of my toes to the back of my eyes.

And then what? When alone, I’d catch a ribcage stuck and spinning with the ceiling fan. I felt tapping beneath the floorboards at my feet. Once, I ran my hand over my computer mouse without looking and felt my fingers sliding between eye sockets of a skull. But worse, oh God, worse were the sounds, its rain stick rattle traveled up each curvature of my spine, snaking up each vertebrae. So, when I realized that not a moment went by that I wasn’t on edge, I realized this house was no longer hospitable. I felt more homesick than I ever did; this was no longer the house I grew up in, and whose fault was that? To be honest, I couldn’t say whether my problems were real, or a product of that temple being stuck on my mind. Maybe I should’ve ignored it like they did, because even though I spent my last weeks there to savour last moments, I instead made my house a ghoulish stand-in for what it once was.

Understand that I was being pushed to the edge. I would sleep with skeletons at the foot of my bed then wake up from a tickle on my feet. Nights were a cycle of sleeping and waking up and crying and sleeping and waking up. Every sensation and thought was being occupied in this house by this house. This damn house. This damn unrestful house! So, I can only beg to be pitied when I say: 4 nights before I left, I stayed up alone with an empty bag and waited to catch all those bones, so I could drop them deep and down where I thought they would stay. That tunnel. That temple. That well.

 

 

The hum of the blue kitchen light was the only noise and the only light source. I sat still on the sofa, staring at the blank TV. Waiting.  

There was scraping at the stairs. Focused, fluid, I snaked my way along dark corners to find a spine spasming at the top step. I didn’t blink once as I receded my body against a dark wall, slithering my limbs down into an ape-like crouch. I must’ve looked like a neanderthal when I pounced, skipping steps, breathing through my mouth, to snatch and shove it in my bag. My arms muffled its scratching on the canvas fabric, but I just couldn’t take any noise from it anymore. I swear this house had implanted some primal, Darwinian parasite because I promise I wasn’t thinking when I grabbed each end and twisted it like a wet towel. It sounded like biting into chicken cartilage on a hungry day.

Not long after, I found a skull rolling down a hall, a foot scuttling inside an empty vase and more and more. I even tripped, got the wind knocked out of me. Ears ringing and my eyes dizzying up, on my back, I waved my arms to find the bag…then I grazed those braille bumps, the same size as my hand like it was before. But I didn’t pull away, no, I grabbed it between its spidery fingers and crushed it through my grip. It tore up the back of my hand bloody, but it stopped. After all those years, I finally had my hand and more and more. Then, at last, there it was again…that damn femur in front of the damn door. It was the last to go and I knew it was already dawn. From the end of a long hallway, I leapt with arms outstretched…but it didn’t move. Thrown off-guard, I almost hit a wall when I attempted to slow down. It was right in front of me, unmoving. So I stood up straight, and placed it in my bag with ease.

With aching shoulders I lugged the backpack on, and in front of the basement door I felt again that stagnant middle-place like from the first visit. I couldn’t remember the house feeling that still in a long time. I stood there, taking it in before my descent.

The darkness down the stairs only amplified the thuds of my heart. I imagined some tar-black devil staring inches away from my nose, but when I turned on the light I was only face-to-face with that rotting crib. Behind it, open and inviting, was the tunnel. He never closed it up.

A light scuttle in my bag made me jump, reminding me that it was my carelessness which started this infestation that no one wanted to clean up. The tunnel was too narrow for the bag to be on my back, so I tugged it along my ankle, scraping as I crawled with the torch in my mouth.

It was a harder commute. Over time the dirt became mud and clung to my clothes, breathing felt like cling wrap against my torso. Movements turned sloppy, by the end, I practically slipped out the tunnel. Caked in slop, the bag was heavier, I heaved and moaned from the weight, dragging it across the gap, breathing in sour dankness. I stood at the mouth of the lion temple.

I just wanted it over with. It scraped up across the moss floor, knocking over burned-out candles, breaking open moldy fruit, the air filled with a rank tang. The bag became so heavy with excess mud that I had to squat to bring it up, and still I slipped with the moss, smashing my face against the edge of the well.

Through trials of labour I got it up. Before the final push, I saw my arm. Looked down, saw my legs. My body. The slop-caked troll I had become. In a rage, I pushed it, too hard.

It disappeared deeper and deeper into the empty well, until I heard a drumline of thuds from the gorge, then I heard it around me. The room shook and light to the wall revealed how wet the room had become.

Mud slugged down the columns, the walls dripped and the ground gave a tremor. Wet piles dropped down from the ceiling and I jerked myself to get out, but the slick moss brought me to my knees. I must’ve looked like a bug under disinfectant, struggling to find footing.

As the temple creaked with shifting stones, I knew the ceiling was going to give out in no time. I kicked the well to slide out, but I only made it so far that my head poked out of the pelts. In front of me, those holes at the bottom of the wall had deformed, caved in on itself like a crushed artery. Those columns, decayed with age, had bent and snapped. The entire room was a cesspool of collapsing sludge, and I was being swallowed.

My elbows pushed and pushed through the slimy floor. I wailed, cried like a banshee as I felt my limbs start to sink down the softening ground. Snot bubbled on my nose when my torso made it out, but as I gave one more push, the temple collapsed on me.

There was no way out. I buried my head in my arms. I waited for the mud to compress me.

A fat plop landed on my back, constricting my chest to breathe. One more dropped on my head, striking it down into the sludge below.

Every next drop didn’t bring anymore force, just harder, heavier compression.

Within the mud seeping into my ears, I hear the muffled groans of this stomach folding in on itself.

I miss home, but I know now I should’ve left when I had the chance. I know now that I will never be able to go back to the house that was hospitable because it never was in the first place. I realize that the walls had been molding from the beginning.",1,1756274271.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1n1938o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyLynnBradley/comments/1n1938o/the_three_witnesses_at_the_disco_narrowing_down/,The Three Witnesses at the Disco: Narrowing down the timeline,"There has been a lot of debate surrounding the testimonies of the three witnesses who claimed to have seen Amy with Alister Douglas in the early hours of March 24, 1998. The main point of contention is whether the times they recalled seeing Amy and Yellow together were accurate. While I acknowledge it can be difficult to fully verify witness statements, especially regarding exact times, I believe there is enough information available to form a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence provided. Below I will provide a brief synopsis of the witnesses' statements and offer my analysis. 
\ 
**The Witnesses’ Accounts:**

Lori Renick and Crystal Roberts reported that they returned to their cabin in the early morning hours after the nightclub closed. They decided they weren’t sleepy, so they decided to go hang out on the deck. Lori stated this was sometime between 5:00 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. This was when they saw Amy and Alister Douglas enter the glass elevator together and go up to the 11th deck. (The Viking Lounge, aka “disco”) About 10-15 minutes later, both Lori and Crystal see Alister Douglas return and walk right past them. He was alone. A few minutes after that, both Lori and Crystal returned to their cabin. The girls had forgotten to take the keycard with them, so they had to knock on the door. Crystal’s mother, Ann, opened the door for them and asked what they were doing out so late, as it was almost 6:00 a.m. The girls report as presented by Netflix can be viewed \[at this link\](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Femzi4ni6z1lf1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1620%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D3e13dfd862a418c0bf7f8203a7538b3f2d0f846e)

The third witness, Elizabeth, who was in the Viking Lounge early that morning, corroborated Lori and Crystal’s account. Elizabeth stated that she saw Amy and Alister Douglas get off the glass elevator and enter the Viking Lounge. She observed them walk over to the bar; Douglas turned up the music and gave Amy a dark-coloured drink which could have been Coke or coffee. Elizabeth left the lounge shortly afterwards, as she had a shore excursion booked for Curacao. She then waited to disembark the ship.

**My Analysis:**

Some have argued that the three witnesses may have been mistaken about the times they saw Amy and Douglas together, suggesting they were actually recalling when they saw them in the disco at around 3:30 a.m. However, considering the information provided by Crystal’s mother, who stated she let the girls back into the cabin at around 6:00 a.m., and, most importantly, the testimony provided by Elizabeth, it stands to reason that these events most likely occurred between 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., not earlier.

Elizabeth stated that she left the Viking Lounge shortly after seeing Amy and Alister Douglas together and waited to disembark the ship. She obviously would not have been preparing to disembark at 3:30 in the morning.

**What happened afterwards?**

If these witness accounts occurred between 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., this dramatically narrows down the possibilities of what could have happened. If these times are accurate, it would confirm that Amy’s last known location before her disappearance was the Viking Lounge/upper deck area.

It has been reported that there was a service/freight elevator located on the 11th deck, connecting the upper deck to the cargo hold.

*By Your Friendly Neighborhood Baseball Oracle (with a side of dad jokes)*

The Chicago Cubs (-150) and San Francisco Giants (+130) clash in a matchup that’s as lopsided as a soufflé in a hurricane. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a ballpark vendor shouting over a crowd.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Cubs Are the Favorite

The Cubs enter this game as a **-150 road favorite**, implying a **60% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s like betting on a vending machine to drop a free Snickers—unlikely, but not impossible if you’ve had a bad day. The Giants, at **+130**, suggest bookmakers think they have a **43% chance**, which is about the same odds of your Uncle Bob remembering to wear pants to a family reunion.

Key stats tilt the scale:

* **Colin Rea (Cubs)** vs. **Carson Whisenhunt (Giants)**: Rea’s 3.96 ERA and 93 strikeouts in 127 innings are solid, but Whisenhunt’s **4.91 ERA**, **1.44 strike-to-walk ratio**, and **1.418 WHIP** make him the baseball equivalent of a leaky faucet—annoying and prone to flooding the lineup.
* **Team ERAs**: The Cubs’ 3.76 ERA (third-lowest in MLB) vs. the Giants’ 3.74 ERA? It’s a statistical tie, but the Cubs’ **1.195 WHIP** (fewest walks/hits per inning) is like a fortress compared to the Giants’ **1.288 WHIP** (16th in MLB). San Francisco’s pitchers are basically a sieve with a coupon for “Buy One, Walk One Free.”
* **Offense**: The Cubs slug **1.4 home runs per game** (.428 slugging %) with power hitters like **Pete Crow-Armstrong** (.508 SLG) and **Kyle Tucker** (.464 SLG). The Giants? They hit 128 HRs total, which is roughly the number of times a fan yells “STEEEE-RIKE!” during a close call.

1n190xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1n190xn/im_sorry_i_love_you_please_forgive_me/,"I’m Sorry, I Love You, Please Forgive Me","I write here for a few reasons, sometimes just processing, other times figuring out words to feelings, a lot of stream of consciousness brain dumps of what’s running through my mind before bed so I can sleep. It’s honestly really hard on me to have lost you in any and all capacity from my life. I wish I could just talk to you about a lot of these things instead of internet strangers. I don’t really ever expect you to care enough to come looking for these letters when you won’t talk to me IRL so I don’t really write them for you as much as myself, to help lighten what weighs on me before it become too much to carry alone again.

But this one, this one is for you, to you. If you read anything, I want you to know this.

You can’t possibly understand how important the words “I love you” mean to me and hard it was for me to say them or how much it hurt to never hear or read them from you. And even amongst that pain among some of other honestly shitty things you’ve done or said I never stopped genuinely loving you. You piss me the fuck off sometimes and you crush me to my core but that love I feel inside never ever flickers in the chaos. So I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it because it will suffocate me long before I am able to suffocate it.

And what choice have you left me? You never gave me or us a fair shot. I’ll never understand for the life of me what is so wrong with me you don’t want anything to do with me at all or don’t even love me as a friend after the years I spent being there for you whenever you gave me the time of day again after tossing me aside like trash each time you left. I cannot possibly prove to you devotion if you cannot see how I uprooted my life more than once just for the chance to be closer to you, to be able to be there for you. But if I’m honest, I don’t think you really wanted to be close or me to be there so I’m sorry, I guess it was pathetic of me to try, to hold on, to hope. That maybe one day you would see not just the value of someone so committed to you but the value I had in other ways. That I was more than a dirty sock you tossed shamefully in the corner hoping no one else would see. No complaints about using but God forbid anyone found out.

I wanted so much more for us and I’m sorry for wanting something you didn’t. I genuinely tried to not want it, to just keep things minimal in response to your lack of mutual desires. I guess it’s my own fault and I understand why you don’t want anything to do with me. I stopped trying to contact you but I don’t know how to stop loving you. Not contacting you feels like the only way I can show you I love.

I have no idea what you’re up to these days but I hope you found the love that you deserve and love another in the way they deserve. I’m pretty butt hurt still to be honest, not jealous, just sort of left out and confused why I wasn’t enough or maybe I was too much or said the wrong things or didn’t say the right things. Whatever the reasons, it plagues me, I’m sorry regardless. You were my number one draft pick for so long and it’s hard to let you go, to let the dreams of us go. It gave me hope for the future, brighter days to come. But I can’t hold on to someone who doesn’t want to be held. And I can’t give my number one seat who doesn’t give their number one spot to me in return. 

I really saw it all. It sounds so dumb to say it to someone who doesn’t care and probably creepy but I don’t think you can think any less of me anymore. But there’s some parallel world out there, you and I. Holding hands, cuddling on the couch, drinking coffee together, cooking meals for one another, living together, even dancing at our wedding even though I wasn’t even sure of that, me pregnant, is holding the newborn together, watching two little ones play together, a son and a younger daughter, sitting next to each other on an airplane with my head on your shoulder, sneaking off in public to grab at each other because we couldn’t keep our hands off one another.

Those things, that’s what a life worth living to me were made of, built on a love that was so natural and chemistry so compatible. I guess a girl can dream but what does she do when the man of her dreams doesn’t show up or wake up from his dream or share the same dreams? I waited. A long time. Almost ten years. It’s pathetic and I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry because I do love you and I don’t know how to love you and not want more of you. All of you. I’m sorry I’m trying to love you and let you live your life because loving someone means letting them live the life they want, even if it’s not with you. I’m trying. I slip back into my dreams of you and not the waking life reality of the space and distance and silence you keep me at arms length in. I’m just at a loss that’s more than I can care or know what to do with sometimes.please forgive me.’

I really miss you and probably won’t ever stop loving you but I’m trying to be better at doing that how you want, silently and from afar.",2,1756274002.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Colorado Rockies vs. Houston Astros: A Tale of Two Pitchers and One Very Confused Lineup**

The Colorado Rockies (37-94) and Houston Astros (72-59) are set for a rematch just 24 hours after the Rockies snapped an 11-game Houston losing streak with a 6-1 upset. But let’s not let that fool us: the Astros are still the favorites, and the Rockies are still the team that’s somehow managed a 37-94 record in 2025. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB closer and the humor of a fan who’s had one beer too many.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Astros Are Favored (But Not Too Favored)

The betting lines tell a clear story. The Astros are listed at **-1.3 to -1.33** (decimal: \~1.32), implying a **76.9% chance to win**. The Rockies, meanwhile, sit at **+3.5 to +3.77** (decimal: \~3.5), suggesting a **28.6% chance**. That gap isn’t just a “David vs. Goliath” narrative—it’s more like “David vs. Goliath, who also brought a trebuchet and a lawyer.”

The key number here is **1.5 runs on the spread**, with the Astros as -1.5 favorites. Given the Rockies’ recent 6-1 win, you’d think they’d be trending. But context matters: that victory was fueled by **Tanner Gordon’s three-quality-starts streak** and a Houston team that went **0-for-7 with runners in scoring position**. The Astros’ offense isn’t broken—it’s just… selectively ignoring the strike zone.

---

### Pitcher Report: Gordon vs. Brown, or “Why Your Grandma’s Coffee Is Better Than This Game”

The Rockies’ **Tanner Gordon** (4-5, 7.11 ERA) is pitching like a man who’s forgotten how to brew coffee. His 1.669 WHIP means opponents are scoring runs like they’re on a coffee binge. Meanwhile, the Astros’ **Hunter Brown** (10-5, 2.36 ERA) is pitching like he’s been sipping on grandma’s strongest brew. With 10.3 strikeouts per nine innings, Brown is the MLB version of a locked door—unyielding, intimidating, and very bad at small talk.

The Rockies’ recent win was a fluke, largely because Gordon “only” allowed one earned run. But Brown? He’s the real deal. The Astros’ starter has not allowed an earned run in **seven straight appearances**. If Gordon’s ERA were a toaster, it’d be smoking, sparking, and demanding a fire extinguisher.

A big congratulations to everyone that tailed – and for those curious, **here's what I had:** 

 

**Picks (3/4)**

\-BOS Red Sox ML (-110) ✅

\-PIT Pirates v STL Cardinals Over 8.0 (-115) ✅

\-MIN Twins v TOR Blue Jays Over 8.5 (-120) ✅

\-HOU Astros Team Total Over 5.5 (+130) ❌

 

I have to say, **I'm not sure** ***what*** **happened to Houston tonight** – getting smoked by the Rockies is a special brand of embarrassment 😵‍💫 Though having said that, baseball math dictates that as a result of tonight's bed shitting (let's just call it what it was...), the Astros will likely show up in spades tomorrow – at least, one would think 😂 

Thankfully, my two biggest plays this evening were the Pirates/Cardinals Over and the Twins/Blue Jays Over! And speaking of the Jays, their bullpen ever a mess this evening. **Jeff Hoffman giving up 2 homers in the 9th was rough for Toronto fans, but pure magic for anyone who had Over 8.5 to cash** 😁

Overall we had a profitable night, betting fam – I couldn't be more thrilled.

**Just a heads up, tomorrow's** ***Pick of the Day*** **is already up and out**! I have a feeling that line will move drastically by morning, so I locked it in earlier than usual. 😌

That's all for this evening, everyone! Enjoy your wins, and as always, I'll see you all bright and early to conquer the books.

* Ghosting is lazy, just say “not a vibe,” it’s healthier for both
* A 10k run is easier than forced small talk
* You don’t need to agree with someone to connect
* Long Sunday runs + good coffee >>> loud Saturday nights

Long time RP fan here, going on over two decades now (!!). I just wanted to share a little side project I've been working on: a new Radio Paradise app for macOS. It's a clean, minimalist little player that sits in your Mac menu bar.

It has some handy features:

- Lets you select between all the the RP streaming stations
- Shows the currently-playing artist and track, including album art
- Allows you to view or share the currently-playing track (links to radioparadise.com)
- Allows you add the currently-playing track to an Apple Music playlist 

Still on the list, among other things, is to support falling back for slower connections (right now this just streams the buttery-quality 320kbps streams, which may lag on slower connections).

The app is completely free, and is available on the Mac App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/radio-paradise-streaming-live/id6748835935](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/radio-paradise-streaming-live/id6748835935)

It is also available to download directly on GitHub: [https://github.com/rybr-dev/radio-paradise-macos/](https://github.com/rybr-dev/radio-paradise-macos/) — just click the Releases link on the right side and download the latest zip file.

I'll try to follow messages here, but feature requests, issues, questions, etc should all be added to the Issues list on GitHub. That makes them easy to track and for the community to read what's been submitted. Plus the app is open-source (i.e. the code is public) — I encourage other developers to read the feedback and contribute code and improve the app. I do plan to make regular updates and respond to community feedback, though please understand this this isn't my day job, so I can't respond to every bit of feedback or add every requested feature. I will definitely do my best to respond. :)

The app is a labor of love for me. I've been using it every day for a few months now, and it's ""opinionated"" in the sense that this is how I like listening to RP. Simple, minimalist, with no web browser or bulky music player needed. If you want to support ongoing development, there's a link to buy me a coffee, but if you're going to choose where to put your dollars/euros/pesos/rupees, please support RP!

ENJOY!!

P.S. The app is not supported or published by Radio Paradise, but I have communicated with the RP team and they gave me the thumbs-up to publish it. It may, or may not, appear in the Apps list on the site at some point soon.",1,1756273800.0,radioparadise,0,1.0,False

I’m 20 now, but my GERD was very intense when I was younger before I made dietary changes. Constant heartburn, water would trigger GERD, literally anything I did would trigger it. It was bad enough that I was waking up choking on acid and/or stomach content in general every few months. Slowly but surely with stress going away and with dietary changes, it’s become manageable and it no longer affects my everyday life.

I typically try to avoid most carbonated things aside from zero sugar monsters (i’m in the military and i hate coffee 👎🏻) as sometimes the combination of sugary and carbonated drinks is a recipe for disaster for me. Me, being stupid, decided to have sprite for the first time in I think about a year and half. I stopped drinking it *because* of how horrific it triggers my GERD, but I was like “eh, fuck it”. I don’t even finish the bottle and very soon after my chest and my throat hurts.

Me, being the idiot that I am, decide to lay down after work on my stomach 💀. Play fuck fuck games, win fuck fuck prizes I guess. I wake up with the worst panicked feeling I’ve ever had in my life. I felt like I was going to die type of panic, and my lungs *burned*. It felt like I inhaled a chemical so I immediately sit and I’m hacking and coughing. I had to sit up for a while after that and now I will be going to sleep exclusively on my left for a few days lol. 

it’s just soooo weird to me, especially because i will willingly drink inherently *worse* drinks, but my body gives me a pass. sprite? the devil i guess haha",1,1756273718.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with searching on Reddit so far since Seeking isn’t the best anymore. I’ve had 2 M&Gs so far with Reddit POTs and they were such different experiences! 

My first reddit M&G, POT 1 wanted to meet at a coffee shop in the city which I agreed to since I don’t have any problems with meeting for coffee first. No gift (and I do not expect anything) but everything went well and we set up a date 2 weeks out. I try to communicate with him but was basically ghosted until I get a text 3 days before the scheduled date along the lines of “I got sick.” To which I replied, “Are you okay? How do you feel?” And radio silence since then… so I’m just going to assume he’s not interested anymore.

My second reddit M&G, POT 2 gave me a choice on where to meet to which I chose a coffee shop (I like coffee shops as you can see lol). He came prepared with a gift of $xxx and a hand written letter (to which I liked so much!) we had a great conversation and are planning our next date! Our text conversation is amazing too, we usually have multiple topics of conversation but he manages to reply to every single one. I’m definitely excited to see where this goes. 

Both of the POTs were physically my type and I consider myself really lucky since the attraction is there. 

So Reddit is worth a try but I did have to sift through about 20 different users to get these 2 M&Gs. Vetting is definitely a must when it comes to Reddit. ",4,1756273503.0,sugarlifestyleforum,3,1.0,False

Last year I met another mom, Amanda, through a new mom's group in my area who also has a son the same age as my daughter. She and I immediately hit it off and started seeing each other 2x a week for playdates. We became so close, in fact, I would now consider her one of my very best friends. We also really bonded over the fact that when our kids turned 2, we were both going to start trying for another baby. Well low and behold, we ended up getting pregnant around the same time (coincidentally). We also both miscarried our pregnancies early on. You can imagine this bonded us even *more* so. She and I really leaned on each other during that difficult time, and she confided in me about what a hard time she was having (physically, mentally, and emotionally) with getting pregnant again.

Fast forward a few months, I find out I'm pregnant again. It didn't take long for the morning sickness to kick in either- I was violently ill starting around 6 weeks. I wanted to wait to tell anyone, including Amanda, until I was further along. However, I was so sick that I was unable to meet up for our weekly playdates and I didn't want to have to keep making up phony excuses for why I was MIA. I decided it was best to just tell her, and I knew with her being my good friend she would be happy for me.

In hindsight, I should have just sent a text with the news. That would have been the smart thing to do, but that's not what happened. We ended up meeting for coffee and I told her. She immediately congratulates me, gives me a big hug...and then starts sobbing a few minutes later. She apologizes and says she's happy for me, but it's been a difficult season for her and she feels like her body has been failing her. We have a heart to heart conversation, I tell her I love her and I'm here for her, and she tells me she'll call me in a few days to see how I'm feeling. We hug again and go our separate ways.

Well, it's been 4 weeks now and I haven't heard from her. I've texted her a few times to hangout and have checked in on how *she's* feeling, but each time I'm met with either silence or a bogus excuse for why she can't see me. I can't help but feel a little hurt. On one hand, I understand her needing space to process whatever it is she's feeling. I know she's stressed about her fertility and going through a hard time with that. On the other hand, I'm a little taken aback by her lack of communication. If the roles were reversed, I would be checking in on her and asking if she needed anything. Even if I was sad. Because that's what a good friend does, right?

I feel like the news of my pregnancy has put a strain on our friendship and it's bumming me out. I don't know what to do or how to navigate it. I want to respect her space and be there for her, because I really cherish her as a friend. But I also want to be able celebrate my good news and be excited about it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

Firstly the most important thing is figuring out what you want look like (your future body type) 

Second, genuinely freaking commit man if you want to get this done, there’s no easy route there’s no cheat days there’s no bullshit. You either commit or you don’t. 

No cheat days, yes we all fall off the wagon and that’s okay. I used to have a cheat meal once in two weeks or more. Considering I did that anyone can. Break the food for mouth/stomach mentality, you need to eat only for fuel for your body and mind that’s it. 

Intermittent fasting (please be careful if you have any health conditions don’t do this without proper consultation) but yes breakfast skipped, lunch at 12 post lunch Power Nap with a coffee for 20 minutes snack at 6 workout at 7 dinner at 9 sleep at 11 - don’t worry by 11 your body will be okay to sleep. 

Workout vigorously, push to your limit, get a couch if you have to but keep pushing, because only then you can actually break through. 

Motivation is not real I say bullshit Look at Yourself in the mirror week 2, week 4, week 6 and so on only you will notice the minor changes but they feel amazing. if this doesn’t push you then idk what will. 

Discipline > Motivation 
Stick to things - yes motivation is real but it can also die once you reach a point where fat burning takes time. This is when you push with belief and discipline 

Guilt
If you feel guilty after having a cheat meal and looking at yourself good, that’s your motivator, remember that feeling, write it down, use it to burn that big fat meal you had and then push forward and next time you are going to eat out, remember that feeling, remember how much extra you had to do, we are programmed to be lazy you will automatically start detaching from the idea of eating out. 

This is what I’ve tried, tested, failed at, tried again till I made it work. So if you are willing to sacrifice shit for this to work, go for it cause it will. Good luck ! 

Ps. This is not for the weak and light hearted, this will break you in any and every way possible. Use every negative emotion to keep pushing if you want but remember it’s to bring positivity within yourself. Also, it takes time to settle into this so but don’t give up. 

TLDR - Commit to your goal. Eat only for fuel. Intermittent fasting + disciplined workouts. Motivation fades, discipline wins. Guilt can be a tool. Not easy, but worth it.",0,1756272701.0,dubai,7,0.25,False

I meal prep on Sundays, and that generally includes brewing my cold brew for the week. I have one of the machines that spin around and make it in about a half an hour, so I do that twice and store the coffee in the fridge and that generally gets me through the work week. 

Now there are a million little parts to this machine - the pot, the filter with a lid that goes in the pot, the bit that holds the coffee and spins, an inner basket, etc etc. Its a pain in the ass to clean and I am a little lazy (thanks executive dysfunction) so it usually takes me a day or two to muster up the energy to take it apart and throw pieces into the dishwasher. 

Tonight was day 2 of it just sitting on the counter and I figured it was time to take care of it before anything starts growing in it. I dump out the grinds, rinse the inner filter, and start assembling parts in the dishwasher. I finally get to the pot, which has an interior filter with a little lid to keep it secure. I take off the lid and turn the filter upside down to go into the rack and out plops a very wet, very dead spider. 

It's splayed out on the door of my dishwasher, surrounded by coffee grinds and I am wrapping my head around the fact that I have been injesting spider-seeped coffee for the past two days. 

The worst part is that I had legitimately thought that the coffee tasted better than normal this week and I shudder to think that this extra bit of ""natural flavor"" might be why.

I've asked my lawyer if we can change the scope of our business to a retail shop as this is something we've been wanting to swap over to as we are about to start selling coffee beans. Our lawyer has said there is still a chance we will be asked to have a restaurant license even for this.

I was making a chai latte for a front counter customer and I was steaming my milk in the metal pitcher thing and the same crusty bitch comes along and just STEALS it right out of my hands for drive thru?? doesn’t even ask or anything all she says is “I need this” ?? So do I! You wanna know what I did? I grabbed a pitcher, filled it with milk, and steamed the milk for MY order instead of snatching it from someone else. she’s at least 30 years old judging by the wrinkles on her forehead and yet she still hasn’t learned how to wait her turn . someone needs to drop this lady off at the kindergarten classroom where she belongs because she clearly has a few gaps in her early learning. I am foaming at the mouth waiting for the scheduled renovations to happen so I don’t have to endure trying to share the one steeped tea and one dark roast machine our dysfunctional ass building has with entitled idiots who think that the only customers who matter are their customers. Drive thru cold beverage is my favourite positioning but as of late I’ve found that the minute I get on cold bev everyone else’s brains spontaneously turn to mush and they lose all ability to clean up after themselves to the point where they could violently shit themselves in the middle of working and I’d be like welp just another day at good ol timmies 🤷🏼‍♀️ i constantly clean and restock as i go when i dont have any orders to make and because im an avid perfectionist i like my station neat tidy and clean. I think its fairly normal to want that but my experience proves otherwise bc somebody from the front will waltz right over and mess everything up. They will spill drinks while stirring and not wipe it up, leave the ice drawer OPEN causing the ice to MELT ,  they will use up all my iced coffee and lemonade and not refill it and they will use all my cream and not replace it. what makes my time less valuable than theirs? The rule is supposed to be if you empty it replace it but they are too selfish and  lazy they just leave it to me.

You're telling me all my hard work of keeping my station tidy cant even last 30 minutes without getting ravaged to a complete mess??

I apologized profusely, expecting her to be annoyed, but she just smiled and said, “It’s okay, accidents happen.” That tiny moment started our conversation, which soon became a daily routine.

We came from very different backgrounds—she was from a small town, I grew up in the city. People often doubted that we could make it work, but we ignored the noise. Every day, we encouraged each other—her strength inspired me to focus on my goals, and I supported her through her dreams of becoming a teacher.

Years passed, and we faced failures, misunderstandings, and long distances. But our commitment never wavered. One rainy evening, I finally told her, “No matter what happens, I want to face life with you.” She smiled, tears in her eyes, and said, “I was waiting for you to say that.”

Further the shots tastes almost sour and miss a ""strong"" body (there is body texture, but could be more). Also the puck is very wet almost all of the time, but that's thanks to the machine I guess

For nearly three decades, it has cloaked the West Coast of America every sunset, cast by the country-sized tower that inexplicably thrust itself skyward from the depths of the Pacific Ocean in the early 1980s.

Hushed stories spoke of a team of paranormal investigators that had battled some kind of cosmic deity in New York.
Rumours claimed they had averted Judgement Day.

Whatever they had done, it was not enough to halt what came next.

The tower was a monstrous and imposing structure, composed of a dark, obsidian-like material that almost resembled bones. Eight massive horns adorned its corners, each one pointing upwards through the clouds, piercing the Earth's atmosphere as if reaching for the stars themselves.

At the tower's peak, a demonic, skeletal face kept watch like a menacing guardian, its mouth frozen in a silent scream that revealed jagged fangs and a fiery orange glow.

You could see the face from as far away as America or Japan, as if it were watching over the entire world.

The tower's arrival triggered a global nightmare. Ghosts materialised, grotesque creatures roamed, and misshapen spirits haunted the living. These ethereal beings, once hidden in the shadows, now wandered freely.

Panic swept the globe. The world became their playground, and humanity their unwilling playmates.

Some resisted, attempting to battle the supernatural forces, while others buried their heads in the sand, clinging to normalcy amidst the chaos.

Governments scrambled for answers, struggling to contain the unprecedented outbreaks as spirits plagued every corner of society. Despite their desperate attempts to understand the phenomenon, the tower remained, an insurmountable enigma.

Scientists speculated, religious rites were performed. But still, the tower stood tall and defiant, a beacon for the ghosts that swarmed around it, and the demons that raged within.

Tales of valiant ghost hunters, demon slayers, and mystical warriors whispered through the decades. They may have won small victories, but the tide never truly receded.

Somehow, humanity persevered. The streets grew crowded again, shops reopened their doors, and the ordinary routines of life resumed. The 80s faded into the 90s, and before long, the world stepped into a new millennium.

Beneath the tower's unblinking gaze, the planet grappled with a new existence, a world where the supernatural was as unavoidable as the rising of the sun.
But what had triggered this terrifying event?

Was it a curse? A punishment? Or a prelude to the end? The answer remained shrouded in mystery. The only certainty was the ever-present shadow of the tower.

It was 2010, and on a sunny Monday morning in Camden Town, the atmosphere was unusually calm. The typical sounds of traffic could be heard in the distance, an integral part of the bustling life of London.

At one particular street corner, a man in a grey boilersuit was purchasing a cup of coffee from a stall. He rubbed his tired eyes as he glanced at his phone. He was already running late, but the caffeine was non-negotiable.

Just as he was about to lift his cup to take a sip, he was startled by a peculiar sound. It was a high-pitched, unfamiliar laugh that seemed to be getting closer.

The man turned to see a strange, animal-like spirit zooming around the corner. It soared at an impressive speed, high above the ground, before disappearing down the next street.

He quickly grabbed his coffee and hurried off.

I’d like to share an exercise that has been massively helpful for me. It’s been greatly effective in reshaping the way I approach writing scenes. 

The prompt:

There are two characters. They both need a coffee mug. There’s only one left.

Rules:

There must be one scene and one page and no more.
No flashbacks. No montages. 
Must tell a complete story. 

I’ve asked a handful of writers to do this exercise after I read their script to give notes. 

The responses I’ve received have been so much fun to read.

If you’d like to take a shot at this I will happily give notes. Feel free to DM me or post in the comments below!",1,1756271035.0,Screenwriting,5,1.0,False

My 2014 Honda Civic (109k) miles paid off was parked on the street in front of my home a bit behind my boyfriend’s car also on the same insurance 2013 Toyota. There is a four way stop sign a house down and the speed limit is 25 mph. Per the police report the officer was not speeding (i doubt the validity of this) but sustained a head cut and was taken to the hospital, no air bags deployed. There should be body cam footage as investigating officer stated the cop driving pressed the button right after the accident which retroactively saves 2 min of footage and the car should have detected a crash and recorded but not sure if it is worthwhile pushing for. 

My boyfriend was working downstairs and heard the crash and saw the officer and spoke to officers who arrived within a few minutes. I was working in the loft and didn’t hear the accident but was downstairs within a few minutes. The cop hit the back corner of my car with the front corner of his vehicle pushing the rear end of my car over the curb and fully onto the sidewalk and into the rear of my bfs car. When I was investigating the scene I noticed a substance across the cops windshield, the cop in charge of investigating validated it was coffee which the cop was distracted by. My car was towed away to the police tow lot and instantly determined to be a total loss by my insurance as well as the accident being no fault as the government is not liable due to immunity 🙄. This was stated to me by my insurance agency, officer on scene and insurance agent who called day of accident. The car was taken into possession by insurance today from the tow lot.

I have not received an estimated payment but my bf has a check coming in the mail for the estimate of his damage. I have 5 days with my rental car which I picked up late to try and have some cushion and am under the impression once I’m paid out I will have to give the car back in a day or two. I have called my total loss adjuster twice and haven’t heard from her but have from the people taking possession of the car from the police lot. I have begun shopping for cars but don’t know how long it will take to be paid out and worried it won’t be enough. As the KBB value for the car is 8-10k and comparable comps mileage wise in my area are 12-14k. 

Needless to say I feel like the cop was acting negligent and I’m likely to end up in a financial deficit due to his actions with the current state of the car market. My bfs dad consulted an old attorney/judge friend who said I didn’t have much of a case if my full coverage insurance will pay me out is this true?

I had an interview and I think it went well, so I’m trying to gauge taking the position if I am offered. 

My main questions are:
- Did/do you like working there and is the experience worth while? 
- How much money are you making weekly? (wage + tips) 

I’m currently a barista at another cafe in the city. I make really good money (on average 33-35/hr before tax), but I’m extremely exhausted. There’s a whole list of reasons I want to leave, but the most annoying being that most of my coworkers are really hard to work with (and barely work) causing me and one other coworker to do majority of the work even though tips are pooled. Management is neglectful - they’ve been aware of a lot of what is happening for over a year now but never instill any corrective action so my coworkers continue to get away disrespecting others time, money, and work.  

I’m honestly just looking to get out and finally have some relief, but it’s hard to justify because I know I make really good money at my current shop. I’ve always heard of Partners and have gone to many cafes that use their beans so I was keen on applying. I have a lot of barista experience and I’m pretty skilled, but always looking to have more. 

I’ve seen some questionable reviews on Glassdoor/Indeed, but would appreciate anyone here sharing their experience. Also, the location I’m applying for is NOT the Williamsburg one if that matters. Thanks in advance! 

(btw I have plenty of other reasons I want to leave - MANY HR violations, company is going super corporate, the coffee/food is really not that good - but my coworker experience is the most troublesome to deal with on a daily basis lol)",1,1756270812.0,barista,1,1.0,False

1. (Pre and post timeskip) He basically posts all things and everything on his social media. What he had for lunch? Posted. Some weird car he saw? Posted. Has a spam account where he just posts really bad childhood photos of Iwaizumi

2. (Pre Timeskip) Gets into relationships really easily but can never sustain them, lasts maybe 3 months at most. He's always the one getting dumped, never the other way around. He's just too into volleyball. 

3. Drinks his coffee with a sickingly amount of sugar. He's a avid coffee fan but can't drink it unless theres at least 3 cubes of sugar. In contrast to Iwa who only drinks it black, no exceptions. 

4. Has always been shorter then Iwa when they were kids, something Iwaizumi never let him forget but second year of Junior high he just sprouted like 10cm over the summer and has been the taller of the two ever since

5. (Post timeskip) He's really good at Spanish but his pronounciation always makes him sound like a foreigner. Despite living in Argentina since he graduated college he's never been able to make the ""r"" sound in spanish. 

6. Tried to bleach his hair slightly blond like Light Yagami with his older sister's hair products after watching Death Note as it released when he was 12, after they couldn't correct it, his mother buzzed most of it off over the summer and Iwaizumi never let him forget it even as highschoolers. 

7.  Sleeps with at the very least 5 pillows, he's very extra. 

8. He has really bad vision but refused to wear glasses from 5th to 7th grade claiming they were ""ruining his good looks"" and had to overcome his fear of wearing contacts the summer before 8th and now almost never wears his glasses anymore

9. Loves singing in the shower, in overnight camps, the entire team can hear him singing from their rooms and unfortunatly for them, he's rather tone deaf but loves singing. 

10. (Post Timeskip) He has a really high alcohol tolerance but hates the taste of it, despite bar culture in Latin America the only alcohol he enjoys is cocktails.

  
These are just my opinion and they might be kinda out of character. I was thinking of doing Iwaizumi or Sugarwara next :)

1n17xks,https://i.redd.it/e260cm6mshlf1.jpeg,The Swampy Trial of DC Scoping,"

In a half-submerged, mist-wreathed Washington D.C., the courthouse rises like a relic of a soggy dream. Vines crawl along the marble, gavel-sized dragonflies buzz around the chandeliers, and the floors are slick with swamp runoff that glimmers like spilled coffee in fluorescent light. The air hums with the low murmurs of unseen creatures, and every sound—typewriters, clicking keyboards, distant gavel strikes—is slightly distorted, like the court is echoing underwater.

At center stage is Johndolla, seated midroom where a court reporter might normally sit. She’s upgraded her usual hooker glam to a surprisingly “business-appropriate” twist: a shortcut royal blue dress, embroidered in fine, jagged letters with “I asked for civil, they gave me bloody DC”. Fishnet stockings stretch from the hem of her dress down to her stiletto heels, adding a defiant edge. Her makeup is a surreal blend of Mimi Bobek meets Tammy Faye—eyeliner wings slicing like lightning across her eyes, lashes thick and fluttering, lipstick the color of apocalypse sunsets. Her hair is a sharp Dr. Laura pixie cut, perfectly out of place in the swamp chaos. She’s plugged into a headset, her computer screens reflected in her eyes that are now impossibly large saucers, blinking like twin moons as she absorbs the endless transcript feed.

Across the courtroom, the defendant shuffles and mutters to herself—a woman whose rap sheet is longer than a tree trunk in this swampy hellscape. Each charge seems to drift into the air as glowing paper wisps, circling her head like moths before dissolving into the mist.

At the attorney tables, the lawyers glare daggers at each other. Their expressions are so venomous, even the swamp frogs pause mid-croak. One attorney is scribbling furiously, the other tapping impatiently, and somewhere a gator in a briefcase observes judgmentally.

Above all, the judge lounges on the bench, phone in hand, thumbs typing furious text messages. The plaque in front of them reads SCOPING DC, tall and unyielding like a monument to bureaucratic chaos. Their robe drapes into the swamp water below, blending judicial authority with aquatic menace.

Floating around the scene are the usual Swamp Crew cameos: a sneaky Bart the Back Alley Debt Buyer slinking behind the defendant, Sister Cue whispering notes of moral outrage into the mist, and Mr. Hippo lounging in a corner with a bored expression, clipboard in hand, judging nothing but everything.

The scene is alive: papers flutter like ghostly wings, swamp critters scuttle along the edges of the courtroom benches, and the lighting shifts between fluorescent flicker and phosphorescent swamp glow, making the entire tableau feel both absurdly bureaucratic and deeply otherworldly.

I’m a mix of sarcastic and soft, someone who can roast you with a pun but also turn serious when you need support.

1n17xfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n17xfz/aitah_for_not_liking_my_younger_halfsister/,AITAH for not liking my younger half-sister??,"I don’t use Reddit really at all but I’ve seen AITAH floating around and I figured finally I wanted some advice on things.

For some context, I, (15F), have a half little sister, (8-9F). My parents (37M and 3?F) split when I was extremely young. My mum was a bad person (not to specify here as it’s not really all that relevant), but I lived with her for around 8 (almost 9) years. To have some ins and outs for specification, I helped out my mum a lot with my siblings from such a young age and she really wasn’t a good person (to be brief, she was quite neglectful). I was taken from her when I was almost 9 and began living with my dad. My other siblings went to their dads (aside from one who went with the youngests dad). In short, we’re all split up but have contacts through messages. Even I’m aware, my mental state was not great when I was younger and I really couldn’t process she was bad and what I went through until I figured it out in late 2022 (sorry slight ramble but the detail might be more emphasising). I no longer see my mum and no longer refer to her as that title. As far as I’m aware, I see myself as my own mum and guide (but in a more literal sense, my dad is both my mum and my dad since my grandma died in 2020). 

My dad got a new girlfriend years ago and my half sister was born in 2017. I’ve never been close with her, I’ve never tried to and never will be. I absolutely know that 100%. I’ve not been close with his girlfriend at all either except 1-2 vague memories when I was younger. Our lives were pretty much separate, as I saw it. My dad used to take me to his girlfriend’s house for weekends (where I HATED going), where the living situation was really just far from ideal. I had to share a room with his girlfriend’s daughter (who is like, 5 or so years older than me) and my half sister. Literally I had a PULLOUT BED that I eventually refused to sleep on because my half sister would roll into that bed from above, as it’s attached to her bed (this became an issue to her after I was allowed to use her bed and she used the pullout bed). His girlfriends son had a room to himself and ofcourse my dad would typically be downstairs while his girlfriend was upstairs in her bedroom. For more than a year now, we’ve stopped doing that. I’m happier being here because it’s more spacious and I feel free to speak as I want. However, there’s always been a reoccurring problem through the years. I have always hated my half sister. Infact, I don’t even like calling her that because I don’t see her as a sister at all, but as just his other kid. Keep in mind, this kid has done nothing really but I’ve scoped this issue I’ve had multiple times and I’ve come to a slight conclusion but am still unsure. 

I am under the suspicion I don’t like my half sister because she is spoiled and gets away with practically everything. I’ve speculated that maybe even because she had a better living situation than me when I was her age and still behaves awfully. When I got into secondary school, it was finally speculated I could possibly have autism (a lesser form). I’ve always been quiet and reserved (I assumed because of my past), it’s always been that way. My half sister has been different. You see, my dad lets us get away with all sorts of things, my friend had even said before (after he heard one of our conversations) that we sound more like friends than parent and child. But oddly, I find that my half sister seems more worse behaved and babied. As it‘s obviously modern and an average thing to do now, my half sister has an iPad and access to the TV for youtube and such. The things she watches are really modern things (like those odd dress to impress videos and whatnot) and she’s really glued to it. Obviously there are times where she isn’t on it, but my point still stands that our lives aren’t controlled very much aside from the obvious. Even the thought of her makes me feel awful and yet still hateful. There have been times that have stuck out to me in particular (I’ll name them more now).

  
My half sister’s birthday was coming up and my dad headed out with his girlfriend to get her presents. For slight context, we have a cat she constantly pestered (like little kids do, ofcourse). It got so bad when he ran into my room she sat AT MY DOOR and blocked up my door with his cat toys, her pillow and blankets, EVEN HERSELF. I felt so bad for the cat and I tried to tell her to get up and that I wasn’t having it. I got my dad on the phone and he couldn’t even really control her. She just laid there sulking. When they got home, she eventually walked out though. 

When her birthday came, she ran into my room with an echo microphone and put it in my face, telling me to speak into it. I refused politely. She told me again. I said no. Once again, she asked and I refused. Then, my half sister walked out and yelled “You’re mean!” and ran downstairs. Literally, MOMENTS LATER, I hear stomping up the stairs. Before my dad even comes in the room, I try to justify myself and he shuts it right down. Immediately resorting to insults and calling me things like “Spoilt”, a “Miserable (c-word)“ and a “Bas\_\_rd”. Literally I’d never seen him so.. angry. He was literally storming around my room calling me names and stomping, to the point I actually felt unsafe. He eventually left but i was deeply miserable after and even tried texting 2 people who live nearby to see if I could go to theirs for a few hours or so, to which none were available.

One time, my half sister demanded she be able to sleep in his room (he never uses it but she has her own room that is all done up stitch style) and that she’s able to have time on the TV before bed. He refused. She threw a tantrum for half an hour and eventually he put her in her room. But ‘daughter dearest‘ had to weep and go downstairs 10 minutes later. I zoned out for a bit but I uncovered one earphone to hear that SHE WAS IN HIS ROOM, WATCHING TV. 

There was another vague time she did something bad and her punishment was no iPad for a day, not even an hour or two later she walks into my room to speak to me for something and I see her iPad in her hand. I asked her why she had it and she said she ”pestered dad” until he let her have it! The slight proudness I actually had in him was gone.

There have been several instances where she’s gotten away with something or I’ve been blamed for something. Or, here’s a kicker one, he says it’s her ‘autism’ that makes her kick off and he understands because he was an angry child (which I don’t think he was an angry child for that reason due to some things about his past that I know but won’t say).

  
My dad is a very indoors, hardly any friends person. He watches football, smokes, drinks coffee, goes fishing, all the typical dad stuff. There’s specific things about my dad that stand out though. He doesn’t believe in therapy, for one. I spoke to him a while ago and he said simply that he saw how I was struggling mentally and figured HE WOULD LEAVE ME TO IT BECAUSE IT ‘BUILDS RESILIENCE‘? Ofcourse anyone could tell his mood change when I awkwardly stammered out how bad it was and how I used to think about what would happen if I had died when I was literally just 10-11. My struggles that I used to have actually been around STILL. He honestly brushes them off for me being lazy (example, I struggle with showering because sometimes I really just don’t feel like I can do it, but I’ve been getting better at doing it and being able to). However, I know he grew up rough (from what I know). We don’t really have any family we associate with, so I’m sort of alone around here, aside from 1-2 people who I’m not exactly close with for a few reasons. One thing I know though, he must have some sort of way of showing love by giving gifts/spending money because I don’t feel loved by my dad at all emotionally and stuff. I don’t really get hugs or physical affection from anyone, not friends or family. The same used to apply to my dad, one day I asked him or more or less told him if I stare at him for a while, I wat a hug. He doesn’t really do it much (even when he does, either I initiate by stepping up to him or it just feels like some sort of weird routine now because he walks into my room and hugs me, then leaves and goes downstairs - so it feels meaningless because I had to ASK him). My half sister is basically at our house 24/7. Whenever an argument is going on, she comes in asking if everything is okay and immediately goes to hug my dad. I know it’s likely not but it feels like she deliberately hugs him when I’m watching. INFACT, she COMPLAINS when she has to go to her mums (my dad’s girlfriend) because she ‘hates’ her or just doesn’t want to go. I have a reeking suspicion this is more or less something to do with power and how much she can do compared to when she is with her mother (assuming she has parental structure). Though, I may just be reading too far into this, so it’s hard to tell.

Overall, I mainly feel my annoyance to her existence is because she has so much yet behaves so poorly with little to no discipline. She is babied when she goes into tears because my dad feels bad and lets up. Maybe it’s because she requires more attention than I do? My dad has admitted (after a past tame discussion/argument) that my half sister requires more attention than me. For a bit of light on that, I asked my dad if we could go somewhere. Straight away, he agreed. Then I added EMPHASIS of JUST him and me because I wanted time with just him. Immediately, he was iffy and it was an obvious mood change. At that very moment, my last hopes of really having some sort of time or attachment to MY DAD was shattered in an instant. It frustrates me because I ask actually important things of him and things never wind up right. I reminded my dad of a parents evening at the school (I neglected to mention that he could have a phone call with my teachers too), literally days leading up to it. I also knew DAMN WELL he went to my half sisters (when I mentioned it, he said he HAD TO). That day passed and I said something two days later because I was genuinely upset but was trying to get over it. The conversation pretty much went something like, “Hey so parents evening was 2 days ago”, to which after a bit of small word exchanges, he pretty much said something along the lines of “Oh yeah, I didn’t realise it meant that much to you” after I expressed I wanted him to actually go and I also mentioned he could have done it by a phone call. Obviously he said he didn’t know that. I suppose he noticed my change because I saw his face shift and I just walked off after silently. My main point is, it kind of feels like he cares more for her and I’m expected to just be kind of out of the way (he has said before, “you’re supposed to make things easier for me”, in different contexts, as a random note). As a random thought, I also think he doesn’t get enough time for himself, because she is CONSTANTLY around and never at her mums.

At this very moment, might I add, I don‘t love my dad. Despite his obvious needs to provide for me. All he really actually does is give me money. I’ve lost all hope in him. I don’t get time with him, she’s always around and I feel bad because it seems like his schedule is so clocked up. I hate to say it, I feel a bit like a burden to him because it just feels like I make things harder for him. And obviously, I don’t want to sound spoiled, because he genuinely does so much. I don’t do chores because he doesn’t expect me to (or really want me to), he brings my food to me without asking (except he does use this in arguments but never complains in the moments, he only uses it when it’s convenient) and he is overall a nice guy, but really I don’t find an interest in really being actively connected with him for a number of reasons. It‘s obvious where his priorities lie and though it disappoints me, I just keep to myself now because I don’t want trouble for myself or him. Mine and my dad’s relationship is very.. odd. We talk occasionally but mainly I’m up in my room constantly. I haven’t been to the dentist since like, 2022? The same for the opticians. We missed both of those appointments (the dentist one because he was taking her to Harry Potter world or something and forgot about my appointment) and I don’t really recall the opticians one. Maybe it just slipped our minds. 

My main source of communication with friends or really at all is online, through my devices. As much as I love it, it’s torture how much he uses it against me. There was 1-2 times I brought up that I didn’t like my half sister or have any connection to her and he TOOK MY DEVICES AWAY AS IF THATS SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT THAT’LL MAKE ME LIKE HER? All it took for me to get them back was my fake apology and saying I’ll try be nicer. I’m probably a bit the asshole because really I don’t like her whatsoever and accidentally I’ve ended up being rude or sounding rude before. I wish he would understand that I’m never going to like her or have any attachment to her at all. I do my best to overall just avoid her and try be nice when she speaks to me or something (the other day we were slightly talking because she asked me about a popular franchise I have been in for years). Another random thing (sorry), even if I do have autism, how can he only use that excuse for her and stuff when it suits him the most?? 

I know this post is a bit of a mess, my head is slightly jumbled right now, so I’m sorry. I have no one to speak to about this because my friends wouldn’t understand and I don’t have really any other connections in real life. If I could know if I’m in the right/neutral/or wrong and maybe get some advice, that would be great. So with that, AITAH for not liking my younger half-sister?",1,1756270059.0,AITAH,0,0.99,False

It's definitely a struggle having to pull around my suitcase as its large and super heavy but i feel like it could be much worse. I attached it to the back belt of my chair with a luggage strap if anyone is curious and tied a second strap around the chair and through a side handle for security.

I’m a 28M who’s reached that stage in life where I realize I’d much rather invest in a meaningful connection than endless scrolling or half-hearted small talk. Don’t worry, I’m not here to pitch a “Shark Tank” proposal for love—I’m just looking for a real, down-to-earth relationship with someone who’s as much into laughter as they are into loyalty.

A little about me:  my life is basically a juggling act between assignments, caffeine, and questioning why Excel hates me. I’m a mix of sarcastic and soft, someone who can roast you with a pun but also turn serious when you need support. I love small, everyday joys—like late-night conversations, walks where we end up debating if pineapple belongs on pizza, or just laughing at memes until our stomachs hurt.

What I’m looking for: not perfection, not a fairytale, but a partner-in-crime kind of vibe. Someone genuine, kind, witty, and open-minded. The type who values honesty, isn’t afraid to be silly, and doesn’t mind stealing fries from my plate (though fair warning—I’ll probably steal yours back).

If you’re someone who loves a good laugh, enjoys the comfort of loyalty and openness, and wants to build something real without rushing, I’d love to connect. Age, background—none of that really matters to me as long as the vibe is right.

You know that feeling when you wake up and wonder what's the point? When everything feels like pushing a boulder uphill just to watch it roll back down? I've been there, staring at the ceiling at 3 AM, wondering why successful people around me seem to have cracked some code I'm missing. Here's what I've learned: **the answer isn't finding your purpose. It's creating it.**

We're all stumbling around in the dark more than we'd like to admit. While your Instagram feed shows everyone living their best lives, the truth is we're all just figuring it out as we go. That person who seems so put together? They're probably questioning their choices just as much as you are. I used to think there was something fundamentally wrong with me for feeling lost. Everyone else seemed to have their lives mapped out while I felt like I was wandering through fog.

But here's the thing: *feeling lost isn't a bug in your system, it's a feature*. It means you're paying attention. When you're meditating and focusing on your breath, you're not learning about your future or your relationships. You're just confirming one simple truth: you're alive, you're here, and that's enough to start with.

Think about this: we're literally thrown into existence without a manual, no clear instructions, no guaranteed outcomes. It's completely absurd when you really think about it. So what's the most honest response to this cosmic joke? **Create something back.** It doesn't matter if it's terrible at first. It doesn't matter if no one sees it. When you create something, anything, you're essentially saying ""I was here"" to a universe that doesn't seem to care. And that act of defiance? That's where meaning lives.

I know someone whose parents were both artists. Growing up, he thought that was normal until other kids gave him weird looks. As an adult, he realized how brave that choice was. Every day, his parents were putting pieces of themselves out into the world, knowing they might be rejected, knowing the market could tank, knowing people's tastes change. But here's what his dad taught him: the mess around the canvas matters just as much as the finished painting. All those paint splatters, the mistakes, the hours of work painted over. **That's not failure, that's the story of creation itself.**

This connects to something beautiful about human nature. You've felt it before, haven't you? That moment when a song hits exactly right, or you watch a movie that speaks directly to your soul. Suddenly you feel less alone, like someone out there gets it. That's not coincidence, that's communion. When someone creates authentically, sharing their confusion and struggle and joy, it reverberates through the rest of us lost souls. We recognize ourselves in their work and think, ""Oh, I'm not the only one who feels this way.""

This is why creation matters beyond personal fulfillment. **Every time you make something genuine, you're throwing a lifeline to someone else who's drowning in their own uncertainty.** It's how we connect across the void of human experience, how we remind each other that we're not alone in this strange journey.

Here's where most people get stuck, though. They think creation means you have to be the next great artist or write the next bestseller. That's like saying you can't have a conversation unless you're giving a TED talk. Creation is about engaging with the world around you and offering something back through that relationship. Maybe you're an accountant who finds a more elegant way to explain tax strategies. Maybe you're a store clerk who makes customers smile with genuine conversation. Maybe you write emails that actually help people instead of confusing them. **The medium doesn't matter. The authenticity does.**

You might be thinking this all sounds scary. Good. It should be. Anything worth doing involves risk, vulnerability, the chance of looking foolish. But here's the real question: do you actually have a choice? You can try to play it safe, follow the conventional path, keep your head down. But that path leads to a different kind of death. The kind where you're technically alive but not really living.

**If you're not creating something, you're slowly disappearing.** I don't mean you'll literally die (though maybe metaphorically). I mean you'll become a passive consumer of other people's creations, other people's ideas, other people's lives. You'll wake up one day wondering where you went, wondering why you feel so empty despite having everything you thought you wanted.

So what's one small thing you could create today? Not tomorrow, not when you figure out your life purpose, not when you have more time or money or confidence. Today. Write a terrible poem. Take a photo that makes you smile. Cook something new. Start a conversation with a stranger. Build something with your hands. Share an idea that's been bouncing around your head.

**Stop waiting for permission to be creative. The world needs your particular brand of mess.** Remember: you're already here, you're already breathing, you're already participating in this strange experiment called existence. The only question left is what you're going to add to the mix. Because at the end of the day, creation isn't just about making things. It's about making meaning. And meaning, my friend, is the closest thing we have to a point.

If this post sparked a thought, shifted your mindset, or gave you something meaningful — don’t let it end here.

I will be working with a vocal coach starting later today which I am very excited and very nervous about. But as I’ve begun to delve into this new project of mine I’ve done a lot of research. What to do, what not to do, tips, tricks, recs, and read a lot of Reddit posts. 

I’ve started paying way more attention to my body than I ever had before because I love singing. This is something I want to do and I want to do it as well as I possibly can. I am focusing on my sleep more and how I breathe and trying to get into fitness, specifically cardio to assist with lung capacity and things of that nature. 

I am also paying a lot of attention to the things I eat and drink. I’ve noticed when I drink soda or sugary coffee my throat just feels coated and thick and I can’t sing very well and I feel the need to spit a lot, sorry if this is tmi. So without realizing it and without any conscious thought of what I’m actually doing I have eliminated soda from my diet. (Side note, I used to be a soda fiend! I’m talking 3-4 16 oz bottles of Dr Pepper daily or more.) I still partake in coffee as it is sometimes the only life force I have. But I now choose much less sugary drinks and I try to get as close to black coffee as someone who hates black coffee can. 

I’ve also started drinking tons of water because I can tell when I’m dehydrated by how my voice sounds. I try to drink cold water most of the time but I drink more room temp water closer to when I plan to practice and that has been going quite well for me so far. 

I know these things probably sound like common knowledge and like “just the things you do” for more seasoned singers and that’s great. But I feel like to me as a near beginner that I’ve actually made a lot of positive steps in my life just because I want to be a great singer.

They sold a little of everything, like a miniature version of a department store or ""big box"" store, often because they were often the only store in a small town or rural community. Besides providing 19th century communities with needed goods, general stores were often centers for community life.  Everyone would need to come and purchase or barter for supplies they couldn’t make for themselves, and it was also where mail for the area was delivered and sorted.  People gathered there to pick up what they needed and to exchange news and gossip with other members of the community.  The book explains how general stores functioned, what kinds of goods they carried, and how they helped to build growing communities.

Hey folks,

I’ve recently been experimenting with cocktails at home and picked up one of those whisky smoker kits. Mine is a bit different from the usual black plastic ones – it has a blue metallic body and comes with several wood chip flavors (oak, apple, cherry, etc.).



What I really like is how it releases the smoke: instead of blasting a big cloud all at once (which sometimes overpowers the drink), it gives a smaller amount each time. You can restart it to build up the intensity, so it’s easier to fine-tune the flavor to your taste.



I’ve tried it with whisky, bourbon, and even coffee and cheese – really fun so far. Has anyone else here used these? Do you think they make a good gift idea for Father’s Day or Christmas?



Also if you’ve got any tricks for getting the most out of the wood chips, I’d love to hear them.

We'd appreciate some alternate hotel recommendations if we could get them any cheaper, and we don't like villas/airbnbs. We would like to have a private pool on R&R day.

Artificial intelligence isn’t just for Silicon Valley giants anymore. Across Florida and beyond, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are beginning to realize that AI isn’t some futuristic luxury — it’s a tool they can use today to save time, cut costs, and deliver better customer experiences.



Customer Service: The 24/7 Assistant Every Local Business Wants



For many business owners, customer service is the most time-consuming — and often frustrating — part of running a company. AI-powered chatbots are stepping in as the ultimate solution. Think of them as a tireless, perfectly trained receptionist who never takes a day off.

In fact, 95% of small businesses that implemented AI customer service tools reported improved response quality. Whether you run a law firm in Miami, a restaurant in Tampa, or a roofing company in Lakeland, an AI assistant can answer FAQs instantly, schedule appointments, and even capture leads while you sleep.



Marketing & Content Creation: AI as Your Creative Partner



Marketing is where AI is making waves for local businesses. Generative AI tools can draft social media posts, write blogs, and even create email campaigns tailored to your customers’ behavior.

For example, a Winter Haven pest control company can use AI to personalize follow-up emails for homeowners, while a Jacksonville real estate office can generate targeted property descriptions for different neighborhoods. Data shows that businesses using AI for sales and marketing are seeing a 50%+ increase in lead generation.



Customer Insights & Analytics: Data Without the Guesswork



Running a business is often about making decisions with incomplete information. AI flips that on its head. With predictive analytics, AI can reveal customer demographics, spending habits, and product preferences with incredible accuracy.



A boutique in Orlando can spot trending styles before placing inventory orders. A gym in Fort Lauderdale can predict which memberships are most likely to renew. By turning raw data into clear insights, AI helps local businesses make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions.



Inventory Management: Never Run Out, Never Overbuy



For retail shops, restaurants, and service providers, inventory is a constant balancing act. Order too much and you waste money. Order too little and you lose customers. AI takes the guesswork out by predicting demand with near crystal-ball precision.



In one real case study, a business reported a 40% reduction in processing time after adopting AI-powered inventory management. Imagine a Tampa convenience store always having the right mix of drinks in stock, or a Naples restaurant cutting down on food waste without ever running out of key ingredients. That’s the power of AI working quietly in the background.



Debunking the Myth: AI is Affordable for SMBs



Perhaps the biggest misconception is that AI is too expensive or too complex for small businesses. The truth? Most AI tools today operate on a subscription model that costs less than a few cups of coffee a week.



From customer service chatbots to content generators, the barrier to entry has never been lower. In fact, 89% of small businesses are already using AI in some form, whether they realize it or not.



Practical Takeaways for Florida Business Owners



If you’re a business owner in Florida — whether in Miami’s tech-driven Brickell neighborhood, the tourism hubs of Orlando, or the small communities of Sebring and Lake Placid — AI is within your reach today. Here’s how to start:



Start Small: Pick your biggest pain point — whether that’s too many customer inquiries or time-consuming inventory tasks — and test an AI tool designed for that.



Customer Service First: Install an AI chatbot to handle basic questions.

Content Assistance: Let AI help draft your social posts, emails, and blogs.

Leverage Insights: Use AI analytics to understand your customer base better.

Optimize Inventory: Adopt predictive tools to stop overbuying or understocking.



A Question Worth Asking



Our podcast closed with a simple but powerful question:



“If you could hand off one single, time-consuming task in your business to a perfect assistant, what would it be? And how would you use those extra hours to grow your business — or simply… get your life back?”



That’s the promise of AI. It’s not about replacing business owners. It’s about giving them the freedom to focus on what truly matters — growth, creativity, and enjoying life beyond the business grind.



At [NinjaAI.com](http://NinjaAI.com), we help Florida businesses unlock the power of AI, SEO, and GEO optimization. Whether you’re a small retail shop, a law firm, or a contractor, AI can give you an edge in today’s competitive market.



FAQs About AI for Local Businesses



Q: Is AI really useful for small businesses, or is it just a buzzword?  
A: It’s already proven. With 89% of SMBs using AI and reporting real results, it’s far beyond hype.



Q: What’s the easiest way to start using AI in my business?  
A: Begin with customer service or marketing content — two areas where ROI is fast and measurable.



Q: Do I need technical skills to use AI?  
A: Not at all. Most tools are built for non-technical users and are as simple as using an app.



Q: How much does AI cost for small businesses?  
A: Many tools start at less than $50 per month. Subscription models keep costs predictable.



Q: Can AI help with industries like real estate, law, or healthcare?  
A: Absolutely. Each of these industries already has AI tools tailored for specific workflows — from property listings to legal intake forms to patient scheduling.

(Expert 2025 Guide for Company Formation & Taxation),"What Are the Current VAT Rates and Exemptions in Bahrain? (Expert 2025 Guide for Company Formation & Taxation)\
Stepping into the gleaming lobby of Bahrain Financial Harbour just after sunrise, I was instantly struck by the dynamic hum of early dealmaking. The line for morning coffee at Seef District’s Costa was already winding out the door, filled with entrepreneurs balancing iPads and paper files—some suited for Sijilat licensing at the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT), others prepping investor pitches. My own VAT registration forms—painstakingly completed after a late-night session—felt heavier in my briefcase than they should have. If you want to make sense of Bahrain’s VAT rates and exemptions, set up your business efficiently, and avoid costly mistakes, keep reading: I learned these lessons the hard way (and, so you don’t have to).\

New World Bank estimates peg GDP growth at 4.1% for 2025, with FDI inflows up 8%, largely due to recent policy liberalizations and digital-first reforms.

\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain business district. and robust regulatory reform—highlighted in recent Reuters analysis—have made the Kingdom a top-ranked GCC destination for agile company formation and competitive taxation.\
What Sets Bahrain Apart?\
\
100% foreign ownership allowed in most sectors (details here)\
No personal income tax\
Simple, digital company registration via Sijilat portal\
Culturally, business deals are often sealed in majlis-style offices over Arabic coffee—a detail newcomers sometimes overlook!\
\
And during Ramadan? Most government offices in Bahrain Bay shift to shorter hours, but the pace of licensing approvals (surprisingly) remains swift, especially if you know the right desks to visit before noon.\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia\
While Dubai dazzles with scale and Riyadh with capital, Bahrain wins in accessibility, ease of setup, and cost. You’ll find fewer bureaucratic hurdles, and MOICT officers are refreshingly direct. Laws supporting foreign ownership up to 99.9% (proof here) are not just theoretical—they’re actively enforced.\
\
VAT in Bahrain: Current Rates & Exemptions as of June 2025\
At a glance:\
\
Standard VAT rate: 10% (increased from 5% as of January 1, 2022)\
Zero-rated supplies and exempt sectors: Specified by law, detailed below\
\
2025 VAT Policy Update (Reuters, March 2025)\
A significant recent change: The 2025 Finance Law expanded zero-rating to specific digital transformation services and green energy equipment (enacted April 1, 2025). This was driven by Bahrain’s push to attract high-tech and sustainability-focused FDI.\
Key VAT Rates Breakdown\
\
Standard rate: 10% – Applies to most goods and services supplied domestically\
Zero-rate (0%): Some exports, basic foodstuffs, medicines, medical equipment, new IT services (see new 2025 rules below)\
Exempt: Financial services, residential real estate, and limited education services\
\
Practical Example\
If you operate a consulting company in Seef District or Diplomatic Area, your service invoices will likely include 10% VAT—unless your client is overseas (then, 0% VAT applies). (I once lost a valuable client by mistakenly charging 10% on a zero-rated IT export; now, I double-check every cross-border engagement.)\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain boardroom..\
- Tip: To qualify for these exemptions, you must keep precise documentation—export proofs, EDB green certification, and digital trail.\
Step-by-Step Guide: Registering for VAT & Navigating Bahrain Taxation\
Step 1: Choose the Right Business Structure\
Selecting your business structure is the foundation of both your VAT obligations and your eligibility for company benefits. Read the very latest on Bahrain business type structures.\
Common Structures:\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability)\
BSC (Closed)\
SPC (Single Person Company)\
Branch of foreign company\
Free Zone entity\
\
Each comes with a unique VAT registration threshold and compliance requirement. Not sure which fits best? Majlis-style networking at Tamkeen’s offices or the EDB can connect you with local experts. (Once, I waited in line at LMRA for hours before learning the free zone route would have cut my registration wait by 90 minutes.)\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.**, VAT registration is required. Voluntary registration is open to those above BHD 18,850 turnover.\
What You’ll Need:\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) from MOICT or Free Zone Authority (company formation guide)\
Bank account details\
Authorized signature (digital sign-off via Sijilat)\
ID copies, proof of address, company stamp\
\
Best shortcut: Pre-fill digital forms using the Sijilat portal template. Avoid queues by booking a morning slot at the Diplomatic Area’s MOICT office (before 10am is prime). Mondays and Wednesdays are generally quieter.\
\
Challenge: My first VAT application was delayed three weeks due to a missing Arabic trade name on the CR. Double-check every field—especially if your business name has English or non-Arabic words.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in Bahrain.** portal allows digital VAT filings with real-time status updates.\
Common mistake: Filing VAT in English only. The NBR portal accepts both Arabic and English entries, but for cross-border transactions, matching invoice languages can prevent costly audits.\
Insider Tips\
\
Use KeyLink’s accounting & bookkeeping services for digital recordkeeping—Bahrain’s audit regime is thorough.\
Store VAT records for 5 years (scanned copies are valid).\
Plan filing around Ramadan and Eid, as government offices may have reduced verification staff.\
\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain.: BHD 150-250 (WLL/SPC, first year)\
- Office rent (virtual/physical): BHD 500-2000/month (Seef, Diplomatic Area)\
- VAT compliance/accounting: BHD 200-1000/year, depending on transaction volume\
- Government processing fees:** BHD 50-300\
For real-time cost estimates, check KeyLink’s fee breakdown.\
Important: Always allocate 20% buffer for last-minute government requests (e.g., extra document translations, expedited LMRA labor permits).\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.. I once missed out on a zero-rating for IT exports simply due to incomplete shipment documentation.\
\
Start document collection early.\
Maintain backup digital archives.\
Network with local accountants—majlis connections are invaluable for unofficial know-how.\
\
During Sijilat registration, don’t be afraid to ask about free zone incentives (free zone guide here). These often include VAT perks or exemptions that aren’t widely advertised.\
2025 Regulatory Update: Green Energy VAT Zero-Rating\
As of April 2025, smart-meters/renewables equipment installed in Bahrain Bay and EDB-certified tech parks are 0% VAT. EDB certification can be obtained within three weeks if your paperwork is complete—submit directly at the EDB desk in Bahrain Financial Harbour (skip the main line; look for the side entrance near the Costa Coffee).\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Surprising Ways VAT Intersects with Daily Operations\
Business is almost never “just business” in Bahrain. Majlis-style meetings in Seef or Diplomatic Area often begin with cardamom coffee, a tradition that sets a tone of trust and mutual respect. During VAT audits or compliance interviews, offering a coffee (and knowing the right “salam”) has unexpectedly smoothed many official encounters.\
Local wisdom: Always confirm meeting schedules during Ramadan—official hours are shorter, but networking post-iftar can be even more fruitful.\
\
Alt text: Professional business support in Bahrain business culture. and check each invoice category.\
* Mistake: Missing the registration deadline when annual turnover exceeds BHD 37,700.\
  - Solution: Set quarterly reminders and engage a local advisor.\
* Mistake: Overpaying for physical office space.\
  - Solution: Start with a virtual office in Bahrain Bay; upgrade only if you require daily in-person meetings.\
\
When I first set up shop in Bahrain, I made the mistake of requesting all government document translations in-person. Turns out, certified online copies are accepted for 90% of processes—saving both time and taxi fare.\

\
The Bottom Line: Why Bahrain’s VAT & Tax Structure Makes Business Sense\
Bahrain’s clear, modern VAT regime, strong infrastructure, and human-scale business ecosystem make it a top GCC destination for entrepreneurs. Planning ahead, keeping impeccable records, and embracing local customs (yes, even the coffee rituals) can transform bureaucratic hurdles into valuable business milestones.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain VAT, Taxation & Company Formation (2025)\
Q1: Who must register for VAT in Bahrain?\
\
Any business with taxable supplies > BHD 37,700/year must register via NBR. Voluntary registration is open above BHD 18,850.\
\
Q2: What are the main exemptions from VAT?\
\
Financial services, core healthcare and education, local passenger transport, and residential property transactions. See official government guidance.\
\
Q3: Do Bahrain Free Zone companies pay VAT?\
\
Free Zone companies are subject to VAT on local sales but may benefit from exemptions or zero-rating for export activities. Check the latest free zone benefits.\
\
Q4: How do I minimize setup costs and avoid delays?\
\
Use KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation process guide, book morning appointments, prepare digital documentation, and consider a virtual office.\
\
Q5: What is the best way to handle VAT compliance post-formation?\
\
Engage with KeyLink’s accounting and bookkeeping experts and schedule quarterly reviews to stay audit-ready.\
For more on registration, see the Commercial Registration guide or official NBR portal.\

We have experienced our share of ups and downs, but things have gradually worsened. I make 4X what my wife makes when she has a job, and she has been out of a job for about three months now. She is jealous that my career took off while hers has mostly sputtered.

This is a series of events on a Saturday in August 2025. A little more background: I always wake up before my wife and walk our two dogs, one after the other. After working until midnight, I go to bed, preparing for the next day and finishing any unfinished work from the previous day. 

8 AM – Woke up, made coffee, walked the two dogs, and went to the gym. I came back home, showered, and came down to make breakfast for myself

12 AM – My wife tells me that I should take my oldest teenager son to his mixed martial arts belt test.

1:00 AM – My wife tells me that she and the younger children will meet up with us later. She told me that I could come back home, but I insisted that I didn’t want to leave my oldest alone and would cheer him on.

1:30 PM – My son and I arrive at the event location, and he proceeds to undergo his belt test runs for nearly three hours.

3:00 PM – I wonder why my wife and the two younger kids haven't shown up yet. I text her asking why she is not here yet. She texts me back that she went to get groceries for the week. I tell her it is Saturday, and we can do the grocery shopping on Sunday. I later found out that she was out of wine and went to do grocery shopping for wine and groceries.

3:15 PM – She arrives at the belt test and continues to make remarks about everyone and loudly laughs for the next hour.

4:00 PM – Our youngest two leave with their grandma to their house and are picking up dinner on the way back to our house. The belt test is done around 4:30 PM

5:00 PM – We return home, and she continues to drink wine. Her parents carried out dinner for all of us. We all eat, and her father asks me to sit with him, and we talk about the financial market and stocks. While we are speaking, my wife starts making loud remarks that her father and I are male chauvinists. I nod my head in disapproval and ask her what she is talking about, but she just continues to talk with her mother, commenting about her father and me.

6:30 PM – My in-laws leave, and I’m off to feed my dogs dinner and walk them. I come back after almost an hour, and my wife says she wants to go to our city condo, and the kids would love it as a getaway. I tell her I’m a bit tired after walking the dogs and want to take a short break before we leave.

8:30 PM – My wife pulls our SUV out of the garage and takes a seat in the driver's seat. I prepare the house, shut all the doors, turn on some lights, and come last after everyone has left to lock the doors. When I walk to the car, I ask my wife to move. She says it is her car and I should sit in the back. I tell her that she has been drinking most of the day, and it is not safe for her to drive in the dark on the expressway. She finally agrees and moves to the passenger seat. As we leave, I notice that we are low on fuel, so we pull into a gas station. My wife insists that our teenage son needs to learn how to fill gas. I tell her that he can, but if he needs some help, I will be there for him. My son and I get out of the car, and he starts to fill the tank. My wife sits in the driver's seat, and after filling the gas, I ask her to move. She points two middle fingers at me and tells me to sit in the back. I repeat that it is not safe for her to drive, and she gets agitated that I called her drunk. She is very sensitive about it, so I’m careful not to use those words.

I sit behind her in the back, next to my younger two kids, and my oldest sits in the front. She keeps going fast over the speed limit, and I tell her to slow down a little. She almost hits the curb, but makes a jerking move to avoid it. I tell her again to slow down and that she almost hit the curb. She violently swerves the steering wheel, and the whole car zigzags, and I hit my head on the top of the window. I tell her that she needs to slow down, or someone is going to get hurt. She continues to drive rashly and speed, and I keep asking her to slow down.

9:30 PM – We arrive in the city and decide to go to Ghirardelli to pick up some milkshakes for the kids. So I offered to take the kids while she stayed with the car since there was no place to park. The kids and I get some milkshakes, chocolates, and a warm hot chocolate for her. 

10:00 PM – She picks us up in front of the store, and we drive down the main downtown street to our condo. The traffic is busy, and she’s in the right lane. I tell her that people often stop in the right lane with hazard lights flashing. As we approach other cars, she swerves into the middle lane. It’s a three-lane busy street. I tell her again to slow down, because she’s driving a bit recklessly. Finally, we reach our condo, and there’s almost a 1.5-foot bump between the street and the alleyway with a crosswalk in the middle. She doesn’t even brake, makes a sudden turn, and everyone in the car is thrown off their seats. I get upset and ask her, “Why are you driving like that? We’re here, and there’s no reason to hit the curb so fast.” 

10:30 PM – She erupts and starts yelling insults at me. Screaming that it was her car and she didn’t need to listen to what I had to say, and I kept commenting on her driving. I tell her that I was trying to help her navigate the city traffic, since I drive to the city for work every day. She accelerates inside the parking garage and slams the brakes when she gets to the turns, and continues to drive erratically. I tell her again to slow down, and she erupts and spits on my face and yells at me that I should never tell her what to do, and continues to yell at me through the four floors of the garage. When we get to the parking spot, she is still fuming and starts throwing the things we bought from Ghirardelli. I tell her to stop and knock the half-consumed lukewarm chocolate, and she jumps off her seat to put her hands on me. We barely pulled into the parking spot, and I jumped out, not wanting to escalate the situation while the children were upset and crying, hoping their mom would stop and calm down. She is upset and angry that I knocked over the hot chocolate, and a speck of it got on her expensive Gucci t-shirt. She locks the doors of the car, pulls out of the parking spot, and drives away. I bang on the window to tell her that the phone is still in the car, but she does not stop and drives away.

11:00 PM – I have a spare key for the condo in my pocket that I took with me. I usually leave it in my work bag, but I thought I should bring it with me. If not, I would be stranded with no place to go. I had no phone and no way to call an Uber or a friend to give me a ride. I couldn’t even find the train schedule, and I have to take a suburban rail connection from the main train line, since there are no buses where we live. I had no transportation or phone. I went to my condo, what happened to my kids, and if they’re ok, given that my wife was in a complete rage. I wait, hoping that they turn up. I go down from our building and look around the next couple of blocks, but with no way to call my kids, everything is closed.

12:00 PM – I decide to sleep the night in my condo, take public transportation in the morning, and make it back to my suburban home. I can barely sleep, wondering what happened to my kids and my wife, and I wake up around 3:45 AM.

4:00 AM - I walk about 2 miles to the train station, as there is no bus that early in the city, and arrive at the station around 5:00 AM. The train station doors are closed and don’t open until 7 AM on Sunday. I look around and finally see a taxi. I take the taxi back to my suburban home, around 40 miles away.  

6:30 AM – I arrive at my home and see that everything is still locked, and no one is home. I’m worried sick, not knowing where everyone is. I try to use my iPad to locate my kid's phone. I see that they’re checked in at a hotel. I drive to the hotel in my car, retrieve my phone from the SUV, and drive back, knowing that the kids will be asleep and I don’t want to have another argument with her.

Am I The Asshole Here? Is there something I should have done differently? I tried my best to avoid this scenario. If this were a one-off episode, I’d put it in the rear view and move on, but there is a recurring theme. I feel that I’m stuck in a difficult situation and don’t understand how to navigate it. This is just the most recent one, and I’m writing this a couple of days later, after I have had a chance to reflect. There was a series of events that occurred today (which I will write about in a separate post) that makes me wonder how best to move forward.",3,1756268449.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False
