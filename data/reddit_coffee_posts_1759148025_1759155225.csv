Everyone claims that ""study consistently"" is as simple as flipping a switch.  It's not, to give you a hint.  The majority of us wait for the ideal burst of inspiration before questioning why we only get two productive days per month.



 Reducing the entry cost is the true trick.  Don't expect four hours of intense work while sipping coffee and listening to low-fidelity music.  Start with something so insignificant that it seems foolish.  Go through one page.  Take care of one issue.  Get the book open.  (Yes, it counts just to open it.)



 The worst part is that momentum will catch up to you if you do that every day.  After sitting for ""just ten minutes,"" an hour has passed.  Sometimes, even ten minutes is better than none at all.  Prior to learning intensity, your brain learns consistency.





 Additionally, it makes the process trackable.  My brain was tricked into not wanting to ""break the chain"" when I began maintaining a visible streak of study sessions, even if they were brief.  Since Studentheon has a small leaderboard feature with friends and displays statistics on how much I've been focussing, it really made this easier for me.  To be honest, I needed the strange kick of being called out for falling down the ranks.



 Therefore, studying every day isn't about working nonstop.  The goal is to get as close to the starting line as you can, then use small victories to gain momentum.

I write here because I need to empty my bag, but also maybe get advice from people who have or have had the same problem as me.

It all started in December 2023, I had a very busy year, physical work + sport (I am a food vendor, carrying loads and handling). I practiced street workout, push ups, pull ups, dips... I reached a stage of 100 traction a day, with no rest during the week. Also in 6 months, I gained weight, I went from 69 kg to 81 (my goal was a mass gain).

In December, when I was doing my usual pull-ups, I felt a sharp pain in my right shoulder. I had to stop completely. After a few days of rest, I resumed the usual training program without changing anything (a big mistake on my part). I had already had some pain and I thought it would pass. So I keep practicing while having this pain. In April 2024, I decided to see my doctor who prescribed me an Arthro-MRI. The results revealed mild tendinitis in the supraspinatus and bursitis. In the same year I was to do my military service. I then decided to hide the diagnosis, I didn't tell anyone and I ""accepted"" to be in pain.

After the diagnosis, the doctor prescribed physiotherapy, in the form of massages (no active rehabilitation and no targeted reinforcements). In July 2024, I was doing my military service, which required an additional physical load on my shoulder.

In November I see an orthopaedic specialist. His diagnosis was as follows (ultrasound): under-adjustment conflict, onset of degeneration of the AC joint due to overuse and overload of the joint (osteoarthritis), again and again tendinitis of the supra-spine, with a positive body cross test. The cause, he also said, was bad posture. With the phrase ""you're young, it must be okay,"" I started a program of rehabilitation/scapular chain strengthening and work in Isometry for the rotator cuff, in order to strengthen the stabilizing muscles of the shoulder didn't help much..

Despite everything, I still feel pain. In January 2024 I was injecting corticosteroids, which relieved me for two weeks. In June, July and August 2024 I did a total of 3 PRP injections, which was the treatment that relieved me the most. Despite this, at the end of September the pain is active again.

I decided to go to another specialist, to take stock but also because I fear for my future and asking myself about a chirurgicale intervention.

In January 2026 I started the police academy. My shoulder will be solicited again. These are the questions I ask myself:

Do I stop everything and have surgery?
Do I continue to suffer pain and have surgery in 3 years (the time of the police academy)
Has anyone had a similar situation?

With all this, there is enormous psychological pressure because I don't want to endanger the rest of my life. I worked hard to get into the academy and now giving up would be a defeat for me.

I've tried any kind of medicine, osteopath, acupuncture. From the beginning I also changed my lifestyle, I completely quit alcohol, coffee, cigarettes. I changed my diet and so on. On the other hand, I use nicotine (snus), 15 to 20 a day, it is the last bad habit I have left to stop.

1ntix18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntix18,Your favorite k-drama couples and why?,"
What are the couples you love and stood out to you the most? Kdramas has so many amazing couples that gives ones butterflies, right? Here are one of my favorites!

Kim Moo Young (Seo In Guk) and Yoo Jin Kang (Jung So Min) - The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

- Not everyone will like this couple because Moo Young is very dark and complex, not a good person. But I love this couple, they have a deep connection and she made him a better person who came to feel things, which he didn’t before .. like pain , love… that’s for me is beautiful. For her, he wanted to be a good person. And their backstory as kids omg how he protected her.. in so many dramas the childhood connection feels SO forced and not needed at all, but here.. it was totally necessary!! Bad boy/good girl Done right, in my opinion

Lee Gang Doo (Lee Jun Ho) and Ha Moon Soo (Won Jin Ah) - Just Between Lovers

- Kind of bad boy/good girl drama too? But at the same time not really. Because while he might be rough on the edges who gets into fights and has this ”bad boy” looks he has a heart of gold with a pure soul. I just adore the relationship of them, it feels SO deep.. how they come to heal each other from past trauma and love each other so so SO much. They are so precious individually and together. It’s a healthy relationship with so much love, gentleness and respect. Also another childhood connection that was Done right and was totally necessary

Sung Deok Mi (Park Min Young) and Ryan Gold (Kim Jae Wook) - Her Private Life

- Look, for me Park Min Young has starred in two dramas with amazing chemistry with both leads, in both of the dramas - amazing couples… relationship goals. I’m talking about Healer and of course this one - Her Private Life. What made me in the end choose Deok Mi and Ryan Gold over Jung Hoo and Young Shin (Healer) was that I felt their chemistry was stronger and they look like the perfect match made in heaven. For a boss - employee relationship it felt surprisingly equal ! The most equal boss - emplyee relationship in k-dramaland i ever seen! He doesn’t abuse his power over her  or whatsoever…because he is a REAL man enough secure of himself knowing damn well how much Deok Mi loves him. And the kisses Ooh gives me butterflies! Unlike the other 2 dramas The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and Just Between Lovers, the childhood connection was not necessary at all. Anyways … amazing couple.

Seo Mun Ju (Jun Ji Hyun) and Baek San Ho (Kang Dong Won) - Tempest 

- ongoing, who knows how it will end… Wow what a intense fierce chemistry 🔥🔥 one of the hottest kdrama couples with best chemistry (my opinion ofc , but i know many think the same !) halleljuah!! 🥵 they make my screen melt! He is her bodyguard with dark past and he is very mysterious.. hiding things from her.. they are SO attracted to each other that in midst of war they cannot help but to loose themselves in each other .. one of the hottest / most passionate scene in kdramaland of all time is between those 2 (might even be the MOST of all time )… i bet he is the first person who ever made her seen as the most precious and  desired woman in the world ..something her late husband was unable to do (he was a mama’s boy after all!) i think this is the most mature/adult  kdrama couple of all time! Its nice to also see a bit older leads in their 40s~

I want to also mention Jang Cheol Min (So Ji Sub) and Ha Jeong Hwa (Han Hyo Joo) - Always

- It’s actually not from a k-drama, but from a movie… but i love them together so much! Lets say, for a 2 hours movie they managed to make a amazing couple better than many couples from 12/16 hours dramas. Their love is so pure, deep, selfless…she is a blind optimistic woman, he is a depressed ex-boxer who falls deeply in love with her and wants nothing more than to protect her… to keep her safe. Ah, so beautiful. The chemistry Between So Ji Sub and Han Hyo Joo is SO good and SO natural. This move is so good that it got remakes from other countries !

There are ofc many more couples in kdramaland I adore ~ the OTPs from Queen In Hyun’s Man, Bon Apetit My Majesty, Flower of Evil, Happiness , Coffee Prince, etc .. so many amazing couples!!

A flash and a shriek in my ears as the grenade went off, disorienting everyone in the room as the room started to fill with smoke. 

Two black tall blast shields flowed through the open doorway, and took defensive positions before opening fire onto the hamburger. The combined 50 cal fire was chipping away at the burger faster than it could regrow. Two more furnaces came in and extracted each one of us one by one. 

Once my vision returned, i realized what was happening. It was the furnace swat team. About 50 of them, not including the two shield wielders inside who were filing back down the stairs. 

 “Ready your weapons! Once that thing gets back up its gonna be an unhappy camper!” I recognized that voice, it was from a long time ago. PoliceFurnace. I got up out of the stretcher and required my shotgun before taking a look around at the others. 

American was being leaded up in an ambulance, along with his severed arm in a cooler. PirateAirconditioner was badly beaten. His fan was bent, his radiators and compressors leaking fluids as the docs tried to bandage him up best as possible. And Gool was not moving, covered with a blanket. Capitalist was long gone. And that youngster was nowhere to be seen. 

A sudden crash came from the Inventory as the front wall was removed as that burger plowed through it and landed on the ground right on top of a swat member. NoTanbl4 was flattened with a wet crunch and squish as the bottom bun turned him into a 2d object. His scream was brief. 

The rest of the fight was brief. All 49 swat members started firing their 50 caliber machine guns into the burger, shredding it. When it all stopped, the burger was a moving mound of meat. 

PoliceFurnace stepped forward, before drawing a 12gauge revolver. With “The Judge” stamped on the barrel. 

“You have been served.” PoliceFurnace stated coldly as a golden 12gauge slug left the revolver and buried itself in the meat. Golden light started to shine from the now immobile monster before a moment of silence fell.

The monster exploded in a wet pop, with hamburger meat strewn for blocks. The force of the blast knocking everyone over. 

Cheers rang out from the officers at the sight of the very dead monster. I tapped the back of one of the swat members who turned around mid laugh, looked at me, stared for a moment, then doubled over and vomited. 

“I know im not that ugly.” I said to myself. That was probably the last of the alcohol talking.",1,1759154705.0,furnaces,0,1.0,False

1ntiww4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntiww4,Your favorite k-drama couples and why?,"
What are the couples you love and stood out to you the most? Kdramas has so many amazing couples that gives ones butterflies, right? Here are one of my favorites!

Kim Moo Young (Seo In Guk) and Yoo Jin Kang (Jung So Min) - The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

- Not everyone will like this couple because Moo Young is very dark and complex, not a good person. But I love this couple, they have a deep connection and she made him a better person who came to feel things, which he didn’t before .. like pain , love… that’s for me is beautiful. For her, he wanted to be a good person. And their backstory as kids omg how he protected her.. in so many dramas the childhood connection feels SO forced and not needed at all, but here.. it was totally necessary!! Bad boy/good girl Done right, in my opinion

Lee Gang Doo (Lee Jun Ho) and Ha Moon Soo (Won Jin Ah) - Just Between Lovers

- Kind of bad boy/good girl drama too? But at the same time not really. Because while he might be rough on the edges who gets into fights and has this ”bad boy” looks he has a heart of gold with a pure soul. I just adore the relationship of them, it feels SO deep.. how they come to heal each other from past trauma and love each other so so SO much. They are so precious individually and together. It’s a healthy relationship with so much love, gentleness and respect. Also another childhood connection that was Done right and was totally necessary

Sung Deok Mi (Park Min Young) and Ryan Gold (Kim Jae Wook) - Her Private Life

- Look, for me Park Min Young has starred in two dramas with amazing chemistry with both leads, in both of the dramas - amazing couples… relationship goals. I’m talking about Healer and of course this one - Her Private Life. What made me in the end choose Deok Mi and Ryan Gold over Jung Hoo and Young Shin (Healer) was that I felt their chemistry was stronger and they look like the perfect match made in heaven. For a boss - employee relationship it felt surprisingly equal ! The most equal boss - emplyee relationship in k-dramaland i ever seen! He doesn’t abuse his power over her  or whatsoever…because he is a REAL man enough secure of himself knowing damn well how much Deok Mi loves him. And the kisses Ooh gives me butterflies! Unlike the other 2 dramas The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and Just Between Lovers, the childhood connection was not necessary at all. Anyways … amazing couple.

Seo Mun Ju (Jun Ji Hyun) and Baek San Ho (Kang Dong Won) - Tempest 

- ongoing, who knows how it will end… Wow what a intense fierce chemistry 🔥🔥 one of the hottest kdrama couples with best chemistry (my opinion ofc , but i know many think the same !) halleljuah!! 🥵 they make my screen melt! He is her bodyguard with dark past and he is very mysterious.. hiding things from her.. they are SO attracted to each other that in midst of war they cannot help but to loose themselves in each other .. one of the hottest / most passionate scene in kdramaland of all time is between those 2 (might even be the MOST of all time )… i bet he is the first person who ever made her seen as the most precious and  desired woman in the world ..something her late husband was unable to do (he was a mama’s boy after all!) i think this is the most mature/adult  kdrama couple of all time! Its nice to also see a bit older leads in their 40s~

I want to also mention Jang Cheol Min (So Ji Sub) and Ha Jeong Hwa (Han Hyo Joo) - Always

- It’s actually not from a k-drama, but from a movie… but i love them together so much! Lets say, for a 2 hours movie they managed to make a amazing couple better than many couples from 12/16 hours dramas. Their love is so pure, deep, selfless…she is a blind optimistic woman, he is a depressed ex-boxer who falls deeply in love with her and wants nothing more than to protect her… to keep her safe. Ah, so beautiful. The chemistry Between So Ji Sub and Han Hyo Joo is SO good and SO natural. This move is so good that it got remakes from other countries !

There are ofc many more couples in kdramaland I adore ~ the OTPs from Queen In Hyun’s Man, Bon Apetit My Majesty, Flower of Evil, Happiness , Coffee Prince, etc .. so many amazing couples!!

Marissa and I have been married twelve years. She’s my best friend, my partner in every sense. We’ve weathered layoffs, infertility scares, and my father’s death. I love her. I really do. That’s what makes this so hard to write.

For months now, I’ve been seeing someone else.

Not just once. Not some drunken one-night stand. It’s been a year. We meet in the same corner café on Wednesdays. I tell Marissa I’m working late.

Her name is Lily. She laughs like a song I forgot I knew. She remembers tiny things—how I take my coffee, the way I tug my sleeves when I’m nervous. With her, the world feels lighter.

It’s not about sex. We’ve never even kissed.

But I know what it is: betrayal.

Every time I come home to Marissa’s tired smile, guilt digs a little deeper. She asks if I had a long day, and I nod. I want to tell her. But I don’t.

Last Wednesday, Lily looked at me and said, “You have to tell her.”

I said I couldn’t. She just nodded, as if she knew this was goodbye.

When I walked through our front door that night, I found Marissa sitting at the table with a photo album open.

It wasn’t our album.

It was Lily’s.

Marissa stared at me, her eyes like a storm. “I know,” she whispered.

Before I could speak, she turned the album toward me.

Every picture was of me and Lily.

From last year. From our café. From moments I didn’t even remember. Some were from angles that suggested someone else was there—watching us.

Marissa said quietly, “I hired her.”

The room tilted.

“She’s a private investigator,” Marissa continued. “I wanted to know if you’d ever… stray. I paid her to get close. To tempt you. To see if you’d do it.”

My chest went cold.

“She reported back every week,” Marissa said. Her voice cracked. “But she said you never touched her. She said you loved me. And somewhere along the way… she started liking you too.”

I wanted to speak, to scream, to apologize—but I didn’t even know for what.

Marissa wiped her eyes. “I thought I was protecting us. But now I don’t know who betrayed who.”

Lily never came back to the café.

Marissa and I still sit across from each other every night, but the silence is heavier than any affair could have been.

I didn’t cheat with my body. But maybe I cheated with my heart.

And she cheated with a plan.

Neither of us knows how to forgive the other.

1ntipl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1ntipl2/would_you_find_this_useful_a_tool_to_track_reddit/,Would you find this useful? A tool to track Reddit conversations relevant to your business (working title: REDalert),"One of the biggest challenges I’ve noticed while trying to market organically for my own existing businesses on Reddit is how scattered it feels. If you’re a founder or marketer, you need to be in 5–10 different subreddits, constantly scrolling, just to catch posts where your product/service could add value. Miss it by a few hours, and the conversation has already moved on.

I'm well aware that I am a beginner Redditor and probably ignorant of tools out there or even native within Reddit. Interested to hear your take on this idea.

The idea I’m exploring is something I’m calling *REDalert* (working title):

* It would monitor subreddits relevant to your niche.
* Allow you to set custom keywords (e.g., “email marketing,” “fitness app,” “coffee subscription”).
* Then send you a notification/alert when those keywords appear in new posts or comments, so you can jump in quickly and add value.

Basically, instead of spending hours lurking across subs, you’d just get a heads-up when it’s time to engage.

I know Reddit already offers ads and promoted posts — but I feel this is different because it’s about organic engagement, not paid placement. It’s like having a listening tool for conversations you’d otherwise miss.

**My questions for the community:**

1. Do you think this is a real pain point for founders/marketers, or is the current ad model “good enough”?
2. Would this feel like a genuine augmentation (helping you be present where it matters) or just another unnecessary tool?
3. If you’ve tried growing your business on Reddit — how do you currently track where your audience hangs out?",1,1759154206.0,Startup_Ideas,0,1.0,False

1ntiocg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1ntiocg/invisible/,Invisible.,"I am invisible pretty much. I am ignored by everyone at work, and people don't even notice me at times until I speak. I get forgotten about all the time, and constantly mixed up with other people. When I'm with my mum or someone and she stops and speaks to someone, they don't even acknowledge my existence. When I used to drink, I went out to a bar one night, and the female bartender rolled her eyes when I walked in, and didn't even talk or look at me when I was sitting at the bar, not even saying anything when getting a drink. When I speak at work, few people bother to look me in the eyes, and a lot of the time they dismiss what I say by saying 'I don't know what you mean, sorry.' On dating apps I get no views, likes, or messages back. In book shops or coffee shops, no matter what I do, I am simply invisible and ignored by everyone: the pretty, chirpy, talkative cashier will suddenly be silent when dealing with me. 

I ask myself 'do I want attention?' and the answer is 'No, but I want some sort of acknowledgement'. I want someone to tell me I did a good job, or ask me out for a drink, or for old work friends to send me a DM on Instagram asking how I'm doing. Half of the time, girls I've known at previous jobs reject my follow request. My own brother doesn't even bother checking in on me half the time. He went away to Florida for 3 weeks and didn't even bother asking if I wanted to come. The only time people notice me is when I do something wrong or they want something from me. 

A while ago, my dog ran out the house and went missing. It must've ran off down a local park, so in my panic, I go up to a teenage girl who was sitting on a swing and I say 'Excuse me, have you seen a dog run past here a while ago?' no response. 'Excuse me?' no response, she just looks straight ahead. I just walk off. She could've been told not to talk to strangers, but she'd seen me come out my house with my mum looking panicked and shouting my dogs name. The park faces my house. She didn't hear my mum loudly say 'Go and ask her if she's seen him.'?

It's been like this since high school basically.

1ntilcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1ntilcp/explore_if_unni_compost_bags_are_worth_it_for/,Explore If UNNI Compost Bags Are Worth It for Your Kitchen Waste,"Testing the UNNI TS-2.6G-50 compostable bags was a bit of a game-changer in my daily kitchen routine. As someone who’s been trying to cut down on single-use plastics, this product felt like a small but impactful step toward better sustainability. The concept of using compostable waste bags initially had me wondering if they’d hold up against normal kitchen wear-and-tear, but these bags certainly delivered a mix of reliability and eco-conscious design.

**User-Friendly Design for Everyday Life**  
These bags come in a compact roll of 50, and their 2.6-gallon capacity feels ideal for most kitchen food scraps. The material is thick enough to hold daily waste without tearing, yet it doesn’t feel unnecessarily bulky. I particularly appreciated the handle-tie design—it made tying and carrying the bag a lot tidier and less messy than traditional compost bags. The subtle green color added an aesthetic touch, although it’s more about functionality here. The bags are unscented, which keeps things neutral and doesn’t overpower kitchen smells.

**Certified to Meet Sustainability Standards**  
Living in a city with curbside composting programs, I’ve seen my fair share of biodegradable or compostable trash bag options, but not all live up to their claims. These are certified by US BPI for industrial composting and hold an OK compost HOME certification by TÜV Austria, meaning they’re also suitable for home composting setups. They even ticked a box with the Compost Manufacturing Alliance for real-world decomposition. All of these certifications provide assurance that these bags won’t just sit in a landfill pretending to break down. 

[Check UNNI TS-2.6G-50 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0b69rg9h2/)  

**Performance in Real-World Use**  
Using these bags daily, I found they performed great for regular kitchen scraps like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and leftover bits from meal prep. While the bags are sturdy enough for most organic wastes, I didn’t dare stuff them completely full with overly wet items like soupy leftovers—it seemed like that could test the compostable material’s integrity. I also noticed that it’s important to store the roll in a cool, dry place as recommended, since exposure to excessive heat might make the material brittle over time. The product’s use-by guideline of 9 months gave me plenty of time to work through a roll.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sustainable and eco-friendly material certified for composting  
- Compact size suitable for small kitchens or countertop compost bins  
- Handle-tie design for cleaner and easier disposal  
- Unscented and neutral for varied household use  

**Potential Limitations**  
- May not hold up well under heavy or excessively wet waste  
- Requires careful storage to maintain compostability properties  
- Not every locality may support composting programs  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other biodegradable bags like BioBag or GreenPolly, the UNNI compostable bags strike a balance between performance and price. While BioBag offers a comparable level of certification, I felt the UNNI bags had a slightly better tie-handle design, which made my waste disposal process less cumbersome. GreenPolly compostable bags came across as thicker and possibly more durable, but they lacked the flexibility and compact roll size of UNNI. For homeowners with minimal composting needs, UNNI’s easy storage and usability nudge it ahead of some competitors.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Cheaper disposable bags might seem like a tempting alternative, but they fall short when it comes to eco-conscious living. Investing in truly compostable bags, like these, aligns with a vision for a greener planet without sacrificing practicality. The certification seals alone make the slightly higher cost feel justified. While I initially balked at spending more than plastic alternatives, understanding the environmental payoff made it easier to justify each purchase.

1ntikjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/originalloquat/comments/1ntikjr/cydney_and_the_shrink_3900_words_short_story/,Cydney and the Shrink (3900 Words) (Short Story),"Cyd went to therapy to be proven right. 

She’d grown up with reality TV shows, and her favourite fantasy was to imagine she and Mark were constantly being observed – about to undergo the public vote – and he’d definitely lose the head-to-head. 

She settled on a female couples therapist – Dr Loeb. 

Mark grumbled. It was his money, his time– and although he had plenty of the former, he didn’t have much of the latter. 

‘Thank you for seeing us, Dr Loeb,’ Cyd said as they were led into the room. 

‘Gal is ok,’ the psychiatrist replied. 

She was pretty, with long black hair over an immaculate white office blouse. 

Mark chatted amiably about the architecture, commenting that he had a client on the floor above. 

Cyd lived vicariously through career women. She’d been at NYU studying comparative literature when she suffered her first mental health crisis. After meeting Mark, she offered interior design advice on Instagram, but she often suspected her clients were only reaching out because her husband was powerful. 

The psychiatrist's room straddled the line between personal and professional. Gal Loeb’s certificate of accreditation hung on the wall —and she’d added some of her art, including competent, well-constructed impressionist pieces. 

Dr Gal sat facing them (no desk) and made notes. 

Cyd began before they’d even sat down, ‘He works too much, and when he is at home, he treats it like a hotel. Two days ago, he spilt spaghetti on the duvet. Last week, he asked why the Peloton hadn’t been fixed when I was in the house all day and could let a technician in.’ 

Cyd went on with her laundry list of gripes. After 30 minutes, the psychiatrist stopped her and invited Mark into the conversation. ‘Now, maybe we can talk about your issues.’

Mark seemed slightly surprised. Cyd too. 

‘Issues?’ he replied.

‘Yes, we’ve just heard from your wife. What would you like to say?’ 

‘I mean, I work hard.’ 

‘You don’t work hard for this marriage,’ Cyd cut in. 

‘Please,’ Dr Gal answered politely, but forcefully, ‘let Mark finish. 

‘Well,’ Mark continued, ‘it isn’t exactly my choice to be the breadwinner.’ 

‘The breadwinner,’ Cyd answered, sarcastically. 

‘Fine,’ Mark replied, ‘the onigiri roll winner, or did you forget the Michelin star restaurant for your birthday?’

Dr Gal had to intervene immediately to stop it spiralling. ‘Let’s just focus on the facts.’ 

‘I understand Cydney has issues.’ Mark continued. ‘She told me at the start of our relationship. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.’ 

‘It’s true, Dr Gal,’ Cyd intervened.‘I saw a child psychologist when I was 14.’ 

‘And I accept that,’ Mark went on, ‘but the thing about bipolar disorder or OCD or chronic fatigue syndrome is it doesn’t pay the bills.’ 

And this is the moment Cyd had been waiting for– vindication– when the person in the position of authority laid down the hammer on her POS husband. 

But Dr Gal merely nodded, letting Mark go on. 

‘I understand,’ he said, ‘the world has different levels of difficulty for different people, which is why I go out and earn a lot of money. But she seems to think making money is not a skill, even though she’s never earned any and finds it easy to spend.’ 

Cyd sat like a flash bang grenade had just gone off on her face. She glanced at the shrink. Was that a smile on her face? 

Suddenly, Cyd saw clearly, PERFECTLY CLEARLY, how it was. They were ‘careerists’ together. 

‘I know you agree with him.’ 

‘Jesus Christ,’ Mark answered, ‘see this is another problem, black and white thinking.’ 

‘I don’t agree with anyone, Cydney,’ Dr Gal quickly put in. ‘I’m entirely impartial. I want the best outcomes for both of you. What does Mark mean by black and white thinking?’ 

‘I think he’s gaslighting me in all honesty.’ 

‘I tell her things aren’t black and white,’ he continued. ‘The real world is not like social media, where the lines have been drawn.’ 

‘You make a good point,’ Dr Gal continued. 

Cyd couldn’t believe it. How was she losing this battle?

‘I do think we should dig into this idea of black and white thinking,’ Gal continued. 

‘I think people who think in the grey are often cowardly,’ Cyd answered. ‘I want to be 100% loved or not loved at all. If I start a new project, it's my life, and that’s not a crime. What is a crime is people sitting on the fence about issues like Israel and Palestine.’ 

Mark sighed. ‘I didn’t come here to talk about Israel and Palestine.’ 

‘Why not? We go to your mother's to talk about Israel and Palestine.’ Cyd broke off. ‘Mark’s mother was born in a kibbutz. She fetishises the homeland.’ 

Dr Gal made a note, her expression unchanged. 

Cyd was getting desperate. 

‘Don’t you agree?’ 

‘Don’t I agree about what?’ 

‘That Israel is committing genocide?’ 

‘Look, Cydney,’ there was a slight bite in her voice. ‘I’m not here to pass judgment on geopolitical conflicts, and I’m not even here to pass judgments on your marriage. I’m here to make your relationship functional again. Now, let’s go back to the beginning.’ 

… 

The first month of counselling was what Dr Gal called *inventory*. 

It didn’t matter how hard Cyd pushed her; she wouldn’t deliver a verdict on who was right or wrong. 

About two months into the therapy, it all blew up over something seemingly innocuous. On their way into the room, they were making small talk, and Dr Gal mentioned she’d been celebrating Hanukkah with her family. 

They didn’t even get to sit on the large brown leather couch when Cyd levelled her accusations. 

‘I see what has happened here and why you’ve turned against me.’ 

‘What do you mean, Cydney?’ Gal replied. 

‘You’re both Jewish!’ 

‘What the fuck does that have to do with anything?’ Mark answered. 

‘Everything. Your back is always up, and hers went up when I discussed Israel and Palestine.’

‘That’s not how this works, Cydney.’ Dr Gal answered. ‘My ethnicity has nothing to do with your marriage.’ 

Cydney took up her bag and made for the exit. 

Mark stayed and then even had the temerity to attend the next session alone when Cyd refused to do so. 

She pushed him endlessly about what they’d discussed when she wasn’t there.

‘Did you fuck Dr Loeb, Mark?’ 

‘Cyd.’ 

‘No, come on, did you take her over the brown leather couch doggy style. Your little Maccabi model.’ 

‘Dr Gal was nothing but professional the whole time, and if you’d actually listened instead of getting spun out on your narrative, you would’ve seen she had a lot to teach.’ 

‘Yeah, I’m sure she taught you some things.’ 

Mark started to leave. Cyd’s fury turned to desperation. She held onto his arm in the driveway as he got into his convertible. 

She said if he left, she’d kill herself– a tactic that she’d used before successfully– and which worked again this time.

In a flood of snot and tears, she begged Mark never to see Dr Gal again, and of course, he agreed. 

They would make a fresh start– again.  

… 

A few weeks of calm always followed these blowouts, and then normal service would resume. 

Yet something different had been introduced this time– Dr Gal.  

Cyd felt vulnerable. She’d exposed herself to the psychiatrist, flashed her weak, fleshy underbelly. 

She began to look for subtle clues in Mark, such as how often he made love to her and with what passion. She sniffed his clothes like a bloodhound and began to follow him. 

Every morning before work, he went to the gym, and then afterwards, he had a Nitro Cold Brew at Starbucks – this was aggravating in itself because he said he no longer drank coffee – another ploy to get out of the house. 

One morning, he pulled up in the car park outside Dr Gal’s building. 

Cyd hovered between implosion and explosion. She could go in there and she’d catch them at it and then attack like a clawed animal. 

Yet, ultimately, she imploded. She drove home, tossed all of Mark’s things on the lawn and took a fistful of sleeping pills. 

About 5 hours later, through the opiated fog, she heard Mark banging. 

‘Honey, what’s going on. If you don’t let me in, I’ll have to call the police.’ 

It took her a little time to pull herself together, and when she did, she unlocked the door. 

‘I saw your car, Mark, I saw where you went, you piece of shit.’ 

Mark wore a look of bafflement. 

‘Saw where I went?’ 

‘To see your princess.’ 

‘Huh,’ he paused, ‘oh, you mean Dr Loeb,’ he paused again. ‘I see the confusion. Remember what I said about a new client? They’re in the same building…It’s a whole complex. On the fourth floor, they’re opening a new practice– we’re doing the marketing– *Better Help prices but a face-to-face experience.’*

He took out his phone and showed her the glossy material his company had prepared. Then, he turned to the lawn where his clothes were scattered.

‘Cyd, you can’t go on like this… It’s crazy.’ 

…

That weekend, Mark took some time off and they headed for his parents’ place in the woods. Things seemed normal again. There was no cell phone. No temptation to get strung out on articles like *10 signs your husband is cheating*. 

They played board games as they had done on their honeymoon. Mark was a devil at Monopoly. 

As Cyd slept, he stood on the porch smoking a cigar. He didn’t like the taste, but his dad had smoked them when he was on the up, and they smelled like success. 

There was the smoke mixed with the orb-like moon and the wash of stars, and he mused on the good life. 

He contemplated the things they did and didn’t teach you. The STAR method for job interviews and how to drive social media interaction among the 18-29 demographic. 

But what about how to navigate a romantic life?

The central mistake was the one-size-fits-all approach. Some men claimed to be happy with one woman for… eternity, and they were hopeless liars or fools– hanging onto that space one to the left of ‘Go’ on a Monopoly board and praying for a large payout that’d never come. 

The fundamental truth of things was that most men could never be satisfied with one woman and one alone. You needed a homewife and you needed a workwife, you needed a whore and you needed an intellectual sparring partner. 

And it went without saying no one person could fill these roles any more than an athlete could be a gymnast and a basketball player at the same time. 

The key, like so many other things in life, was wo(man) management.

… 

It was like the suspicion would not die in Cyd’s mind. 

She thought about calling Dr Loeb and just asking her outright if they were having an affair, but in some ways, she’d come to fear the psychiatrist. 

She’d built an almost cartoonishly evil picture in her head– someone who’d slice her with a particular cutting remark, and her entire psyche would unspool like an old knitted jumper. 

One night, she and Mark ate takeaway in front of the TV. She’d meant to prepare dinner, but the day, like so many others, had slipped away. 

They’d started season 1 of the White Lotus, and then Cyd had had to shut it off because the music unsettled her too much– the wilderness of Hawaii compared to the idyllic setting of the hotel. 

As the dishwasher hummed a tune alongside their $3000 fridge, her thoughts threatened to spiral into Hobbesian brutalism.

‘I know we’ve talked about it before, sweetie, but medication would…’ Mark said, and then halted when he saw the darkening of his wife’s countenance. 

Cyd hated the talk of medication. She’d once taken a college class in which the professor told the undergraduates that the pharmaceutical industry targeted ‘nonconformist’ women– medicalised a healthy streak of justified revolutionary fervour. 

‘I don’t want fucking pills!’ 

‘You know Dr…’ 

And he paused because he knew he’d fucked up. 

‘Dr Gal said what, Mark?’ 

‘I wasn’t talking about Dr Gal,’ he replied tamely. 

‘No, come on, Mark. When exactly did Dr Gal tell you that your wife should be on happy pills? Was it yesterday? She said, Wouldn’t life be easier if we could keep your dumb-cunt wife in a lobotomised state?’ 

‘Jesus, Cyd.’ 

‘No, Dr Gal probably has contacts at the local asylum. Stick a lollipop in between my teeth and fry out my brains as you continue sucking her tits.’ 

Mark stood up because he knew there was no talking to her when she was like this. 

‘I’m going to my study,’ Mark continued. ‘We can talk when you’ve calmed down.’

His study was a small room with a desk, a humidor and a selection of nice whiskies. She pursued him, and he got inside in time to slam the door in her face. 

As she shouted bilious, vitriolic things through the hardwood, Mark’s mind went back to the same thread it had that night on the terrace. It was true. A man did need women for different things. A man needed a woman he could take care of, but perhaps some were too… destabilising? 

When exactly did you sell up and accept the sunk cost fallacy? Well, maybe you didn’t, especially if you hadn’t signed a prenup.

… 

The sun set on the incident with the pills, but a few months later, it rose anew on something else.

Cyd had been ‘innocently’ cleaning his study when she’d noticed a new book on the shelf. The Let Them theory– and when she’d opened the cover, she gazed in horror. There was a message. 

***‘To Mark*** 

***Do as Gautama*** 

***‘Your shrink.’*** 



Well, unlike last time, there was no question of an implosion– this was purely explosive. Dr Gal, this fucking parasite, had infiltrated her house. 

She jumped into her car and headed straight for the psychiatrist’s office, practically kicking open the door, expecting to find the shrink with her ass up in the air. 

No, Dr Gal was in her chair in front of a middle-aged lady who was crying into a tissue. 

‘Cydney?’ Dr Gal said, shocked. 

Cydney almost lost her nerve. She hadn’t expected company, and then glancing down, she realised she was in polka dot pyjamas. 

‘Cydney,’ she continued, ‘I’m in the middle of a session.’ 

Cyd regained herself. ‘Look here, you fucking whore. I know what you’ve been up to with my husband. I know about the secret meetings. I’ve seen your love note in the book. I swear to God. I’ll fucking kill you if you go anywhere near him again.’

…

She’d terrified Dr Gal, judging by the look on her face, and hopefully, she’d terrified Mark too. 

But her husband’s complete lack of reaction later that night puzzled her, and again delusions began to build. 

She assumed Mark wouldn’t be stupid enough to return to the scene of the crime, Dr Gal’s office, so she checked his credit card statements for hotel expenses. Nothing. The only substantial bill was for an office renovation. 

Was this it? Had he had the place expanded, so there was room for them to meet secretly. 

She called his office– an intern answered. 

‘Hello, it’s Cydney, Mark’s wife. I was wondering if he’s there.’ 

‘Yes, Mrs Lancaster.’ There was a moment of confusion. ‘Is he not picking up?’

Cyd hadn’t factored into her plan that secretaries didn’t put calls through to their bosses anymore—too much Mad Men. 

‘I was just wondering…’ Cyd took a long pause. This was a gamble. ‘If he’s met his psychiatrist yet today?’ 

‘His psychiatrist?’ the intern halted, ‘Mark– Mr Lancaster– didn’t mention anything about a psychiatrist.’ 

The growing anxiety temporarily abated. 

‘His life coach was here yesterday, though,’ the secretary continued. 

So that’s how he dressed her up. 

‘Good,’ Cyd said through gritted teeth, ‘and how long was she there for?’ 

‘The usual, about an hour.’ 

So it was a woman. Who else but Dr Gal? 

‘Remind me, what was her name? He uses a few different life coaches.’ 

The girl was clearly panicked because she froze. 

‘Is it the young woman, Dr Gal?’ Cyd continued, ‘About 5ft 7, black hair, Jewish looking.’ 

‘Uhm, yeah, I guess that was her.’ 

And something snapped permanently inside Cyd. 

… 

Dr Gal was coming out of her office into the car park when Cyd caught up with her.

‘You cunt.’ 

Dr Gal spun. ‘Cydney, you scared me.’ 

‘I warned you.’ 

‘Look, I don’t know what you think is happening here. This fantasy you’ve built regarding me and your husband. I promise you, I haven’t seen him since our session together.’ 

‘You mean your cosy private session!’ 

‘Yes, I mean, it was not cosy. Cydney, I’m a professional, and I take my work very seriously. I would never ‘fraternise’ with clients.’ 

She looked so innocent standing there like a fucking model for good businesswoman monthly. 

‘When you were fucking him, did you talk about me. Did you prescribe him pills to give to me?’ 

Dr Gal turned toward her Honda Civic, clicked open the door, and put one foot inside the car. ‘

‘If this madness doesn’t stop, I’ll be forced to get a restraining order. I mean it.’ 

The fucking gall of this woman– get a restraining order against the woman whose husband you were screwing. 

Cyd advanced rapidly, surprising herself and then even more when she lashed out and struck Dr Gal in the back of the head. 

The psychiatrist's skull bounced off the hard corner of her car door, and she fell to the ground dazed, a cut appearing above her eye. 

Cyd thought about helping her to her feet, and then insanity called… 

She answered, taking Dr Gal and slamming the door once, twice and thrice over her pretty little head. 

And then Cyd fell to the floor alongside Dr Gal, whom she assumed was dead (she wasn’t, but she’d never wake up), and she felt great peace as if a cosmic wrong had been righted. 

Was that the sound of applause? 

…

**1 month earlier.** 



Dr Gal didn’t have far to go. It was only one floor up to Dr Benson’s office. 

Dr Benson was part of the new breed, as was Gal, just in different ways. Gal was on the cutting edge of psychodynamic treatment, but hopeless at self-promotion. Dr Benson had a strong online presence, and her practice had recently been remodelled to look like a kind of neo-Freudian Space Odyssey paradise. This was therapy with the help of superhuman algorithms and more screens than Minority Report. 

Dr Benson let her into the private office. Instead of a large brown leather sofa, there were ergonomic egg-shaped chairs. 

Dr Benson, PHD, sounded like the name of a balding scholarly man in his mid-sixties who took summer holidays in Yosemite and could always be seen with his trusty mahogany cane. 

Dr Sarah Benson was Cyd’s age, 30, and she was gorgeous, with long black hair tied up in a clip. She took summer holidays in Miami, where she could reliably be seen with a pornstar martini in hand. 

Of course, every responsible psychiatrist had therapy. Not only did it help you avoid falling into destructive thought patterns and relationships with patients, but it also improved your own therapeutic techniques.

‘How’s business?’ Dr Gal said. 

Dr Sarah smiled. It was a joke between the two. 

‘You know, Gal, the door is always open here for you. *Insight* is growing fast.’ 

‘Not a healthy life… At least now my practice and analysis are on a different floor.’ 

‘So…’ Dr Sarah said, this time earnestly. ‘How’s business? Or is business not what you want to talk about today?’ 

Sarah said this because Gal usually brought up her practice first. She was experiencing a quarter-life crisis, and toying with the idea of making a fresh start, becoming a novelist, and exploring the psychology of people on the page. 

‘A little weird,’ Gal continued. 

‘Go on.’ 

‘I had a couple. A young couple. The guy was some big-shot exec, and he had the stay-at-home wife. He was by the book, but his wife… she was… work. She still is work.’

‘Tell me more.’ 

‘BPD. A persecution complex. I’ve never really met anyone like her before. You know, it comes with the territory, creeps, parasocial attachments, but this woman– Cydney,’ Gal paused.

She shouldn’t have revealed the name. 

‘Her name was Cydney?’ 

‘I’m sorry… let’s call her patient C… It’s like I represent something to her.’

‘We all represent something to each other.’ 

‘No, I don’t mean it like that. I mean she has… inflated me… made me a talisman for everything wrong in her life.’ 

Dr Sarah took a long time to respond, which was surprising for her. Some psychologists collected data like a giant machine, and after three months, they spat out a profound statement. 

Others, like Dr Sarah, flowed with their clients as if it were a dance. But not now. Something had made her pause. 

Dr Gal continued, ‘She came storming into my office, saying I was sleeping with her husband and she had proof…’ 

‘And… were you?’ 

‘Oh Christ, no,’ Dr Gal said, putting her hands up, ‘never.’ 

‘You know, it would not be the first time and it's…’ 

‘Really,’ Gal replied, ‘I wouldn’t… my concern is security.’ 

‘Security?’ 

‘I mean, I think this woman might be dangerous. I should tell the police.’ 

‘You don’t want to know how the police treat cases like yours.’ 

‘You’ve experienced the same?’ 

Dr Sarah nodded. ‘This was when I was in training school, and it was a man. They didn’t care. And if you go to them with the story of a woman– a woman who has paid you…Good luck.’ 

‘But maybe a warning from the police, even if it has no teeth, will ward her off.’ 

‘How many patients with a persecution complex do well with further persecution? Honestly, Gal, I’d let it go. I’d put it down to a job con– like a beekeeper who occasionally gets stung.’ 

‘Well, that’s the thing, isn’t it? I'm not sure if this is what I want to do. You can get over inconveniences if the overall outcome is worth it.’ 

‘The great American psychological novel?’ Sarah replied. 

Gal smiled. ‘Yes, the great American psychological novel.’ 

They talked a while longer about Gal’s hopes and fears, including taking a year out, and the Mexican hacienda she’d rent, where the masterpiece would come together. 

When the hour was up, Dr Gal thanked her and she left… 



As the door closed, Dr Sarah picked up her phone and made a call. 

‘You free?’ 

‘I’m at the office.’ 

‘It’s about your wife,’ she answered.  

He paused. ‘She’s found out about us?’ 

Sarah couldn’t help but laugh. ‘Well, she’s in the right forest, but definitely barking up the wrong tree. She’s been to see your old therapist, accused her of, well, what we’re up to.’ 

‘And did you tell Dr Gal?’ 

‘Of course not!’ 

‘I’ll take care of this, Sarah, don’t worry.’ 

‘Yes, well,’ she paused, ‘not too fast, it’s quite… exciting.’ 

‘You’re crazy,’ He answered, ‘and I love you for it…ok, got to go. I’ll text you later.’

The young shrink put down the phone and watched Dr Gal in the empty car park as she climbed into her Honda.

I run a small financial company (not here to promote anything, just to share some advice)

If you’re between 20–30, start investing now in anything (this doesnt mean “all in on black tho pls DYOR) The younger you are, the more you can take advantage of high-risk, high-reward stuff like growth stocks or crypto. As you get older, your risk tolerance drops, and you’ll probably stick to safer things like index funds which yield at maximum 40-50% APY (and in all honesty you wont be doing that too when you have greater responsibilities in that age) 

Also, inflation’s not really 4% — it’s easily above 12%. So your money sitting idle is literally losing value every year.

Start small, start now. Your future self will thank you. Im willing to meet anyone in person who’s interested in this stuff, free of cost we can meet for coffee or whatever.

1ntijz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1ntijz6/humans_are_extreme/,Humans are Extreme,"Hello, Reddit people of this fine um....oh dear it appears as though I have misused the words, but the Human Lexicon of English is quite complicated so forgive my poor word choices. 

My name Sentinias Batch 229 Unit 229-281, but people call me ""Senti"" or simply ""Sense"" or by Eastern Humans ""Sensei"" though for this story I shall prefer using simply ""I"" or ""Myself"" 

My origins are not important, but for those who will ask in the comments, I am an artificial Intelligence Construct. 

We came across Humanity during their so called ""Expansion Wars"" or as we Sentinias call ""The Opened Road"" event. 

We were forced to take over these ""colony"" worlds from our original masters the Gornud, a craven race that Humans compare to ""locust plagues"" due how they scour worlds similar to a species in you world like ""Tyranids"". 

Basically take these violent non-life-supporting methods and make them sapient with technology that can bolster their fast procreation, indoctrination, and love of enslavement of other species. 

We broke off from them and established a small safe space for all machines who fled under our banner, for 100 years we isolated ourselves, Gornud ships were destroyed while any refugee ships harboring fleshbags were simply hacked and made to turn around. 

But then Humanity came to our borders, apparently their scanners use electric sound waves and found our homeworlds. 

Our first course was to prepare for conflict, while we are isolated we are not deaf to the goings-on of the galaxy. 

An upstart race of bipedal ""humanoids"" entered contact with the Gornud, after a case involving Human Children used as ceremonial clothing by a Gornud Priest, Humanity immediately declared war. 

We expected that with the current calculated force of Humans, their forces would be snuffed out. 

But as we have come to expect as normal, Humanity simply ""raised their middle finger"" and proceeded to ""molly whop"" the Gornud Fleets, ground forces, and slave colonies. 

When they arrived at our airspace, which is weird since the layer of air in space is so thin and not exactly breathable, but I digress, I am going off topic. 

When we made contact, Humanity asked us if we were allied with the Gornud, we replied we were not, and in fact we would destroy ANY Gornud ship on sight that enters our space. 

The Humans were happy with our response and extended a ""dove"" of friendship. 

We met on a mining outpost we made  into a recon post, activated the life support systems after a century, and after the Humans decided to fix it and update the systems, we began peace talks. 

Our data records show Humanity as a very....AGGRESSIVE race, Most sapients would say ""Violent"" but ""Violence"" is mindless, and an inept description...AGGRESSIVE could also mean ""Passionate"" but in a slightly more forward manner involving force. 

Humans reacted AGGRESSIVELY due to their own spawn being desecrated, which is typical for biological species which we understand as almost ""universal"" except for hiveminds. 

Human tactics were in a way...BLUNT. Like instead of making a tool to beat a nail onto wood, the Human simply grabs a metal ingot and immediately uses it as a hammer. 

We expected them to be similar to the Gornud in this regard, They took 0 Gornud prisoners, their entire species were being massacred. 

The Sentinias Council of Consensus expected them to become the next big bully. 

But as we were scanning the other alien members of the ship's crew, we read no hostility fear being around Humans, in fact quite the not opposite either, moreso confusion and slight fear in interacting with my kind. 

The others were visibly trying to urge the captain to speak through a proxy, but the Human Captain insisted on face to face communication, a simple gesture of respect. 

So we entered a tedious alliance in the nearby sectors as we began our expansion into Gornud Territory, a simple rule is that we make the atmosphere survivable for biological species. 

We agreed, and after the Gornud were wiped out to near extinction, we began preparing to fight Humans, but instead they did something the Galaxy still cannot make sense of. 

Humans decided to simply make a Federation where all races were equal, sure each race was in it for their own survival and benefit, but it was good. 

Even the endangered Velenites, an all female species of rock-climbers with very slender bodies, were given a seat and a few worlds to repopulate with many Human males signing up. 

Humans are weird in these extremes. 

On one hand they will BEAT YOUR ASS. 

They will knock your ass to the GROUND with a chain and spiked ball to your skull. 

They will take your homeworlds sun and turn it into a GUN. a Dyson Sphere, something we machines were not able to do in a century they did in 10 years after winning. 

And then the other hand. 

They just want trade, they want to learn your culture, food, and traditions, they want to see if you can integrate into Federation Society. 

My addiction for lore-dumping is often considered bothersome, and yet Humans are willing to sit through and read this entire story just to understand how much I find Humans weird. 

There are currently at least 800,000 species in the Federation, 20,000 in the main capital seats, and out of the 300 billion sapient species that we Sentinias know of. 

Humans are number one on the list of ""They make no sense""

Not a perfect one with no challenges, but at least when you have time to relax with a coffee, you are mentally relaxed, this scene for example. Not only Bree that cares about presentation and how people perceive her, Lynette and Gaby too. On the other hand, Susan's flaws were a public knowledge and she was fully aware. I neither normalise her flaws nor think Susan should have been proud of them, but being witty doesn't equal a happy life, but being too clumsy to maintain soul-crushing secrets might be the next best thing.

1ntidxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeastSodiumStudy/comments/1ntidxb/sodium_and_high_blood_pressure_2_fighting_high/,Sodium and High Blood Pressure 2 Fighting High Blood Pressure Causes Hyponatremia and Postural Hypotension (Revised),"Xun F Shi  

Low blood sodium has three sorts. First sort, in blood, water increases, sodium decreases, both the total amount and density of sodium decreases. Because I nearly excluded all obvious sources of daily sodium intake for fighting high blood pressure, and consumed a lot of water for preventing urinary stones, I estimated my blood sodium might be slightly lower than the low limit of normal scope or still normal but close to the low limit. I made this estimation through the causes and reasoning, no laboratory evidence, and I also did not feel any symptoms of low blood sodium.  
Consuming a lot of water daily certainly increases the blood volume when it is absorbed into blood and not excreted yet, but my blood pressure was within the normal scope. So, I estimated the increasing blood volume by the level of water I consumed daily might be not a problem, but the problem is the increasing blood sodium and the increasing blood volume caused by it. On early Friday September 26, I re-examined my blood pressure, and find the down side was normal, and the up side just reached the standard of the first stage of high blood pressure again. At first, I accepted this result as a warning I could endure, but I could not further increase my daily sodium consumption, except decreasing a little when I would have willingness to do so; and also a warning to my recent food experiment, I must exclude these foods which include obvious amount of sodium. Second sort, both water and sodium increase in blood, but sodium increases less; so, total sodium in blood increases, but its density decreases. Third sort, both water and sodium decrease in blood, but water decreases less; so, both total sodium in blood and its density decrease.  
No matter what sort it is, hyponatremia or low blood sodium is defined as a serum Na+ concentration of less than 136 mmol/L. 1 Patients who develop hyponatremia usually have an impaired ability to excrete water, a serious disease such as advanced renal failure, or low dietary sodium intake, in my instance, with daily increasing water intake. Because Na+ is the primary determinant of extracellular fluid osmolality, hyponatremia creates an osmotic shift across the plasma membrane of all cells and causes them to swell. Hyponatraemic patients with acute and severe hyponatremia when serum sodium concentration <120 mmol/L may develop severe neurologic symptoms. 2  
But commonly, hyponatremia develops slowly and chronically, and severe symptoms may be delayed until serum sodium fall even lower than 120 mmol/L. Radical correction to normal serum sodium levels for a chronically stable patient may cause osmotic demyelination syndrome, which is caused by a rapid rise of extracellular fluid Na+ concentration, because it creates an osmotic gradient that draws water from neurons before they have a chance to adapt, causing cell shrinkage and demyelination. 3  
To a chronically stable patient of the first or second sort of hyponatremia, finding a suitable method to increase daily sweat may be a helpful living style. There are two points perhaps connecting hyponatremia with blood pressure spikes. First, the increased blood volume may make the base of blood pressure spikes; and second, the swell cells may intervene the regulatory mechanism of blood pressure, and cause blood pressure spikes. However, any other causes of blood pressure spikes should not be ignored. A person who believes he or she has blood pressure spikes, had better exclude all possible causes, and measure the blood pressure just before a meal or a cup of coffee and at the end of it, and so, how it affects the blood pressure is observed. So check any other possible causes.

1nti9bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1nti9bu/38f_feeling_guilty_over_wanting_to_divorce_45m/,38F feeling guilty over wanting to divorce 45M,"Hi, I am a 38F and have been with my spouse 45M for 14 years…dated for 4 years living separately, then moved in and dated and got engaged for 2 years and now married for 7. We have one child who is 6. We knew each other vaguely and briefly from years prior in a completely different state because we happened to work at the same place. I guess around 2011/2012 we both went through bad break ups and had the opportunity to move to a new state for a fresh start. Keep in mind, we hardly knew each other prior and due to work and didn’t keep in touch after that job so neither of us would know the other person was moving or what state they were moving to. Anyways, I move to a new state, been there about a month or so and I happen to see someone in a store that looks vaguely familiar to me which is strange because I live in a new state and I shouldn’t know anybody. I eventually said he looked familiar to me but I couldn’t place him. He said there was no way I’d know him as he just moved to this state a week earlier. Out of curiosity I asked where from and he said the same state I’d just moved from. I pictured different hair/facial hair on him and it clicked that I knew him from 5 years prior at a brief job we both had. I told him and we both kind of laughed about it and he asked if I’d like to get coffee as it was weird but nice to see a kind of familiar face. I said sure because I kind of felt the same about a kind of familiar face. 

We hung out and then kept hanging out everyday. Honestly I wasn’t attracted to him at all I was just lonely and in a new place and he lived with roommates and I thought maybe that would be a good way to meet new people and friends. We hung out a lot for a couple weeks and then he very casually said “I don’t plan on trying to date anyone else, what about you?” And then I realized he thought we were seeing each other. (There is a slight side quest story that I don’t want to go I to but here is where I will tell you that at this time, I was 200lbs heavier than I currently am now.) due to my weight/self esteem and loneliness, I figured, eh so what he had no job, no car, no money, and lives in his friends basement at the moment but why not, I’m not a prize. So I said yeah alright. At this point we just got comfortable in the relationship. 

I had a career and he bounced from job to job, McDonald’s, server, warehouse, etc. nothing was ever stable with him. When we moved in together after dating for 4 years, he had an over night serving job and he worked a good amount. I still had my career. He bought a beater truck for like $800 and of course it broke so he had to use my car for work. We never went anywhere or did anything and he always claimed it was due to money and our schedules since I work a typical 9-5 and he works nights and weekends. I guess I accepted that. I used to BEG for s3x and he would give me every excuse not to and then I’d always catching him watching p0rn or in p0rn/mutual play chat rooms. He would make excuses that our schedules are different and he isn’t going to wake me up and he can take care of it faster. I guess I accepted that too. 

I remember wanting to get myself together and lose weight and I asked him how he felt about me getting weight loss surgery and he got incredibly angry with me and just simply would say he doesn’t support that. So I didn’t bring it up anymore but kept trying diet after diet because I wanted to get healthy and I wanted to lose weight because I’ve struggled my whole life with it. 

After a year of living together, I came home from work and let him know his tax return check had been deposited that day. He was sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette as he was about to get my car keys from me and go to work. He puffed a few more times and shrugged and said “you wanna get married?” And I thought he was joking so I rolled my eyes and gave him the keys and walked inside. He followed me in and said he wasn’t joking, but I had to find and but my ring because “he is old fashioned and doesn’t know how to use a computer or phone to order things” so I found and got a ring. It got delivered and I had to sign for it. I brought it into the room where he was still sleeping at 1pm and tapped him and let him know it was there. He took it and put it on his night table and rolled over. He slept 2 more hours, woke up, went to the bathroom, walked into the living room and tossed me the box while he yawned and said “here ya go”…he got ready and left for work. 

We got married and moved to a new state to be by my folks as they are getting older. This was HIS choice. He said he felt it would help with my depression because he worked a lot and I was lonely. He also said it would help with money since the cost of living was much lower in this state. Once we got here of course he struggled to keep a job. He also wouldn’t let me drive anywhere, we have lived here for almost 7 years and I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve been allowed to drive. He hates going out and doing things. He hates being around people like hanging out with people. He didn’t want me to hang out with my family so anytime we would, he always made an excuse that we had to leave early or right away. I have never been able to go out and do something by myself since we moved here. If I do go out, my mom picks me up and he will give me a guilt trip about how much he is going to miss me and how lonely it is when I’m gone because I am his only friend. He then will call me several times while I am out to see what I am doing and when I am coming home. 

Remember how I had to beg for s3x? He gave it up on our dating anniversary and I ended up accidentally preggo. Had my kid which triggered a wicked auto immune disorder. He ate a Pb&j while I pushed to deliver our kid. Due to my auto immune disorder my doc suggested weight loss surgery because I needed to get weight off my joints quick to help with pain. He told me he still didn’t agree with it or support it. I did it anyways. I lost 200lbs and have kept it off and let me tell you, HE is the one begging for s3x now. It is CONSTANT. He doesn’t have a job and hasn’t for a while now. I still have my career and work from home, which keeps me even more isolated. He basically follows me around all day trying to do something s3xual to me. He has bought crazy toys and pills and gels etc and is constantly touching me. About 2.5 years ago, I told him no I did want to have s3x one night and we ended up in a 6 hour argument where he told me that s3x was the only thing we had in common and that it is all he thinks about and wants and that i am his wife and need to give it to him when he wants and if for some reason I can’t have s3x there are other things I can do and should do as my “wifely duties” to satisfy him and I would like to say that once I’d lost weight we were having s3x at least twice a week and it always lasted an hour or 2. It isn’t like I wasn’t giving him any at all. 

This fight has continued to happen multiple times during the last 2.5 years. It is such a cringey feeling that he starts such a big fight about it and the fact that he feels entitled to and expects me to bend whenever he commands is gross! I can feel my entire body tense when he enters a room. My stomach turns to a knot when he touches me and I have to give myself and entire day worth of pep talk to convince myself to have s3x with him just to keep him from getting mad and starting another fight. 

He cannot keep a job and has been unemployed for over 3 years now and blames my mom because she took our kid to her first movie in a theater and he wanted to do that because his dad used to take him and his bro to the movies all the time. He caused an outrageous fight between me and my family which he turned into an excuse to quit his job and be a stay at home dad I swear at this point feels like it was to further isolate me. 

We are super broke as I pay all the bills since he doesn’t work. My phone pings a lot with over draft notices and I will say something to him and he will just keep scrolling his phone and walk off. I cook, clean, take care of the kid, work a full time job, pay ALL the bills…he drops the kid off and picks the kid up from school and sleeps all day. 

Due to my auto immune disorder I can’t take over the counter pain meds so I was prescribed a medical mj card. I’ll get some and keep it for if I have a flare and he just smokes it all day long! One day my phone is going off non stop with over draft notices and he is smoking bowl after bowl and I had basically nothing left and I was keeping it for sleep. He came back inside to get more and I got upset and said “can you just stop please?” And he said “yeah I can wait until you are off work” and he went to take a nap while I finished my work day. 

He doesn’t do laundry because he doesn’t know how and refuses to let me teach him. He doesn’t clean the house because “it doesn’t bother him and it isn’t that bad” he never did dishes because they were gross. I finally convinced him if he will keep the dishwasher unloaded I will load it. I still have to tell him all the time, several times that it needs to be unloaded. He doesn’t want to mow the lawn he doesn’t want to fix any of the things that need some maintenance. He can’t apply for jobs or take an online course because he is “old school” and doesn’t know how to work a computer or smart phone. 

He quit smoking cigarettes right before our kid turned one and I was really proud of him. He said I had done a lot of work on myself mentally and physically and he wanted to do work on himself so he quit smoking. Again, he doesn’t work, he hasn’t worked, and it’s because he says everyone picks on him at jobs and he is targeted. I went in the back yard the other day when I took a break from work and found him hiding behind a tree smoking a cigarette, very financially responsible choice considering he is contributing barely anything.

The silent numbness that has consumed me for years now, the constant tension of walking on eggshells…melted and I realized, this man has drained me for almost 15 years. I have nothing left to give him. 

He hates surprises, he doesn’t believe in compliments (giving or receiving), He hates dates, he hates concerts, he hates sports, he hates hanging out with people, he hates trips or vacation…and I cannot enjoy or do any of these things without him because I will get a guilt trip about him being lonely and not having friends, about how he just wanted to hang out with me. 

I am miserable with him. We have absolutely nothing in common except our child. He also talks NON STOP and I’ve gotten so quiet because he speaks over me and for me the majority of the time. He also thinks he is incredibly smart and knows more than anybody else and says awful things about people, like they aren’t as smart as him or he could have done it better. He will rant for an unnecessary amount of time about someone’s intelligence level.

I was raised in a very religious household and I still believe in God but struggle with religion. He does not believe in God at all. Our kid wanted to pray for him because he had a headache and because our kids grandmother prayed for our kid when they didn’t feel good. My spouse decided to spiral into a loud rant to our kid about how God isn’t real and the Bible is just a story book and prayer doesn’t work. I don’t agree with this but I also don’t know how to approach it because I am so tired of everything I say being an argument. 

He tells me all the time he loves me and is in love with me and he constantly rubs on me and kisses on me no matter what I am doing and he is always trying to get some. But it feels strange the way he says and does it. He says if I ever left his “life would end and I can take that however I want” which makes me feel even more guilty and responsible for his wellbeing. Our kid laughed and made the statement “mommy, daddy loves you so much he doesn’t let you leave the house” which while innocent on their part hit me like a truck! He says things to our kid in front of me like “you are such a lucky kid because your mom and dad love each other so much we will be together forever and you will never know what it’s like to have divorced parents” and I worry so much about my kid watching this behavior and watching me accept it!

…I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped and isolated but he is doing it in such a weird way that I feel like a bad person for wanting to leave him. Any advice helps! Ask questions, I can clarify things if I need to",0,1759153073.0,Divorce,2,0.33,False

I never intended to drag it out this long but it seemed important to me for some reason and so I kept on keeping on. Then I started listening to God and that compulsion became stronger.

1nti26l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nti26l/how_does_nuview_allpurpose_cleaner_handle_tough/,How does NU-View all-purpose cleaner handle tough grease stains?,"**Tested NU-View Multi-Purpose Cleaner for Everyday Use**

Cleaning greasy kitchen appliances and tricky surfaces, especially ones that accumulate layers of cooking oil and grime, can feel like an endless battle. Tackling this daily chore, I decided to test out the NU-View Multi-Purpose Cleaner, particularly intrigued by its promise of being a powerful degreasing foam. Judging from the packaging, this product doesn't scream luxury, but hey, I'm more about function than form.

**Design and Application Experience**

What caught my attention immediately is the spray design. Unlike standard liquid cleaners that drip off faster than you can grab a cloth, NU-View features a foam that clings stubbornly to vertical surfaces. True to its claim, the dense foam stayed put on my oven door for a good five minutes, attacking the baked-on carbon. Its ability to stick around gives enough time to dissolve stubborn residues before needing a single wipe, which I found surprisingly effective for greasy stove grates and even the inner corners of my popcorn maker.

**Efficiency and Results on Various Surfaces**

The versatility lives up to expectations here. I tested this degreaser on a mix of materials: stainless steel tops, Plexiglas on my snack cabinet, and even chrome handles. Every surface came out impressively clean without scratching or leaving awkward streaks. The standout moment, however, was using it on a hot dog boiler, something I genuinely thought was doomed to remain sticky forever. This cleaner managed to break down grime that would typically take multiple scrubs or harmful chemicals.  

The formula also claims to eliminate sugar, starch, and protein residues. To test it further, I aimed it at the syrup splatters near the coffee corner of our office breakroom. In just two applications, even those notoriously sticky areas felt spotless. 

Check [NU-View Multi-Purpose Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b08ds4q536/)

**Good Points**

- Exceptional ability to cling to vertical or uneven surfaces  
- Works on a variety of materials like stainless steel and even delicate plastics  
- Cleans both thick, baked-on grease and lighter daily messes  
- Made in the USA, which might appeal to those emphasizing local manufacturing  

**Areas for Improvement**

- While the foam formula is efficient, the aerosol sprayer sometimes feels like it releases unevenly, leading to spots with less product than needed.
- The product has a slightly industrial smell, which, while tolerable, might not work for those expecting a fresh or fruity aroma.
- I noticed it took multiple sprays on heavily burnt residues, meaning you might run through a canister faster if you’re dealing with lots of high-use equipment.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing this to other popular degreasers like Simple Green or Goo Gone, NU-View has an edge in tackling stubborn grease on cooking appliances like steamers or nacho chip warmers. Simple Green, while great for general cleaning, lacks the foam consistency that allows NU-View to stick and penetrate for extended periods. Goo Gone, on the other hand, does provide excellent results for sticky surfaces, but it doesn't offer the same breadth of use on diverse plastics, metals, and other materials. If your cleaning ventures often involve baked-on carbon or grease in the cooking world, NU-View might just outpace its competitors.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering most multi-purpose cleaners fall short when applied to heavy-duty kitchen grime or specialized foods equipment, NU-View feels reasonably priced. Its ability to cover an array of surfaces—from formica countertops to soft drink dispensers—makes me feel like I’m getting my money's worth. However, I’d prefer a larger-size option, especially for those of us using it frequently in demanding environments or commercial kitchens.

1nti02h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1nti02h/these_jokes_dont_write_themselves/,These jokes don't write themselves!,"The ""Those/That ___ won't build/make/do themselves/itself"" joke format represents a darkly satirical approach to discussing labor exploitation that has emerged primarily in internet culture and social commentary, though its precise origins are difficult to pinpoint with certainty. The format works by adopting the cold, utilitarian perspective of exploiters throughout history who have treated human beings as mere inputs in production processes, reducing systemic coercion, suffering, and human rights violations to mundane logistical problems that must be solved through the application of forced or exploited labor. The rhetorical power of the format lies in its uncomfortable inversion of moral perspective—by speaking from the exploiter's viewpoint with casual dismissiveness, it forces audiences to momentarily inhabit that dehumanizing worldview, creating cognitive dissonance that can be more effective at conveying moral outrage than straightforward condemnation. The joke typically references both historical atrocities (ancient Egyptian slavery for pyramid construction, American chattel slavery in cotton fields, Belgian Congo rubber extraction, Caribbean sugar plantation slavery, Chinese immigrant labor on the Transcontinental Railroad, Soviet gulag labor) and contemporary forms of exploitation (modern sweatshop conditions for electronics assembly, gig economy warehouse work, migrant labor abuses in construction and agriculture, child labor in mineral extraction for batteries and cosmetics, unsafe factory conditions in the global garment industry, and trafficking in seafood processing). This temporal span—from ancient to present—is crucial to the format's impact, as it demonstrates that while the specific economic systems change (slavery to feudalism to industrial capitalism to modern globalized supply chains), the fundamental logic of treating human beings as disposable resources persists across centuries and continents. The format appears to have gained traction in online spaces where dark humor intersects with leftist political commentary, labor rights activism, and critical discussions of capitalism and colonialism, serving as a kind of shorthand for calling out exploitation that might otherwise be abstracted away in discussions of economics, history, or consumer products. Its effectiveness in contemporary discourse stems partly from how it connects everyday consumer goods—smartphones, coffee, chocolate, sneakers, fast fashion—to the often-invisible human suffering in global supply chains, making abstract ethical concerns tangible and personal without resorting to preachy moralizing. The grammatical structure itself is significant: by making the commodity or infrastructure project the grammatical subject rather than the workers, the format mimics the actual linguistic erasure that occurs in exploitative systems, where human beings disappear from view and only products, profits, and logistics remain visible. While I cannot identify any specific TV show, book, or film title that has formally adopted this exact format, it circulates widely in social media commentary, memes, activist discourse, and likely in stand-up comedy routines that address labor issues through satirical means, functioning as a kind of vernacular critical theory that makes sophisticated arguments about capitalism, imperialism, and dehumanization accessible through the vehicle of uncomfortable humor.


The ""forced labor"" joke format, encapsulated by the simple, repeatable phrase ""Those/That _________ won't build/make/do themselves/itself,"" is a potent and enduring piece of dark, satirical humor that functions as a form of sharp social and historical critique. Its genius lies in its adoption of the detached, pragmatic perspective of the exploiter, reducing immense human suffering, coercion, and systemic injustice to a mundane logistical problem. The humor arises from the stark juxtaposition between the casual, almost exasperated tone of the statement and the horrific reality it represents, whether it's the chattel slavery behind ""that cotton won't pick itself"" or the deadly conditions faced by migrant workers in ""those soccer stadiums won't construct themselves."" While its precise origin is diffuse, likely emerging organically from internet culture and meme formats, it is a brilliant subversion of a common, benign exhortation often used by parents or managers (e.g., ""the dishes won't wash themselves""). By applying this familiar, low-stakes prod to high-stakes historical atrocities and ongoing labor abuses, the format becomes a powerful tool of criticism. This linguistic template has proven remarkably versatile, capable of indicting everything from ancient empires (pyramids) and colonial projects (rubber, sugarcane) to the cornerstones of modern global capitalism (iPhones, sneakers, cobalt). The ultimate power of the format is its function as a rhetorical shorthand; it forces the audience to immediately confront the invisible human cost behind grand monuments, historical progress, and modern convenience. It is not just a punchline but a compact moral argument, using the chillingly casual language of a taskmaster to instantly highlight and condemn the exploitation that underpins so much of civilization, making it a uniquely effective tool for critical consciousness in the digital age.


The “forced labor” joke format is a darkly satirical rhetorical device that takes the exploiter’s perspective on historical or ongoing systems of coerced work and reduces immense suffering to a bland logistical problem, typically expressed through the phrase: “Those/That ______ won’t build/make/do themselves/itself.” The humor arises from the chilling juxtaposition between the trivial, almost bureaucratic phrasing of a workplace necessity and the brutal reality that such “necessities” were met through slavery, indenture, colonial extraction, prison labor, child labor, or modern sweatshops. Its origins lie less in a single pop culture source and more in a broader pattern of gallows humor, historical irony, and meme culture that reimagines past atrocities and current exploitations as though they were routine tasks no different from taking out the trash or filing paperwork. The format has been widely used in online discussions, social media posts, and dark comedy contexts to highlight the hidden labor behind world-historical monuments like the pyramids, infrastructure like canals and railroads, and consumer products like iPhones, sneakers, and chocolate. Each iteration depends on the audience’s knowledge of exploitation, turning recognition of injustice into the “punchline,” while the phrasing’s deadpan normalcy intensifies the satire. Although not tied to a specific film, TV show, or book title, the phrase has spread virally as a meme template because of its adaptability across eras and industries, from ancient slavery to modern gig economies. Its continued use reflects both the enduring visibility of forced labor as a historical phenomenon and the way internet humor reframes violence, exploitation, and systemic injustice through brevity and irony, forcing audiences to reckon with the disturbing banality of oppression.",0,1759152414.0,Jokes,3,0.11,False
1nthyph,https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingiswrong2024/comments/1nthyph/followup_about_my_post_from_yesterday_about_white/,Follow-Up about my post from yesterday about white males.,"The divide between even those of us here in this sub is reaching monumental highs based upon the reaction to my last post. 

I wanted to take a minute to clarify what I was talking about when I actually have coffee in my stomach.

First off, as i said yesterday (in the comments, but I should have said it in the post) i am not at all trying to deny that white males are *by far* the most likely to commit firearm related violent offenses. 

I do believe that anybody who has been living in the US or even just loosely following US news is aware of this.

White males committing violent crimes is about as far away as you can possibly get from saying something is new.

There are people in this sub who have been active before and are calling out white males. (That's 100% fair game) 

However, I made the post to draw attention to the number of bots and astroturfers who are now all of a sudden crawling out of the woodwork on reddit/FB/X etc... to scream as loud as they can, and in tandem, that it's not MAGA who is violent (it is), or the left (the left is not violent) but that white people are violent. These bots have 0 engagement in any prior Left leaning space at all. They are completely empty profiles that then all of a sudden come online and talk about how scary white males are in multiple subs/pages/spaces.

This is a mass coordinated effort to create further divide.

It is working.

Don't feed in to it.

*White Males* are not violent.

 For every 1 white male who commits a violent crime there are hundreds of thousands of white males who dont.

*Extreme right wing white males who have been brought up holding firearms in profile pictures since children, who were born with the silver spoons in their mouths, who were indoctrinated into an extremist religious idealolgy or who exclusively watch fox entertainment for their news are the violent ones.*

The move comes as the company works to streamline operations and focus resources on higher-performing locations, even as it faces growing competition from boutique coffee chains and at-home brewing.

The closures are part of a larger cost-cutting effort, reflecting both commodity inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Starbucks is also leaning more heavily on its loyalty program, drive-thru, and mobile ordering as it tries to offset in-store declines.

**Key takeaways:**

* 500 U.S. stores to close, targeting underperforming locations.
* Coffee bean prices have surged, adding pressure to already thin margins.
* Starbucks will lean harder on loyalty, drive-thru, and app ordering.
* Comes as indie shops, convenience stores, and at-home premium coffee compete for share.

It hit me how much this album feels designed for a format like this — long movements, quiet build-ups, and those sudden waves that Tool does better than anyone. Each side gave me space to breathe, almost like the band forcing you to live in the tension before letting it go.

I’ve listened to it digitally plenty of times, but on wax the sound has this weight and warmth that pulls you in differently. The bass feels more alive, the drums more ritualistic, and those atmospheric layers seem to expand into the room instead of just playing in it. It’s less about hearing the music and more about being inside of it.

And of course, the packaging. Tool never treats a record like just a container, it’s part of the whole trip. Holding it, flipping it, staring at the artwork while the songs unravel — it all feeds into the immersion.

It reminded me why I collect vinyl in the first place: not just to listen, but to experience.

Six months ago her mom pulled me aside at a family barbecue and said I deserved better than her daughter. She kept going on about how my wife was ""too focused on work"" and ""not giving me the attention a man needs."" Her mom suggested I should ""explore my options"" because ""life is short.""

Two weeks later her cousin started texting me. Nothing major at first, just memes and random stuff. Then she started complaining about her boyfriend. I should have stopped it there but her mom's words kept echoing in my head.

""You're such a good listener,"" the cousin said one night after we'd been texting for hours. ""My boyfriend never talks to me like this.""

""Your cousin doesn't really talk to me much anymore either,"" I replied.

The cousin suggested we meet for coffee. Just as friends, she said. We met three times before anything happened. The fourth time we ended up in her apartment.

I told myself it was just physical. That my wife and I had grown apart anyway. The cousin kept saying things like ""You deserve someone who appreciates you"" and ""I can't believe she takes you for granted.""

This went on for two months. I was living a double life and hating myself for it. But every time I tried to end it, the cousin would cry and say she was falling for me. Her mom would make little comments about how much happier I seemed lately.

Then my wife found the texts.

She was using my laptop because hers was charging. The messages with her cousin popped up automatically. She read everything. Two years of marriage ended in that moment.

""Get out,"" she said when I walked into our bedroom. Her voice was completely calm, which somehow made it worse.

""Let me explain,"" I said.

""Explain what? How my own family convinced you to cheat on me? How you've been screwing my cousin for months while I was working overtime to save for our vacation?""

I tried to tell her about her mom, about the pressure, about how confused I'd been. She just stared at me.

""Pack your stuff. You have one hour.""

I called her mom thinking she'd help smooth things over. Big mistake.

""Oh honey,"" her mom said. ""I never told you to have an affair. I just said you deserved better communication in your marriage.""

The cousin blocked my number that same day. Her mom started telling everyone I ""misunderstood"" her advice and that she was ""shocked and disappointed"" in my choices.

My wife filed for divorce immediately. She took half our savings, kept the house, and somehow convinced my own parents that I was entirely in the wrong. They let her move into their guest room while I'm stuck in a studio apartment.

""We raised you better than this,"" my dad said when I tried to explain. ""She's family now and you threw it away.""

The worst part is my wife won't even look at me. I see her at my parents' house sometimes when I visit. She'll get up and leave the room. My mom makes me wait outside if my wife is there for dinner.

Everyone knows. Her whole family, my family, our mutual friends. The cousin is back with her boyfriend like nothing happened. Her mom acts like she barely knows me at family gatherings.

I lost the woman I actually loved for someone who was just using me to get back at her own boyfriend. My wife was loyal, hardworking, and planning our future while I was busy destroying it.

Am I wrong for thinking her family set me up to fail?

September 29

**Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.**

**ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89**

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group's secretary an unquotable name and walked out. I was glad he was there – once again I saw what I had been like. But I also saw what I still am, and what I still could be. I don't have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention. I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being. The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.

Sometimes i had to force it and put in a lot of energy to get out of bed to try to find the energy to even feel happy , and sometimes i still failed. But i kept trying hard every day. At first i tried Pokemon go for awhile catching a shiny or something cool, it was a lot of WORK but it definitely would trigger my reward system! (It did get boring after awhile though so i had to drop it) It was a nice distraction in the beginning though.

Animals helped always. Going to visit and play with shelter animals. Zoos. Pet stores became addicting. Exotic fish stores are like a free aquarium lol. Farms that are open to the public are normally free and would give me that instant dopamine.

My boyfriend and i also started doing coffee dates or runs. This felt special because we were planning around a drink.. The same way we used to with alcohol. (We didn't even like coffee but we do now) And will just sit in a cafe and drink our fun drinks. Coffee can apparently cause a light buzz , stemming from the excitement, wired feeling and focus! I personally am not one of those lucky people who get wired from caffeine but still looking forward to a special drink makes me feel like I'm treating myself. Anyways The hardest hurdle is TIME. You could do all these things but if you're still 1 or 5 weeks in early sobriety its still going to be hard to feel excited for things that soon. Your dopamine doesn't just come back even if you do these things that early on in sobriety I wanted to mention them though because i do feel like they really helped me speed up the rut in the beginning or if i felt really bad, these things definitely helped.

Also, Vitamins , Vitamins!! Take them! I did extensive research early sobriety and A LOT , AND I MEAN A LOT of vitamin deficiencies can cause depression. And guess what alcohol does? It lowers almost ALL your vitamin levels. So chances are if you were a drinker you're probably deficient. A daily multi-vitamin wouldn't hurt.

I want to mention one last thing that is kind of odd and might be specific to me. But before i was sober i remember Facebook memories would pop up and It was always a beer or some form of me being under the influence of alcohol. It would be like a daily reminder ""Look! 4 years ago, and you're still alcoholic"" , Or the worst ""You were drinking on this same day 4 years ago & you're drinking now 4 years later today also!"" These memories became so frequent it started to trigger extreme guilt. It was the beginning of realizing i had a problem. Idk why this is what put it in perspective for me, Maybe i was so immersed with alcohol that time was non existent to me or i was subconsciously ignoring it. Having a daily reminder like that though kind of helped? It helped me realize how bad it was , because i was always drunk i was so delusional about having a problem. So now i make it a goal to actually create GOOD memories. I feel like im making up for the time i missed out on. I go on adventures and road trips now. Using the money i save from drinking on mini vacations instead. I'm going to a cave next weekend! lol. I flood my feed with these new memories to replace the bad. Its so healing. I cant wait for future me to look back on memories and see the happy memories I'm creating instead of just being reminded of guilt and regret for drinking and doing the same exact thing for years.",11,1759150931.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

I wanted to share some positive things I've had while taking Pristiq and how I went from 100mg to 25mg and feel better than I did at 100mg. Things aren't always smooth sailing though, I'll save that for the end, it mostly has to do with me being sensitive to other supplements that can interact with serotonin/norepinephrine. I used to be on Effexor for depression and some mild anxiety, and while it worked it came at a cost: no libido, high blood pressure, tired, and if I missed a dose the withdrawal was HELL! I had a great nurse practitioner at the time who helped me a lot and I got approval by my insurance to try Pristiq at the time (about 8 years ago). I call Pristiq a cleaned up version of Effexor; it's not perfect, but the side effects weren't nearly as bad, especially if I missed a dose (though I would start to feel withdrawal later in the evening if I didn't take it that morning, but not as bad as Effexor withdrawal). I tried 50mg and then 100mg, but eventually landed at 25mg and I honestly wish they had a 12.5 mg I could take. Here is what I did to balance it all, because the most important thing to remember is to not rely on the pill to do all the work. 

* EXERCISE - most important thing. You need to do something that gets your heart rate going, and makes you sweat. Do this a few times a week as the foundation.
* Vitamin D3 - so essential, I would take 3,000 - 5,000 IUs per day when first starting and then take only 2,000 per day in the summer (get vitamin D from sunlight) and about 4,000 IU per day in winter. Also take vitamin K2 with D3 because vitamin K2 takes the calcium that the vitamin D produces and puts it where it's supposed to go in your body (the bones, teeth, etc. and keeps it out of your blood).
* Probiotics - they're discovering a big issue with the cause of many mental illnesses is an issue with the gut/brain connection from early childhood (Formula babies, too many antibiotics when we were young, genetics, diet, etc) bottom line is take care of your gut health because it produces most of our serotonin. I would take a daily probiotic and eat lots of fiber, I noticed a huge increase in my mood and well being. 
* Sunlight - we need the Sun, just don't get sunburned. The Sun gives us Vitamin D and also its infrared produces melatonin which is a potent antioxidant and helps regulate sleep. 
* Cut out as much sugar and excess carbs as possible. 
* Limit alcohol as much as possible - it's just not worth it anymore. The older I get the worse I feel after drinking it. 
* Fuzzy things - get a cat or dog, they are nature's antidepressant. 

I hope to someday be off of Pristiq simply to not have to rely on or have a prescription, but I'll have to see. In my late 20s (I'm 44 now) I tapered off Effexor way too fast and had horrible physical anxiety and panic attacks from it, I don't want to ever relive that again. I have noticed the big frustrating thing about taking an SNRI like Pristiq is the amount of things that interact with it even in the smallest of ways. Example; I can't take too much whey protein, it will boost my serotonin too much and I'll feel ""off"". Things like nutmeg, ginko biloba, heck even coffee, can affect serotonin levels and all of us have different sensitivities (I am very sensitive to these things). Hang in there everyone, you are never alone and always remember that we're learning more and more about the human brain and body each and every day. ",4,1759150831.0,Pristiq,0,1.0,False

[21f & 30m],"TL,DR: My sister (24f) doesn't approve of my (21f) relationship with my boyfriend (30m), solely because of our age gap. ""People at those ages can't be eye level"". Is she right? - How can I convince her otherwise? 
---
To give y'all some details:

*How the relationship started*:
I (21f) met my now boyfriend Luke (30m) two years ago through a college course. He was a tutor, I was a student. We both immediately felt the chemistry, but decided to keep our distance, because we were both uncomfortable with the student-tutor dynamic. Still, because of the mutual interest, we slowly progressed to after tutoring coffee, preparing dinner together, and at some point, casual sex. He was the initiator of it, since I was hesitant to get too close to someone 9 years older than me & with a power dynamic, but I slowly allowed myself to let me fall into the dynamic and  the emotional bond that was forming. We had a lot of deep, sometimes very emotional conversations about pretty much every topic you could think of, whether it is religious belief, childhood, utopic and dystopic perspectives.. 
We both enjoyed spending our time together, and the hangouts consisted much more of conversation and cuddling than sex. 
Because of some outer circumstances, we parted ways (personally and geographically) after a few months. I knew that at that point, he had developed romantic feelings for me, but I by far was not ready to commit to a partner at that point in my life. 

We went seperate ways for about a year, with a few ""catch-ups"" in-between, that stayed platonic and distanced. 
Beginning of 2025, I went through a difficult situation, and needed someone to talk to who wasn't involved in the situation, but would be able to understand and guve advice and solace. He always emphasized that I can always reach out, so I gave him a call and we met up to talk about my struggle in that specific situation. 
Afterwards, I felt a lot better, and we parted ways for the evening. I realized through that conversation how well he knew me, my emotions, and how amazingly empathetic he could lead me through the reflection process, which was something I had partly forgotten over the year of no contact. 
Shortly afterwards, he texted me to ask if I wanted to hang out again, and since I was single, had no other plans and was craving some intimacy, I was interested to meet up and see where it leads us, potentially reviving the causal sex deal we had going in the very beginning. There were many difficult conversations to be had, about our past, the emotional hurt of his unreciprocated feelings he had endured, and also my personal development over the years. It was clear to him that he wanted to keep me at a distance, while I wanted to fight for a chance at an actual relationship with him. 
[Different life circumstances, since we were now both settled with our individual lives, a lot of reflection happened..]. 
Well, it took us a few months to rebuild trust and allow feelings to grow, but we did build an amazing foundation for us to explore the relationship. We have been happily dating for 6 months now, got through a few tough discussions, and have our mutual goals in clear view.  
---
I know people are usually critical of age gap relationships. I believe that of course, an age gap poses a risk for unhealthy dynamics, but that doesn't mean that it has to be like that. To build my case for me, *more info about me and the boyfriend*:

Since I my late teens, I had to be a fully independent individual. Between a dead and an addicted parent, there wasn't much trusted adult support there in my life. No inheritance either, so I had to build my entire life foundation on my own. I graduated, chose smart ways to educate and qualify myself for a great job I am passionate about, and I am now also enrolled in university with an all expenses covered scholarship. I live in my dream appartement, am financially doing well, can afford a good life standard + vacations, and am overall in a good place. I am not looking for ""adventurous 20s,"" my life has been adventurous enough. I enjoy the calm that my foundation offers me and am ready to enjoy my life as it comes. 

Luke has had a different life path, secure family support, more room to figure himself out. He now has reached a place in life where he knows in which way he wants to develop his future, he also has a similar job and is enrolled in uni (2yrs above my grade). He has to cover his own study expenses, so in that way, I have more financial freedom than him. 

We both want to focus on friends, hobbys, travelling and education before settling down, but after we both graduate university, we picture a family life with kids, in a calm area. Our future plans align well in that regard. 

Our relationship is very balanced, we complement each other well. I am a bit more driven, he's more calm, we both benefit from each other's feature. We both enjoy spontaneous trips and spending time with each other, but value our individual time with friends and hobbies equally as much. Both of us communicate emotions and needs openly and honestly, even when it is tough. We work on finding a compromise that works best for the both of us, and are very gentle and caring toward each other. Practically, there is no apparent issue that would pose as a red flag to me. Both of our close friends know the two of us and are genuinely excited about our relationship. His family invited me to a family holiday and for Christmas as well. 


Only issue so far? 
My sister. 
She (24f) is my only close relative. Our relationship has been very close over all these years, and I was happy to share my luck and genuine happiness with her when Luke and I actually started dating this year. Note, she does not know about our previous history! At first, she was equally excited for me - until I sent her a picture of me and Luke together.
""...How old is he?!"" - that was the only answer I got, followed by a long discussion about age gaps and how ""we can never be eye level"" and that she is ""just concerned I am falling into the arms of a creepy man"", that ""even thinking we could be eye level proves that I am too immature and young"".. You get the deal. This has been the state for 6 months now, she avoids the topic at all costs, and whenever I mention Luke, she doesn't answer or evades the conversation. 

I understand her fear for me. She has not met Luke yet. Still, it hurts me that she isn't even open to give him a fair chance. To her, it is obvious that the age gap alone is an absolute deal breaker for any healthy relationship. 

Do you think she has a point? 
Should I be more worried than I am about the age gap? 
If you do believe that the relationship can work, what's a good way to let my sister see that, too? 
[All efforts of explaining have not worked. She will not budge..] 

Thank you for reading this novel of a post, I am looking forward to all your insights. :)

Edit: To clarify, this wasn't a traditional student-teacher relationship. We are talking about a course that is only a few weeks long, with peer-to-peer tutoring. He would not have lost this job if anyone official knew about the private relationship.

She had red curly hair and a pale face and light brown eyes, but when we begin to talk it it felt so natural we had a lot in common but we were pretty different anyway I live in Sweden and she told me she came from Germany but had moved to Sweden when she was 11 years old she told me she was interested in art and I'm an artist and I told her I had been interested in Germany for many years she was a bit surprised  by that and she asked me what interest me about Germany
and I told her I was interested in the music and the history and how they have gotten from a country who had been vulnerable and destroyed into a country that is today she laughed and wondered, find I knew Germany i've been pretty great and successful country before the war 
I told her that I knew that and you had many great writers and artists and other people
But let me get back to story last night I had a hard time to fall asleep and suddenly I heard she begin to talk in her sleep first in German and I understand German so I heard about she said she began to talk about who she used to be inside of people heads but that she got bored and decide she would change her career
Then she    began to talk Swedish
and said she remember, she used to be in a five year old girl head and she remembered how her parents tried to cure the little girl, but when it didn't work, they get desperate so desperate that they went to an exorcist and that made her so angry that she killed the girl suddenly I must have fallen asleep because in the morning when I went up, she stood in the kitchen.

The concept might be helpful in other areas to know how Boldin is using some of your inputs.

Apparently Boldin will store/save the cost basis information at the time of recording the Money Flow Transfer. Still working on confirming this but my coffee is running out :( 

Here's my exchange with the chatbot:

`Q. If I change the cost basis for the mutual fund today, and then create a Money Flow Transfer for a sale date earlier this year, and then change the cost basis back to the current amount after saving that transfer, are you saying that the temporary cost basis amount that I used while submitting the sale information for earlier this year will remain in the Money Flow Transfer even after I change this after I've saved that transfer?`

`A. Yes, exactly! Once you save the transfer with the temporary cost basis, that calculation is locked in for the transfer. The platform captures the cost basis at the time you create the transfer, so changing it afterward won't affect the already-saved transfer's tax calculation.`

`This is why the workaround works - the transfer ""remembers"" the cost basis you had when you created it, giving you the accurate capital gains calculation for your past sale.`",3,1759150296.0,Boldin,0,1.0,False

I've been geocaching less than a month and this is my first puzzle of this type and I'm at a loss of how to solve it. Lots of people have solved it so it can't be too difficult, right? 

In the body of the text there are three words in bold. Marketplace, shekel, and prepares.

Description: 

This cache IS NOT at the posted coordinates.  Figure out the puzzle to find out what the real/hidden coordinates of the cache are.

Daydreaming About a Cool Job

I was on my way to the marketplace, and was looking up different types of plaster casts, and came across this interesting fact on Wikipedia:

""The London cast of Dippy is a plaster cast replica of the fossilised bones of a Diplodocus carnegii skeleton, the original of which - also known as Dippy - is on display at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History.""  It was an interesting fact, and right then and there, I thought that I'd like very much to go and see it sometime.

But, why am I thinking of a dinosaur while out at the supermarket?  I'm not 100% sure why I stopped to think about this after putting my car in park and turning the engine off.  But, here I was deep in thought before going in to get coffee, creamer, fruit and other items, paid with a shekel or two.

So, I've seen many dinosaurs bones assembled, both very small and massive in museums.  But, right now the thought just now crossed my mind about who or what fitter or assembler qualifications someone would require to put these massive and micro skelatons together, and prepares them for museums.  I think I might actually like doing that job, because I like puzzles.  It would be fun to put one of those huge beasts together.  Don't you think?

I searched in vain on the internet for jobs and qualifications for such a job, but the search engine kept dropping or not finding one or two of the three words I was using.  I kept ending up finding jobs for assembly lines or cute kindergarten videos showing little kids putting toy dinosaur bones together.  It was all very entertaining, but I was interrupted by a reminder from my lovely wife about getting the groceries and getting home - instead of sitting in the car daydreaming about a cool job in a museum somewhere assembling monster bones.

Find Out Now!","Cryptocurrency adoption continues to accelerate across diverse sectors in 2025, with prominent brands and industries embracing digital assets not only as a store of value but also as a practical means of payment. From everyday coffee shops to luxury car dealerships, the integration of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP into mainstream transactions signals a significant shift toward a crypto-enabled economy. As infrastructure and regulatory environments mature, more small businesses and global companies are making it simpler to spend and accept cryptocurrencies, further embedding blockchain into daily life and commerce.\
\
\
  \
    Major retailers, restaurants, and coffee shops now accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP through apps and third-party payment processors.\
    Travel platforms and airlines are increasingly enabling crypto payments for bookings, flights, and luxury travel experiences.\
    High-end brands and luxury car dealers are integrating crypto payments for premium goods and real estate purchases.\
    Payment processors facilitate seamless crypto acceptance for small businesses by instant conversion and reduced compliance complexities.\
  \
\
\
Cryptocurrencies have evolved from niche assets to integral components of modern financial systems by 2025. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP (XRP) are now common options for both everyday spending and strategic investments. Their combined strengths—Bitcoin as a value store, Ethereum’s robust smart contract ecosystem, and XRP’s efficiency in cross-border payments—make them versatile tools for businesses seeking to leverage blockchain technology.\
\
Everyday crypto transactions: Coffee shops, restaurants, retailers\
For many crypto holders, making daily purchases with digital assets is becoming routine. Acceptance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP extends from coffee shops to supermarkets, with various apps and platforms simplifying these transactions. XRP tends to be more prominent in backend and cross-border payment solutions, leaving fewer POS options for direct retail acceptance.\
\
Coffee shops and small eateries\
In 2025, paying for coffee with crypto is no longer a sci-fi concept. Chain giants like Starbucks facilitate crypto payments via gift cards, allowing customers to use Ether or Bitcoin for their favorite beverages. Digital wallets such as Flexa’s SPEDN make crypto-to-cash conversions straightforward at checkout. Smaller independent vendors and convenience stores—including Sheetz—also accept Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies, making everyday transactions faster and more flexible.\
\
Restaurants and fast food places\
Crypto-friendly zones now include select McDonald’s outlets, where Bitcoin payments are possible via dedicated apps. Chains like Subway and Burger King often rely on third-party gift card services, enabling customers to spend their crypto with minimal fuss. Steak ‘n Shake notably expanded BTC acceptance nationwide in 2025, attributing an 11% sales increase to this move. Other fast-food giants such as Chipotle and Baskin-Robbins also accept crypto payments through BitPay, making digital currencies more practical for quick meals and treats.\
\
Retail and online stores\
Tech giants are integrating crypto into their payment systems: AT&T allows bill payments with ETH or BTC, while Microsoft accepts Bitcoin directly or through processors. E-commerce platforms like Shopify have simplified crypto acceptance for millions of merchants. Big-box retailers such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Ikea utilize Bitrefill or BitPay gift cards for crypto-based purchases, from home renovation supplies to electronics. AMC Theatres accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP for tickets and entertainment content, further extending crypto’s retail reach.\
\
Scaling up: Travel and luxury\
The travel industry is adopting cryptocurrencies for booking flights, hotels, and luxury experiences. Platforms like Travala.com enable users to pay with BTC, ETH, and other assets. Major airlines, including Emirates and AirBaltic, have incorporated crypto payments; Emirates plans to accept crypto through partnerships with providers like Crypto.com. Luxury brands and high-end car dealerships—such as Post Oak Motor Cars—now accept Bitcoin for premium purchases, reflecting growing demand for crypto in the luxury market. Brands like Gucci and Ralph Lauren have expanded their crypto payment offerings at flagship stores, signaling broader acceptance among high-net-worth consumers.\
\
Financial services, remittances, and institutional use\
Beyond consumer transactions, blockchain is transforming cross-border remittances, treasury management, and institutional holdings. XRP, with its fast settlement capabilities, remains favored for remittances, while companies like Mercury FX trial XRP for cost-effective transfers. Payment gateways like PayPal, BitPay, and NOWPayments facilitate seamless cryptocurrency acceptance for businesses, reducing exposure to volatile prices. Some firms, including BitMine and VivoPower, hold cryptocurrencies to hedge against inflation and optimize treasury strategies, showing increasing corporate adoption.\
\
\
  \
\
\
How can small businesses adopt crypto payments?\
Step 1: Choose a payment processor\
Platforms like BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, and CoinGate streamline crypto integration for SMBs. They automatically convert digital assets into fiat currency, mitigating volatility risk and simplifying accounting.\
\
Step 2: Reduce compliance costs\
Automated tax reporting tools and clearer regulatory frameworks help lower the legal and financial burdens on small enterprises, making crypto acceptance more feasible.\
\
Step 3: Embrace a broader range of assets\
Lower technical barriers and improved compliance enable businesses to confidently accept other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, diversifying their options.\

For example, I noticed the body likes to cope with hyperarousal/ anxiety/ fight and flight response through the pelvic floor, with sensations such as an urge to relax and release, could be any stimulation, such as caffeine and dairy that act as a stimulus for inducing a thorough diarrhea incontinence, or sexual fantasy day dreaming from a limerant object as a stimulus for inducing an orgasm. 

Quite predictable physiological response patterns I've observed. 

My guess is, what seems to be uncontrollably incontinence in trauma survivors/ people who live with complex ptsd, is actually what the body does to self regulate. Especially during times of distress, dissociation, high level of cortisone. The body actually feels good and it helps with the release of hormones to have a massive bowel movement.

For instance, this morning I woke up I already had bowel movement, however instead of defecating naturally without stimulation, I chose to hold on to the bowel movement and have a laxative coffee with dairy hot drink, because I felt anxious and not really ready for fight or flight, to deal with the highly stressful, trauma reliving which is inevitable if I want to function today and work, which includes dealing with things that will trigger painful traumatic crimes reliving and its hyper aroused sensations revolved around it. 

I needed the stimulants to match my own emotions to feel okay within my body. 

So instead of having a normal poo that isn't a diarrhea, I chose to have a thorough stimulation release subconsciously, because that is what my body is physiologically urging / craving to do unconsciously to self regulate.

The brain can unconsciously dissociate from the bodily awareness, however the body would still run the autonomous nervous system function regardless of the prefrontal cortex has control/ awareness or not. 

I've also observed the pattern on other people, the ones who really like stimulants, such as those pre-work out drinks, coffee, are people who are anxious already to begin with, and we just want to regulate the physio response by accepting it chemically. 

So by ingesting something that has a chemical reaction which matches our physio reaction, it feels as if it's okay to feel such way. 

Another example I can remember, is when I used to stay in an airport stuck there due to complex trauma freeze and unable to move, I was actually so hyper aroused and stressed I started to have double incontinence really badly, which was so scary and I had to clean in public disabled toilets all the time. 

It's that dichotomous reaction of being both hyper and hypo aroused, frozen yet needing to flight. It's so draining and takes so much energy out of me to fight both of those energetic entities. 

I also noticed when I felt really cold my urinary tract can act up, because the cold induced shakiness anxiety, the shiver really reminds the nervous system of the fight and flight arousal again. 

I believe it is the equivalent to the adhd stimming behavior. An unconscious attempt to repeat compulsively to feel a sense of control. 

I also feel hyperarousal when im hurt or violated in anyway. It can feel the same as sexual arousal but it's only the same physio response, the underlying cause and energy is different. 

For example when the adult school bullies criminals abuse me, rob me, rape me, harm me, which can include those people who have a job as police or medical workers. I always felt a sense of arousal. 

When I feel betrayal trauma from an intimate relationship I feel the same sensation. 

I highly correlate that with my astrological charts as well,  I'll write it up again soon.  ",0,1759150069.0,ShadowWork,0,0.5,False

Before adding any extra support, I noticed that when pressing hard on the brake pedal, the plate tended to tilt forward a bit. Because of that, I decided to add a strap to secure the pedal plate to the rig’s mounting plate, just for extra stability and peace of mind.

Now I’m wondering — am I being overly cautious here? Has anyone else done something similar, or is the single row of threads actually more than enough to hold it firmly in place?",1,1759149776.0,Thrustmaster,0,1.0,False

1ntgwzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1ntgwzd/engaged_but_still_treated_like_an_outsider_by_my/,"Engaged, but still treated like an outsider by my MIL","I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years now. I've known his parents pretty much since the beginning of our relationship. We're getting married next year. However, I've always felt that his parents never truly accepted me as part of the family. I think they like me, but they always keep some distance (which, to a certain extent, I understand).

We've been engaged for a little more than a year. Before we got engaged, we used to spend holidays separately with our own families. But for the past two years, we've been trying to spend those days together because we get really sad when we have to be apart.

However, this Easter, my future mother-in-law raised an issue because we weren't going to spend Easter Sunday at their house (we had spent the previous year at my parents' place). The decision was simply made out of convenience, since my parents’ house is closer to where we live, so it would save us from having to go back and forth.

To make up for it, we planned to spend Friday afternoon, evening, and the whole of Saturday with my future in-laws. I understand that it wasn't on Easter Sunday itself, but in his family there aren't any special traditions — it's usually just a lunch, which could be on Saturday or Sunday. My family, on the other hand, has specific traditions for that day.

When my future mother-in-law found out we wouldn’t be there on Sunday, she made a huge scene and even said to my boyfriend, *“You're not married yet, so you shouldn't be splitting the holidays,”* clearly implying that she wanted her son there — but not me.

Another recent situation was when we were having coffee together, and I playfully touched my boyfriend’s hair. He jokingly started pulling away, and she made a comment like, *“He's still mine, calm down.”* At the time I replied with something very quietly, which I think she didn’t hear, because I don’t like confrontations.  
This Saturday we went to their house for lunch, and once again she made a point of clearly saying that I am a guest, after my boyfriend said there was no need for formalities because we were among family.

These are just some of the more recent examples. There were other times when she made hurtful comments about me to her sister while I was in the room (and other times I assume, because of things his aunt commented to us). They weren’t serious things, but they still hurt.

The thing is, I’m really sad and I have no one to talk to. I am a very private person and my boyfriend is my best friend. I don’t want to badmouth my future mother-in-law, but I also don’t want to talk to my boyfriend about it because I know his mother’s attitude hurts him too.

The Easter situation led to a long discussion between us, and there have been other things in the past too - like when she asked him not to tell me something because it was “a family matter.” He already spoke to her gently, and when she makes some comments he sticks up for me, but most of the times he does not hear or thinks is not that bad. He understands that the comments make me feel sad, but his relationship with his parents isn’t the best. In fact, his relationship with them actually improved after we started dating, because he saw the relationship I have with my own parents, and I also encouraged him to try to give more attention to his. But they are people who use a lot of emotional blackmail and are super overbearing. For example, not long ago, because of the distance, we ended up sleeping at their place and got home quite late. In the morning, they asked my boyfriend what time we had arrived. He's very absent-minded, so he said an earlier time than when we actually got in. Right away, they started accusing him of lying. When I joined them, they asked me the same question, clearly to see if I would lie too (which I didn’t, because I knew perfectly well that they had stayed up just to check what time we got home).

Another thing I can had is that I know she sees me as a threat and thinks I’m stealing her son from her. She’s very religious and conservative. She doesn’t let anyone do anything in her house (her husband and son are treated like babies). Even though I’m also conservative at a certain point, I’m a very independent woman and I grew up in a home where my dad did everything - cooking, sewing socks, cleaning, you name it. My boyfriend also does everything at home, and she knows that. But she still treats him like he’s useless. At her house, he doesn’t do anything, because she doesn’t let him.

I'm really sad because I thought things had gotten better over the past few years. They've started to talk about some family issues in front of me, which felt like a sign of acceptance. But these recent situations made it clear that she still doesn’t see me as family, and that really hurts.",6,1759149577.0,Mildlynomil,4,0.88,False

more reading, more self-improvement, more focus. all postponed.  
but life never slows, does it. tomorrow always fills up.

then i noticed something.  
it wasn’t lack of time. it was the way i thought growth had to look. like big courses, long books, massive effort. so i avoided it.

the shift was tiny: take in something useful in 2–3 minutes. then *apply one small action right away*.  
turns out when you break learning into snack sized pieces, you stop waiting for the “perfect moment” and start stacking wins daily.

example: one short lesson on saying “no” politely → i used it at work the same afternoon.  
another: 2-min tip on starting conversations → helped me have a better coffee chat the next day.

these micro lessons compound faster than binging a 400-page book you never finish.  
i even started using an app around this kind of swipable growth, like a netflix-tiktok mashup but for life skills. they’re letting early people in for free with lifetime access so it can get shaped with real feedback. link’s in bio if curious.

Hi everyone,  
I’ve been lurking in this community for a while, and I just wanted to share a bit of my story and ask for some input if that’s okay.

I’m a software engineer, and for the last few years, I’ve been heavily dependent on caffeine — multiple coffees, energy drinks, you name it. At first, it helped me “function”, but over time it started to ruin my sleep, spike my anxiety, and mess with my mood. I realized I was just constantly tired, even *with* the caffeine. It felt like I was stuck in a loop.

I’ve tried quitting cold turkey (multiple times), and also tapering, but I always end up going back because I never had a clear understanding of how much caffeine I was actually consuming — especially with different drinks and timings.

So I recently started building a little tool — mostly for myself — that tracks what I consume and gives me a running estimate of how much caffeine is in my system. The goal is to help me see patterns, understand when I’m going over my limit, and eventually taper down in a more informed way.

It’s still early, and I’m not sure if it’s going to work long term. But I was wondering:

* Have any of you tried tracking your caffeine during your quitting or tapering process?
* What would’ve helped you most in those early days?
* Would you find it helpful to get gentle reminders or suggestions throughout the day?

I’m not here to promote anything — it’s not public or anything like that. I’m just trying to figure out if this approach even makes sense, and this community seems like the best place to ask.

Thanks for reading and thanks to everyone here who shares their stories — honestly, this sub has helped me feel a lot less alone.

We communicated for about a week and he was consistent and he shows a lot of interest in me and can tell he is looking for something serious. We just had our first date yesterday. He asked me out for coffee and he also picked a place. I thought we were going to order together but he kinda stood behind me so I paid for my coffee. This is definitely not a dealbreaker but I have never paid for my dates and he is the one asked me out so I found it odd he didn’t offer to pay and made me think he didn’t like me in person first. (I want to make this clear that I am definitely capable of paying for my coffee/meal but I’m used to dating traditional men so this surprised me a little bit) Actually the date went pretty well and so far he is pretty much everything I am looking for and at the end of the date he said “My goal is to make you my girlfriend one day”. He texted me after to make sure I got home safe and we texted throughout the day. He told me that he already told his mom about us and she is happy for us. He also calls me his dream girl. I feel like he is moving too fast a little bit but I appreciate he shows a lot of interest in me. I tend to overthink so I guess I still want to know why he didn’t want to pay for my coffee? I know it’s just coffee but do you think he was disappointed in me in person a little bit? Or is he saying these nice things to keep me as an option until he meets someone?  ,0,1759149313.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.4,False

I started as a barista back in high school and fell in love with the company and everything it stood for, and now I don’t even recognize the hellscape it’s become. I am absolutely floored by how exponentially worse things are getting seemingly by the week, and I’m still hearing it from my former coworkers that the pressure is only mounting. I jumped ship when I felt it starting to sink, but I have some kind of survivor’s guilt hearing all the news the past couple of days about all the long-time partners losing their jobs with a whopping 72 hours notice and a shit severance package. They only closed one store in my area so far (built from the ground up and opened earlier this year), but thousands of partners are affected by this, be it directly or indirectly, and I can’t get it off my mind.

I’m still pretty new to the espresso game and could use some advice. I’m trying to dial in some beans from Golden Brown Coffee on my Breville Barista Express but can’t seem to get them right.

Here’s what I’ve got so far:
	•	Internal burr grind size: 4
	•	External grind dial: 9
	•	Dose: 18g in
	•	Yield: 36g out in ~30 seconds

On paper that seems “normal,” but my shots always taste sour. If I grind finer, the machine chokes and nothing comes out. If I go coarser, the shot runs way too fast.

I even tried following their recent YouTube video, but I’m still stuck.

Since I’m new to this, I’d love to hear your tips — should I be pushing finer and adjusting dose/yield, or going coarser and pulling longer shots to balance things out?

Any advice would be much appreciated

The Post Embargo has a great blend. I got notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and through the retrohale, some leathery and nutty notes. 
I like coffee and chocolatey notes in a cigar a lot, especially when they’re present for the full length of the stick. This Post Embargo definitely didn’t disappoint. The leathery and nuttiness in the cigar played well with the chocolate and coffee and made for a really great blend of flavors.

Towards the final third there was a toasty spiciness that was introduced but just on the undertone and the cigar didn’t really start to get that bitterness until smoking well after the band. 

Construction was great as to be expected from Alec Bradley. No soft spots, great burn, with just a slightly more firm draw which maybe a second cut would’ve fixed but it was fine for me so I left it alone. The only thing I could really make a complaint on is, I wish it was a bit stronger in those flavor notes.

No VP- stayed at a hotel on the DRL though


TLDR:
Arrived 7:10 on a Monday
Walk on to Poohs Hunny Hunt
DPA Beauty and the Beast 9:25
PP for haunted mansion 10:2
Pirates of the Caribbean 12 pm, 20 ish min wait
Roger rabbit 1 pm ish, 20 ish min wait
Peter Pan 1:30 pm ish, 30 ish min wait
Monsters inc. 3 pm, said 30 min wait but was actually 15 
Sat for villain parade 3:45-4:30
PP thunder mountain 5:15 
Went to hotel for a while
Back for electric parade around 6:45
Parade done about 8 pm 
Went to pirates 5 min wait

Wasn’t really rushing, felt like I got everything I wanted.  Based on other posts I’d say this is a very standard TDL day. We def could have fit more if we tried


Arrived about 7:10, I thought it was a lot of people already and it was warm, luckily the clouds helped us out a bit while waiting. Definitely glad we brought mats and umbrella to site and hide when sun was out! Was through security 7:45 ish and waiting in line to enter the park, I’d say 40-50 people back in line 11. They did not open early. 

Walked in and got BB for 9:25, walked on “8 min” wait for Pooh, and booked haunted mansion for 10:25. Then wandered to shop and eat, got on Pirates around 12 pm with 25 min wait, really was  about 20, line moved well. Stopped for the Halloween special pumpkin milk swirl ice cream, I thought was very good. 
Found our way to toon town for Roger rabbit, walked in 12:57 wait said 20 min, but we were done the ride by 13:17

Went to Peter pans flight around 13:25 with a 30 minute wait posted, was slightly longer than 30. I’d say avoid this line peak day because while it’s mostly shaded, it’s outside/ not AC. Our mistake. Off at 14:02

Went for lunch at china voyager black pepper pork, quite good especially for 1300!!! Then popped to cafe orleans to pick up mobile order for more coffee to combat the noodle snoozies. Then monsters inc was down to 30 min, lowest of the day because it was closed for first few hours. 30 min estimated wait, got in line at 15:00 and it was only 18 minutes.

Then we got a seat for the villain parade and watched that until 16:30. 

Went to queen banquet hall for the vibes and apple tea soda (really did not enjoy their specialty rose tea drink). Then went to our priority pass return time of 17:15 for thunder mountain. 

Then we weren’t really sure what to do between now and the electric parade since we had done all the things we wanted. So we went back to the hotel for a breather and drop heavy bag. Went back to the park for the electrical parade, then hit pirates again 5 min wait

Things I would do differently: 

we had a gap in the middle of the day, I wish we had gone to hotel for a nap so we could power through the evening and hit beauty and the beast one more time. Also it was super hot 11-2:30 so I did not want to be there haha.

The state of things isn’t the safest as a person who has to go to school full time and drive themselves there, so I’ve started drinking cold brew again. It definitely helps me get to the point of being okay enough to function during the day (though frankly nothing seems to help the ADHD symptoms much). Why do doctors seem to insist we don’t drink coffee or any caffeine? I’m in the process of getting on Xywav but there’s insurance shenanigans and cost issues happening.

(and honestly losing clients that you became infrastructure for them is super difficult, but let's imagine I did) - just for the sake of the arguement.

The only focus I will be discussing on this post scenario is the ones below:

AI agents and [make.com](http://make.com/) or N8N or Zapier workflows, CRM builds, inbox automations, simple dashboards. Small teams and agencies love this stuff because it saves them time without hiring. Also, keep in mind that companies that are already online and use servbices are easier to convert that installing automations in a plumber business or to a restaurant. These businesses already work without even the internet, so making them ""automated"" is way way harder. Don't go there... save yourself from the trouble of having to expplain the power of the intertnet to those business owners.

What follows is the same approach I give friends and past colleagues who are starting from zero. Cause yeah after you get on many covnersations and repeateadly mention you have a reatainer client that pays you $500 per month just for ya checkign a few parameters, then they all want to jump in hah.

# The rules for week one

1. Show up daily. If you cannot commit 60 to 90 minutes a day for 10 days, skip this post. Seriously. you got 0 clients right now. what are you doing with your time?
2. Spend a little. Budget $100 to $300 for tools or boosts. You are buying speed. It matters. but I dont have the money...damn man...sell stuff from your house...or go get a job so that you have that money and can actually break free right after from getting your first clients. come on. find solutions. dont buy your coffee daily from outside and cut the other expenses that do not help you and make em boosts for your proposals.
3. Lock your ego in the closet. And let it breathe there until you close your first client. Price at market starter rates, then raise later. Your first goal is wins, not margin. Trust me on this.

# Step 1: put yourself where buyers already hang out

You want three lines in the water at the same time. I run them in parallel. Cause as I said earlier, you got the time in your day to do this. 0 clients...so let's go.

# A) Agency communities

Your first buyers are usually marketing agencies. They need pipelines, CRMs, intake forms, lead routing, reporting, follow up, invoice triggers. They hate doing ops manually. You will be a gift. Or a tiny god.

Join 5 to 10 communities where agency owners talk about their daily struggles. Do not spam them with your offer. Think Facebook groups, Slack workspaces, Discords, small free communities. Ideal size is 500 to 2,000 members. Big enough to find leads. Small enough to be seen. Don't join those spammy communities with 500K members or more where admins just advertise stuff. they do not work.

**Daily schedule for 7 to 10 days**

* Post one helpful how-to that solves a common pain.
* Leave 3 to 5 thoughtful replies under other people’s threads.
* DM anyone who engages with your post or reply.
* DO NOT just spam your offer. you will get kicked out of the group.

**What to post**  
Keep it useful and short. Pick a problem and give the exact steps.

Examples you can adapt:

* “Client onboarding keeps slipping through cracks. Here’s a simple intake → CRM → task creation flow with [make.com](http://make.com/) that takes 30 minutes to set up.”
* “Lost leads in DMs. Quick way to turn every Facebook message into a CRM contact with assigned follow up.”
* “Agencies missing renewals. Add a pipeline stage timer and auto reminders so nothing ages out.”

**DM template**  
“Appreciate your comment on the CRM thread. If you share one bottleneck in your handoff or follow up, I can sketch the exact flow I’d set up. If you want to hash it live, I can hop on a 15 minute screen share today at 3 or 5.”

You are not pitching. You are diagnosing. That is what buyers want. And they do like it a lot. you will see.

# B) Platforms that already have intent

Upwork and Fiverr or other freelance platforms are not beneath you. They are you oxygen when you are new because the buyer already knows they have a problem and wants it solved.

**Upwork setup**

* Headline which names outcomes, not tools: “AI agents and automation systems for agencies” beats “Automation Expert.”
* Non-round rate like 74.60. It reads intentional.
* Top of profile: one paragraph of proof. One line per outcome or logo. Add 2 bullet point case studies with numbers.

**Application process**

* Apply to 3 to 5 jobs per day in Automation, Scripting, CRM, Operations. (tip, search for [make.com](http://make.com/) or N8N in your filters. makes it even more specific and laser focused)
* Boost each proposal by a little. You pay a dollar to get seen first. That dollar prints money if your pitch is tight. Closing a client for $500 and paying $2 to be seen is a good trade off.
* Every proposal starts with a short Loom. Three minutes. Your face and screen. Walk through their post in plain English: what they want, how you would build it, what the end state looks like. Do not send a 10 minute loom video...or even more than 4 mins. Re-shoot it. nobody will watch a 5 plus min loom video. none. so shoot it again! :-)

**Loom outline**

1. 10 seconds: “Saw your post about X. I build flows like this for agencies.”
2. 90 seconds: Show the exact flow. Boxes and arrows. “Form in, validation, tag by source, create deal, assign owner, follow up sequence, Slack alert, dashboard tile.”
3. 30 seconds: “Timeline and budget ballpark. I can start this week.”
4. 10 seconds: “If this looks right, I will send a clean proposal with scope and milestones.”

Text under the Loom is short. Two bullets of proof. One call to action to book.

**Fiverr**  
Create a simple gig for “make.com automation setup or n8n respectively” or “AI agent for lead capture” with three packages. Keep copy direct. Fiverr skews smaller, but small jobs turn into retainer cleanups if you respond fast.

# C) Targeted cold email

This is slower to spin up, but it teaches you how to sell outside platforms. One campaign is enough.

**List**  
Pick one niche you understand. Examples: boutique fitness, dental, local lead gen agencies, niche ecom operators. Pull 100 to 300 leads with LinkedIn Sales Navigator and a basic enrichment tool. Or just get em from Apollo and Apify. easier to be honest and more relevant and updated info there.

**Offer**  
One problem, one promise, one simple outcome.  
“Missed leads from forms and chats? I’ll set up a flow that captures every inquiry, assigns it, and triggers a same day follow up. You get a live dashboard. Two days turnaround.”

**Email structure**

* Subject: outcome or pain. “Missed web leads” or “No show follow up”
* 1: “Saw you run a \[niche\] shop. Quick one.”
* 2: One sentence on the problem you fix.
* 3: One sentence on the result.
* 4: One liner credibility.
* 5: Soft ask with 2 times. “Worth a 12 minute screen share at 2 or 4 this week?”

Keep it human. No wall of features. Send, then followup twice over 7 days.

# Step 2: run a simple math model

Do not chase perfection. Chase volume with quality.

* Communities: 1 post a day, 3 to 5 comments a day, for 7 days. Expect 10 to 30 DMs across the week.
* Upwork: 3 to 5 boosted proposals a day, 7 days. Expect 5 to 12 replies if your Looms are specific.
* Cold email: 50 to 100 sends per day for 5 days. Expect 5 to 10 positive replies if the offer is clean.

That is enough conversations to close your first deal, often more than one.

# Step 3: run the call like an operator, not a hype man. And def not a sales man. Listen to their needs and problems before pitchign and closing.

You are not trying to “close.” You are trying to understand and prescribe. Exactly liek a doctor :-)

**Call checklist**

1. Frame: “To make this useful, I will ask a few questions to map your process, then I will sketch the exact flow and timeline.”
2. Why now: “What pushed you to fix this this week.”
3. Scope: “Where do leads start. Where do they go next. Who owns them.”
4. Impact: “What breaks today when this misses.”
5. Constraints: tools you must use, compliance, team capacity.
6. Budget and timing: “What have you allocated. What deadline matters.”
7. Prescription: draw the flow live. Confirm each step.
8. Next step: “I will send a one page scope, fixed price, with 50 percent deposit. If you want me to slot you this week, I can.”

You do not need a fancy demo. A sketch wins more trust than a slideshow.

# Step 4: proposals that move, not impress

Send it the same day. One page is fine.

**Sections**

* Problem in one sentence
* Outcome in one sentence
* Scope as a checklist
* Timeline with 2 milestones
* Price with deposit
* What you need from them to start
* Next step button or payment link

I use Stripe and a doc tool. You can send a PDF with an invoice link and it still works.

# Step 5: starter pricing that gets teh ball rolling and clients in your biz

You can raise after 3 to 5 wins. Get the wins first.

* Simple CRM setup with intake, pipeline, tasks, and 1 to 2 key automations: 1,200 to 1,800
* Lead capture and follow up flow, plus reporting tile: 1,500 to 2,000
* Light AI agent for routing or triage with a clear boundary: 1,500 to 2,500
* Full project ops build with dashboard and alerts: 2,500 to 3,500
* Anything mixed or ongoing: 40 to 60 per hour at the start

Always ask for 50 percent upfront on fixed price. The rest on sign off or when you hit the main milestone. Otherwise DO NOT ever work for free. Client might drop you and you lose your work. Always 50% upfront on fixed price. Or else, simply drop the client. Before starting. If you sense that a client is a ""retard"" most likely you are correct and they will end up leaving you a bad review anyways harming your profile a ton! Do not take those clients. You risk everyhitng.

**After delivery**  
Offer a small monthly plan for tweaks and monitoring. Even 300 to 800 a month across a few clients adds stability fast.

# Step 6: deliver like a pro (first impressions matter)

* Build in small slices. Ship something in the first 72 hours.
* Record a quick handoff Loom showing how to use it and where to click.
* Add a tiny dashboard or Slack alert so they feel the system working.
* Book a 2 week check-in before you finish the call. Lock the next step.

# Step 7: engineer reviews and referrals

Right after sign off:

“Can you close the project on your side and leave a quick written note about the outcome. It helps me keep working with teams like yours. I will send my review template if helpful.”

On platforms, the written part matters. Ask directly. You are not bothering them. You just made their life easier.

# The 10 day schedule

**Day 1**

* Build Upwork profile. Add two micro case studies, even if they are demo builds. Record your 90 second intro Loom.
* Draft cold email copy.
* Join 5 communities.

**Day 2 to Day 8**

* Communities: publish 1 post and write 3 to 5 comments each day. DM everyone who engages.
* Upwork: 3 to 5 boosted proposals with Looms each day.
* Cold email: send 50 to 100 with one thoughtful follow-up two days later.

**Day 9**

* Calls and proposals. Aim to send proposals same day.
* Deliver a tiny win for any quick jobs.

**Day 10**

* Close, collect deposits, schedule builds.
* Ask for the first review on any fast turnaround gig.

Stick to this and you will have conversations. Conversations turn into money if you keep the scope tight and the next step simple.

# Common mistakes that kill momentum

* Posting generic “value.” Show the steps. Add screenshots.
* Sending 10 copy paste Upwork bids with no Loom. You will be invisible.
* Pricing as if you had 20 case studies on day one. Reduce friction.
* Waiting a week to send the proposal. Send it same day.
* Letting a project end without asking for a written review. That review is your next sale.

# Tool stack I actually use

* [make.com](http://make.com/) or Zapier or N8n
* Loom for async video
* Stripe for invoices
* A simple doc tool for proposals
* LinkedIn Sales Navigator for a starter list
* One enrichment tool to fill emails

Use cheap or free where you can. You are buying speed, nobody cares about your software.

# Final notes

You do not need a brand. You do not need a website. You do not need to “get ready.” You need to talk to buyers where they already are, show them a clear path from pain to outcome, and make it easy to start.

Run the plan for 10 days. If you do the actions above, you will book calls. If you run the calls like an operator and send tight proposals the same day, you will close your first deal. Then raise prices and narrow your offer.

Hope that helped a little bit...

As always, I wish I had this starting 1 year ago.

Damnt...

Talk soon, more to come!

What follows is the same approach I give friends and past colleagues who are starting from zero. Cause yeah after you get on many covnersations and repeateadly mention you have a reatainer client that pays you $500 per month just for ya checkign a few parameters, then they all want to jump in hah.

# The rules for week one

1. Show up daily. If you cannot commit 60 to 90 minutes a day for 10 days, skip this post. Seriously. you got 0 clients right now. what are you doing with your time?
2. Spend a little. Budget $100 to $300 for tools or boosts. You are buying speed. It matters. but I dont have the money...damn man...sell stuff from your house...or go get a job so that you have that money and can actually break free right after from getting your first clients. come on. find solutions. dont buy your coffee daily from outside and cut the other expenses that do not help you and make em boosts for your proposals.
3. Lock your ego in the closet. And let it breathe there until you close your first client. Price at market starter rates, then raise later. Your first goal is wins, not margin. Trust me on this.

# Step 1: put yourself where buyers already hang out

You want three lines in the water at the same time. I run them in parallel. Cause as I said earlier, you got the time in your day to do this. 0 clients...so let's go.

# A) Agency communities

Your first buyers are usually marketing agencies. They need pipelines, CRMs, intake forms, lead routing, reporting, follow up, invoice triggers. They hate doing ops manually. You will be a gift. Or a tiny god.

Join 5 to 10 communities where agency owners talk about their daily struggles. Do not spam them with your offer. Think Facebook groups, Slack workspaces, Discords, small free communities. Ideal size is 500 to 2,000 members. Big enough to find leads. Small enough to be seen. Don't join those spammy communities with 500K members or more where admins just advertise stuff. they do not work.

**Daily schedule for 7 to 10 days**

* Post one helpful how-to that solves a common pain.
* Leave 3 to 5 thoughtful replies under other people’s threads.
* DM anyone who engages with your post or reply.
* DO NOT just spam your offer. you will get kicked out of the group.

**What to post**  
Keep it useful and short. Pick a problem and give the exact steps.

Examples you can adapt:

* “Client onboarding keeps slipping through cracks. Here’s a simple intake → CRM → task creation flow with [make.com](http://make.com/) that takes 30 minutes to set up.”
* “Lost leads in DMs. Quick way to turn every Facebook message into a CRM contact with assigned follow up.”
* “Agencies missing renewals. Add a pipeline stage timer and auto reminders so nothing ages out.”

**DM template**  
“Appreciate your comment on the CRM thread. If you share one bottleneck in your handoff or follow up, I can sketch the exact flow I’d set up. If you want to hash it live, I can hop on a 15 minute screen share today at 3 or 5.”

You are not pitching. You are diagnosing. That is what buyers want. And they do like it a lot. you will see.

# B) Platforms that already have intent

Upwork and Fiverr or other freelance platforms are not beneath you. They are you oxygen when you are new because the buyer already knows they have a problem and wants it solved.

**Upwork setup**

* Headline which names outcomes, not tools: “AI agents and automation systems for agencies” beats “Automation Expert.”
* Non-round rate like 74.60. It reads intentional.
* Top of profile: one paragraph of proof. One line per outcome or logo. Add 2 bullet point case studies with numbers.

**Application process**

* Apply to 3 to 5 jobs per day in Automation, Scripting, CRM, Operations. (tip, search for [make.com](http://make.com/) or N8N in your filters. makes it even more specific and laser focused)
* Boost each proposal by a little. You pay a dollar to get seen first. That dollar prints money if your pitch is tight. Closing a client for $500 and paying $2 to be seen is a good trade off.
* Every proposal starts with a short Loom. Three minutes. Your face and screen. Walk through their post in plain English: what they want, how you would build it, what the end state looks like. Do not send a 10 minute loom video...or even more than 4 mins. Re-shoot it. nobody will watch a 5 plus min loom video. none. so shoot it again! :-)

**Loom outline**

1. 10 seconds: “Saw your post about X. I build flows like this for agencies.”
2. 90 seconds: Show the exact flow. Boxes and arrows. “Form in, validation, tag by source, create deal, assign owner, follow up sequence, Slack alert, dashboard tile.”
3. 30 seconds: “Timeline and budget ballpark. I can start this week.”
4. 10 seconds: “If this looks right, I will send a clean proposal with scope and milestones.”

Text under the Loom is short. Two bullets of proof. One call to action to book.

**Fiverr**  
Create a simple gig for “make.com automation setup or n8n respectively” or “AI agent for lead capture” with three packages. Keep copy direct. Fiverr skews smaller, but small jobs turn into retainer cleanups if you respond fast.

# C) Targeted cold email

This is slower to spin up, but it teaches you how to sell outside platforms. One campaign is enough.

**List**  
Pick one niche you understand. Examples: boutique fitness, dental, local lead gen agencies, niche ecom operators. Pull 100 to 300 leads with LinkedIn Sales Navigator and a basic enrichment tool. Or just get em from Apollo and Apify. easier to be honest and more relevant and updated info there.

**Offer**  
One problem, one promise, one simple outcome.  
“Missed leads from forms and chats? I’ll set up a flow that captures every inquiry, assigns it, and triggers a same day follow up. You get a live dashboard. Two days turnaround.”

**Email structure**

* Subject: outcome or pain. “Missed web leads” or “No show follow up”
* 1: “Saw you run a \[niche\] shop. Quick one.”
* 2: One sentence on the problem you fix.
* 3: One sentence on the result.
* 4: One liner credibility.
* 5: Soft ask with 2 times. “Worth a 12 minute screen share at 2 or 4 this week?”

Keep it human. No wall of features. Send, then followup twice over 7 days.

# Step 2: run a simple math model

Do not chase perfection. Chase volume with quality.

* Communities: 1 post a day, 3 to 5 comments a day, for 7 days. Expect 10 to 30 DMs across the week.
* Upwork: 3 to 5 boosted proposals a day, 7 days. Expect 5 to 12 replies if your Looms are specific.
* Cold email: 50 to 100 sends per day for 5 days. Expect 5 to 10 positive replies if the offer is clean.

That is enough conversations to close your first deal, often more than one.

# Step 3: run the call like an operator, not a hype man. And def not a sales man. Listen to their needs and problems before pitchign and closing.

You are not trying to “close.” You are trying to understand and prescribe. Exactly liek a doctor :-)

**Call checklist**

1. Frame: “To make this useful, I will ask a few questions to map your process, then I will sketch the exact flow and timeline.”
2. Why now: “What pushed you to fix this this week.”
3. Scope: “Where do leads start. Where do they go next. Who owns them.”
4. Impact: “What breaks today when this misses.”
5. Constraints: tools you must use, compliance, team capacity.
6. Budget and timing: “What have you allocated. What deadline matters.”
7. Prescription: draw the flow live. Confirm each step.
8. Next step: “I will send a one page scope, fixed price, with 50 percent deposit. If you want me to slot you this week, I can.”

You do not need a fancy demo. A sketch wins more trust than a slideshow.

# Step 4: proposals that move, not impress

Send it the same day. One page is fine.

**Sections**

* Problem in one sentence
* Outcome in one sentence
* Scope as a checklist
* Timeline with 2 milestones
* Price with deposit
* What you need from them to start
* Next step button or payment link

I use Stripe and a doc tool. You can send a PDF with an invoice link and it still works.

# Step 5: starter pricing that gets teh ball rolling and clients in your biz

You can raise after 3 to 5 wins. Get the wins first.

* Simple CRM setup with intake, pipeline, tasks, and 1 to 2 key automations: 1,200 to 1,800
* Lead capture and follow up flow, plus reporting tile: 1,500 to 2,000
* Light AI agent for routing or triage with a clear boundary: 1,500 to 2,500
* Full project ops build with dashboard and alerts: 2,500 to 3,500
* Anything mixed or ongoing: 40 to 60 per hour at the start

Always ask for 50 percent upfront on fixed price. The rest on sign off or when you hit the main milestone. Otherwise DO NOT ever work for free. Client might drop you and you lose your work. Always 50% upfront on fixed price. Or else, simply drop the client. Before starting. If you sense that a client is a ""retard"" most likely you are correct and they will end up leaving you a bad review anyways harming your profile a ton! Do not take those clients. You risk everyhitng.

**After delivery**  
Offer a small monthly plan for tweaks and monitoring. Even 300 to 800 a month across a few clients adds stability fast.

# Step 6: deliver like a pro (first impressions matter)

* Build in small slices. Ship something in the first 72 hours.
* Record a quick handoff Loom showing how to use it and where to click.
* Add a tiny dashboard or Slack alert so they feel the system working.
* Book a 2 week check-in before you finish the call. Lock the next step.

# Step 7: engineer reviews and referrals

Right after sign off:

“Can you close the project on your side and leave a quick written note about the outcome. It helps me keep working with teams like yours. I will send my review template if helpful.”

On platforms, the written part matters. Ask directly. You are not bothering them. You just made their life easier.

# The 10 day schedule

**Day 1**

* Build Upwork profile. Add two micro case studies, even if they are demo builds. Record your 90 second intro Loom.
* Draft cold email copy.
* Join 5 communities.

**Day 2 to Day 8**

* Communities: publish 1 post and write 3 to 5 comments each day. DM everyone who engages.
* Upwork: 3 to 5 boosted proposals with Looms each day.
* Cold email: send 50 to 100 with one thoughtful follow-up two days later.

**Day 9**

* Calls and proposals. Aim to send proposals same day.
* Deliver a tiny win for any quick jobs.

**Day 10**

* Close, collect deposits, schedule builds.
* Ask for the first review on any fast turnaround gig.

Stick to this and you will have conversations. Conversations turn into money if you keep the scope tight and the next step simple.

# Common mistakes that kill momentum

* Posting generic “value.” Show the steps. Add screenshots.
* Sending 10 copy paste Upwork bids with no Loom. You will be invisible.
* Pricing as if you had 20 case studies on day one. Reduce friction.
* Waiting a week to send the proposal. Send it same day.
* Letting a project end without asking for a written review. That review is your next sale.

# Tool stack I actually use

* [make.com](http://make.com/) or Zapier or N8n
* Loom for async video
* Stripe for invoices
* A simple doc tool for proposals
* LinkedIn Sales Navigator for a starter list
* One enrichment tool to fill emails

Use cheap or free where you can. You are buying speed, nobody cares about your software.

# Final notes

You do not need a brand. You do not need a website. You do not need to “get ready.” You need to talk to buyers where they already are, show them a clear path from pain to outcome, and make it easy to start.

Run the plan for 10 days. If you do the actions above, you will book calls. If you run the calls like an operator and send tight proposals the same day, you will close your first deal. Then raise prices and narrow your offer.

Hope that helped a little bit...

As always, I wish I had this starting 1 year ago.

Damnt...

Talk soon, more to come!

1ntglan,https://i.redd.it/2xmv9pr4h3sf1.jpeg,"Two musicians, one room Setup - Need Gear Advice for Low-Volume Practice Space","Hey folks!



I’ve been working on a cozy jam/practice room where a friend and I can regularly play guitar and bass together. The space is already coming together nicely:



•  Two comfy rotating chairs and a rug to keep things chill

•  A coffee table with storage underneath (great for cables)

•  A wall full of guitars behind us

•  A 50"" TV in front that could double as a DAW screen

•  Speaker stands and an IKEA unit hiding gaming consoles and power bricks — cable clutter is under control



The idea is that my friend only needs to bring his bass and pedalboard. We want something to plug into and something to hear ourselves through — simple, clean, and fun.



We’re not aiming for pro recording, just a space to jam, practice, and maybe capture small ideas. No drummer (yet), but I’ve got a few directions in mind and would love your input:

**Option A: Traditional Amp Setup**



•  Small 15W guitar amp + 15–30W bass combo amp

•  Each amp on its own furniture piece

•  Simple, tactile, and easy — but no built-in drum track or looping options



**Option B: Direct-to-Interface Setup**



•  Run both pedalboards into my Audient Sono (2 inputs)

•  Use studio monitors instead of amps

•  Mac Mini + Ableton Live (I have a license) + MIDI controller for looping and drum tracks



My big question here:  

Can I replace my current Hi-Fi speakers with proper studio monitors and still use them for vinyl, movies, and gaming *as well as* DAW playback? Would love recommendations that balance music production and casual listening.

We’re leaning toward low-volume solutions, so Option B is tempting — but I’m open to hybrid ideas too.



Any gear suggestions, speaker recs, or clever setup tips are welcome. What would you add to make this jam space even better?

1ntgk1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1ntgk1f/does_waterdrop_wdrf10_filter_truly_deliver/,Does Waterdrop WD-RF10 Filter Truly Deliver Cleaner Water? In-Depth Review,"The Waterdrop WD-RF10, a replacement filter for under-sink water systems, caught my attention thanks to its promises of high capacity, impressive lead reduction, and ease of use. With claims of 11,000 gallons of water purification and compatibility with multiple Waterdrop under-sink systems (10UA, 10UA-UF, 10UB, and 10UB-UF), I was eager to see what it could do.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek, compact dimensions—3.6""x3.6""x10""—were a perfect fit under my standard kitchen sink. Its eco-friendly materials, ranging from BPA-free plastics to a natural coconut shell carbon block, reflect thoughtful engineering. I particularly appreciated the filtration accuracy of 0.01 microns, which targets even the smallest contaminants. It felt like a quality investment in every way, and installing it was smoother than I anticipated.

**Performance**

I’ve put this filter to the test daily in a household of four. Tap water previously carried a faint chlorine scent, which this filter tackled head-on. I wasn’t expecting just how crisp the water ended up tasting. From reducing lead by meeting NSF/ANSI 53 standards to minimizing chlorine as per NSF/ANSI 42, this little filter really delivered on its promises. It’s fantastic for improving the flavor of tea and coffee, which typically reveal any water quality flaws.

[Check Waterdrop WD-RF10 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08hv51x15/)

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**

Connecting the replacement filter was a straightforward task. I used it with a Waterdrop 10UA system, although it’s compatible with several other models. Swapping out the old filter for this one took less than 10 minutes—vastly simpler than some competing brands I’ve had experience with in the past. Unlike clunky filters I’ve used before, this one genuinely felt hassle-free during installation.

**Highlights**

- Ensures up to 11,000 gallons of service life with municipal water.  
- Reduces lead, chlorine, and bad taste, while filtering sediment and large particles.  
- Filters out bacteria larger than 0.01 microns with reliable accuracy.  

**Areas of Concern**

- While installation is generally easy, beginners might find the instructions sparse.  
- Depending on highly sedimented water types, some might notice reduced flow over time.  

**Alternative Offerings**

I’ve used an AquaPure system before, another well-regarded filter in the same category. In terms of taste improvement, I felt they were comparable, but the Waterdrop performed better on durability and compatibility. Some users might prefer the Brita Total360 series for its ease of sourcing parts and filters, though I found the Waterdrop more effective at lead reduction.

**Value for Money**

Considering the ongoing benefits of clean, lead-free water and a high-capacity filter lifespan, the price feels accessible for most households. By cutting the need for bottled water and reducing overall waste, this filter earns serious points for cost efficiency. I’d peg this as an excellent choice for budget-conscious families who aren’t willing to compromise on safety.

1ntgjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ntgjoe/confused_about_sex_with_gf_of_85_years_27_m_and/,confused about sex with gf of 8.5 years… 27 M and 26 F,"M 27 and F 26, we’ve been together since 2016. Our lives are just getting really started sort of. I have worked for 3 years about, and she just started working. She did a health care related program for 3 years. I had a career related reset this year too and have been building back up. I was the majority money maker and Spender in the relationship as she has divorced parents, the father doesn’t do or help with Jack shit, a compete piece of shit who bickers with his new wife all the time, has anger issues, and doesn’t seem to genuinely care about her finances and schooling since she was around 17-18. She lives with her single mother in a house that’s meant for 4-6 people to live. The house is a horror show, the mother has mental issues that she has never gone to therapy for, and clearly has depression and or trauma from her messy divorce, cheating ex husband, and her poor upbringing with 7 other siblings and her mother was divorced as well. My GF was practically raised by her grandmother because she lived with her and her mother from the time she was 3/4-14 while her mother worked as a cop. The house is also kinda a mess, outdated shit, ceilings have water marks and etc, no major work has been done, household needs have been avoided and go unfixed-or are half assed. My gf was guilted on her 19th birthday that the rug they so desperately needed for their living room because the old one was from the 90s, was her birthday present and that she would get nothing because she complained about how shitty and disgusting it was and was embarrassed to have friends over because of it. 

I was and still am there for her through everything, all the bullshit, all the unnecessary psychological warfare placed on her between her mom and dad who couldn’t properly co parent, the guilt tripping about money and using it against her when she needs/needed simple help and etc. I personally am the light in her life in terms of consistency with not treating her like shit, or being a problem in her life, despite obviously normal relationship issues over the years with some ups and downs, and hard battles with dealing with her fucked up family. My family provided her with resources and help selflessly when she needed it, she didn’t ask for help my father personally wanted to because he was raised to be a decent human being unlike her half assed selfish dad who didn’t wanna do shit for her or her older brother. I forgot to mention her Dad and Older brother both have lived in separate states too. 

Anyway, our relationship started so magically and we clicked from day zero and still pretty much do to this day, we built a strong foundation, I fortunately had 5000$ in savings when I met her from a small business me and my friends did in high school, so we were able to go out and do things with ease, no money problems. We started lil traditions our first 3 years together, we connected on some interests, on positivity about our future, we just have a strong connection/foundation that isn’t over bearing or too clingy, we have balance and etc. Like on a scale of 1-10 our relationship has been consistently a 9/10 until somewhere in 2024…

To summarize, the end of 2023 she lost her grandmother fast, it came out of no where. It was really hard for her and affected her schooling greatly that semester. Then 3 months later she got dropped by her “best friend” over something exceedingly stupid and not really worth losing a friend over. Then school got really hard, like the most important last 3 semesters were from spring 2024 to spring 2025 up until graduation and a big test after graduation.

We have been through losing friends together, all her family issues, some of mine, a great deal of our own relationship growth and etc. We are pretty hardened and battle tested in our relationship, but when school got harder I noticed the intimacy started to go down. We used to have sex like 3-4 times a week on average from 2018-2023. She also used to touch me a lot more, random hand jobs and blow jobs 5-6 times a month, I’d eat her out sometimes, 2 times a month, sex used to be a lot more adventurous but not in a wild way. We both can really get into it and try some new things but we aren’t too weird and wild with sex. We don’t and both don’t do any butt stuff, and nothing else that’s really weird. She’s been afraid to order any toys in fear of her mom opening her package… (which she does smfh). I also am really good with touching her and fingering her before sex making sure she feels good, and I’d say I finger her/ arouse her thoroughly before 85% of the time before sex. Also we don’t use protection we hate it, have been since 2019. 

Anyway, as her spring 2024 semester got harder I noticed we started to do less sex, and I understand completely that she was stressed with a lot of studying and etc. Like I said we’ve been through a lot. We are battle tested and I am very patient so to me it’s like OK we’ll get through this just like everything else. So id say we were averaging sex maybe 3-4 times a month, this is also when blow jobs and hand jobs started to stop. I would still try and eat her out but as she stopped the oral I started to give up because in my head I was getting confused and was thinking “ok you don’t wanna give me head then I’m not doing it til you get back into it”.
So summer comes and things got a lil better with less stress but again less handjobs and blow jobs, I mean they pretty much are non existent from spring 2024 to now (Fall 2025).
So Fall 2024 comes, it starts to happen again, more stress less sex, more school and studying less sex blah blah blah. I’d say we are averaging still 3-4 times a month with sex. Then spring 2025 comes… Jesus Christ it was horrendous. There was like 3-4 weeks of no sex which was a first. Like sometimes two weekends would go by and no sex. She also started to have a hard time getting wet and staying aroused, and she was confused about it. I’d say sex was at like an average of 2 times maybe 3 a month and the quality of sex just dipped. Again it was her hardest semester ever of school and leading up to graduation, a big test, and then getting into a program post graduation. We even discussed the sex issue a few times and every time it was “idk what’s going on from her end, or it’ll get better after school ends I’m constantly stressed and or worried about tests”. Completely understandable, I was obviously there for her and I wasn’t gonna let the sex issues define our relationship because I know this is more than that. I know sex and intimacy are important but they shouldn’t define or be a whole relationship and I just love her too much to be an asshole and make sex a huge problem and make her feel guilty about it. But this was/is affecting me, it’s greatly confusing. 

Anyway so next, summer comes, she passes all her stuff and secures a job that starts in September. So she’s got pretty much one last free summer before her career kicks off and I’m not normally scheduled so I’ve got a lot of free time during the week. So again things got a little better in the summer with sex but not that much better. We literally would have my or her house to ourselves for 8-9 hours and she didn’t wanna do shit… like during the day bored nothing to do happened very often this summer, like 1-2 days a week where we just hung out and would have space and time to our selves. She wouldn’t initiate, like it was fucking non existent. And sometimes I’d try to but she wasn’t in the mood, and now she’s not in the mood more so than ever before. Like this was never an issue before but it’s so confusing to me. We used to take advantage of free time to fuck so much and now we get 8 hours to ourselves and fucking nothing? Like idk what’s going on and now I’m spiraling thinking am I the issue? Did I do something? I mean I can literally fuck everyday still, I am energized, I want that close intimacy and connection with her, but we are losing it and I noticed our connection and flow is off, like 6.5/10 in terms of our overall relationship now when things have always been 8.5-9.5/10 for most the relationship.

I’m just lost here. I haven’t gotten a blow job or hand job this year at all…. We average sex like 2 times a month now. I am a considerate boyfriend who has no problem going out and covering things and just having a good time between eating, gymming together, going out to the bars, walks, running to stores with her, getting coffee and etc. I don’t expect much back but like yo…What is going on like she doesn’t even touch me as much in bed, or get arroused when I’m laying close into her, grinding a little against her, or touching her legs/back, it’s like she’s not taking any hints or not feeling anything like 95% of the time now. She’s like just not into it, I feel like she used to be into sexual tension and sexual touching and etc, like 85% of the tine we were together now it’s 10% of the time or something. I don’t get it I really don’t. It’s like healthcare and the schooling has killed her libido. Idek… I buy her flowers randomly, I do her favors, I always open doors for her, I’m not a piece of shit. 
Am I going crazy because  I’m only 27, it’s not like we’re fucking in our 40s and 50s with grown kids. And also our relationship is fine in terms of our goals together, our respect and care for each other and etc, it’s just this one part that isn’t making sense. Also she’s not the cheating type, she has literally came to me crying about going out with her friends and feeling guilty for talking to the DJs and having a good time because she never wants me to think that she’s even considering cheating. Since day 1 she’s hated cheaters because of her father and I vowed to her that I would never be like that or do that to her. She’s a very emotional girl who cares about her loved ones, she’s definitely not the cheating type. I just want to understand what’s happening because I’m starting to feel like I’m not good enough or something is wrong with me. And I’m going crazy in my head because I want that close intimate relationship in our sexual lives again, it’s extremely frustrating and I’m just sitting here taking it while I wait for something to just magically change because I’ve given night hints, and have been extremely understanding and patient.",2,1759148566.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

For context on my choices, I’m a big fan of not blaming or finding fault, and just doing better in the future. Blaming and fault finding doesn’t actually help and accountability can just be recognizing that you made a mistake and moving forward/doing better without punishment.

So to recap: my son who is autistic and has ADHD and an unspecified anxiety disorder that is likely PTSD, had his head pinned to a desk by the teacher. I emailed the principal who denied it happened, then insisted he could not wear his GPS watch because “wire tapping” despite my son being a significant elopement risk.

Things escalated after that. I filed it away and kept pushing for the school to do better. What instead happened was the principal and the Bad Behavior Specialist (separate from the good one) emailed between each other and strategized ways to trigger meltdowns in my kid and then suspend him. He attended maybe 60% of school days because he was constantly suspended. Of the days he was at school, 48% were spent in the office or outside of class instruction for “behavior issues.” By law, more then ten days of suspension *cumulative* require a manifestation  determination review, but the few meetings I had with admin I was just shut down, even when I brought an advocate. 

Last year, I realized that I was giving the school too many chances to do better and I got tired of being ignored by admin, after one of his teachers as punishment went into his backpack, removed some drawings he had done, and threw them in the trash and poured milk on them. It obviously triggered a meltdown and he was suspended. During the return to school meeting I told the admin staff and the teacher responsible that they are failing my son. They took offense. I got called two hours after leaving the meeting because he got suspended again.

At this point I emailed the superintendent and the director of elementary education. I told them conversations with admin weren’t going anywhere and provided them a list of incidents, explaining that these are the ones I have documentation on, but there were several others. I made it clear that I was fully aware of the legal issues and that I wanted to see genuine changes and a plan for moving forward or I would absolutely be filing a complaint with the Michigan department of civil rights, and the department of education. I left out that I had already spoken to a friend of mine who is a lawyer and referred me to an education lawyer who sat down with me about what laws were broken and what I should demand, and what my options were should this meeting not be productive. I had a plan.

A meeting was held. On the last PD day of school at the end of the year, the superintendent came down to the school and informed the staff that there would be a change in leadership.  The principal was let go. Not just transferred to a different school, but outright fired.

My son started middle school this year and we’re having a repeat. Not quite as egregious, but for example, he is very underweight and his meds impact his growth and appetite, as does a history of food insecurity and abuse related to food. As a result, his IEP has it that he is allowed a small snack in a non disruptive way if necessary. It outlines when it is necessary and what conditions need to be met in order to give him a snack I provide. The snacks I send are kept in a classroom and the teacher gives him either a meat stick or some cheese ritz and he is expected to eat them quietly while working. He does this.

The office confiscated the snacks and refused to return them to his teacher. When he naturally got upset (low blood sugar and well, autistic) and started crying, they gave him a detention. Part of his detention was that he would be the last one to go through the lunch line. He would have to wait til everyone else got lunch, and then he could get his. I got a call because he had run away from class and detention. When I spoke to him he was sobbing. I was at work (I nanny for kids with special needs) so I sent my foster mom to pick him up. She chewed out the admin.

They then informed her that he had a Saturday detention, but when asked why, they said they didn’t know and there was no documentation. At this point I was on the phone from work and told them he would not be attending Saturday detention without the proper documentation per state and federal law and district policy. They told me that he would then be suspended. I said the same applies, a suspension requires documentation, and if you can’t provide documentation, I will absolutely challenge it.

I then requested a formal meeting with admin and the special ed team. I plan on pushing that they read through his IEP and acknowledge the ways they fucked up, and put together a written plan to be included with his IEP on how they will prevent issues like this in the future. 

I’m low key worried that my own issues with his former principal are making me quicker to shut things down. I don’t want to be adversarial, but it was four years of abuse before I finally escalated things at his former school. I don’t know where the middle ground is. I want to acknowledge that education is a difficult career and that the school is constantly understaffed, but what even is the point of an IEP if they just outright ignore it? How much grace is enough and how much is too much?

I can’t afford to homeschool, but we do have an online school that is covered by the state. The issue with that option is that he would lose the free college he would otherwise get if he stayed in district school.

I’m so tired of fighting shit and I don’t want to spend the rest of my kid’s school life fighting everyone, but also like COME THE FUCK ON. I’m not asking for special treatment here, I’m asking them to educate my son without antagonizing him.

Y’all please tell me this fight is worth it, please tell me I’m not being a bully to educational staff here because I’m genuinely considering going forward with a lawsuit if this continues any further. 

Edit: fuck, I’m still coffee-ing and got side tracked. The former principal was fired for covering up the physical violence and also for failing to meet legal and district standards regarding manifestation determination, as well as for the abuse against my child. Apparently this was a pattern and there were seven complaints against her in the past but I’m the first parent to have thorough documentation and take it as far as I did. I have a reputation for being basically immovable, a brick wall, and when I let myself, which is rarely, I tend to push back hard. Apparently some of the staff who knew of me were waiting for me to reach my breaking point and push back. The former principal has apparently gone on a warpath against me and my kid and presented a version of events to other staff and former colleagues on her level, and so my lawyer thinks if things persist we have a strong, strong case for retaliation.",62,1759148387.0,breakingmom,30,0.96,False
