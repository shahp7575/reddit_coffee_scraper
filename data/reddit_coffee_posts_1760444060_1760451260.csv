After paying what I did for this thing, I'm annoyed.  My complaints are: the above issues, plus low clearance under PF, cannot descale at home, hard to see under the d\*\*\* thing (why put the dials there??), and no shot timer (really, at this price?).

‚ÄãIn a city perpetually veiled in rain and neon glow, a reserved young man and an artist are drawn together by quiet chance encounters in a local cafe, only to find their budding, silent love story threatened by her imminent, unavoidable departure to another country.
‚ÄãSynopsis (Detailed Scene & Plot Breakdown)
‚ÄãAct I: The Silent Connection
‚ÄãThe story opens in a moody, rain-soaked city, establishing a tone of ethereal urban melancholy. KAIZEN (late 20s, tall, introspective), dressed in a black trench coat, arrives at a quaint, old-world cafe. Inside, he first sees AURELIA (late 20s, shy, artistic), sketching by a window, bathed in the soft, flickering light of a sudden rumble of thunder. Their eyes meet in slow motion‚Äîa moment of instant, silent recognition‚Äîbut Aurelia quickly retreats into her sketchbook, establishing her introverted nature.
‚ÄãTheir first exchange is prompted by a mundane accident: the kindly old cafe owner spills coffee. Aurelia offers a tissue, leading to an awkward but meaningful first conversation about the rain, which Kaizen poetically calls the ""most fitting weather.""
‚ÄãThe act concludes with a crucial thematic beat: the two separate without exchanging names. The Voice Over states: ""Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting."" This establishes their relationship as one built purely on emotion, proximity, and shared silence, rather than conventional romance.

1o6ggju,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o6ggju/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk - Part 2,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/s/nH7HkIXyuc)

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that‚Äôs what made me think I saw what I did. That didn‚Äôt explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn‚Äôt it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn‚Äôt going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me‚Äù, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn‚Äôt been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYour drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?‚Äù he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

‚ÄúOh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.‚Äù

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There‚Äôs only one way to drink it and that‚Äôs ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn‚Äôt keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don‚Äôt bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, buddy.‚Äù He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent‚Äôs.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

‚ÄúDo you come here often?‚Äù she said with a faux twang accent.

‚ÄúI-uh‚Ä¶ reckon.‚Äù I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

‚ÄúLooks like we have the place all to ourselves,‚Äù she remarked with a grin.

‚ÄúTommy shouldn‚Äôt have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.‚Äù I quipped. 

She laughed. ‚ÄúPerfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.‚Äù

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to another summer in the books,‚Äù she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ‚ÄúSo are you local year round?‚Äù

I shook my head yes and clarified, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?‚Äù

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent‚Äôs and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven‚Äôt been on one for miles.

‚ÄúEnough about me, what are you up to?‚Äù A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure somethings out. It‚Äôs been a very long couple of years.‚Äù

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

I shook it off. ‚ÄúNot particularly, it‚Äôll pass. Just a matter of time.‚Äù

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

‚ÄúHey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre‚Äôs, actually. We have one just like it.‚Äù

She looked down and declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hilarious, that‚Äôs where I stole this from!‚Äù

We both laughed.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúThe staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.‚Äù

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ‚ÄúThese Eyes‚Äù by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ‚ÄúThe Stones are my dad‚Äôs favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.‚Äù 

I liked that, it fit her.

‚ÄúMy dad loved them too,‚Äù I concurred. ‚ÄúHe took me to see them when I was a kid.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúSounds like a great dad to me.‚Äù

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she‚Äôd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she inquired.

‚ÄúYeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.‚Äù

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would‚Äôve seen it, right? Unless‚Ä¶ did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre‚Äôs.‚Äù

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn‚Äôt care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick‚Äôs. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.‚Äù

Angie smiled wide. ‚ÄúI love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?‚Äù

There was a pause. I didn‚Äôt know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn‚Äôt feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she‚Äôs good I‚Äôll grab a slice for her this weekend.‚Äù

That was the best I could do. It was better than ‚ÄúRun as fast as you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need me to walk you home?‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It‚Äôs their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.‚Äù

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ‚ÄúI can wait here with her, I‚Äôm still cleaning up. I‚Äôll see you tomorrow night.‚Äù

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ‚ÄúYou never told me your name!‚Äù

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick‚Äôs bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong‚Äôs scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn‚Äôt stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

1o6gfs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o6gfs4/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk - Part 1,"
If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it‚Äôs hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We‚Äôre barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it‚Äôs already a ghost town. That‚Äôs where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

‚ÄúSpectre‚Äôs: Records & Rarities‚Äù; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to name a single song off the album they‚Äôre donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I‚Äôd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I‚Äôm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight‚Äôs choice: ‚ÄúSecret Treaties‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper‚Äù ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70‚Äôs. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúCareer of Evil‚Äù blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn‚Äôt have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ‚ÄúHarvester of Eyes‚Äù certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn‚Äôt care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn‚Äôt have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ‚ÄúPlan 9 From Outer Space‚Äù poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody‚Äôs grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it‚Äôs so full of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that‚Äôs why I never left. If I don‚Äôt visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn‚Äôt want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent‚Äôs Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

‚ÄúOh my god! You scared me!‚Äù she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.‚Äù

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúSure, sure. Three bucks.‚Äù

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ‚ÄúSo, any plans tonight?‚Äù

I thought about it, and I really didn‚Äôt have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick‚Äôs for a drink or two until I‚Äôve had enough to put me to sleep.

‚ÄúI was going to head over to Mick‚Äôs, maybe catch the game for a bit.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúI know Mick‚Äôs ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I‚Äôll stop by. There isn‚Äôt much else to do on a night like tonight.‚Äù

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

‚ÄúHey bud, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúHey Mac, long time.‚Äù

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been dead out here, huh?‚Äù

Without looking up, he lamented, ‚ÄúSure has. It‚Äôs that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.‚Äù

Puzzled, I pressed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ‚ÄúI need to get some help. I‚Äôm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.‚Äù

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, man! I‚Äôd give you a ride myself if I had a car.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI just need to see her again.‚Äù

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and‚Ä¶ everything just started falling apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready. Tonight‚Äôs my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.‚Äù

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn‚Äôt know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ‚ÄúVincent‚Äôs was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I‚Äôll see you, I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.‚Äù

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ‚ÄúI really think what you‚Äôre doing is great. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you.‚Äù

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you again, but I really hope it‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs your real name, by the way? Maybe I‚Äôll look you up someday to see how you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

Without turning fully around, he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick‚Äôs resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick‚Äôs served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick‚Äôs was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick‚Äôs was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp‚Äôs nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn‚Äôt a wasp‚Äôs nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was‚Ä¶ breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn‚Äôt very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn‚Äôt help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o6gc43,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1o6gc43/proportional_income_splitting_difficulties_doctor/,Proportional Income splitting difficulties - doctor,"Looking for advice on splitting expenses proportionally according to income. Until recently we both put the same amount into a joint account and basically all shared costs come out of it. He earned a bit more than me, but had little in the way of savings so I wanted him to build up an emergency fund which he now has.

A few months ago he started earning significantly more, about 1.6x what I make and we agree that we should split things according to income. 

We are married and own a house together, so this is more about ensuring we both have a fair split of disposable income, can both build up savings and both have a decent retirement income.

The difficulty here is, he's a doctor whilst I work from home. So he has to run a car to get to work, has to pay for exams, buys food and coffees at work which adds up a lot over a year, has to pay for insurance and all these other fees that are required to work. He also has a   very solid pension compared to mine (employer only contributes the minimum), so I'd like to be able to put more into my pension as at the moment my projections come up short of a livable income in retirement.

I don't feel that it is fair to just split our take home proportionally as he has costs that I do not that come from his type of work compared to mine. Ideally I would subtract these costs from his base take home pay, then he would pay 50% of this into a joint account and I would pay 50% of my take home pay. 

Does this seem right? Any advice on how best to do proportional split when one person has additional expenses as a result of their job type, or how to take into consideration pension quality when deciding on a split?

FYI we went to the same highschool but never talked to each other before, and then now in college he started talking to me and showed interest for the first time. And I did set my boundaries from the start as I told him that I dont do hook ups and I dont want to be involved in a weird stage where all we do is make out and cuddle. And that was two days ago, where he told me that he will put that in mind.

And last night, he ended things with me saying that he just doesnt have time for anything even casual with anyone, and that he still likes me but he just ""cant"" hang out. He wish he can, but he said he needs to commit to his schoolwork and sports (he is an athlete) and prioritize those two. He repeatedly told me that this wasnt anything personal, and that he can promise me that it wouldve been the same with anyone else. He also told me that when he says that he is locking in, it means that there are no girls in general period. He did wish that things were a bit different and college was easier than he thought so that he can have fun. He also told me that he still wants to talk to me occasionally, if that means grabbing a coffee or seeing each other during his frat party etc (which he also doesnt like that much of). 

I trust him with saying that he is struggling to be better in both of his sports and academics, since he did seem very deep in thought regarding grades and his future career etc, and that he is not a type of person who would be playing two girls. But it just feels like he is scared of failing or that there was a big factor (like his coach or his parents) who made him realize that he is not in a good spot recently, because it was just fine until today. 

Will that change at all when he starts to get into a routine and rhythm? It just feels like he is overwhelmed by the transitioning from highschool to college, and once he gets used to it, it will be fine",2,1760450438.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

In a city perpetually veiled in rain and neon glow, a reserved young man and an artist are drawn together by quiet chance encounters in a local cafe, only to find their budding, silent love story threatened by her imminent, unavoidable departure to another country.
Synopsis (Detailed Scene & Plot Breakdown)
Act I: The Silent Connection
The story opens in a moody, rain-soaked city, establishing a tone of ethereal urban melancholy. KAIZEN (late 20s, tall, introspective), dressed in a black trench coat, arrives at a quaint, old-world cafe. Inside, he first sees AURELIA (late 20s, shy, artistic), sketching by a window, bathed in the soft, flickering light of a sudden rumble of thunder. Their eyes meet in slow motion‚Äîa moment of instant, silent recognition‚Äîbut Aurelia quickly retreats into her sketchbook, establishing her introverted nature.
Their first exchange is prompted by a mundane accident: the kindly old cafe owner spills coffee. Aurelia offers a tissue, leading to an awkward but meaningful first conversation about the rain, which Kaizen poetically calls the ""most fitting weather.""
The act concludes with a crucial thematic beat: the two separate without exchanging names. The Voice Over states: ""Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting."" This establishes their relationship as one built purely on emotion, proximity, and shared silence, rather than conventional romance.

1o6gahx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6gahx,Is Monteverde Broad nib unit any good?,"Hello Everyone, A fountain pen noob here.

To give a bit of context, 

I got myself a Monteverde Ritma Walnut with Omniflex nib as a good real pen after using some chinese ones as an intro. Yes, Yes, Now that I know what I know, The irony isn't lost on me.

After reading and watching many poor opinions of omniflex on youtube, I still went ahead and got myself the omniflex for the looks of the nib and not really wanting the flex.

But, I didn't expect the other issues:
1. The tines splayed really quickly. After watching Pen Goulets omniflex troubleshooting video on omnifles, I came to know this is a pretty common issue on omniflex.
2. Also the pen was not feeding properly. No hard starts, It starts very wet and gushes ink but there was skipping in the downward strokes and after a while the nib would eventually run dry. Then after a while of resting it would be okay.

This feed issues may also be attributed to my ink choice, KWZ It smells like coffee to pair with the Walnut body and my like for coffee. I'm not sure if it isn't fluid enough for the feed and not feeding well.

I'm looking for a nib unit swap. I initially thought it was a jowo unit and replacement would be easy in my part of the world.
But, on further research I realized, monteverde uses their own housing for nib unit and the feed is the same as the chinese pens with no standard replacement available. ( The irony part. ) The official nib units are not for sale in my country.

But, I found that the Moonman Q1 I had unused has the same feed as the Ritma. So I tested it with the fine nib in Q1 and it has been writing okay till now.

But, I'm not satisfied with this franken pen arrangement as mainly
- It's a frankenpen with Gold plated nib from Q1 instead of the Black plated OG nib.
- The fine nib writes well but is not putting down much of the scented ink.

As I have a friend visiting from CA, I was thinking of getting the Monteverde Broad nib unit through them. I will get the Monte Verde logo and my pen wouldn't be a franken pen. My assumption is that since it is a JoWo Nib it should work fine unlike the Omniflex one. But the single review in the Amazon CA site mentioning hard starts and skipping makes me apprehensive.

https://www.amazon.ca/MONTEVERDE-JoWo-Stainless-Steel-Black/dp/B0CJH9378H

So, my question is for people who have had experience with the Monteverde broad nib.

1. How is it? 
2. Do you face any hard starts or skipping with it?
3. Is the plastic feed on these pens inherently bad that it can't supply enough ink for omniflex/broad nibs?
4. Do you think these nibs/feeds are temperamental of ink choice?
5. Am I better off sticking with a cheap black plated #6 nib available locally keeping it a frankenpen?",1,1760450377.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

1o6g69b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1o6g69b/explore_bellaluce_laundry_detergent_sheets_for/,Explore Bellaluce Laundry Detergent Sheets for Eco Cleaning,"Laundry can always be a tedious routine, but the Bellaluce B0DZCPRRBH laundry detergent sheets bring a unique twist to this chore. As someone who has tested my share of cleaning products over the years, I was genuinely intrigued by the claims of eco-friendliness, convenience, and powerful stain removal wrapped into these compact sheets. They promised a lot, and I was eager to see if they could live up to the hype in my household.

**Convenient Design for Daily Use**  
The design of these laundry sheets is nothing but a win for those combating cluttered spaces. Each sheet is ultra-thin and packaged in recyclable cardboard, eliminating chunky plastic detergent containers altogether. It felt like a breath of fresh air to open my cabinet and not wrestle with oversized jugs of liquid detergent. I also appreciated how lightweight the box was‚Äîperfect for carrying between rooms or taking along for trips. The pre-measured aspect‚Äîthat one sheet equals two loads‚Äîfelt oddly satisfying, cutting down the guesswork that usually comes with measuring liquid detergent.

[Check Bellaluce B0DZCPRRBH price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0dzcprrbh/)

**Powerful Cleaning Performance**  
Despite the small size of these sheets, their cleaning power genuinely surprised me. Whether it was grease stains from dinner, coffee spills, or the inevitable sweat marks on gym clothes, these sheets tackled it all effectively. I ran them through hot and cold wash cycles, and the results were consistent‚Äîthey dissolved quickly and left no residue. The fresh linen scent was subtle but pleasant, leaving clothes feeling clean but not overly perfumed. My skin can sometimes be sensitive, but using these sheets didn‚Äôt trigger any irritation, which was a relief.

**Eco-Friendly Credentials**  
This product shines brightly when it comes to sustainability. It‚Äôs thrilling to see a product that‚Äôs completely plastic-free while also keeping parabens, phosphates, and dyes out of the equation. Knowing these sheets are biodegradable gave me peace of mind, especially since traditional detergents contribute so much to plastic waste. The environmental impact is minimal with this product, and that feeling of contributing less harm to the planet is certainly a bonus in my book.

**Practicality for the Family**  
For larger households like mine, the bulk packaging of 400 loads is its standout feature. It essentially replaces multiple jugs of liquid detergent, offering a cost-effective and storage-efficient solution. The space-saving advantage can‚Äôt be overstated‚Äîno more wasted space in the laundry room! With kids constantly soiling their clothes during playtime, the sheer volume of detergent on hand meant I didn‚Äôt have to constantly restock.

**Highlights**  
- Quick-dissolving sheets work effectively in both hot and cold water.  
- Plastic-free and biodegradable packaging aligns with eco-friendly values.  
- Compact and easy-to-store design saves space in tight laundry setups.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite my positive experience, a few aspects could use some tweaking.  
- The fresh linen scent, while pleasant, might feel too mild for those who prefer stronger fragrances.  
- While advertised as hypoallergenic, individuals with severe sensitivities might still want to test it cautiously.   
- Thin sheets are convenient, but separating them from one another in humid settings can occasionally be tricky.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking these detergent sheets up against traditional liquid detergents or pods, their compact size and space-saving nature instantly make them more appealing for small apartments or dorms. Competing brands like Tru Earth focus similarly on eco-friendliness but sometimes offer fewer load counts per pack, making this a better long-term option for heavy users. However, some of those competitors might have an edge by offering stronger scents or wider availability in physical stores, whereas Bellaluce seems more niche-focused.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
From a value standpoint, the product delivers a commendable balance of quality and affordability. The sheer number of loads in one pack saves a significant amount compared to traditional brands. If eco-consciousness and practicality matter to you, the investment feels justifiable. Laundry became simpler and more efficient, saving me both time and future trips to the store for refills.

We‚Äôve been through this before, many times already, that it has become a cycle. We talk, we reach an understanding, we try (and I can see when he tries), but it just goes back to this default of ‚Äúlife happening‚Äù to us, which, most often than not, leaves me feeling like I‚Äôm living with a roommate than a partner.

We both work a lot, but his job is more demanding. And I try to support him in any way I could. I listen to his rants about his job, I get him coffee and lunch (since we both work at the same building), sometimes I‚Äôd proofread his work for him. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel reciprocated.

Now that I think about it, he rarely ever asks me if I‚Äôve already eaten unless it‚Äôs because he hasn‚Äôt eaten himself and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to eat alone. He‚Äôs been to my workstation once (and only because I couldn‚Äôt pickup my phone when he called), while I‚Äôve visited his so many times to deliver coffee or food even without being asked (because I know he forgets to eat when he‚Äôs already consumed with work). At home he rarely asks about my day and when he does, it feels perfunctory, and he barely listens to what I say.

He‚Äôs never planned any of our dates. He would ask me out, yes. He would be the one to pay more times than I am, yes. But pick the location? The activity? The food? He says it‚Äôs up to me, even when he‚Äôs the one who asked to go out. If I don‚Äôt come up with anything, he‚Äôll just take me shopping, which he knows I don‚Äôt particularly like unless I‚Äôm actually in need of something.

Like I said, I‚Äôve communicated all of these issues before. And I‚Äôve seen him try, and maybe there were a few times that felt like we were really partners. But it just goes back to the default. And I‚Äôm tired of communicating and repeating the cycle. But not doing anything feels like something in me is slowly dying.",5,1760450089.0,emotionalintelligence,7,0.86,False

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of titans‚Äîor rather, a clash of *one titan and a very determined snack pack*. Portugal, the nine-point behemoth of Group F, faces Hungary, the four-point underdog with a knack for showing up to the party but forgetting the punchline. The odds? Portugal is a near-lock at **-880** (implied probability: 89.3%) on BetRivers, while Hungary‚Äôs long shot odds of **+1200** (implied: 7.7%) suggest bookmakers would take a vacation to Telki, Hungary, just to avoid witnessing a shock. The draw? A modest 6.5 (15.4%), because even the most optimistic Hungarian fan knows this: **Portugal doesn‚Äôt do draws. They do ‚Äúwe win, you cry.‚Äù**

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Portugal‚Äôs Price Tag Is Cheaper Than a Lisbon Coffee

Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers. Portugal‚Äôs -1.17 to -1.23 decimal odds (depending on the bookie) mean they‚Äôre about as likely to win this game as you are to resist eating the last croissant at a bakery. Their implied probability hovers between **85-89%**, which in sports terms is ‚Äúwe‚Äôre confident, but we‚Äôll still sell you insurance just in case.‚Äù Hungary‚Äôs +12.0 to +13.0 odds? That‚Äôs the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúBet on Hungary if you enjoy throwing money into the Atlantic Ocean and calling it ‚Äòart.‚Äô‚Äù

The over/under is set at **3.5 goals**, with ‚Äúunder‚Äù at 1.68 and ‚Äúover‚Äù at 2.08. Given Portugal‚Äôs clinical attack (they‚Äôve scored 12 goals in Group F) and Hungary‚Äôs leaky defense (conceding 6), this suggests bookmakers expect a **3-1 drubbing**‚Äîor maybe a 2-1 scoreline where Portugal‚Äôs coach yells, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it? You call *this* a comeback?‚Äù

### Digest the News: Vitinha‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll-Out Effort‚Äù vs. Hungary‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll-Out Confusion‚Äù

Portugal‚Äôs star man, Vitinha, has vowed an ‚Äúall-out effort‚Äù to secure early qualification.

And most marketing completely misses this.,"Unpopular opinion, maybe but I think this is where most small businesses get stuck.

People don‚Äôt buy products. They buy to fulfill emotional needs.
Logic justifies the purchase later. But emotion triggers it.

Think about it: we‚Äôve all chosen something we just liked more in the moment, even when the specs or comparison chart said we should go with something else.

A $6 latte isn‚Äôt coffee. It‚Äôs comfort. It‚Äôs routine. It‚Äôs a small moment in your day that actually feels like yours. (The actual product - coffee - is available at home for like 50 cents.)

Premium yoga apparel isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúmoisture-wicking fabric.‚Äù It‚Äôs feeling like you belong in that hot yoga class. It‚Äôs confidence.

A website redesign isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmodern UI/UX.‚Äù It‚Äôs finally looking legit instead of DIY. It‚Äôs not feeling embarrassed to send people your link.

If your marketing only talks about features - what you do, how you do it, the quality - you‚Äôre missing the entire reason people say yes.

And honestly, this is where I see most businesses leaving growth on the table.
I‚Äôve been working in marketing for 10 years, and whether I‚Äôm doing product launches for larger companies or just texting with friends who run small businesses, this is the pattern I see over and over.

People focus on what they‚Äôre selling. But they skip the why someone would actually buy it.
This is one of the core pieces I‚Äôm building into a framework I‚Äôm launching this week - the IDEA Loop. It‚Äôs designed to help entrepreneurs and small business owners get clarity on what they‚Äôre selling, who needs it, why they actually buy, and how to communicate that.

My days are long, and there‚Äôs usually too much to do, so at some point I just decided I gotta start waking up early. Like 5AM, sometimes 4:30 if I somehow sleep early lol.

At the start (like the first week), the only thing that really worked was just being stubborn. I had a reason (or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù I guess) and I just kept reminding myself of it. Even on days I slept late, I‚Äôd still wake up. I don‚Äôt really nap during the day either, it kinda helps me fall asleep early later. After maybe 1‚Äì2 weeks I got used to it and started sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours and still waking up around 5am. (definitely think 7-8 hrs is important though).

Still, some mornings I feel lazy or sleepy even if I slept fine. Happens.  
Some random things that helped me a bit:

* I do a short workout right after waking up. Also sunlight helps a lot (idk how but it does).
* Coffee around 10‚Äì11am hits better than early morning for me.
* If I‚Äôm dead tired I take like a 20‚Äì25 min nap.
* I do the ‚Äúboring/hard‚Äù work first, so later when I‚Äôm tired, I just do easy stuff.

I also joined a couple of small online groups for accountability ‚Äî one for waking up early, one for getting stuff done. Helps when you‚Äôre not the only one doing it.

And yeah some days I just don‚Äôt feel like it. I sleep in, or skip. It‚Äôs fine. The main thing is just not letting that become your new normal.

It wasn‚Äôt loud. It wasn‚Äôt rhythmic. It wasn‚Äôt even particularly alarming. But it was definitely there‚Äîa faint, inconsistent clicking sound that echoed just enough to get under your skin, like a whisper with bad timing.

It came from somewhere along the starboard conduit path, near the aft coolant junction. Maybe.

Maybe not.

Ensign Maeve Holloway tilted her head, listening, then frowned and tapped her boot against the bulkhead. The noise stopped. Then, a few seconds later, it resumed‚Äîslightly faster. Definitely smugger.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she muttered, ‚Äúyou wanna play it that way.‚Äù

She pulled out a small diagnostics slate from her toolbelt, flipped it on, and gave it five seconds to disappoint her. The results were predictably unhelpful: ‚ÄúSystem Stable. Minor Acoustic Deviation Detected. Risk: Negligible.‚Äù

She sighed and opened a voice channel to the ship‚Äôs AI.

‚ÄúCaretaker-9, did you get that?‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirmed,‚Äù replied the ship‚Äôs voice‚Äîsmooth, calm, and eternally polite in the way only something programmed to be patient could be. ‚ÄúAural anomaly logged at starboard conduit interface node B-12. Risk profile: Low. Classification: Psychological.‚Äù

Maeve blinked. ‚ÄúSorry, did you just say psychological?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Based on profile history, your auditory pattern recognition tends toward anomaly over-reporting during low-stimulation periods. Correlation exceeds 87 percent.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fancy way of saying ‚Äòyou‚Äôre bored and hearing things.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative.‚Äù

Maeve considered kicking the conduit. Instead, she narrowed her eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong. That rattle‚Äôs got character.‚Äù

Then she walked off in the direction of the noise.

The rest of the crew barely noticed. The Merciful Abandon wasn‚Äôt large, but it was old enough to have grown strange. Maintenance corridors didn‚Äôt quite match the deck plans. Vents echoed in odd directions. Sometimes, doors hissed open for no reason at all. The crew had learned to work around the weirdness, which was precisely why Maeve fit in so well.

She was good with strange systems. Terran-born, maybe mid-thirties in Earth years, with a bad habit of vanishing for hours and reappearing covered in dust and holding things the ship shouldn‚Äôt have had in the first place. Last time it had been a backup power cell no one knew existed and a perfectly preserved snack bar with a best-by date from 2094. She claimed she found both ‚Äújust poking around.‚Äù

So when Maeve failed to show up for post-lunch system checks, no one thought much of it.

Chief Engineer Hollik assumed she was asleep in the storage crawl again and made a note to shout at her later.

Bridge Officer Telen figured she‚Äôd gotten distracted rebuilding the inertial buffer stabilizers again‚Äîthe last time she did that, she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù increased jump precision by 4%, then claimed it was because she was bored and curious about symmetry.

And Captain Vren simply checked the logs, saw no emergencies, and made a quiet noise of resignation before muttering, ‚ÄúNot again.‚Äù

Caretaker-9 ran a crew ping, and when Maeve failed to answer, added a new line to the internal log:

""Status: Unaccounted. Last known location: Maintenance corridor C-12. Probable activity: unauthorized engineering.""

Three hours passed.

Then, without warning or reason, the following things occurred in quick succession:

The reactor's coolant flow, which had been running slightly hot for two weeks, rebalanced without adjustment.

A long-standing magnetic jitter in the forward cargo lock‚Äîpreviously filed under ‚Äújust don‚Äôt touch it‚Äù‚Äîvanished.

The backup life support monitor, which had been flashing ERROR 319b intermittently since the last retrofit, quietly stopped flashing.

Chief Hollik frowned at the diagnostics panel, tapped it, waited, then checked again.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù he said aloud.

From behind him, someone muttered, ‚ÄúMaybe she fixed it from inside the wall.‚Äù

The crew laughed.

Then something inside Deck C made a clonk noise‚Äîsharp and hollow, like someone dropping a wrench into an empty drum‚Äîfollowed by a quiet muffled curse and then a soft, slightly off-key hum that sounded suspiciously like a Terran pop song from a century ago.

There was a brief flicker in the power grid. The lights dimmed. A pump whined. Then everything settled again, smoother than before.

The bridge fell silent.

Caretaker-9 reported:

‚ÄúUnscheduled systems stabilization complete. No anomalies detected.
One human engineer remains unaccounted for.‚Äù

Captain Vren closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in the walls again.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbability exceeds 93 percent,‚Äù the AI replied. ‚ÄúRequesting permission to initiate internal comm sweep.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Vren said flatly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll come out when she‚Äôs done or hungry. Probably both.‚Äù

Caretaker-9 hesitated. ‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù

An hour later, Maeve Holloway emerged from an access hatch halfway up the bulkhead in Corridor D-3, covered in dust, lightly smeared with sealant, and dragging a small tool pouch in one hand and a mismatched collection of parts in the other.

Among them: three replacement fuses, a spoon bent into a weird spiral, and a loose bolt she held up for inspection before saying, to no one in particular, ‚ÄúThis one was the loud one.‚Äù

Ensign Telen, who happened to be walking past with a diagnostics slate, froze.

‚ÄúMaeve?‚Äù

She blinked at him. ‚ÄúOh hey. You‚Äôre on the early shift?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 1800 hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Huh.‚Äù She looked at the spoon. ‚ÄúTime flies.‚Äù

He stared. ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúInside. Following the rattle. Also, your coolant line was sulking.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù

Maeve gestured vaguely. ‚ÄúIt just needed coaxing. And a tap. And maybe rerouting three loops through the auxiliary manifold.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you file a maintenance override?‚Äù

She looked offended. ‚ÄúNo, I fixed it.‚Äù

Caretaker-9 chimed in from a wall speaker:

‚ÄúConfirmation: coolant flow has stabilized. Subsystems optimal. Auxiliary loop functioning within safe tolerances. Human engineer bypassed sixteen system locks to achieve results.‚Äù

Maeve grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs low for me.‚Äù

The captain was informed. The log was updated. The crew sighed.

Maeve went to the galley, ordered a sandwich, and requested extra napkins ‚Äúin case anything else needed adjusting.‚Äù

No one asked what the spoon had been for.


The audit wasn‚Äôt scheduled. No one asked for it. No one wanted it. But after the Merciful Abandon submitted three consecutive systems reports showing performance 11.4% above fleet average‚Äîand one that included the phrase ‚ÄúCoolant flow is vibing‚Äù‚Äîa flag tripped in Central Maintenance Analytics.

Fleet Compliance doesn‚Äôt like outliers. Especially when they‚Äôre good.

An auditor was dispatched.

By then, of course, the ship had already adjusted. The crew didn‚Äôt bother looking for Maeve Holloway anymore. She still appeared‚Äîsporadically, often covered in dust, once holding a coil of wire that apparently ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt part of anything but looked lonely‚Äù‚Äîbut her absences were no longer tracked.

Captain Vren had learned to stop asking.

The incident following the ‚Äúrattle resolution‚Äù had already broken enough protocols to qualify for commendation, punishment, or promotion, depending on which department was reviewing it. Maeve had declined to submit any kind of post-maintenance log. When pressed, she replied:

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt write anything down. Didn‚Äôt need to. It worked.‚Äù

That was the entire statement. It was added to the official engineering record under ""Noncompliant Feedback (Outcome: Positive).""

Caretaker-9, the ship‚Äôs AI, updated its personnel file accordingly:

Name: Holloway, Maeve
Position: Systems Engineer
Behavioral Tag: Unsupervised Maintenance ‚Äì Successful
Additional Classification: Uncontrollable Variable ‚Äì Do Not Lose

The AI also began logging minor systems fluctuations with the prefix:
[PHE] ‚Äì Possible Holloway Effect

Two days after the coolant fix, just as the crew was preparing for an orbital transfer, Caretaker-9 chimed into the bridge with its now-familiar blend of calm professionalism and quiet concern:

‚ÄúWarning: The engineer is missing again.‚Äù

No one reacted immediately.

Lieutenant Telen glanced up from his console, shrugged, and went back to adjusting jump parameters.

Chief Hollik raised an eyebrow and asked, ‚ÄúMissing or missing-in-the-wall?‚Äù

There was a short pause before the AI responded:

‚ÄúLocation uncertain. Movement pattern matches prior ‚Äòinfrastructure wandering.‚Äô Also, internal music sensors detect faint humming in maintenance shaft 3B.‚Äù

The captain sighed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll turn up. Check the coffee machine.‚Äù

They did. It was working again.

This was significant because it had been broken for three years. Not catastrophically‚Äîjust annoyingly. Every third cup tasted like warm printer ink. No one could fix it. Tech support had declared the issue ‚Äúspiritually unresolved.‚Äù

Now the brew was smooth, the heating consistent, and the error message had been replaced by a hand-written label reading:
‚ÄúSING TO IT. DON‚ÄôT ASK.‚Äù

It worked.

The crew, having learned the pattern, responded to Maeve‚Äôs disappearances with an increasingly blas√© routine. Conversations paused when odd vibrations passed through the floor. People cleared out of corridors when flickering lights synchronized. If someone heard soft, off-key humming in the vents, they simply nodded and said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in a mood.‚Äù

One afternoon during a course adjustment burn, the ship‚Äôs primary reactor alignment suddenly corrected itself mid-jump, resulting in a smoother arc and a 2.3% reduction in heat stress across the forward housing.

No one touched anything.

Lieutenant Telen, without looking up, raised a coffee mug and said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still in there.‚Äù

At that moment, Maeve was somewhere between the structural bulkhead and a heat exchange manifold, chewing on a protein bar and adjusting a resonance coupler with a wrench she‚Äôd named Susan. She didn‚Äôt remember where she‚Äôd gotten the wrench. Possibly a supply room. Possibly another ship. Possibly she‚Äôd made it. That part didn‚Äôt matter.

What mattered was that things worked.

By the time the Fleet auditor arrived‚Äîstiff uniform, clean boots, datapad in hand‚Äîthe ship was humming in the quiet, efficient way of something both well-maintained and slightly haunted.

Auditor Kels Revane was not impressed.

He toured the ship‚Äôs systems, checked diagnostics, and read through performance logs that had been annotated with phrases like ‚Äúthis shouldn‚Äôt be possible‚Äù and ‚Äúwe stopped questioning it after the lights stopped blinking Morse.‚Äù

He interviewed the crew. They were polite. Unhelpful, but polite.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs around,‚Äù the captain said vaguely. ‚ÄúYou might hear her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe hums,‚Äù offered Ortega. ‚ÄúMostly when something‚Äôs about to get better.‚Äù

Revane asked to see the engineer in person.

The AI responded:

‚ÄúLast visual contact: 37 hours ago, Deck 6. Current location: Probable interior structure zone. Possibly structural. Possibly fictional.‚Äù

Revane did not find this amusing.

His frustration only grew when he inspected the systems themselves. Everything‚Äîeverything‚Äîran better than spec. Redundancies were not just functioning, but optimized. Subsystems balanced each other with precision that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible without a full engineering team running manual adjustments.

The coffee machine offered him a cup before he asked. It was perfect.

He spent three days on the Merciful Abandon. No one located Maeve. At one point, he was handed a slip of paper that read:

‚ÄúSorry about the access hatch. It was in my way. Reattached it. Mostly.‚Äù
‚ÄîM.H.

There had been no report of a missing hatch.

On the fourth day, Revane submitted his findings via secure channel. The final line of the audit read:

‚ÄúHuman engineer demonstrates spatial omnipresence, disregard for structural integrity boundaries, and non-standard maintenance logic.
Systems exceed Fleet performance tolerances.
Recommend promotion.

Or exorcism.‚Äù

The audit was quietly archived. No follow-up inspection was scheduled.

Maeve reappeared that evening in the cargo bay, holding a coil of stripped wiring, an energy coupling adapter, and what looked like half a fruit. She handed the coupling to Ortega, dropped the wire into a crate, and walked to the galley.

No one said anything.

When the captain passed her on the way to the bridge, she asked, ‚ÄúWere you in the ducts again?‚Äù

Maeve paused mid-sip, shrugged, and said, ‚ÄúThe ducts were adjacent to the problem. So technically, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you fix something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just noticed things wanted to work better. So I helped.‚Äù

Vren nodded. ‚ÄúFile a report?‚Äù

Maeve smiled. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt help.‚Äù

No further questions were asked.

The ship jumped to its next waypoint.

1o6fy72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overcome_PE/comments/1o6fy72/how_caffeine_nicotine_and_alcohol_each_affect/,"How Caffeine, Nicotine, and Alcohol Each Affect Your Timing Differently","I keep seeing people ask if coffee, cigarettes, or a few drinks before sex help or hurt control ‚Äî so I pulled together what actually happens physiologically *and* what most guys report in real life.  
Turns out, each of these ‚Äúsocial drugs‚Äù hits your timing system in completely different ways.

# ‚òï Caffeine ‚Äì Speeds Up Everything, Including the Finish Line

Caffeine raises **adrenaline** and **cortisol**, which increases heart rate and blood flow.  
That might sound good for energy, but when it comes to lasting longer, it can backfire: your body enters a mild ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù state.  
Once arousal builds, your nerves fire faster, and you reach climax quicker.

**Common experience:**

* Easier to get hard, harder to stay calm.
* Sensitive body, racing mind.
* Great for stamina in the gym, not in bed.

**Tip:** If you drink coffee daily, try cutting caffeine 4‚Äì6 hours before sex. Many guys notice an instant bump in control.

# üö¨ Nicotine ‚Äì False Calm, Real Tension

Nicotine tricks the body into releasing dopamine and serotonin, which can *feel* calming, but it actually constricts blood vessels and reduces oxygen flow.  
That means weaker erections, less consistent blood pressure, and lower endurance.

Over time, smoking tightens pelvic muscles and limits circulation ‚Äî both bad for control.  
Some smokers last longer only because sensitivity drops, but it‚Äôs not the good kind of ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs the dull, disconnected kind.

**Tip:** If you‚Äôre quitting, expect your sensitivity to spike for a few weeks ‚Äî that‚Äôs your body healing, not regression.

# üç∑ Alcohol ‚Äì Slower Reflex, Slower Response

Alcohol depresses the central nervous system, so signals travel slower between brain and body.  
In small amounts, that delay can actually **help** with control because it dulls hypersensitivity and anxiety.  
But cross the line (2+ drinks for most men) and it kills erection quality, lowers testosterone, and delays orgasm so much it feels disconnected.

**Real-world rule:**

* 1 drink = calmer nerves, possibly better control.
* 3 drinks = soft erection, low awareness, poor rhythm.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Putting It Together

* **Caffeine:** Too fast, overstimulated.
* **Nicotine:** Restrictive, numbing, inconsistent.
* **Alcohol:** Relaxed, but easily too relaxed.

Your ‚Äútiming control‚Äù depends on your **nervous system balance** ‚Äî stimulation vs. relaxation.  
Caffeine and nicotine push you into overdrive; alcohol drags you into underdrive.  
The sweet spot is when you‚Äôre alert, grounded, and calm ‚Äî not wired or drunk.

That‚Äôs why some guys use breathing work, pelvic relaxation, or a mild herbal aid like *EjaGuard* instead of relying on stimulants or sedatives ‚Äî it helps regulate sensitivity without knocking the body off balance.

**TL;DR:**  
Coffee can make you finish faster, cigarettes make you inconsistent, and alcohol can delay you too much.  
Your best ‚Äúperformance enhancer‚Äù is still a calm nervous system, not a chemical shortcut.",1,1760449563.0,Overcome_PE,0,1.0,False

The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.  
*I'm not here to moan, or vent, promise!*

I go to work, i go through all the formalities talking with work colleagues who i have no real intention of becoming friends with, i have lunch on my own because i really cant stand how some people moan about the same thing day after day. I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV. 
*Wow, how boring does that sound?!*

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"",but please don't let that put you off! 
My friends would probably say that im quiet until i get to know someone, but really im just quietly confident. I'm easy to get on with and down to earth, somewhat flirtatious but always respectful.

1o6fy4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFACollect/comments/1o6fy4v/an_offer_for_you_if_youre_in_atlanta_area_buying/,An offer for you if you're in Atlanta area buying World Cup tickets in October.,"Hey everyone! I was selected in the first FIFA World Cup ticket lottery and already purchased some tickets, so I‚Äôve seen how the platform works firsthand. There‚Äôs a couple things that make it confusing and if I‚Äôd known that beforehand I would have gotten the tickets I really wanted.

One big tip I wish someone had told me earlier is to not wait until your exact start time to click your ‚ÄúBuy Tickets‚Äù link. Start about 30 minutes before your window opens. That way, you‚Äôll already be in the queue when they start letting people through. If you wait until your exact time, you might end up waiting another 30 minutes+ just to get in and miss out on your preferred tickets. You‚Äôll have the chance to purchase up to 40 tickets total, up to 4 tickets per match, and you can make multiple transactions. 

Here‚Äôs my offer: I‚Äôm willing to pay $125 for a chance to purchase tickets you don‚Äôt want to purchase for yourself. In return, I‚Äôll share what I learned so you can go into your purchase window knowing exactly what to expect and how to move quickly. Your tickets take priority, of course. Tickets start selling out in seconds, literally because as soon as someone adds the tickets to their cart you won't have access to them. I know how much tickets are selling for and have access to an entire spreadsheet that shows what each ticket, by seating category, is going for, for every single match, so you‚Äôll be able to plan ahead how much you‚Äôre willing to spend and for what seats to go for, and not waste precious time trying to decide. I also have access to images of all the stadiums that shows what each seating category looks like for each stadium. You cannot pick exact seat numbers yet, those will be assigned later. 

We‚Äôd basically meet an hour or so before your time window time so I can show you all of this. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not just open to games being held in Atlanta (in case you want to claim those for yourself), but I still prefer to do this in person with someone who lives in Atlanta so we can both feel comfortable and safe about the transaction. We could meet somewhere public, like a coffee shop, and handle the exchange together and both click our corresponding ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù button at the same time. I can do Zelle, Venmo, or even cash, whatever you trust more.

I‚Äôm happy to connect on Facebook first so you can see I‚Äôm not a scammer but a just a dad with a dream to go to the world cup. I really wish I‚Äôd seen a post like this before my own purchase window ‚Äî would‚Äôve saved me some stress and gotten me better tickets. Hopefully, this helps someone out and it‚Äôs a win-win for both of us! It will be a win for you guaranteed as long as you don‚Äôt plan to purchase more than 32 tickets (I‚Äôd like at least 8).

1o6fy4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1o6fy4n/reveal_the_best_cord_organizer_for_appliances_is/,Reveal the Best Cord Organizer for Appliances Is Searuodio Worth It,"Testing out the Searuodio RXQCO-1 brought some unexpected joys to my kitchen organization routine. At first glance, this little gadget seems like a simple contraption‚Äîa cord organizer for blenders, coffee makers, or air fryers‚Äîbut don‚Äôt underestimate its clever design. It promised to tackle the chaotic web of cords that dominate my countertop, and it truly delivered. Once I got it installed and operating, I started noticing just how much extra mental energy I had been expending dealing with tangled cables before.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The build of the appliance cord organizer surprised me right off the bat. Made from high-quality silicone, its soft yet durable texture feels dependable. It's flexible enough to wrap around tricky surfaces, but it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy or prone to wear and tear. The adhesive backing has some serious staying power too. I initially doubted whether the stick-on technology would hold up on curved surfaces like my air fryer, but it clings tightly once set (after waiting the recommended 12 hours). Even on awkwardly angled appliances like my coffee maker, the cord winder stuck perfectly in place.

[Check Searuodio RXQCO-1 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dkmzskvx/)

**Performance and Usability**  
Anyone who juggles multiple small appliances knows how cables can quickly take over limited counter space. I attached a few of these cord holders to my blender, pressure cooker, and toaster oven‚Äîa few appliances where long cords seem intentionally designed to create chaos. Wrapping up those cords with this organizer made such an immediate difference. Not only did it tidy things up, but it also reduced the time spent untangling cords when switching appliances. It's safe to say that managing these kitchen gadgets became way smoother.

**Key Benefits**  
- The silicone material is built to last and withstands frequent use.  
- Adhesive technology means no drilling or damaging appliances.  
- Simplifies cord storage for small kitchen appliances like coffee makers and blenders.  
- Time-saving and reduces the stress of dealing with messy kitchen surfaces.  

**Areas of Concern**  
For all its positives, there's one minor hiccup. The adhesive backing, while strong, is strictly a one-time-use kind of deal. If I misplaced the cord organizer during installation or needed to remove it for cleaning, there‚Äôs no second chance to stick it back. Replacement adhesives would be a thoughtful addition to the product. A few user reviews also mentioned an issue with the adhesive on especially rough surfaces, though I didn‚Äôt encounter that problem myself.

- Adhesive functionality is limited; repositioning isn‚Äôt an option.  
- Might not stick as well on textured appliance surfaces.  

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this cord organizer to others in the market, one noticeable difference is the versatility. While many competitors prioritize specific appliances, this organizer works on everything from kitchen mixers to hair dryers to extension cords. Brands offering competing products sometimes skimp on quality adhesives or stick to rigid plastic designs that only work on flat surfaces. I appreciated how adaptable the silicone material was and how it handled everything I threw at it‚Äîwhether my stand mixer‚Äôs bulky cords or my air fryer‚Äôs slippery plastic shell. Some other brands might use more reusable adhesive, but they often sacrifice the longevity of the hold.

**Financial Value**  
Looking at the functionality versus cost, this product hits the sweet spot for practicality. Tidy cables might not seem like a luxury, but when it comes to organizing your life (or at least your kitchen), the payoff is fast and noticeable. It‚Äôs one of those small investments that provides outsized returns. While there are cheaper alternatives out there, they often lack the same versatility. A blend of quality silicone and secure adhesive easily makes this a worthwhile buy for anyone running multiple appliances.

I‚Äôve been agoraphobic for a few years but I‚Äôve never been housebound/room bound. I‚Äôve been in cbt for a few months now and doing exposure therapy every day. 

A few weeks ago I committed to doing exposure therapy every day and I now I walk about 5/6km a day most days (about 3-4miles). I have a slowly expanding safe bubble and I challenge myself weekly to go further or try something that scares me. On Saturday I got my haircut; met a friend for coffee for three hours; walked to the bus stop together then got the bus home alone. I even sat in the sunshine in the park for an hour just vibing, no panic at all. It gave me a taste of independence and freedom I haven‚Äôt had in what feels like forever, even though I‚Äôve literally left the country four times this year alone, including three international flights! My point is, I can often just suck up the fear and eventually settle, or as my therapist says ‚Äòpanic has a time limit‚Äô (great reason to try wait it out!), so I just deal with the exhaustion later.

My problem is that knowing that feeling again has made me fucking miserable. I feel so depressed at home, so anxious outside my home. I get so upset I have to do this stupid exposure therapy every day and I can‚Äôt keep living like my friends do. I know I‚Äôve made awesome progress but I see a dismal future ahead where I struggle forever. I don‚Äôt want that.

1o6fv07,https://www.reddit.com/r/gdevelop/comments/1o6fv07/a_guide_to_publishing_games_on_the_microsoft_store/,A guide to publishing games on the Microsoft Store.,"Here is a tutorial on packing and publishing a game on Microsoft Store.  


The Problem: I made a game using GDevelop and I found that there was almost no guide on how to publish a game on Microsoft store. If you try publishing a game on Microsoft Store, you will find that you can't directly publish "".exe"" files. Instead you have to upload the newer file formats such as "".msix"", "".appx"", etc.

Let's start the process:

1. First step is to have a Microsoft Developer Account. You can make a normal personal account (or use existing account) if you want to publish as an individual. To make the account, go to [Microsoft Store Developer Platform](https://storedeveloper.microsoft.com/en-US/home) website  ( [More info about the process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/whats-new-individual-developer) ) or go to this website (fee is applicable here) [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/register](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/register) . (If this link doesn't work sometime in the future, just search for Microsoft Store Developer account)

As of 2025, Individual Developer Account doesn't cost any money. For a Company, the fee is one time payment of $99.

(You will also have to verify your identity by uploading necessary documents and a selfie verification)

2. Packaging: Now we have to convert the ""exe"" generated from GDevelop to a suitable format for the Microsoft Store. We will do this by using a free tool from Microsoft called [""MSIX Packaging Tool""](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N5LW3JBCXKF?hl=en-us&gl=IN&ocid=pdpshare) ( [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N5LW3JBCXKF?hl=en-us&gl=IN&ocid=pdpshare](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N5LW3JBCXKF?hl=en-us&gl=IN&ocid=pdpshare) ). Install it and then proceed to the next step.

  
3. Now first turn off all the startup apps from Task Manager and then restart the computer. Now open the MSIX Packaging Tool and select ""Application Package""

[Select \\""Application package : Create your app package\\""](https://preview.redd.it/l7lpuu8tf1vf1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=307aafa27d1edcb752b878401c9b35d2980afef1)

Now you will see 3 Options. It is advised to use the third option (Create package on a local Virtual Machine) but since I am on Windows 11 Home, I will proceed with the first option (Create Package on this computer). If you're using the first option, it is advised to use it on a clean windows installation.

[Choose any of the three options. The Ultimate Goal is to have a clean windows environment.](https://preview.redd.it/uxogfoa3g1vf1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb1c1b88f391c0fe0358063914e65ccaa5ebfde)

Press ""Next"". If it the first time you are using the tool then wait for MSIX Packaging Tool Driver to finish installing. (If it gives error, try it after a few hours). If it shows ""Pending Restart"" then close the tool and restart the computer and continue.  
Tick the ""Windows Search is active"" and Click the ""Disable Selected"" and press ""Next""

Now click on ""Browse"" and select the ""exe"" file you exported from GDevelop. Leave the Signing preference unselected or select ""Do not sign package"" (Microsoft will sign it itself while publishing). If you have a certificate you can select it here. Press ""Next"".

4. Before continuing further, go to your Microsoft Partner Website. [Microsoft Partner Center - Home](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/home) .

Go to ""Apps and games"" and click on ""New product"" and select ""Game""

Now type your game's name and click on ""Check availability"". If the name is not available then you can modify it to your liking. (You won't have to re-export the game from GDevelop, we haven't converted the game to msix yet)

Now click on ""Reserve product name"".

Now go to the very bottom and click on ""View product identity""

https://preview.redd.it/ybvmnza4a2vf1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84f0951b84a65e8dda5720039f54b6eed79dbb8

Keep this open and now return to ""MSIX Packaging Tool"". Now one by one copy the above information and paste it in the respective fields of ""MSIX Packaging Tool"".

https://preview.redd.it/h4ef8qjzb2vf1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=f014b3b4393aaca72ba0ad6fafa5264a6b7abdf5

You can leave the ""Installation location blank"". 

Now click ""Next"".

You can skip the Accelerator part by pressing ""Next"" (We don't need accelerator)

https://preview.redd.it/c0movmaqc2vf1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=d040c02981cc9eec846bbfcb0bd75816c6e4b65f

Wait for a while for installation to finish. (**Don't** press the Restart machine button)

After the installation is finished, close the game if it auto-starts.

Click next and wait for ""Entry Points"" to be fetched. Then just click ""Next"" and ""Yes, move on""

I *am* different now.  
Fuck mysterious, I‚Äôm being transparent today.   
It‚Äôs been 2 weeks and 4 days since the event that shifted everything for me.  
Nah, I didn‚Äôt see a light.  
There was no life movie montage, I heard no angels singing, I don‚Äôt remember any warm embrace or a big release.  
No crowds of cheering people to call me home.  
Just cold. Dark. Slapped and shaken awake in a pile of my own vomit.  
Like, fuck. Fail.   
I did a thing and the only thing I achieved was scaring the people who care for me, setting up a years worth of therapy appointments and getting myself into trouble. 
Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk.  
I know. I fucked up.   


The funny thing is I don‚Äôt necessarily feel any lighter, I don‚Äôt know that my passion for life is renewed or anything but I gotta believe that maybe I was given a second chance for a reason. Maybe there‚Äôs something more for me, like an actual purpose or whatever?  
Like maybe you don‚Äôt go through hell and back AND survive just to keep doing the same old shit that lead you to that option in the first place?   
And maybe cutting ties with old attachments, addictions and fuckinggggg bullshit self harming coping mechanisms that I‚Äôve been using since I was a wounded little girl could actually HELP make me the better version of myself I am trying to be????   


So maybe that includes putting down the bottle and picking up a paintbrush. Using my voice and communicating my feelings and emotions instead of quieting myself for others comfort. Asking for help when I‚Äôm struggling instead of putting on some kind of ‚Äústrong‚Äù front and falling deeper into that black hole. Appreciating the little things that bring me joy; laughing, singing, writing, creating, the friends that continue to stick by me, seeing my family‚Äôs smiling faces, a big hug, let‚Äôs be forreal MEMES, fucking HALLOWEEN, coffee in the morning, my perfect cat, making people feel BEAUTIFUL, muuuuuusssiiiccccc, and my pretty rocks I keep all over the house, I could really just go on and on but I‚Äôm realizing that what I‚Äôve been missing was GRATITUDE.   


So yeah, maybe I haven‚Äôt noticeably changed to you, I look the same, I‚Äôve got the same self deprecating humor, I‚Äôm gonna struggle every day and most likely will fail some more because I‚Äôm HUMAN and not perfect.

If you're even thinking about dollars instead of hours of your short and fleeting life that you have to trade to an already hours-rich corporation, then you're stuck. 

If you do not realize that close to HALF your pre-tax money goes to income taxes, leaving you with HALF of what they promised you, meaning that HALF of the hours of your life's productivity, your vital life force, goes to fund a government that is currently SHUT DOWN AND DOING NOTHING WHILE THEY DISTRACT YOU FROM THE PEDOPHILE FILES, then you're straight-up tricked. 

If you're forgetting that they tax you again whenever you exist, through social security they'll never give you and sales tax when you go to spend whatever remaining money you might have left, then they've got you where they want you.

And let's not forget all the government's friends who lobby to be able to charge you obscene rates for health insurance, etc. Let's not forget how many hours of your waking life you spend on ever-increasing insurance premiums due to all the unnecessary scans they hand out like candy once they get your insurance information in the system and start looking for ways to spend your money.

The scam in this country is that they spend our money for us, while they get to live tax free, and inside trade, and waste tax dollars on vacations to their friends' tax-free sex islands or whatever the aristocracy does with our money until they get caught for it.

This whole country is an exercise taxation without representation. In hiring the unscrupulous figurehead who stands on stage and reads a meaningless script and reveals that he failed the memory test and unconsciously blurts out his endless list of sins because none of it matters because we're all so stuck and helpless and poor and desperate. 

The scam is that you have to work 40 hours a week and still can't afford a break, when all these former lower-level government employees are available to do at least some of your work due to unemployment and but they still made you think you have to work more and harder just try keep your slave wages. The scam is that you have to give up half to the government tax before you give up half of the rest to rent before you give up half the rest to childcare before you give up half the rest to school loans before you get taxed while spending what's left on $10 eggs or $8 coffee or whatever they try to get away with next. 

It's all fake. It's all carefully calculated to keep us afraid and busy so we work work work until it sets us free.

But they changed the calculation and that murdered the American dream because we all now see the truth is that only those born with money can ever find enough of it to live free. Without taxes. Without laws. Without endless toil.

They print money and set interest rates and tax us half to death until we feel we need to work endlessly just to afford to put food on the table. Then they threaten all of us with deportation, even the citizens, to scare us into saying nothing. And then they blame us for how much we want to eat avocados on toast, when THEY KNOW HOW DELICIOUS IT IS.

But all of this is just a complicated way to use money as a diversion so we don't realize that the slaves were never actually set free. They just made us pay for the privilege.",2,1760449035.0,conspiracy,2,1.0,False

I first noticed blood during BMs and discomfort about 5 weeks ago and made some lifestyle changes ASAP to get to where I am now (no blood in almost a week!). Currently looking for any advice anyone in remission / management has for keeping them as gone as possible.

My hemorrhoids were almost certainly exclusively caused by long periods of sitting, so in addition to taking most of the general management advice, I've been extremely careful to avoid sitting for longer than 5 hours a day, for no more than 90 minutes at a time without a long break. I'm WFH and have been able to shift my obligations around for the last few weeks to make this happen, but now I've got a lot of sit-down work to get done that'll require me to spend >6 hours a day seated again.

Current lifestyle / management:

\- Avoiding long, uninterrupted periods of sitting. I stand up for a couple minutes every 30 min, and every 90 or so minutes I do something to promote circulation throughout my whole body (this is anything from 10 min of an active chore like vacuuming to doing a full workout). Upped my workout frequency from 3x a week to 5x and included more low-intensity cardio.

\- I sit on a cushion, but I did this even before getting hemorrhoids, not sure if it's really doing me any good in that way.

\- 900mg diosmin / 100mg hesperidin twice a day.

\- At least two servings of a high fiber food per day, minimal coffee, lots of hydrating foods and water.

\- Bidet, toilet stool, not spending more than a few minutes in the bathroom. Witch hazel wipes anytime there's irritation.

\- Bought some prep H cream yesterday, will throw that into the mix with the witch hazel wipes (I'll apply them both at night). This is starting to get into ""everything but the kitchen sink"" territory; not sure if it'll help, but it's cheap and probably doesn't hurt to try.

Simple order with white bread lettuce tomato and hot bacon. 
The woman behind the counter slapped that label on the container for a 6 item breakfast roll costing 6.50. 

When I challenged this she said that it came with a free cup of coffee, and seeing as I was running late at the berudgingly took the Sandwich up to the counter. Once they scanned up my purchase the asking price had increased to 7.50, and when I complained again they just simply pointed to a sign over the deli and said that it was a meal deal. 

I really couldn't get over the ignorance and indifference of the staff. The woman at the deli counter was bolshy as anything and the staff at the till were clueless to what a BLT is. The manager came over to deal with my complaint and was smirking and rude. Conversation ended when he said he could ring it up as a BLT but it would cost more than the 7.50 I was asked to pay. 

I frequently buy the same sandwich in supervalu Midleton for less than 3 euro so it is clear that this shop is only motivated by pure greed and ripping off customers. 

Also I can't let the opportunity go by and not comment on the absolute waste of packaging used to sell this sandwich. 
Look at the stupid carton and plastic lid, so bad for the environment and difficult to take out the sandwich. It disintegrated the minute I tried to lift it out.

Here‚Äôs what the remake includes:

üëä Improved Combat System ‚Äì New techniques, combos, and unlockable skills earned through experience. Every enemy you defeat helps your character grow.

üé® Visual Upgrades ‚Äì Dynamic lighting, a wider camera view, and new VFX while keeping the original pixel-art spirit alive.

üó∫Ô∏è Expanded Levels ‚Äì Original areas plus brand-new secret zones for those who love exploring every corner.

This is a fanmade, non-commercial project, built purely for learning, challenge, and passion. My goal was to modernize a classic while staying true to its soul.

Right after school, Kira rushed into class shouting,

> ‚ÄúCoffee Day just launched a Navel Drink!‚Äù



Everyone turned their heads. ‚ÄúYou mean, The Navel movie?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù Kira said, holding up her phone. ‚ÄúZoe just posted it! The cup glows in blue light when you stir it!‚Äù

So obviously, our group‚Äîme, Penny, Monique, Carmen, Siu Ling, and Winfrey‚Äîdecided to go there straight after school.

When we arrived at Coffee Day, the whole caf√© looked futuristic. The staff, including Zoe, Ayaka, and Haruka, were wearing sleek black outfits with glowing blue lines‚Äîlike the sisters from The Navel! Even Mr. Tanaka was there helping behind the counter, smiling politely and serving customers.

‚ÄúWelcome to Coffee Day‚Äôs Digital Dimension!‚Äù Zoe greeted cheerfully.
Haruka added, ‚ÄúTry our new limited drink: The Navel Latte! It‚Äôs a blue vanilla mix with edible shimmer dust!‚Äù

We all ordered it right away. When the barista poured the milk foam, the drink shimmered like glowing data‚Äîit was so cool! Penny even said, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm downloading caffeine into my soul.‚Äù

While we were sipping, Carmen opened her phone and said, ‚ÄúHey, look what I found trending since last weekend.‚Äù

She showed us a whole bunch of paintball photos from the second episode of The Adventures of the Mud Queen! There were girls covered in colorful paint splashes, posing with paintball guns, laughing, and sticking out their tongues‚Äîeverywhere!

Monique laughed so hard she almost choked on her latte. ‚ÄúOh my gosh, that‚Äôs so Lila Bellyton-style! Look at them! Mud, paint, and chaos!‚Äù
Kira said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally a trend now‚Äîpeople call it ‚ÄòThe Mud Queen Challenge!‚Äô You get splattered with paint and post your funniest pose!‚Äù

Then Penny looked at me with a mischievous grin. ‚ÄúAmy, we should totally do it this weekend!‚Äù
I almost spit out my drink. ‚ÄúWhat? Me? Covered in paint?‚Äù
Winfrey smirked. ‚ÄúCome on, the last time you went viral, you didn‚Äôt even plan it!‚Äù

Everyone laughed again, and Zoe, passing by our table, smiled and said, ‚ÄúIf you ever film it here, I‚Äôll sponsor the clean-up towels.‚Äù

We stayed there for almost two hours, talking about The Navel, laughing at Mud Queen memes, and enjoying the glowing drinks. The caf√© was filled with cheerful noise‚Äîsome people even wore glow bands to match the theme!

When I got home, Mom asked, ‚ÄúDid you have fun at Coffee Day?‚Äù
I showed her my cup that still glowed faintly blue and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just coffee anymore, Mom‚Äîit‚Äôs a whole digital experience!‚Äù

A Detailed Review,"Testing the Brita OB08 Plus Water Filter has been an eye-opener for me as someone who takes hydration and sustainability quite seriously. This high-density replacement filter for pitchers and dispensers claims to reduce twice the contaminants compared to standard filters, which immediately piqued my interest. Over the course of regular use, the product revealed both its impressive capabilities and a few nuances that potential buyers should definitely consider.

**Performance and Water Quality Improvement**

I have to admit, the difference in water taste was noticeable almost instantly. This filter uses activated carbon and ion exchange resin to reduce chlorine, copper, cadmium, and even some less-mentioned contaminants. The result? Water that actually tastes clean and refreshing. I‚Äôve tested it against unfiltered tap water, and there‚Äôs no contest‚Äîmy tea and coffee have never tasted better. Plus, it mostly eliminates the odd ""chemical"" smell that sometimes plagues tap water. However, while the filter does a fantastic job with taste and smell, it doesn‚Äôt claim to remove all impurities, which might make it slightly less appealing for those needing advanced filtration.

**Build and Compatibility**

What surprised me is how lightweight the filter is, clocking in at just 13.44 ounces. It‚Äôs made of plastic but feels sturdy enough for the job. It‚Äôs also quite compact at 7.25""D x 2.41""W x 5.5""H, which means it doesn‚Äôt consume an overwhelming amount of space in your pitcher or dispenser. One of its strengths is its versatility‚Äîit works with all Brita systems except for the Stream models. This was perfect in my household as we already own a Brita pitcher. Swapping out the old filter for this one took less than thirty seconds.

**Highlights**

- Filters out twice the contaminants compared to standard Brita filters.
- Improves water‚Äôs taste and reduces chlorine odors.
- Easy installation with universal compatibility for most Brita systems.
- Can replace up to 300 single-use plastic bottles per filter.

**Longevity and Sustainability**

One of my favorite aspects of this product is its commitment to reducing plastic waste. Each filter lasts two months or 40 gallons, depending on your usage. For my family, which averages about ten glasses of water per day, this proves pretty accurate. The environmental impact is impressive, as one filter can replace up to 300 single-use plastic bottles. Over a year, that‚Äôs around 1,800 bottles! It feels good knowing I‚Äôm making a small but meaningful contribution to lessening ocean-bound plastic waste. Still, if you‚Äôre focused on long-term cost efficiency, it might be worth calculating how often you need replacements versus other brands.

**Good Points**

- Environmental benefits by reducing single-use plastics.
- Long-lasting filter life that meets everyday needs.
- Simple and quick filter replacement process.

**Shortcomings**

Though I appreciate its effectiveness, there are a few things I noticed that could be improved:

- Initially, there‚Äôs a slight chance of black carbon flecks appearing in the water, so it‚Äôs essential to soak the filter and flush it sufficiently before use.
- While it reduces many contaminants, it doesn‚Äôt target pathogens or nitrates, so it might fall short in areas with concerning water quality issues.
- Replacement filters are on the pricier side for this type of product, making it less budget-friendly if you‚Äôre filtering a large volume of water regularly.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other replacement water filters, Brita‚Äôs Plus models stand out primarily for their ease of use and the trust associated with the brand. However, products like PUR filters boast similar contaminant reduction capabilities while offering slightly cheaper options. On the other hand, ZeroWater filters claim to remove 99.6% of all dissolved solids, a feature this Brita filter does not match. I personally find the Brita filter more than sufficient for regular tap water as it strikes a better balance between cost and functionality. However, in areas where water hardness or impurity levels are extreme, ZeroWater might be a more suitable contender.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**

Despite a couple of minor drawbacks, I believe the Brita Plus Water Filter brings a solid value proposition to the table. Its smart engineering, reliable everyday performance, and positive environmental impact make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to improve their water quality. Though not the absolute cheapest, the superior taste it delivers makes up for the slightly higher replacement cost.

1o6feow,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6feow,My fasting journey,"About 2 years ago, stqrted with 16:8 fasting. lost a few kg's. Did it 3-4 times during the week at the office.
pick up again, no diet, no excercise, just relied on my fast metabolism.

40's hit, and i am about 8 kgs over ehat i want to be.

started fasting again, but went longer, and took every day as it came.

What helped me:
* Keto sticks, if i see small traces, it motivates me to go a bit longer.
* i did research, whatch motivational stuff, started excercising, joined more subreddits/instagram that would constantly remind me for what i am working towards.
* starting to learn calorie counting, first time in my life
* buying better groceries
*drinking even more water, no more normal soda
* adjusted as per events popup.
* everyday, i do research, and educate myself more on macros, gym positions, different scales, there is so much, but i do enjoy it!
* i still enjoy snacks and sweet stuff, just in smaller portions, and in eating time
* learn to say no!
* i actually like black coffee! (sugar was easy to cut aa i was on half a tsp anyway)
*smaller portions
* i actually like spinach in salads!

* I feel good!
*This is something i can keep doing! it is not a chore, or a punishment. 
* each day creates a new target, to push further, my next aim is 36hours. 
just to say i can! 

What made it harder:
*Sunday afternoon movie nights. no snacking! 
* alcohol, reduced my intake on ciders, but there is still vodka and sprite zero!
* knowing i sometimes have only 1 meal, i can not eat leftovers, because tommorow is another dish i do noy want to miss ouf on
* constipation, the last 3 weeks i am trying out soaked chia seeds, psylium husk, dolcolax, still on that train...
* i am the main cook in house, and cant leave the rest to one meal a day, so i make enough for leftovers, and self service options for next meal i am not part of.
*colleques making comments, like i feel so sorry for you, you are not allowed to eat! (i made the choice! i am happy about it!) they make up again when they say, you are losing to much weight;)

Even if the scale is up, no worries, i will loose it again. Does not discourage me. 
But through this journey, i definetly made some changes that will last!

My struggle now: learning what a balanced diet is, and getting the correct nutrients... 
but the pros is much more than the cons!

i like detail, so for interest i also wheighed at night and mornings, and i accept all fluctuations more easily!

The thing you gotta understand about decking is that it ain‚Äôt about the wood. It‚Äôs about the level.

My name‚Äôs Dave, and I install decks. I roll out of the van at 7:30 AM, smelling faintly of sawdust and cheap coffee, ready to wage war against the relentless, gravitational truth that no backyard in the Western Hemisphere is perfectly flat. This morning, my battleground was Mrs. Peterson‚Äôs garden, a manicured slice of suburbia where everything looked tidy except for the actual, underlying earth.

The plan was a simple 30-square-meter composite deck. But here‚Äôs the confession: the moment I pulled out my transit level, the jig was up. Mrs. Peterson‚Äôs patio, which she insisted was ""perfectly even, dear, only just laid three years ago,"" was off by a solid four inches corner-to-corner. Four inches! That‚Äôs less a patio and more a gentle, water-shedding slope leading directly to the neighbour‚Äôs prize-winning roses.

My first confession of the day? I lied.

""No problem at all, Mrs. Peterson,"" I said, flashing the reassuring, gap-toothed smile that usually costs an extra hundred quid in ‚Äòdifficulty tax.‚Äô What I meant was, This is going to be three hours of pure, shim-driven rage, and I will sweat in places I didn‚Äôt know existed.

The day dissolved into the frantic choreography of a man trying to make an unstable geometry look stable. I was a structural engineer with a screw gun, constantly battling warped joists‚Äîthe second confession. Composite boards might be perfect, but the structural timber underneath always seems to have a personality disorder. Trying to screw a bowed 4x2 to a dead-straight ledger board is like arguing with a teenager: you know you‚Äôre right, but they just won‚Äôt conform.

Around lunchtime, I hit the biggest hurdle: the post code. Every deck needs a neat post near the corner for the railing. I had measured three times, marked, and drilled. But when I dropped the last post, it was six millimeters‚Äîjust a hair‚Äîout of alignment with the string line. Six millimeters. Ninety-nine percent of people wouldn't see it, but I could. It looked like the post was mildly drunk.

Confession number three, and the most satisfying: I pulled it all out. I chipped out the concrete and reset the post base perfectly. It cost me 45 minutes, a chunk of my sanity, and some choice words aimed at inanimate objects, but when I finally stepped back, the line was laser-straight. It‚Äôs the small, obsessive victories that stop you from quitting and becoming a barista.

By 4 PM, with the final hidden clips snapped into place and the perimeter boards fixed, the deck was done. It was flawless. Flat as a billiard table.

Mrs. Peterson came out, gasped dramatically, and said, ""Oh, Dave, it‚Äôs gorgeous! It looks so easy when you do it!""

My final, silent confession as I packed up my tools? It wasn't. But sometimes, making it look easy is the hardest part of the job.

I just nodded, accepted the lukewarm payment cheque, and drove off, leaving behind a perfectly level surface ready for summer barbecues, built atop a structure of sweat, minor deceit, and perfectly hidden shims. Tomorrow, I fight a tree root.",1,1760448140.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False

My best friend Sarah and I have been friends since highschool. Were 26 now, known each other for over 10 years. Shes like a sister to me or at least she was.

Three years ago I dated this guy Matt for about 8 months. At first he was great, really charming and attentive. Then he started getting controlling. Didnt want me hanging out with guy friends, would check my phone, got jealous over everything.

One night we got into an argument at his apartment. I dont even remember what it was about. He got really angry and grabbed me. Then he forced himself on me. I said no multiple times. I was crying. He didnt stop.

I broke up with him the next day over text. I was too scared to do it in person. He blew up my phone for weeks. I blocked him everywhere.

I never told anyone what really happened. I told Sarah we broke up because he was controlling and jealous. I didnt tell her about the assault. I was ashamed and confused and I just wanted to forget about it.

Two months ago Sarah mentioned she met a guy on Hinge. Said hes really sweet and they've been on a few dates. Showed me a picture.

It was Matt.

I immediately panicked. Told her she needs to stop seeing him. She asked why and I didnt know what to say. I said hes bad news, hes controlling, she deserves better.

She said Im just bitter because hes my ex and I need to let her be happy. Said it was years ago and people change.

I didnt tell her the truth then. I should have but I couldnt get the words out.

Now its been 2 months and theyre official. She posts about him constantly. How sweet he is, how attentive, how hes ""not like other guys."" All the same things I thought at first.

Last week I finally told her what happened. We were having coffee and I just broke down and told her everything. That he assaulted me. That Im terrified hes going to hurt her.

She didnt believe me.

She said if it really happened I would have told someone at the time. She said Im making it up because Im jealous shes happy. She said Matt warned her that I might try to sabotage their relationship because I ""never got over him.""

He told her I was obsessed with him. That I was the crazy ex.

I showed her the texts from after we broke up where he was harassing me and calling me names. She said that doesnt prove assault. Said it just proves we had a bad breakup.

She said shes sorry I feel that way but she believes Matt.

I havent talked to her since. Shes texted me a few times saying Im being dramatic and that she hopes I can be happy for her.

I dont know what to do. Shes my best friend. I love her. But shes dating the person who assaulted me and she doesnt believe me. Worse, she thinks Im lying for attention.

I cant be around them together. I cant pretend everythings okay. But also I cant just abandon her when I know what hes capable of.

My therapist says I need to set boundaries and accept that I cant control Sarah's choices. That I need to protect myself first.

But what if he hurts her? What if something happens and I could have prevented it?

I feel like Im going crazy. Like maybe I am making too big of a deal and people do change. But then I remember that night and I know hes dangerous.

I dont know if I should keep trying to convince her or just walk away. I dont know if theres anything I can do.

She was supposed to be my maid of honor at my wedding next year. Now I dont even know if were friends anymore.

What should I do? How do I make her understand without losing her completely? Or is it already too late?

1o6fbet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o6fbet/aita_for_not_taking_disrespect_from_my_friend/,AITA for not taking disrespect from my friend even though she‚Äôs going through a hard time?,"Beth and I (36 F) have been best friends for 10 years. Her husband is seriously unwell. She has been going through a rough time balancing caring for him alongside full time work and caring for her mom who is also unwell.

I have been a huge support, driving her to the hospital or picking her up from there. Showing up with care packages, food and flowers regularly. Cleaning her house. I even got her a job at my company which was more pay and offered healthcare benefits. An emotional support where we speak daily about her struggles and feelings. I also try and cheer her up, going on coffee dates, shopping, cinema etc and I always have her back. Even the night her grandad was passing away I stepped in and supported her by providing medical care for her husband so that she could say goodbye.

Last weekend we had planned to go shopping and I offered to drive. She lives a 15min drive away from me and the shops were a further 15min drive from her house. She had to be back for 6pm to care for her husband. I left at 2pm. This would give us approx 3-3.5 hours at the mall.

However there was a terrible 4 car pile up half way between my home and hers and the entire city came to standstill. As soon as I hit traffic, I called her to let her know the situation and that I would be late. She said it was fine and no rush. However I didn‚Äôt move for another hour so I called her and said it‚Äôs not looking good but hopefully it will clear and we will still be able to go shopping. After another hour I still hadn‚Äôt moved by 4pm, so I had now spent 2 hours stuck in the same spot. I would likely not get to her until 6pm which is when she would need to be home to do caring responsibilities. So I called her again profusely apologising and explaining I think we had better call it off for this reason. Her tone was clipped. She said ‚Äúget yourself home. have a lovely evening‚Äù and hung up. It was frosty, but I understood she was disappointed.

2.5 hours after this I arrived home. It was now past 6:30pm and I had been in the traffic for over 4.5 hours since 2pm in what should have taken 15 mins. I was thirsty and desperate for the bathroom but the first thing I did was text her saying ‚ÄúI literally just walked through the door can‚Äôt believe it! I‚Äôm so sorry about today I was really looking forward to it. Shall we try again tomorrow? Xxx‚Äù She replied:

‚ÄúI am unavailable tomorrow.‚Äù

Again I understood she was disappointed, but I was a little bit surprised at her reaction since the accident was all over the news and I was sending her pictures of the mad queues I was in and police everywhere. I know wasn‚Äôt my fault that there was traffic and I couldn‚Äôt get to her, but I do understand sometimes people under stress can be a bit snappy. I figured I‚Äôve apologised so now I‚Äôll give her some space to cool off.

The next day, I didn‚Äôt hear from her. We usually talk several times a day over text but I told myself ‚Äúshe did say she was busy‚Äù. 

Later, she posted a story on insta. It was a picture of her in a cafe, laughing and holding up a book titled ‚Äúhow to kill your best friend‚Äù. She had captioned the image with ‚Äúlovely day out shopping and coffee with my bestie‚Äù and tagged an old school friend she catches up with a few times a year.

It‚Äôs important to note here, that when she feels slighted by people she enjoys making passive agressive digs via social media as revenge. She has admitted to this to me recently and  in the past even asked me to join in, which I never did.

It‚Äôs Tuesday late afternoon now and I still haven‚Äôt heard from her since the frosty text on Saturday after the traffic jam.

I haven‚Äôt reached out again since. The last time we spoke, I offered to rearrange and she shut me down with a cold reply and is now icing me out and making these pass-ahh digs on social media. So, I am now getting fed up with how little compassion she is showing me after I have shown her plenty of kindness. I want to take a step back and not put myself in a position where I am giving up so much of my time and energy for someone who is willing to cast me aside and be cruel to me at the slightest inconvenience.

AITAH for not trying to reach out and ‚Äúfix‚Äù this, given that she really IS going through a tough time? I know we need to give people who are struggling some grace but AITAH if I step away from this?

But after months of trial and error, these are the weird things that actually made a difference (for me)

1. Drink 1 liter of water right after waking up  
Sounds dumb, but it literally shocks your brain awake. I don‚Äôt even touch caffeine until 30 min later. It clears the fog better than any espresso.

2. Wear anti blue light glasses  
They‚Äôre not magic, but they make me focus faster. It also hydrate your eyes, so are not tired after 3 hours.

3. Record yourself studying  
I started recording short clips of me working (just with my phone propped up). It tricks your brain into accountability mode like you‚Äôre being watched, even if no one is. OR you can use¬†[this site](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=23)

4. Block distractions like your life depends on it  
Use somtg like¬†[Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/)¬†and¬†[Freedom](https://freedom.to/?irpid=56411&subId1=1-g-Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=56411&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=808733665&gbraid=0AAAAADLv4uSBNq1p5LzMwxGpG1MCeruAH&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB). But honestly the simplest hack is to put your phone in another room. If you want to understand why your brain keeps reaching for it, this video blew my mind:¬†[¬†Why you can‚Äôt focus ‚Äì Andrew Huberman explains dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY)

5.Reward yourself like you‚Äôre training a dog (because you kind of are)  
I set small rewards: finish a chapter: take a coffee. finish an assignment: 15 min scroll.  
This alspo sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.

6. Cold water on wrists before a session  
If you feel sleepy, run cold water over your wrists for 15 seconds. It literally wakes your body up through nerve stimulation (learned this from a med student works too well).

7. 2x speed learning  
I watch lectures at¬†**2x speed**¬†while taking notes in shorthand. Then rewatch the confusing parts at normal speed. I retain more because it forces me to actually listen.

8. Study outfit = focus mode  
I literally have a hoodie I only wear when I study. When I put it on, my brain knows it‚Äôs game time.

10. No perfect days just streaks  
I stopped trying to be 100% productive. I just aim not to break the chain. Missed a session? Fine. But never two in a row. Consistency beats intensity every time.",38,1760447884.0,studytips,2,0.95,False

Everyone keeps asking me how Im doing. Coworkers, friends, family, everyone. And I always say ""Im good"" or ""hanging in there"" or whatever generic response gets them to stop asking.

Im not good. Im really not good.

I lost my job 3 months ago. Not because of performance or anything, just budget cuts. I worked there for 8 years. They gave me two weeks severance and said good luck.

I havent told anyone. My parents think Im still working. My friends think Im still working. I get up every morning, get dressed, and leave the house like Im going to work. Then I sit in coffee shops or the library or just drive around until 5pm and come home.

My savings are almost gone. Rent is due in a week and I dont have it. I've applied to probably 200 jobs and gotten maybe 5 interviews. Nothing.

Im 34 years old and I might have to move back in with my parents. But I cant tell them because then theyll know I've been lying for months. And I cant face that conversation.

My girlfriend doesnt know either. We've been together for 2 years. She thinks everything is fine. We're supposed to go on vacation next month that I cant afford but I already said yes to because I didnt know how to say no without explaining why.

I've been using credit cards to pay for everything. Im about $8000 in debt now. I know thats not that bad compared to some people but for me its the most debt I've ever had and I have no way to pay it off.

Last week I had a panic attack in a Target parking lot. Just completely broke down crying in my car. Some lady knocked on my window asking if I was okay. I lied and said I was fine.

I lie about everything now. ""How was work?"" Fine. ""Want to grab dinner?"" Sure, even tho I cant afford it. ""Hows the job search going?"" Im not really looking, Im happy where I am.

The worst part is I dont even know what Im waiting for anymore. Like what am I hoping will happen? That a job will magically appear? That the money will fix itself?

I've thought about just telling everyone the truth but I've lied for so long now that it feels impossible. They'll want to know why I didnt say something sooner. And I dont have a good answer except that I was embarrassed and scared and stupid.

My lease is up in 2 months. I've been avoiding thinking about it. Where am I gonna go? What am I gonna do?

Sometimes I fantasize about just leaving. Like getting in my car and driving until I run out of gas and starting over somewhere where no one knows me and no one has expectations.

I know thats not realistic. I know I need to face this. I know I need to tell people and ask for help.

But I cant. Every time I try to have the conversation the words get stuck. And then I just say ""Im fine"" again and change the subject.

I've been having these thoughts lately. Not like actively suicidal thoughts but just... wondering what the point is. Like what am I even doing? Working jobs that dont matter, pretending everything is okay, slowly drowning in debt and lies.

I dont know what Im asking for here. Advice? Sympathy? Just to say it out loud even if its just typing it to strangers?

I'm not okay. And I dont know how to fix it. And Im tired of pretending.

Sorry this is so long and depressing. I just needed to tell someone, even if its anonymous people on reddit who dont know me.

Thank you for taking a moment to hear my story.

My name is Ayla. 25 years old and  a third-year engineering student . Until recently, I balanced full-time studies with a full-time caf√© job on minimum wage, and I‚Äôve always tried to give back when I could.

My life changed after my father‚Äîour family‚Äôs breadwinner‚Äîpassed away. I‚Äôm now helping my family survive: my two sisters and my younger brother depend on me. Because of everything happening, I haven‚Äôt been able to study or work for the past four months.

I‚Äôm also facing serious health challenges. I urgently need high-risk spinal surgery. Screws from a previous operation have shifted into the middle of my spinal canal and are putting my spinal cord at risk‚ÄîI‚Äôm terrified of becoming paralyzed. The pain is severe and even basic tasks‚Äîlike bathing or making coffee‚Äîare difficult. In addition, I have cervical neck disc problems and loss of kyphosis in my neck, which worsen my symptoms and daily function. I also have celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder) , severe anemia, all of which complicate treatment. Several surgeons have declined due to the risk; I need a team with the right technology and expertise.

I don‚Äôt have public health insurance here; as a foreigner in T√ºrkiye, I‚Äôm not covered and must pay out of pocket.

I‚Äôm humbly asking for your help to fund my surgery and recovery. While some platforms suggest donations starting at $50, truly any amount‚Äî$1 or more‚Äîhelps. If you‚Äôre unable to give, keeping me and my family in your prayers means a lot.

Thank you so much for your kindness and support.

I'm an independent auto damage appraiser (perito auto) running my own business in Italy. I work as a contractor (partita IVA - Italian VAT number/freelance status) directly for almost all major insurance companies operating here.
Our journey: We started as a small provincial office and have grown into one of the largest remote appraisal firms in Italy. We've adapted our business model to handle claims remotely, which has been a game-changer in terms of scale and efficiency.
I handle vehicle damage assessments, total loss evaluations, and navigate the unique Italian insurance landscape daily. I thought it would be interesting to exchange experiences and answer your questions about how things work on this side of the Atlantic!
Some topics I can discuss:
Building and scaling a remote appraisal business from scratch
How the independent appraiser model works in Italy (contractor relationships with multiple carriers)
Remote inspection technologies and methodologies we use
Managing a growing team while maintaining quality standards
The Italian claims process and its peculiarities
Working with different insurance companies simultaneously as an independent
Our ""constatazione amichevole"" system (amicable accident report)
Fraud detection in remote assessments
The Italian approach to liability and compensation
How we handle the abundance of exotic/classic cars and scooters
Dealing with Italian bureaucracy and paperwork (it's... an experience)
I'm genuinely curious about your questions! I love learning how the industry works in different countries, especially regarding remote appraisal adoption and scaling independent businesses. Whether you want to know about specific processes, technology, business growth, cultural differences, or just how we survive the Italian coffee-fueled chaos - ask away!

My husband died 7 months ago. Car accident. He was 33. We'd been married for 6 years.

His car has been parked in the same spot on the street infront of our house since the day before he died. Its a 2019 Honda Civic, nothing fancy, but it was his. He loved that car, always kept it clean, always parked it in the same spot.

I havent moved it. I know I should. The registration expired two months ago. It just sits there. But everytime I think about selling it or moving it or doing anything with it I just... cant. Its the last physical thing of his that still feels like him. His coffee cup is still in the cupholder. His sunglasses are still on the dash. Theres a grocery list in his handwriting in the console.

If I move it or sell it then its really real that hes gone. Does that make sense? Probably not.

Anyway. My neighbor three houses down, lets call him Rick, has been leaving notes on the car. Started about a month ago.

First note: ""This car hasn't moved in months. Please move it or it will be towed per neighborhood rules.""

I ignored it. We dont have an HOA. Hes just making up rules.

Second note, two weeks later: ""Abandoned vehicles are an eyesore and bring down property values. Move this car immediately.""

Third note, last week: ""This is your final warning. If this car is not moved by Friday I will call the city to have it towed as an abandoned vehicle.""

I lost it. Went to his house and knocked on the door. He answered looking all smug.

Me: ""Stop leaving notes on my husbands car.""

Rick: ""Then move the abandoned vehicle.""

Me: ""Its not abandoned. Its my husbands.""

Rick: ""I havent seen anyone drive it in months. Its abandoned.""

Me: ""My husband died. The car is staying where it is.""

His face changed a little but he didnt back down.

Rick: ""Im sorry for your loss but that doesnt change the fact that the car is taking up street parking and hasn't been moved. Other people need to park there.""

Me: ""Theres six empty spots on this street right now. Parking is not an issue.""

Rick: ""The registration is expired. Thats illegal. Im well within my rights to report it.""

Me: ""Then report it. But stop leaving notes on my dead husbands car.""

I left. Cried the whole walk home.

He called the city. Yesterday someone from parking enforcement came by and left a citation on the car. Says I have 72 hours to move it or renew the registration or itll be towed.

I dont know what to do. I cant renew the registration because the title is in my husbands name and sorting out the estate stuff is taking forever. I cant move it because I dont have the keys - they were with him when he died and I never got them back from the police evidence or wherever they are.

But also I just dont want to. I dont want to move it. I want it to stay there forever in the same spot like hes just at work and will come home and drive it again.

My sister says Im being unreasonable and I need to deal with this. That the car is just a car and keeping it there isnt bringing him back. 

My therapist says grief doesnt have a timeline but that Im avoiding processing by holding onto physical objects.

But Rick is still leaving notes. Yesterday's note said ""72 hours or Im calling the tow company myself.""

I sat in the car last night. Just sat in the drivers seat where he used to sit. It still smells like his cologne. I cried for two hours.

I know I have to do something. I know I cant keep the car parked there forever with expired tags. I know its not rational.

But he loved this car. And its the last piece of him I have that hasnt been sorted through or donated or packed away. Once its gone everythings really gone.

I dont know if Im posting this for advice or just to vent. Probably both. I just hate that this neighbor wont leave me alone about it. Like I get that technically hes right about the registration but does he have to be such an asshole about it?

Myhusband would know what to do. He always knew what to do.

I miss him so much.",74,1760447383.0,neighborsfromhell,83,0.89,False

Hi-Chew Hokkaido Special Edition
- Yogurt, Strawberry Milk, and Coffee Milk. The yogurt tasted more like a soda flavor. Others were fine. Coffee milk was like instant coffee. 

Regional Flavor gummies (white pouches)
- Hokkaido melon, Amaou strawberry, mango, and peach. There‚Äôs many more in this series from other prefectures that are good too! These are typically found in grocery stores in the candy aisle.

1o6f0ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/1o6f0ok/i_17m_am_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my/,I (17m) am thinking of breaking up with my girlfriend (17m),"Me (17m) and my girlfriend (17f) have been together a little over a year now. And things in our relationship have been going down hill for over half of that. She‚Äôs not seeming happy anymore, or for at least the most part. And it‚Äôs making me feel sad too. I‚Äôm finding that it‚Äôs making me more sad and stressed than anything else in my life currently, and my mates have said I seem sad around her.

Our intimate life is barely a thing, and has been for 8 months ish. She gets really angry with me for ‚Äúwanting to do stuff all the time‚Äù but we only seen each other once a week due to college and her parents. I feel like she anting to do stuff when we see each other is fine but I‚Äôm starting to doubt myself. She  also went through a phase of saying that she‚Äôs only doing stuff for me, which freaked me out loads and made it so that I didn‚Äôt wanna do anything for a while. When starting stuff I‚Äôm always the one to initiate, and it‚Äôs making me feel unwanted. She has also started saying recently after things that she wanted me to do the work as she dint have the energy to do anything, which has been making me feel horrible about doing things.

I‚Äôve been thinking recently about ending the relationship because of the way it‚Äôs making me feel. But I feel really guilty about it because of some of the things she‚Äôs saying. She‚Äôs said that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her only source of happiness‚Äù and the I‚Äôm ‚Äúher only friend‚Äù and it‚Äôs making me feel a little trapped in my own head because I‚Äôm scared of what she‚Äôll do and think if we break up. She‚Äôs also been asking for a lot of reassurance about us recently and it‚Äôs killing me saying that we are okay. I still love her, but i don‚Äôt feel happy anymore and it‚Äôs a huge deal for me as I‚Äôve had massive mental health problems in the past. I was wondering if breaking up is the best course of action, and how I should do about doing it? We are meeting on Wednesday for coffee so that‚Äôs my best chance to talk to her about things.",1,1760447246.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False
1o6f0gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1o6f0gw/feed_the_light_or_feed_the_dark_you_choose/,"Feed the light or feed the dark, you choose.","Long time lurker but never had enough karma to post, so here I am. I recently released after a streak of 120 days, so I write my experience as encouragement to all who may need it. 

I've been on this journey now consistently for a little over a year, I‚Äôve heard about this practice years ago when trying to quit PMO but could never commit because I had relationships. It took a breakup for me to truly commit to my inner growth.

I've had some long streaksI just did 120 days. I had 90 days before this one, and then I had a few shorter ones 30 days plus. What I have realized is that the benefits are definitely real. It's weird how real it is, because of how subtle, and not so subtle at times. It‚Äôs also so outlandish, that the average member of society would think you‚Äôre  fucking crazy if you told them about it. It's like Fight Club. You don't talk about Fight Club. 

The energy and the charge that it gives you to go into your life can be intense, you move differently, think differently and act with integrity, it gives you power to step into your authentic self, and fuels your mind. The energy forces you to act on what you need to act on, even if you resist it, eventually you‚Äôre left with no choice because the inner compass is finally operating at full capacity. The energy fuels your evolution. I've quit drinking coffee on this journey, and I have way more energy than I‚Äôve had in my entire life. 

I was 120 days in and then, you know, then I started looking at pictures of naked girls on the internet. I didn't masturbate or ejaculate. I was just looking. The next thing you know, I'm masturbating without releasing. Then give it a few more days. I went out for a few drinks on Friday night, and by Saturday night, I was edging again. But this time around, I released. What‚Äôs different is that I was fully aware of what I was doing, I told my self I wouldn‚Äôt release I was just enjoying some ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù.

At first, I felt terrible. Oh, no now I'm doomed to all the bad luck. I went to bed, and then the next day, I woke up and I felt tired and I felt depleted. I didn't leave the house. I even had a nap, and I'm not a napper. I realized that you can either feed the light or you can feed the darkness. It's up to you. It's your choice. ITS YOUR CHOICE. You can either pray to God and stay positive and reframe it, rather than looking at it like I've reset and I'm all the way back at the beginning again. You just look at it like, I've gone 120 days without releasing once. I dissipated some energy, and I shifted my hormones but I'm fine. I'm still magnetic. I'm still confident. I'm still happy. I'm still me. 

I have realized that all the negativity around that, all the shame, it's just a placeb-no. Alot of it is in your psyche. Yes, the benefits are real. You have increased your life force. Of course, you're going to feel great. Of course, you're going to be magnetic. Of course, you're going to attract people and good opportunities because you're full of life, full of vitality, full of masculine energy. Obviously, you're going to attract great things into your life. But just because you release once doesn't mean you lost all that masculine energy. 

All you can do is as soon as you fall off the horse, just get back on it and keep going, and reframe the situation positively. Compare yourself to who you where before you started this journey. Don't be hard on yourself. Don't be consumed by shame. What does shame do? Nothing. Just learn, and grow. You know, this is the longest I've went. The next time, I'll go longer. 

It's getting easier and easier. I don't want to do it, and my most precious prized possession is my sexual energy. The only reason why I kind of fell backwards is after I quit drinking coffee a few months ago, I started eating carbs again after being on a meat-based diet all year. So I sort of replaced coffee for carbs. And then that led to me, once in a while binge eating. But I still haven't been drinking coffee. Then I noticed when I was working six days a week when I had my one day off, I'd be watching too much TV and eating junk food. I'd be eating so much food that I wouldn't feel rested after my one day off. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with some financial issues because of a serious injury I had last year. I had to take 14 months off work to recover.I lost all my savings and investments and ended up with a bunch of debt. Recently I lost my job a few weeks earlier than I was expecting to. It set me back a bit, and that just made me really stressed. I know better but I was avoiding my feelings. The next thing you know, I'm lusting, I'm edging. So it's very insidious, it creeps up on you. The trick is when you notice the instinct to take just one little peek at something sexual, you need to put the foot down right then and there. I've really learned that lesson. It's that one little peek that is the demise. It's the beginning of the fall. There's nothing to be ashamed about. learn your lessons, gain your wisdom and get back up 
stronger.

I‚Äôve noticed that before I have a massive growth in my life ‚Äúthe pendulum‚Äù swings back a bit before it swings forward to gain more momentum. As your physical container expand to your new state of being that swing is much smaller and more manageable. 

I‚Äôve also noticed how the symbolism of the 7 deadly sins helps me act with integrity and reminds me of when I‚Äôm slipping. Awareness is the answer, not shame. 

Go easy on yourself, love yourself, forgive yourself and be kind to yourself. This increases your vibration. Shame, regret, sadness, anger and self hatred lower your vibration. Semen retention is all about increasing your vibration so help yourself if and when you do fall we‚Äôre all human so naturally it‚Äôll happen, be kind to yourself, and remember what you feed is what become.

1o6ez9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1o6ez9x/critique_my_daily_meal_activity_plan/,Critique my daily meal + activity plan,"44 year old male 5'9 @ 225lbs my guess is BF is 30-40% - Backstory below for those interested

My goal is to lose as much body fat as possible over the next year or two while getting stronger/used to a solid gym routine. I simply want to get lean again and feel youthful and healthy as I go into my late 40s.

Long time ago in my 20's I was 140 lb amateur boxer. Obviously over the last 15+ years I have been packing on the pounds and since have some issues with my knee and calves  
(meniscus and chronic exertional compartment syndrome) from when I over did it running a couple years ago at which point I dropped 70lbs but the injury set me back and I since put all the weight back on.

I started TRT (compounded cream) 100mg a day via scrotal application a few weeks ago as my total test was sub 200. Energy levels and motivation to get going have dramatically increased.

Daily activity consists of just a much higher NEAT than before including things like more household chores, lawn maintenance, wood stacking etc.  
I live near a beach and take my dog 5 days a week for a 5k walk this is about 6000-8000 steps in itself and depending on beach conditions is more difficult than walking on treadmill at home or other flat even surfaces. The other two days I take dog for a simple 1k walk so she can do her business (still at the beach)

\*I plan on adding a beginner push/pull split focusing on compound lifts but want to adjust to the new level activity before I add more. Thing is I want to be able to commit and realistically I cannot mentally or physically get into the gym 4-5x a week right now so I want to start with 2 days a week and as my body and mind adapt to the physical/mental routine add 2 more days etc.\*

As for daily nutrition I keep it as simple as possible as I really do not mind routine and eating same foods.  
I will start with supplements:  
\-Test cream 100mg/day  
\-Creatine 5mg/day  
\-Whey Protein Isolate 2 scoops  
\-Collagen/vitamin c/biotin 1 scoop a day  
\-Psyllium Husk 2 scoops a day  
\-Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega 2 capsules a day  
\-Allmax Essentials ZMX (Zinc,Magnesium, Vit B6) 3 capsules a day  
\-D3 1000UI 2 a day  
\-2 Coffees a day with sweetener + coffee mate

Breakfast:  
3 hardboiled eggs  
1/4 cup of 100% whole grain steel cut oats  
1/4 cup of high protein harvest crunch oats chocolate & almond  
Raisins + cinnamon mixed in with the above for flavor  
1/2 cup or so of blueberries

Lunch:  
Glass of water with Psyllium Husk  
Whey Protein Shake with no sugar almond milk  
If I am feeling hungry some days between breakfast and dinner I will have a small salad or a banana or some of my wife's left over rotisserie chicken

Dinner:  
250-300g of Chicken breast or ground beef or half a package of extra firm tofu  
1 Cooking onion  
2-3 gloves of garlic  
1/2 Red Bell pepper  
Sometimes Green onion + mushrooms  
I use variety of different spices to change up meals  
Sauces are usually soya/oyster with the once a week treat of curry spices with coconut milk  
(piece of naan on curry nights)

Occasionally if I am tired or not feeling like cooking I will have a big plate of salad(mixed greens + super seeds, cucumber, bell pepper, feta and low calorie dressing) or a piece of naan bread with homemade hummus and some blueberries/raspberries or banana

So that is pretty much it - Please have a look and let me know what you think I could add or eliminate to my average daily diet / supplement stack and why as I appreciate explanation.

As for my trt I am actually prescribed 200mg a day but decided to start with 100mg and can increase up in 25mg amounts if I so choose. Currently I am feeling good on 100mg and no real major sides besides feeling amped/anxious some days but with it being just 3 weeks in I am waiting to longer to see how I level out and might go up to 125 or 150.",1,1760447150.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.67,False

I've been actively trying to build a jwellery collection since I practically own nothing, hence so many pieces. If you have any particular pieces that you recommend under budget, please send links. Further, everyone on reddit keeps saying they're bad, but I've had a pretty good experience on the app, so this is a hear me out. üò≠

1. The necklaces:

‚ú®The gold rhinestone pieces are for layering. One is smaller and the other longer chain can be attached anywhere on itself and you can leave the rest of it dangling (would look amazing on something with a deeper cut). Looks super cool with the gold snake layered chain. Yes, I am going for the maximalist Pinterest girlie vibe üåù
There was also a matching bracelet, so i got that too. The stones are not very shiny so that it looks cheap, but they reflect light gracefully.¬†

‚ú®¬†The silver rhinestone piece will look lovely in theme with a square neck dress or something that shows off your collarbones. Also all the pieces have the perfect length. Not too long, not too choker-y. I once saw a piece like this irl, and regret not buying it every since, which is why I probably got it lol.¬†

I paid 143

‚ú® The snake layered chain by itself looks good too. But sadly, can't be separated. It's an everyday wear piece that just elevates the look but I wouldn't recommend wearing it everyday. üíÄ

I paid 139

2. The rings:

‚ú® The silver rings are way too big for my fingers. They are also not adjustable. I just got them because I liked a few pieces and don't generally like to layer rings, so i guess I only needed a few pieces. Also yes, as a set they look cheap.¬†

[link](https://sharein.savana.com/db/details/1868792?ub_cl=in_en-IN&vid=325&skcPGs=307625-407690%2C307626-407691)
I paid 172

‚ú® The gold set, has the exact opposite problem. They're tiny. Again not adjustable. This one was a impulse purchase.

‚ú® The chunky gold rings. Now this is what actually made me order off of savana and not meesho. I couldn't find this set anywhere. I love the pieces. Adjustable and beautiful. Sadly, they were NOT cheap.¬†

I paid 285

3. The waistchain:

‚ú® I have mixed opinions about this one. The silver suns are small. Like quite small. I can't tell whether I love or hate that. But it's pretty long and looks quite good when worn with a top. I wouldn't recommend buying this to wear with a skirt/jeans.¬†

I paid: 193

4. Bracelets + arm cuff:

‚ú® The flower bracelet did feel a little cheap irl, ngl. I'm also scared it's gonna break, which it probably will if you applied enough pressure.¬†

I paid 158

‚ú® The geometric bracelet is my favourite bracelet that I own. It's a little big on me but it's so beautiful and shiny. They also gave a free ring with it, lol.¬†

I paid: 173

‚ú® The arm cuff is minimalistic and looks good. But it is not size inclusive. Overall, I'd say you can absolutely wear this to a casual coffee date and not look too dressed up.¬†

I paid 142

Overall, had a good experience. Will buy more in near future. I've worn them about 2 times each, for roughly 5 hours each, they did not tarnish. But let's also keep in mind to be as careful as we can while handling them. They cost way too less to be anti tarnish. (Just to mention, I do sweat a lot and I've washed hands while wearing the rings, everythings still good tho.)¬†

Delivery wasn't much of a problem, especially considering I ordered during peak pujo season and the fact that Savana has a bad rep for not delivering on time/delayed delivery. Also weirdly, I've never bought clothes from Savana?! üò≠

1o6eynt,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1o6eynt/morning_hike_up_rattlesnake_ledge_washington_usa/,"Morning Hike up Rattlesnake Ledge, Washington, USA Fog, Solitude, and the Best Coffee I‚Äôve Ever Had","I finally decided to do a solo sunrise hike up Rattlesnake Ledge (near North Bend, WA) this weekend. I‚Äôve done this trail before with friends, but going alone at dawn was a totally different experience.

I started around 5:30 a.m. The forest was quiet except for a few distant owls, and the fog was so thick I could barely see ten feet ahead. For a while, I wondered if the view would even be worth it  but about halfway up, the light started breaking through, and everything around me glowed that soft golden color you only get for a few minutes at sunrise.

When I reached the top, the ledge was completely empty. No crowds, no chatter, just the sound of wind moving through the trees below. I pulled out a thermos of coffee I‚Äôd packed and just sat there watching the fog roll off the lake as the sun came up. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it was one of those moments that felt bigger than it looked  like everything was still, and you could finally breathe again.

On the way down, I passed the usual morning rush  people talking loudly, dogs barking, music playing  and I realized how rare it is to actually have a trail to yourself, even for a short while.

If anyone‚Äôs planning to hike Rattlesnake Ledge, I highly recommend doing it super early (and bringing coffee). Just watch your step on the way down  those rocks get slick when the fog lingers.

1o6ertj,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarKid/comments/1o6ertj/little_details_i_noticed/,Little Details I Noticed,"Spoiler warning for TGWDLM:R! 

So I watched the revamp and I have a LOT to say about it, my overall thoughts is it‚Äôs a very impressive show but it being performed on this scale completely erases the feeling that it‚Äôs a normal small town suddenly confronted with something wildly abnormal to the point it‚Äôs scary, which was my personal favorite part about the og. I also miss the vibe that it was taking place on a spaceship from the og set, as cool as the new set is 

BUT! That being said I think it‚Äôs way more fun to talk about things we DO like and there‚Äôs a ton of that too, so here are some of my favorite small details I noticed while watching!! 

- I love Ted wheeling into the office scene on a chair, and the way he‚Äôs sort of humping Paul‚Äôs leg like a dog while he does his borat impression. I‚Äôm sure Melissa wouldn‚Äôt agree 

- While Emma and Zoe are having their vocal rest moment, Nora is pocketing tips from the tip jar. I really like this little detail, I think they leaned more heavily into her being a terrible boss this time and it works great 

- Also the menu in Beanies! Super cool and I love all the references on it, like the caramel drizzle mud and mung bean frappuccino. Also the ‚Äúfudge clivesdale mocha‚Äù is awesome 

- Barry going ‚Äúthat signs bullshit. THE SIGNS BULLSHIT!!!‚Äù As he leaves 

- Peter!!! I love seeing him haha. Also the way he high fived his friend for tipping so they‚Äôd get to see the ladies dance again, such a teenage boy thing haha (pretty sure he‚Äôs 15 in this show?) 
Side note does anyone know who his friend is 

- Paul RUNNING back on stage because he thought of another point for his argument with the greenpeace girl 

- Speaking of cameos, la dee da da day was awesome, I love seeing Frank, Max, Ruth and Barry again. As the world‚Äôs only Frank/Barry shipper this made specifically me happy lmao. Max in particular was really tickling me, his dancing was so in character even though the hivemind part was still obvious, just looked like Will was having a blast which I love. Also when he left he was flexing and went ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs got muscles! :D‚Äù 

- Also in la Dee da, I REALLY like the changes to the homeless man! The new choreo works really well and made him even more unsettling, like when he leaned in as if he was going to bite Paul‚Äôs face

- The coffee machine scene now also having a water cooler is fun! Also Ted is pretending to listen to Bill while on his phone lmao

- MR. DAVIDSON. This might be my favorite change so far, what do you want Paul was FANTASTIC and so much fun. I loved all the new choreo and how intense Davison was being, especially with physically pulling Paul around by the tie and wrapping the phone cord around his neck. I also audibly laughed when he was doing the ‚Äúmaybe someone who keeps you lusting‚Äù line and tracing the body shape and Paul screamed ‚ÄúTHATS TOO MANY‚Äù 

- Another Paul delivery I ate up is when he leaves the office and talks about how he needs to wake up with coffee, he adds on a last ‚Äújust a cup of black coffee, that‚Äôs whatyouregonnahave!‚Äù 

-Nora and Zoe felt even scarier during CORC/COPC, they killed it 

- When listening to Dan and Donna, Hidgens can‚Äôt resist a little ‚Äúbleugh‚Äù when they mentions Clivesdale 

- Paul: excuse me, Professor?
Hidgens: stares 
Paul: ‚Ä¶.ugh‚Ä¶

- Speaking of Hidge, I know people are divided on Will‚Äôs performance but I personally really liked it. Hidgens is introduced as ‚Äúkooky and reclusive,‚Äù of course he‚Äôs going to be strange and off and not act in the same ballpark as all the other characters  

- A general detail I really loved throughout the show is how everyone‚Äôs getting beaten up during the songs!! I think it was really cool and added an extra level of danger and panic, plus some of the moves were really fun (like Paul and Emma‚Äôs heads being smacked together in SMYH and Charlotte twisting Ted‚Äôs finger in JUAD) 

- Join us and die was AWSOMEEEE holy shit Jamie killed that and the new choreo is so cool. Also the shot of them dripping in glowing blue and moving robotically in sync was so chilling. Again I loved the beating up in this number it was so good. And so fun to watch with things like our main cast being thrown over couches and pulled this way and that

- Ted‚Äôs reaction to charlottes death was HEARTBREAKING dude. He reaches out for her when she gets shot, then stands staring at her body for most of the scene, before sitting down on the stairs and alternating between looking at her and crying. Similarly their breakup scene hit harder, they both seemed way more upset and Ted was fighting tears as he ran off 

- Also I think charlotte breaks Ted‚Äôs finger, or at least twists it during JUAD, and for the rest of the scene Joey holds it bent and favors his other hand 

- Related to the last one, Joey‚Äôs background acting might have been my favorite part of this whole show oh my god 

- Another general detail I liked is how much the coworkers all cared about each other in this version. Even Bill and Ted and constantly trying to help or at the very least check in on each other after they get hurt, which adds another layer to the stakes of literally everything that happens

- Not your seed felt so much more tender this time, I feel like it was sang as more of a heart to heart between father and daughter and things like bill holding her arms while she sang were absolutely shattering. Also the girls handing Bill the gun to try and convince him to shoot himself was CHILLING. And then after he dies, Paul isn‚Äôt even listening to the pokeys he‚Äôs just like hovering over Bill :(((

- Show Stoppin‚Äô Number did a callback joke to Mr. Davidson tracing too many curves on a body haha 

- In AIGA Paul actually notices Ted and looks sad for a second :(

- I didn‚Äôt write this one down so I can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôm making it up, but I‚Äôm pretty sure when Paul says ‚Äúhe wanted to be choked by his wife! While he jerked off!‚Äù The other aliens glance at Davidson 

- ‚Äúwe will not be resisted‚Äù being a sung line was really cool 

- Colonel Schaefer breaking character to talk about Peanuts is adorable, I overall liked this character more this time 

- inevitable was SO GOOD, I loved the smashed together sets from the rest of the show paralleling the mashup, some of the new choreo was really great (let me puke in your mouth, Em dip >>>) 


And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for now, but we‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs anything else in the proshoot! I think everyone involved should be immensely proud of this show and how it turned out, it‚Äôs such a spectacle ",9,1760446637.0,StarKid,1,1.0,False

My VP was impacted but not my direct boss (as he sat in a different office). I still don‚Äôt understand what happened. 

Despite us having a rocky professional relationship he really claimed to have liked me personally. He went on vacation (with his wife, mind you) and bought me a gift and when I went to visit the team in an offsite he went out of his way to see me, take me out to coffee and drinks and even asked to go to karaoke afterwards with the team.  Even when I was being laid off he told me to reach out if there is anything I need and that it was a pleasure working with me. 

Jump forward 4 months, I saw a role that I genuinely was interested in. I took him up on his offer and reached out to him because he has a wide network and knows people personally at that company. He told me he‚Äôd help and asked me to send my resume and the job description. The next day however.l, I got a rejection email from the company for the exact role I was inquiring about. 

This feels weirdly suspicious and I could be overthinking it because there‚Äôs clearly some unhealed wounds. But is there any chance he sabotaged my chances of even getting an interview or is it just a coincidence? I just find it so shady that as soon as I reach out to him about a role I get the rejection email. How would you perceive this?  And can I reach out to anybody at the former job or just move on??

This used to be scheduling, being fr I‚Äôd open my laptop, notes everywhere, coffee next to me full study mode setup and then somehow end up cleaning my desk, checking one random notification or falling into a 45-minute YouTube same loop about productivity itself. It was like I was constantly getting ready to study but never actually studying. I‚Äôd tell myself, ok from tomorrow I‚Äôll be serious, then tomorrow would come and I‚Äôd start with just 10 mins on my phone that turned into an hour.

I tried everything from long to-do lists that looked pretty but were impossible to finish, Pomodoro timers that made me feel rushed, waking up at 5am for two days straight before crashing back into noon wakeups. Some days I‚Äôd be super strict and plan every minute, other days I‚Äôd just wing it completely. And by the end of the week I‚Äôd feel burnt out, behind and weirdly guilty for not doing enough. It was exhausting.

Then I realized I didn‚Äôt really have structure¬† I was just relying on motivation that came and went. So I started small. I used Notion to plan just 3 main things per day and yea no aesthetic layouts, no extra fluff. Then I synced it with Google Calendar so my phone would actually remind me when to start. I also tried Calendy for setting small study sessions with friends so I couldn‚Äôt bail last minute.

A few weeks in, I found Jolt screen time that literally LOCKS¬† distracting apps when I start a focus session - honestly, that alone saved me from the endless Instagram ‚Äújust checking‚Äù loops. Pairing that with Calm during breaks helped me reset instead of doom-scrolling.

Now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve cracked the code or anything, but I‚Äôve stopped calling myself lazy. I just needed a rhythm, not guilt. I still have off days, but at least now I know why I‚Äôm off track instead of thinking something‚Äôs wrong with me.

For us, Nepal was the latter ‚Äî a land where adventure met serenity, where friendship deepened into something more, and where every sunrise seemed to whisper a new promise.

It began in **Kathmandu**, a city alive with color and chaos, prayer flags fluttering like dreams in motion. We wandered through **Durbar Square**, hand in hand, our laughter blending with the bells of ancient temples. The golden glow of **Swayambhunath** at sunset wrapped the city in magic ‚Äî and for a moment, time felt beautifully suspended.

From the city‚Äôs rhythm, we drifted to **Pokhara**, the peaceful heart of Nepal. Mornings began with coffee by **Phewa Lake**, where the reflection of **Machhapuchhre** shimmered like a secret between the clouds and the water. Days were filled with small adventures ‚Äî a gentle trek to **World Peace Pagoda**, a boat ride at dusk, and that unforgettable moment when we soared together while paragliding above the valley.

I still remember the way the wind carried her laughter ‚Äî wild, free, and fearless. Somewhere between the sky and the mountains, I realized that adventures are best shared with someone whose soul feels like home.

Then came **Chitwan National Park**, where the wilderness whispered softly at dawn. We rode into the mist on elephant-back, spotting rhinos and deer as the forest slowly awoke. At night, under a thousand stars, we sat by the campfire ‚Äî the air filled with stories, silence, and the warmth of something unnamed yet deeply felt.

But it was the **Himalayan trek** that changed everything. The path was steep, the air thin, and yet we moved forward ‚Äî encouraging each other with every step. When we finally reached the viewpoint and saw the first light of day kissing the snow peaks of **Annapurna**, we stood side by side, silent but connected. The world stretched endlessly before us, and in that stillness, love felt both fragile and infinite.

Nepal wasn‚Äôt just a destination ‚Äî it became a part of our story. A place where friendship turned into love, where nature mirrored our emotions, and where we learned that the most beautiful journeys are the ones that transform you inside.

When we left, we carried the scent of incense, the echo of prayer wheels, and a thousand quiet moments that words could never capture.

Because sometimes, you don‚Äôt just visit a country ‚Äî you fall in love with it.

1o6ebba,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaTravel/comments/1o6ebba/crown_sydney_appalling/,Crown Sydney Appalling,"Just trying to share information, as reviews seem to be hidden and unavailable for public to see.

We stayed at the Crown Hotel in Sydney for a weekend getaway with the family, and was met with a delay of over 1 hr to check in as the room was getting cleaned and needed to have a second inspection. We went into the room and the photos I have attached, show what state the room was in..

We found used cotton buds on the floor. Grime build up on the sink, coffee stains on the bench. The hotel did not respond to our service requests from within the room to assist with luggage down to the foyer. Not did they assist us with having a fast checkout.

There was a smell of bad odour on the pillows and to top it all off the bed was extremely uncomfortable.

This is meant to be a 6 star hotel but felt lower quality than a 3 star service. The only redeeming quality was the beautiful view of Sydney.

We have stayed at many much cheaper hotels who have provided much better service and a cleaner room.

I am not sure why my review hasn't gone live from 5 days ago but these stories should not be hidden. It's important to raise awareness to the hardworking people here in our country. Your hard earnt money is better off going to any of the lovely 5 star hotels in the area.

1o6e7fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o6e7fx/aio_for_insisting_on_celebrating_my_birthday_on/,AIO for insisting on celebrating my birthday on my birthday?,"My (35F) husband (37M) flew to Las Vegas with his friends from college as part of a bacherlor party weekend on Friday (10/10). My birthday is today (10/14). He isn't the best man or part of the wedding party, just a close friend from college with the groom, and they have remained friendly but not besties or anything. When he got the invitation a few months ago, he worried about the expense, since Vegas these days is like $10 for a cup of coffee, but he worked out a budget and it seemed to be reasonable. I was less concerned about finances and more worried about the fact that he'd be getting back the day before my birthday. 

Before we got together, he wasn't ""a birthday person."" He was born on New Years Day, so growing up his parents were just never home on his birthday. When he was a child, they flexed his birthday to the weekend after his birthday. After he started high school they just stopped celebrating and told him he was too old for it. 

When I first started dating him, he told me this and I thought ""That's so sad!‚Äù So, that year, on New Years Day, I threw a big birthday / NYE party. At midnight, instead of saying ‚ÄúHappy New Year‚Äù, everyone screamed ""Happy Birthday!"" I brought out a cake. We sang happy birthday. Since then, we go out for a nice dinner on New Years Eve, we count down at midnight and watch the ball drop, and then I shout Happy Birthday instead of happy new year and have cake and presents. 

My birthdays are not as thought out. He forgot the my birthday the first year, which I understood given his family history and he'd just been promoted and immediately saddled with a major project. He did make it up to me with a weekend to Mexico in the new year. Since then, we always have a nice dinner at his favorite restaurant and presents that are things we both like. 

Recently, my sister Sue (40f) pointed out that we go to my husband's favorite restaurant and he buys us things to do together instead of something that shows he truly knows me. We always go to his favorite steakhouse, which I don't complain about because I do like steak. It's just not my favorite food. (That would be French.) And he usually gets me tickets to concerts we both want to see or activities for us to do together. And it's never really bothered me until this year. Now, Sue is NOT my husband's biggest fan. When I told Sue about it, she said it *should* bother me. She said to me, ""Every birthday, he gives you the bowling ball."" 

I laughed then, but it‚Äôs been gnawing at me since, ngl.

So, when he confirmed three months ago that he'd be going on this bachelor party weekend and flying back the day before my birthday all I said was ‚ÄúWill we still be able to celebrate my birthday on that Tuesday? Like, is okay to ask you don't drink on the travel home day? So we can have a nice dinner and drinks for my birthday, which is the next day?‚Äù 

He got frustrated and asked if I thought he was an alcoholic or something? He said it sounded like I didn‚Äôt trust him. ""Yes, of course,"" he said. He wouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to board drunk on an airplane. Of course we‚Äôd still celebrate on my actual birthday. 

He stumbled in last night, still drunk. He said it's nbd. All of his friends were drinking all weekend, including the boozy brunch and on the airplane for the flight home, and he took an uber home so it's not like he drove drunk. It was just how the weekend went. What could he do? 

I think he could have, you know, NOT kept drinking on the day he was traveling home. Not gotten on an airplane drunk and kept drinking. (Also, I thought they weren't supposed to serve drunk people on airplanes?)  Unless they were literally pouring booze down his throat, no one was ""forcing"" him to drink, he chose to do so. 

This morning, he‚Äôs still in bed and not going to work. He‚Äôs been up all night puking. He's massively hungover So obviously, no birthday for me today. I‚Äôm furious. My over hungover husband says I‚Äôm being immature. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just celebrate tomorrow. You‚Äôre like a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum.‚Äù He says it's an overreaction to not just flex my birthday to another day. (Related: I haven't seen anything in the house that would indicate he even got me a present, so either he's gotten really good at hiding things, or he COMPLETELY forgot this year, and I'm not even ""getting the bowling ball."")

I think I only ask him for one thing, to celebrate my birthday with me on the day, and he prioritized partying with his friends for four days over three days with them, sober up for one, and then have a nice night with me. I didn't even want him not to go. I just wanted him to not be hungover on my birthday. I don't think that's unreasonable.  I think his behavior just shows doesn't know me or care about what is important to me, that I will always come second to his friends and having a good time.

Hello everyone,

Thank you for taking a moment to hear my story.

My name is Ayla. 25 years old and  a third-year engineering student . Until recently, I balanced full-time studies with a full-time caf√© job on minimum wage, and I‚Äôve always tried to give back when I could.

My life changed after my father‚Äîour family‚Äôs breadwinner‚Äîpassed away. I‚Äôm now helping my family survive: my two sisters and my younger brother depend on me. Because of everything happening, I haven‚Äôt been able to study or work for the past four months.

I‚Äôm also facing serious health challenges. I urgently need high-risk spinal surgery. Screws from a previous operation have shifted into the middle of my spinal canal and are putting my spinal cord at risk‚ÄîI‚Äôm terrified of becoming paralyzed. The pain is severe and even basic tasks‚Äîlike bathing or making coffee‚Äîare difficult. In addition, I have cervical neck disc problems and loss of kyphosis in my neck, which worsen my symptoms and daily function. I also have celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder) , severe anemia, all of which complicate treatment. Several surgeons have declined due to the risk; I need a team with the right technology and expertise.

I don‚Äôt have public health insurance here; as a foreigner in T√ºrkiye, I‚Äôm not covered and must pay out of pocket. 

I‚Äôm humbly asking for your help to fund my surgery and recovery. While some platforms suggest donations starting at $50, truly any amount‚Äî$1 or more‚Äîhelps. If you‚Äôre unable to give, keeping me and my family in your prayers means a lot.

Thank you so much for your kindness and support.

With gratitude,

### **About Euc**
‚Äç
**We‚Äôre making good health last a lifetime**
‚Äç
More than 1 billion people globally live with obesity ‚Äî a major leading indicator of many preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
‚Äç
**Eucalyptus** (or 'Euc' for short) is the company behind Juniper**,** one of the world‚Äôs largest weight management programs combining GLP-1 medication with a tailored nutrition and exercise programme, supported by our multidisciplinary care team. It is also behind a growing family of digital healthcare clinics (Pilot, Kin, Software, Compound) across men‚Äôs health and well-being, fertility, skincare, and preventative health. These clinics create one ecosystem designed to make good health last a lifetime. üåø
‚Äç
Our published clinical research on Juniper demonstrates that patients in our program are 4x as likely to lose significant weight through their course of treatment. For our other clinics, we apply the same evidence-based philosophy of combining medical science, personalised care, and behavioural insights to improve patient outcomes**.**
‚Äç
Since launching, we‚Äôve grown fast to support millions of patients. In the last 12 months‚Ä¶
  * Globally, grew revenue by >130% YoY, while reducing cash burned by 90% YoY, with over $100M USD raised from global investors such as BOND, NewView, Blackbird and Airtree (early backers of companies like Canva, Stripe and AirBnb)
  * Grew to over 100,000 monthly active patients globally across our weight management program
  * Grew from 4,000 to ~40,000 patients in the UK, and received selective NICE endorsement to provide service to the NHS
  * Tailored our offering to over 5,000 patients in Germany and Japan, with a goal to extend our patient base to over 30,000 patients across both markets in 2025


‚Äç
##### **What‚Äôs next?**
‚Äç
Our goal for the next 3 years is to be supporting 1 million patients globally - to live better for longer - by launching into new conditions, demographics and geographies as we move towards our vision of creating a preventative healthcare ecosystem.
‚Äç
We‚Äôre going to build the world‚Äôs largest international digital healthcare company. This will be really hard to do, but very rewarding and possibly, the adventure of a lifetime with some of the best operators you will ever work with.If that gets you excited, let‚Äôs talk.
‚Äç
‚Äç
### **About the Role (What you‚Äôll be doing)**
‚Äç
You‚Äôll join the **Product Growth team** for **Juniper Australia,** responsible for **Conversion, Retention, and Cross-sell.** Your copy will drive these metrics whilst building patient trust across every patient touchpoint: landing pages, purchase pages, emails, questionnaires, program pamphlets, in-app content, etc.
‚Äç
This isn‚Äôt just about writing fast or writing pretty. It‚Äôs about writing **copy that performs** - built on insights, backed by testing, and aligned with our mission to make healthcare accessible and _human_.
  * **Own conversion copy across key patient touchpoints** from webpage to onboarding to long-term retention
  * **Translate complex health topics into hyper-clear messaging** that builds trust and drives action
  * **Spot and fill gaps in persuasive arguments** (identify where we need to source testimonials, statistics from new research, expert quotes, etc.)
  * **Synthesise real patient insights** (interviews, reviews, research) to shape persuasive, patient-first messaging
  * **A/B test your work** and optimise it using data and best-practice techniques
  * **Ensure consistency in tone, narrative, and brand messaging** across channels and formats
  * **Collaborate closely with design, lifecycle, product and growth teams** to shape and scale the patient experience
  * **Unlock your time** by building AI into your approach


‚Äç
**What's next?**

Description: # Head of Marketing Analytics & Measurement, AU
_Healthcare is usually slow and boring. We believe in its potential to be exciting and entertaining. But changing the healthcare experience is hard ‚Äì and we‚Äôre gonna need all the help we can get‚Ä¶!_
**About Eucalyptus**
**Eucalyptus**(or 'Euc' for short) is an Australian founded digital healthcare company that is on a mission to solve the world‚Äôs biggest healthcare challenges - think fertility, and behavioral change around chronic conditions such as weight loss, diabetes, and mental health.
Founded in Australia in 2019, we have now helped over 500K patients globally by combining technology, design and operational excellence to help patients access the best clinical support when they need it - wherever they are.
Our 4 brands (Juniper, Pilot, Kin & Software) focus heavily on personalizing the experience for different demographics and are powered by a growing team across 5 countries (Australia, UK, Germany, Japan, and the Philippines).
We‚Äôve raised over AUD$150M in funding from Aussie and Silicon Valley investors who were early backers of Uber, Canva and AirBnb. With plans to launch into several more markets, offline channels, and tackle new conditions.
We‚Äôre looking to continue building our team of executional weapons who are passionate about healthcare, aren‚Äôt afraid to work hard, and invest in others through direct and honest feedback. This approach enables us to make the most impactful changes to improve the health of millions of patients globally.
**About the role (What You‚Äôll be Doing)**
We‚Äôre hiring a **Head of Marketing Analytics & Measurement** to lead how we track, analyse, and improve our marketing performance across all brands and markets.
This is a senior, hands-on IC role for someone who blends **marketing intuition** with **analytical precision** ‚Äî a measurement architect who understands how performance media really works, and how to make it work better.
Your job is to give our global marketing teams the clarity and confidence to spend better.
You‚Äôll design and own our global measurement framework ‚Äî from attribution and incrementality to MMM, test design, and dashboarding ‚Äî so we can spend smarter, reduce waste, and improve contribution margin across markets.
This means:
  * Setting the global measurement strategy for paid, owned, and earned channels
  * Building and enforcing attribution standards across AU/UK/DE/JP
  * Overseeing our tooling stack ‚Äî GA4, GTM, Looker, BigQuery, Paramark, MMM, Metabase
  * Owning relationships with analytics partners (e.g. Paramark, geo-testing vendors)
  * Collaborating closely with performance and conversion marketers to embed best-practice testing and measurement
  * Writing and maintaining playbooks ‚Äî so we learn and improve systematically
  * Supporting strong signal health (CAPI, UTM, server-side tracking, etc.) in partnership with our Head of Analytics and engineers
  * Building and maintaining dashboards (or guiding those who do) to give execs and marketers visibility into what matters
  * Advising on media planning and channel allocation with data-driven recommendations
  * Providing thought leadership on incrementality, lag effects, cohort analysis, and contribution-based metrics


You‚Äôll work as part of the **Global Performance team** , reporting to the **Global Head of Performance** , and collaborating with performance leads, creative strategists, local growth teams, and data/engineering partners.
This is not a role for someone who just pulls reports. This is for someone who can build the measurement infrastructure that drives smarter decisions ‚Äî and make our marketing meaningfully better.
**About you (Who you are)**
You‚Äôre an analytical leader who knows marketing ‚Äî and a marketing leader who knows analytics.
You understand how spend turns into results, and how to design systems that uncover what‚Äôs truly incremental. You‚Äôre comfortable working across teams, across markets, and across messy data sets ‚Äî and you bring the rigour, curiosity, and communication skills to make complexity actionable.
You‚Äôll likely bring:
  * 8‚Äì12+ years in marketing analytics, measurement, or data strategy roles
  * Fluency in SQL and experience building dashboards (Looker, GA4, Metabase, or similar)
  * Experience setting up or managing MMM models (e.g. Paramark, Google Meridian, in-house regression)
  * Knowledge of geo-testing, holdouts, brand lift, and other incrementality tools
  * Strong understanding of attribution frameworks ‚Äî including their limits and tradeoffs
  * Experience partnering with performance teams to improve CAC, LTV, and conversion
  * Confidence building and communicating data models to non-technical teams
  * Experience owning analytics tools and implementation (GTM, GA4, CAPI, etc.)
  * Bonus: Experience in DTC, health, or regulated categories
  * Bonus: Experience with cross-market orgs (EU/UK/AU/JP) or complex media budgets


**How we think about marketing**
At Euc, marketing is about capturing attention and turning it into real growth. We‚Äôre not here to chase perfect CTRs or vanity metrics. We‚Äôre here to grow the business ‚Äî by finding where our audience is, grabbing their attention, and telling stories that drive action.
We move fast. Really fast. Because when ideas ship quicker, we learn quicker. We make bolder bets. And we don‚Äôt waste months on ‚Äúsafe‚Äù campaigns that never move the needle.
  * Creative wins. We don‚Äôt have exclusive access to channels, so great storytelling is how we stand out and earn attention.
  * Speed matters. Fast tests beat perfect plans. We ship early, learn fast, and move on.
  * Ad buying is problem solving. Whether it‚Äôs fixing a leaky funnel or finding the next unlock ‚Äî curiosity is our superpower.
  * Fit matters. A good idea needs to match the channel. We tailor stories to the format, and we‚Äôre ruthless about what we let run.
  * Data is a compass. We ask why, not just what. Trends > daily swings. Insight + action = impact.
  * We focus on outcomes, not channels. If Meta works, we scale it. If TV works, we shift spend. No channel loyalty. Just growth.


If you‚Äôre excited by the challenge of turning 1 AUD into 5 AUD ‚Äî and doing it across 5 brands, 4 countries, and millions of customers ‚Äî this is the place.
**Why you should join Euc**
  * **Our teams are incredibly passionate** - Our talent bar is high and our work ethic is strong. You‚Äôll get to stretch yourself everyday and work amongst people who care deeply about our patients. You‚Äôll be given autonomy to tackle interesting problems and receive regular feedback from a supportive team.
  * **We move at incredible speed** - You‚Äôll work with team mates who build in the open by sharing their work freely, this helps us learn and iterate quickly so we can deliver high quality outcomes faster than our competitors. You‚Äôll spend a lot of time outside of your comfort zone learning and iterating frequently, we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
  * **We will invest in your career** - You‚Äôll get access to an annual professional development budget, mentors and buddies to ensure that you have the support you need to level up. You can expect regular performance and pay reviews as your career grows.
  * **We are all owners** - You‚Äôll be given equity to ensure that you are able to benefit in the upside of your contribution in helping Euc grow. Your ideas will be valued regardless of your role, you will have ownership over the projects you work on which will feel both terrifying but extremely fulfilling.
  * **We play as hard as we work** - From our annual Eucalympics (Olympic themed decathlon), monthly health & fitness allowances, free weekly barista coffees, funded social clubs, quarterly rooftop parties and weekly catered fireside chats, we know how to let our hair down!
  * **We‚Äôll have your back when you need us the most** - You‚Äôll be able to lean on a range of leave offerings to support you when needed, this includes: personal health and professional development leave, a generous parental leave that offers 20 weeks paid leave for a primary carer, additional miscarriage leave (see more on Kin Fertility‚Äôs #WeNeedMoreLeave campaign), as well as our Employee Assistance Programe.

1o6e0ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1o6e0ue/passed_the_phr_on_a_throwaway_first_attemptmy/,"ü§Ø Passed the PHR on a ""Throwaway"" First Attempt‚ÄîMy Experience + Tips [N/A]","So¬†I mostly felt that my test experience was like Kevin Malone and him eating broccoli¬†for the first time. He knows it's¬†gonna be a crappy¬†experience but he's gotta do it. But he makes the experience even harder for himself by eating the stem first, ""this is a new food for me."" Lol, what an idiot. But this idiot isn't alone, he's got friends. Me. My ""stem first"" version was not studying for 5 months b4 the test. Not something that is generally recommended. Add-in halfway through the¬†test my bladder was about to burst b/c I drank too much liquids the¬†am of the test (FYI, you can't take bathroom breaks. At least for virtual exams) and I also had to drop a loaf. So I busted out of my office after the test to go to the bathroom. In the middle of it I get an email about something¬†to do with a PHR badge. I was like, WTH?! and saw my results were available. It was like a starting gun went off and I was racing for the triple crown. I think I made it back to my desk b4 I fully buttoned my pants. While I waited for the site to load¬†I thought through again what results I expected, about \~50% score,¬†but I did have a new found hope. Somehow, I read ""PASS"". Unreal.¬†

Anyways, I figured I'd share my strange experience and some takeaways to hopefully give others a little extra hope and perspective, especially those who don't have a traditional HR background and/or procrastinate.

**My Non-Traditional Background**

* Experience: 10+ years exclusively in recruiting (agency and big tech).
* HR Knowledge: Limited to zero general HR experience outside of the laws and regulations related to hiring and recruiting.
* Education: BA in Accounting¬†
* Test-Taking Style: I believe I have fairly effective test-taking skills. I‚Äôm not generally an over-thinker on test answers (I.e. I only flagged 2 out of 115 questions for review).

**The Study & ""Throwaway"" Plan**

I applied for the test when they ran a deal for a free ""2nd Chance"" insurance‚Äîbest decision ever (If you can, absolutely wait for these promos. I got¬†mine in the Spring,¬†they might do a fall one, too). My application was nearing its 6-month expiration, and since I had the safety net, my plan was simple: take the test, fail it, use the 3-month cool-off period to *actually* study, and take the second attempt seriously.

My Study plan (May 2025): I studied for about 1 month, 1‚Äì2 hours a day. Then, life got in the way and I stopped. Besides what I listed below, I believe I took one practice test on pocket prep (scored somewhere around 70-80%) and also one with PHR for Dummies (think I scored between 50-60%).

\-- Pocket Prep Premium: 75% of my study time; Completed 836 questions; 755 correct / 81 wrong

\-- PHR for Dummies: 15-20% of my time; Good for core concepts

\-- Quizlet: 5-10% of my time; Quick review of terms.|

Five months later‚Äîwith zero recent studying‚ÄîI sat for the exam and, somehow, passed.

**Key Takeaways: Prep Material vs. The Actual Test**

The most important difference I noticed was that the actual test questions felt easier than the questions in my study materials. The exam was more high-level and situational.

* Study Materials: Some of my studying focused on rote memorization like *‚ÄúThe FLS Act (FLSA) of 1938 established that 'blank"" and ""blank"" was now precedent. True or false?‚Äù* (These were often more difficult for me.)
* Actual Test: Focused more on *‚ÄúWhat is the best way to approach this situation as an HR professional?‚Äù* (These were generally easier.)

You need to know the concepts, but your success depends on applying them to choose the most appropriate and ethically sound HR action. There may be multiple *right* answers, but generally you're asked to find the best one for the scenario.

**Day Of: Remote Testing Tips**

I took the test online. I actually almost missed my original appointment (or what I thought was my original appt time) because I didn't fully complete the sign-up/check-out process after picking a date (a small but confusing UI moment on the scheduling site‚Äîmake sure you get to the final ""Submit Order"" screen and get a confirmation email!).

* System Check: I highly recommend running the system test via the HRCI site and OnVue the day before.
* Desk Setup (What worked for me): Laptop, charger, one unplugged monitor, bag under the desk, and a plain white coffee mug on the desk. This was all acceptable‚ÄîI wasn't flagged for anything.
* Check-In: The ""check-in"" button presented itself 30 minutes before my scheduled time on the HRCI website. Follow the prompts for the room scan.

**Test-Taking Strategy (IMO - most vital to my success)**

My main strategy boiled down to a complete comprehension of the question and a process of elimination of the answers.

1. Understand the Question (The Real Battle): This is critical. For many questions, half the battle is truly understanding what is being asked. I often read questions 2 or 3 times, focusing on every word choice. For \~10-20 questions, my understanding of the question *actually changed* after several readings.
2. Process of Elimination: Once I understood the question, I read all the answers. I made a mental note of my ""gut feeling"" answer. Before selecting it, I tried to eliminate ones that didn't seem to fit. If my gut answer was still viable after the process of elimination, I stuck with it. And generally it was still viable.
3. Trust Your Gut: I only felt more confident then not in about \~25% of the answers. The rest I was either somewhat confident or 50/50 (I believe due to my recent lack of studying). I don't think there were any questions I felt like I was truly guessing on,¬†though. Overall, I believe trusting my initial gut feeling and being decisive helped my odds of passing. I only flagged 2 questions for me to review at the end and I didn't use the extra time I had to 2nd guess my answers on any other questions (had about 50 mins to spare)
4. Format: Most were multiple-choice. My test had a handful¬†of fill-in-the-blank questions, all requiring a number or calculation, not a term/name.

**Final Advice/Thoughts:**

1. Even if you study months ahead of time with no recent study opportunities, you may still retain a lot. Use your first attempt (if you get the 2nd chance insurance, **again highly recommend waiting for the free promotion**) to see where your¬†knowledge is and what gaps you have (view your results afterwards for each category). And who knows, you may end up passing.¬†
2. Trust Your Understanding of Yourself: For me, this meant acknowledging my gaps outside of recruiting and hiring (when I did study, I focused my studying in other¬†areas), but also knowing that my previous record of being a fairly effective test-taker meant I didn't need months of intense preparation.
3. Problem-Solve Each Question: Focus on fully comprehending what they're asking in the question, eliminate any answers you can, and listen to your gut.
4. The 2nd Chance Insurance is Golden: It‚Äôs also a double-edged sword (it made me not take the first attempt *too* seriously), but knowing I had the safety net was incredibly calming and it further encouraged me to not overthink my answers. I went into the test relaxed and could put my best effort forward without fear of failure.¬†

Feel free to ask any questions. Happy to share more about my experience if it can be helpful. Would love to hear other's experiences, too. Good luck, y'all.",2,1760444609.0,humanresources,0,0.67,False

Is it unreasonable to expect a bonus relationship to not be complicated?  I mean by nature there are inherent complications by default, communication apps, logistics, fallout, secrecy, lying, schedules, expenses etc.  And all of that is just part of this adventure.

Hit it & Quit it people don‚Äôt factor in because they know what they want and if you can‚Äôt recognize that from pretty much day 1, then you are probably fucked‚Ä¶.literally then ghosted.

 

What I mean is: the great connections, excitement, mutual understanding, patience, something to look forward to, the up front talks/chats about expectations, availability, what you are looking for, why you do this, getting to know each other, being raw and honest and uninhibited, laughing, coffee dates, stolen phone calls, messages, eventually naughty and nice, ya know‚Ä¶.the good stuff.

Then when everything is going about as amazing as possible, no suspicion at home, happiness, first meets all the way to  9,876 meets,  feeling alive again, finding ‚Äúthe groove‚Äù,  life at home is great as well because there is no pressure on your marriage for intimacy so with that cloud lifted you get along better, moods are improved, OPSEC A++ on both sides, etc. you are like finally I found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and this is how it is supposed to be in an affair.



Then BOOOOOOMMMMMMMM.  They didn‚Äôt message back instantly, I must not be a priority, they are treating me like an AP and I feel used, well fuck them I‚Äôm gonna match energy and play emotional and communication chess, I love you, I can‚Äôt breathe without you, my entire life revolves around you, I want to run away together off into the sunset, what would life be like if we had met sooner, well he/she/kids must must be more important than me and now I know you don‚Äôt value me like I thought, I got curious and scrolled socials and now I‚Äôm intimidated, pissed, self conscience, inadequate, so much hotter than your spouse, no I don‚Äôt sleep with my spouse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that much,  oh, you didn‚Äôt respond in 36.9 seconds..ok, I‚Äôm gonna go scroll ads and find your replacement because you obviously don‚Äôt have time for me and I‚Äôm worth it,  your job was busy, your kid was sick, it‚Äôs your anniversary, birthday, vacation‚Ä¶.FUCK all that, how can you have a life without me, I am your AP, I should be the only thing you ever think about and the only thing that makes you happy.



I love you, I hate you, I‚Äôm horny, I miss you‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs ok if I‚Äôm busy, but how come you didn‚Äôt message me 20 times while I was living my actual life outside of adultery.  I can‚Äôt do this anymore, it‚Äôs too hard, it too easy to find someone new, it‚Äôs now boring, it‚Äôs now more work than my actually marriage, it‚Äôs run its course, these things never last.  I told my friends, spouse, etc because I was lonely and felt guilty, etc.

This is all rhetoric that happens, but you know why‚Ä¶because we took something that was so fun and fulfilling and exciting‚Ä¶..and made it complicated then act shocked when the other person doesn‚Äôt want to share their crayons or legos anymore.  KISS Keep it Simple (Sexy, Stupid,etc)



It can be simple and amazing if you remember what this is, and not try to make it something else,  but your worst enemy can be the one in the mirror just as easily.  It's ok to say NO and it's ok to ask for more, but when you aren't asking, you are just getting....that's when you have found the good one and embrace it for as long as it lasts and enjoy each other while you can.  Be reasonable and honest, but changing the dynamics mid affair is never a good idea.  And any of us who have done this a time or 2 know that it is amazing until it isn't, and when it isn't it is no longer worth it, no matter how amazing you think you are.  We are all selfish or self preserving at some point.

Know your worth but also know your place‚Ä¶. Depending on which side of this coin you are on, greatly impacts the experience.   Happy Fuckery My Friends!",11,1760444400.0,adultery,15,0.76,False

I‚Äôm about to show you how I turned everyday Amazon product reviews filmed in my living room into over ‚Ç¨12,000 in passive commissions ‚Äî without ads, a fancy camera, or a massive audience.

My first month‚Äôs payout? ‚Ç¨7.  
Now, videos I filmed months ago are still making me money while I‚Äôm cooking dinner or chasing my kids around the house.

**The Strategy That Actually Works**

Forget all the ‚Äúyou need a big following‚Äù nonsense.  
Here‚Äôs the truth: Amazon doesn‚Äôt care how many followers you have ‚Äî it cares if your videos help customers decide what to buy.

I started reviewing the stuff I already owned: my coffee machine, my tripod, my kid‚Äôs toys.  
Each video is 45‚Äì60 seconds max. Clear, honest, useful.

Now, those videos appear right on the product listings ‚Äî where thousands of shoppers are already ready to buy. That‚Äôs how you make commissions while you sleep.

**My Upload System**

* 1‚Äì2 videos per day. Consistency beats aesthetics.
* All EU storefronts. Spain, France, Germany, Italy, UK ‚Äî same videos, five times the reach.
* Pick high-traffic products. Not random items ‚Äî things people are already searching for.

The more videos you upload, the more Amazon starts pushing them into carousels. Suddenly you‚Äôre getting paid for sales in five countries ‚Äî without leaving your house.

**The Numbers So Far**

2025 earnings: **‚Ç¨12,000+** (and climbing)  
Average daily commissions: **‚Ç¨30‚Äì‚Ç¨70**  
Videos live across **5 marketplaces**  
Paid ads: **‚Ç¨0**  
Tools used: ChatGPT + Capcut + Canva + Coffee

**The Guide That Breaks It All Down**

I wasted 2 months trying to figure this out - you don't have to.¬†

I‚Äôve put everything into one step-by-step guide ‚Äî how to get approved, what videos to film, how to upload to all EU storefronts, and how to land free products and brand deals once your videos start taking off.

It‚Äôs not theory. It‚Äôs my exact process ‚Äî the one that‚Äôs currently paying my bills.

**The Reality Check**

This isn‚Äôt an overnight thing.  
The first few weeks felt like I was filming for no one.  
Now, months later, I'm earning someone's 9-5 paycheck passively (up to 2k/month).

If you want quick dopamine hits, scroll TikTok.  
If you want passive income that stacks, start uploading.

**The Invitation**

I‚Äôm not gatekeeping. If I can figure this out between school runs and editing videos on my phone, you absolutely can too.

The sooner you start, the better ‚Äî Amazon‚Äôs rolling this program out across Europe fast, and those early videos are the ones that keep paying long-term.

1o6dwmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1o6dwmr/audio_from_hell_the_studio_recorded_more_than/,Audio from Hell ‚Äì The Studio Recorded More Than Music.,"This is a story that my friend, Nicholas (a pseudonym), told me about something he experienced about 15 years ago when he was working at a recording studio in Manhattan.

I've compiled the details he shared, and I'll write it in his voice.
At the time, even though I was only working as an assistant, I dedicated myself to assisting a Senior Engineer for about four years.

Once I had learned all the ropes, the Senior Engineer asked me if I was ready to become a Staff Engineer.
To work as a Staff Engineer, I had to be able to handle all recording tasks alone.

It wasn't until I could manage everything‚Äîfrom meetings with the band to setting up, recording, tracking down, and the final sound adjustments‚Äîthat I was considered fully competent.
To judge my ability, I had to take on a trial recording session.

Naturally, as someone still half-trained, I couldn't be in charge of recording a famous, skilled band.

I was assigned to an amateur band, preferably one that was not highly skilled.
It was a three-person amateur band of college students who made a reservation.

They wanted to record two songs as cheaply as possible and in a short amount of time, as it was their first time.

It's not a nice way to put it, but from the studio's perspective, they were a band we could afford to ""fail"" with.
I became the one in charge.

The recording was scheduled for two days, including the mix-down.
On the day of the session, after a brief meeting, we immediately started setting up the drums and bass, and the recording began.

The college students were reasonably competent, and the recording process went smoothly.
It happened while we were recording the guitar.

The guitarist stopped playing mid-performance and asked,

""Didn‚Äôt you just hear a woman‚Äôs voice?‚Äù
In recording, we essentially never speak to the person performing during a take.

Also, the voices of me, the engineer, and the other members waiting in the mixing room don‚Äôt reach the performer‚Äôs headphones unless we press a talkback button.

Of course, no one was speaking at that moment.
The guitar was being played in a small room called a booth, sealed by a thick door, so no external sound could get in.

I checked the recorded sound, but since there was no sound resembling a voice, I told him, ‚ÄúIt must be your imagination,‚Äù and we continued recording.

Since certain guitar effects can actually produce sounds similar to a human voice, I didn‚Äôt worry about it at all.
The guitarist mentioned a few more times afterward, ‚ÄúI really feel like I heard a voice,‚Äù but the other members and I just dismissed it as his imagination.

Despite all that, the guitar recording was completed without issue.
All that remained were the lead vocals by the guitarist and the chorus parts by the other members‚Äîbut here we ran into a problem.

We generally try not to record vocals across multiple days to avoid shifts in vocal quality mid-song, but the session time ran out just as the vocalist couldn‚Äôt quite nail the first song.
However, the remaining time was just one day tomorrow, including the mix-down.

So, I made a proposal to the members.
Fortunately, we had several takes of the vocals recorded.

I suggested that since I would already be compiling the best parts and correcting any pitch issues, we should start with the second song‚Äôs vocals tomorrow.
Most recording engineers use a tool called Pro Tools, and with this tool, you can fix not only pitch and rhythm issues but virtually any kind of error.

The college band members looked a little frustrated, as they couldn‚Äôt afford to spend too much money, but knowing they‚Äôd incur extra fees if they didn‚Äôt finish in one day, they reluctantly agreed.
After seeing the members off, my all-night work began.

I thought to myself, ‚ÄúIf I can finish in about three hours, I can probably get five hours of sleep,‚Äù as I made myself some coffee and started fixing the vocals.
The work progressed more smoothly than I expected, and just as I finished fixing about half the song, I decided to take a break and tidy up the studio a bit to clear my head.

I was tidying up the cables in the booth and vacuuming when I thought I heard a woman‚Äôs scream, muffled by the sound of the vacuum cleaner.
I immediately stopped the vacuum.

The studio, where no external sound could enter, was enveloped in a silence so deep it hurt my ears.

I waited quietly for a while, but I didn‚Äôt hear the woman‚Äôs voice.
Just my imagination‚Ä¶ or am I working too hard?

That‚Äôs what I thought.

And just as I was about to return to the mixing room from the booth, the song we recorded today suddenly started blasting out at a deafening volume.
‚ÄúIt must be a glitch,‚Äù I thought.

Even though the sound was supposed to be routed only to the headphones, a blaring noise was coming from the main, large speakers.
All the recorded audio data was stored on the HDD.

I saved the data periodically while I worked, but if the data were to be erased, that would be the worst-case scenario.
I rushed to the PC and pressed the stop button.

The song didn‚Äôt stop.
The college students‚Äô song, which I had heard countless times today, kept playing.

I repeatedly pressed the stop button, but the song wouldn‚Äôt stop.

In fact, the PC stopped responding to any operation whatsoever.
I briefly considered turning off the power, but I couldn‚Äôt risk deleting the data.
As this was happening, noise began to mix into the song.

Mixed with the upbeat melody, I heard a ‚Äúzzzz‚Äù sound, like an old radio, and a high-pitched ‚Äúclank-clank‚Äù sound, like metal being struck.
‚ÄúThe whole system might have truly crashed‚Ä¶‚Äù
Just as I started thinking about giving up everything and shutting down the power,

a woman‚Äôs shriek‚Äî‚ÄúAAAAAHHH!‚Äù‚Äîrang out at such a loud volume that it drowned out both the song and the preceding noise.
The woman‚Äôs shriek assaulted my frozen body repeatedly.

The speakers were making a cracking, distorted sound, as if they were about to break.
And then, from deeper within the woman‚Äôs shriek, I heard a child‚Äôs voice: a genuine, heart-wrenching crying sound, like ‚ÄúWAAAH!‚Äù
Next, I heard the sound of many adult men letting out a deep, guttural yell, like ‚ÄúWOOOAAAAH!‚Äù
Standing frozen, I imagined people running away from some enormous catastrophe.
Looking back now, I feel like this is the kind of audio you might capture if you placed a microphone in hell.

It was exactly the sound of countless agonizing screams the studio mic had picked up, as if connected to the darkness in the very depths of hell.

How long had passed?
It probably wasn‚Äôt even two minutes, but the screams, like cries of agony, gradually faded, and the original upbeat song by the college students returned.
This time, the song stopped normally when I pressed the stop button.
Dazed, I only pressed the data save button and decided to just get out of the studio and rest in the office break room.

In the break room was another Senior Engineer who was also staying overnight to work.

The Senior Engineer took one look at my face and asked,

‚ÄúDid you lose some data?‚Äù
My face must have been extremely pale.
I told the Senior Engineer about the horrific, agonizing screams I had just encountered.

The Senior Engineer said,

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing particularly known about this studio, but recording studios in general, not just this one, somehow have a lot of ghost stories.‚Äù
Indeed, I had also heard rumors about ghost stories at a famous studio in Los Angeles and Seattle.
Afterward, the Senior Engineer stayed with me in the studio, and somehow I managed to do the minimum necessary work until morning.

Despite all the horrific screaming, there was no anomaly in the audio file, and the second day of recording was completed without any problems.
Looking back now, perhaps something had already begun to transfer onto the audio file from the moment the guitarist said on the first day,
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just hear a woman‚Äôs voice?‚Äù
Ultimately, the truth remains unknown.

But I realized that such phenomena can happen whether a place has a history or not.
It‚Äôs impossible to truly convey those agonizing screams in text, but they were truly terrifying.
This was the first and last experience of its kind, but due to overworking myself with consecutive all-nighters, I ended up breaking down physically and quit before becoming a Staff Engineer.

I returned to my hometown and am now working in construction.
Now that I‚Äôve talked about this experience from about 15 years ago, it makes me wonder:
