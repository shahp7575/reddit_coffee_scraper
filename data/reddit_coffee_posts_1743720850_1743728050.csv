1jqzbvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jqzbvq/im_constantly_hearing_my_parents_having_sex_what/,"I’m constantly hearing my parents having sex, what do I do?","This is going to be long and will most definitely contain unnecessary details and seem ranty so please bear with me. 

For the past 3 years I've been hearing my parents having sex from time to time (average of 3-4 times a month, depending on whether they're arguing or not). I'm a 14-year-old female and I live with my 8 year old brother and 12 year old sister. Our house is very open with our rooms and bathrooms being the only closed off spaces. I also have perceptive ears so it's hard to not hear it. 

I can hear moans from my room and creaks it's very unsettling and given my very anxious personality paired with some other mental disorders I can not handle it. I usually sit there and cry in my room silently so I don't wake my sister who's room is right beside mine. I have tried knocking and yelling to stop and that I'm scared but they got mad at me for it. 

I think the main trigger from this is one time when I got up earlier than the family and I was finishing a puzzle on the dining table which is about a yard or two away from my parents room. My dad was awake and making coffee, he gives me a kiss and goes to his room where I assumed he was going back to sleep. No in fact he went to go fuck my mom full on knowing I was right there. It was so inconsiderate. All I did was sit there and cry. When my mom came out looking relaxed she asked me what was wrong as if I wasn't there the whole time. I didn't let them hug or touch me for a week or two. 

Similar incidents like that have happened leading me to refuse embrace and physical contact with anyone married or a adult (parent's friends, teachers, etc.) when I would hug or touch them I would feel so filthy and when I got home I would scrub my body until I was red.

I have told them about this fear, they bought a white noise machine and deactivated time limits for Spotify so I can blast my ears when I hear them. However, they never turn on the machine and it's hard with my good ears and only one earbud (the other broke). If they see me upset about it they will get pissed saying, ""I don't know why it matters so much to you"" and, ""it's normal for married people, it's not your business"". 

I know they're married but I feel so disgusting, utterly horrid and alone when I hear them. I can usually sense when they're going to have sex that night. They will litteraly say, ""I'm going to go hang out with Mom"" and go to bed way too early together. When I hear them I want to cut myself to distract me from the sounds. I don't because I don't want my parents to worry. I have begin to blame myself saying it's a punishment from God for whatever sin I'm aware of committing that week. 

The next day I'm awkward and avoid talking to them. When they ask me if something's wrong I say I'm tired and couldn't sleep. I try to drop subtle hints but I know they're not going to help at all. 


I don't know what to do. They don't care, I can't move out I'm 14 for goodness sake. I can't ask my siblings because I don't want them to go through what I'm going through, my friends understand it's normal and don't pay any mind. I honestly am asking for help. I don't want to hurt myself to cope and my therapist just brushed it off. Please help.

1jqzbed,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Due_Bowler_5666/comments/1jqzbed/manifesting_is_instant_but_is_not_what_you_think/,"Manifesting is instant, but is not what you think it is.","Waiting is a feeling. You can think of it as a state of transition. You wait for your order in a restaurant, you wait to get your hair cut, you wait for everything when doing 3D world stuff.

One of the things that I realized when I started using my imagination to assume my wish fulfilled was that  I was getting there faster the more I practiced. 

One day, out of the blue, a thought came to me, ""What if instead of waiting to feel fulfilled, I stop waiting?""

So that's what I did. I removed the waiting in my imagination and just went straight into the fulfilled feeling.

This left me quite surprised. The wanting and waiting were actually the same thing. Like if they were entangled.

Our minds want the desire and are waiting to have it so that they can become the you who has it.

If you can catch yourself in that state of doing a technique but waiting for your manifestation, just remove that waiting feeling.

You'll realize that what you're seeing in your imagination IS your desire being fulfilled at that moment.

You're instantly manifesting the version of you who has it.

Try it right now. 

Whatever your desire is, just imagine yourself having it now, remove the waiting, and see what happens.

If you did it correctly, you'll be left with your desire fulfilled, and the waiting will not be there.

You'll be in the state of wish fulfilled.

Why does this work?

Because we won't accept being fulfilled without the thing in the 3D. 

But to have it in the 3D, we need to stop waiting for it and have it first. See the paradox?

Removing the waiting made me manifest a lot of things almost instantly in the 3D. It will not always work that way, but it will put you on your wish fulfilled much faster.

Some of you ask me if you could buy me a coffee for being helpful. If you want, you can donate to me here [https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666](https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666). I'll probably use it to bring food to a stray dog shelter nearby.

Setting: Unknown

Date: Thursday, May 4th, 1995?



(Alex groans as he wakes up, sore from the fall, and pushes himself up off a damp carpet. An odd, chemical stink clinging to his body. Alex looks around him and notices John sitting cross-legged not too far away from him, staring into the bizarre room they’re both sitting in. Sickly yellow wallpaper peels from the wall, stained with damp patches. Above, buzzing fluorescent lights fill the silence with a maddening drone. The lights continue to flicker erratically, casting distorted shadows that creep, and lurch along the floor.)



(John looks over to see Alex sitting up. He stands up immediately, walking over to him as relief creeps onto his face.)



John (steady): Glad to see you didn’t crack your skull open. We both know you can’t afford to lose any more braincells.



(Alex attempts to stand, wobbling slightly, but John quickly moves over to give him a steadying hand.)



Alex (groggy): Don’t worry, I’ve got a backup plan for when I’m too far gone. You adopt me. I get your insurance, and your child gets a handsome, but slightly dysfunctional older brother.



John: How about I just keep you as a pet instead. I already have the kennel, and I promise I probably won’t leave you in a hot car.



(Alex lets out a laugh. The moment softens the edges of panic lingering beneath the surface.)



Alex: Seriously though… where are we? I’ve woken up in plenty of strange places before, but none of them smelled this much like mold and despair.



(Alex grimaces, noticing a slick sheen of a mysterious liquid coating his hand. He wipes it off on his pants in disgust.)



John: Must’ve fallen into some sub-level beneath our office. Though, I can’t figure out how we survived a fall like that.



(Suddenly, a blur falls from above, smashing into the carpeted ground with a loud thud. Alex jumps, instinctively. His adrenaline spiking.)



Alex (startled): Jesus…



(They edge towards the fallen object… It’s a coffee mug, lying sideways with steaming liquid pouring out of it. Staining the grimy carpet a deep brown as it spreads. Bold letters printed on it spelling out “World’s Best Dad.”)



Alex (looking up): There’s no hole up there… Where did this thing come from?



John: No clue, Alex. Just keep your eyes up ahead. Every second we panic is a second we lose finding a way out.



Alex: You’re right John… I always thought if we were in a horror movie I’d be the cool guy with an axe. Turns out I’m just the one holding the flashlight and shaking.



(They cautiously proceed through the winding corridors, cluttered with random office items. A chair wheel, torn folders, and even a white board that still smelled freshly of marker. Turning a corner, they halt abruptly, eyes fixed on the same thing. A chair, half-submerged into the carpet, spasming violently. Its outline distorts, glitching rapidly. Its shadow trailing behind oddly, seemingly delayed behind its movements.)



Alex (unnerved): What is that?



(He glances at John, who stands rigid, fingers gripping his own arms so tightly his knuckles whiten. Noticing Alex's stare, John quickly regains his composure. Like a mask slipping back on.)



Alex: John, you ok?



John: Just… don’t get near it. Whatever’s wrong with that chair… could happen to us too.



(Alex steps back from the thrashing chair, but notices something off at the end of the hallway. Barely visible in the flickering shadows, stands a figure. Its form ripples unnaturally. Alex immediately recognizes it as the same entity that shoved him down here in the first place.)



Alex (voice trembling, stepping back): No… it’s here.



John (spinning around): What’s here?



Alex: That thing. The one that pushed me down here.



(But by the time John looks, the figure is gone. No trace it was ever there. Just more empty hallway.)



John (carefully): Where at? I don’t see anything.



Alex (hesitates): I… never mind. It could’ve just been a shadow.



(John narrows his eyes, and opens his mouth to speak, before stopping himself.)



John: You’re not alone. This place has a way of messing with your head. Just focus on what’s ahead of us for now.



(They continue down the hallway. Alex looks behind him again, the figure still gone from where it was once standing… But there’s a lingering sensation. Like the cold tendrils from before were again brushing against him. Alex visibly shudders before shaking off the feeling.)



(John suddenly freezes. His arm flies out. Gripping Alex’s shoulder to stop him.)



John: Quiet. 



Alex: 

What’s-



(Alex is cut off by John covering his mouth. Before Alex can speak again, he hears it. The sound is faint, but distinctly different from a human. The sound of its feet stepping on the wet carpet resonates through the hall, with each powerful step it takes.)



(John grabs Alex by the hand, pulling him into a crevice in the wall. Outside the sound of the creature’s approach continues, until it stops in front of them. The sound of it sniffing the nearby air reverberates through the hallways. Followed by a low, deep growl that shakes them to their core. Alex and John hold their breath, waiting for whatever is out there to pass by.)



(The creature’s breath rasps inches away from their faces. It comes in slow, ragged gasps, like it was choking on each inhale.)



(After what seems like an eternity, it starts to walk again. The footsteps retreating in a slow, deliberate way. But it wasn’t leaving quietly. A screeching noise fills the air, its claws now tracing along the wall as it walks down the long hallway away from them.)



John:

We’re not waiting around here. 



(John stares down the hallway where the creature vanished, jaw clenched. Then shakes his head.)



John: Let’s move. I’m not sure what’s going on, but I don’t want us anywhere near that thing.



Alex (shaken):

No arguments from me. Just lead the way.



(The two continue down the winding yellow corridors, the creature’s footsteps fading behind them. Alex looks towards John, about to speak before he freezes. Faint whispers. He can’t make out the words through the loud drone of the lights, except for one. His name. Whispered softly, like a lover in a dream. Alex shakes it off, determined not to let this place break him quite yet.)",1,1743727698.0,backrooms,1,1.0,False

and I'm tired of having to minimize it for fear of being accused that I'm faking it or just boasting.

Ever since I got pregnant all I ever saw online and in real life was vile negativity around motherhood (although it's much much worse online).

I write this partly as a rant to vent and partly hoping to ease the concerns of women who, like me, read these things online when pregnant and are terrified of making the worst mistake ever. If I could go back in time, the only thing I'd do different is to not read anything about parenthood and pregnancy on online forums. And stay away from people in real life who desperately want to scare you that it will suck or want to see you say you regret it.

These are just some of the things I read and heard, so that they lead me to believe these are universal experiences. It turns out they're not:

""pregnancy is scary/dangerous and will ruin your body"". I had a perfectly uneventful pregnancy despite being of ""advanced maternal age"" as they call it. With the exception of some nausea in the first trimester, which my OB promptly handled with a prescription, the most annoying part was peeing a lot during the last trimester. I did not have any health conditions beforehand and I didn't develop any during or after. It went by fast and I didn't turn into a monster. In fact my skin looked the best it ever did in my life with not a single breakout in sight and my hair was thick and luscious. Plenty of women have this same experience.

""delivery will hurt the worst you've ever felt in your life and you will likely DIE OR BE INJURED FOREVER"". I was so terrified of delivery mainly due to what I read online that I had begged my OB for an elective c section. But I went into labor spontaneously and something in my gut told me to just do it. So I got the epidural instead and guess what, I've had migraines that were so much more painful than delivery was. I pushed for thirty minutes and the baby was out. I had a minor first degree tear that healed in a week. I experienced no urinary incontinence or any other issues after and I didn't even get a single stretch mark.

""pregnancy and delivery will ruin your body and age you"". This is deeply misogynistic bullshit and completely untrue. If you take care of yourself before and during pregnancy, chances are you will look the same after sooner or later. And if you don't right away, well you did the most badass thing a human can do. You deserve grace and are beautiful just the way you are and you can do things to make yourself feel even better. I feel more confident than I ever did before in my life after doing this. I am 15 lbs overweight now at 6 months postpartum but guess what, this is not the first time in my life I've gained weight and I can lose it again once I stop BF. Nothing else has changed, I don't look haggard and I haven't aged any more than I normally would in this time. Sorry folks, but a lot of aging is genetic and also the habits you had before getting pregnant will impact it far more than just pregnancy. I've used sunscreen and retinoids religiously for years before getting pregnant and my skin looks just as good now. I still have time to slather on sunscreen before I go out.

""you won't be yourself anymore"" Not sure what this is even. No one is the same person throughout their whole life. I still have the same values and goals but now I also have a tiny person that I love more than life itself baked in there. My baby actually gives me so much more motivation to be even better than I used to be to set an example for them.

""you won't have time to yourself/for hobbies/to travel"". I was surprised to find out that if I was just a bit strategic about it, I had enough time to myself. I could do my hygiene routines, take a walk, have a coffee, do a hobby. Granted, I have a great husband who is an equal partner but that is part and parcel of the groundwork you need to do before having a baby to make things easier on yourself later. Choose a great partner ladies, and try to be close to family (of origin or chosen) even if they don't always say the perfect thing. Let the small things go if you want help from the ""village"". Also, you can make time if you stop doomscrolling all the time (guilty of this myself). Maybe you can't go to rock climbing anymore for a bit? Pick up a guitar or a paintbrush and do a hobby you can do from home. And if you can't, you won't die because you didn't do something for a year. It's just a season, it goes by so fast. You will do the thing again, it's not forever. And you can absolutely travel with a child but if you're not comfortable, you will travel again when they're a bit older. Again, it's just a season in life, I'm sure you didn't travel internationally three times a year when you were 18 and you lived.

""you will never sleep again and will have PPD, PPA etc."" I've always had the propensity to be anxious and mildly depressed at times so I was extremely concerned of developing PDD. To my surprise I did not at all, in fact my pregnancy and postpartum have been some of the most mentally peaceful times of my life. If it happens, there are resources available to help you but don't consider it a forgone conclusion (like I did).

Sleep has been rough at times but we take turns with my husband and try to figure out ways to give us both rest. It's not the first time in my life I'm having rough sleep (doing a Master's while working was rough, some stressful periods at work have been rough too) and I knew I will survive the rough nights and sleep again. And I was right because since the baby turned four months he's been waking up only once at night to feed. If anything, now I fall asleep the moment my head hits the pillow because Im forced to cut down on bad habits like scrolling while in bed.

All this is to say, the parts of motherhood I found the scariest have been nowhere near what I imagined. And the one part I could not had imagined no matter what I read was how much I would love my baby and how my heart would nearly explode with love and joy as I sat there feeding them at 2 am. And how confident and sure of myself I would feel during this surreal experience, even at times where I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. Don't fall for the fearmongering and if you love motherhood, do it loudly and unapologetically.",0,1743727553.0,BabyBumps,0,0.5,False

Here's the brutal truth.,"Alright, so a few weeks ago ago I had this idea for a Scrabble-style game and thought ""why not try one of these fancy AI coding assistants?"" Fast forward through a sh\*t ton of prompting, $417 in Claude credits, and enough coffee to kill a small horse, I've finally got a working game called LetterLinks: [https://playletterlinks.com/](https://playletterlinks.com/)

**The actual game (if you care)**

It's basically my take on Scrabble/Wordle with daily challenges:

  \- Place letter tiles on a board

  \- Form words, get points

  \- Daily themes and bonus challenges

  \- Leaderboards to flex on strangers

**The Good Parts (there were some)**

*Actually nailed the implementation*

I literally started with ""make me a scrabble-like game"" and somehow Claude understood what I meant. No mockups, no wireframes, just me saying ""make the board purple"" or ""I need a timer"" and it spitting out working code. Not gonna lie, that part was pretty sick.

Once I described a feature I wanted - like skill levels that show progress - Claude would run with it.

Ultimately I think the finished result is pretty slick, and while there are some bugs, I'm proud of what Claude and I did together.

*Debugging that didn't always completely suck*

When stuff broke (which was constant), conversations often went like:

Me: ""The orange multiplier badges are showing the wrong number""

Claude: *dumps exact code location and fix*

This happened often enough to make me not throw my laptop out the window.

**The Bad Parts (oh boy)**

*Context window is a giant middle finger*

Once the codebase hit about 15K lines, Claude basically became that friend who keeps asking you to repeat the story you just told:

Me: ""Fix the bug in the theme detection

Claude: ""What theme detection?""

Me: ""The one we've been working on FOR THE PAST WEEK""

I had to use the /claude compact feature more and more frequently.

*The ""I found it!"" BS*

Most irritating phrase ever:

Claude: ""I found the issue! It's definitely this line right here.""

*implements fix*

*bug still exists*

Claude: ""Ah, I see the REAL issue now...""

Rinse and repeat until you're questioning your life choices. Bonus points when Claude confidently ""fixes"" something and introduces three new bugs.

 *Cost spiral is real*

What really pissed me off was how the cost scaled:

 \- First week: Built most of the game logic for \~$100

 \- Last week: One stupid animation fix cost me $20 because Claude needed to re-learn the entire codebase

**The biggest ""I'm never doing this again but probably will"" part**

Testing? What testing?

Every. Single. Change. Had to be manually tested by me. Claude can write code all day but can't click a f\*\*\*ing button to see if it works.

This turned into:

 1. Claude writes code

 2. I test

 3. I report issues

 4. Claude apologizes and tries again

 5. Repeat until I'm considering a career change

**Worth it?**

For $417? Honestly, yeah, kinda. A decent freelancer would have charged me $2-3K minimum. Also I plan to use this in my business, so it's company money, not mine. But it wasn't the magical experience they sell in the ads.

Think of Claude as that junior dev who sometimes has brilliant ideas but also needs constant supervision and occasionally sets your project on fire.

Next time I'll:

1. Split everything into tiny modules from day one
2. Keep a separate doc with all the architecture decisions
3. Set a hard budget per feature
4. Lower my expectations substantially

I sat down to do some “light studying” (aka reorganize my entire Notion dashboard for the third time this week), opened 27 Chrome tabs, made a suspiciously over-engineered cup of tea, and realized... something was missing.

Not motivation. That ship sailed weeks ago.  
Not snacks. I had those locked and loaded.  
It was *vibes*. I was vibe-deficient.

So I did what any highly distracted remote worker/online student/fake-deep creative would do — I opened YouTube and typed in “lofi beats.”

👎 Too jazzy  
👎 Too anime girl repeating the same loop since 2016

So naturally I said, ""Fine, I’ll do it myself"" (yes, like Thanos but with FL Studio and too much reverb).

1jqyxi6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqyxi6,A Quick Love Letter,"Hi PEI! Long time lurker, first time poster here. Wanted to take a quick second and share some pics and memories from my favorite province/island. I’ll add some context to the pics and random thoughts below:

1.) This was taken back in Oct ‘24. First time back on the island in ~20ish years. One of my parents is from Canada (NB), so we’d spend a week or two on the island and visit family growing up.  All of that to say, beyond being objectively the best, the island has a truly special place in my heart.

2.) The bridge! Still scares me…but I’ll take that over the ferry any day. I’m probably just being dramatic, but that boat made the LOUDEST NOISE when it hit the dock/thing that made it come to a stop. Having seen titanic, I was completely convinced the ferry would somehow end up split in half.

3.) Finally. 

4.) Some quintessential essentials. *** I realize, especially now, lays may be a controversial choice. I recognize Humpty Dumpty as a quality option, but I need my tastebuds to be assaulted by ketchup flavor so…I apologize for me sins. Coffee crisp is unrivaled though 

5.) The Mecca of punny shirts and ice cream. The most recent obsession was either mooey gooey or wowie cowie…something like that. Either way, this establishment has cumulatively taken years off my life, and I’m forever grateful. The last time around, a lot of the shirts seemed to be direct pop culture references, and maybe I overlooked it…but I miss when it would say something like, “common cow seeks greener pastures” and has the cow in a thematic setting. 

6.) Red rocks (Bedeque) 

7.) The Starlite Diner isn’t usually this blurry. But if I had a dollar for every time I asked someone to play “you ain’t nothin but a hound dog” on the jukebox…I’d have enough for one bridge toll!

8.) Coastal cliffs (Bedeque) 

9.) I THINK this used to be the Village Store. Could be wrong on the name, but it was this awesome convenience store where you could pick your own candy and get little paper grab bags of assorted sweets. All the essentials, movies for rent in the back room (I think). We’d go get soda (pop) in glass bottles…back when they had “rewards” under the cap like ‘you win a free soda’. Give me a kinder egg and a pop and I was a happy kid for hours 

*if that IS the village convenience store, shout out to the lady who used to walk her leashed cat on Callbeck St. that always blew my mind, and was a staple of our vacation. I hope you’re doing well, the trend has really caught on. Someone owes you a bunch of that indestructible/colorful money, eh? 

10.) The spuds, my buds (from the bright red mud). This is from the potato and antique farm machinery museum. One of my prized possessions, albeit it a little weathered.

11. & 12.) I wish I could spend the rest of my life here. I try to explain to people how amazing it is, but neither words nor pictures do proper justice 

13.) the stairs from the  Bedeque cottages my family has rented, dating back to the 90s, down to the beach below. 

13.) I love the island AND its inhabitants. Always have! Some ladies and I dish at Cavendish Beach 

***********************************
Couple other super quick things:
**********************************

- Finally getting to ride Cyclone at Sandspit was one of the happier moments of my childhood. 

- Honorable mention to rainbow valley and that abandoned space shuttle and…wasn’t there an Epcot ball replica?? Driving by that as a little kid made my imagination run WILD…is that a real space shuttle?? Is Canadian Mickey down there?? What are you???? 

- Anne of green gables. Loved going to the Green Gables Heritage Place. The story being uniquely PEI was always so cool. Then cows started carrying their own raspberry cordials toward my last visits!

- Watching the ‘96 Olympics with my cousins on a tiny tv because that’s basically all that would come in. Huge seafood dinners of fresh lobster, mussels, and clams…almost crashing my moms boxy 90s Volvo into a ditch because she was foolish enough to let me try to drive

- The College of Piping and watching their shows! I wish I could find that claddagh ring… 

Anyway…sorry for randomly ranting and rambling. Hopefully this doesn’t come off tone-deaf or inappropriate. My only intention is to express my undying love, loyalty, and gratitude to this island.

I really liked the  reversible skirt. It packed small, but ""wore big"", by changing out t-shirts, scarves, and necklaces.

I wore the bathing suit only once.  Unless I can find a suit that offers support, but packs smaller, I may not take one along in the future.

I had debated about bringing the cooker, but was glad I had it. We stayed in a variety of accommodations, with different levels of breakfast offerings, cooking facilities, and in room coffee makers.   My husband does not get up and get moving until 9:30 or 10, and then only with copius amounts of coffee. Because he takes so many meds, he always needs to eat something with them, to keep from getting indigestion. The cooker was actually used a couple of times. 

The Ralph Lauren vest was an all star on travel day. We had bulkhead seats and, knowing our luggage would not be easily accessible, I pre-loaded the vest pockets with everything needed to see two people through two flights and two airports. I used the passport pockets of the vest for battery packs, and carried the passports in the front pocket of the Bagallini. The remainder of the vest pockets held charging cords, currency, folding readers, chapstick, tooth picks, and breath mints.

THE UNEXPECTED

My travel T-shirt was a blend that turned out to be itchy in tropical heat. I have a decent sense of fabrics and knew better, but cuteness won over common sense. I never wore it again after we arrived.

The planned laundry stop was thwarted by broken machines. I ended up sink washing and throwing clothes over lamps to help them dry, and shipping a whole bunch of dirty clothes home.

There was a power outage one evening in Panama City. With one of the battery packs and the small gooseneck laptiop USB light, we were not inconvenienced at all.

I had managed to cut out one bag, by using stuffable travel pillows but then people on a different forum said the airlines were treating the pillows like another piece of carry on luggage, forcing people to either check a bag or repack their carryons before boarding. Conseqently I went back to the 2.5 (+ .1 +.05) bag plan. We flew Avianca and, as it turns out, we could have used the travel pillows with no problem.

What was also unexpected about Avianca was that they did not staff their ticket counters until an hour or so before their flights, and we arrived at the airports a couple of hours early. So, though I had requested wheelchair assistance at the time I booked our flights, there was no one available to provide it. I was happy then, that I had limited our packing to a backpack and two manageable small bags. My husband was able to hold those on his lap while we navigated the TSA and gate location process. 

And then there was a whole misadventure of getting lost in the hills outside of Panama City, on a dark and moonless night, low on gas and out of cell phone range...but that's another story entirely.

Our check in process was great, valet the car for 30$ a night. Bellhop took our luggage up stairs, gave us some great hiking advice. Front desk was super helpful and was cool that we got actual Keys for our room keys, was a nice touch. The elevator is old and broke down for a few hours our 3rd day here but wasn’t a big deal. I like that they put a schedule up every day in the elevator on activities to do. The room itself was pretty great! By no means a 5 star/5 diamond room, but we were on the 5th floor and had an amazing view of the Upper Yosemite Falls each day. Rooms are historic and cozy, water was warm, electricity worked, and beds were great.  
All I really needed for a stay in Yosemite. 4/5 overall

Food at the bar is really good and so are the cocktails. Was nice to be able to grab lunch and dinner. 4/5 overall

As for the dinner buffet, I really enjoyed the chicken and the potatoes. My wife had the prime rib and I had some of hers it was good. But it’s hotel buffet food made in trailers, so nothing over the top amazing. We also did the breakfast buffet which was about the same, hotel buffet food. However the coffee and juice was great! 3/5 overall

The dining hall is amazing though. Overall I really enjoyed our stay here, it was everything we needed and super convenient to walk outside and be in the park and just hop on the shuttle or use our car since it was very dead while we were here. 4/5 for the whole stay!

The final note I would like to add is that the staff were all AMAZING! The bellhop, valet, servers, bartenders and the maid on our floor were all so kind and helpful. 

If you have any questions or comments don’t hesitate to ask!

This machine is built like an absolute tank but it **NEEDS SOME REPAIRS**: It powers on and pulls tasty shots, but has a leak in an internal water supply tube, causing a slow drip from the bottom when pulling a shot. This should be an easy fix, but is complicated by a stripped screw on the top of the machine that needs to be removed to access the internal parts (see attached photo showing the screw and some bent metal from my impatient attempt to open the top). The machine lid has a handmade wooden handle for temperature-safe handling that needs wood glue to repair.

I am the second owner of this machine and it has been vigorously maintained throughout its lifetime. It underwent a complete refurbishment and boiler replacement in 2019. This machine is built to last another 20 years if you are willing and able to make the repairs that are needed. I am selling this because I am in the process of moving and don't have the time/energy to fix it and also recently upgraded to my dream machine.

A new machine like this goes for $1749, the installed quick mill pressure gauge is a $55 value, installed flow control device from Chris Coffee is a $225 value.

Due to the installed upgrades, age of the machine and the repairs needed I am looking for **$800** or best offer . **Local pickup** in Upstate, NY area only.

A couple turned me away for politics (big red flag is stupidity). One turned me away for “dyed hair,” and that just sent me away from dating.

Five days ago, I decided to go back into dating! I met a cute guy, we talked over coffee, and we decided to go to his place to see if it was worth it. So yesterday, I biked over to the address and he invited me in. It was a small one, but it was nice. Everything was going fine until he decided to show a meme. It was made with AI. He seemed proud of that fact, too. So I bolted out and biked back to my place without saying a word.

The point I’m trying to make is that AI is becoming a bigger problem faster. It’s infecting people who are otherwise fine. It’s forcing us to go for another fish in the vast ocean of partners.

It was somewhat easy to start, I was motivated and ready to try 12:12. 
I started to lose around 4 pounds, went on vacation for the first time in years and kinda lost track and motivation after returning home. That was in September last year. 

While I know how IF and cico works, I feel overwhelmed and just confused as to where to start now. 

A little background - I work from home, take fluoxetine (anti depressants) every morning and my body was heavily depending on caffeine. I used to go for long walks until my dog passed way a year ago. Now I try to go for little walks and if I don’t feel too tired, I go to the gym after work but that’s really rare. 

I’d also have a 45 minute window after waking up in which I’d have to drink my coffee or I’d have an ugly migraine all day and feel fatigued. 

I don’t know where to start, if fluoxetine will stop my IF and if I can just avoid drinking coffee in the morning by just having a caffeine tablet to avoid a migraine while continuing fasting. 

I tried looking these things up but got a lot of mixed information 

Any help is appreciated.

1jqydfm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqydfm,Spendful: A deliberately simple iOS app to track your spending (Free lifetime access to early adopters),"Hi everyone,

I just launched an app called **Spendful** that I built to help my family track our spending. It's simple, easy to use, and works seamlessly with **iCloud** for **sharing data** (great for families, roommates, etc.). The full version of the app is **free** right now to encourage and thank early adopters (follow the IAP prompts to purchase for $0)---in the future, the “premium features” (currently, iCloud sharing and recurring expenses) will be behind a minimal IAP paywall.

Here is the link to Spendful in the App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spendful/id6739823913](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spendful/id6739823913)

Some more details...

I built Spendful as a deliberately simple app designed to make you more aware of how you spend your money. The name comes from “Spend” and “Mindful”—it’s not about budgeting or linking credit cards. Instead, it’s a fast, lightweight tool to help you track where your money goes as you spend it and, later, visualize your spending over time and category.

With other spend tracking apps, I got tired of the clutter. Most were visually unappealing to me, often with invasive ads or high premium price points (often for basic things like simple data aggregation). Many had long onboarding processes, requiring account creation or the linking of pre-existing Apple-external cloud accounts. Even with all the noise, many did not offer the basic features I wanted: cloud syncing/data persistence, sharing, and Siri support. So, when I had some time on my hands, I decided to build my own!

Think of Spendful like a notebook in your pocket, one that requires minimal effort to use. You create categories that matter to you, track your spending in them over time, and build your financial intuition as you go. No ads, no subscriptions, just a straightforward tool to help you build awareness around your money habits.

Siri Shortcuts make logging purchases even easier—after you've bought coffee or groceries and only have one hand for your phone, just say, “**Hey Siri, Track Spending**.”

This is my first iOS app, so would love to hear your thoughts—feedback, feature requests, etc. Let me know what you think.",3,1743725050.0,iosapps,0,1.0,False

It’s approx 4’ x 2’ x 16”. Made with red oak. I am in the process of finishing my basement (which is why some of the stuff in the background looks unfinished) and we put a coffee/drink bar in. We found two slabs of the marble you see on FB for $80 per slab. They came from a pretty historical courthouse in my area (I guess they were renovating and one of the contractors took some to sell) so it has a little history behind it.

Originally I was going to try to do the whole build with just glue and dowels, but I did end up shooting the miters on the table top with my brad gun just for support (I was worried the glue was going to separate over time- maybe I’m just paranoid).

When the bombs fell in 2077, Brazil was not directly hit, but the global nuclear winter and the subsequent collapse of international trade devastated the nation. The federal government struggled to maintain control as food shortages, irradiated mutant wildlife from the Amazon, and social unrest tore the country apart.

By 2100, Brazil had fractured into numerous competing factions. Over the next century and a half, these factions evolved, merged, and split, leading to the complex political landscape of 2276.

# Major Factions and Their Foundations

**1. Confederation of the North**

Formed from an alliance of surviving Amazonian communities and tribes, this confederation emphasizes environmental protection and sustainable living. They have adapted to the mutant rainforest and developed a unique culture that blends pre-war Brazilian and indigenous traditions. They are governed by a council that meets regularly.

**2. Granary Kingdom of Pará and Maranhão**

A neo-feudal state that emerged when a charismatic leader united the coastal regions of Pará and Maranhão. The kingdom maintains a fragile balance between modernization and tradition, with a monarch claiming descent from the Portuguese and Brazilian royal family.

**3. United Republic of the Southeast**

Built on the ruins of Brazil's industrial heart, this republic strives to recreate the technological advances of the pre-war era. It is the most ""developed"" region but faces corruption and inequality. Though theoretically a democracy, many say it is an oligarchy ruled by the coffee-growing agricultural class.

**4. Legion of the Pampas**

A militaristic society that arose in the southern plains. Inspired by gaucho culture and a nomadic lifestyle, the Legion emphasizes martial prowess and expansionism, often clashing with neighboring factions. They are expert horsemen and call the steppes of the Pampa their home, ruled by a leader known as the *Caudilho*. They are a nomadic empire.

**5. Socialist State of the Pantanal**

Founded on egalitarian principles, this state attempts to create a workers' paradise in the wetlands of the Pantanal. They face challenges from mutant wildlife and conflicts with the Legion and the United Republic. Governed by the *Great Commissioner*.

**6. Wastelands of the Caatinga**

The harsh irradiated semi-arid region has become home to various nomadic tribes and bandits. The cangaçeiros, inspired by historical outlaws, have evolved into a significant cultural force in the area. Numerous tribes fight for resources and territory, making life a true hell.

**7. Integralist State of Manaus**

A fascist enclave and hermit state within the Confederation of the North, based in Manaus. They cling to an extremist ideology from pre-war times, dreaming of reunifying Brazil under their rule. Their isolated capital means limited contact with outsiders, and they remain aggressively isolationist.

**8. Posadist State of Acre**

A bizarre communist state that believes in alliances with extraterrestrials. They conduct strange experiments in the remote forests of Acre, seeking signs of alien life.

**9. Narco-State of Guanabara**

Centered in the ruins of Rio de Janeiro, this state is controlled by powerful drug cartels. They maintain a facade of legitimacy while profiting from the vices of other factions. Cartels are in constant conflict with one another.

**10. Federal Government of Brazil**

A small remnant of the pre-war government taken over by the military, clinging to Brasília. They claim legitimacy over all of Brazil but lack the power to enforce it. However, with access to advanced pre-war technology, they are a force to be reckoned with. They believe they are the rightful successors of Brazil's presidents since Deodoro da Fonseca and roam the wastelands in green and yellow power armor. They are extremely xenophobic and elitist, considering all foreigners impure.

# Minor Factions

**Confederation of Free Cities of the Northeast**

A loose alliance of city-states in the Northeast, emphasizing local autonomy and free trade. Inspired by ancient maritime republics.

**Free Economic Zone of Teresina**

A capitalist enclave focused on trade and economic growth, governed by a council of entrepreneurs.

**City-State of Vitória and Free City of Florianópolis**

Independent city-states that have managed to remain neutral in larger conflicts, also called ""Nova Gênova.""

**Reich Porto Alegrense**

A small fascist state with strong German influences, often in conflict with the Legion of the Pampas and paying tribute to them.

# Organizations

**Atomic Proletariat**

A transcendentalist group that worships atomic radiation and the atom. They have spread throughout Brazil, considered strange and peaceful, but far from harmless. They have studied atomic weapons and are capable of manufacturing mini-bombs. Living a simple tribal lifestyle, they are masters of radiation and manage pre-war nuclear power plants, selling energy to the highest bidder. They guard the secrets of radiation with utmost care.

**Jesuits**

The remnants of the former Catholic and Protestant churches in Brazil, usually using churches as bases of operation and doing charity, but protecting their goods with heavy weapons. They organize as a theocratic organization, with the leader being the Great Pontiff, who governs from a chapel built at the foot of Christ the Redeemer.

**New Coffee Company**

A huge guild controlling coffee plantations in coffee-producing states. They’ve weaponized their coffee plants through selective breeding in the irradiated soil, creating highly caffeinated variants that they process into combat drugs. Their elite guards, the ""Cavaleiros do Café,"" are feared for their coffee-fueled battle frenzy.

**Pirates of the Rio Doce**

Raiders who exploit the toxic waters of the Rio Doce, using specially modified boats to navigate the contaminated river. They’ve developed resistance to the river’s toxins and use poisoned weapons harvested from its waters. Their leader, ""A Rainha Tóxica,"" is said to be able to breathe the river’s deadly mist.

**Underground Community of Curitiba**  
A sophisticated underground society in the ruins of Curitiba, known for their advanced recycling and sustainable living systems. They’ve transformed the city’s pre-war public transportation tunnels into a complex underground metropolis. They’re highly isolationist but trade their expertise in underground agriculture and water filtration.

**Radio Rebels**  
A network of wastelander communications specialists maintaining a series of pre-war radio stations. They broadcast news, warnings about dangers, and serve as message relays between communities. Their main station, ""Voz do Sertão,"" is a crucial source of information about raider movements and trading opportunities.

**Order of the Atomic Bandeirantes**  
A group of heavily armed explorers and salvagers who venture into the most irradiated areas of the former megalopolises. They pattern themselves after the historical bandeirantes, complete with modernized versions of colonial-era gear mixed with radiation suits. Based in small fortified outposts, they sell their discoveries to the highest bidders.

**Masters of Itaipu**  
A group of scientists and tribes from Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay that formed around the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant, creating a self-sufficient community. Comprised of workers who managed the plant, they control the hydroelectric facility that still operates. When the Legion of the Pampas invaded the region in the mid-2200s, the tribes and scientists isolated themselves inside the plant, barring all entrances. Using pre-war explosives planted by the plant, they threatened to blow up the dam and flood the entire region. Thus, the Legion of the Pampas and the United Republic of the Southeast buy energy from the Masters of Itaipu, who, heavily armed, defend the plant with tooth and nail. It is unknown whether the threat of explosives was just a bluff, but no one wanted to take the chance, and the Legion of the Pampas and the United Republic preferred to keep the plant as a neutral territory in any case.

**The Positivist Imperial Cult**  
A sect of lunatics who live in tribes around Brazil. They believe that Brazilian society is decadent and, for that reason, was punished by the Great War. They see figures such as Dom Pedro, Deodoro da Fonseca, Getúlio Vargas, Castelo Branco, Médici, Geisel, and several other presidents up to 2020 as idols and true examples of Brazilian culture. The Constitution of 1988 is the cult's bible, and places like Christ the Redeemer, the Praça dos Três Poderes, Brasília, the Palácio do Catete, Itaipu, and several other locations are considered sacred and pilgrimage sites for the cult's followers. The cult's headquarters is unknown; rumors circulate that they have formed underground cities hidden in the Brazilian forests, protected by layers of security and signs known only to the cult's adherents. In any case, they are tolerated, but some more radical factions are dealt with violently.

**Radical Patrolmen from the Beloved Nation (PRONA)**  
A paramilitary order based on chapters that operate throughout Brazilian territory. Their hierarchy is strictly military, and they possess advanced technology such as vertibirds and power armor. Their origins trace back to cells of the ABIN, Armed Forces, and Police, which, after the war, formed the organization with the aim of regulating and protecting what remains of Brazil. Within the organization, there are three divisions: the Navy, the Air Force, and the Ground Forces. PRONA commands various forward posts and enormous citadels throughout the wilderness. Some factions within PRONA are more reactionary, others more humanitarian, some more isolationist, and others more authoritarian, seeking to exert control and become the new rulers of Brazil. These factions compete for control of the nation's high council. PRONA generally collaborates with the Imperial Cult, protecting the cult's followers during their pilgrimages.

**Radiation Hunters**  
The Radiation Hunters are a guild specialized in hunting radioactive beasts in the Brazilian wilderness. The guild is an organization aimed at regulating and training hunters specialized in the various beasts that inhabit the Brazilian wilderness, such as three-eyed giant capybaras, radioactive flying coatis, mutant alligators, translucent jaguars, and other beasts that can cause problems. Their headquarters is in Goiânia.

**The Oilmen**  
Survivors of the Great War who endured on offshore oil platforms and those who survived on Brazilian Navy ships. More of a tribe and culture than a unified faction.

# Ongoing Conflicts and Challenges

* Territorial disputes between the Legion of the Pampas and the United Republic of the Southeast.
* Ideological conflicts between the Socialist Pantanal and its neighbors.
* Expansion attempts by the Integralist State of Manaus, opposed by the Confederation of the North.
* Struggles against mutant wildlife, particularly in the Amazon and Pantanal regions.
* Competition for scarce resources, especially in the Caatinga region.
* The constant threat of raiders, particularly from the Caatinga.

This fragmented Brazil stands at a crossroads, with each faction fighting for dominance while facing the challenges of a post-apocalyptic world. The future of this once-unified nation hangs in the balance, shaped by the actions of survivors, mutants, and those born into this new world.

Hi everyone! Obligatory I'm on mobile, sorry for any errors/ bad spacing! 

I had VSG plus hernia repair on 8/8/24. 



Stats: HW 276, CW 199, GW 145, 5'1 36Y/O F.



I had a rough recovery/ first few months with some digestive issues (lower GI, not surgical complications. If anything, rapid diet change and weight loss impact, but certainly no regrets). I easily and quickly lost my first 45lbs, but I've been stuck and not seeing weight dropping for about 2-3 months. I am seeing differences in measurements/ physical appearance, and I feel great, pretty much fully recovered from the GI issues I had. 



However, not losing lbs is starting to wear on me. I haven't lost more than 1 lb since January that I kept off. I got as low as 197.5, and have gone back and forth between 198-199 since Feb! 


I have another appointment set for mid April, but I was wondering what everyone else is eating for the most part 6+ months out of VSG or similar. 



My current intake is: 


7-9 AM: Vitamins, decaf coffee, small breakfast (usually yogurt or eggs, sometimes a protein bar)



Mid-day: usually leftovers of some kind. I have 1C Pyrex measuring/ storage bowls that I use several days a week- this is usually something like chicken, brown rice (or cauliflower rice) a veggie (peppers, onion, broccoli, green beans) and some shredded cheese. Or a mini low carb tortilla with turkey and cheese.

I drink 1 premier shake around 3pm. 

Come home and have a small snack or dinner around 6-7PM. Dinner is usually something like the chicken/ rice, fish, beef w/ potatoes, or if we're having spaghetti, I'll have no pasta, add ricotta, tacos- no shell or substitute rice/ 4-5 tortilla chips for crunch. Salad, cooked spinach, or some high fiber veggies with dinner at least 2x a week. Quick nights maybe a keto pizza or hotdog, all dressed with no bun.

I’m on strict carnivore and fasting for 15hr+ but unable to eat food a/f breaking the fast.

My food generally consists of beef mince, butter, salt & water.

Also have dairy included (I drink coffee w/milk) which fills my small appetite and then rest of the day I barely want to eat anything….

Mostly I force myself but now I feel I can’t even do that. Also it’s not beef aversion as I don’t want to eat anything at all. Had aversion phase which escalated quickly in previous months after fasting.

What should I do? I don’t want to slip into any eating disorder neither do I want to lose any weight due to calorie deficit…(for ref. I’m 24F, 157cm w/101lb weight)

I had VSG plus hernia repair on 8/8/24. 



Stats: HW 276, CW 199, GW 145, 5'1 36Y/O F.



I had a rough recovery/ first few months with some digestive issues (lower GI, not surgical complications. If anything, rapid diet change and weight loss impact, but certainly no regrets). I easily and quickly lost my first 45lbs, but I've been stuck and not seeing weight dropping for about 2-3 months. I am seeing differences in measurements/ physical appearance, and I feel great, pretty much fully recovered from the GI issues I had. 



However, not losing lbs is starting to wear on me. I haven't lost more than 1 lb since January that I kept off. I got as low as 197.5, and have gone back and forth between 198-199 since Feb! 


I have another appointment set for mid April, but I was wondering what everyone else is eating for the most part 6+ months out of VSG or similar. 



My current intake is: 


7-9 AM: Vitamins, decaf coffee, small breakfast (usually yogurt or eggs, sometimes a protein bar)



Mid-day: usually leftovers of some kind. I have 1C Pyrex measuring/ storage bowls that I use several days a week- this is usually something like chicken, brown rice (or cauliflower rice) a veggie (peppers, onion, broccoli, green beans) and some shredded cheese. Or a mini low carb tortilla with turkey and cheese.

I drink 1 premier shake around 3pm. 

Come home and have a small snack or dinner around 6-7PM. Dinner is usually something like the chicken/ rice, fish, beef w/ potatoes, or if we're having spaghetti, I'll have no pasta, add ricotta, tacos- no shell or substitute rice/ 4-5 tortilla chips for crunch. Salad, cooked spinach, or some high fiber veggies with dinner at least 2x a week. Quick nights maybe a keto pizza or hotdog, all dressed with no bun.

Ever since I got pregnant all I ever saw online and in real life was vile negativity around motherhood (although it's much much worse online).

I write this partly as a rant to vent and partly hoping to ease the concerns of women who, like me, read these things online when pregnant and are terrified of making the worst mistake ever. If I could go back in time, the only thing I'd do different is to not read anything about parenthood and pregnancy on online forums. And stay away from people in real life who desperately want to scare you that it will suck or want to see you say you regret it.

These are just some of the things I read and heard, so that they lead me to believe these are universal experiences. It turns out they're not:

- ""pregnancy is scary/dangerous and will ruin your body"". I had a perfectly uneventful pregnancy despite being of ""advanced maternal age"" as they call it. With the exception of some nausea in the first trimester, which my OB promptly handled with a prescription, the most annoying part was peeing a lot during the last trimester. I did not have any health conditions beforehand and I didn't develop any during or after. It went by fast and I didn't turn into a monster. In fact my skin looked the best it ever did in my life with not a single breakout in sight and my hair was thick and luscious. Plenty of women have this same experience.

- ""delivery will hurt the worst you've ever felt in your life and you will likely DIE OR BE INJURED FOREVER"". I was so terrified of delivery mainly due to what I read  online that I had begged my OB for an elective c section. But I went into labor spontaneously and something in my gut told me to just do it. So I got the epidural instead and guess what, I've had migraines that were so much more painful than delivery was. I pushed for thirty minutes and the baby was out. I had a minor first degree tear that healed in a week. I experienced no urinary incontinence or any other issues after and I didn't even get a single stretch mark.

- ""pregnancy and delivery will ruin your body and age you"". This is deeply misogynistic bullshit and completely untrue. If you take care of yourself before and during pregnancy, chances are you will look the same after sooner or later. And if you don't right away, well you did the most badass thing a human can do. You deserve grace and are beautiful just the way you are and you can do things to make yourself feel even better.  I feel more confident than I ever did before in my life after doing this.
I am 15 lbs overweight now at 6 months postpartum but guess what, this is not the first time in my life I've gained weight and I can lose it again once I stop BF. Nothing else has changed, I don't look haggard and I haven't aged any more than I normally would in this time. Sorry folks, but a lot of aging is genetic and also the habits you had before getting pregnant will impact it far more than just pregnancy. I've used sunscreen and retinoids religiously for years before getting pregnant and my skin looks just as good now. I still have time to slather on sunscreen before I go out. 

- ""you won't be yourself anymore"" Not sure what this is even. No one is the same person throughout their whole life. I still have the same values and goals but now I also have a tiny person that I love more than life itself baked in there. My baby actually gives me so much more motivation to be even better than I used to be to set an example for them.

- ""you won't have time to yourself/for hobbies/to travel"". I was surprised to find out that if I was just a bit strategic about it, I had enough time to myself. I could do my hygiene routines, take a walk, have a coffee, do a hobby. Granted, I have a great husband who is an equal partner but that is part and parcel of the groundwork you need to do before having a baby to make things easier on yourself later. Choose a great partner ladies, and try to be close to family (of origin or chosen) even if they don't always say the perfect thing. Let the small things go if you want help from the ""village"". Also, you can make time if you stop doomscrolling all the time (guilty of this myself). Maybe you can't go to rock climbing anymore for a bit? Pick up a guitar or a paintbrush and do a hobby you can do from home.
And if you can't, you won't die because you didn't do something for a year. It's just a season, it goes by so fast. You will do the thing again, it's not forever.
And you can absolutely travel with a child but if you're not comfortable, you will travel again when they're a bit older. Again, it's just a season in life, I'm sure you didn't travel internationally three times a year when you were 18 and you lived.

- ""you will never sleep again and will have PPD, PPA etc."" I've always had the propensity to be anxious and mildly depressed at times so I was extremely concerned of developing PDD. To my surprise I did not at all, in fact my pregnancy and postpartum have been some of the most mentally peaceful times of my life. If it happens, there are resources available to help you but don't consider it a forgone conclusion (like I did).

Sleep has been rough at times but we take turns with my husband and try to figure out ways to give us both rest. It's not the first time in my life I'm having rough sleep (doing a Master's while working was rough, some stressful periods at work have been rough too) and I knew I will survive the rough nights and sleep again. And I was right because since the baby turned four months he's been waking up only once at night to feed. If anything, now I fall asleep the moment my head hits the pillow because Im forced to cut down on bad habits like scrolling while in bed.

All this is to say, the parts of motherhood I found the scariest have been nowhere near what I imagined. And the one part I could not had imagined no matter what I read was how much I would love my baby and how my heart would nearly explode with love and joy as I sat there feeding them at 2 am. And how confident and sure of myself I would feel during this surreal experience, even at times where I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. Don't fall for the fearmongering and if you love motherhood, do it loudly and unapologetically.",50,1743724508.0,beyondthebump,61,0.72,False

Initially, the order was incorrect (although largely due to my own indecisiveness), Yao fixed it accordingly as quickly as he could. As compensation for the mistakes, I given brass fuchi and koshira fittings for free! Despite my difficulty in deciding what I wanted, Hanbon was very accommodating and patient which I appreciate. Overall, even though my katana took double the time expected to be complete (3 weeks became 6), it was worth the wait!

My order specifications are as listed:

Final Order 
- Light Brown or Coffee Silk Tsuka Ito with Hishigami wrap
- Black Samegawa Panels
- S113 Yellow Stripe saya with metal kojiri end cap
- 1060 Folded Carbon Steel with etched Midare hamon
- IT283 Tsuba
- M335 Menuki
- FK407 Fuchi and Koshira
- Bo Hi (Blood Groove)
- Light Brown or Coffee Sageo
- H04 Brass Habaki and Seppa 
- Metal Koijiri End Cap
- Devil May Cry Vergil Katana Alloy Koiguchi
- Swordsmith name engraved on tang 

In addition to the free brass fittings, I believe Yao has given me Japanese ito wrappings that I inquired about which he used as the sageo as well in order to match which went well as it goes along with the floral/cherry blossom theme I wanted! I also asked to make the tsuka haichi shaped to add a touch of elegance which can be seen in photos 3 and 4. This order involved much deliberation and learning about Hanbon's ""off-menu options"" over time so I would recommend doing at least some research into HBF's options prior to finalizing your order (unlike me 😅).",11,1743724324.0,Katanas,5,1.0,False

There's a misunderstanding of how manifestation works in general. Most people think it is doing a technique and then waiting for something to happen in the 3D. As if the technique by itself has the power to give you what you want.

Manifesting is about changing you.

Not the 3D, not the other person, not your circumstances. Just you.

More precisely, who you assume to be and accept the version of you that you want to be.

To better understand this, imagine the outside world as a mirror, and your assumptions about who you are and the world are in front of that mirror.

Now let me ask you this, if you're standing in front of a mirror and you don't like the shirt the reflection is showing you. Do you tell the reflection to change clothes? Probably not. You would go, change it, and then come back to see it.

You wanting something new in your reality follows the same logic. 

You need to identify with the version of you that, when you stand in front of the mirror, will have what you want.

To do this, we have all the arsenal of methods, techniques, and everything in between to get into the identity that has your desire already.

The ""work"" (if you want to put it that way) is much more about knowing yourself to surrender and accepting the new version of yourself who has what you're desiring.

The more you keep defending your old assumptions and yell at the mirror to change the reflection, the longer you'll be standing there without having results.

Test this and see what happens. Stop waiting for the 3D to show you something different. Get used to the version of you who has it already using the technique you prefer. Enjoy being that version of you, and your manifestation will come to you as naturally and effortlessly as you can imagine.

  
Some of you ask me if you could buy me a coffee for being helpful. If you want, you can donate to me here [https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666](https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666). I'll probably use it to bring food to a stray dog shelter nearby.

1jqxxc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1jqxxc9/creatista_pro_concern/,Creatista Pro concern,"Hello folks. I debated whether or not to put this here or in r/marriage, but decided that it was ultimately about Nespresso solutions, so here it is. 

My wife and I are best friends and coffee lovers and we have had a Nespresso Vertuo for a few years now. We typically just brew coffee, especially in the mornings, but we have an occasional espresso, double espresso, or gran lungo in the afternoons. 

Now, my wife has had three major crushes for quite some time:
- Jason Momoa
- Henry Cavill
- The Nespresso Creatista Pro 

I've told her for a long time that her chances of getting any one of the three are probably about equal.

Of course, a few weeks ago, she talked me into it and I found myself spending an ungodly amount of money on a coffeemaker. A pretty one, one with a touchscreen, and admittedly one that makes the most easily made lattes I've ever had at home, and I was surprised that it is the original Nespresso pods line, and not the same type as the Vertuo, but whatever. But it's still a $900 coffeemaker...that I have found doesn't actually make coffee.

Sure, it has the Americano setting, but once I realized that it is basically just a weak coffee that is a watered down espresso and tastes like it, it got frustrated. Why on earth would we pay $900 for a coffeemaker that Doesn't. Make. Regular. Coffee?

I don't want an espresso or a latte or a 3 oz lungo in the morning. I want my damn 120g of caffeine in an 8 oz cup.

I've been experimenting, and the best version I've come up with is to brew a lungo and then add a shot of espresso, and then run another espresso through the same espresso pod. This works and it tastes great, but it is definitely not the same volume of coffee and I'm using two pods for every cup when I used to only use one pod per cup, so while I initially rejoiced that the original line pods are cheaper, they are now more expensive if I have to double them up every time. To make matters worse, she ALSO wants a regular cup of coffee in the morning, so we are using our $900 coffeemaker to use four pods of Nespresso daily to make two cups of coffee. 

Please tell me that there is a better way to do this.

And yes, I know that an Americano IS technically a watered down espresso....but it doesn't taste that way from any other coffeemaker and the $900 coffeemaker makes.... shitty regular coffee.

Me and my husband alternate who picks him up and drops him off at daycare ( i did my work schedule around his to accommodate). Any time I'm not at work I'm washing bottles, getting his milk and stuff ready for daycare, making sure the house stays somewhat organized,  coming home on my lunch break to prep dinner and make coffee for the next day, all I ever do is try to make our lifes easier and run efficiently.  Today my husband picks up our son and doesn't follow his normal nap times, doesn't follow his feeding schedule, didn't wash any bottles, in fact I came home on lunch and cleaned and when I got off work the house looked like I never did. So as soon as I get home he hands me the baby and starts playing guitar. I try to put the baby down for a nap so that he's not up too past his bedtime and he's just being as loud as can be. I was so frustrated that I came outta the room after putting him down crying,  he asks what's wrong and I just lost it.

Our past is complicated, but this encounter at a coffee shop three months ago was my last straw. 

In January, one of our cousins had a wedding. Since everyone was in town, a bunch of us planned to go to the local coffee shop for coffee and brunch. He and another cousin arrived early, bought their food, and went upstairs. Not long after, myself and three others arrived. I got my food and headed upstairs to meet them. Since they finished their food, they were chatting with coffee. I sat down, started eating and engaged in the conversation. I responded to something my brother said, with a half-mouth-full of chewed food, when he looked me dead in the eyes and said “Do not talk to me with food in your mouth.” Fully serious tone. No playful dialect. 

Mind you, what I said was fully distinguishable, not like I tried speaking with a FULL mouth of unchewed food, where someone would ask ‘come again?’

I saw him with his unchanged look, clocked that he was NOT joking, and told him “If this is how you’re going to be, I’m not talking to you.”

He immediately responds “No really, that is so fucking rude of you. Don’t talk with your mouth full; who raised you?” 

My adrenaline skyrocketed at that moment. I wanted to scream, or throw my coffee in his face, or punch him if I knew it would do anything. Instead, I left and avoided him the rest of the weekend.

Now being back in our home state, I’ve continued to avoid him. I missed his birthday dinner. I planned on missing our mom’s birthday dinner, had he planned on being there. 

Historically he makes family get-togethers hostile, and he moves on like he wasn’t the cause. I’m sick of it. He never apologizes for anything that is clearly his doing, and my parents essentially enable his behavior because they want him to be included in future gatherings. 

Am I overreacting to his behavior by avoiding him? Our mom wants me to reconcile, likely to keep the “peace”.

I use visualization, but you can do it with whatever method you prefer. In this example, I'll do it for SP since it seems that's the common theme, but it can be whatever you want.

I sat down, visualized myself with my SP doing whatever would make me feel I'm with her in a healthy, loving relationship.

Now here is the key part.

At the moment I'm seeing this, I realize this experience is happening right now.

I'm not controlling her, not controlling how I feel. It's happening just like real life.

It feels real, because it's REAL.

This shifts my perspective from daydreaming to actually feeling fulfilled by what I'm seeing. My wish is being fulfilled right in front of me.

Once I reach this point, I let myself surrender to the experience and let the experience change me. This is nothing out of this world, you just surrender to the reality of what you're experiencing.

After some time, the experience settled, and now I have (I am in) that relationship. I was changed by it and now I start living with the shoes of the version of me who is with her.

If my mind goes looking for proof or evidence (which is rare after having that experience), I just get back to the knowing that I've already experienced having her, like a memory.

If I do this right, there's no more waiting for it to happen. It already happened.

I don't feel desiring anymore. This obviously depends on what you mean by desiring, but I'm talking about the wanting coming from lack.

It would feel like you're the person who that experience happened to.

And this is the key to all of this.

You're not using a technique to make something happen. You're doing it to experience being the person with their wish being fulfilled in front of them.

But more importantly, the person you're after the fact. The person who already has it.

Also, my visualization is not that good, but that doesn't matter. You just need to accept that the experience you're living in your imagination IS real.

Some of you ask me if you could buy me a coffee for being helpful. If you want, you can donate to me here https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666. I'll probably use it to bring food to a stray dog shelter nearby.

Some time ago, something happened that was extremely upsetting for me, and I’m still carrying the weight of it today.

Back when I was studying my degree, I went through a very deep depressive episode and became very isolated. To at least try to salvage the academic side of things, I brought my psychiatrist’s report to the student counselor. He more or less washed his hands of it and told me I could request some kind of accommodation, but that I had to bring it to the dean, since she was the one who had to approve it.

So I emailed it to her… and a few days later, we’re in class. She’s doing her thing with the projector on — everyone can see everything — and she goes and opens a chat conversation (I have no idea who with), and the message literally says:
“We’ve got another fire, this time from a student who, honestly, is completely nuts.”
Mind you, I had barely had any non-academic interaction with her at all aside from just sending that report. WTF.

Everyone in the class saw it, and the gossip started flying. I was mortified. From that point on, I had no social life whatsoever. I spent days hiding in the library or the bathroom, and eventually I just stopped going to the university entirely.
In the end, I completely lost that academic year — and it looks like I’m going to lose a second one now too, because I still can’t bring myself to set foot in that place. If I went back, I’d have to face that same dean and those same professors, the ones who apparently spend their coffee breaks gossiping about the students who are struggling the most.

I’m spending a fortune on therapy, but honestly, they don’t seem to have much to say that helps.

And because of how it happened, I don’t have a screenshot or message or anything to prove it. No one in the class would speak up either — I tried asking one or two “friends” I had left, but they bailed, because it was easier for them to just look the other way.

If this had happened at a workplace, with labor laws and an actual written message, I could have quit and gotten a nice compensation for damages.
But now, I can’t even transfer to another university. I’m in my third year, and I’d lose a ton of credits that wouldn’t transfer (I'm in Spain and the credit transfer system sucks)
The thought of it breaks me, because I estimate it would take me three or four more years to finally get my degree.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. This fucking woman has destroyed my life.
And this isn’t even the first time a professor has said horrific things — stuff like “maybe women should just stay home having children instead of being in college.” And no one’s ever done anything.
And on top of it all, they’re holding my credits hostage.


TL;DR:
While studying my degree, I had a serious depressive episode and submitted a psychiatrist’s report to request accommodations. The dean opened a private chat in front of the whole class where she referred to me as “another fire, this time a student who’s completely nuts.” This led to public humiliation, isolation, dropping out, and losing my academic year — possibly two. I have no solid proof, no one will back me up, and transferring universities would cost me years. I’m in therapy, but nothing helps. I feel like this person destroyed my life, and no one at the university has ever been held accountable.

He has invited me for a catch up soon, and mentioned he got my phone number from MM. 

It might seem a bit odd, but in our situation actually the wife was a secret to most of MMs friends in our city and I was openly seen as MMs partner. (We were all new to the city - nobody knew them)

I'm not sure what this particular friend knows. I'm not sure if he ever knew MM is married. I'm not sure if he ever officially was told I was a girlfriend or anything. All I know is we'd all meet together, me sitting next to MM, and sort of clearly together even though status was unspoken.

I've been NC with MM for a few months and I'm pretty sure he's left the country now (a long story but he reacted strongly to our break up - announced in January that he would be leaving in March - so I'm assuming he's gone now). I'm pretty sure that's why this friend reached out. He probably called MM up for a coffee, find out he's left, okay what about a coffee with your girl instead then. He explained to me he's just going through some loneliness and wanted some company, so I agreed.

I'm sure he's going to mention MM, maybe about him leaving, maybe about our break up. I have always been more towards hiding the relationship because obviously it's an affair. So my preference is to say ""who, me and MM? No, we were just friends. He's a married man!"" But what if MM told him more details about us and I'm effectively outing it as an affair rather than just a regular relationship. I can't decide which way to go with it. I also want to avoid any long discussions regarding MM and where he is, what he's doing etc as I just don't want to know or have to pretend to be mildly interested in him.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

Just leaving after 5 nights at Avila Resort.

1.  The people of Curacao are great. We met a mix of natives, expats and visitors, and (nearly) everyone was super friendly and very ready to provide advice or assistance.  We were able to get by speaking English, and only once (Otrabanda drink stand) did I get the feeling that there was a communication barrier (pointing, smiling, and cash always works when ordering beer).

2.  Safety: we never felt even the slightest bit unsafe. Lots of comments about not leaving stuff in your car (common sense) but we saw Audis, Porsches, Mercedes, etc., all over the place, so use common sense. We saw couples and single people walking at all hours of the day/night, and you could tell they were tourists, so all was good. We went to “Amor pa Otrobanda” the day we arrived, and there were lots of local folks set up with food, gifts, drinks, live music, etc., and it was very cool, but not in a super touristy part of Willemstad. 

3.  Klein Curaçao with Miss Ann boat trips on a Sunday was awesome. If you’re worried at all about being seasick, we recommend Miss Ann. The trip is only an hour vs two hours. From what we saw, Mermaid’s private area is larger and had a nicer white sand beach, but Miss Ann’s is great. The weekend trips include arrival snacks/sandwiches/fresh fruit, an open bar, and a barbecue lunch. The staff is super friendly, and the masseuse is great (extra charge). The snorkeling was okay, and they will chum the water in the afternoon to bring in the fish. We actually saw a small sea turtle and snorkeled with it for about five minutes- very cool. The lighthouse is very interesting, as is what’s left of an old steel shipwreck and a newer fiberglass sailboat wreck. Well worth it in our opinion.  Leaves the dock at 9:00 and returns at about 5:30. Ride in the stern on the bottom on the way over (the wind will carry away the diesel fumes, and you’ll be the first off the yacht to claim your beach chairs), if you’d like to ride in the bow on the way back, get on one of the first dinghies back to ya ht when leaving. We loved it and will go again. 

4.  Willemstad- The floating bridge is pretty cool. If it’s opening while you’re there, there’s a very quick ferry that will take you across. Lots of cool shops and restaurants.  Lots of art galleries/shops as well, but know that most close around 5:00 pm.  

5.  Avila Resort - 4/5. Outlets are the round 220v. Staff is super friendly, the beach is very nice. The Pen restaurant was the least best food we had on the island, but it was not bad, just not great. Pool bar staff was great in the morning for coffee. Snorkeling in the two beach areas was a good place to get started, but not great. 

6.  Restaurants: we ate at The Pen at Avila, Hemingway at Lion’s Dive, the Grand Cafe Gouverneur de Rouville, and Brisa do Mar (near Tugboat Beach). Best to worst: Brisa do Mar, Grand Cafe Gouverneur de Rouville, Hemingway, The Pen. All were very adequate and would return to all but the Pen again. Also had breakfast and coffee at Van Gogh’s. Great coffee and food, but if you’re in any kind of hurry, ask for the check when your food is delivered (pretty much the same everywhere). Make reservations if you can at any restaurants for dinner. And if you change plans, be courteous and let them know. Nearly every restaurant we went to asked us if we had reservations, and if you do, you’ll get better seating. 

7.  Beaches/Snorkeling: TUG BOAT BEACH! By all means, check out all the beaches for different vibes, but if you want to kill a whole day just snorkeling and chilling out in an atmosphere that can’t be replicated anywhere in the world, plan a whole day here. The day we went was a bit hazy/cloudy, but it was still the best snorkeling you could imagine - eels, sea snakes, schools of fish, solitary fish, etc. just beautiful. You can rent beach chairs, as well as snorkeling gear, to include the sea scooters. We rented fins, and they were worth it. They will store your bag for $3 so you don’t have to worry about your personal belongings. They have soft drinks and beer, but only chips and hotdogs to eat.  We also visited Grote Knip, Klein Knip, Playa Jeremi, and Playa Santa Cruz. Grote Knip is gorgeous and quite large. Go, grab a couple of chairs and an umbrella, and the guys will find you, charge you $15 and give you a receipt. We got there at 10:00 am, and there was plenty of room. By 1:00 it was packed out. Still fun. Snorkeling wasn’t great, but the water was beautiful. 

8.  Airport - arrival was easy, we tried to use the Airside app, but  really not sure it saved us any time, as the kiosks were down, and a passport agent had to look at our passports anyway. No stamp ☹️ (does anyone stamp passports anymore?). We used Hertz to rent a car (just because), it was easy, but we could have saved money by using a local place. Airport departure - Car rental return - park in the spot for your company. We had Hertz. We parked, rep came out and checked us in. Long walk from there to departures (you may want to drop luggage and your passenger first). If you need to check a bag you’ll have to line up. Once you do that…Security - stop one: scan boarding pass, stop two: scan passport, select airlines and flight, stop three: X-ray bags and scanners (no TSA precheck - obviously, so shoes come off).  That’s it. Very efficient.  Once in the terminal, it’s very nice. There’s a VIP lounge you can purchase a three hour pass, but we skipped it. Lunch spot by gates 5-8 have a very nice selection. Also a bar.  Two hours from arrival at airport should be plenty (we didn’t check bags, and we had an hour of down time to chill).

9.  We will definitely return. 3.5 hours in the air from Charlotte, Eastern time zone, US dollars for many/most transactions (if you want), very friendly, safe, great water (to snorkel in and to drink - Curacao desalination).  If you’re on the fence, pull the trigger and go. You will not regret it. 

Thank you Curacao! We will be back! ",17,1743721803.0,curacao,6,1.0,False

1jqx77g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1jqx77g/comprehensive_review_hyatt_ziva_cap_cana_from_a/,"Comprehensive Review - Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana, from a novice AI'er","My family and I just returned from six nights at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana, and since I found so much helpful information in this sub-reddit I thought I would try to contribute with a review.

**Background:** My family and I generally do not vacation at all-inclusives; I have not been to one in almost twenty years.  We do lots of travel, including beach trips (Hawaii, Thailand, etc.), just not all-inclusives.  Perhaps this will be instructive for similar folks thinking about diving into the world of AIs.

We wanted to do a beach holiday during spring break (myself, wife, and two teens) and decided we wanted to solely relax at a beach and pool, so why not try an AI to do that?  Normally, we are pretty active in vacations - if visiting a tropical beach location, we would normally alternate between beach days and active/adventure days.

We were booking fairly last minute, especially for the peak of spring break travel, so the universe of AIs was not unlimited.  After looking at availability and reading plenty of information in this reddit, along with many youtube resort reviews, we settled on the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana, as it seemed to hit the most checkmarks for what we were looking for (nice beach, good pools, well maintained, higher end but not too luxe, good food quality, decent range of activities/entertainment, and not overcrowded).

This review focuses entirely on the Ziva side of the hotel.  As noted everywhere, the Hyatt has two sides - the Ziva for families, and the Zilara for adults 18+ only.  Other than a quick walk around the Zilara side, we did not eat or do anything there.

**Booking and transport:** We booked a junior king room, club level.  The price of the resort was definitely higher than anywhere else we looked; for comparison, the other finalist in our search, the Finest Punta Cana, was priced 35% lower during the same time.  Airport transfer is not included in the hotel cost, so you have to set that up separately.  Thankfully, you simply email the hotel, give them your flight information, and they will arrange the transport, so you don't have to worry or figure out what is a reputable company.  Cost was $120 round trip for the four of us.  You get taken directly to the hotel in a large well maintained SUV, and it is not a ride shared with others.  The trip to/from the airport is quick, about 15-20 minutes.

**Check-in:** Upon arrival at the Ziva, hotel staff immediately arrived to get our bags and welcome us.  Where you check in depends on if you are in a club level room or not.  If not, the bellhop will take you to the main check in desks, in the quite beautiful open air lobby.  The person greeting us asked our name, checked a list and noted we were in a club room, so he took us to the club lounge for check in.  Everyone so far had been very friendly.  Inside the club lounge is a full bar with higher end liquor and a super automatic coffee maker.  There is also a small buffet line that has various snacks and desserts that vary based on the time of day.

The lounge has about four couch areas where they sit you down for check in.  A check in person arrived and welcomed us to the Ziva, and gave us two pieces of paperwork to complete - reviewing the hotel rules and signing for and charging a card for the cost of the airport transport.  It was a quick and effective check in process, but I do want to point some variance from what I had read/seen in other reviews with club level.  1) We did not get a welcome champagne drink offered to us, and 2) we were not offered a concierge/butler for our stay.  We didn't particularly care as I would not have used a butler service to arrange things, but I did want to call it out in case someone cares a lot about it - it may not be happening consistently.

**Room:** The person who collected our bags initially then took us up to our room, a King room just above the lobby.  The room was as advertised if you have seen photos or videos - spacious at around 600 square feet, with generally good upkeep and a nice contemporary feel.  Bedding was comfortable, and there is a couch that turns into an extra bed (for our kids), which was actually more comfortable than I expected.  Most fold out beds are made such that you can feel the springs and the middle bar, but these are more like a futon that folds out, so the mattress was actually pretty decent (for a fold out bed, of course).  The mini fridge was stocked like you will see in the videos - 4-6 cans of Presidente beer, 2-4 juice boxes, 2 each of Sprite, Coke, and Coke Zero, 4 bottles of water, two mini cans of Pringles, two mini packs of Oreos, and two packs of peanut M&Ms.  The balcony was spacious, with a sprawling lounge couch, two chairs and a table.  The view looked straight over the beautiful grounds/pool of the Ziva and out to the ocean just beyond - really nice!

Bathroom was also large, with two separate sinks, a huge shower with both a rain shower head and a wand, and a separate water closet where the toilet is.  More bottled water was in the bathroom, as you will want to use that to brush your teeth, as use of the local water supply is not recommended.  Overall a nice bathroom, but this was the one spot where I could see some minor wear and tear - the bathroom mirror frames were getting a bit scratched/beaten up, some caulk in the water closet had worn away, and there a bit of not great repair work above a portion of the shower, where you can tell there was some kind of water leak but they did not do a great job of resurfacing the ceiling properly.  None of these were a problem, just highlighting that while the room was generally well maintained, it wasn't perfect.  Air conditioning worked perfectly - the room was cold, and it had no odor or musky smell that you sometimes get in a tropical room.  Overall, really happy with the room quality.

Housekeeping cleaned the rooms well every day, replaced towels with fresh ones, and restocked the mini fridge and snacks pretty consistently, though one day they did forget to restock some soda (one quick call to housekeeping and more was brought to our room within ten minutes).

**Hotel grounds -** In a word, immaculate.  I give the Ziva really high marks for keeping the place so darn clean and sparkling.  There was none, zero, trash or dirt to be found on the ground or surfaces, anywhere on the property.  They clearly had a lot of staff on the look out for empty drink cups, refuse, etc., because I just never saw any trash either on the ground or on tables.  The plants and grounds were maintained, well kept and very pretty.

**Pools -** There are two pools on the Ziva side - the main pool, and a pool for only club level guests.  The main pool is beautiful and fun - the snakes a path through the center of the property towards the ocean, and opens up into an infinity pool area at the end by the beach.  Again, clean and had a lot of interesting elements to it.  Of course it has a swim up bar.  The only downer for the pool is that there is a set of 2-3 foot high shrubs blocking the view of the ocean when you are in the pool. Guessing this is down to prevent beach erosion or keep sand from blowing into the pool, but it took away what otherwise would have been a wonderful ocean view.

The club pool is smaller, but still a pretty large size, and also has a swim up bar.  The bars serve slightly different specialty cocktails, and the club bar uses higher end liquor, but generally both made solid drinks - they were pretty well crafted, of course not as artisanal as a cocktail bar, but way better than I expected.  We were also surprised at the strength of them, as I assumed that AIs would just water down drinks as much as possible.  Not here.  The wait for a drink varied during the time of day, but was generally pretty quick.  I never waited more than 5 minutes to get a drink.  Pool servers did come around on a pretty regular basis (every 20 minutes or so), at least in the club area, to take drink/food orders, and they were generally pretty fast in bringing drinks back.

Both pools have a number of cabanas surrounding them that you can rent out for a full day.  When I was there, the cost was $199 per day, and they were sold out each day - if you want one and are coming during a peak season, I recommend getting the Ziva app well ahead of time, as it contains the ability to reserve one based on calendar openings.  The rental only gives you the cabana (i.e., they aren't throwing in a fruit basket or champagne like some hotels do, but then why would you need that at an AI?).

Overall, the pools exceeded our expectations - large, beautiful, well maintained, and never felt overcrowded (except for chairs - see below).

The pool deck chair situation is a bit different though - when at the hotel when it is fully booked like we were, be prepared to go down early in the morning to reserve deck chairs.  I am an early riser, and was always at the lobby coffee shop around when it opened at 6:30 AM, and a good number of chairs were always already taken each day.  By 8 AM nearly all of them were taken.  We always found a spot (by finding open chairs at around 7), but just a heads up it might require an early morning chair hunting exercise.  I wish there was a better way to alleviate beach chair stress, but I guess this is just the limitations of space at play.

**Activities:** Again, my family and I were mainly just looking to hang out at pools and beaches, so YMMV on if the Ziva has great entertainment.

There is a nice waterpark in the back of the property open from 10 to 5 - it is a five minute walk from the hotel pools to the waterpark - you cut through the hotel lobby to get to it.  It has a lazy river that loops around the waterpark, takes about five minutes, and is pretty fun - it has waterfall features, water cannons, etc. and a good mix of sun and shade while you go around.  There are four full sized waterslides - one is a large one that takes one or two person inner tubes, two pretty mild single person tube slides, and one more intense slide that is a very inclined drop of about 40 feet.  They all pretty fun and good for anyone probably over 10.  There is also a four lane gentle slide that many people were taking their handheld children down, and is fun to race folks if you have a group of four.  There are staff watching the big slides to try and ensure that there is spacing on the slides.  There is also a zero entry pool with mini slides and play structures for the under six set, and plenty of beach chairs to pick from on this side.  There are also two food trucks, one has soft serve ice cream, and the other has hot dogs, burgers, nachos and fries.

Near the waterpark is a kids club for ages under 12, and a teen zone for kids 12 to 17.  I believe the kids club is open most of the day, but the teen zone is only open from 3 to 9 PM.  I can't comment on either of these, because I had no kids under 12, and my teens had no interest in the teen zone, which has video games, air hockey, ping pong, a mini pool table, etc.

There are a number free water activities out on the beach - sea kayaks, stand up paddle boards, snorkels, and a small sailboat are offered at a hut by the Chinola restaurant.  We did the sea kayaking and it was fun and generally available anytime conditions allowed.  We did not snorkel as the ocean area in front of the hotel is extremely shallow and seemingly devoid of fish, so it would be pretty boring snokeling I think.  The sailboat needs to be reserved in advance given its popularity, so visit the water activities hut asap if you are looking to use it.  Be warned that they are very conservative on closing down water activities - half of the days we were there they closed it down due to ""high winds"", but my definition of windy must be different as the days were crystal clear and not any type of strong ocean breeze in my opinion.

There is one beach volleyball net and a beach soccer goal - I did not use these but imagine the balls used would be obtained from the water activities desk.

The Ziva app has about 4-5 rotating daily activities, such as craft cocktail making, art projects (sometimes for adults, sometimes for kids), kid cupcake making, evening kids movies on the lawn, etc.  There are supposedly rainy day activities, but it was clear skies the whole time we were there so I am not sure what those would entail.  Each night had two activities at the Marquis Theatre, which is an open air pavilion that straddles the Ziva and Zilara sides, right next to the sports bar.  Each night has a different show, usually either a magic show, variety show, or tribute concert (it was Queen and Michael Jackson when we were there), with an hour or so of either karaoke or silent disco before the main show.  We did not go any of them, but you can hear them around the property when they occur - they sounded pretty cheesy, but were probably fun for those that enjoy some schmaltz.

**Beach -** The beach is east facing, so you get wonderful sunrises!  It is a very wide strip of white sand, and unlike the pool area, there are plenty of chairs available, though the ones closest to the ocean will get reserved early.  However there was usually a hotel guard out there, and he seemed very active in moving chairs around for folks, helping to move and open the beach umbrellas, etc.  There were some servers that took drink orders, but it seemed pretty random versus a consistent service out there.  Chairs are the same as the pool, which were comfy, padded loungers in great condition.

There is no getting around it - the beach area has seaweed, even in low seaweed season that we were in (March).  There is a seaweed barrier about 50 yards offshore that keeps a decent amount out, but still a some gets through, floats in the water and collects on the beach.  The hotel appears to be doing all they can to minimize it with the barrier, and they had a tractor out every morning trying to collect as much as they can off the beach.  But to be clear, you are not getting any section near the water that is devoid of seaweed.  Further, a lot of the swimmable water area has seaweed on the seabed, so it doesn't make for super great swim times.  The water is beautiful though, with a tropical blue gradient.  However, with the seaweed and the super shallowness of the water (it doesn't get deeper than 4 feet until almost at the seaweed barrier) means most folks are not spending much time swimming or exploring the ocean.

**Food and Restaurants -** As mentioned, we only ate on the Ziva side, so I can't comment on the Zilara restaurants.  But as for the Ziva, generally the food was mediocre at best, even coming in with expectations that food at an all inclusive will not match a standalone restaurant.  I came in not expecting much, and yet was still hugely disappointed.  This was a bummer given everything we had read that Ziva had some of the best AI food out there.  I would hate to see what a step down in food quality is if that is case.

Tempest Table - This is the Japanese/Mongolian spot where you either get table service or teppan style hibachi service.  We did both, and it was probably the best spot we ate at.  We did menu service once - I got the sweet and sour duck, which was fine.  My wife got the wok shrimp pops, which were supposed to be shrimp with a crispy wok fried breaded crust - wow, what a mistake.  These things came out soggy, soft, and looked literally like grubs.  Inedible and gross to look at - we could not believe this was being served.  My kids had a vegan poke bowl which was pretty good though - basic but at least the vegetables were fresh and of good quality.  My other child had the Mongolian grill, where you pick your protein, veggies, and sauce and they cook them up on a grill.  They had chicken, beef, duck, shrimp, and other seafood to pick from - this was also a pretty safe bet and was not bad.

Service was strange, and was a theme at almost every restaurant - dishes would come out randomly; two main courses would come out first, followed by an appetizer, followed by someone else's main ten minutes later, followed by the rest of the appetizers.  I am not sure if this is just a feature of AI restaurants, but the flow of dinners was just plain weird and haphazard.  Each restaurant at the Ziva has a few specialty cocktails.   The sake and green tea mojito was solid, the other two (geisha and sake one) were things that might have seemed great when I was drinking underage in college, but rather nasty as an adult.

The hibachi teppan tables were the best meals we had on the property.  There are only three of them, so there was usually a 30-45 minute wait to get a seat, whereas every other time we at there was no wait (which was pretty great! I thought we would always be in for a wait given the hotel was full).  This is standard Benihana style hibachi cooking of rice, veggies, steak, chicken and shrimp.  Perhaps because it is so straightforward it was hard to mess up, but this was the best thing we had.  Pretty disappointing that bog standard chain restaurant style food was the best, but there you go.  One time we had it, they gave us a nice miso soup appetizer; the other time, no soup.  There was a tempura ice cream monstrosity they served afterwards that was a complete mess.

Noodle and Thread - This is the Italian restaurant, and hoo boy, it is bad.  Only one redeeming item was eaten here, and that was a basic caprese salad appetizer.  Everything else was really, really bad.  Do you like pizza so undercooked you get mouthfuls of raw dough?  How about braised beefs ribs that are tough, flavorless and dripping in a gross and unattractive mystery sauce?  What about a chicken parmigiana that is soggy, fatty, and sitting on a bed of the worst spaghetti possible?  Noodle and Thread has you covered wall to wall with bad food! This place made The Olive Garden seem like a two star Michelin restaurant in comparison.  Specialty drinks were horrid.  We left before seeing what horrors awaited us for dessert.

Navigator Grill - This is an open air restaurant near the pools, and I guess is a general surf and turf restaurant.  The appetizers that we had here were decent (beet salad, fish tacos, calamari rings), but all of the main dishes were just off - either seasoned oddly (grilled mahi mahi), cooked poorly (grilled rib eye), or potentially having bad seafood in it (linguini and clams).  Similar to the other restaurants, the specialty cocktails here were all out of balance and not good.  Lunch is offered here, and was borderline inedible - really bad churrasco and a seafood stew that was entirely off in terms of flavors and seasoning.

El Mercado Buffet - We never ate a full dinner here, but did get desserts one night and looked at all of the stations.  I will say it has a huge amount of items, and while some may not like it, I liked that almost everything is behind glass (requiring you to ask a server to scoop what you want).  It kept the presentation of everything looking great, instead of the mess that can happen at a lot of buffets.  Desserts were fine (they had a crepe station, which tasted good, but they just have a stack of pre-made crepes that they briefly warm up rather than cook to order), and I grabbed a burger and some fried plantain chips with my dessert, and both were decent.

Breakfast had a similar huge array of items, including a station of fresh juices that was nice.  However, as is the theme, everything we ate at breakfast was just off.  Omelets were overcooked and had strange flavor, waffles and pancakes were premade and just served soggily out of a warming bin; breads were pretty tasteless.  Coffee was bad.  They at least had a mimosa cart at the entrance if that is your thing.  Overall, there wasn't bad quality or lack of cleanliness here, it just seems like basic cooking execution and flavoring things properly are way off.

Prontoz - This is the quick snack restaurant out by the pool, serving hamburgers, pizza and the like.  We got pizza and fries here a few times while at the pool.  Unlike the formal Italian restaurant that served raw pizza dough, Prontoz knew how to properly cook a pizza, and it was okay - it is super doughy versus thin/crispy, so you may enjoy it more if you like a thicker style of pizza.  Fries were cooked well and tasted great.

Poolside Grill - At lunch each day, they had a grill going outside of the Navigator restaurant serving burgers and BBQ chicken.  This was by far the best lunch food we had - the burger was good and the BBQ chicken was, while nothing out of the ordinary, solid.

Chinola - Chinola is a club-level only restaurant for breakfast and lunch, while open to everyone at dinner. This was our favorite breakfast and lunch spot aside from the grill.  Options here are lighter/healthier fare than anywhere else on property.  The egg omelet and cinnamon pancakes were pretty good for breakfast, and they offered several different healthy juice smoothies that were alright.  For lunch they had a lot of fresh fish and salad options - the mahi mahi dish was good, while a whitefish dish was horrid.  The avocado salad and salmon salads were refreshing and tasty though.

Coffee Republic - This is the full service coffee spot in the main lobby.  It offers a full array of specialty coffee drinks and coffee milkshakes that the Starbucks set will enjoy.  Espresso drinks here were generally good, but plan accordingly based on when you go.  It opens at 6:30 AM, and from about 6:40 to 7:30 there will usually be a line of 5-10 people waiting to order.  They only have 2-3 people working the whole station so drinks will take upwards of 20 minutes if you go during a busy time.  After 8 it seems to thin out quite a bit.  They also serve breakfast pastries like croissants, tarts and breads that are okay.  In the afternoon they also serve popsicles and ice cream - there are about five popsicle flavors and 6-7 ice cream flavors, and they change about one of those each day for a minimal amount of variety.

Room service - We tried breakfast one day, and it was solid - we got the Hyatt breakfast, which is large breakfast plate with eggs, bacon, breads, pancakes, and toast.  It was what you expect from a hotel room service, but everything was tasty and fresh.  We also ordered a burger and few desserts one night, and the burger was decent.  Not a bad option if your main dinner goes awry.

Every server at all of these places was very nice and seemed happy to be there, so despite the strange way service often happens, at least it always happens with a smile.

There is one restaurant that charges an extra fee, The Blind Butcher, which offers a premium meal with dancers and entertainment.  We skipped it based on word of mouth at the resort that its food quality was not anything beyond the normal restaurants, and it was $150 a head.  No thanks.

**Bars and Drinks -** As mentioned above, poolside bars provided good, quick service and well made cocktails - I was surprised and impressed by this!

Also as mentioned, almost all of the specialty cocktails in the restaurants were really not good.  I would recommend getting a cocktail from the rum bar that is just outside of the restaurants (Grog Grotto).  We tried about 5 of the 10 cocktails on their menu, and they were all strong, tasty and well made (in particular we like the El Papelon).  I would say get a drink from there and take it into your restaurant; often the servers would notice that it was a Grog Grotto drink and would ask if we wanted another one from there, and send someone out to get it and bring back to us in the restaurant - that was great.

The lobby bar (Twisted Timbers) was also generally not busy and made a solid mojito and other cocktails.  All bars seemed to be using at worst mid-grade liquor and often premium, which no doubt was helping to make cocktails generally a great experience.  Wine is a different story - they only offer a basic red or white, and both are pretty bad.  If you like wine they offer a huge array for an extra charge at all restaurants and bars, and the pricing is 5-6x the retail price, so a bad deal all around for wine lovers at the Ziva.

**Service** \- Everyone at the property was very nice and willing to help if you needed it.  I asked a front desk clerk how to get to the waterpark the first day we were there, and he walked us all the way over there.  All servers, bartenders, groundskeepers, housekeeping, etc. were all pleasant and friendly.

One note - outside of the buffet at breakfast each morning is where a group of men trying to sell you timeshares set up shop.  They will follow you for about 15-20 seconds asking you to sign up for their pitch, up to and including walking to the threshold of elevators.  This is pretty annoying when you leave the buffet each morning, but my elevator bank also happened to be there, so I would get pestered multiple times a day.  I cannot believe this nonsense happens when paying for such a high end resort.  By day five, the salesmen finally remembered that I had said no a dozen times already and finally left me alone.  Not a huge deal, but just tacky and takes away the otherwise relaxing vibe of the place.

**TLDR/Overall -**  We had a great time at the Ziva; the hotel itself and grounds are beautiful and immaculately maintained, the view is lovely, and the vibes are chill.  I do not regret going for a second.  I enjoyed it and found it to be a fun and relaxing place to be.

However, would I go back?  Personally, no, I would not - this may be more that I am not ""in the AI life"", because I cannot get past how generally bad the food was.  When you are at an AI, food is one of the main pillars (room/hotel quality, pool/beach, food, drinks) - tough to really, really call it a success when your family kind of dreads the next meal.  But it was an across the board problem at the Ziva, so I don't think it was a one-off bad luck week while we were there.  I would say if you enjoy AIs and can manage the food expectations better than I, the Ziva would be an unqualified recommendation.",4,1743721800.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

I have spent the last decade of my life with you as the candy apple of my eye. And I know that we've failed each other on multiple levels. I'm not comparing piles of shit, but I'm sure we can both guess whose is bigger. I don't want to point fingers. I don't want to place blame. I simply want to put it all out there, on the table, bare so we can not repeat these cycles we always put ourselves through. So we can write our boundaries down that we agree to and put em on the fridge as our first contract we've made to one another. Hopefully, the second is marriage with the family and everything.

I've got a job like you asked, big check is getting sent out Monday, I'm ready to support you as you did me during my dark times to heal. My birthday is coming up soon and all I want is you for it. That's church, beb. Step up, what I'd honestly prefer, or step off. I have needs in life I have to address and I pray to God you can join me as I fulfill them. It's always been you, nobody else but you.

I'm going to delete this app for good. You told me that it was here that you lost your touch with reality. I have tried tirelessly to get you back in touch with it for months. Much to my own self sacrifice. But ya know what? You're worth it. I've scaled more of your walls and have broken down more of your barriers than anyone else. And if all of my efforts through all of our years together are not worth a call or text to make plans to sit down and hash this out then that's on you. I have to get off of here before I fall victim to the same disassociation that you've professed to me. I love you, and I've never stopped loving you, beb.

As I sip my coffee around good friends and wait to go back out on Saturday, know this. I will always be here for you. It's just that I can't keep waiting for words of affirmation, my primary love language, from you any further. I have to live my own life at some point in time. I have to find new friends, relationships and love that nurtures my growth and betterment. I will thrive, and it will suck not having you by my side to partake in it.

Shit or get off the pot, beb. I think my love, dedication and work have shown enough proof that you can trust me with you. And I mean olive you. I love you morer, and that's a got dam fact.

Happens to the best of us! But what if we tried something a bit different for the next three days?

I’m talking about **time blocking.** You’ve heard of it, right? Think of it as the grown-up, sophisticated cousin of to-do lists. It’s like telling time who’s boss rather than letting your tasks boss you around.

**So, here’s the challenge:** Replace your trusty old to-do list with time blocking for just three days. I’m talking full immersion here!

- **Day 1: Test the Waters**  
  Start by identifying key tasks you MUST complete. *Coffee first.* Then grab a planner, use your phone, or even a Google Calendar. Allocate specific chunks of time to each task. 🎯 “From 9:00 to 9:45, I’m all about that email grind.”

- **Day 2: Adjust and Adapt**  
  Day 1 may feel a bit awkward—like new jeans that are just a tad too tight. But stay with me! On Day 2, refine your schedule based on what didn't quite work the first day. Need a snack break between deep work sessions? Pencil it in. *Pro tip: Don't forget human needs, like food or, you know, a bathroom break. 😉

- **Day 3: Groove into It**  
  By Day 3, you might just find yourself in a flow. Tasks feel less like boxes to tick and more like conscious choices on how you spend your precious hours. Celebrate even small victories—whether it’s nailing a deadline or avoiding that mid-afternoon slump.* 🎉

Why does this work? When you block time, you’re not just deciding what to do, but also *when* and *for how long.* It’s like giving your brain a game plan rather than an overwhelming suggestion box.

Is it going to change your life in three days? Maybe not. But it could be a start. You might discover a whole new way of owning your day. What have you got to lose, really?

I cant watch the newer episodes. Theyre cheap and bland.  Every idea has been run through the machine. I think a lot of people will say its when Christopher Meloni left but i feel like there was some good episodes after that still. I think i really quit when they brought back Richard for a second time 🙄 they really milked that cow and i think i just got annoyed. Anyway i don’t think iv seen anything past that. There are a lot of reasons The older episodes are better. But a reason that sticks out to me is the nostalgia of the show. It is so clear cut early 90s vibes and that gives  the show depth and makes it girtty. The late nights, the bad coffee. sleeping in the bullpen. Stress. Angst. It was all part of the atmosphere that made it such a captivating show. I also think that the show went downhill when they revamped the SVU office and made it modern. It took away the gritty. You wouldn’t see batman fighting crime in sunny California. It didn’t seem right to see the SVU detectives working in such a sleek office. These are just my thoughts what are yours?

The first vendor we're trying to choose is catering. 

This seems dumb... but how do I pick a caterer before I know *exactly* what I want? The main things I'm unsure of are: 

* coffee service
* champagne toast
* open bar vs. beer, wine, & 2-3 cocktails
* extra dessert vs. cake only

We've gotten a few quotes already, but I'm nervous about picking something too soon, paying deposits, and then not being able to make changes to the services as the wedding planing begins to come together.

After paying a deposit, are you stuck to all the line items on the contract? Or will caterers make changes and adjust your final payment?",2,1743721012.0,weddingplanning,5,1.0,False
