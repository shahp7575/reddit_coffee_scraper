Any advice on how to have a more positive view on this situation or how to deal with this is very appreciated.

I work in IT, 38 hours a week from home, Monday through Friday. She works as a server in a fine dining restaurant averaging around 50 hours a week with two days off. Her days off can be anywhere during the week, depending on the schedule her boss makes for that week. Usually, I work from 9AM - 4PM, she works from either 12AM - 10PM or 4PM until 2AM, so either way while she is at home, the most we get to do before she has to leave for work is have lunch or breakfast together. Whenever I am free and not actively need to be doing anything for work, I try to spend some time with her before she has to go work.

Due to her working late, she also tends to get out of bed only a few hours before she has to leave for work again - I do not have any issue with this, as she should be getting a long sleep after working so late. On days she does get up earlier, she spends most of her time playing some multiplayer game with her friends online. She does that until she has to start and get dressed for work. While she plays, she also does not respond to me talking to her directly as she seems to be super focused on her game. She drinks coffee and most of the time she leaves the mug wherever she finished drinking it. She eats and the plate is left where she finishes eating it or places it on the sink even though the dish washer is empty.

I have talked to her about this a few times, that it bothers me, that she leaves dirty dishes all over the place but she says she was in a hurry before leaving for work. This hasn't changed after a few conversations with her. Simply leaving all the dishes around the house does not solve the issue either, as there will just be more and more places i find dirty plates and coffee mugs at. This really makes me feel like she only thinks of me as the person that can clean up after her because I work from home and have ""so much free time"" anyway. I understand that working a desk job is not comparable to working as a server but the mental stress IT work puts on you is a lot as well, so I do not want to be seeing all the stuff I have to clean up first thing after finishing work. I had stopped cleaning the floor for a while - it did not bother her when there was dirt and her dark hair was all over the floor. It usually stays that way until I clean it.

She sometimes cooks for us but often times the food turns out burnt. Whenever she makes herself a snack, the bread crumps and plastic packaging of whatever she ate is left on the counter. She prefers me to cook. I do love cooking, so I do not have any issue with that.

She loves shoes, so she does have lots of pairs. Many of which she leaves the way she takes them off at the front door so there is a huge pile of shoes there. Whenever I tidy it up, it turns right back into a huge mess a few days later.

Her contribution to the household is washing clothes (only after they pile up after 2 weeks or longer), going grocery shopping with me once a week, and cooking 1-2 times a week. The rest is left to me and whenever I ask her if she could help out, she says she already cleaned X but it was actually me who did it or she is too tired from work.

When she gets home from work, I am happy to see her. She gives me a kiss and then changes into more comfortable clothes. As she is a smoker and I prefer she not smoke inside, the next thing she does is go outside, smoke and play her game again until she has to go sleep, which usually is way past my bedtime, as I have to get up for work earlier than she does.

I make around 60% of our household income while she does 40% (tips excluded, she only uses that money for herself, which I have no issue with).

Often, I feel like I have to go out of my way and ask her many times to watch a movie with me or to go out. When watching a movie, she usually gets bored after a few minutes and wants to go back to playing her game.

When we go on vacation, most of the planning is done by me and when something goes wrong, it is also my fault or if I forget something, it's always ""I thought you would..."".

This way of living with her frustrates me a lot, as I feel like she prioritizes her game and work over me. I have told her this a few times but it is hard talking to her about this. I try to avoid expressions like ""you should"", ""i want you to"", ""you do x wrong"" and instead try to explain the way I feel in certain situations. Her usual answer to try to end these kinds of conversations are ""you should go and find a new girlfriend, then"".

What bothers me so much is that she works 10 hours a day, has to drive to and from work for another hour and plays her game for another 4 hours at minimum daily and she can't find the time to clean up after herself or do household chores. It makes me feel resentful towards her and on days I clean and tidy up the house, I sometimes feel like I want to break up. She wants children, I want / wanted children as well but to me it sometimes feels like I already live with someone who has not grown past their teens yet. The bedroom is kind of dead(-ish) as well - we have sex once a month, at most. It's now been 3 months. She used to tells me, she does not need it. She watches porn and uses her vibrator after waking up almost daily. I do not understand how making children is supposed to work that way, and I am not sure if it makes sense to have children anymore at all. I've been rejected so many times that I rarely even try anymore and when we do do it, it is mostly me being active. This makes me feel really bad, as I do not want to be sleeping with someone who does not want me. Physical touch and quality time really makes me feel loved but she does not seem to be putting much effort into any of these things.

This is my first time living with someone other than my parents and it is her first time living alone. I haven't been in many relationships before and she hasn't either, so It would really be great to have some insight from some more experienced people than me.

1iqcmyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1iqcmyw/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I’ve don’t worry think I want to have kids. I think they’re so cute but in a way that I would love to hold a baby and dress them in cute outfits and then go home and sleep for 10 hours straight and make myself a coffee in a quiet house. I also have NEVER wanted to be pregnant. Every new thing I learn about pregnancy just adds to my fear of it. My mom was pregnant with my sisters (twins) and they all nearly died because of a condition they had. All her doctors recommended she terminate the pregnancy. Almost every mother I know has a pregnancy/birth horror story where they nearly died or where some horrible surprise medical event happened.

I’m an engineer and I also don’t want to have put in all this effort for my degree and my career just to stop and stay home and be treated like I’m just relaxing at home and not working. The other day my mom made a comment that showed she just assumed that I would indeed one day have kids and that I would also stay home with them. I will most likely be the breadwinner so why would I stay home?

My biggest BIGGEST reason for making this post though is the political climate in the US right now. I don’t have sex and I’m not in a relationship so the chances are VERY slim of me becoming pregnant, but I don’t want to die because I get raped in a red state and can’t access the healthcare I need. I live in a blue state now but a bill for a federal abortion ban was just introduced and if it goes through, I will NOT become an incubator. ** also to clarify - I’m not on BC and I don’t plan to go on it. I don’t wanna deal with the laundry list of symptoms, and my periods completely regular so there’s not much motivating me to get on it **

It seems like I have all boxes checked for a bisalp, but why am I so wary? I’ve never had surgery so it could be that. Am I worried about possibly regretting it? Even if I do decide to have kids, I would adopt. I have thought about fostering and (maybe) adopting children once I have a more stable income and housing situation and I’ll be able to provide for them, but with the way the economy is, I’m not sure that’ll happen. I also dont want to NOT get it and then be unable to get it two years from now because of the antics of this administration. 

Anyways, I’m sorry this post was so long. I just wanted to provide some context for my thought process. When did you guys decide to pull the trigger? Did you worry about it the same way? Do you worry about it still, even after the surgery?",1,1739656685.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

The Vienna Derby is upon us, folks! Austria Wien vs Rapid Wien, a matchup that's almost as old as the feuds between the city's coffee shop owners.

Given the odds, it seems like the bookies are having a hard time picking a favorite. Austria Wien is slightly favored, with prices ranging from 2.23 (BetRivers) to 2.45 (Bovada, DraftKings, BetUS), while Rapid Wien is hovering around 2.8-3.1. The draw is, well, drawing attention with prices between 3.15 and 3.3.

Since underdogs win about 41% of the time in soccer, I'd say Rapid Wien has a decent shot at pulling off an upset. However, considering the head-to-head prices, I'd recommend taking Austria Wien to win, but only if you can get them at 2.45 or higher.

As for the totals, the over/under 2.5 goals market is almost evenly split, with prices ranging from 1.81 (BetRivers) to 1.93 (LowVig.ag) for the under. Given the intensity of the Vienna Derby, I'd lean towards the over, but it's a tough call.

My best bet? Take Austria Wien to win at 2.45 (Bovada, DraftKings, BetUS), but don't expect a blowout. This one's gonna be a close, gritty match with plenty of yellow cards and possibly a few red ones. Prost!",1,1739656478.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False
1iqci2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1iqci2i/am_i_the_asshole/,Am I the asshole?,"Hey guys, 

So today I ended up getting into quite a heated argument at the driving range. My friends and I went the range to hit a few balls and have a game on Toptracer. Like most driving ranges, the standard bays are pretty small so when available we tend to use the larger 2 bays at the end of the range. 

Today, the majority of the bays were full but we managed to get three bays all next to each other at the end just next to the larger bays. However, one of the larger bays was empty and someone had just left their clubs in the bay with no balls. 

15 or so minutes go by and there’s no sign of anyone coming back to use the larger bay. I asked around to see if it was being used and was told someone came in and dropped their clubs off and went to get a coffee at the nearby Starbucks. 

Given people were queuing for bays at the range and myself and my friends were taking up three bays, and it obvious no one was returning to the larger bay anytime soon, I moved the guys clubs into one of the smaller bays we were in and we all moved into the larger bay. 

The guy finally came back after about 30 minutes and started kicking off that I shouldn’t have moved his clubs which I understand but I said you can’t drop your clubs off in one of the only two larger bays and disappear to get a coffee. He then proceeded to try and start a fight over this, but this left me wondering am I the one in the wrong? ",2,1739656473.0,golf,13,0.75,False

he hasn't got as much time for me because he's in college, studying a super demanding career. someweeks we wouldn't meet and i wouldn't even recieve a text from him. i hated this SO much and i told him so, i told him how much i suffered, how alone i felt and that i needed him. and today he's decided to break up with me because, according to him, he doesn't want me to keep suffering because he can't keep me company like i need him to. he told me that this was the best decision possible, that although he did not want this, it's best for us in the long run because if we kept going in this path, I'd hate him forever

being with him has always felt like a breath of fresh air after not being able to breathe. it felt like he was one of the only people i could rely on and talk honestly about anything and everything. and now i don't have that anymore. he wants us to remain friends, but we've been together so long that i don't think i could possibly do it.

he was my first everything and after imagining a life with him, i don't think i could possibly see him as a friend anymore. he comes over for family lunch, we've been on vacation together (even with his family, TWICE), I've told him my darkest fears. i couldn't bear the thought of him being and living the life I'd imagine for us with someone else. 

I'm honestly so heartbroken that i don't know what to do. i don't know how I'll be able to show up on monday knowing that he'll be there. i don't know how I'll tell our friends or my family. I don't know how I'll be able to move on after him.

- Instead of one big canister of instant coffee, get the Folgers teabag coffees that each come in their own package. 

- Instead of a big tub of sunscreen, try picking up smaller tubes from check out aisles or bargain bins.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

It's 2025 and we still have the audacity to bash the poor old news and journalists (the backbone of this country). Any anti semitic attack needs to be treated without any bias, and the victim needs to be believed no matter what.

This type of heresy is the worst kind. There's a lot of sensitive geopolitical issues surrounding this current thing. All this is gonna do cultivate hate and mistrust Aussie's have for our media. Now guys, please always, always believe the victim. The news and Judaism have been through too much. Respect the traditional custodians of other countries, period.

We are looking to change our coffee machine from a Nespresso to a Espresso machine. After some research, I am aiming at a semi auto machine since I have the following requirements:

\-Reliable: I am just not ready to spend 1500$ and cross my fingers it won't break after 4 years of use. From what I can see, it does not matter what brand I take, even a 3000$ Jura , FullAutomatic machine are less reliable due to the higher amount of pieces susceptible to break. As convenient it is to have auto grinder or set of preferences, I will have to go without it.

\-I drink mainly espresso (about twice a day), but my wife will take 3 or 4 Long Coffee (1 caff en 3 decaff). If I understand correctly, I should not just pour a 300 ml of coffee, but have one shot of Espresso and add hot water. Cool, but that means that I need a hot water dispenser? Any tips for this?

\-Need to fit a +350ml cup.

\-I don't care about milk stuff.

\-Under 1000$CAD/700$USD budget

One sibling is a hoarder and I don't make them feel bad about it. If they want help cleaning, I help, if they don't I don't. This usually equates to tossing obvious trash from their kitchen and coffee table so we have space to cook or eat. If a friend wants to send me pics of stuff they like or bought, I give them props.

My own space is minimal in part because I want to be able to keep it clean with minimal effort and minimal thought. My clothes are minimal so I don't have to think about what to wear or keep up with trends. My place looks nice. I got enough standard items that if someone comes to visit they don't have complaints, aside from not having a tv, but anyone can stream to a tablet or laptop if it's important to them

I've been in a very long term relationship before so it's not that I lack social skills or refuse to adjust to others. I just can't seem to get interested in someone as a partner when they have consumer fantasies about their life and future. It feels like a burden I don't want to take on since I don't share the values. I also just think, I'd have to put in a lot of effort to maintain this person. Cleaning up after them. Playing therapist. They'd have opinions on how I should max out my physical attractiveness on a regular basis while I just want to be neutral. 

I'll try any new thing that doesn't obligate me in invest much upfront, own more things, cause damage, or wrong others. So I'm the friend people call for randomness they want company for. It can be spontaneous or planned. It can require work, time, fitness, an open mind, or emotional support. I took care of someone till they died. I've helped remodel. I've joined errands. 

Obviously I couldn't be with a hoarder, but it seems like the standard discontent consumerism people tend to have is something I don't want to take into a relationship or my home. 

I'm alright on my own.

I’m often so busy that I don’t have the chance to make friends and build that community where I live. The nature of my work doesn’t allow me to travel frequently, and I’ve been searching for an SB who would like to get together almost exclusively here in Chicago, where I live.

As someone newer to this, the conversations I’ve had with SBs tend to be a mismatch. I often hear a desire for a more lavish lifestyle together, taking trips away from here, and doing things that are genuinely inconvenient for me personally. I’m not in a phase of life where I have tons of free time, and I would love to find a connection that’s lowkey, down to earth, and vulnerable. 

I want someone who I can take for coffee or lunch during my workday, and who will be there for me if I’m having a tough day. I want someone with a life outside of our own, who might not always be available for me. Specifically, I’m not interested in a sexual relationship. The most I’m comfortable with is cuddling with someone. I’m not doing this for romance, and it seems like a lot of people are. 

Is it abnormal to get into the SD/SB dynamic to have a more platonic friend? Someone that you’re comfortable with having other relationships outside of your own? I’d really love to just have a confidant and friend here in the city I live.

1iqbq1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iqbq1c/i_accidentally_led_someone_on_and_he_has_a_crush/,"I accidentally led someone on and he has a crush on me, but I've rejected him. Now he's coming over for dinner. This is long, so brace in.","So this began almost a year ago, when my friends (Let's call him John) mom (call her Natasha) said he liked that he always hung out with me because it was hard for him to make friends. I lied and said we were close. We weren't, but I was such a people pleaser and smooth talking, that it ended up being too smooth. Why?

Because he was the friend of a friend, and that friend we had in common was my crush (Call him Cole). We weren't that close either, because I was friends with his sister (call her Alli), not him. Also, he sees me as his little sister, which frustrated me, but I've gotten over it.

Mostly.

But that's not the point. The point is that I decided to get closer to him because he almost never spoke. He either nodded or picked his nose, which gave me a major sense of ick. So I talked to his brother (call him Adrian). Everything went well, until my sister blurted out one day that we were at his house that I preferred Adrian over John. So he started avoiding me.

I felt like a major piece of crap, so I apologized. But then I smooth talked too much again, and got John to believe I liked him instead of Cole. Now we're messy. Cole's turning 18. He's leaving for college soon. So last year we held a grad party for him and some of his classmates (it's a small town). I danced twice with Cole and flirted with him, but he shot me down.

I was disappointed so I asked one of his friends to dance. He called John over, but they started talking so I left. I don't know what he said to John, but he was circling me like a hawk and with a weird smirk on his face that made me gag.

Whatever.

Then I asked another friend. He called John over and they forced me to dance with him while they watched and laughed. He's the worst dancer. After we both got humiliated on the dance floor, we called it a truce.

But it's not over.

My family sent over to his house for brunch. We were teaching one of his friends to play chess. We ended playing chess and he won. And he gave me the effing smirk.

""Guess you owe me.""

When he said that, I acted like it slid right off. But it didn't. We had lunch and he sat right across me and he kept smiling. After he saw I ignored him, fearing I was leading him on, he left to play video games with his brother.

But now his parents and my parents think we're the best of friends. So my parents decided to invite him for dinner. At my house. What lead them to thinking this?

His parents opened a coffee shop and I went in good graces with our friends to the opening night. Since it was just for us, me and Cole danced again, and Cole said he likes the way I dance. But Alli said: ""Hands off. He's leaving soon and he has a future that cannot be ruined by anything or anyone.""

Damn, girl, fine! Truce!

So John decided to make his move on me. ""You want chocolate?""

""No.""

""You want a mocktail?""

""No.""

""Want more bread?""

""How about you pay attention to your own table? I said no!"" Silence. Great, now I hurt his feelings. Then I danced with Cole again and John left. I felt bad, but I was with Cole and Cole wanted to invite me to a concert. I did it! But now I find myself missing John. Great.

So my dad invited his dad and his family over to my house. First it was supposed to be on the 9th. They were busy because John and Adrian were going to the movies and they were chaperoning.

How about the 16th? We're hosting family.

So now they're coming on the 23rd and we're on bad terms because I tried talking to him, and he turned away from me and left. Who's in the wrong here? Because I feel really, really, guilty.",3,1739654427.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

The system was designed in such a way that if it were to fail ‘safely,' no one would be made aware. And it did fail.

\---

Life, in its most stubborn forms, can defy reason. It can thrive under crushing pressure, extreme temperatures, and immense radiation. It clings to vents spewing superheated water, rich in minerals and laced with toxic gases—places where human understanding of biological persistence begins to falter. Scientists have named these organisms 'extremophiles'; but on a cosmic scale, they are statistically unimpressive.

Humans couldn’t help themselves, unable to resist poking these organisms with a proverbial stick, not out of curiosity but to see if they could use them for something. They set to work collecting, dissecting, modifying, and cataloging. Could they survive even harsher conditions? Could they be engineered into something useful? Could they, perhaps, make someone very rich? These were the important questions.

At approximately 75°S, 135°W, buried beneath kilometers of Antarctic ice, a small research team was stationed at a deep-sea facility perched on the edge of a sub-glacial trench. Below, hydrothermal vents bled heat into freezing water and fed organisms that had never even seen the sun. Above, another form of life adapted, not to heat and pressure, but supply chain failures and isolation.

Among the station's daily routines, nothing felt more stable than the arrival of a shipping manifest. A precise list, delivered like clockwork, documenting exactly what was expected. Reeve scanned the usual list of provisions and equipment, his eyes skimming over them to land on something unexpected.

Provisions:

* ‘Heat-n-Eat’ Meals – 450 units (Total weight: 250 kg)
* Powdered Milk – 10 containers (Total weight: 10 kg)
* Freeze-Dried Coffee – 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)
* Peppermints – 6 packs (Total weight: 3 kg)

Medical Supplies:

* Antibiotics – 20 blister packs, 20 vials (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* NSAIDs – 4 bulk bottles (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* Sterile Bandages – 40 rolls (Total weight: 3 kg)

Equipment:

* Air Filters – 18 units (Total weight: 9 kg)
* Oxygen Canisters – 20 units (Total weight: 60 kg)
* Reinforced Tubing – 50 meters (Total weight: 80 kg)

Miscellaneous:

* Office Supplies - 20 pens, 10 notepads, 5 reams of paper (Total weight: 5 kg)
* Entertainment Media – 5 encrypted drives, 10 books (Total weight: 3 kg)
* Inflatable Santa Claus (Light-Up) – 1 unit (Total weight: 4 kg)

""One inflatable Santa Claus,"" he sputtered in confusion.

He began to sift through the delivery until he found it. Buried beneath the vacuum sealed foodstuffs was a full-size, self-inflating, light-up Santa Claus. While this could be a clerical error, or possibly a prank from the supply depot to send Christmas decorations in March, there was no immediate discernible reason for it to be included. Reeve flipped to the attached requisition form and ran his finger down the neatly itemized requests. Sure enough, *someone* had requested it, but there was no name attached and no indication of who thought that it was a necessary addition. He became visibly tense, clenching the clipboard a little tighter while cross referencing the manifest and requisition form. It was real. More importantly, **it was here.**

Reeve was not the type of person to overlook these kinds of details. He was not the smartest person in the room by a long shot, but he was thorough: the kind of man who felt that small mistakes would cascade into big ones if you were to let them slide or go unnoticed. He knew nothing of the research that was conducted in the facility, he was there for something he deemed much more important: **inventory management.** Stock counts, requisitions, and organization—these were things that made sense to him. If there was something arriving in the shipment that was detailed in both the manifest and requisition form, it should be *needed.* If something was not required, there had to be an explanation. He took pride in his ability to catch errors and to spot inconsistencies. That was his job, that's why he was here. Yet, against all logic, there it was. An inflatable idol of holiday-focused consumerism and seasonal obligation. Its blank, joyous expression a hollow sentiment to its own existence.

He rubbed his fingers across his brow forcefully and flipped back from the requisition form to the manifest. Reeve had a process: verify, double-check, move on. The Santa Claus was accounted for after all. Meticulously he verified that everything had arrived as expected. His eyes passed between the shipment and the manifest, checking off each item as he confirmed it. Once he had reviewed everything, he froze. The clipboard shifted slightly in his grip. He flipped back to the requisition form, referencing his own entries in the margin of the manifest and ran his finger slowly down the list and stopped.

Requisition:

* Requested: Freeze-Dried Coffee – 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)

Manifest:

* Received: \[ \_ \]

His eyes lingered on the blank space next to the entry—a blank space where confirmation should have been. He sprung for the received crates of goods, passing through everything with a refined efficiency. **No coffee.** Reeve pressed his thumb hard against the clipboard, staring at the empty space on the manifest. *No notation. No backorder. No explanation.*

The Keystone shipments were perfect for a long time, no missing items. Then, small inconsistencies were starting to become much more common. First small amounts of lab supplies were not there, then a few boxes of sterile gloves never showed up. Now, 20 kg of coffee seemingly just failed to exist.

He closed the shipment crate and straightened his posture and was no longer curling over in unfettered frustration. He glanced towards the entrance to the station's common area as though he could see through the reinforced walls to the coffee maker. He then shifted his gaze to the mug on his desk, a constant companion in his life. **Tomorrow, it would be empty.**

Reeve tightened his grip even further on his clipboard, his knuckles whitening before releasing slightly, a sense of focus and concern took over his face.

I know we've had some recent (in the last month or so) folks that are into and interested in cooking and baking (I just made its own dedicated post flair for it today as we didn't have one before, so, fear not, I came barreling in with one!) and I LOVE the idea as someone with like 2% the cooking and baking and adulting skills out in the world and someone that really, really, really needs to learn some new (or old) techniques and things moving forwards!! 

I'd be SO DOWN for making Youtube video content around ANY recipes you guys have, although the most beginner level would be the best for me to start with. I've done maybe one or two cooking/baking videos on my channel before but nothing super substantial and it's something I really have to grow and get out of my comfort zone in the near future, so, fuck it, why not start now?

I'm thinking I'll do some fancy editing with the videos, really show the ingredient/zoom in/name the amount or something as I've had folks ask for/encourage that before so that would be really fun! 

I'd get to do something new, something fresh and something probably funny in the process of also getting out some newer content. 

Let me know your thoughts or ideas in the comments or in other posts! 

And for starters:

*What are those basic kitchen essentials that you can think of that are a MUST HAVE?* 

Let me know down below!!! This will also probably be good info and tips for when I move out and I can gather some research into the subject and know what to unpack first haha 

I'm thinking: measuring cups, blender, Keurig/coffee maker, basic pots and pans, bowls, plates, utensils, salt/pepper (I'm not much of one for spices though!), maybe a spice or seasoning rack, spatulas, wooden or plastic spoons, a whisk, measuring cup... Any others that I missed? 

Also, any tips for measurements and mathing? I don't math these days and that shit confuses me. Or what about things that you think get left out when it comes to cooking? Or any mantras you can remember that helped you when you first started out that you'd like to share? 

I look forward to what cooking and baking adventures may exist in the future on this sub!! I live with prediabetes now so any sugar-free alternatives or low sugar content meals/dishes/limited bake goods would be fantastic. (I'm still new to that whole world too, so if there are some recipes that don't fit with a prediabetic life, still mention them anyways! It could still be useful and interesting to other folks!! 🙂)

For context, I (25) got a new cat a few weeks back and my sisters (17) and (16) were talking about wanting to come over to see her. I had to leave for the weekend and asked them to watch her Friday night-Sunday morning. 

I spent $100 on food (ice cream, fresh fruit, matcha & almond milk, pizza, fried rice, dumplings, cereal, yogurt, juice, soda, etc) to feed them through the weekend. I also sent them $10 each to get coffee/a pastry Saturday morning down the street from my apt. I also washed extra pajamas for my sisters and my fiance put our new tv up so they would have something to entertain them. **Mind you: our neighbor and my fiancé’s sister offered to watch the cat for free, but I wanted my sisters to have fun. 

Come Friday night, the older sister tells me that she wants her boyfriend to sleepover at the apartment, but there’s only one bed and I live in a studio so this didn’t make sense whatsoever??? My parents didn’t let her come over for throwing a huge fit and trying to prioritize the bf over our younger sister. My parents then just dropped off the younger sister at my apartment. I was pissed off that the older sister essentially ruined what I wanted to be a girls weekend for the two and tried to invite some random kid to sleep in my bed — my fiance was also pissed bc we didn’t agree to having a guy sleep at our place.  

The older of the two came the next day and I paid my sisters $50 and $30 after they left the following morning. The older one is blowing up my phone because I “didn’t send her enough money” and she “didn’t waste her gas for $30.” 

Am I the asshole for not paying them the same amounts?

I explained how they couldn’t be used together. I also said I was a little sad he got something I knew he really wanted and labeled it as a gift for me. I got him new fancy belts to wear for work, a gift only he can use. A box of chocolates would’ve been just fine.
I reminded him that we usually talk about these big apartment purchases together, so I wish it had just been a discussion instead of an apartment item labeled as ‘my’ gift. Also I mentioned how it doesn’t match my kitchen aesthetic at all (we agreed to decorate different rooms and mine is the kitchen).
He got a little upset and walked away, I did mention I am grateful that we have a Keurig. But that he could’ve spent less money (we have a little to spare but it’s cutting it pretty close especially with his job transition coming up!) and got me something for just me to feel special.
When he walked back in he told me he had just bought the right pods. Then I thought “Wow I can’t even choose what coffee I like. This is not a me gift it’s an us gift.” 
I want him to return it, if he wants one that bad he can put his $100 from returning it, plus I can put some money in and we can at LEAST get one that matches. Then it will be somewhat more for me. How do I even bring this up without sounding unreasonable?? Or am I really just overreacting?

No breakers in the main panel are tripped. The outlet powers three fishtanks, so light, heater, and two filters for each. Circuit also includes coffee pot, and every time it has tripped has been when coffee is brewing.

This message is from my father, my parents divorced when I was 6. I remember only DV from when they were together, the divorce was very messy he trashed our childhood home and left my mum with all responsibilities and basically dropped off the face of the earth. Reason for divorce was my mum found out about his affair and of course DV.
I didn't hear from him again until I was 10, he was in and out of our lives. My mum always encouraged us to have a relationship with him. He cleaned his life up, was re-married, had my little brother and things were cool for awhile before he started similar patterns with his new wife as he did with my mum. They also divorced for similar reasons as well as drug use. Again, he fell off the face of the earth and I did not see or hear from him again until 8th grade.
I kept in touch with my now ex-stepmother and he didn't like that, he said really nasty things about my mother, my stepmother and my brother and half brother. I decided to cut him out of my life for my own mental health and never spoke again until l was adult (20). Somehow he found my contact information and I honestly felt bad for him, when I met up with him for coffee it was very clear that he was a HEAVY drug user. He was black and / or missing teeth, had the walk of someone actively using etc. I kept our relationship superficial but felt very badly for him, he is my father after all

This superficial relationship didn't last long, he
""borrowed"" a lot of money from me, I knew I would never get it back. But it still bothers me that he knew I wouldn't say no. The last straw was when I was at his apartment, he smokes weed when he has it and I do as well - but I would never smoke his weed for obvious reasons lol. He pulled out a small glass pipe (crack pipe) and tried to tell me it was resin from a bong of weed and was very heavily trying to influence me to try it. I made up a reason to leave, a week later he called me and was so verbally abusive over the phone. He called me every name in the book, body shamed and was overall just a horrible human. We never spoke again.
Fast forward about 4 years, my boyfriend and l of 8 years are pregnant! (I don't believe in marriage because of my childhood before anyone comes for me for having such a long term boyfriend lol). It weighed heavily on my heart not to at least reach out to let him know, I wasn't going to continue a relationship other than an occasional update text. I reached out to him and he pretended not to know who l was. Literally said ""sorry I don't know any insert my name"" when I said yeah you do l'm your daughter he said his daughter was dead to him. I never even got the chance to tell him about my son.

My son is now 6 months old and I received an email from my father on my work email yesterday and a follow up this morning.

Email 1: are you okay????

Email 2: Just checking.. Just packing. Going to move. Been living at farm. Keep apartment for a place to get way from my buddies freinds. What ya up to.

1iqb6ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iqb6ts/is_efficiency_really_that_important/,Is efficiency really that important?,"Just a topic of discussion,

Tldr: While looking at setting up and customise my Vim profile, all I could read or hear is efficiency, particularly how efficient it is for your hands to never leave your keyboard. And it made me think, if it is that inefficient to never let your hands leave the keyboard then why have a cup of coffee with you, why take toilet breaks, why have a lunch. Surely being able to debug code quickly is better than having the ultimate setup so your hands never leave the keyboard. This seems to be something that has appeared over the past 5 years or so. Am I missing something?

Now a bit of context.

 I have very little experience in computer programming, and non in the industry, been trying to learn on and off for a few years, but everytime I get to the point where I want to start a project life seems to take over for a year and then am back to the beginning.

I am starting again with python, and using Vim these are my reasons for using vim.

While using Intellij for Java my laptop battery life was about 3 hours. With Vim it's 6 hours.

Vim is just a nicer place to be, it's uncluttered, no menu systems to navigate, and with a good colour scheme for syntax highlighting and a bit of transparency on your terminal window I can stay there for hours.

The fact I am using a laptop, actually on my lap on the sofa or I go into a quiet cafe to do it I don't really use a mouse, and although the pad is alright I always found them cumbersome so being able to navigate with keys and nothing else is nice.

I am looking at projects with headless pi's so being able to use a terminal editor is an advantage, so why not learn now.

But this emphasis on efficiency with your fingers constantly being on the keyboard almost feels like being on a production line, and in an industry like that surely being able to debug code fast is far more advantageous than having the ultimate setup?

#**As Reddit doesn't allow posts to exceed 40,000 characters, Ford's edition had to be split into three parts because his whole career cannot be ignored.**

#**My Darling Clementine (1946)**

His 89th film. It stars Henry Fonda, Victor Mature, Linda Darnell, Walter Brennan, Tim Holt, Cathy Downs and Ward Bond. It follows Wyatt Earp during the period leading up to the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. 

In 1931, Stuart Lake published the first biography two years after Earp's death. Lake retold the story in the 1946 book My Darling Clementine, for which Ford acquired the film rights. The two books have been determined to be largely fictionalized stories about the Earp brothers and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and their conflict with the outlaw Cowboys: Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury and his brother Frank McLaury. The gunfight was relatively unknown to the American public until Lake published the two books and after the movie was made.

Wanna know a crazy fun fact? You might think: well, what does Ford think he know about Wyatt Earp? Turns out a lot. What if I told you... that Ford actually met Wyatt Earp? Ford said that when he was a prop boy in the early days of silent pictures, Earp would visit pals he knew from his Tombstone days on the sets. He said, ""I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in *My Darling Clementine*, we did it exactly the way it had been."" Ford did not want to make the film, but his contract required him to make one more movie for 20th Century Fox.

The final script of the movie varies considerably from historical fact to create additional dramatic conflict and character. Clementine Carter is not a historical person, and in this script, she appears to be an amalgam of Big Nose Kate and Josephine Earp. The Earps were also never cowboys, drovers, or cattle owners. Important plot devices in the film and personal details about the main characters were all liberally adapted for the movie.

Even though Ford wasn't excited over making the film, the film was a box office hit and was hailed as one of the greatest Westerns ever made.

You might think the film is inaccurate, or that you didn't know certain aspects. But remember, you're seeing the version that Earp told Ford. The next time you watch it, take into account that you're watching a story told by The Legend to The Legend. That makes it more iconic than other biopics.

- **Budget:** $2,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $5,500,000. ($89.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $5,500,000.

#**The Fugitive (1947)**

His 90th film. Based on the novel *The Power and the Glory* by Graham Greene, it stars Henry Fonda, Dolores del Río, and Pedro Armendáriz. When Central America denounces Christianity, a runaway priest boards a ship sailing to America. But, the priest learns that a police informer is sailing on the ship and must outwit him for survival.

This was filmed on location in Taxco de Alarcón, Cholula, Cuernavaca, and the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. With the exception of two assistant directors and an editor, the entire crew was Mexican, about it Ford said it ran ""neck and neck with the best... in Hollywood."" Ford was helped by Mexican director Emilio Fernández, who served as an associate producer of the film. He introduced Ford to Dolores del Río, Pedro Armendáriz and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. About Figueroa's work, Ford said: ""It had a lot of damn good photography – with those black and white shadows, [...] We had a good cameraman, Gabriel Figueroa, and we'd wait for the light – instead of the way it is nowadays, where regardless of the light, you shoot.""

#**Fort Apache (1948)**

His 91st film. Based on the short story *Massacre* by James Warner Bellah, it stars John Wayne and Henry Fonda. Colonel Oswald Turner, who serves as the commanding officer at Fort Apache, clashes with Captain Kirby York, his deputy, as the former wants to become popular in the Arizona outpost.

The film received high praise and was a box office hit. The film was one of the first to present an authentic and sympathetic view of Native Americans. 

- **Budget:** $2,100,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,000,000. ($79.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $6,000,000.

#**3 Godfathers (1948)**

His 92nd film. Based on the 1913 novelette *The Three Godfathers* by Peter B. Kyne, it stars John Wayne, Pedro Armendáriz and Harry Carey Jr.. The story is a loose retelling of the biblical Wise Men in an American Western context, as it follows three outlaws on the run who risk their freedom and their lives to return a newborn to civilization, when they see the mother dying.

The film was a critical and commercial success.

- **Budget:** $1,243,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,078,000. ($27.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,841,000.

#**She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)**

His 93rd film. It stars John Wayne, Joanne Dru, John Agar, Ben Johnson, and Harry Carey Jr. Captain Nathan Brittles heads his last assignment before retirement to stop a Native American attack. But the job gets challenging when his superior instructs him to escort two women to safety.

Ford initially was uncertain whom to cast in the lead role. However, he knew that he did not want John Wayne for the part — considering, among other factors, that Wayne would be playing a character over twenty years older than he was at the time. Reportedly, Wayne's 1948 performance in *Red River* changed Ford's mind, causing him to exclaim, ""I didn't know the big son of a bitch could act!"" Ford realized Wayne had grown considerably as an actor, and was now capable of playing the character he envisaged for this film. When shooting was completed, Ford presented Wayne with a cake with the message, ""You're an actor now"". The role also became one of Wayne's favorite performances.

The film was another success for both Ford and Wayne.

- **Budget:** $1,600,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $5,400,000. ($72.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $5,400,000.

#**When Willie Comes Marching Home (1950)**

His 94th film. The film is based on the short story by Sy Gomberg, and stars Dan Dailey and Corinne Calvet. In the film, Willie Kluggs enters the service with hopes of going overseas, but his uncanny marksmanship keeps him at home as a shooting instructor.

It was a moderate success.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,750,000. ($23.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,750,000.

#**Wagon Master (1950)**

His 95th film. It stars Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Joanne Dru, and Ward Bond, and the story follows a Mormon pioneer wagon train across treacherous desert to the San Juan River in Utah.

The story idea emerged while Ford was directing *She Wore a Yellow Ribbon* on location in southern Utah. Patrick Ford, a screenwriter and Ford's son, learned the history of the Mormon Hole in the Rock expedition from some local Mormon horsemen. Ford developed a story loosely based on the historical expedition. It was unusual for Ford to base his films on the stories he wrote, and it had been nearly 20 years since he'd last done so. Ford commissioned Patrick Ford and Frank S. Nugent to write the screenplay. As was typical for Ford, he changed the screenplay significantly while directing the film; he was quoted as telling Patrick Ford and Nugent that, ""I liked your script, boys. In fact, I actually shot a few pages of it.""

The film was a box office failure, and while critics weren't enthusiastic, its reputation has grown with time.

#**Rio Grande (1950)**

His 96th film. It stars John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Ben Johnson, Claude Jarman Jr., Harry Carey Jr., Chill Wills, J. Carrol Naish, Victor McLaglen, Grant Withers, the Western singing group the Sons of the Pioneers and Stan Jones. In the summer of 1879, the second US cavalry regiment located at the Mexican border must control the attacks of the Apaches.

After completing *Wagon Master*, Ford did not want to make another Western. Instead, he wanted to film the Ireland-set romantic comedy-drama film *The Quiet Man* with Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, but Herbert Yates, the studio president of Republic Pictures, insisted that Ford first make *Rio Grande* with the same pairing of Wayne and O'Hara because he thought the script of *The Quiet Man* was weak and that the story was of little general interest. He also wanted it to offset the anticipated losses on that film.

As anticipated, it was a critical and commercial success.

- **Budget:** $1,214,899.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,500,000. ($59.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $4,500,000.

#**The Quiet Man (1952)**

His 97th film. Based on the short story by Maurice Walsh, it stars John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields and Ward Bond. Sean Thornton, a retired boxer, travels to his hometown in Ireland to reclaim his family farm. But once there, he falls in love with the fiery Mary, the sister of a local bully.

Ford read the story in 1933 and soon purchased the rights to it for $10. The story's author was paid another $2,500 when Republic bought the idea, and he received a final payment of $3,750 when the film was actually made. As mentioned, Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film with O'Hara and Wayne starring and Ford directing, but only if all three agreed to first film *Rio Grande*. They did, and after completing Rio Grande, they headed for Ireland to start shooting.

One of the conditions that Republic placed on Ford was that the film run under two hours. However, the finished picture was two hours and nine minutes. When screening the film for Republic executives, Ford stopped the film at approximately two hours in, on the verge of the climactic fistfight. Republic executives relented and allowed the film to run its full length.

The film was Ford's biggest success at the box office (even outperforming *Rio Grande*), and was hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It received 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Ford then made history by winning Best Director for the fourth time, a feat no director has achieved ever since.

- **Budget:** $1,750,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $7,600,000. ($91.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $7,600,000.

#**What Price Glory (1952)**

His 98th film. Based on the 1924 play by Maxwell Anderson and Laurence Stallings, it stars James Cagney, Corinne Calvet and Dan Dailey. War breaks out between marine Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt when they fall in love with Charmaine, the daughter of the local innkeeper. The two resume their old rivalry to win Charmaine's heart.

Despite mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,000,000. ($47.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $4,000,000.

#**The Sun Shines Bright (1953)**

His 99th film. Based on the short story by Irvin S. Cobb, it stars Charles Winninger and Arleen Whelan. In the film, William Pittman Priest has to use all his wiles to retain his position as judge in his Kentucky hometown, while continuing to be a voice for the town's underclass and for democratic values.

No box office numbers available, but Ford often cited this as his favorite among all his films.

#**Mogambo (1953)**

His 100th film! An achievement very few directors can get! A remake of Victor Fleming's 1932 film *Red Dust*, it stars Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, and Grace Kelly. In the film, Victor Marswell and Eloise Kelly fall in love with each other on a Kenyan safari. Things take a turn when another woman, Linda, is attracted towards Marswell.

The film was shot in Kenya in 1952, and the crew was given an armed guard due to the Mau Mau Uprising. The shoot was difficult. There was a rumor Clark Gable was going to be assassinated by the Mau Mau, so Ford moved a location. Two of the crew were revealed to be Mau Mau. The unit was plagued by rain and had a deleterious effect on the already poor quality of the roads. Three of the crew were killed in road accidents, including assistant director John Hancock.

The film was Ford's biggest box office hit, and earned positive reviews.

- **Budget:** $3,100,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,576,000. ($54.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $8,268,000.

#**The Long Gray Line (1955)**

His 101st film. Based on the autobiography *Bringing Up the Brass* by Marty Maher, it stars Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara. It follows Maher, a scrappy Irish immigrant whose 50-year career at West Point took him from a dishwasher to a non-commissioned officer and athletic instructor.

Another Ford hit.

- **Budget:** $1,748,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,100,000. ($48.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $4,100,000.

#**Mister Roberts (1955)**

His 102nd film. Based on the 1946 novel, it stars Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon. Robert is on a US Naval ship during World War 2 and is eager to fight for the country. The captain of the ship, though, is reluctant to sign his transfer.

The film earned over $20 million domestically, becoming Ford's highest grossing film. It earned positive reviews, and earned 3 Oscar noms (including Best Picture), with Lemmon winning Best Supporting Actor.

- **Budget:** $2,300,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,200,000. ($251.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $21,200,000.

#**The Searchers (1956)**

*""He had to find her...""*

His 103rd film. Based on the 1954 novel by Alan Le May, it stars John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and Natalie Wood. It is set during the Texas–Indian wars, and follows a middle-aged Civil War veteran who spends years looking for his abducted niece, accompanied by his adopted nephew.

Natalie Wood was still a student in high school when this film was being made, and, on several occasions, John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter had to pick her up at school. This caused a good deal of excitement among Wood's female classmates. This was the first major film to have a purpose-filmed making-of, requested by Ford. It deals with most aspects of making the film, including preparation of the site, construction of props, and filming techniques.

The film was a box office success, and it earned an enormous praise upon release. In subsequent years, it has been hailed as one of the greatest films ever made, becoming a staple of the Western genre.

- **Budget:** $3,750,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $9,600,000. ($112.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $9,600,000.

#**The Wings of Eagles (1957)**

His 104th film. It stars John Wayne, Dan Dailey and Maureen O'Hara, and is based on the life of Frank ""Spig"" Wead and the history of U.S. Naval aviation from its inception through World War II.

It was another box office success for both Ford and Wayne.

- **Budget:** $1,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,300,000. ($26.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $3,650,000.

#**The Rising of the Moon (1957)**

His 105th film. It stars Cyril Cusack, Noel Purcell, and Denis O'Dea, and follows three separate stories set in Ireland.

No box office numbers available.

#**The Last Hurrah (1958)**

His 106th film. Based on the 1956 novel by Edwin O'Connor, and stars Spencer Tracy as a veteran mayor preparing for yet another election campaign. 

The film earned positive reviews, but it was a box office failure.

- **Budget:** $2,300,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,200,000. ($24.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,200,000.

#**Gideon's Day (1958)**

His 107th film. Based on the 1955 novel by John Creasey, it stars Jack Hawkins, Dianne Foster and Cyril Cusack. In the film, London Inspector Gideon faces outrage and danger in his quest to bring the capital's criminals to justice. 

No box office numbers available.

#**The Horse Soldiers (1959)**

His 108th film. Based on hte 1956 novel by Harold Sinclair, it stars John Wayne, William Holden and Constance Towers. It is a fictionalized version of the famous Grierson's Raid by Federal cavalry in April–May 1863 riding southward through Mississippi and around the Mississippi River fortress of Vicksburg during the Vicksburg campaign to split the southern Confederacy by Union Army Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.

Holden and Wayne both received $750,000 for starring, a record salary at the time. The project was plagued from the start by cost overruns, discord, and tragedy. Holden and Ford argued incessantly. Wayne was preoccupied with pre-production logistics for *The Alamo*. Lukey's dialog was considered racist, to the point that Althea Gibson, the former Wimbledon and U.S. National tennis champion who was cast in the role, found offensive. She informed Ford that she would not deliver her lines as written. Though Ford was notorious for his intolerance of actors' demands, he agreed to modify the script.

During filming of the climactic battle scene, veteran stuntman Fred Kennedy suffered a broken neck while performing a horse fall and died. It was reported that ""Ford was completely devastated. [He] felt a deep responsibility for the lives of the men who served under him."" The film was scripted to end with the triumphant arrival of Marlowe's forces in Baton Rouge, but Ford ""simply lost interest"" after Kennedy's death. He ended the film with Marlowe's farewell to Hannah Hunter before crossing and blowing up the bridge.

Despite some big numbers, it was considered a box office failure, due largely to Wayne's and Holden's high salaries and the complex participation of multiple production companies.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $7,600,000. ($82.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $7,600,000.

#**Sergeant Rutledge (1960)**

His 109th film. It stars Jeffrey Hunter, Constance Towers, Woody Strode and Billie Burke. The film follows Sergeant Rutledge, a Black first sergeant in a colored regiment of the United States Cavalry, known as ""Buffalo Soldiers"". At a U.S. Army fort in the early 1880s, he is being tried by a court-martial for the rape and murder of a white girl as well as for the murder of the girl's father, who was the commanding officer of the fort. 

The film is notorious, as this is one of the few American films of the 1960s to have a Black man in a leading role and the first mainstream Western to do so.

#**Two Rode Together (1961)**

His 110th film. Based on the 1959 novel *Comanche Captives* by Will Cook, it stars James Stewart, Richard Widmark, and Shirley Jones. A corrupt sheriff and an army officer embark on a rescue mission. However, complications arise when cultures collide, making it difficult for the prisoners to reintegrate into their former lives.

Ford agreed to direct the film for money ($225,000 plus 25% of the net profits) and as a favor to Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn, who died in 1958. The director hated the material, believing he had done a far better treatment of the theme in *The Searchers*. Even after he brought in his most trusted screenwriter, Frank Nugent — the man responsible for *The Searchers* and nine other Ford classics — to fix the script, the director said it was ""the worst piece of crap I’ve done in 20 years.""

This was a critical and commercial failure.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,600,000. ($16.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,600,000.

#**The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)**

His 111th film. Based on the 1953 short story by Dorothy M. Johnson, it stars John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Woody Strode, Strother Martin, and Lee Van Cleef. In the film, Senator Ransom Stoddard returns to his home town where he recounts his past to a local reporter. He recalls the time he was a lawyer and how he is known for killing a local goon, Liberty Valance.

Despite having made most of his prior films in color, this film was shot in black-and-white on Paramount's soundstages. Many stories and speculations exist to explain this decision. Ford preferred that medium over color: ""In black and white, you've got to be very careful. You've got to know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is. You might say I'm old fashioned, but black and white is real photography."" Ford also reportedly argued that the climactic shoot-out between Valance and Stoddard would not have worked in color.

Stewart related that midway through filming, Wayne asked him why he, Stewart, never seemed to be the target of Ford's venomous remarks. Other cast and crew members also noticed Stewart's apparent immunity from Ford's abuse. Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strode's costume for the film's beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, ""It looks a bit Uncle Remussy to me."" Ford responded, ""What's wrong with Uncle Remus?"" and proceeded to humilliate Stewart in front of the whole crew. Stewart said he ""wanted to crawl into a mouse hole"", but Wayne told him, ""Well, welcome to the club. I'm glad you made it.""

After a string of misfires, the film was a box office hit for Ford. It received universal acclaim, widely considered as one of the greatest Westerns ever made.

- **Budget:** $3,200,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $8,000,000. ($84.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $8,000,000.

#**How the West Was Won (1962)**

His 112th film, co-directed with Henry Hathaway and George Marshall. It stars Carroll Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Carolyn Jones, Karl Malden, Gregory Peck, George Peppard, Robert Preston, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, Eli Wallach, John Wayne and Richard Widmark, with Spencer Tracy narrating. The film centers on a family and their descendents over the span of decades as they explore and settle the American frontier of the United States.

After the colossal success of *Ben-Hur*, MGM was excited to develop more spectacle films. In 1960, MGM struck a deal to produce four films in the Cinerama process, and Bing Crosby approached the studio with a proposition. He was developing a television spectacular called *How the West Was Won* based on photographs of the Old West in Life, with profits earmarked for St. John's Hospital, along with an album inspired by the same article recorded with Rosemary Clooney. MGM purchased the film rights from Crosby.

MGM retooled the concept. The plan was to film a story of six segments featuring 12 stars, with a cohesive overall storyline. Among the historical figures to be featured were Buffalo Bill, the James brothers and Billy the Kid. Ultimately, the film contained five sections: the 1830s westward migration, the 1849 California gold rush, the Civil War, the construction of the transcontinental railroad, and the ""taming"" of the Wild West, with one family's story over three generations providing the bridge between each time period. Ford directed the Civil War segment, George Marshall the railroad segment and Henry Hathaway the rest.

The film's ambition paid off. It earned over $50 million worldwide, becoming one of the most popular films of the 60s. The film was hailed as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.

- **Budget:** $14,483,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $46,500,000. ($489.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $50,000,000.

#**Donovan's Reef (1963)**

His 113th film. It stars John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Elizabeth Allen, Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, Dick Foran, and Dorothy Lamour. On a beautiful island where people of different races and backgrounds live together in harmony, a war veteran tries to salvage his friend's reputation for the sake of his arriving daughter.

It received mixed reviews, although it was still a moderate success. And so, after so many decades working together, this was the final collaboration between Ford and Wayne.

- **Budget:** $2,686,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,600,000. ($68.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $6,600,000.

#**Cheyenne Autumn (1964)**

His 114th film. It stars Richard Widmark, Carroll Baker, James Stewart, and Edward G. Robinson. It tells the story of a factual event, the Northern Cheyenne Exodus of 1878–79, told with artistic license. 

The film received mixed reviews, and failed to break even. After carrying the title of ""Father of the Western"", Ford was ready to call it quits. This was his final Western, and Ford proclaimed it an elegy for the Native Americans who had been abused by the U.S. government and misrepresented in numerous of his own films.

- **Budget:** $4,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $7,000,000. ($71.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $7,000,000.

#**7 Women (1967)**

His 115th and final film. Based on the short story *Chinese Finale* by Norah Lofts, it stars Anne Bancroft, Sue Lyon, Margaret Leighton, Flora Robson, Mildred Dunnock, Betty Field, Anna Lee, Eddie Albert, Mike Mazurki and Woody Strode. This film follows a missionary, Agatha Andrews, who strives to fight a bandit's attack, with the help of six other women from her group.

The film received a positive response, but it was a box office failure. And just like that, Ford's career ended after 53 years of working in the industry. He would continue with documentaries and other works, but this was final feature-length film.

- **Budget:** $2,300,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,100,000. ($10.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,100,000.

#**The End**

Ford had another film, *The Miracle of Merriford*, set up, but MGM cancelled the project one week before filming began. His last work was a documentary, *Chesty: A Tribute to a Legend*, made in 1970 but released in 1976. John Wayne said that Ford wanted to continue making films until his death, ""Up until the very last years of his life... Pappy could have directed another picture, and a damned good one. But they said Pappy was too old. Hell, he was never too old. In Hollywood these days, they don't stand behind a fella. They'd rather make a goddamned legend out of him and be done with him.""

Ford's health deteriorated rapidly in the early 1970s; he suffered a broken hip in 1970 which put him in a wheelchair. He had to move from his Bel Air home to a single-level house in Palm Desert, California, near Eisenhower Medical Center, where he was being treated for stomach cancer. He died on August 31, 1973, at the age of 79.

#**The Verdict**

Even with the later misfires in his career, it's hard to describe Ford as anything but insanely reliable.

For 53 years, Ford kept himself busy, directing so many films in a single year. To say that he killed it doesn't make it justice. He is the epitome of an era. He might not have created the Western, but it's tough to imagine someone else as the face of the genre (Sergio Leone might be the only other candidate). His non-Westerns were also epic. While *How Green Was My Valley* may earn polarizing reactions for beating *Citizen Kane*, it's still a fantastic film. It's likely those who hate it haven't even watched it.

Despite some aspects not aging well, Ford's films are the definition of movie magic. You can't imagine how Hollywood would be nowadays without them. Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Ingmar Bergman have named him as a big influence in their works. Spielberg is also a known fan of him, and his career has been influenced by Ford (you might want to check out that final scene of *The Fabelmans*). He also holds the distinction for most Oscars for Best Director at 4, with Frank Capra and William Wyler as the runner-ups with 3. And 11 of his films have been preserved at the National Film Registry, more than any other director (George Cukor, Howard Hawks and William Wyler are runner-ups with 10). A Legend in every sense of the world.

Just consider it. A life with 115 films, 6 Oscars, revitalizing the Western, serving your country in World War II (including being present in Midway and D-Day), and even meeting the Legend Wyatt Earp. It's a wonderful life.

No one can be called a cinema fan until watching John Ford's films.

They are *not* dropping to the bottom, probably because of their density and are just floating on top. Any recommendations on how to filter them out? 

I know a coffee filter is a no-go, I actually did bottle one with a coffee filter because I needed one bottled fast for Valentine's day and it was what was available to me. It tasted fine to me and my gf, but I don't want to do the rest with a coffee filter. Would a cheesecloth work or does this create the same problem? 

In my previous bottling, I actually ended up attaching the coffee filter to the end of the siphon and creating a little balloon with room to catch flower petals. The bottle neck is too thin to shove a coffee filter or anything of that sort in and create a place for filtering, and I thought this would reduce the risk of oxidation.

I am *not* trying to filter out any lees or yeast!! (But I'm probably gonna trigger the bot)

1iqayis,https://i.redd.it/4837otrv7dje1.jpeg,AIO - backstory needed to understand,"Ok so, I’m going to make a VERY long story as short as possible lol. 

This message is from my father, my parents divorced when I was 6. I remember only DV from when they were together, the divorce was very messy he trashed our childhood home and left my mum with all responsibilities and basically dropped off the face of the earth. Reason for divorce was my mum found out about his affair and of course DV. 

I didn’t hear from him again until I was 10, he was in and out of our lives. My mum always encouraged us to have a relationship with him. He cleaned his life up, was re-married, had my little brother and things were cool for awhile before he started similar patterns with his new wife as he did with my mum. They also divorced for similar reasons as well as drug use. Again, he fell off the face of the earth and I did not see or hear from him again until 8th grade. 

I kept in touch with my now ex-stepmother and he didn’t like that, he said really nasty things about my mother, my stepmother and my brother and half brother. I decided to cut him out of my life for my own mental health and never spoke again until I was adult (20). Somehow he found my contact information and I honestly felt bad for him, when I met up with him for coffee it was very clear that he was a HEAVY drug user. He was black and / or missing teeth, had the walk of someone actively using etc. I kept our relationship superficial but felt very badly for him, he is my father after all 🤷🏼‍♀️.

This superficial relationship didn’t last long, he “borrowed” a lot of money from me, I knew I would never get it back. But it still bothers me that he knew I wouldn’t say no. The last straw was when I was at his apartment, he smokes weed when he has it and I do as well - but I would never smoke his weed for obvious reasons lol. He pulled out a small glass pipe (crack pipe) and tried to tell me it was resin from a bong of weed and was very heavily trying to influence me to try it. I made up a reason to leave, a week later he called me and was so verbally abusive over the phone. He called me every name in the book, body shamed and was overall just a horrible human. We never spoke again. 

Fast forward about 4 years, my boyfriend and I of 8 years are pregnant! (I don’t believe in marriage because of my childhood before anyone comes for me for having such a long term boyfriend lol). It weighed heavily on my heart not to at least reach out to let him know, I wasn’t going to continue a relationship other than an occasional update text. I reached out to him and he pretended not to know who I was. Literally said “sorry I don’t know any *insert my name*” when I said yeah you do I’m your daughter he said his daughter was dead to him. I never even got the chance to tell him about my son.

My son is now 6 months old and I received an email from my father on my work email yesterday and a follow up this morning. He must have found it via my LinkedIn page, as it’s public for work.

I just found out about attachment style theory

let me tell you the brief of my story.


-what happened to our relationship is really follow the cycle of DA when relationship stale. 

-she re connected with her phantom ex (puppy love as a women) 

-she stop relationship by a reason of she want to be independent , said she want to invest in her self enjoy the concept of solitude . Being alone is the best for now.
She said don’t believe that traditional relationship will works. 

-we been together seeing each other almost everyday for 9 years 
She said that our connection started to loosing bit by bit on the last 3 years (fhe time after  we get married) 
We never seem to have the sense of her DA  behavior we live together happily without worry . Until there was an issue about her suffering at her workplace that liberate something about finding her self thinking about what she want who she is etc… 




-we broke up for 1 month already. Still staying in the same house . We made an agreement to be a good cat parents🐱 , being good friend who support each other . (She not stay home everyday there will be 2-3 days that she stay at her own apartment) 



- my attachment style when I did the test is Fearful Avoidant but I think I’m more on the Anxious side . 

- first 3 weeks I can’t put my feet on the ground. I keep wanting to see her and spend my time mostly align with her stay home schedule. We even went to eat , coffee and go aboard trip together (pre book before break up) 

Now I started to move on , with a healthier mind . I can still sense love between us . She’s don’t realized that what she did is 95% match with the theory about DA. 

I am trying to do NO CONTACT 
Since she still come to my house 
What is the good balanced to no contact?

I strongly believe that telling her not to come to the house may made things worse. Eventhough she said if I need any support like tell her not to come she’ll understand. 

*Her close friend told her that if she keep coming staying will hurt me more. she told all her friends that she just come here for the cats . And mentioned that I said I’m ok for her to come

Feel free to share your advices or experiences 🙏🏽

I want us to get back together if she still love us and just lost her way.

1iqat7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/soulslikes/comments/1iqat7i/becoming_a_dad_seems_to_have_permanently_killed/,Becoming a dad seems to have permanently killed my ability to enjoy super bosses in soulslikes,"Just before I had kids, I was worried the parenting experience would make playing difficult and attention-demanding games like soulslikes a thing of the past. These have been some of my favorite titles historically, so while obviously for me the tradeoff was worth it, I would be sad to see the games go.

I’ve been pleasantly surprised, with the kids now approaching 3 and 5, that you can totally still play and enjoy this genre. Yes, you might need to take a break for the first 6 months, and the frequent lack of a pause button can be frustrating, but at least for me, I’ve been able to find the time to squeeze in gaming. If anything, the fewer hours I play now are even more satisfying than the longer hours I used to.

But there’s one big exception: super bosses. You know, the capstone, DLC or secret area, ultra difficult challenge bosses that test everything you’ve learned.

Some of my favorite memories include learning, struggling against, and eventually defeating bosses like Manus, Orphan, Midir, Isshin, etc.

But what I realized is, I much prefer to play these bosses when I have several hours in front of me, when I’m alert and ready to lock in, so to speak. These days, my 1-2 gaming hours tend to come around 10 pm, after the kids are down, the chores are done, and so on.

I’ve had too many nights now with recent super bosses where I stayed up too late not really making progress, got myself wired up then slept poorly, all while watching the precious minutes of discretionary time tick away.

I miss the experience of a lazy Saturday or Sunday where I pour a cup of coffee, get in the zone, and emerge around lunchtime with a victory. Now I’m either skipping super bosses altogether or purposely over-leveling, copying a meta build etc etc. (nothing inherently wrong with these things, but it’s just not the same experience)

Anyone else have a similar experience? To be clear, this is ultimately not a big problem. Obviously the kids and everything else about my life is more important. It’s just a little thing I miss. ",5,1739652055.0,soulslikes,18,0.69,False

I was in a horrible head-space and had been for a while, I was neglecting our relationship and focusing on my own selfish goals and ambitions. Unfortunately in reflection I realized what was really important to me was not my desires, but it was actually her love and acceptance of me even through all my BS. I have found myself in a clearer frame of mind recently and figured out alot of my mishaps. Im not in love with the idea of her, im in love with her. Ive never been so determined about anything in my life and have never really felt this way about anyone before. All of this unfortunately has probably come too late. I did immediately regret my decision to break up, but for the wrong reasons and didnt go about trying to mend things correctly, for the first month I didnt give her enough space and was over bearing and desperate. We didnt talk much after that, however I did receive a few messages from her and a merry Christmas, of which I didn’t respond. Last week I reached out just to say hey I hope youre doing well, it was a good conversation over text, quick replies and not dry conversation. I ended with it was nice to hear from you and talk soon, which she replied the same. Today, after I week I texted her about a friend interested about where she works. Followed by some more small talk and I capped it off with asking if she would want to grab coffee or drinks just to catch up some time. She replied “Maybe. I have been really busy lately but maybe someday after work. “ Which I said would be perfect and just let me know. She said will do, have a good day and told me what she was up to for the rest of the day.


My question is, she definitely is looking for change and improvement in me, but im not sure if she will be able to look past what happened or slowly come around. That kills me because I know what she really means to me and what Im capable of. Do you think the “maybe” is genuine or a probable no? 

Im over analyzing everything, chasing breadcrumbs but like most heartbroken people, this all I care about. Probably not the best outlook but hey, I really do miss her and wants whats best, even if thats not me.

I personally believe this since my eyes are unfortunately dark brown, dull, boring, dead, empty, soulless, terribly common overall, and I have to work double to make myself look present and stand some attention. I feel terribly inadequate and plain because I got the same shade for eyes and hair (dark brown) and makes me feel sad and upset a lot of times that that's the color I dislike most and still cannot change it (I have tried dyed for hair but it is exhausting and contact colored lenses I haven't but I have dry eyes and I feel cautious about that) I wish I had pretty beautiful eyes like I see in some models or even average people with those greenish enigmatic emerald eyes, or piercing cool blue ones or icy impressive grey, sweet gold honey, calming and bright combined hazel or stunning yellowish amber or even an evident light brown but not I got instead the most uninteresting shade (dark brown) the shade with not mix, no blend, no life enough to make it appear slightly lighter even during the day which it's hard to do so. My skin is pale and I kinda like it but it it's not enough which my hair and eyes doesn't stand any contrast like dark hair and light eyes or light hair and dark eyes and that makes me feel so plain and I do think again that's easy to forget somebody with such dark features than another with the breaking halo of light eyes since they have a point that could draw attention easily and faster than somebody brunette (hair and eyes) You have to work harder to be noticed at first glance with such darkness (eyes and hair) and make yourself look attractive objectively. The beauty standards teaches us that light eyes are cooler, even in cold countries like Scandinavia that I read a ton of times that it is exotic but perhaps for 5 minutes since they still know blond or red hair and light eyes stand out most and dominate/rule the global beauty scale. I personally would love to trade somebody that's eyes shade is lighter than dark brown in a hearbit 😔 So, personally that's how I do feel about myself also. My eye shape is almond and I have read people call dark brown as mocha, black coffee, root beer, warm eyes etc (I hate those terms) and I still do prefer colder lighter eyes than those because people takes advantage of you because they might assume you are easily to fool because you look more ""approachable"" and ""kinder"" and ironically that hasn't help me so far. I wish I would look colder and even a bit more intimidating if that brings me the halo that a pair of gorgeous light eyes naturally have. I really dislike my dark combo features. I'm latin and more times than I can recognize that makes me feel inferior. I don't understand why somebody would choose to trade their light eyes for a really dark ones like mine for example, they have not sparkle and not shine at all (unless I'm burning purposely my retina under the sun for 10 seconds) my skin is light and pale with some warmth and even though my hair and eyes dark features puts me in such disadvantage in comparison to others with the opposite trait.

I passed by Manhattan after and Esther explained that they are developing ""EU"" profiles for the same beans that are lighter than the American equivalent. I also gotta say, Manhattan's Jose Giraldo triple fermentation natural was one of the highlights of the show for me. Super juicy but still bright and complex with an incredible clean presentation. 

Glitch was also next to onyx in the sibarist stand and they were super friendly and had great offerings. Bit too expensive for me, but I understand that they were coming all the way from Japan so I was just glad I got to try them out. Speaking of sibarist, I got to try their new flat 2 filter which are AMAZING. Super expensive and not for using on the daily, but definitely worth it for the occasional cup.

Some other highlights were this dak banana split I got for my gf and the maragesha from kaffelix, super complex and unique and Felix was super nice. A new roaster I discovered was Lyv from Málaga who had some crazy offerings, I particularly enjoyed their blue moon caturra which had an awesome bubble gum note. I got the hola ombligon as a gift from a friend and I'm looking forward to comparing it to the onyx one.

I also got to meet a few producers, the most notable of which was Sebastian Ramirez. I asked him what was on the tables this year and he said he is focusing on easy drinking, every day coffees that are still elegant along the lines of the white honey geisha (my fav coffee of 2024). I also asked about the red fruits decaf and he said that unfortunately it's been difficult to get a spot in the decaf plant but they are definitely looking in to getting more out there.",15,1739651888.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1iqaq9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iqaq9f/the_man_who_could_smell_thoughts/,The Man Who Could Smell Thoughts,"# 1. Perception into Poetry

For most, synesthesia was a gift. A strange, neurological quirk that turned perception into poetry.

But for him, it was a **curse**.

Because **he could smell thoughts.**

Not in a figurative way. Not in a way that could be explained through mere science or metaphor. **Thoughts had scents—real, overwhelming, inescapable scents.**

At first, it was fascinating. **The human mind, translated into odor.**

* **Love** smelled like honey warmed by the sun—thick, golden, and slow, clinging to everything it touched.
* **Guilt** was the metallic tang of pennies in the mouth, rust and regret bleeding together.
* **Ambition** carried the sterile, electric scent of cold steel, clean but sharp, the kind of smell that warned you of coming blood.
* **Lust** was overripe fruit, sickly sweet, teetering on the edge of rot.
* **Fear** was old sweat and damp wood, the scent of something buried alive.
* **Betrayal** was the scent of burnt sugar—pleasant at first, until it thickened in the lungs, charred and suffocating.
* **Sadness** was the faint, hollow smell of an empty room long after the flowers had died.

But **hypocrisy?**

**Hypocrisy was unbearable.**

It was not a single scent but **a war of contradictions.**

* The **stench of rotting flesh masked by perfume**—something decayed, forced to wear beauty like a disguise.
* **Sour milk just before it curdles in your throat**—a moment away from making you sick.
* The **rancid oil slick of decay smothered beneath layers of artificial freshness**—deception layered so thick, it became its own kind of reality.

It was the **worst of all human traits**.

It was, **perhaps, the greatest one.**

Because **no one** was free of it.



# 2. The Ideal Life is a Lie

Jonas Reeve had spent years **pretending** that he could live among people without suffocating.

He had built an **ideal life**—on paper, at least. A steady job. A decent apartment. A few friends, **enough to seem normal.**

But reality was **a festering thing**.

* His boss, preaching about **honesty and integrity**, stank of **spilled ink and expired meat—the rot of a man who made a fortune cutting corners.**
* His neighbor, always polite, offering him homemade cookies, reeked of **mothballs and mildew**—the smell of **a woman who hated herself for growing old and envied the youth of those around her.**
* Even his own mother, telling him she was proud, **smelled of dust and something acrid, a hidden resentment buried so deep she probably didn’t even know it was there.**

Jonas had always believed **he could be different.** That **he could be honest.** That **he could live without contradiction.**

But no one could.

Not even him.



# 3. The Stench of the Self

One night, standing in front of the mirror, Jonas did something he had been avoiding for years.

**He smelled himself.**

He took a deep breath.

And **almost vomited.**

* The scent of **self-righteousness**, bitter and chalky, like crushed aspirin.
* The **faint sweetness of excuses**, the kind that **evaporates too quickly, leaving only guilt behind.**
* The **stale, moldy aroma of someone who believed himself better than others—yet had done nothing to prove it.**

For years, he had convinced himself that **he was different.** That he saw the truth, that he lived honestly, that he was a man **untainted** by the world's deceptions.

But he wasn’t.

He was just as hypocritical as them.

**Maybe more.**

Because at least the others **didn’t know.** At least they could lie to themselves and believe it.

**But Jonas knew.**

**And still, he pretended.**



# 4. The Collapse of Reality

The realization shattered something inside him.

Once you know something, **you cannot un-know it.**

* Every conversation became a **suffocating tide of deception.**
* Every handshake left **a scent of false goodwill.**
* Every ""How are you?"" dripped with **the bitter musk of forced politeness.**

It **became too much.**

He stopped going outside. Stopped answering calls.Stopped speaking altogether.

But isolation only made it worse.

Without distractions, **the smells got stronger.**

He could smell **his own regrets** festering in the walls.His broken promises **seeped into the floorboards.**His **unspoken fears** thickened in the air like humidity before a storm.

He scrubbed his skin raw, trying to rid himself of the stink. He **cleaned, bleached, burned things that didn’t need burning.**

It didn’t help.

Because **the scent wasn’t on him.**

**It was inside him.**



# 5. The Final Realization

The last time anyone saw Jonas Reeve, he was sitting alone in a café, staring blankly ahead, his hands trembling around a cup of untouched coffee.

That was when he understood the final, most **terrible** truth.

**What if the world isn’t hypocritical?**

**What if hypocrisy is just… life?**

What if no one is lying?What if everyone is just **doing what they have to, to survive?**

What if honesty and deception are **not opposites**—but **partners**, intertwined like breath and lungs, each meaningless without the other?

What if **this sickness, this contradiction, this unbearable stench of human nature—was not a flaw, but the very thing that kept the world turning?**

Jonas exhaled.

And the coffee in his hands **suddenly smelled like ashes.**

Like something burned away.

Like the last hope of a man **who had finally accepted the horror of the world.**



# 6.The Scent of Clarity

They found Jonas two days later.

Not dead.

Just **empty.**

His apartment **untouched**, his belongings neatly in place, nothing to suggest anything had gone wrong—except for one detail.

**The entire place reeked.**

Not just his apartment.

The **hallway.** The **stairwell.** The **air around him.**

A smell so thick, **neighbors gagged as they walked past his door.**

They described it in different ways—**rotting flowers, decayed fruit, a landfill on a summer day.**

But Jonas, sitting in his chair, his hands resting in his lap, **knew exactly what it was.**

**It was the smell of understanding.**

And it was unbearable.

The coffee in his hands had long gone cold, but he didn’t care. **Because he could smell it now.**

Not just lies.Not just people.**Everything.**

And it was… *beautiful.*

A slow, sharp smile stretched across his face.

This wasn’t despair.This wasn’t surrender.

This was **clarity.**

For the first time in his life, Jonas wasn’t drowning in the weight of hypocrisy.

He was **above it.**

The world wasn’t sick. **It was working exactly as intended.**

Truth wasn’t better than lies.Lies weren’t worse than truth.

They were **one and the same.**

**This whole time, he had been suffering for nothing.**

Because he had been trying to **play by the wrong rules.**



# 7. The Egoist Awakens

A strange calm settled over him.

For years, Jonas had believed he was cursed—**that he was different.** That the world was broken, that people were disgusting, that he was **some tragic anomaly, forced to perceive what no one else could.**

But now, he saw the truth.

He wasn’t the anomaly. **They were.**

They were **fumbling in the dark, lying to themselves, drowning in contradictions they refused to acknowledge.**

Jonas? **He was free now.**

And *they*—the world, the people around him, the ones who didn’t understand—**they were beneath him.**

The thought slithered into his mind, wrapping itself around his ribs like a second spine.

He didn’t flinch at the realization.Didn’t reject it.

Instead, he **breathed it in.**

And for the first time in his life—

**it didn’t smell bad at all.**



# 8. The Change

His body felt lighter.

Not in the sense that a burden had been lifted—no, the weight was still there.

But now, he carried it differently.

Not as a victim.Not as a man drowning in disgust.

But as **something else entirely.**

Jonas Reeve **had spent years suffering.**

**Now?**

He was done suffering.

Now, he would **see how far this new understanding could take him.**



# 9. The Predator Walks

Jonas stood, stretching his limbs like an animal waking from hibernation.

The world smelled **different now.**

The stench of lies? The filth of human contradiction?

It didn’t repulse him anymore.

It was **his playground.**

He stepped out onto the street, breathing deeply, letting it all **wash over him.**

The man outside the café, telling a friend he was “doing great” while reeking of failure and debt?

Jonas smirked. **Weak.**

The woman on the phone, promising to call back when she never would?

Jonas chuckled. **Transparent.**

The businessman in a suit, smiling, shaking hands, masking his stench of corruption with expensive cologne?

Jonas smiled.

**Perfect.**



# 10. The Lion Has Tasted Blood

For years, Jonas thought hypocrisy was **the great sickness of mankind.**

But no.

It was **the great currency.**

And now, **he knew how to spend it.**



# Epilogue: The Final Stench

Jonas was not broken anymore.

Jonas was **not suffering anymore.**

He had **crossed the threshold.**

He had seen **the deepest, ugliest parts of human nature—**

And he was **finally okay with it.**

Because now, **he knew how to use it.**

And the world—**so full of lies, so full of weakness, so full of people pretending they understood their own lives**—

**The world had no idea what it had just unleashed.**

Jonas Reeve had spent his whole life **drowning in the truth.**

Now?

**He would make it work for him.**

And as he walked down the street, blending into the crowd, breathing in the **symphony of deception,**

**Jonas smiled.**

**Because now, he smelled exactly like them.**

Here's my loooong experience, because I loved reading everyone else's when I was researching and getting ready for my surgery. I'm keeping it as short as possible, even though there's a lot.

TLDR; it went really well, minimal pain, and I had a lot of help from people I love. A complication with shortness of breath and a cold sucked.

**CONSULT**

I started trying to schedule consults right after the election. I'd wanted to for years, but I was finally ready and my insurance (BCBS Federal Employee Program - Basic) finally added Bisalp to their list of covered procedures in 2025, so it will be less likely I'll have to fight them over it. Every doctor in my area from the child-free list had a massive wait time. Also, some were really kind of weird.

**TIP:** If you're scheduling multiple appointments like I was (out of fear of being denied by one) don't tell them you're shopping around for surgeons. You'd think it's common to get a second opinion, or find someone you're comfortable with, but two offices turned me down because of that. Red flag, anyway.

I made appointments with two doctors from the list out in January. Then, I was scrolling my local Reddit and, buried in a comments section of a post about OBGYNs, someone said a doctor sterilized them at 23. I immediately called her office and got a consult scheduled for later in November.

My appointment with her was literally fifteen minutes long, and it was actually all me asking questions, because as soon as I said what I wanted, she just said okay. I asked her so much that she decided I didn't need a pre-op to go over everything. Yippee! I'll probably be making her my normal gyn, because she was the most educated and candid doctor I've ever met. I'll be asking at my post-op if she's comfortable being on the list, but if anyone in Montana is in need of someone like her, you can DM me!

**BEFORE SURGERY**

In the week leading up, we just did as many chores as we could and made sure the house was clean. My partner would be able to do all our normal chores, but he's also in school and working, so I didn't want to be asking him to deep clean or anything when I wasn't able to help. I ran out of time to prep meals or grocery shop, but a good friend of ours offered to make me a couple soups!

I got a call from a nurse to go over basic pre-op questions since I didn't have an appointment. She did mention I needed to change my piercings to plastic, but that if I really couldn't, they'd tape over them. I ordered a cheap pack from Amazon and just did it.

**TIP:** It's a good idea to ask here if they prefer you to completely remove nose piercings for the surgery. My anesthesiologist requested all of them be removed, so we spent a long time at the hospital trying to force the little plastic jewelry out. It's surprisingly sturdy. I also had to completely remove my belly piercing because my surgeon goes in the belly button instead of under or above.

A few days before surgery, the hospital had me do an online check-in and it claimed I would owe $3,440 dollars up front and $7,000 something later. I've never dealt with insurance before (still on my parent's plan) so I panicked and called the hospital. I hadn't thought to ask about billing before, because I was kind of naive--my plan said it was covered, and the OBGYN's office said they called and my insurance was cool with it. The hospital basically said to just wait for my insurance EOB and not paid anything. I also called my insurance, verified the hospital and provider was in-network, had her check a bunch of codes, then had her email me a call summary, her name, and the call reference number.

Also, my parents drove two hours (through the snow!) to be with me. It was super sweet of them, so we got yummy pho for dinner. Then I went home, showered (and shaved, because I knew I wouldn't want to for a while), and went to bed early. I had been anxious leading up to it, but after dinner, it's like all the worry just went away. I was totally chill from this point all the way through surgery

**SURGERY DAY**

I had to be at the hospital by 7 am for check-in. I was told to not take my morning meds, but I got great sleep that night because they let me take my sleep aid. My cut-off time for eating was midnight, and I can't remember my cut-off for clear fluids. I usually don't eat or drink water when I first wake up anyway, so no biggie. I laid out my comfy clothes for when I got home and took a shower. They didn't give me fancy soap, and told me I didn't need to use antibacterial, so I just used regular unscented soap and skipped all lotion, perfume, etc.

We met my parents at the hospital and sat for like ten minutes before I was taken back for check in. The lady asked if I wanted to ""take advantage of their 20% discount for paying up front,"" but didn't give me grief when I said I would wait for insurance. Then I went back with the nurse. She had me change into a gown (70's bowling alley vibe pattern) and grippy socks (that I got to keep!), asked me some questions, and got my hand IV in, which didn't hurt at all. She was a really funny older lady and really knew what she was doing.

We had about an hour till my surgery. They only let one person back at a time, so my partner and parents played ping-pong to see me. Then my surgeon came in, talked to me, said just once that it was permanent and yada-yada, I signed some stuff, and that was that. Same with the anesthesiologist. My surgeon's nurse came by, had me use the restroom one more time, then they gave me the good old vein champagne and wheeled me off.

Honestly, I don't feel like the vein champagne really did much. I didn't feel any different, and remembered getting up on the table, talking with everyone, and looking around. The anesthesiologist told me to breathe through the oxygen mask, and I told him, ""This is the trick, I remember it from the last surgery I had."" And he said, ""No, this is the trick."" And then, whatever he did, I was out.

I tend to handle anesthesia really well. I woke up and was completely fine. Only my anesthesiologist was there, and I just asked him if she got both the tubes out, and he said yes. We joked around a bit, I told him I was in no pain and requested no more meds (it was literally a 0-1 on the pain scale), and I went back to the original room for recovery. They let one person at a time back to see me. They didn't give me any food, but I did have a ton of water. As soon as I was able to pee, they let me get dressed and head home! I brought a tiny pillow for the car ride home, between my belly and the seat belt, and it helped a lot.

At home I was still completely fine. My partner went to work for a few hours while my parents stayed with me. I realized I forgot to get stuff from CVS before hand, so my dad grabbed all the goodies when he went to get the pain meds and laxative the surgeon prescribed. I literally just laid in bed, scrolled on my phone, read, and napped all day. Mom prepped a soup with some ingredients I already had. I was able to get up every hour to two to take short walks, but our apartment is tiiiiiny, like a glorified studio, so it got boring fast.

I was also RAVENOUS literally right away, which surprised me. My dad got me McDonalds for lunch, Mom ordered me more pho for dinner, and I just couldn't stop eating. This went on for a couple days, then my hunger levels returned to normal.

I ended up with one incision in my belly button and two on my left side, one by my hip and one between my hip and ribs. No steri-strips, and I wasn't allowed to shower until Sunday.

**DAY 1 POST OP**

Nothing crazy to report. I had very minimal pain, never experienced gas pain, and wasn't nauseous. I was able to get myself in and out of bed for the most part. I didn't take any pain meds. I had no issues urinating or with bleeding because my surgeon didn't use either a catheter or manipulator. My throat was a bit sore from the intubation, and I had a bit of a cough. Luckily my abdomen didn't hurt much when I coughed.

I was really tired, though, and sitting upright for too long sucked, so I wasn't able to sit on our itty-bitty couch to watch anything. More laying, scrolling, and reading.

**DAY 2 POST OP**

On Sunday, all of the above was the same, but I had crazy shortness of breath and chest tightness. From about 8 am to 1 pm I took my inhaler 5 times, but it didn't help. I have crazy medical OCD so I don't let myself Google anything. Finally I checked my post-op instructions, and it said I should go to the ER if I experienced shortness of breath, or pain in the chest/leg, among other things. So, off we went.

The ER was actually really fast, so I'm grateful for that. They did an EKG, took my blood, and gave me chest x-rays. They said they were worried about a clot, and that's when I started Googling, which is a mistake because everything about post-op clots is scary, so I just made myself super anxious. Turned out there was no sign of a clot, but a bit of fluid in my lungs. The doctor said this was pretty common with intubation and it should clear up on its own. I also Googled fluid in lungs, which was also a mistake. Don't do it, lol.

**TIP:** Just don't Google stuff. Especially if you have OCD or anxiety like me. Everything online will make you think you're gonna die, and it just feeds the cycle. Call the surgeon's office or hospital to ask questions if something is concerning.

After the ER, we stopped at the store to get my partner frozen pizza and me sushi. Walking through the store really took it out of me, and I was back in bed all day.

This was also the first day our friend made me soup! My partner went to get it, and I was worried about not having a bowel movement even with the prescription laxative (Docusate), so he stopped for miralax, prune juice, and metamucil.

As far as surgery recovery goes, I still felt great, but I could only do activity for a short amount of time. Definitely no bending.

**DAY 3 POST OP**

Still short of breath. I managed about an hour on the couch at a time before needing to go back to bed, and my cough was a bit worse. No new pain, though. Started eating oatmeal and an apple every morning with my normal 2 cups of coffee and prune juice. Used Miralax and the Docusate, but no metamucil yet. No BM.

I was allowed to shower, and it went totally fine. I just faced away from the water and didn't put soap directly on my incisions. I needed help to dry off my legs and put on lotion, because I still couldn't bend.

**DAY 4 POST OP**

My shortness of breath relented but I got hit with a horrible head cold. Like, the kind where you have such a horrid sinus headache that your head feels like it's about to explode. I think the cold compounded with my body trying to recover from surgery, and I was back to being totally bed bound again. No couch time!

Bu, I had a bowel movement. Yippee!

Still no bending over. My partner has been grabbing anything that falls for me, or is on too low of a shelf. I can squat to get things if I need to, but it sucks on the way back up.

**DAY 5 POST OP**

Same as day 4. No Bowel movement.

**DAY 6 POST OP**

This day I had a follow-up appointment with my primary doctor for the ER visit. My shortness of breath was totally gone but the sinus headache was still there. This was my first day driving because my partner had to work. At the appointment, she said my lungs sounded great and checked out my incisions for me, and all looked good. She was curious about the bisalp and asked me a bunch of questions about it!

I felt pretty good (besides the cold) so I ordered lunch and walked around Ulta while I waited for it. This ended up being a mistake because I was completely wiped when I got home.

Got a call from the OBGYN office, and my tubes had no abnormalities. I won't be able to make a post-op appointment until the first week of March because she's out of town till then. I spent most of the day in bed.

No bowel movement :(

**DAY 7 POST OP - Valentine's day!!**

My sinus headache was GONE!!! For the first time all week, I was able to spend almost the whole day on the couch, do some of my hobbies, and feel like a person. I was still limited with my physical movement, but I was more alert mentally. I took it easy all day so I could feel good for our dinner date!

This was the first day I felt cute after being a gremlin at home all week. We went to a nice restaurant for a pretty early dinner, and I was able to get through it pretty okay. I was super sore and worn out, though, because they gave us a high-top and those need a surprising amount of effort to sit up in or lean forward in. I didn't want to bother them to move us, and I did fine, but I was beat. We stopped for ice cream, watched a movie, then watched some TV till we fell asleep.

Bowel movement!

**GENERAL TAKE-AWAYS** **AND TIPS**

Overall, I think this was much easier than I thought it would be. I was really frustrated that I wasn't able to do some of the easy hobbies I was excited for for most of the week, though. I was looking forward to crocheting, playing video games, all sorts of stuff, but the cold and the fatigue just made it so hard. I'd say to not set up any expectations for your healing and take it one step at a time.

Things that helped the most:

* Having prepared meals/having someone cook for me. Between my mom, friend, and my partner doing most of the work the couple times we cooked together, I was fed. I would not have had the energy to cook or grocery shop, and would have spent a lot on takeout or canned/frozen meals without that.
* NIGHTGOWNS WERE MY SAVIOR!!! They're SO nice for this. But maybe avoid ones with buttons on the front, because mine irritated my belly button incision a bit. Oh, and fluffy socks. I bought about three nightgowns and a few pairs of socks between November and my surgery. Walmart has cheap t-shirt sleep gowns for like $10 each, with pockets!
* Laxatives and fiber were so important. I wish I'd started Miralax before the surgery, but I had no idea I should have until after I was looking this up.
* Gatorade was really good to have on hand for hydration. I didn't want carbonation or sugar after my surgery, to avoid gas, so this was a great substitute for sparkling water or soda.
* A few days before the surgery, I by chance thrifted two pairs for Blair brand stretchy corduroy pants. I wore them a couple times, to the ER and my doctor's appointment, and they were SO comfortable. The waist band was easy to roll down, and they look pretty nice on. The elastic is also pretty soft and gentle on the incisions. I'll probably be wearing these to work this week. Highly recommend!

Things I didn't really need:

* Personally, I thought I wouldn't have much of an appetite, but I was RAVENOUS. I was eating heavy meals straight away and could not stop eating for a few days. My dad got me saltines and ginger ale from CVS, and I didn't really need them.
* I didn't end up needing the gas-x. I wasn't ever very bloated, and didn't have any gas pains.
* I ended up not using the Metamucil.

Sone random twinges and symptoms I've had:

* The shortness of breath/chest tightness from the intubation/my cold
* A few days post-op, I started getting tinglies in my feet/legs if I laid in a certain way for too long. Definitely normal, my body isn't happy about being horizontal and lazy for so long.
* Sometimes I get pins and needles feeling around my incisions. Also normal.
* Sometimes the muscles near my incisions twitch a bit. Also normal.
* I have to keep telling myself irregular bowel movements are normal. If I'm not in pain, and if I go a few times a week, it's okay.

Still waiting for my post-op, the insurance claim, and to go back to work. And for my guts to go back to normal. Usually I have a bowel movement a couple times a day, and I don't want to become dependent on the laxatives, so I've been weaning off those.

My husband recently got laid off so he has a lot of time to himself in between job searching but what bothers me is that he's a night owl. If he doesn't have an interview he usually wakes up at 3pm (later if I leave him alone) and lounges around until the sun goes down and then he'll start doing whatever needs to get done. I don't want to stay in bed with him so I feel really lonely being up and about all morning and afternoon until he decides to get moving. 

I started with trying to gently wake him up with me (I offer him coffee and lunch) and he'll go ""uh-huh"" but he goes straight back to sleep no matter how many times I try. One day I got sick of it and woke him up like I usually do but this time I told him that it makes me upset that he sleeps in all day, that's when he got frustrated with me and called me a bad wife for nagging him so much.

So levels come back and I'm at like 10 . Started taking supplements over that time (10K D3 with K2 daily) started noticing weird muscle aches and my limbs getting tired basically no reason. I've been trying to really be on top of it and seeing other doctors incase something else has been going on because my symptoms feel so intense in terms of the fatigue its hard not to convince myself I don't have cancer or something crazy. So far all the blood work I've done has come back looking alright although I have like low free testosterone (but total testosterone is fine) as well as high AM cortisol which I understand could also be related to the vit D levels.  I know everyone's different but anyone else have this hard of a time with it with levels this low? I know it can take a while for levels to come back up but I was just wondering if anyone else ever got this low and felt like no matter how much coffee they drink they're always wanting to just go lie down,2,1739651474.0,VitaminD,1,1.0,False
1iqakqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iqakqx/stay_with_me/,Stay with me,"# 1. The Song That Won’t Stop

The first time he heard the song, it was past midnight.

It started as a random recommendation—some old Japanese city pop track from decades ago. He wasn’t sure why he clicked on it. Maybe it was the thumbnail, the warm glow of stage lights. Maybe it was the name: **Stay with me.**

And then, she **sang**.

Soft, effortless, **like nostalgia for something he never lived.**

He watched her movements—the way her fingers curled around the microphone, the way she swayed ever so slightly, how she **smiled when she sang that line**. Like she was singing only for him.

He played it again. And again.

And again.

The melody followed him to bed. It felt comforting, at first. Like he had discovered **something meant for him.**

Then, at 3 AM, he woke suddenly. His body stiff. His mind blank. **Except for the song.**

It was playing **inside his head**. Not in fragments, not a faint memory—**perfectly, completely, as if he was still listening to it.**

He lay there, staring at the ceiling, her voice looping:

**Stay with me.**

The moment stretched too long. **The air in the room felt thick.**

He reached for his phone. The video was closed.

He checked his speakers. They were off.

But the song was still there.

Still playing.

**Stay with me.**



# 2. The Weight of Knowing Too Late

By morning, he told himself it was just **a strong earworm**—the kind that burrowed into your brain if you listened to a song too much. It happened. No big deal.

Except it **didn’t fade**.

At work, he caught himself humming the melody.

During lunch, he swore he heard **her voice**—not in his head, but in the background, somewhere faint, like a radio left on in another room.

He told himself it was fine. **Just a song.**

But then came the worst part.

It wasn’t just the song that lingered.

It was **her.**

Her face. Her smile. The way she looked into the camera **as if she knew him**.

He thought about her at night, **not like an artist he admired, but like a presence.** Someone he should have known. Someone he had lost.

But that made no sense. **He had found her too late.**

And that hurt in a way he didn’t understand.

He stayed up watching old interviews, hunting for any scrap of her past. But the more he read, the more something **felt wrong.**

Because he started knowing things **before** he found them.

How she liked her coffee. The way she laughed **when she wasn’t on stage.** A birthmark on her left wrist—**he was sure it was there, even before he saw it.**

He told himself he must have seen it somewhere before. His brain was just **filling in the gaps.**

But a thought crept in:

**What if I’m not remembering?**

**What if I’m learning?**



# 3. When Memories Stop Belonging to You

The first time it truly terrified him was in the café.

He sat alone, scrolling through his phone, when a song came on over the speakers.

Not hers. Some old jazz track.

And he knew—**knew**—she would have loved it.

The thought was so sure, so **immediate**, that it made his skin prickle.

Then, as if in response, something **moved in his mind**—like a reel of film shifting into place.

And he was no longer sitting in the café.

**He was backstage.** The air smelled of warm vinyl and stale perfume. He could hear the crowd outside, distant, buzzing.

He could feel the weight of earrings against his skin.

The fabric of a dress brush**ed** against his legs.

A faint pressure—someone’s hand on his shoulder, a voice telling him, *Five minutes until showtime, Matsubara-san.*

His breath hitched.

And then—**he was back.**

The café. His table. His hands.

**His hands.**

He clenched them, staring at his palms. **They didn’t feel right.**

He turned them over, half expecting to see long, delicate fingers, nails painted with a soft gloss.

But they were his. They were **his.**

He felt nauseous.

The song in his head was **still playing.**



# 4. Becoming Someone Else

That night, he tried to remember **his own childhood.**

Where he had grown up. What his mother’s voice sounded like. His first day of school.

**Nothing came.**

Instead, he remembered **her.**

The warmth of stage lights. The taste of black coffee. The rhythm of walking in heels down an empty corridor.

He looked at his reflection, breath shaking. His face was still his own.

But **for a second—just for a second—**he swore his lips moved before he spoke.

And he swore—

**The song started playing without sound.**



# 5. The Horror of Never Being Alone Again

He tried to stop.

No more songs. No more videos. No more thinking about her.

He deleted everything.

But it didn’t matter. **She was already inside him.**

At work, he heard **her voice.** Not the song—**just her voice, soft, like a thought that wasn’t his.**

In the shower, he caught himself humming. Not in his own tone, but **hers.**

And then, one night, lying in bed—**a whisper, right beside his ear.**

**""You found me too late.""**

His eyes snapped open. **The room was empty.**

And then the final horror sank in—

**The song had stopped.**

Not because it faded.

Not because he forgot.

**Because she didn’t need it anymore.**

Because now, she was **there.**



# 6. The Last Line

In the silence of his room, he took a deep breath.

And from somewhere—**not in the air, not in his ears, but inside him—**

He felt a voice that wasn’t his.

**""But I’m still here.""**



# 7. The Mirror That Doesn’t Reflect

He stopped looking in mirrors.

Because every time he did, he expected something to be **wrong.**

Something **off** about his posture, the way his lips moved **just a second too late.**

The last time he dared to look, he saw himself blink—**but felt it happen a beat too soon.**

He turned away, heart pounding.

He knew what was happening.

**His reflection was learning to move on its own.**



# 8. The Song That Never Leaves

He tried to explain it to a friend once.

""Have you ever had a song stuck in your head?""

""Yeah, of course.""

""But—what if it wasn’t just a song? What if it was a person?""

They laughed. Thought he was joking.

He tried to laugh too. But in the back of his mind, **her voice hummed softly.**

**Stay with me.**

It was no longer just a song.

It was **her breath.** **Her presence.**

She was inside him **like a thought that wasn’t his own.**

And he didn’t know how much of himself was left.



# 9. When She Speaks in His Voice

It happened in the grocery store.

A woman passed him in the aisle, accidentally brushing his shoulder.

She murmured a polite **""Excuse me.""**

And before he even thought about it, he **responded.**

Not in his own voice.

**In hers.**

A perfect imitation.

The woman froze. Gave him a strange look.

He didn’t even realize what had happened **until it was too late.**

His throat burned. He swallowed, shaking, running his tongue across his teeth. **Did they still feel like his?**

He turned and left the store without buying anything.

That night, he didn’t speak at all.

Because he didn’t know whose voice would come out if he did.



# 10. The Handwriting That Isn’t His

Days passed. Maybe weeks. He wasn’t sure anymore.

He stopped writing. Stopped texting. **Because when he picked up a pen, the words that spilled out weren’t his.**

His letters curled the wrong way. His strokes were too delicate.

He wrote in **Japanese.**

He didn’t know Japanese.

And yet, there it was—his own hand moving without hesitation.

He looked at the page. **The words were lyrics.**

**Stay with me.**

He pressed his palms against his temples, breathing heavily.

**Whose thoughts were these?**

**Whose body was this?**



# 11. The Reflection That Sings Back

He avoided mirrors for weeks.

But that night, **he made a mistake.**

A passing glance—just a flicker of movement caught in the corner of his eye.

And his reflection was **already staring at him.**

Mouth slightly open. Breathing.

Then, slowly, **it smiled.**

And it whispered, **in her voice, in her perfect, haunting tone:**

**""You found me too late.""**

His stomach lurched. His breath stopped.

The reflection lifted a hand—**but he hadn’t moved.**

And then—**it sang.**

No speakers. No recording.

Just his own lips in the mirror, **moving without him.**

**Stay with me.**



# 12. The Final Change

He stopped sleeping. Stopped eating.

There was no need.

Because the song was enough.

Because **she was enough.**

And then, one morning, he **felt it.**

A shift. A quietness. **A completion.**

He sat at his desk, hands resting calmly, breath even.

And he smiled.

Because **he was not alone anymore.**

Because **he was not himself anymore.**

Because the song no longer played in his head.

Because now, **he was the song.**





# 13. The New Recording

Months later, a video surfaced online.

An old performance of *Stay with Me*. A grainy, remastered upload of a concert long past.

Fans swore it sounded… different.

**There was a second voice.**

Soft, distant, **harmonizing with hers.**

But there was no backup singer in the original.

And in the final frame, just before the video cut—

**someone in the audience was mouthing the words.**

**Someone who wasn’t there.**

And if you listen closely, just at the end, beneath the final note—

You can hear a whisper.

**""But I’m still here.""**

Happy Valentine’s Day. 

Hi there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m here looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you enjoy witty banter, meaningful conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.


What It’s Like Dating Me

	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous day trips, movie marathons, or a hilariously intense board game night, I’ll keep life interesting.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: Cozy evenings with good food and even better company are my specialty.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of amusing, absurd, and downright ridiculous moments—I can’t wait to share them.

	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (or your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me

I’m a blend of creativity and curiosity, with a knack for finding beauty in the ordinary. I’m happiest when I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a great conversation.

Travel is a huge part of my life—I’ve visited Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and my wanderlust isn’t slowing down. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible destinations!

When I’m not traveling, I’m immersing myself in art, music, and storytelling. Whether it’s swapping favorite songs, checking out an art gallery, or discussing life’s big questions over coffee, I’m all about connecting on a deeper level.

What I’m Looking For
I’m open to connecting with women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:

	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to laugh at life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and ready to embrace new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are the foundation of meaningful connections.
	•	A Little Playful: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have some fun!

Why You Should Message Me

If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. I’ll keep you laughing, surprise you with thoughtful gestures, and make even the mundane feel special.

Whether we’re discovering a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or plotting a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories
I believe the best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and a lot of laughter. Whether it’s exploring quirky art exhibits, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or cozying up for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s as excited about the journey as I am.

Final Thoughts
Distance doesn’t scare me if we vibe—it’s all about building something meaningful. If you’re in your twenties or beyond, adventurous, grounded, and ready for something real, let’s chat. Tell me your favorite story, dream destination, or the last thing that made you laugh—I’d love to hear it.

Life’s too short for “what ifs”—let’s start something amazing.

I met this awesome girl at a bar when I was with my boyfriend and his friends. Me and her talked multiple times while waiting by the bathroom and she was so sweet and kind and a hairstylist. She gave me her hair stylist Instagram account and she’s AMAZING and even has the little blue check by her name!!! Me and her talked but it was about simple things like her beautiful hair color, what I wanted for hair color and small talk. I was also pretty drunk lol. I decided to message her when I was sober a few days later and see if she still was willing to do my hair and she said yes! We set up a day and time woooo!

Here’s my small dilemma. I have a nail artist I’m close with who I always get coffee for when I visit her. I’ve been going to this girl forever and every time I get her coffee because I know her order and we’re close now (as customer and artist lol). I plan on going to a little coffee shop near the hairstylist salon before I get my hair done because I know it’ll be a long appointment. Since I always get my nail artist coffee (and I haven’t been to an actual professional hair salon in forever, just a simple hair cuttery for trims), idk if it’s rude for me to walk in with a coffee and not get her one. I would TOTALLY get the hair stylist a coffee because she’s so sweet, but does that come off as weird because I barely know her? Is a relatively new person/customer allowed to get their artist a coffee without them being creeped out? Can any artists tap in?

Please help, I’ve tried posting in r/pseudodysphagia as that’s what I technically have but it seems that sub is no longer active. I’m really desperate for some advice and solidarity. I’ve literally forgotten how to swallow purely from anxiety. I first dealt with this years ago and it has its flair ups but I don’t think I’ve ever dealt with it this bad before. I can’t even get water and liquids down let alone solids. I’m scared of choking/aspirating. What makes this fear more real and scary for me is sometimes when I go to initiate a swallow I end up gagging/almost choking. I literally almost choked on a huge gulp of water 2 hours ago because it’s like my swallow just doesn’t follow through. I’m guessing it’s out of subconscious fear? It’s like my natural swallow reflex is gone and I have to do it manually but even then I don’t feel safe to swallow. I’ve been checked before for physical problems and I didn’t have any so this is purely from anxiety. I haven’t eaten solids in over a week now and I can barely get down a high calorie smoothie or water. I’m really scared and embarrassed and ashamed. Right now it seems like there’s no way out. Please please if anyone can relate let me know. I can’t afford therapy otherwise I’d be doing that asap but for now I literally have to get out of this myself. I’m concerned for my health, I don’t want to lose weight and I want to enjoy food and a simple coffee again. I don’t know what to do. Thank you for reading ",3,1739650720.0,ARFID,2,1.0,False

1iqa7q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iqa7q7/blue_valentine_another_v_day_disappointment_post/,blue valentine (another v day disappointment post),"i (27 f) have been married to my husband (27 m) for 4 years. we’ve been together for 5 years next week. funnily enough, we met on Valentine’s Day 2020 before going on our first date a week later.

my husband loves me deeply and cares for me every day in small ways. he makes me coffee, cleans up after our cat, and when we’re watching tv will play with my hair which he knows i like. 

at the same time, I love him deeply, too and show how i care on a daily basis. I do the dishes (bc they make him anxious af), i handle our finances, i plan our meals for the week and make grocery lists, when we go on vacations i plan everything down to a t etc im type A so, although it takes a lot of energy, I don’t mind carrying more of the weight with the every day stuff.

for special occasions, however, I feel like there’s an imbalance. both of us have experienced mental health struggles - i had an extremely rough time the first year of our relationship and serious stuff until, q3 of 2023 when I radically transformed my outlook and took steps to address my mental health issues.

My husband has been anxious his whole life - put on meds when he was a third grader - and has always referenced how he met me on an upswing when he felt randomly ok for a year.  A little after we got married, he suddenly dipped down into the depths of anxiety and ever since then it’s been mainly anxious with small improvements after me begging time and time again for him to go to therapy.

I’m his only therapist - he doesn’t talk to his friends or family about anything emotional. He hasn’t seen a therapist in years since we moved across the country in 2023 and he had an intake session a few weeks ago and failed to follow up to book the next appointment. I’m forcing him to do it this week because it’s draining for me to constantly act as therapist and bc of his situation I feel like I can’t even vent to him about my emotions - and i already know im valid for feeling that and don’t care if anyone judges me. Another context is we are financially not in the best spot and so im prioritizing him going to therapy in terms of cost and I’ll talk to my family or friends.

Anyways the reason why there is a tonne of context here is because this year i told my husband I wanted to break us out of our rut of watching a movie and lounging around on weekends, and actually plan date nights. We’d alternate weeks. So far I’ve planned some nice, cheap (since we are financially in saving mode to move later this year) dates. For example, taking him to a free gallery night and planning a games night. Simple stuff but still something other than vegetating. He skipped his date nights because he was too overwhelmed.

When this happened last month, i told him after he skipped planning one of his date nights that I expect the bare minimum to be a cheap box of chocolates and grocery store flowers as well as communication that he’s too overwhelmed or anxious. I made it very clear. He was also aware his next date night was V day.

Last week we got some really good news that he was accepted to an MFA program - his dream program - and since it was my date night week I threw him a date night revolving around his program and our imminent move. I told him in advance this date night we’d spend $ since it would be celebrating this win, Valentine’s Day, and our dating anniversary meal money all in one, and that we can do something smaller for the other days coming up in rapid succession.

I made tiramisu the day before, in advance bought stuff to make cocktails in the theme of the city abroad we’d be moving to for his MFA, booked a nice restaurant for dinner, and even had an old school movie from the country we’ll be moving to picked out for post dinner and drinks to watch w tiramisu. The point being I took time out of my week to plan and put this together.

For context, i work 3 jobs to support us. He works 2. We both work equally hard in my eyes. Last week we had an amazing night.

Anyways, yesterday is V day. He had told me on Wednesday or Thursday he booked us a movie (we have AMC a list and watch movies every Friday/Saturday so I didn’t see this as anything majorly special). He also told me he’d be cooking us a nice meal since we didn’t want to spend a tonne on a restaurant (we live in a major city in the US). I was like cool - I expected a nice home cooked meal after the movie and chocolates/flowers.

After the movie yesterday, we’re walking home and he says he needs to go to the grocery store (I.e. he hadn’t gotten anything he needed to cook beforehand). I was like OK I’ll go to the gym then. I go home first and am changing for the gym since he needs time to cook etc and he comes home w stuff to cook dinner. He hands me a Trader Joe’s plastic package thing of like jingle jangle and says “they had no chocolate boxes left so happy v day”. I was like oh okay thanks.

And then I was waiting/looked around. Eventually I said “so im guessing they were out of flowers, too?” And he said yeah there was nothing worth buying.

Here, I felt my face literally drop. I made it very clear weeks ago what my expectations were for when he wasn’t up to doing a date night. And now on V day when he’s already doing the bare minimum of booking a movie at AMC, where we go every week regardless, and making dinner - which I do every week anyways - he couldn’t even get a fuckinf box of chocolates and flowers or get the stuff for dinner beforehand?

I went to the gym and ran, came back and he let me know appetizers (Trader Joe’s pizza bites) were ready. I said I needed to shower first (usually I postpone showering til after we eat dinner to accommodate for the fact that he would have to wait for me). I cried in the shower and came out after. I guess it was clear I was upset.

He had served dinner up and was lighting a candle we already had. The dinner table on one side was cluttered full of random stuff accumulated over the week. When I have made nice dinners in the past I make sure to clear the whole table etc.

Anyways, it was clear I was upset and he asked. I said I don’t want to further ruin everything and he said well now it’s tense and so I cried through explaining how I felt uncared for and in stark contrast to this amazing night I threw last week this felt like not even the bare minimum I had specifically communicated was fulfilled. I told him I was very grateful for the meal and the snack chocolate from Trader Joe’s, but that I had laid out exactly what I wanted and yet still even that minimum wasn’t fulfilled.

He in turn was hurt that the meal wasn’t enough and that he is overwhelmed and can’t believe that just bc he didn’t get flowers or a box of chocolates everything got ruined. He said he planned to get flowers the next day.

I told him the fact that he hadn’t planned in advance to me indicates that this isn’t important to him - spending quality time with intention.

We literally argued for an hour and then watched tv and went to bed.

I woke up just miserable and am going out to get myself flowers and maybe chocolate bc I know what I deserve and how I deserve to be treated and I don’t need to wait for anyone to give me what I want. He works Saturdays so he already was gone when I woke up.

At the same time, I feel like maybe im being unreasonable? I feel like he thinks im being unreasonable? I’m also embarrassed that I showed I cared bc im not a high maintenance girl who NEEDS chocolates and flowers but I just mentioned it bc I want to spend quality time and feel like we are intentional with each other. 

I’m just sad and wanted to see if anyone else has a similar experience. I love my husband and I know he loves me, but idk why he just can’t ever get it right even when he’s told exactly what to do.",0,1739650500.0,Marriage,1,0.5,False

I recently started taking (day 4) dexmethylphenidate ER 10mg for my ADHD, and while it’s definitely helping with focus and motivation, I’ve been experiencing some intense emotional fluctuations that are really draining. I wanted to see if anyone else has gone through this and whether it evens out over time.

What I’m Experiencing:
	1.	Mood Swings – I’ll feel super motivated, productive, and even euphoric for a few hours, and then suddenly, I hit a wall of emotional exhaustion. Sometimes I get irritable or anxious out of nowhere.
	2.	Energy Crashes – My energy feels great for the first half of the dose, but as it fades, I feel drained—mentally and physically. I get this sense of burnout like I’ve been running on fumes.

I’m trying to figure out:
	•	Is this just my body adjusting? (I’ve only been on it for a short time)
	•	Could supplements, hydration, or certain foods help balance this out?

Note - I have a habit of drinking at least a cup of coffee per day.

If you’ve had a similar experience, how did you manage it? Did things level out for you after a few weeks, or did you have to switch meds? I’d really appreciate any insights!

Except this one time.

I struck up a conversation with a reddit user from Portugal and and whether it was my wit and charm shining through or just his love for spontaneity, he offered to visit me in Brussels. I suggested exchanging photos beforehand (I’ll admit, I’m a bit insecure—I don’t fit the traditional European beauty standards), but he proposed a blind date instead. I’m not one to shy away from adventure, so after exchanging brief descriptions of our appearances, I agreed. I recommended a stay at hotel X, he picked restaurant Y for dinner, and we settled on gifts Z and Z\*—the plan was coming together. 

  
He arrived a little after noon on Friday the 14th in Brussels. Around 7pm we met at the hotel bar and... - surprise! - he was actually good looking and cute?! On top of that, he was generous, bringing along a gift for our dinner date, just as we had discussed. 

Everything was going smoothly… until we arrived at the restaurant. Despite our reservation, they had no free tables, and the waiting line was full of other couples who had also booked ahead. Not ideal. We decided to try our luck elsewhere and, after one rejection, my well-timed sob story to a waiter—plus the perfect timing of a group leaving—landed us a cozy table at a well-known Brussels restaurant. He was  amazed by the little magic trick I pulled with the waiter, but what can I say? I’m used to getting my way.

Dinner was amazing, and the chemistry between us was undeniable. What happened afterward? Well… let’s just say it’s not typically recommended after a first M&G, but his time in Brussels was limited—if you catch my drift. 

Like a true gentleman, he ordered me an Uber home to make sure I got back safely. We had planned to meet again today for coffee and a museum visit, but unfortunately, he woke up feeling feverish—I blame a mix of airplane germs and a bit too much *Château Migraine.* I had planned to surprise him with my favorite chocolates (which I call ""working-class chocolates""—100% Belgian, affordable, and just simply good), but I guess that will have to wait for our next date.

have to add—he made me feel safe, and he made sure I was. I would never fly to meet someone I’ve never met (there are far too many horror stories out there), but having someone come to me worked out really well.

For the first time in my life, Valentine's Day turned out to be unexpectedly wonderful. I feel incredibly lucky to have crossed paths with someone as genuine as I am. Wishing all of you who are pure of heart the same kind of (blind) date magic. ❤️
