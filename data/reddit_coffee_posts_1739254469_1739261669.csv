1imts29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1imts29/1800torment/,1-800-Torment,"Most people, myself included, reminisce at the end of their lives. I expected that, but not the reminiscing that came after. I was an indebted divorce attorney working on my first case. My client Bob was an asshole. He cheated on his wife Mary with many different women, always showed up to hearings late, insulted the other side's lawyers, and missed his kids' sports games. I needed to win the case. I was broke and could not afford the loss to my reputation.

One weekend, while helping clean my parents’ attic, I stumbled upon a strange number in an old phone book.

*Want revenge? Want the people standing in your way brought down? Then call 1-800-Torment.* I had nothing to lose from trying this strange number; I punched the buttons into my landline.

“Welcome to the Torment Phone Line, please explain your issue,” a monotone voice spoke.

“I am a divorce attorney and I want the adverse party to suffer so I can win my case.”

“That can certainly be arranged,” they spoke as my fingers twisted the phone cord around my hand, “how would you like the suffering to be administered? Nightmares, a series of misfortunes to drive them crazy, or perhaps a deadly accident?”

“Keep them alive but don’t give them a single moment of rest until I win the trial.” The voice cackled static and the line disconnected.

Mary's eyes were bloodshot with dark bags. Her hairs poked out uncombed from her head as she arrived late in the courtroom. Her image juxtaposed with the alert and (justifiably) indignant woman of a few days prior. Her condition would further deteriorate. In the end, Bob kept more of the disputed assets than either of us expected and would go on to marry (and later divorce) another woman. I made $20,000 from the case with a $500 bill from the Torment Phone Line and my choice of wealthy clients. Mary would recover and find a new normal.

Sure, I felt bad for my actions but I wanted to finance my American Dream and the Torment Phone Line helped me get there time and time again. As we grew old together, my wife and kids never knew why exactly I was so successful and as my family stood crying over me, I smiled for all we experienced together. I died with no regrets.

I woke up with a backache in a hard plastic office chair. There were no windows in the grey cubicle size room, only a desk with a coffee maker and landline phone. The phone rang and I picked it up hoping for answers.

“Hi, is this the Torment Phone Line?”

“Yes, please explain your issue,” the words spewed out of me like vomit. The calls continued endlessly. Whenever the tide of voices relented I searched the room, unable to find a window, door, or air vent. I drank the ashtray flavored coffee and somehow never slept.

Over the years I’ve tried every imaginable method of escape. I claw at the walls only to bloody my fists. I tried to ignore the calls only for them to buzz like a saw through my mind. Pain like an inferno burns my tongue when I try to deviate from my call script. After they hang up, I scream knowing no one will hear.

I wonder how 1-800-Torment started. I know I heard the same operators during my fifty years using the line. Will I ever be free? I try to be at peace with my ending because there is no enjoyable alternative. I try to find peace in answering the calls. I try to make it into a form of meditation. The thought that the Torment Phone Line seems to be growing lingers, I hear more and more new callers by the day. There used to be several repeat customers but now I rarely hear the same voice twice.

Some nights like tonight, when I can’t sleep, and it’s so quiet…I think about you, your blue sheets, and your bare walls. I think about the cold of Chicago, the rough stubble along your jaw. I think about your arms, and your warmth. I think about the heat of your skin and how you hugged me for a while after I teased you about seeing other people after we were done. Because you didn’t want to let go just yet, even though we both said we would only be for a little while. 

I still think about your green t-shirt, the one you let me borrow for the first time to wear at night. I think about how I fell asleep next to you, watching Dr. Who. I think about the way you kissed me for the first time against a wall. I remember how you held my hand that one night in public for the first time, when no one could see. I remember Maria’s, toward the end. I remember how I rubbed the stem of a wine glass to not cry because we would only be for a little while, and I wanted to spend all the time I could with you. And I wanted you to remember me in the best light, when my heart was shattering in ways I didn’t quite yet understand back then. 

Sometimes, I think about the weekend you left, when I need to remember to behave. And how everything felt so empty afterward. And how I could never tell you the way I laid in bed for a very long time. I knew back then what I signed up for. I just never expected you to linger the way you did, still all these years later.

That’s what holds me back from responding, Travis. I know I can’t be your friend. I’ve tried so many times, but I’ll always want you in all the ways that could never happen.",1,1739261205.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

**Why Choose a Rattan Coffee Table?**

Rattan furniture has been a popular choice for decades due to its lightweight yet sturdy structure and its ability to complement various interior styles, from bohemian to modern chic. Here’s why a rattan coffee table is a must-have in your home:

**Timeless Appeal:** Rattan exudes a natural, organic aesthetic that blends seamlessly with modern, coastal, and rustic décor.

**Styling Tip:** Pair a large rattan coffee table with neutral-toned sofas and woven baskets for a cozy, layered look. Add a statement vase or decorative books to enhance its visual appeal.

Im sorry in advance if this story is too long for y'all but I just want to give you guys a background of the story because it is required to understand my point of view.

I, 25F have been best friends with my friend I will call Sandra (fake name) 24F since we was in elementary school. We are super close she is practically like a sister to me and we are in fact so close, people tend to think we are actually sisters. But we look nothing like each other because I'm biracial and she is white/mexican. 

There would be times in our friendship where we wouldn't talk really anymore ever since she left school early one day in 6th grade and she never came back for reasons going on at home. She's had a very rough childhood, her mom wasn't in her life, her dad always in and out of jail and her grandmother that raises her always doing drugs. It would be Sandra and her little brother J. However my childhood, in the beginning my mom was living paycheck to paycheck we couldn't always get what we wanted but her bf (my brothers dad) had money so  every Christmas that's when we would get all the things we practically wanted. Then in 2016 my mom graduated college with an RN degree to her name. I was 16-17 and that's when my mom low-key spoiled us. We always had the latest iPhones and whatnot but we wasn't rich. Me and Sandra was still friends even then she and her grandma and brother moved an hour away from where I lived and went to a whole new school. We would talk on the phone and snapchat each other whenever she had the chance. (again  she had a rough life.) Every summer since she had moved away, she would stay over at my house for 2 weeks and we would have a blast! Post on vine, make funny snapchat videos (skits) she even got me out there on instagram and I ended up with a hunk of her followers because she was like a social butterfly. She was the popular one in high school however, I was popular as well I was on the cheer team but, I just preferred to be alone I guess you could say, a loner popular girl. One day when Sandra was at my house for the 2 week during the summer break, my mom came into my room while we was doing our hair to take pictures, she says pack up we are going to Jacksonville,FL to visit your family. 

Sandra can come with as well. We was so excited it was going to be our first time going to Florida together. Fastforward we go, we have a blast but then in the middle of the trip, she started acting cold and distant towards me. I had no idea what was up her ive asked if everything was okay but she would say everything was fine she was just tired. The following day, she was still cold and distant towards me and then she started acting cold towards my brother as well. The vibe was so bad even my aunt noticed and asked my mom ""Yo what's going on with the kids?"" 

I don't even really remember much on the trip, I just remembered her acting cold to everyone. As time went on we made our way back to our home state it was a 16 hour drive, but I can't remember if she was acting cold on the trip home. But I remember that night when we arrived to my mother's house, me and Sandra chilled in my bed watching Jerry Springer's show called Baggage. It was my first time watching it so I was hooked. I started to get tired and we decided to just go to sleep. I felt her spooning me and wrapped her arms around me. I just thought maybe she just felt upset and cuddling made her feel at peace. 

Fast forward to 6 years later, I had my first daughter in Feb. 2020 we was not talking at that time for I can't remember why. So she knew I was pregnant and even congratulated me, but she never was there for the gender reveal, birth or even bought her a gift a cute God mother gift. I want to say, March of 2020, she got into a relationship with this girl we will call Polly. Polly was okay for the most part but when we would all hang out, she seemed jealous of me and Sandra's friendship. Sandra called me asking if she could come over so Polly and I could meet establish a friendship. I was kool with it. We met, showed her my artwork, talked about hobbies and things me and Sandra used to do. We eventually got each others numbers and snapchats so we would all have a way to contact each other and tag each other into or fun crazy adventures. They stayed over for a few hours then left. 

In July 2020, I broken up with my daughter's dad and we moved back to my mom's house. I broke up with him because I suspected cheating because I had found a MAC makeup brush under the coffee table while I was vacuuming the house. I don't use MAC products, neither does Sandra and besides she don't really wear makeup unless she asks me to do it. So we moved back to my mothers and Sandra actually helped me move, she helped me load up my furniture in the u-haul and I drove the truck she rode with me as my brother and his homeboy drove my car following us to my moms house. Later that night at my mom's house, we invited Polly over so we could chill in the car with her and smoke some green. Don't worry, my daughter was sleeping her in bed in my room, while my mom chilled in my bed watching Netflix as I was out in my front yard in Polly's car. However my mom didn't know what we was doing, even tho I was 21 at that time, I felt like my mom would had been extremely pissed if she found out I was smoking green. 30 minutes later, we go back inside and Polly leaves to go home. My mom left my room and me and Sandra chilled in my bed talked about any and everything, from religion, to life, to people, and food. Then we crashed and she left the following day. 

Fast forward to September of 2020. I had not seen Sandra since she helped me move out my ex's apartment. We would text and snapchat each other, but that was it. Until one day, all of a sudden, I get this text from snapchat from Sandra saying, ""I don't think we should be friends anymore, I have a lot going on in my life and I think its best we don't communicate anymore I will be blocking you as well."" I texted her back saying like why, what's going on, did I do something or say something wrong? The message was opened, and then I was blocked. I was absolutely heartbroken. I didn't understand what the reason was to why our friendship had ended.

 3 years later, I'm in a new relationship and now engaged, been thru hell and back trials and tribulations, and even had my second daughter! One day, I'm scrolling on Facebook and seen Sandra's name I talked to my fiancé about what I had seen because, he knows only OF Sandra they never met but I would talk about Sandra to him as if we were still friends or something. idk, we made a lot of memories and even tho our friendship ended out of nowhere for no reason, I still talk highly of her and occasionally bring up the memories or daydream of the old times. My fiancé we will call Tyler, knows that Sandra was the one who ended our friendship because of me telling him. He says that I should reach out to her, send her a friend request and get closure on what had happened. I wasn't too sure if I should or not so I didn't send her a friend request. 

I go to my local store to get some gas so I could complete my errands and I had seen her,,, SANDRA WORKING THE FRONT REGISTER.... 

  
I debated if I should go to the second register, there was no one at the second register but I took my chances on waiting for someone. As I walked to the second register, a worker told me that the lady would check me out at the first register!!!!!!! The one Sandra was at!!!

I had no choice but to face Sandra. She seemed shocked and happy to see me she actually came from behind the counter and gave me a hug.... I was shocked, I didn't know how to feel I thought she hated my guts for whatever reason. We chatted a little bit general talk of ""How's life, are you and Polly still together?"" etc. Her and Polly was still together which I was low-key shocked in a way. I gave her my money for the gas and left the store and went on with my day and errands. Later that day, I told Tyler that I seen Sandra at such and such store in town. He asked how did she seemed to act if she seen me I responded shockingly, happy as hell..... it was weird. 

  
After that I still didn't send her a friend request on Facebook, because I felt confused and weird. Weeks go on, and I get a notification on my phone that I had a friend request from Sandra on Facebook.... I clicked on her profile and noticed that she was in a relationship, but with a guy... Now I failed to mention this but, I knew Sandra was bisexual because she came out to my family when she was 18. And ever since then she's always been with women. So it was a shock to see that she was in a relationship with a guy. I ended up accepting her request and she immediently texted me on messenger. We chatted and caught up asking ""So what happened to you and Polly?"" To her response, she says they just didn't work out. Few days later, I asked my fiancé, Tyler, if it would be okay if I invited Sandra over one day for us to hangout and catch up, and them meet because Ive always felt like they would get along so swell. He says yes and that he would invite his cousin as well and we could all have a bonfire that it would have to be a night were the baby would have to be at one of or parents for the night. I agreed, we made future arrangements for our daughter. I pick up Sandra because, she didn't have a car and Tylers cousin came over because he had a truck. (we are country Louisiana folks). Tylers mom comes and picks up our daughter and I come back with Sandra. We start the fire, and connected the phone to the bluetooth speaker, and cracked open a few beers, except for the cousin because he had to drive back home. We all had a good time, me and Sandra talked and she told me the reason why her and Polly broke up was because Polly was toxic and abusive and things got out of hand so bad, her family had to have a come to Jesus meeting with her. She mentions she was losing a lot of weight, wouldn't eat, etc. I felt really bad for her, I comforted her, and let her know that her feelings were valid. 

I finally asked the number one question that has been killing me for YEARSS ""Why did you ended our friendship so suddenly?"" Which to her response was, ""Polly was not only toxic and abusive, but that part came in later after I ended our friendship because, Polly was very very jealous of you because we was friends way before we got together, and she always said that I shouldn't have pretty friends."" I was shocked but I could also low-key see that coming. I just needed closure. But then she brought up her new partner, Terry (fake name) that he's awesome, he's soo good to her, etc. etc. And that they are actively trying for a baby.  Tyler asked ""Wait, how long have y'all been together?"" Sandra responded ""3 months."" 3 months into a relationship, and trying for a baby is CRAZY WORKS...

I didn't really know Tyler that well at 3 months, I couldn't imagine trying for a baby at that point in our relationship. I expressed how I thought she might want to slow things down 9 notches because having a baby with someone is forever, a forever bond. And to not at least be engaged, I explained to her in my past relationship I wasn't even engaged and we had a daughter together and things went left in our relationship now, I'm in an active court battle with my oldest and I see the damage it does to her at only 4 years old... I expressed that she don't want that on her baby and to wait, give it some time your still young and to have fun, go on crazy schemes together make memories and get to know one another first. She protested that she was standing on business that she's gonna get her baby soon...

Fast forward to one month, Tyler gets arrested for reasons, and I ended up moving with my daughters into a bigger home a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house because court is getting hot and in case I was to win custody, I wanted to make sure everyone had their own rooms. I was so excited and happy especially my oldest, she picked out her room between the two rooms and we started shopping for decorations, the fun bubble bath soaps, and a new bed comforter. Now I have a full furnished home, and sometimes my mother would stay the night at my house and we would watch Grey's Anatomy together. Sometimes, even Sandra. 

One day in July 2024,Sandra texted my phone it was an image text. I opened the text and it was 3 pregnancy tests.... They were all positive.. Her and Terry was having a baby... I was happy and excited for her at first then reality hit, and I thought to myself, oh gosh... But ive always kept it to myself. A week or so later, we decided it was time to hangout again I picked her up and we all got food to make at my house and we went to my house. We made party wings, and had fries as well. My oldest was staying the night at my mom's house but I had my youngest she was 11 months old at the time. We was having fun! Sandra was holding my baby and they was laughing having a good time, we was playing music just making memories and Sandra's phone ranged, she puts my baby down and she walks to me, I pick her up as Sandra answered her call. Her smile she once had quickly turned into pure utter wailing. I knew she had received bad news so I put my baby in her bed, turned on Ms. Rachel and went back to Sandra. She was in my living room curled up in fetal position on the floor just crying badddd. I didn't know what to do so I just sat beside her and comforted her. She then tell me that Terry was arrested for flight from an officer going 120 mph. She was scared for the future of her family so I comforted her. And we ate the wings and just called it a night. 

I went to my bed to sleep and Sandra slept in the living room on the couch because I don't have a guest bed and didn't want anyone but my oldest to sleep in her bed because she has a twin bed. And it's her bed, I don't agree with anyone other than my daughter to sleep in her bed. I was awaken in the middle of the night to Sandra hitting my foot. I was half asleep and I remember her asking if she could sleep in my bed with me. I was so tired I was like yeah sure. I went back into my sleep so fast I jerked. Then I woke up again to a very familiar sensation something I haven't felt in a long time but only something me and my fiancé, Tyler would do. And I woke up not to Tyler cause he is still in jail but to Sandra with her hand in my shirt!!!! I immediently woke up and was extremely confused and embarrassed. ""WTF IS YOU DOING??!?!?!?!"" She quickly moved her hand out of my shirt and I could tell she looked embarrassed herself. Sandra begins to say that she always wanted me and found me sexy blablabla but one thing that stuck out to me, that she said she forgot how beautiful I was and that night she had met Tyler back at our old house, she quoted it took everything in her power not to snatch me in a room and just had me to herself and that I didn't need to be with Tyler but to be with her instead because she has always loved me but didn't know how I would take it or if I would even love her back in that way. Now we do say I love you or love you girl etc. but that's what best best best girls would say when they are really good friends. Im straight and NOT lesbian or bi-sexual. I told her that she needed to sleep on the couch and to not come back into my room.

She made her way into my living room and I laid in my bed then I thought, let me grab my daughter and lock my door. So I grabbed my baby out of her bed and we went back to my room and I locked my door so Sandra couldn't come back in. I couldn't sleep anymore I laid in my bed with my baby wide awake trying to process what just happened... Why would she do that to me when she was just wailing over her boyfriend a few hours ago??? Did I really just get SA by a pregnant lady??!?!?! NO WAY... The next morning, I came up with a lame excuse for her having to leave by saying ""My baby wants me to stay the night at my mom's house."" Knowing damn well that baby can't speak no English lol I didn't care, I did NOT WANT HER IN MY HOME FOR ANOTHER NIGHT.!!!

I then told Tyler about what had happened, ""I got SA by a pregnant woman last night."" Of course I told him it was Sandra and he was pissed he says he don't want nothing to do with her anymore and would advise me to cut her off out of respect for our relationship and that she crossed the line. I agreed, so I blocked her on all social media platforms including VIA text messages. I even thought about changing my phone number so she wouldn't make a text now number and harass me that way. I feel so disgusted. She knows about my past how my older cousin SA me when I was 6 years old. I trusted my cousin and she took a chunk of my childhood away it took me years to move past that but during those years, I felt empty and disgusted... And to be SA by my best friend, it brought back a lot of old trauma and those same thoughts I had 15 years ago. I was heart broken when she ended our friendship 3 years ago, but now, I feel worse. I feel like I should had never gotten the closure and just went on with my life if I would had, none of this would had happened to me. Fast forward 5 months, ive talked with my counselor about my experience, and she's not really much help at all tbh. My fiancé will be home in 5 months and I want to try to heal as much as possible from this and not bring new trauma to him when we get into the bedroom. 

After months of having Sandra blocked, her baby is due end of next month and sadly and stupid of me, I thought about visiting her when she delivers her baby. But now that ive had time to think, why should I? She wasn't there for any of my births, plus what she did to me, was unacceptable. Ive forgiven her because I believe no one should live with guilt in their hearts and that we should forgive others for ourselves, not for them. And that forgiveness doesn't mean we rekindle things, it simply means moving forward with a clean clear heart. Ive not texted her that I forgiven her but it was one of them times ive talked to myself as if I was talking to her face to face, and I expressed how she made me feel that night and that I simply forgive her. AITA for not going to support her at the hospital on her delivery for her baby?

College can be overwhelming, especially when deadlines start piling up. I remember my first semester—juggling multiple essays, group projects, and exams felt impossible. I barely had time to sleep, and my stress levels were through the roof. But over time, I found a few strategies that made things a lot easier, so I wanted to share them with you!

1️⃣ **Time Management is Key** 🕒  
At first, I used to procrastinate a lot, which led to all-nighters before deadlines. But then I started using a planner (Google Calendar works great too) and scheduled specific time slots for studying, writing, and even breaks. It helped me stay on track and avoid last-minute panic.

2️⃣ **Use Online Resources** 📚  
I discovered so many websites that saved my life—Quizlet for quick revision, Khan Academy for tough subjects, and even writing services when I was completely stuck. If you're struggling with essays, there are platforms where you can get writing tips or editing help.

3️⃣ **Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help** 🤝  
I used to feel embarrassed about asking professors or classmates for help, but honestly, everyone struggles with something. Office hours are there for a reason, and study groups can make even the hardest subjects more manageable.

4️⃣ **Take Care of Yourself** ☕  
Burnout is real. I used to survive on coffee and junk food, but it only made me more exhausted. Once I started sleeping properly and eating better, I noticed a huge difference in my focus and motivation.

College is tough, but trust me, it’s manageable with the right approach. What are your best tips for surviving the semester? Let’s help each other out! 🚀",1,1739260447.0,PaperChasersClub,0,1.0,False

#Product of Canada

This is the gold standard for Canadian products. It means that 98% of everything - ingredients, processing, and labour - comes from Canada. However, 2% of imported ingredients (like spices or food additives) are allowed to finish the product.

Example: A jar of honey labelled ""Product of Canada"" means it was harvested from Canadian bees and processed here, though 2% of imported ingredients might be added.


#Made in Canada

This means the final product was put together here, but some ingredients or materials might be from other countries. At least 51% of production costs (but less than 98%) must be spent in Canada. A qualifying statement must also be added explaining whether the ingredients or materials are sourced from Canada or includes imported products. This statement usually follows the “Made in Canada” notation and includes wording like ‘from imported ingredients’ or ‘from domestic and imported ingredients.’

Example: A frozen pizza labelled ""Made in Canada from domestic and imported ingredients"" means it was assembled and cooked here, but some toppings - like olives or certain cheeses - may have come from elsewhere.


#100% Canadian

Everything - ingredients, labour, and processing - is completely Canadian.

Example: A block of cheddar cheese labelled ""100% Canadian"" means the milk came from Canadian cows, and the cheese was made and packaged here.


#Designed in Canada

The product was dreamed up here in Canada, but it was made somewhere else.

Example: A pair of sneakers labelled ""Designed in Canada"" might have been designed by a Canadian company, but the shoes themselves were manufactured overseas.


#Canadian-Owned

This only tells you that the company is owned by Canadians - it doesn’t mean the product was made here.

Example: A clothing brand owned by Canadians but manufacturing its clothes overseas would be Canadian-owned but not Made in Canada.


#Packaged in Canada

This means the product was packaged or processed here, but the main ingredients or parts could be imported.

Example: Frozen strawberries grown in Mexico but washed, cut, and packaged in Canada would carry this label.


#Prepared in Canada

The product was processed or cooked here, but some or all ingredients were imported.

Example: A bag of coffee labeled ""Prepared in Canada from imported beans"" means the beans were roasted and ground in Canada, but they were grown in another country.

$$$


Watch Out for Misleading Labels!
​
Seeing ""Imported by"" or ""Canadian-owned"" on a package? That doesn’t mean the product itself is Canadian. Always check the fine print!

Knowing what the labels mean makes it easier to put your money where it matters - supporting businesses that truly make their products in Canada.

For more information on these labels, please visit the [Origin Claims on Food Labels page on the Government of Canada website](https://inspection.canada.ca/en/food-labels/labelling/industry/origin-claims)",3,1739259999.0,BuyCanadian,0,1.0,False

Hey Morgan and Friends,

I listen to Two Hot Takes religiously and I can never get enough. You all have great takes and are able to articulate so well your opinions. I have a situation that I really need advice on but I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone around me.

Recently, I (25F) met a guy on bumble (29M). We went out for coffee and immediately I felt a connection. He’s super interesting, well spoken, and seems very genuine. He’s also super cute (haha). We ended up going for a walk after the date and idk, it just felt really real. He asked me really good questions. I’ve never felt like this for anyone I’ve gone out with. After our date, I called my best friend to tell her about it. Honestly, this might sound crazy, but it feels right.

For context, I’ve had really shitty relations ships in the past, and I have trust and commitment issues because of that. I also have serious abandonment issues (don’t worry, I’m in therapy and we’re working on it lol). I’ve only met him once, but I already feel like I can trust him. It feels so easy with him. 

We already made plans to go out this sunday, and I’ve been really looking forward to it. Here’s where the story gets…interesting. I always look up the people I go out with for public court cases, sex offender registry, etc. Today, I found a news clip about him from 7 years ago (when he was 22), he was being accused of a felony (I won’t go into details as it would be identifying). Now I can’t find anything about whether or not he was actually convicted. But now I’m feeling kind of deflated. I mean, I feel a serious connection to this guy. He’s a very passionate guy, and from what I can tell from his social media, he does have a few posts sort of eluding to his past, that he has remorse and is… reformed, I guess?

I’m of the opinion that people make stupid mistakes sometimes, and as long as you learn from them and truly are apologetic, things can be forgiven. I’m also a Christian, and a big part of my faith is giving grace and not judging people. I know I need to bring it up, but how do I bring it up? Considering my trust issues, I’m worried that I won’t be able to move past it?

I’m sorry if this is all kind of a jumble. My mind is going a million miles a minute right now. I’m so conflicted.

A little background: I've been dating two guys recently, and I can’t seem to make up my mind. On one hand, there's *Ethan*, the man I’ve been with for almost a year. He’s incredibly rich—he comes from a family that owns a huge tech company, and money is never an issue. The problem is, I don’t think he truly loves me. He’s nice to me, but it’s clear he’s emotionally distant. He gives me lavish gifts, takes me on fancy vacations, and treats me like I’m an accessory to his life. We don’t have deep conversations, and the affection I get from him feels kind of surface-level. But, hey, he has the life that most people dream of.

Then there’s *Max*. Max is everything I could ever want in a partner: kind, caring, and he loves me with all his heart. He’s always there for me, listens to my thoughts, and makes me feel like I’m the most important person in the world. But Max doesn’t have much money. He works hard at a local coffee shop, and while he’s incredibly talented in graphic design, he’s still building his career. He’s not broke, but he’s not swimming in wealth, either.

I’ve known Max for a while now, and I can’t deny that I feel a deep emotional connection with him. But I’ve also felt conflicted because I’ve always dreamed of a life of comfort—luxury, nice things, and security. Ethan offers that, but he’s emotionally unavailable. Max, on the other hand, has none of that financial stability but gives me all the emotional warmth I could ever ask for.

Here’s where I made the decision that I’m now questioning. I stayed with Ethan. I told myself it was because I wanted the stability, the luxury, and the life I’ve always dreamed of. Max was great, but in the back of my mind, I couldn’t shake the fear of what my life would look like without financial security. Would I end up struggling with him? Could I live without the luxuries I’ve gotten so used to? I chose Ethan because he could provide that for me.

Max found out. I tried to break it to him gently, but he was heartbroken. He told me that I was choosing money over love, that he couldn’t compete with someone who could give me the life I wanted. He said he’d always love me, but it wasn’t enough. It was painful to watch him walk away, but part of me felt like I couldn’t risk a future where I had to settle for less, financially speaking.

Now, I’m with Ethan, and while life is great on the outside—fancy dinners, vacations, expensive gifts—I can’t help but feel empty. I don’t think Ethan loves me the way I need, and I know deep down, I’ll never feel the way I did with Max. I keep wondering if I made the wrong choice. Maybe I should have been with Max and built a life with someone who truly cared about me, even if it meant struggling for a while.

But, I also can’t ignore the life I have with Ethan. Is it so wrong to choose comfort and security over emotional fulfillment?

1imt6wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1imt6wa/worried_my_friend_might_have_psychosis_or_a_type/,Worried my friend might have psychosis or a type of schizophrenia? Not sure if I should take action,"Hello there - I have a friend I’ve been close to since freshman year college (she is 27F now). We don’t have the type of relationship where we frequently talk, in fact I havent seen her since senior year of college because she has always preferred to be socially isolated and doesn’t like the company of others. She works remotely, only sees her family who she lives with, and I’m quite certain I’m her only consistent friend. We talk and check in sporadically, it could be anywhere from a month to almost a year where we go without talking.

The last two years I’ve noticed behaviors that have progressively worried me. I definitely thought it was a mental health issue but after talking to more of the people around me I’m starting to worry that it is something pressing she needs to look into further immediately. My concerns started when she became convinced a coworker was in love with her. This is fairly common enough, but I became alarmed because her reasonings for why he was infatuated with her simply does not make sense to the average listener. Examples include: She was certain he was stalking her old social media accounts (from when she was 13-14 years old and since has been inactive) in order to learn more about her and catch her attention. I asked her how she could possibly know this and she said he mentioned he liked a certain artists and she remembers that she had tweeted about this artists a bunch of times in her old twitter account. She was also convinced he was sending code messages to her daily to relay if he was upset/happy with her on a given day for “cheating on him” with other coworkers. Apparently their team of coworkers would often send music recommendations to each other and she was convinced the songs he recommended her had messaging for her and would spend a lot of time “dissecting his message of the day.” Everytime she would tell me how he communicated to her and the exact words he would say, I would shut her down and say idk that sounds like how a coworker/friend would normally talk to someone and it didn't sound romantic. She would say “you don’t understand because you have to be in the relationship like we are. We’re so obsessed with each other you couldn’t fathom.” So it started with little incidents like that which I just simply found a little weird, more so just thinking she was reading too much into it. Ultimately one day she is talking to him and brings up that they are dating/into each other and he relays that he has no idea what she’s talking about and he wasn’t giving her any messages. She calls me freaking out and saids this is too embarrassing and she needs to find a new job. I think thats the end of it.

Fast forward it’s been 8-9 months since we talked, I called her to check in and she has a new job now. But she tells me that she and the guy (her former coworker I was mentioning) are actually together now and that they are soulmates and obsessed with each other, “want to wear each others skin.” I was confused because this was such a turnaround from his rejection a few months ago but didn't have any reason not to believe her at this point. I asked about their relationship and that’s when I started getting concerned. She said during this almost year long relationship, they dont communicate via phone, texting, facetimes, or even seeing each other in person (they live less than an hour away from each other). They strictly talk through a google doc and that is the basis of their relationship. She said he can't see her in person because he has cancer (something she admitted he never directly said but that he had alluded to in ways only she could understand). She said she is not worried about not seeing him in person because they are already so committed to each other, in fact they are ready to get married and he already bought her a house. More red flags started appearing when I asked if she had physically seen him at all during the last year that they were dating and she said they were both at a coffee shop one time at the same time. She was in the drive thru and he was walking to his car and they did not interact. But he was there to ""send her a message"" that he was thinking of her because he knows that she goes to this location. She straight up said he walked past her car and didn't acknowledge her because thats the ""way they flirt."" It was a lot of conversations like this where I started questioning if there was actually another person on the other end of this google doc, if maybe she was misinterpreting their communication. I tried to tell her that this doesn't sound like a normal healthy relationship but she said they were soulmates and this is what worked for them.

  
A few months later, she calls me hysterically crying and freaking out. She told me her boss (the VP of her company) is stalking her and in love with her. She said this VP was interfering with her romantic relationship and her boyfriend was going to break up with her. I was very confused. She said her VP was jealous that she wasn't single and giving him attention so he tracked down her boyfriend. Mind you this VP lives on the other side of the country (we are on the west coast and he is in New York). She works at a remote company so she has only met the VP once at a company event. Apparently she is convinced the VP wanted to get her and her boyfriend to breakup so he found her boyfriend on Linkedin and sent him pornographic pictures of her. This started to just sound too far fetched for me. I asked her what proof she has and she said her boyfriends subtle mood changes came out of nowhere and it has to be because her boss was reaching out to him and threathening him. None of this made sense - how could her boss even locate who her boyfriend was?? why wouldn't her boyfriend just directly say it, why would this ever need to be in subtle code messages?? why would a boss who has everything to lose leave such an obvious trail like this (none of the interactions they had at all sounded anything more than a boss/employee relationship but she said the VP was sending code to her too). I told her if this is the case report it to HR but she said her boyfriend refused to give her the evidence and was going to fight the VP on his own. Ultimately she started having panic attacks and was terrified of her boss but also mad that he interfered with her relationship, so she started being really hostile at work to him.  She started recording her interactions with the boss, being rude towards him calls, and ultimately she got fired. I guess once I saw these behaviors start to take a serious toll on her ability to even work I realized something was really drastically wrong. I begged her to get therapy (thinking it was just a mental health crisis) but she said I'm the crazy one for not believing her. Over this last weekend, I started going through some of our old messages from back in college and I realized she has often gotten into really hostile situations with bosses, roommates, co-workers. Bridges are often burned, she is very aggressive in these interactions, and she never never thinks she's in the wrong. A lot of situations were misinterpretations on her part. There were also signs of maybe early delusional behaviors in college. Nothing at the time I would flag but now as a whole pattern of behavior I'm starting to see something was always a little off. I almost feel like I'm betraying her by exposing this to a subset of the internet but I truly don't know what to do. She has always been so stubborn and said noone can convince her she's not right about everything. It often feels like talking to a wall. Its seeming like her delusions are only romance based so I guess my question is could this be something not too serious and she just would need therapy? Could it get worse? Can schizophrenia only be limited to one delusion (someone is in love with you). Did any behaviors I mention sound like she could have schizophrenia. I'm really worried and at this point think I should at least find her parents on FB and message them about my concerns. I'm truly lost on what to do, I never imagined this could happen.

However, my laptop is also my big heavy work laptop and after Covid my hands don't have a reliable grip. They drop things, a lot. Basically I only use my laptop where I can set it up as a stationary work station, and am very careful with it and things around it (like drinks).

So I got a cheap student version Chromebook for private computing on the go where I don't have to worry as much about dropping it and breaking it, and it's not going to break the bank if I do. 

Unfortunately, it's an ARM processor (MediaTek) which means running Scirivener via the Linux runtime environment is a no-go. There's no x86 processor to mimic windows enough to run it. 

I would love to take my writing out and about on occasion (like coffee shops or parks on a nice day) and wanted to know if there was any way to work on singular chapters on my chromebook? Like, export singular chapters to google drive, work on them in google docs and then import them back into Scrivener later? 

I can always copy/paste if necessary, but that seems tedious. Figured someone might have already run into this and hopefully has a better work around than that? :)

I feel I have a really high sex drive, and pleasure myself often on my own, which I enjoy. But now I am constantly pleasuring myself after we have sex and I am sick of it.. It feels really sad actually...

We have a really good relationship. He is a sweet man, provides for me, and are open in our communication- I mean, he is learning how to be open in communicating.. 

Today after having sex this morning and he was getting up I said ""well I guess I'll pleasure myself then"", he says okay. I didn't even want to, because it just makes me feel sad. Then I ask him, ""do you remember the last time you finished me?"" He says no, I dont feel it in this moment.. I ask him why... because all he desires is a coffee and cigarette. 

I've struggled with this in the past. Where he would try to finish me after but just isn't here because he wants a cigarette. Even the ODD odd time he asks if I want to be finished, I don't feel open because he has left me hanging so many times, it just makes me feel outside of my body. 

I told him I'd like to have a conversation about this later.. I know I need to. I dont know why I am even writing this on here.. I guess just needing to get it off my chest 🙄

When we first started having sex he was always so quick to finish me. Which I don't ever experience.. so it felt like he really cared about my needs.. i was really amazed actually and appreciated that so much. 

It makes me feel like he only cares about himself, especially the days when he says all he can think about is a cigarette because he isn't here. 

We have had conversations in the past about this,  and it seemed to make a difference, for like a week.. then it went back to him finishing (sometimes 3 times) and then I am left hanging. 

*sigh*  

Edit: a part of me wants to start moving away from him before he is about to finish, saying I am desiring a drink or just don't feel it anymore.. and continue to do this, but I feel this is resentful and not a good way to deal with it.. but I am so generous to him in bed, give him like 2 hour massages and pleasure him with such presence and love.. 

Edit edit: after looking at my post history, I think to myself ""maybe I don't have such a good marriage..."". It's like when things are good I forget all the shit.. but also its in the past and I'd like to move forward and beleive we ar evolving and not just repeating ourselves.

28F
I’ve had course thick dark body hair in every area for the last 10 years or so. Shaving leaves a 5’oclock shadow and horrible razor burn so I rarely clean shave and just buzz for upkeep.

I tried sugaring for the first time, trying to get a Brazilian and my thighs. All my friends have done it and said it’s painful but you just deal with it and it’s worth it.

I will say that I was nervous both about the pain and the lady seeing me down there. And I told her that. 

She started on the bikini line and it hurt about as much as I thought it would. Then she started moving in and each pull hurt more and more. I finally started crying once she got to my first lip. She didn’t even finish the Brazilian and left me a strip because I couldn’t handle it.

I came in also wanting to do my thighs so I told her she could do it too after I had calmed down. I expected the inner thighs to hurt and they did. But honestly all of the thighs hurt just as bad. the whole treatment lasted about 40 minutes and I was physically and emotionally traumatized. It made me think maybe my body hair is just not cut out for being removed in that fashion.

I didn’t drink coffee before, drank a decent amount of water. didn’t do painkillers before though or any exfoliating/warm baths that I’ve now been advised to do.

my question is, should a sugaring experience really be that bad? Would waxing be better?

I have been doing professional laser on my armpits and although that stings I am considering my lower body being the next spot to do laser as I feel like I can handle the little stings rather than that ripping part.

1imsv8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1imsv8q/high_blood_pressure_and_serotonin_syndrome/,High blood pressure and serotonin syndrome,"Do not use DMX or coricidin HPb if you are on any pain medication. Or any medications for sleep. It will cause serotonin syndrome which excessively increases blood pressure causes agitation blurred vision sweating gastrointestinal distress. In addition to that individuals that push DMX and I think you know who you are. As well as those that push information about high blood pressure need to look at serotonin syndrome once I stop the clonidine. A blood pressure medicine believe it or not at low levels causes serotonin syndrome even when mixed with over the counter Benadryl and DMX or coricidin blood pressure medicine. My blood pressure went from 203 to 116 in the ER to normal 128/80 when I stopped clonidine it took to seven days then I still had some side effects so I cut anything else that would contribute to serotonin increase, now my blood pressure is normal. On a different blood pressure medicine that might be able to even cut that down. You see people get stuck on one thing and they get so obsessively stuck on one thing that they don't see the bigger picture. Once that happens you can't gather the other information and see the bigger picture which is why it's important to have a doctor that you can access online even if it's not your doctor that won't respond. I got three doctors opinions all had the same conclusion when I listed my symptoms and they all said that it would even out I don't know if the serotonin syndrome is evened out but I can see now I'm not sweating my GI tract isn't messed up I'm not agitated at work confused I do have. Where I can start sleeping again which has stopped for 2 months on Clonidine and clonidine does act on mu receptors which can only be reversed by narcan so therefore it's similar to a pain reliever but meant for blood pressure and poor ADHD kids I can't imagine how many kids are having these symptoms and not being able to express them to their parents because everything over the counter foods hamburgers you name it contribute to serotonin and can raise it very high. Now I'm down to 129 / 80 this morning on regular blood pressure meds and my blood pressure won't even lower when I cut the sodium out of my diet so putting a little bit of sodium back in. But please be careful of advice from others cuz you don't know when it's going to be adding to something that you're already on others don't know what you're taking they don't know your health conditions they don't know your allergies. My blood pressure was actually going up on clonidine which showed a reaction my reaction was serotonin syndrome whenever I looked at my medicines and the foods I ate and the doctors three of them separately that I asked about my symptoms. Just because it's rare doesn't mean people don't get it. Over 70,000 people have a response to clonidine because it boosts serotonin over 180% in your body. That comes from the Mayo clinic. Some people State stuff without proof I had plenty of time to study it and get proof and journal evidence if you need journals that are 57 pages put in here cuz I couldn't sleep for 6 weeks. And then when I start vomiting so bad I couldn't take it I knew something was wrong after I couldn't see you after every dose of clonidine I knew there was something wrong but nobody listened except for doctors online who took my symptoms and said guess what you're serotonin maybe too high. Listen to what other people say and then mix it in with what you know contact some kind of doctor if you got a crummy PCP like I do in a crummy PIH list what other people say but also you know your body best and somebody online may be helpful or maybe a jerk you are the one that knows your body the best. Now I can give a clear concise text right now 7 days ago I couldn't do that 

In fact the 29th of January I couldn't do that. My metabolism is a lot slower than other people's I'm older and it started slowing for some reason so my liver is being tested but for those of you that believed in me and what I was thinking God bless you and for those you that said check back and let us know you're okay thank you so much. And for those of you that bitched about the fact that I don't have any paragraphs 
  There's a paragraph I'll make a lot more but this was to make a point to someone. Who called me a jackass which was not appropriate. We don't call people names in this form we support each other because we're in chronic pain and we run into people that call us names ignore us act like we don't belong here or that we're an inconvenience to them. Oh what's worse is they don't believe us right they don't believe we're in pain they don't believe we've got something that is hurting that is truly a diagnosis. Now I'm not cutting up paragraphs just for this one to make a point to someone. The rest of you I'm truly sorry that nobody believed you I am also truly sorry that there was one person that I thought would help but then said I was grabbing for straws. The rest of you thank you for believing me my blood pressure seems to be going back to normal though it did dip a lot and we'll see what happens in the morning I am starting to sleep some thank God and thank you for your support. Today I feel better I don't know what tomorrow will be like if the blood pressure will dip or go up but I'll let you know it seems to be going good and thank you for those of you that helped those you that said you need to go to the hospital.  the hospital that did nothing . But thank you for asking if I was going to be okay and to ask me to text you back. Godspeed don't worry next paragraphs will have a lot of paragraphs. Thank you. I think everything's pretty clear on this one. And I know I wasn't drunk I don't drink and alcohol doesn't increase serotonin so this coffee. I've learned a lot about what increases serotonin having to just live on vegetables non serotonin vegetables and water. Thank you God bless you and thanks for caring for those of you that did. For those of you that didn't that's not the way you act on this form we support each other it's bad enough that we have to put up with people that don't believe us on the outside it shouldn't be that way here on the inside.

1imsu7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1imsu7v/dating_for_1_12_years_and_found_hes_been_on/,Dating for 1 1/2 Years and found he’s been on dating apps the whole time. What do I do?,"I found out the man I thought would never hurt me was indeed doing just that. On Feb 1st I decided to go through his phone. I had originally decided to go through it because he was always liking girls photos on insta and always had girls in his search bar. Little did I know I was going to find three dating apps in his non cleared apps. Hinge, Tinder, Bumble. Being we just moved in together 3 months ago I figured maybe we just hit a low spot but as I started to look through them all I found out that he had been on them our entire relationship. I went through them and didn’t seem like many of the girls were answering back so I assumed that this as far as it went. I noticed that he was on them the majority of the time when I was on trips. But what is almsot worse is he would be responding to girls after we would spend an amazing weekend together. Some of my favorite memories together, spent an entire weekend at his family’s lake house. Spent the entire Sunday getting brunch with his mom and coffees and just bonding. He left that Monday and told a tinder girl sorry he was “busy” over the weekend :/ 

When I brought it up to him he said that he just didn’t feel loved by me. I’m not sure if it is me? He did beg me to stay and said that he was sorry. And that he was just bored wasn’t sure it would work out. I asked him if we went on a date or anything and he swore he would never do that. 

A week later I found out that he had gone on date with a girl the same day I was flying into town. He told me he was busy with work and had to get up early the next day so he couldn’t hang out that night. But he indeed was on a date. He even texted me he loved me and gave a safe flight the same time he was asking her if the time still worked. 

I feel like a fool thinking he could love me and I’m considering staying. But I felt the love. He was my everything. Now he wants to try and says that he has changed and will never do that again. But I wonder how long this would have gone on if I didn’t catch him. When I try to talk to him about the going on a date he denies it and says he doesn’t remember. I’m sure he doesn’t want to admit but it hurts he lied about everything. He said he was stupid but he would never do it again. He had been cheated on pretty bad and just didn’t trust girls.

Do you think someone like this can have a realization of what they could have lost and changed? If he tells me he doesn’t want to lose me and we can work on this can we? Am I fool for thinking that he won’t cheat again. Is this as bad as I am thinking it is? 

I have been cheated on in my past relationships so it hurts I thought he was different. I told everyone I knew how proud I was to find someone like him. A good man finally but the entire time he knew deep down he was doing the same thing to me. Looked me in the face less than 12 hours after going on a date like nothing happened. 

I have been in a 4 year abusive relationship before him from 15-19 and currently 24 but I feel like maybe that has something to do with. I can be alot more shy and he likes outgoing. I have trouble bringing up what’s bothering me. For example liking girls photos it took me over a week to ask him to stop. Maybe I’m the problem.

I do love this man deep down. But does he love me now? Is it possible for us to still have a relationship or is he just lying to me and going to cheat again. I see his sweet and loving side. All our laughs and jokes. I’ve grown super close to all his friends and family. I don’t want to give up if there’s a chance things could be different.

On January 10th I was tapping to the music at a coffee shop waiting for my coffee and I felt my back let go. I’m a 28M and it was an eye opener for me. The next week was excruciatingly painful from sciatica burning my right leg. My calf hurt, the back of thigh was on fire and my butt was tender. After the pain subsided I had numbness in the outer section of my feet and my calf had no horse power to the point I couldn’t tip toe or walk on the front part of my feet. I was so scared it would be permanent. I had really depression week 2 and week 3. My girlfriend was such a blessing my life because she tried to cheer me up when I couldn’t drive, couldn’t work normally, couldn’t walk, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t sit, etc. Week 3 into week 4 I noticed improvement and today I’d say 60% of the number and 80% of the pain is gone. While I’m not 100% I’m thankful that my body is healing. I still get tingling in my calf and thigh and butt it isn’t like it was before. The pain in my thigh is 90% gone. The pain in my butt is 65% gone and it feels like my calf is getting stronger. I can sit longer now (today I worked a full day mostly sitting down with some walking breaks) I’ve also noticed that my right leg still gets tired and begins to hurt but I’m sure it’s still healing. I’m on 600 mg ibuprofen but I only take it when my leg hurts from walking or standing all day. I’m hoping to give my final update in two weeks because I’m hoping the numbness will have subsided completely but I’m praying hard. I want to thank everyone’s kind comments because I needed them badly. I’m an active person who loves driving (I drive stick), riding my motorcycle which I’m putting on hold until next month March 10th, I love working, being around the town and out and about So it was definitely a shock and it affected me so negatively. I was chained at home and I hated feeling I couldn’t be the strong one for my gf but she really helped immensely. I think it’s a success story in the making but I’m not done yet.

Marshal Claude Victor Perrin silently cursed at every misfortune thrown upon him and his Corp. The fool, that trigger-happy fool. Were it not for him, he and his men would've been out of this damned winter hell and back to France by now. But no, some fool just HAD to mess around and blow the bridge. Accident his ass, Claude knew damn well it was no accident.

""God curse him."" Claude seethed silently, taking another swig of his wine. ""May God send him to the deepest circles of hells!"" He yelled, loud enough to assuredly be heard by the guards posted outside his tent, but Claude didn't care. That was nothing compared to the situation he and his men now find themselves in.

Marshal Claude Victor Perrin and his XI Corp, stuck in Russia in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, with their only chance of escape across the river having been blown to high hell, all the while the cossacks take every opportunity they see to pick off his men. This week alone has seen fifteen of his men die to their infernal raids, with twenty more dying from the biting, infernal Russian cold.

God, he hated it here.

Claude took another swig of his wine, enjoying the taste and the tingling feeling it left afterwards.

Just then, an infantrymen opened the flap of his tent. ""Tsch, what?"" The Marshal groaned, ignoring the urgency in the soldier's face.

What he didn't ignore, though, was the panic in the soldier's voice. "" Marshal, we have a situation at the edge of camp.""

Reluctantly, Claude placed the bottle back on the table. ""Of what kind?""

..........

The throng of soldiery surrounding the wagon has the Marshal slightly ticked. Horrid situation they may be in, they still owe it to themselves as soldier's of the Grande Armee to retain a semblance of discipline dammit.

""Out of the way!"" Claude yelled, pushing through the throng of soldiery until he was able to push through the crowd.

At the very epicenter of the men's attention sat a wagon, stained with blood, the men who manned it, equally stained with blood along with the roughed up look that only battle could give.

Claude made to address one of the men who was patting a heaving sapper's back. ""Well? What happened?""

The man's eyes were wild and wide when he looked to the Marshal, as though he had gazed at the deepest pits of hell itself.

The soldier pointed back to where he and his fellows came from. ""Cossacks, sir! They- they came out of nowhere!"" He stammered. ""B-but, th-t-t-they-"" the soldier stuttered, as though the memory of his encounter was nearly incomprehensible. Claude made to rattle the man back to his senses before the fellows with him spoke up.

""Those cossacks, sir. They be dabbling with some kind of dark magic, they are!"" A Pole with a thick accent said. ""Cannibals, they hav Necromancers those cossacks are, sir!""

Claude felt a headache coming on in the wake of the Pole's mad rambling. Savages though the cossacks are, none of them would be as savage as to resort to cannibalism. And necromancy? An old wives' tale, this is not the middle ages, where religious superstition reign supreme as the fact of life. Claude made to admonish the Pole for such utter nonsense before one of his fellows piped up.

""The Pole does not lie, marshal! I've seen 'em too!"" The Bavarian declared. ""Walking corpses those cossacks command, I tell you!""

""Alright, enough, enough!"" Claude shouted, his patience for such nonsense these men before him were spouting growing ever thinner. ""Clearly, the cold has made you all delirious."" Claude stated. He then pointed towards the closest men. ""Get these men warm, some hot food too if possible.""

Marshal Claude Victor Perrin watched on as his men dragged the delirious men somewhere where they could cool their heads.

As if the cold couldn't get any worse, now, it's affecting the men's psyche! Could this day get any worse?

..........

""This is it."" Stephan declared. ""This is officially the most shittiest winter I have ever experienced.""

Micheal scoffed, amused. ""Wasn't aware you keep a list."" He said, lighting a pipe.

Stephan wrapped his greatcoat tighter around himself as a gust of cold wind blew past. ""First time was in Bavaria, when I was little."" He began. ""Nearly lost a bloody finger that's how cold it was.""

Michael raised an eyebrow, now curious. ""What about the second?""

""Eylau."" The Bavarian simply stated. 

Michael nodded in mutual understanding. Eylau had been a horrible mess and one of the coldest he had ever remembered feeling during that bloody day.

Now, it was Stephan's turn to ask; ""What's your worst winters?""

Michael shook his head. ""Not even the Russian winter could top Eylau for me."" Michael left it at that. Stephan merely nodded at the answer, it's the most he'll ever get anyway.

The pair sat in silence for awhile, sitting in their respective seats on each side of the compound entrance. Watching the vast fog that surrounded the entire compound. All the while holding onto their greatcoats tight whenever the blizzard wind picked up.

During this lull in silence, Stephan's eye caught a figure shuffling towards them. He rubbed at his eye and looked at the figure again. It was still there.

""Hey, heads up. We've got someone approaching."" Stephan warned, getting up and grabbing his musket.

Stephan stepped a few feet forward as Michael picked up his own musket. The Bavarian squinted his eyes for a better look at the figure, but the ensuing blizzard made it difficult to discern.

""Friendly?"" Michael called out.

Stephan hesitantly shook his head. ""Not sure.""

""Well, if it ain't one of ours then just turn them back."" Michael advised, sitting back down but had his musket sat neatly on his lap in case anything happens.

Cupping one hand over the side of his mouth, Stephan shouted. ""Halt!""

Wether the figure heard or not, it did not stop, it simply continued walking. Stephan shifted his musket so that both hands were gripping it, though he didn't aim at the figure just yet.

""This is a restricted area, turn around and leave!"" Stephan shouted again, more louder this time.

The figure continued on. Unheeding of the Bavarian's words.

The Bavarian raised his musket and took aim. ""Last chance! Turn around and leave, or be shot!""

Either out of stubbornness, deafness, blindness, or simply a combination of all three, the figure continued trudging on.

Clicking his tongue in annoyance, Stephan aimed down the sights, exhaling, he zeroed in directly at the figure's chest, exhaled, and fired. The report of the musket echoed across the compound and beyond. Stephan watched on as the figure staggered, took one step forward, then fell to the snow. Forever unmoving.

""Idiot."" Stephan muttered as he went back to his post, fishing out the powder from his pack as he did.

With disinterested eyes, Micheal went back to gazing at the empty fields before him-

Micheal's eyebrows rose slowly, his eyes registering the new sight before him.

""Stephan."" Micheal called out as he brought his musket to bear.

""What?"" The Bavarian asked as he grabbed the ram-rod.

The Frenchman didn't respond, cautiously, he stood, gripping his musket tight. Stephan watched this, and put two and two together. The Bavarian looked back as he finished reloading his musket, and is greeted with a sight that will haunt him for the remainder of his days.

Amidst the blizzard fog, dozens upon dozens of figures emerged. None made but a singular sound, didn't say anything nor did they move, they simply stared at him and Micheal.

And then. They began to move forward.

.........

Claude was beginning to think that Pole's ramblings wasn't so outlandish after all.

Ever since that Pole and his friends came back, Claude had starting receiving a slew of reports via a rider. Those letters, which now litter the Marshal's desk, all report attacks that might as well have come from some novel. Corpses washing ashore coming back to life and attacking the living? Constant Cossack raids followed by a horde of man-eating corpses? Each and every single one of those letters might as well be the plot of some twisted novel! And yet, here they sit, reports sent by legitimate soldiers, soldiers that he knew well would not dare to make up something as outlandish as this in their reports, even as a prank.

The Marshal sighed in frustration and took a huge gulp from the bottle of wine he had pilfered back in Moscow.

The Marshal sighed again as the wine surged through his veins. Lazily, he looked over the reports scattered at his desk, his mind swirling with thoughts. Sometime passed as the Marshal fell into this stupor, thinking, planning, calculating.

At last, Claude broke from his stupor, taking another gulp of wine, the Marshal fetched a parchment, ink and quill. Sweeping the reports aside, he placed the parchment on the table, dipped the quill in ink, and began to write.

As the sun rose behind the morning blizzard the next day. Marshal Claude oversaw the two wagon convoy, carrying with them wood, men, guns and ammunition, leave the now fortified camp and disappear into the morning blizzard. Intent on reinforcing the men encampment up the river nearby.

Marshal Claude Victor Perrin sighed as he nursed his mug of hot coffee. This is going to be a long and bloody day, Claude could feel it.

""God, I hate Russia."" The Marshal muttered. Silently vowing to never to return to this side of the continent ever again.

1imslrr,https://i.redd.it/h6ovzayuhgie1.jpeg,How can I improve on my pour over technique?,"Just got a pour over this christmas and have been trying to improve my technique since. I'm currently trying to run [James Hoffman's way to pour over.](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM?si=YY9esnzRXWvBfVjJ)

I'm using pre-grinded filter grains, but will be buying a Kingrinder or a 1Zpresso when I can decide on a ""budget"" friendly model from either of them.

I'm using a 1:16 ratio and is either brewing one or two cups. When brewing one cup i do 250ml water and 15g grains, and with two I do 450ml water with 28g grains. My v60 will only hold up to 450ml hence not using 500ml on two cups.

I have no idea what kind of kettle I'm using or how good it actually is, but have heard you can easily make do with a decent one in terms of pouring. The temperature however idk, at least it's boiling a bit, so about 100c?

The process I do is wetting the v60 with a filter in it using boiled water, draining this. Then I put my grains in and start pouring. I do 50ml and wait 10s for bloom. Then I do 50-75ml with 10s rest in cycles til I reach my desired amount. I pour in circles with a decent height and speed. Then rest a bit more, give it a swirl and drain.

The bed I'm left with is this (see pic).
Now I can tell the difference between a good and bitter coffee. And even though my pour over tastes good I'm convinced I have miles to improve upon.",1,1739256278.0,pourover,7,0.66,False

#Mission Log: Day 0025
&#x200B;

##Addendum 33
&#x200B;

Once Tianna and Stockley seem to accept my generally-benevolent intentions, helped along by Packard providing both of them with their own comfortable seats, I figure it's time to provide at least some proof of what I've been telling Packard at least about the current state of affairs in Baerston Stronghold. 
&#x200B;

“Do you expect this to take long, Joachim?” Stockley asks, the tension in his neck and the way that he has positioned his chair ever so slightly between Tianna and the main wall-screen I've been using. He gestures vaguely southward. The sun is well past noon, with about three hours to full dusk. “Were we still on the move, I suspect that Plenulru would be calling for a meal-stop around now.”
&#x200B;

“The kitchen's as fully-stocked as I can manage, under the circumstances,” I answer. “Not much variety in the drinks if you have no taste for tea, though. I've located seeds and other traces of some interesting fruit and berries, but even if I were finished analyzing them for toxins it would still take some time to produce fruit.”
&#x200B;

“That's something I've been wondering about, Joachim,” Tianna says, once Stockley hands her a flagon of water. “You have no magic, and yet you've been able to produce food with nothing resembling a farm or a work-force...”
&#x200B;

I grin at her. “Once we get past the business of explaining what's happening to the north, you're welcome to take a tour of the sub-levels, which is where I keep my farms, of a sort.” I gesture at the others, including them in the invitation. “I want to tell you as much as I can about myself, what I can offer, and what I ask in return.”
&#x200B;

Stockley's eyes narrow at that last part. “What does a spirit in a not-dungeon want from the likes of us?” he asks, trying for the Trade Tongue equivalent of a 'down-home drawl' for a lower-class education. “We're aught but simple travelers, seeking a better life elsewhere...”
&#x200B;

I chuckle at him. With a gesture, a simplified digital template of the empty frames hanging on the walls of every room pops into view. “These aren't just 'pointless decorations', Stockley. I can see and hear everything that happens in sight of these things. And when the time is right, I'll teach everyone how to communicate with each other through them, as well.”
&#x200B;

I give him and Tianna 30 seconds to think about that; as soon as they start blushing, I add a basic camera-emplacement. “I've also got these, which you may have noticed next to or above the doors. I can't talk through them, but I can see and hear through them. So it's fair to say that, barring whatever goes on in the restrooms, whatever anyone said or did once they were within about 100 paces of the main building, I know it.”
&#x200B;

Packard chuckles at them while sipping from his own flagon of tea. He shoots a mild frown down at it before looking back up at me; “Are you absolutely certain that you can't brew something a little stronger, Joachim?” he asks. “Some thirsts require more than water to slake...
&#x200B;

“Potentially, yes,” I answer. “I hosted another group of visitors before your caravan arrived, and at least some of them expressed a similar desire. So, even if I don't manage to finish building a distillery or two before they return, I suspect that they will bring supplies of something you'll find more to your taste with them.
&#x200B;

“... But that's for later,” I continue, shifting tones and topics and 'dismissing' the screen and camera-mike simulations. I indulge in a bit of theater by pulling a 'standing desk' up out of the floor on which I can rest my coffee mug, then gesture to manifest a playback-window to my left, so that it will play with the actual window on one side and myself on the other.
&#x200B;

“First, I'm going to introduce you to my first four guests: Thakibi, Sudryal, Snatdrure and Scinjir,”I say, pulling up an image-file of the four of them in their travel-gear. “Sudryal, the elven mage, is primarily responsible for teaching me Trade Tongue, though the others had their own insights to share. He claims that he, along with Snatdrure Steelmaster and Scinjir, previously resided in or near Baerston Stronghold until about six months ago. Thakibi is a ranger whom they hired to guide them south to the capitol.”
&#x200B;

Tiana arches an eyebrow. “I knew the roads weren't in the best of shape out here in the hinterlands, but I thought that at least the Hoeffschtaeders on the dawnward side would have kept them in better repair...?”
&#x200B;

I shrug. “They made references to various delays on their journey,” I say, collapsing the static image and replacing it with a video-replay window. “... Mostly in preventing the Elemental Conquestery from recapturing them.”
&#x200B;

Packard stiffens. “The... what?” he asks.
&#x200B;

“I'll let you see and hear what they told me,” I answer, and replay the interview.
&#x200B;

##Addendum 34
&#x200B;

While the three of them watch, I work on reinforcing the illusion that the avatar is sufficiently human for them to feel comfortable around by pulling a writing-desk and chair into view, and settling into place with my mug in hand. I point the avatar's face at the replay, though I dial up my facial-analysis tools onto the three humans. 
&#x200B;

Packard's eyes narrow, the focus of his eyes flicking from one point of interest to another. I give about 62.23% odds that he's been in or near Baerston Stronghold himself, given the shallow nods and other 'tells' that seem to correspond with one of my first four friends giving little details about the area that he seems to recognize.
&#x200B;

Tianna follows along, relaxing somewhat in her chair as the recording progresses. A few lines of tension in her muscles ease, replaced by others elsewhere. 
&#x200B;

Stockley stays in a seated position that I'm sure he thinks makes him look like he's falling asleep, but the position of his feet and legs make it obvious that he could bolt for the front door at the first sign of any sort of trouble.
&#x200B;

The part of the discussion explaining the rise of the Elemental Conquestery sets all three of them back in their seats, including the still-skittish Stockley. Packard's lips twitch as he manages to squelch what I can only assume are questions and comments he keeps to himself at the moment. Tianna never looks away from the screen but her hand reaches out toward Stockley. To his credit, the man notices and laces fingers with her, and the simple touch causes a reduction in heart-rate and respiration that even Packard notes, by means of a flickering glance in her direction before returning to the playback.
&#x200B;

My overall impression of how the group is taking the presentation up to this point amounts to 'credible'. Packard's got an excellent poker-face, but the other two...
&#x200B;

“That can't be right, can it...?” Stockley manages, his eyes wide and a shocked quaver in his tone. “Dungeons can't just... team up with each other like that and trap an entire town of adventurers for ten solid years, can they?”
&#x200B;

Tianna shoots him a look. “Have you gotten any letters from anyone you know living out that way recently?” she asks. “Or done business with any merchants specializing in cold-weather gear or anything else they're known for producing up in Baerston Stronghold?” She presses her lips together, but eventually her shoulders slump a bit and she gives a single, shallow nod. “I don't like that I believe it, but I also don't fancy the odds of anyone, even seasoned travelers, trying to cross the territories of as many as two whole Dungeons the size that I know those four had claimed, even back before they became this... 'Elemental Conquestery'... if those Dungeons had a mind to keep them contained.”
&#x200B;

Packard is scowling, but it's a pensive sort of scowl. The sound of his palm scraping across his stubbled chin fills the room for a moment. “I heard four testimonies that match up well enough,” he says, after a moment of that. “I'll not take it as the unvarnished truth, but I am inclined to go no further than the nearest trade outpost in the Hoeffschtaeder Barony, and shell out for whatever current reports of the Dungeons territories we can get before actually trying to make for Baerston Stronghold.”
&#x200B;

Tianna's eyes flick his way for a moment before narrowing almost enough to match his expression. Then she leans forward to press her face into her hands and rubs her forehead. “But Lord Butterball won't take the word of four commoners,” she sighs. “Bearpaw's teeth, he's still a slaver even after the Duke personally signed the warrant of exile for the entire Lignignory family-line from the Estates. The man would probably sooner miss two meals in a row before giving that up, and we all know how much he loves to eat himself into a stupor...”
&#x200B;

I raise an eyebrow, and then let my shoulders slump. “I have... one other bit of testimony that might help convince him,” I said, drawing the words out. I had already showed the clip to Kregorim with no meaningful repercussions, so why not share the testimony of two goddesses?
&#x200B;

It would mean at least revealing that I had a human soul meshed into the building, but I had to gamble that it would lead them to trust me slightly more than otherwise.
&#x200B;

“Go ahead, get up and stretch out a bit,” I advised them. “Get fresh drinks, use the lavatory, what ever you need. This next clip isn't quite as long, but it should give you a better idea of what you're dealing with, meaning both me and the Elemental Conquestery...”

1imsjvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/vitanam_initiative/comments/1imsjvd/are_we_too_brainy_for_our_own_good/,Are we too brainy for our own good?,"Good morning, happy campers. While having my morning coffee, being incredibly happy having almost broken my totally arbitrary weight goal of 76kg, which I have been aiming for since November 2024, I can tell you, I feel like the Winds of Change are living up.

So I thought to myself, what's really getting me rattled lately? It's my social media experience. In the mornings, I love to sit down for an hour and browse the socials, write a few comments, or start a new opinion piece, for I would otherwise forget that I had it at all.  Anyway...

So here I am, opening YouTube, and the first thing greeting me is an Ad. Ready to hit skip in two seconds; my finger is hovering over the area where the skip button will appear. Almost subconscious. I have been trained well.

So I thought to myself, is there anything better? YouTube Premium came to mind, but WTF, who made up their pricing model? That shit costs more for a single user than the biggest Netflix option for five people. So that's not an option, especially since many channels on YouTube have their own ads baked into their videos.Not YouTube's fault? Of course it is. They are too greedy, and when a company becomes too greedy... Welcome, you've reached the meat of the issue!

When a company becomes too greedy, we are presented with a lure that is almost irresistible. Let's outsmart them! Let's find a way to make that company give me what I want. Let's find ways to exploit it. So on the App stores I went. And multiple clients i found. Some using the api, which YouTube is combating, some use the public web, which YouTube also tries to stop. They have some new features, but are generally lacking something. There are quite a few different apps.

And there lies the problem. Our own damn intelligence and our creative drive. We are doer's. So we do. In a way, it's cute. It's also a waste beyond belief, making the whole ecosystem convoluted, expensive and even less functional.

Instead of working with the original app-designes, we try to copy, and make a better fork, instead of making the product better. Competing with a resource-heavy company for years and years, constant work, regular updates, to fix a software from a company that's getting paid for creating it. We should work with a company like that. Making it open source, for example. They can still have premium services and whatever. 

Why am I rattled? I'm seeing the same ads. Everyday. Everywhere. Um not going to buy a new car, just because i was just forced to watch a badly made 30 second ad about some car I wouldn't even consider at all. For the tenth time of the day. What The Honeycomb... It's just not working for some people. Let me disabke the damn ads. They are an insult, and nothing but a waste of my time. I've blocked entire brands for having aggressive ads. You see, any company spending that much on ads, they are ripping someone off. For sure. But even that is halfhearted, as I'm getting the same ads over and over, sometimes three times during the same video. That is insulting.

How did we arrive at a point where this is acceptable? We should be bunching together and force YouTube to change this backwards practice of shoveling forced ads into peoples faces. Let them opt in. Or at least, give the enthusiasts a way out. While it's fun and good that people get creative and write alternative apps trying to cheat their way to the perfect user experience, it's ultimately a waste of time. Community tools like YouTube should require a community version. Disable monetization for creators, disallowed commercial use, whatever. 

Treating us like automatons that will buy their stuff because they are blasting us with ads, and not stopping even if we did buy the stuff. It's ridiculous. It's like spam mail, those small cards in your car window, or unwanted solicitors. There is no effort at all. Just in your face annoyance.

And we try to be smart and hack together look-a-like apps that are almost sufficient, instead of trying to make the product better. What we are doing is to force the companies to double down on bumps and locks and barriers. Tying up resources. Again. We are very apt at wasting resources for what are ultimately just personal tantrums. Why? Because we can.

Nobody stops to ask if we should. What do you think? Should we continue to be competitive in this, trying to beat the opposition in a constant battle, or should we collaborate, and create the one perfect-for-all vision for YouTube?

Can't we get real already, after all we've done? YouTube is just a prominent example. We are tying up so many resources to patch things up that require proper fixing, it's almost a Meme. We do it everywhere. Even to ourselves. See Health and Diet.

Is that the future of humanity? I say No. Loud and clear. There are many people like me. We need to get our acts together and use our social pressure instead of our brains, to control our environment. Teach companies how to make us happy while they are getting their share as well. It can be done. Human Experience Powered Capitalism. HEP-C for short. I'd love that.

There is nothing wrong with Capitalism, as long as it is goal oriented. And the goal should be: making the best version of the product with the least amount of resources and the least impact on the environment, or even a net positive. Who says that we need to be destructive?

For the first time in human history, we have full control of our destinies. And we honor that by watching 15 minutes of badly made ads everyday, not even blinking twice at how ridiculous that is.

Seriously. Picture a family getting together to watch a movie, sitting there watching ads before it starts. Ads for things nobody in attendance has an interest in, or even the means to buy them. Ads that will pop up again and again during the movie. Its so useless that people go take a piss or get some junkfood. And we are complaining about it while we are doing it.

Is that intelligent behavior? What is going on, how are we good with that? Describe that scenes from an aliens viewpoint trying to make sense of it.

We are talking about energy crisis, job crisis, housing crisis... Which we could probably balance easily, if we weren't so darn disorganized and aimless.

What to aim for? Democracy. Inclusive democracy. For everything. And an open space for anyone who doesn't want to play that game. We need to stop force feeding others what to do and finally start to adobt a more utilitarian philosophy. Get the basics right, make them available to everyone.

We are the laughing stock of the universe. Why don't the aliens contact us? Easy. We show no sign of ambition. In fact, most ot us fear the notion of being answerable to a greater power. They see a civilization that's capable of solving every problem there is, but doesn't, out of fear, greed and more fear. Of course they stay away. If they exist.

How about making a stand? Who is with me? Let's make the next 100 years the Century of Humanity. Let us make it clear that we are not Children of the Gods anymore, but a fully fledged and realized species that's going somewhere and is actively controlling for quality.

Let us stop wasting everthing we have. Let us stop all the sociopaths out there who are trying to screw us over, instead of trying to circumvent or outsmart them. A battle of technology does not benefit our cultural development at all. It should be a collaboration. To the extreme.

No Man without a roof, food and the prospect of health. For nothing in return. That needs to be the lofty and impossible-to-reach goal. But we need to try. Time is our only competition. Or it should be.

Come to think of it, time should be our friend.

I’m a bit confused about how to streamline my purchases and receipts efficiently.

For example, when I buy a ferry ticket, I use my Yahoo account and a credit card, and the receipt is emailed to my Yahoo inbox. If I shop online, I might use my Google email and a different debit card. For everyday purchases like coffee or lunch, I use my Chase debit card. If I take a taxi, I usually pay in cash. Then, for flights or other tickets, I might use my Hotmail account and yet another card.

How can I make my life easier by organizing all these purchases—along with the receipts from retailers like coffee shops and restaurants—in one place for my accountant? I need to track expenses properly, especially for tax purposes or loan repayments.

Of course, having all receipts in one place would be ideal, but what would be even better is a system that categorizes receipts and calculates payments in different currencies (euros, GBP, and USD).

Any advice or tools that could help? Thanks in advance!

1imsa8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1imsa8u/tired_of_mils_shit_so_im_on_strike/,Tired of mil's shit so I'm on strike,"My mil is a piece of work. She's passive aggressive about everything and will blurt out hurtful things randomly. I will say, some of it is probably medically related, as my husband's family had a fire when he was a young child and she essentially died and was resuscitated, so there was lack of oxygen to her brain. But that doesn't excuse her being a bitch. Her current delight is that I've started a new job that is 5 minutes from her house. She's asked me exactly where I work a few times because she wants to just ""come by for lunch."" I've explained to her that I can't just leave my job (healthcare related) for a while to eat with her. A meal with her is 2 hours easy. She doesn't just eat and go. There's coffee, there's crazy talk about numbers and people, more coffee, etc. So I told her I can't leave a new job and she got pissy.

Her newest shtick is that she was on speaker with my husband and said (she knew I was in the room, it was a group conversation with our toddler too) that I'm a bad person because I never call her. Y'all, I don't have that kind of relationship with her. I only call my own mother once a week and my husband doesn't talk to her on the phone either. It's wacky. I've never spent time on the phone with her unless it was with my husband calling her together. It was entirely out of left field. 

So now I'm on strike and I refuse to speak with her at all. I don't talk with people who insult me like that for no reason, and especially not someone who calls me a bad person in front of my son (he said afterwards ""mommy you're not bad""). She called me 3 times on my birthday and I refused to answer. I've already blocked her on social media from before because she makes stupid comments on my photos. I' be gone totally radio silent and will continue to do so until she apologized. She's already told my husband she's upset with me, he dismissed her behavior as her being her ""crazy old self.""

The silence is delightful.",12,1739254987.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,0.94,False

1ims93h,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ims93h/ive_replaced_all_snacks_with_tea/,I've replaced all snacks with Tea.,"I used to walk into town to get a hot chocolate or bubble tea daily. I've always felt this was excessive and I felt guilty most times.

I've flipped it on it's head now. Every day I walk to the bubble tea shop, but get the most boring option they have. Plain green tea, plain black tea. If I even want it.

At the moment this only costs <£1 a day, so I don't even feel bad about the cost it's cheaper than a gym membership.

Even at home, if it's 8pm at night and I feel bored I drink a cup of a tea. I always felt guilty about caffeine, most people I know refuse to drink caffeine from tea or coffee after noon but will drink a can of coke zero any time of the day. 

I've decided to tackle one problem at at time. For now it's weight. Be stopping being guilty about 5-10 things at once and just focus on the weight. Lose it!",26,1739254865.0,loseit,5,1.0,False
1ims8g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1ims8g5/mirage/,Mirage,"The house had changed again. 

The sofa was facing the wrong way. The flower vase was gone. And there was an extra pillow on my bed. 

I didn’t know if my memory was so good I remembered minute changes like this, before and after sleeping, or if it was so bad I forgot that the sofa had always been facing the other way, the flower vase was never there, and the pillow was always here on my bed. 

I banged my head back on the headboard. I had sworn I wouldn’t fall asleep this time. That I would bust whoever was pranking me. 

Because that was all it could be, right? A prank? The world couldn’t really shift just a little bit, overnight, every night, could it?

But that’s what was happening. Every day when I woke up, things were subtly different from when I’d fallen asleep. Sometimes they were minor, like an extra pillow on my bed. Sometimes I failed a subject I thought I’d passed. 

Once I found I had adopted a dog. A few days later, she disappeared - from my life and from everyone’s memories.

I was afraid to date. Afraid to get attached. Afraid to get pregnant and have kids, just to have it all snatched away in a night.

My friends made fun of my absent-mindedness. If only they knew! If only they remembered!

But no, I was the only one cursed with remembering. 

My head hurt constantly, with the dissonance forced by the changes in my world. My brain couldn’t reconcile the day’s reality with my memories. I went to a psychiatrist once, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell them. They’d just call me crazy and lock me up. 

Somedays, I wasn’t sure if I **wasn’t** crazy.

I quit my classes. Quit my job. I refused to get out of the house for days on end. 

The world was so pointless! Why should I do anything, achieve anything, if it could just be re-written by whomever was controlling the flow of history?

Which begged the question - who was doing this? And why? What sick pleasure did they get from tormenting me?

I decided I would find them and ask. That was the least they owed me.

But how would I find them?

I couldn’t go to them. So I decided to lure them to me. I wrote a story about how the world shifts when I sleep, and posted it on the internet.

I doubt they want that going public. 

Within a few seconds, I got a comment - “Take this down.” 

I ignored it. They commented again, unafraid to talk to me publicly. After all, they could simply erase everyone’s memories tomorrow. 

It was one word. A simple word, but it sent chills down my spine.

“Okay.”

And now I wait. I have pepper spray in one hand and coffee in the other. 

Come get me.
