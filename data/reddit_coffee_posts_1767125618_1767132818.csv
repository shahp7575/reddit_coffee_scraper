Ever since I was 7 or 8, I’d see him watching porn on the computer in kids room, thinking all three of us were asleep. We lived in a tiny two-room apartment, and the computer was in our room because there was no other space. Everyone was always asleep except for me. I was terrified in the moment, and it was even scarier because I had no one to talk to. My siblings were 2-5 years younger than me, and I didn't want to traumatize them, so I had to carry it all by myself. How was I supposed to tell my mom? Grandparents? Friends? There was just no one.

Between the ages of 9 and 12, I saw clearly that he was cheating on my mom. I saw texts with other women that he didn’t even bother to hide. He would flirt with girls at coffee shops right in front of his three kids. Then there were the long “business trips” and every other cliche you can think of. He was terrible at hiding it - if he even tried at all.

When I was 12, after another one of my parents' late-night fights, I sat them both down, took their hands, and tried to explain what being a “mom and dad” actually meant. 

Both of them were terrible at communicating. My dad was incredibly avoidant and couldn't handle other people's emotions, while my mom was so emotional that she was sometimes impossible to stop.

Looking back, it’s so messed up that a child had to explain to her parents how to be parents and how to have a relationship. Like, WHAT?

In my early 20s, I caught him masturbating in the kitchen. He thought he was home alone, but I was there. I had been sleeping in the other room, and when I walked into the kitchen, I saw him naked, sprawled out on the sofa.

A few years later, he left the family while everyone was sleeping. He just grabbed a backpack and moved in with a woman who, as it turned out, already had a child with him.
He was married to my mom for 25 years. The first thing I said when they woke me up to tell me “Dad is gone” was: “Finally”. I didn't even have to think twice.

I don’t talk to him anymore, he’s basically not in my life. Still, everything I witnessed as a child deeply affected me and is still with me today - it’s the reason I’ve never been in a relationship.

When I was around 12, I made a promise to myself that I would never be in a relationship. It looks like I succeeded. That’s how much the “model” of a relationship my parents showed me scared and disgusted me.

But it wasn't just them. In the early 2000s, I didn’t see any good examples of relationships around me. It was always about violence, misery, and the idea that you just had to “put up with it”. The message was that you had to change yourself, your body, and your values just so a man would choose you. It disgusted me to see my classmates chasing boys and doing anything for their attention. The power imbalance was so obvious to me.

I’m terrified that if I get into a relationship, I’ll be destroyed. I’m afraid I’ll let a man treat me as badly as my father did. I’m afraid of being used, lied to, or even assaulted.

Once, when I was 13, I was at a birthday party for my brother’s friend. The birthday boy’s cousin was there, and he was about 7 years older than me. No matter where I went in that apartment, he would find me and try to touch me. It was uncomfortable and, again, terrifying. What hurt most was that no one noticed and no one could help. I had no one to talk to about it back then.

Because of all this, I never acted “feminine”.  I tried to make my gender as invisible as possible, hiding in a “gray zone” like a cave. I was a tomboy. Even in 5th grade, I knew that being feminine meant being ""at risk."" I thought men would notice me, objectify me, and something terrible would happen.

Now, thanks to antidepressants, working out, and just growing up, I’m changing how I see myself. I’ve started dressing differently and taking better care of myself. But the fear is still there - the fear that if I embrace my femininity, I won’t be safe anymore.

My dream is that by 2026, I can finally let go of these fears and this past. I want to be free and find true self-love. And maybe one day, I’ll be able to love someone and let them love me back.

1pzvbhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pzvbhg/an_appointment_with_mr_silvergleid/,An Appointment with Mr. Silvergleid,"In the heart of the city stands an abandoned bakery.

It is a high, sprawling complex of brick and granite, and its great smokestack still stands watch over the loading bays where fleets of gleaming trucks once began their journeys to supermarkets across New England.

Now the weeds grow long and tall across the parking lot, and the great ovens sit silent upon the darkened factory floor.  Only the former administrative wing shows signs of occasional life, having been refurbished as office space and rented out to small businesses whose clientele will not be intimidated by the great emptiness next door.

Tonight, as the clock strikes eleven, only one of these offices remains lit.   The rear window – heavily frosted, and recently installed – reveals only the vaguest of shadows to the outside world.  Behind it, a stout, graying, and exquisitely dressed gentleman hunches over a massive writing-desk that is entirely devoid of electronic devices.  The only adornment is a single faded photograph of a dark-haired lady, standing before a trellis that bursts with flowers.

The man’s muttonchop whiskers give him the appearance of a latter-day Ebenezer Scrooge, and the fabric of his suit appears both expensive and somehow oddly-cut.  His brow furrows in concentration as his pen flies over sheet after sheet of thick, cream-hued paper, filling each with flowing script that seems to crackle with urgency.

The desk drawer at his left elbow stands open, and with his left hand he places each finished page into it even as his right drops the pen and reaches for a fresh sheet.

This is my boss, Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

I state this latter fact because doing so is a duty of my employment.  I have other duties: ensuring a fresh pot of coffee on the burner, keeping the stocks of paper and pens filled to Mr. Silvergleid’s specifications, occasionally patrolling the immediate perimeter of the office to ensure that ""all is in order"" (whatever that may mean) – but the core of my mandate is quite clear.

Do not make any appointments for Mr. Silvergleid.

""That’s right, kid,"" he’d told me at the interview, as I blinked and tried to decide whether to chuckle.  ""Ten to two, every weeknight.  And you don’t let anyone past you, and you *don’t* make any appointments.  Not any.  Can you do that?""

I’d thought about it as the sun sank low over the crumbling houses across the street.  ""What if someone needs to talk to you?"" I asked at last.

Mr. Silvergleid smiled, and it did not reach his eyes.  ""They don’t.  You know anyone who’s just *gotta* jaw with a guy like me in the middle of the night?  Nah, kid, they might say they do.  But they don’t.  All you gotta do is send ‘em away so I can focus on my work.  And how are you gonna do that?  Say it for me, kid.""

I cleared my throat.  ""Um, Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Mr. Silvergleid clapped me on the shoulder, and his smile seemed more genuine now.  ""You’ll do fine, kid.  Welcome aboard.""

Now, tonight, I sit at my desk in the outer office and consider whether I truly need another cup of coffee.  On my desk sits a half-finished project for one of my architectural classes – if nothing else, the job affords me ample leisure to focus on my schoolwork.  Behind me, the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office is shut as always.  Warm golden light spills through the frosted window, and beyond I see only the vague shadow of my employer bent over his desk.

The door to the outside swings open.

This is both unexpected and largely unprecedented.  I have by now been in Mr. Silvergleid’s employment for almost three weeks, and our association has settled into a predictable routine.  I arrive shortly before ten, put on a pot of coffee, and greet Mr. Silvergleid as he bustles in and closes his office door gently behind him.  Four hours later, he emerges and hands me a crisp stack of bills as he bids me good night.

In the interim, I am free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiry suggest themselves, so long as the coffee remains hot and the stationary stacked high.

Our cozy arrangement has been interrupted only twice – once by a gentleman in a sleeveless shirt who wishes to ascertain whether this is Nasty Boy’s joint, and a second time by a dark-haired beauty whom I recognize immediately from the photograph on Mr. Silvergleid’s desk.  She offers a cheery wave and deposits on my desk a large plate covered in foil.

""Nathan, isn’t it?  So nice to meet you.  I just swung by to drop this off.  To welcome you to the firm, so to speak.""  She dimples when she smiles.

I smile back; it is good to see a friendly face, and to meet the elusive Mrs. Silvergleid in person.  She has changed little from her photo, and while younger than her husband, exudes something of the same Victorian spirit.  I carefully peel back the foil to reveal a bountiful pile of home-baked muffins dotted with chocolate chips and strawberries.

""From our house to yours,"" says Mrs. Silvergleid.  ""No, no, don’t get up.  I know how he gets about interruptions.  I just wanted to say welcome aboard.  And…"" she trails off.

""Ma’am?"" I say at last.

""And just be careful,"" she says.  ""Be *strict*.  If you ever need to talk…"" she shrugs.  ""I’ll stop by once in a while.  I know you’ll do great.""  And she is gone into the night.

I am still thinking about her words when I realize I have finished the muffins and am hungry for more.  The perils of the night shift, I suppose.

Other than these brief interludes, we have entertained no visitors.  As Mr. Silvergleid himself said, why would we?

Tonight, though, the door opens.  And a man comes in from the dark.

\_\_\_

He is tall, thin, gangly – so tall, in fact, that he has to bend his head slightly as he passes through the doorframe.  He is clad in an olive-drab greatcoat and a battered brown hat, which he removes politely as he enters.  His face somehow brings to mind both a scheming Roman senator and a plow-horse well past its prime.

He smiles at me with his mouth.  ""Mr. Silvergleid?"" he says, pointing toward the inner office, and makes as if to step past me.

I am still trying to adjust to this sudden break in my routine, but I do have the presence of mind to hold up a finger.  ""Um, your name, sir?""

He stops, shakes his head as if in self-admonition.  ""Of course.  I am deacon Keyhole.  I serve at Mr. Silvergleid’s church in a pastoral, or perhaps an administrative, capacity.  There is, I regret to say, a problem with the lights.  If I may?""  He gestures to the inner office.

To say that these remarks throw me off-balance would be putting it mildly.  Deacon Keyhole’s watery blue eyes are fixed on mine, and they belie his friendly smile.  I look away, busy myself with the papers on my desk.

""I am very sorry, sir,"" I say to one of them.  ""Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Deacon Keyhole does not answer.  And when the silence stretches too long and I look up, the office is empty.

I am seized with alarm.  The outer door remains closed; deacon Keyhole must have taken advantage of my preoccupation to sneak past me into Mr. Silvergleid’s office.  My employer will doubtless be displeased, and I will lose a job which has provided me with both quiet study time and a growing bank balance.

I lurch from my chair and rip open the inner door to Mr. Silvergleid’s sanctum, a hasty apology already forming on my lips.

Mr. Silvergleid is at his desk, writing, undisturbed.  He looks up with mild concern.  ""Everything all right, kid?""

I blink, staring at each corner of the room in turn.  ""I – uh – deacon Keyhole – ""

Mr. Silvergleid relaxes and nods, as if in perfect understanding.  ""You did great, kid.  It’s like I said.  No one needs to be in here.""

I look back into the outer office, expecting to surprise deacon Keyhole hiding behind a flowerpot or a filing-cabinet.  ""But he’s still – where’d he go?""  And I tell Mr. Silvergleid, albeit with much stammering and head-scratching, about the visitor.

Mr. Silvergleid looks me straight in the eye, man to man.  ""He’s gone, kid.  You don’t need to worry about him; he won’t be back.""  He sighs and picks up his pen.  ""Just be ready for the next one.""

I pause with my hand on the door-handle.  ""Did – does he really go to your church?""

""That guy and church don’t mix,"" says Mr. Silvergleid.  ""Keep up the good work, kid.""  And he bends over his writing-paper.

\_\_\_

I am left with several questions.

I do not, for the time being, trouble Mr. Silvergleid with them when he emerges from his office and hands me my nightly packet.  For instance, I do not ask why he employs me to turn away visitors instead of simply locking the door to keep them out.  Perhaps I do not truly want to know the answer.

And I am, of course, back at my station the following night.

I do not pretend to understand all the dynamics at play, but I do not need to.  My part is simple: make coffee, refuse appointments.  At the rates Mr. Silvergleid is paying, I can do this with pleasure.

Nothing happens that night, or the next.  I do take Mr. Silvergleid’s admonition to patrol the perimeter somewhat more seriously, and at least once an hour I step forth into the dark and pace the cracked sidewalk in front of the office.

But the tranquillity of the night is unbroken.  There is no sound but my footsteps and the wind through the tall grasses.

On Friday, Mr. Silvergleid calls me into his office.  He takes a sheaf of finished papers from his desk drawer and begins to place them into a large manila envelope.  ""Something a bit different tonight, kid,"" he says, then curses as one of the sheets goes astray and flutters to the desk in front of me.

I pick it up and hold it out to him, making an active effort to avoid reading what is written upon it; to do so would seem a violation of Mr. Silvergleid’s privacy, at a minimum.  However, my eye cannot help but catch a fragment or two as he thanks me and returns it to the stack:

*…Legionnaire’s Daughter and the Duchess are especially dangerous –*

*…guardian can ultimately can be neutralized only by –*

*…used to open directly to the Orangery, but on my most recent visit –*

Mr. Silvergleid seals the envelope and slides it across the desk to me.  ""You’re gonna take this to a guy named Saul.  Good guy, friend of mine.  Don’t give it to anyone else.  Here’s the address.""  He scribbles a few lines on an index card.  ""You shouldn’t be bothered. But if you are, meet me here.""  He scribbles on another card and passes it to me along with my night’s salary.  The stack of bills seems slightly thicker than usual.

""You can head home when it’s done.  See you Monday – and keep those cards.  We do this every week from here on out.""

I stand and put the cards in my wallet.  ""Yes, sir.  How will I know Saul?""

""He’s gonna ask you if you like steak.  You’re gonna say, only if it’s cooked right.""  He grabs his coat and hat from the coat-rack.  ""Don’t write that one down.  It’s gonna change every time.""

I think of asking why it will be necessary to use a passphrase once I know what Saul looks like.  Instead I nod and ask: ""Leaving early tonight, sir?""

He shrugs.  ""You’ll be gone.  Someone might come in.""

I follow him out into the night.  And though the breeze is warm, I feel a chill.

\_\_\_

The delivery goes without incident.  Saul, a quiet man with a firm handshake, meets me in an empty function room beneath a busy downtown hotel.  He asks after my health and slips the envelope into a secure briefcase, and within fifteen minutes I am safely home.

On Monday, the fire alarm goes off.

It is just before midnight – I have settled in with my schoolwork and a large coffee, iced in deference to the late spring heat.  Suddenly there are footsteps pounding down the stairs from the upper level, a sharp and jarring smell of smoke – and the wail of a klaxon piercing the air as a fully-clad firefighter emerges into the office.

He is a middle-aged man, red-faced and winded, with a long dark moustache and an air of brisk competence frayed by great pressure.  His eyes bulge when he sees me.  ""Buddy, you can’t – is there anyone else still in here?""  He clicks his shoulder radio, speaks into it: ""Control, suite 7 is *not* clear, I repeat, *not* clear.  I need additional hoses over here, *now*!""

His alarm is infectious.  I glance over at the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office, but it is as ever:  a vague shadow, bent over a desk.  I rise from my chair, and the firefighter is there: standing at my shoulder, urging me toward the door.  ""This place is going up, buddy,"" he shouts over the alarm.  ""Get out there and get across the street.  You ain’t got much time.  Sprinklers ain’t even working right.  Go, *go*!""

I gulp, look around the office.  ""My boss – ""

The firefighter glares at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, shakes his head.  ""You gotta be – he deaf or somethin’?""

Something tickles at the back of my mind.  ""I’ll get him,"" I shout.  ""You go on.  We’re right behind you.""

He shakes his head.  ""No time, buddy.  You got to go, *now*.  He in there?""  He points at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, steps away from me and toward the inner door.

But he does not open it.

I stand there in the smell of smoke, with the alarm-klaxon drilling into my brain, and I try to think.  I take a deep breath and look the firefighter straight in the eyes.  ""Mr. Silvergleid,"" I say,  ""is not available for appointments.""

The alarm stops.

The air is clear of smoke.

And a smile begins to spread across the firefighter’s face.  He places both of his rubber-gloved hands on my desk and leans in close.

""Do you want to see,"" he asks, ""what my eyes *really* look like?""

I do not.  And before I know it, I have stumbled away from him and out the front door.

In the parking lot, all is quiet.  There are no alarms, no smoke.  And no fire trucks, of course.  Why would there be?

My battered Dodge Charger awaits nearby.  I fumble in my pocket for the keys, still staggering backwards, expecting the firefighter to emerge any moment – to emerge and to show me his eyes.  But he does not – no one does.

And as my hand finds the keys – I realize: *Mr. Silvergleid is still in his office*.

With the firefighter.

I stop, breathing hard, and I force my body to walk back to the office.  The door hangs open.  I grip the frame hard with both hands and peer inside.

The outer office is empty.  And Mr. Silvergleid’s door is still shut.  Through the frosted window, his shadow writes on.

I collapse into my desk-chair and begin to shake.

I do not know how long I would have remained that way if left to myself, and in any case I am eventually roused by a soft voice at the door: ""Nathan?  *Nathan*!""

Mrs. Silvergleid enters, another foil-covered plate in her hands, and hastens over to my desk.  She sets the plate aside in a single practiced motion and takes my hands in hers.  ""Oh, no.  Poor Nathan.  Was it bad?""

I am still breathing hard, but her presence is calming.  I tell her, as best I can, about the firefighter.  ""I don’t – who *are* these people, ma’am?  And what do they want with your husband?""

Her eyes and voice are hard.  ""I don’t know.  Not exactly.  But I know that for two pins I’d march in there and tell him exactly what I think of him putting a young man like you in a position like this.  Better save it for breakfast, I suppose.""  She stands.  ""If you want to quit, Nathan, no one could ever blame you.  I’ll see to it that you get some money to send you on your way.  Just say the word.""

But I stand, and I meet her eyes.  ""No, ma’am.  Mr. Silvergleid’s been good to me, and it’s the right job.  I won’t let them chase me off.""

She presses her lips together.  ""Very well.  I think I’d better start coming by every night.  Just to check.""  She stops at the door and turns.  ""Be well, Nathan.  And remember – you don’t have to do this.""

""Yes, ma’am,"" I say.  But she is already gone.

\_\_\_

The next evening, there is a detour – a water main has burst, it seems, beneath one of the city’s busiest streets.  Traffic is routed several blocks to the west, and I decide to walk.  I park the Charger in front of a neon-lit Mexican restaurant, and a man steps out from beneath the awning.

""Nathan?"" he says.  ""Nathan T— ?""

I spin around.  The man is tall, thin, well-dressed.  He holds both hands up in a gesture of peace.  In one of them is a leather billfold with an ID inside.  He offers this to me with a smile.  ""I’m glad I caught you.  I was gonna come to your apartment, but this is better.  Name’s Phil.  I’m a private eye.""  I glance at the ID.  It is indeed a private investigator’s license, with Phil’s full name and photograph.  I nod, and it disappears into his pocket.  ""Let’s take a walk,"" he says.

I carry on toward the bakery, and Phil makes no objection.  ""I’ll be brief,"" he says.  ""I know you gotta work.  Let’s start with what we both know.""  He holds up a hand and starts ticking off fingers as he speaks.

""You’re a private secretary to a guy named Silvergleid.  Been in the job about a month.  Every night he writes, and last week he had you take what he’s written and deliver it to someone.""  He clears his throat.  ""Now this part we ain’t too sure about, but we think the contact is a Saul P–.  And we think you don’t know exactly what it is you been turning over to him.""

""Um, no comment,"" I say.  ""Do I need to call my lawyer or something?""

Phil chuckles.  ""I ain’t the police, son.  I got a boss, just like you.  Difference is, my boss didn’t tell me to do a bunch of stuff that’s gonna get me in trouble.""

I shake my head.  ""Trouble?  You mean Mr. Silvergleid’s in the Mafia or something?  I don’t buy it.""  I glare at Phil.  ""And he’s not available for appointments, either.""

Phil holds up both hands.  ""I ain’t asking for an appointment, son.  I know how he is about that.  And I know telling you to get me in there ain’t gonna buy me much.""  He sighs.  ""No, he ain’t Mafia.  We actually think this guy Saul is working for the Chinese Communist Party.  And that Silvergleid’s selling stuff to him.  Stuff that belongs to my employer.""

I shrugged.  ""So call the police.  Or the FBI.  Or – ""

Phil cuts me off.  ""You seen anything weird, son?  At Silvergleid’s, I mean.""

I press my lips together and walk faster.  The bakery is three blocks away.

""Sure you have.  I see it in your face.""  He matches my speed, his face hard and focused.  ""You ever wonder where Silvergleid works during the day?  Well, I’m not gonna name names, but you’d know the place.  A lot of the things they work on, a Communist spy would pay plenty for.  And one of them is a gas to give enemy soldiers violent hallucinations.  You feel me, son?""

And I do.  I do not want to, but I do.  Phil sees this in my face, too.  ""That’s right.  Just the thing to confuse the bad guys before we attack.  Or convince an innocent kid to trust a thief.""

He glances around.  ""We’re almost there now.  And I can’t be seen.  But I want you to take this.""  He shoves something into my pocket – a business card, I see briefly before it disappears.

""When you make your delivery on Friday, you call me.  I’ll have a team ready.  We’ll steam that envelope open, real careful, and we’ll copy what’s inside.  If I’m wrong, no harm no foul.  If I’m right, we’re gonna find out just exactly what the boys in Beijing have been paying Mr. Silvergleid for.""

He stops and holds up a finger.  We are close to the bakery now; it is clear he will come no further.  ""Why do you do it?  Two reasons, son.

""First, we’ll pay you for your trouble, but I don’t think that’s what matters to you.  What matters to you is doing the right thing.  Your boss tried to make you a patsy so he could sell military secrets to Communists.  You okay with that?  No, you aren’t.  So you’re gonna do the right thing.  Your boss goes away, my employers are happy, our soldiers are safe.""

He taps me on the chest.  ""Friday.  You hang onto that card.  You call me.""  He turns and is gone into the gathering dusk.

\_\_\_

Friday arrives, and I am not ready.

A powerful thunderstorm grips the city, and I awake with a pounding headache that dogs me throughout the afternoon.  Even migraine pills and strong black coffee only dull the discomfort.  I arrive at the bakery bleary-eyed and unsure of myself.

Mr. Silvergleid, for his part, seems troubled as well.  As he walks through the door, lightning cracks overhead, and he whirls with his silver-tipped cane gripped tightly in both hands.  The thunder rolls away, and he sighs and relaxes.  The smile he gives me as he makes his way to the inner office seems more forced than usual.

I pray, as I fumble with the coffee-pot, that Mrs. Silvergleid will appear, that I will find a way to confide in her and seek her advice without directly accusing her husband of being a traitor to the Republic.  But she does not, and soon enough Mr. Silvergleid’s door opens and he calls me in.

""Delivery day, kid,"" he says, stuffing papers into a new manila envelope and sealing it tight.  ""Just as well, really.  Looks like you’re not feeling it today, and I don’t blame you.  Go home after this and get some sleep.""  He hands me the envelope and my salary, but does not go to the rack for his hat and coat.  ""Saul’s gonna ask if you played baseball last week.  You’re gonna tell him yeah, but the game got rained out.  Good luck, kid.""

I nod, still unsure.  ""Yes, sir.  Are you coming?""  Despite my misgivings, the thought of him alone in the office fills me with disquiet.

He shakes his head.  ""Not just yet.  Something I gotta take care of first.""  He gives me the best grin he can, and I appreciate the effort.  ""Don’t worry about me, kid.  I been doing this a long time.  Someone shows up, I’ll send ‘em home myself.""

I smile back, and wonder if this can all truly be a cynical ploy by a thief who has subjected me to military-grade hallucinogens.  I wonder, and in response, I ask myself for the hundredth time: what is the alternative?

And I still do not know.

I drive halfway to the hotel, then pull the Charger over to the side of the road and park.  I put my head on the steering wheel, and I breathe.

Eventually, I take Phil’s business card out of my pocket and I call the number.

\_\_\_

Less than ten minutes later, a dark gray work van screeches to a stop in front of me.  On its side are emblazoned the name of a dry-cleaning company, and a picture of a cheerful rooster holding up a pair of bloomers.  The rear doors burst open, and Phil gestures furiously from within.  I emerge from the Charger, envelope in hand, and climb into the back of the van.  The doors slam shut behind me.

Three other operators are here as well, all sharply dressed, all bending over screens or other specialized equipment.  One pushes a metal cart carrying a small copier into position, and Phil takes the envelope from my hand and places it flat on the top.  He nods at me.  ""Thanks for calling, son.  I know it wasn’t easy.  But you’re doing the right thing.""

As he talks, he runs a small pen-like device over the seal of the envelope.  Steam issues forth, and in short order Phil is opening the flap and drawing out Mr. Silvergleid’s carefully-written sheets.  Phil rifles through them, whistles in satisfaction.   ""Oh, yeah.  This is the stuff all right, son.  You did real good.""

It is dim in the van, and Phil is moving the papers around as he speaks, but I try as best I can to catch a glimpse of what is written upon them.  If the pages are truly full of military secrets, I wish to see this with my own eyes, and thus convince myself that I have done right.  As before, though, I can see only fragments:

*…crystal-capped skyscraper just north of the former city center –*

*…there are always BEAUTIES in the LIGHTHOUSE –*

*…there are always SHADOWS in the CORNERS –*

*…underwater facility –*

*…former Imperial Skyway –*

*…sunken Mectunimoth –*

I can make no sense of it.  And, despite my best efforts, I am not comforted.

Phil perceives this, perhaps, for he claps me on the shoulder as his compatriot runs the sheets through the copier and returns them to the envelope.  ""It’s all right, son,"" he says.  ""It’s all right.  The hard part is over.  Here.""  He takes from his pocket a fat roll of bills, presses them into my hand.

""For your trouble.  That’s as much as Silvergleid would have paid you in six months.  And you can keep what he gave you.""  The other operator has finished re-sealing the envelope, and Phil takes it from him and returns it to me.  ""Hold up one second,"" he says, and makes a call on his smartphone.  ""Special Agent?  It’s Phil… we got it all.  I mean the *full* deck.  The boys are transmitting now… yeah.  Yeah.  I’ll ask him.  Okay.""

He looks at me.  ""Is Silvergleid still at his office?""

I gulp.  ""I think so.  He said he was staying… I don’t know how long though.""

Phil nods crisply.  ""Think you can keep him there for another thirty minutes?  The Special Agent is talking to the judge now.  As soon as he’s got the warrant in hand they’re moving in.""  He sighs and looks off into the distance.  ""I’m afraid your boss is going away for a long time, son.  This stuff…""  He shakes his head, looks at his watch.  ""It goes down at midnight.  If you can hold him there.  Tell him there was a problem with the pickup.  Tell him, uh – ""

I grip the envelope tighter and try to stand straight.  ""I’ll tell him Saul didn’t say the passphrase.""

Phil clasps my shoulder again.  ""Good.  That’s good, son.  Thank you – for everything.""  He opens the van doors.  ""Get going.  I’ll see you after.""

I run back to the Charger, start the engine, peel out into the street.  It’s ten minutes back to the bakery.  I flip a quick U-turn across the center line, ignore the outraged honking, watch from the corner of my eye as the gray van tears away from the curb.  The Charger’s engine roars as I accelerate through the sporadic late-night traffic.

I glance at the clock on the dashboard.  It’s 11:35.  If I can get to Mr. Silvergleid in time – if I can keep him there for midnight – for the appointment at midnight –

My stomach drops.  I slam on the brakes, coming to a complete stop in the middle of the still-busy thoroughfare.  A car whips around the Charger, roars past with the blast of a horn, and as I sit the full horror settles over me.

I realize, at long last and surely very belatedly, what I have done.

*I have made an appointment for Mr. Silvergleid.*

One that now takes place in less than twenty-three minutes.

My hands shake, and I will them to stop.  There is still time.  I can still fix this.

""I *must* fix this,"" I say out loud.  And I know it is true.

I put the hammer down, and the Charger leaps forward into the driving rain.

\_\_\_

I scrape and bounce into the bakery’s parking lot a bare five minutes later, screech to a halt just outside the office, and launch myself from the car.  As I scramble into the outer office I am already shouting: ""Mr. Silvergleid?  *Mr. Silvergleid!*  I’m so sorry – I made a mistake – you have to – ""

And I stop short, as Mrs. Silvergleid stares at me nonplussed from the visitor’s chair.  On my desk in front of her sits a plate of muffins.  She stands, her beautiful face creased with concern.  ""Nathan?  Whatever’s the matter?  You look like – ""

I wave my arms at her like a crazy person.  ""*I made an appointment!*""  I shout.  ""I didn’t mean – it doesn’t matter!  *We have to warn him!*""  I glance back at the outer door, expecting to see a SWAT team crashing through at any moment, but for now there is only the rain.

She breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth.  ""Okay.  It’s going to be okay, Nathan.  We’ll do it together.""  She glances at the inner door.  ""I’ll go first, all right?  He might take it better coming from me.""

This is my screw-up, and I should take the heat – but I am grateful for the support.  ""Okay,"" I say.  ""Thank you.""

""It’s my pleasure, Nathan,"" she says.  She turns, grasps the knob of the inner door, flings it open.  She strides through, and I am close behind.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" she shouts as she crosses the threshold.  ""*KEEPER OF* – oh!""

She stops, and I stop behind her.  For Mr. Silvergleid is not at his desk.

In his place sits the upper half of a department-store mannequin, clad in a fraying top-hat which superficially resembles Mr. Silvergleid’s.  The photo of Mrs. Silvergleid is gone from the desk, and in its place sits a single sheet of cream-colored paper covered in large block letters.

*YOU’RE BOTHERED*, it says.  The paper is turned so as to be easily readable by someone walking in the door as we just have.

Mrs. Silvergleid regards the scene, and she *hisses*.  She marches over and crumples the paper viciously in one hand –

And the room is filled with a sudden *BANG BANG BANG* as the rear door to the street, locked and bolted as it always is, judders in its frame against a series of brutal impacts.  With a final massive blow, the lock bursts from its moorings, and as the door swings open Phil charges through the gap.  His suit is immaculate as ever, and his eyes are blazing.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" he roars.  ""*KEEPER OF THE TUNNELS!  I OFFER THIS* – ""

He stops, stares, takes in the tableau.  His eyes fix on Mrs. Silvergleid, and in them I see only hate.  ""*You*!"" he spits.

Mrs. Silvergleid steps to the side, as if to keep both Phil and me in her field of vision, and her lip curls.  ""*You*,"" she says, and her voice drips with contempt.  Her resemblance to the kind woman who brought me muffins is growing slighter by the minute.  ""I should have *known*.  Did you really think – never mind.""  She shakes her head, smiles a poisonous smile.

""Here we stand,"" she tells Phil.  ""And here it begins.  We are *heard*.""  She raises her hand, points at the east wall.

A doorway has appeared where none was before: a battered wooden frame, yawning open to reveal a dark, cramped space filled with dusty crates.  It should not be there: behind that wall, I know, are the offices of the Vareigated Travel Agency, painted in bright appealing colors and festooned with pictures of sailboats.  What I look upon now is something else entirely.

""So we are,"" says Phil.  He drops into a fighting stance.  ""Let’s get you two acquainted.""

""Age before beauty,"" the former Mrs. Silvergleid replies.  Her hand darts into her coat pocket.

There is undoubtedly more, but I do not hear it.  I have, I think – at long last, and surely *very* belatedly – understood enough of the situation to plan and execute my next move.

It is, in brief, to step quietly back out of Mr. Silvergleid’s office and make my way to the front entrance.  As I pass through the door to the parking lot where the Charger awaits, the lights in the front office begin to flicker and dim.

I close the door behind me, and moments later I am roaring out of the parking lot.  In my hand is the second index card that Mr. Silvergleid gave me.

The one that tells me where to go when I’m bothered.

\_\_\_

Thirty minutes later, I am sitting at a secluded booth in one of the finest steakhouses in the city.  Across from me, Mr. Silvergleid sips from his wine-glass and then raises it in greeting as the maitre’d once again approaches us.

""Reginald,"" Mr. Silvergleid says.  ""Thanks again.  I’m sorry to put you to the trouble.""

Maitre’d Reginald bows and smiles slightly.  ""It is no trouble at all, Mr. Silvergleid.  Of course you must both stay with us tonight.  Charles is making up the West and South Rooms as we speak.  In the meantime, I do hope you enjoy your meal.""  He bows again and takes his leave.

Mr. Silvergleid squints at me.  ""You haven’t eaten much, kid.  You feeling all right?""  He sighs.  ""I mean, I know it’s been a day.  But you’re safe here.  And tomorrow you can go back home.  Really.""

I take a bite of steak to be polite.  It truly is excellent, and I am sorry I cannot enjoy it more.  ""I – um.""  I try to decide how best to formulate the question that has been weighing on me.  ""Am I fired, sir?""

For a moment, Mr. Silvergleid just goggles at me.  Then he throws his head back and laughs.  ""*Fired*?  Is that what’s eating you?""  He puts his glass aside and leans forward.

""You know the worst part of this gig, kid?  It’s trying to balance what I can tell people to keep them safe, and what’s gonna make them write me off as a nut.  Because if they write me off, they don’t take it serious, and someone gets hurt.""

He makes a brushing gesture.  ""You and me, we’re past all that.  You’ve seen behind the curtain, and you get it, and you *care*.  The job’s yours, kid.  To start with.  If you still want it.""

""I do, sir.""  I think for a moment.  ""Your wife was never really there, was she?""

He shakes his head.  ""My wife died fifteen years ago, kid.  I still miss her every day.""  He looks down for a moment, then brightens.  ""Listen, enough of that.  Tomorrow, we find a new office, and I tell you the score.  *All* of it.  And you decide how much you want to help.""

He beams and cuts into his steak.  ""Personally?  I’m guessing it’s gonna suit you right down to the ground.""

And do you know what, dear reader?  He is entirely right.

\_\_\_

This is, perhaps, a good time to wrap this tale up.  I am about to head out on a very special assignment for Mr. Silvergleid, and I do not yet know exactly when I will return.

In the meantime, I want to thank you for allowing me to get all of this off my chest.  It has been immensely helpful, and I want to close by recommending that you too find a trusted friend to whom you can unburden yourself.  Give that person a call, and set a time to meet and talk through whatever is ailing you.

Your call should not, however, be to Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

These are just a few examples:

I can’t do work past 20:00 (only exception is maybe if I’m studying at the coffee shop with friends, but as long as I’m at home, 20:00 is when I stop all activities and relax)

I don’t do work on Fridays, that is always an off day, no matter what

I can’t do work or stuff spontaneously as I need a clear and outlined schedule  

As you can see, a lot of it is related to time, I’m super fixated on free time and time management/scheduling so I make these rules in my head (I have no clue why), and I just can’t break these rules or structure or it’ll cause lots of stress.

I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. ",1,1767132316.0,DAE,1,1.0,False
1pzv7mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pzv7mh/my_dog_came_back_after_a_week_missing_it_wont/,My dog came back after a week missing. It won’t stop watching me sleep.,"I bought the cabin for quiet. Not the Instagram kind of quiet with a mug and a blanket. The real kind where you notice the refrigerator relay click and the way your own boots sound different on old pine boards.

Buck was part of that deal.

He’s a mutt. Forty-something pounds. One white “sock” on his front paw and a crooked ear that never decided what it wanted to be. He’s not special. He’s not trained. He’s the kind of dog who brings you a stick and then looks offended when you throw it.

He went missing for a week up there, and I did every cliché thing you do when you’re trying not to panic.

Treat bag shaking. Calling until my voice went hoarse. Walking the tree line with a headlamp and a cheap aluminum flashlight I keep in the junk drawer, the one that eats AAA batteries like it’s mad at them. I left his blanket on the porch. I left food out. I left the back door propped open with a boot the first night, like a door has ever mattered to a dog that wants to come home.

He didn’t come back.

The cabin is far enough out that you can’t just wander to a neighbor for help. There’s one guy down the service road who comes up on weekends, and I only know him because he has a boat under a tarp and he never waves first.

I asked him if he’d seen Buck.

He said no and kept looking past me at the woods, like he didn’t want to give his eyes a reason to stay.

By day seven, I was doing the thing where you get mad at the missing animal because anger feels like you still have control. I drove the Forest Service road with the windows down, stopping every half mile to call “Buck!” into the trees like an idiot, listening for tags.

No jingle. No bark. No yelp.

Just the woods being the woods.

I finally went back to town for two nights because I needed sleep and because I was burning daylight in circles and calling it a search.

On the third day, I drove back up to pack the cabin and take a break from it. I told myself I needed distance. I told myself a lot of things.

It was late afternoon when I pulled into the gravel spot. Frost still clung to the shady patches. I killed the engine, stepped out, and looked up at the porch.

Buck was sitting in front of the door.

Not lying down. Not panting. Not wagging. Just sitting, perfectly still, facing outward like a statue someone forgot to put away.

Relief didn’t hit first.

Confusion did.

Because Buck doesn’t do stillness. He sits for ten seconds, then his tail starts thumping and his body follows it, and he turns into a whole problem.

This dog did not move.

“Buddy?” I said, and my voice came out smaller than I wanted.

His head turned toward me in one slow, smooth motion. His eyes were wide, too alert, like he’d been awake for days.

I stepped onto the porch. I crouched. I held out my hand.

He didn’t lean in. He didn’t sniff like he was reading me the way dogs do. He stared at my fingers like I was demonstrating what hands are.

Then I noticed the first real wrong thing.

His collar was gone.

Not broken. Not hanging from a branch. Gone clean, like someone unclipped it and took it with them.

That made my stomach drop harder than any scratch or limp would have. If a decent person finds a dog, they call the number on the tag. They don’t strip him.

I touched his head anyway.

He flinched.

Not a snap, not a back-away. More like he wasn’t expecting contact and his body reacted a beat late.

His fur felt cold and damp in patches. His paws were weirdly clean. Not just “walked through snow” clean. Clean like he’d been on concrete.

He smelled like stagnant water. Like the inside of an old cooler that sat shut too long.

“Buck,” I said again, firmer.

He blinked once.

No tail. No whine. No happy wiggle.

After a second, he stood up and walked into the cabin without looking around, straight through the doorway, and then stopped in the middle of the living room like he didn’t know what came next.

I stood there with the door open behind me, keys still in my hand, feeling like I’d just let something in because it knew where to sit.

I did practical things because practical things feel like armor.

Water bowl. Food. Check him for injuries. Look under his belly. Check the pads of his feet. Look for burrs. Look for blood.

Nothing.

No cuts. No torn nails. No limping.

He ate, but slow. Careful. Like he was concentrating on chewing.

Between bites, his gaze snapped to the corners of the room. Not random. The same ones, in a pattern that made no sense unless he was tracking something I couldn’t see.

Corner behind the TV.

Corner by the bathroom door.

Shadow under the end table.

I put a spare collar on him, the cheap nylon one with a plastic buckle. He let me. He didn’t help. He didn’t resist. He just watched my face the whole time like he was studying what expression goes where.

That night I tried to act normal. I ate a microwaved skillet meal off a paper plate. I drank one beer too fast, a can of Coors Light I’d left in the fridge from last trip, because my hands wouldn’t stop doing that small tremor thing they do when you’re trying to pretend you’re fine.

Buck sat in the living room facing the hallway. Not sleeping. Not begging. Just watching.

When I went to bed, I left the bedroom door open like usual.

He followed me in and went to the far corner by my duffel bag.

And he sat, facing the bed.

I told myself he was anxious. That he’d been trapped somewhere. That he needed to see me. That dogs do weird things after trauma.

I turned off the lamp.

At some point I fell asleep.

Then I woke up like my body had been yanked out of it.

Not gradually. Not that normal half-awake roll. I snapped awake with my heart already going.

My phone was on the nightstand. The screen lit when I brushed it. 2:00 a.m. exactly.

Buck was still in the corner.

Sitting straight.

Staring at me like he’d been doing it for hours.

I swallowed. The sound felt loud in the quiet.

His head tilted a fraction, like he was listening to my throat.

“Buck,” I whispered.

His mouth opened slightly.

Not panting. Not relaxed.

Just open enough to show teeth.

He made a sound that wasn’t a bark.

It was wet and low, like someone pushing air through a throat that didn’t know what shape to make. It came in pulses that made my brain do the dumbest thing possible.

It tried to make it into syllables.

He stood and walked toward the bed. His steps were careful, placed, like he was thinking about where to put each paw. He stopped close enough that the stagnant-water smell hit me harder.

He made the sound again, inches from my face.

I grabbed my flashlight off the dresser and clicked it on because that’s what you do when your brain is screaming at you. Light equals control.

The beam hit his eyes.

He didn’t flinch. He didn’t squint. He didn’t do that normal pupil-tightening thing.

Maybe it was the angle. Maybe my hands were shaking and I didn’t see it right. I’m not telling you I’m a scientist in a lab. I’m telling you what it felt like in that moment, and in that moment it felt like light meant nothing to him.

“Stop,” I said, and my voice cracked. “Stop doing that.”

He turned his head toward the bedroom door like he’d heard something outside.

I listened.

Nothing. No branches. No wind. Just my breathing.

He looked back at me and sat down again in the corner, like the whole thing was done.

I didn’t sleep after that. I sat upright with the flashlight in my lap until my eyes felt gritty and my jaw hurt from clenching.

In the morning, the cabin looked normal in that cruel way daylight does. Sun through the dusty window. Stove cold. My own mess on the counter.

Buck sat by the wood stove, staring into the corner where wall met floor.

I tried to call the vet in town. No service. One bar that turned into zero as soon as I hit “call.” I walked outside to the one spot near the split pine where I sometimes get a signal, held my phone up over my head like it was 2006.

Nothing.

All day he stared into corners like he was waiting for something to move there.

That night, I told myself I needed a barrier.

Not to punish him. To get one full night where I wasn’t waking up to him watching me like a stranger.

I shut him out of the bedroom and locked the door. It’s one of those cheap twist locks, more for privacy than security. I pushed a chair against it too, which is the kind of thing you do when you know you’re being ridiculous but you do it anyway.

At first, he whined like a normal dog. That hit me right in the chest, because Buck’s whine has always been pathetic in a way that works.

I almost opened the door.

Then the whining changed.

It got higher, more controlled. Like someone aiming for “sad dog” and overshooting it.

No scratching. No paw scrapes.

Just that steady crying sound on the other side like it was being performed.

I sat on the bed staring at the door, waiting for my brain to calm down.

Then I heard something under the whining. Softer. Wet. Breath pushed close to the crack.

And I heard something that made my whole body go cold.

“Let… me… in.”

I held my breath so hard my chest started to hurt.

It came again, clearer.

“Let me in.”

I grabbed my phone and hit record. My hand shook so badly the screen blurred. I held it near the crack under the door like that would make reality show up in the audio.

Later, in daylight, the recording was just muffled whining and a couple dull bumps. No clean words. Nothing I could point at and say, hear it, I’m not imagining things.

In the moment, I heard it.

The whining stopped.

Silence.

Then the doorknob rattled.

Not a paw slipping on metal.

A rattle like something was testing it.

The knob turned down and sprang back up.

The lock held.

I didn’t move until the sun came up.

The next morning, Buck was in the living room by the window, watching the tree line like he’d been there all night. He turned his head toward me slowly.

His mouth opened slightly.

No sound.

Just that same wrong stillness.

That was the day I should have left.

Instead, I did what people do when something is wrong and they don’t want to admit it.

I tried to make it normal.

I cleaned. I kept busy. I avoided looking at him too long. I told myself I was hearing words in whining because I was tired and scared and my brain wanted a pattern.

Late afternoon, I walked into the kitchen and caught him briefly up against the wall near the cabinet, on his hind legs like he’d been reaching for something.

The moment I made a noise, he dropped down.

He looked at me like I’d interrupted him.

That night I sat on the couch with the TV on low and my phone in my hand, telling myself I’d stay awake. I told myself I’d keep him in sight. I told myself I was done being stupid.

At some point, my eyes closed anyway.

I woke to a slam that made the whole cabin shudder.

Not from outside.

From inside.

My bedroom door.

Another slam. Harder.

The wood groaned.

Then Buck screamed.

Not barking. Not yelping. A raw, dragged-out scream that didn’t sound like it belonged in a dog’s throat.

And inside it, mixed through it, my brain caught a shape that it couldn’t unhear.

“LET ME IN!”

I stood up so fast I smacked my shin on the coffee table and barely felt it. Buck wasn’t in the living room.

He wasn’t on the rug.

The screaming came again from the hall. “LET ME IN!”

The bedroom door shook like something was throwing its whole weight into it.

I ran down the hall barefoot, stupid, unarmed. My brain kept trying to hand me explanations that fit. Intruder. Bear. Anything.

The doorknob rattled.

Then it went down.

All the way down.

It lifted back up.

Then went down again.

Deliberate.

The door hit again, and this time the hinge side cracked. I heard wood split. The frame flexed.

I backed up and grabbed the first thing my hand found in the kitchen, the cast-iron skillet because it was heavy and because heavy feels like safety.

The door bulged inward.

A shape pushed through the widening crack.

At first I saw fur and my brain tried to snap it into “Buck.”

Then I saw the paw was wrong.

Longer. Toes stretched. Pads looking like skin pulled tight over a structure that didn’t match. Nails thick and dark and curved like hooks.

It hooked into the wood.

Pulled.

The door opened more, not forced open, but peeled open like the frame was soft.

And Buck stepped through.

For one heartbeat, he looked like Buck.

Brown coat. Crooked ear. That face.

Then he straightened up.

He rose onto his hind legs like a person standing.

Too tall.

The front limbs lifted and the joints bent in the wrong places. The paws split and lengthened into crude hand-shapes, fingers stretching too long, nails hardening into razor-bright claws that caught the hall light.

I know how that sounds. I know. If I was reading this, I’d be rolling my eyes at myself.

I’m telling you what was in front of me.

His head tilted.

His mouth opened too wide. The corners pulled like the skin didn’t want to go there.

And that wet forced voice sound came out again, clearer than it should have been.

“Let… me… in.”

I swung the skillet.

It leaned aside too fast, like it knew what a swing was.

The skillet hit the wall and rang through my arms.

The claws shot forward.

Not paws. Hands.

It grabbed my forearm and I felt the hooks bite and drag. Heat, then pain so sharp my vision whitened.

I screamed and yanked back, and it hauled me forward like I weighed nothing.

My heel caught the runner and I went down hard, shoulder slamming the boards.

The skillet skittered away.

It stepped closer, still on two legs. The floor creaked under it in a way Buck never did, deeper, heavier.

It reached toward my face.

I threw my legs up and kicked at its knee joint. My heel connected and it wobbled, and that wobble bought me a second.

I scrambled backward on my elbows toward the kitchen, my injured arm screaming. Blood slicked my skin and made everything feel unreal.

It caught my calf.

Claws sank in deep.

I felt something scrape hard under the skin and I made a sound I didn’t recognize as my own.

I twisted and grabbed blindly for the skillet. My fingers hit the handle and I swung backward without looking.

Metal hit something solid.

It made a noise that wasn’t pain exactly. More like irritation. Like the wrong sound coming out of the wrong throat.

The grip loosened.

I got to my feet and slammed into the front door, yanked it open, and fell out onto the porch. My palms tore on the rough boards and I didn’t care.

Cold air hit me like a slap.

Behind me, inside the cabin, it screamed again and the words inside it were clearer now, louder, angrier.

“LET ME IN!”

Like the cabin was the thing it wanted, not me.

I limped off the porch and half-fell down the steps. Gravel chewed into my palms. My sock went warm with blood.

I got to my truck and fumbled the keys so badly I dropped them twice. The interior light came on and I saw blood smeared across my forearm like I’d been painting.

I started the engine and threw it in reverse. Tires spit gravel.

As I backed out, the porch light caught movement.

It was in the doorway.

Standing there on two legs, half in shadow. Its front limbs hung in that wrong way, hands flexing, claws testing air.

It tilted its head and watched me.

Then it lifted one of those hands and tapped the door frame twice, slow.

A knock.

I didn’t hear a clean sentence over my engine. I heard a soft wet shape of sound that my brain insists it understood anyway.

Something like: “c’m… back.”

I drove until I hit pavement and my hands started cramping on the steering wheel. I kept checking the mirror like I expected to see something running behind my truck on two legs.

I ended up at a small emergency room about an hour out. Fluorescent lights. That burnt coffee smell near the waiting area. The triage nurse stuck a paper wristband on me and it pulled at my arm hair when she pressed it down.

She asked what happened.

I said, “Animal attack.”

She looked at my calf and my forearm and did not believe I was giving her the whole story, but she also didn’t push like she’d pushed before with drunks and fights. She just nodded and went to get someone.

They cleaned my arm. Stitched my calf. Wrapped both. Gave me antibiotics and a tetanus shot that made my shoulder ache for two days.

A doctor asked if it was a dog.

I said, “I don’t know.”

That’s the most honest answer I had.

The next morning, I went back with a deputy. He didn’t say much on the drive. Just kept his eyes on the road like he was hoping I’d talk myself into a normal explanation by hearing my own voice.

Daylight made the cabin look almost normal from the outside, which made me feel worse. Like the night had been a dream I was dragging into the sun.

Inside, it wasn’t a dream.

The bedroom door was splintered and half off its frame.

There were gouges in the hallway wall at shoulder height, deep raked lines like someone had dragged metal down drywall.

There was blood on the runner. Mine.

On the living room rug, near where Buck used to sleep, was Buck’s original collar with his tags still attached.

Clean.

Like it had been washed.

The deputy picked it up with two fingers and looked at me like he wanted this to fit into a report.

“Where’s the dog now?” he asked.

I stared at the open hallway and felt my stomach twist in that slow nauseous way fear has when it’s done sprinting.

“I don’t know,” I said.

That’s the truth. I never saw Buck again.

I sold the cabin a month later. Took a loss. Didn’t argue. I just wanted distance.

But distance doesn’t fix what you think it fixes.

Because now I’m in my apartment with streetlights and neighbors and traffic noise, and some nights I still wake up without knowing why.

I check my phone.

2:00 a.m.

Exactly.

And I lie there staring at the corner of my bedroom where the wall meets the floor, because I swear that corner looks darker than it should.

Sometimes I hear a soft rattle from the door handle.

Just once.

Like someone testing it.

Like something that learned how doors work is waiting for the night I forget to lock one.",3,1767132307.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Now that was on a friday i think 10th of november? But next monday i went bald idk why i was bored and tought it will grow back anyway so i sended a pic of my bald head and a joke to see how far i could go bad tendency i have im really ashamed but it may have been me bald with a random text wanna be fwb and only after i texted it i started realising how many wrong ways this could have been picked up i texted sorry shouldnt yave done that bad tendency he asked what is fwb i explained he said hahaha and to see if i was still in the safe zone i stupidly asked but if youre up for it he said what i said fuck..... and he mentioned he didnt feel comfortable and i know this is completeley on ME But afylter that i was stupidlt sending a lot of text asking if it was ok etc he said it was but i couldnt leave it so i asked multiple times which was stupid a aplogised for that and i still couldbt leave it but managed to stop texting this was 1-2 weeks after the incident iirc then i sended a message saying really sorry what happend hope u dont think differently of me and if u want to do something again sometime just let me know if not its totally fine He didnt read it so me and my stupid ass resend it multiple times and delete the old ones

Now people reading trust me i meant this as a joke im not stupid enough to ruin a possible friendship over wanna being fwb which i didnt want to but ad seen before im not that stupid but quite stupid

Anyway he was only on the location there on wendsday 12-15 and he didnt always shoe up since he found it difficult first week didnt show 2nd week didnt show vut the councelor did come to me and said he told me you made a jokr that didnt land good burlt he wasnt feeling great and might have been fine with otherwise And he said if i could tell you (me) that he really likrd thr contact here at the place but that outsidr of herr is too much rn

Later that day home i semt the councelor if he could say back i totally understand and if he wanted to do anything ever again he could jus text and if not also fine he said the first part to him but said that i should text the 2nd part myself So i texted it he didnt read it after a week and i jist deleted thr chat history and let it be now i havent seen him since 10th of november nor will since he turned 18 this december and once ur 18 u need to go so that was it but i sometimes still think was it my fault or was that geniunly too much for him like mentally etc

And i just think about it sometimes and think fuck wad it my fault or no But on the other hand im only 16 people come and go And ik the part above all mistakes were MY mistakes no need to mention that

Now that turned out longer then i expected so sorry for that but i dont think thats a major cause for how im feeling but i just wanted it to be added maybe just a star in the unicersenof how im feeling

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

1pzv4fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1pzv4fv/feeling_of_indifference_does_this_go_away/,Feeling of indifference.. does this go away?,"My husband last cheated 2 months ago. But he’s been cheating for most of our relationship (14yrs) usually he blames me. My weight my attitude our relationship being lonely ect ect ect. It’s always me or the relationship. This time it was bc he wanted something different. Usually I feel like okay if I just change he’ll stop. (I know it’s silly. ) but this time I realized this is who he is.

I asked him if he wanted to divorce. He said no. I asked him if he wanted to open our marriage up. He said no. He swore he’d never do it again. He’d change. This was two months ago and so far he has changed no more drinking (alcoholic) and no more sneaking around. I’m having such a hard time moving on. I’ve forgiven him. I’ve told him. I don’t want to be married to someone who cheats or an alcoholic anymore. And that’s okay if that’s who he is. I’m not expecting him to change for me. But we should divorce if that’s what he wants.

This bothers him. Bc I have no emotion behind the words . He’s used to me being mad and blowing up. Sometimes I’ll question him. And he’ll ask what I need if I want his phone or something. And I’ll just reply no but thank you. And it bothers him . And it bothers me too. Bc honestly how do I not care anymore? How do we move forward if I don’t even care if he’s lying or cheating? It all bothers him so much. The way I’ve stopped asking for help or things from him. He asks me every night why don’t you ask me to put your watch on the charger anymore? Bc it’s on his side of the bed. Or why I don’t ask him to do something instead I’ll grab a step ladder . He’s a foot taller than me. And I’ve always teased him that I didn’t know what I’d do without him i wouldn’t be able to reach anything. The way I avoid him. He’ll try to buy me stuff or ask me if I want something but I just don’t want anything from him anymore. And I realize that hurts him. Bc I’ll say no I don’t want a coffee and then go by myself and grab a coffee. And I don’t honestly mean to.

I want to so bad to just move forward. I’ve forgiven him and I don’t hate him. But how in the world do we get back to normal? I don’t want to feel indifferent towards him. Does this mean it’s over? Does it just take time? I would love to hate him be resentful anything . Some kind of emotion but I don’t feel anything anymore. We have 5 kids together so ofc I would love to stay married and be a happy family but outside of that I don’t see why we’re together. I just have this feeling that he’s just not a good person and he’ll never change even though he has changed and has been a good person the last two months.

So here we go i will just start and try to griup things together

So im 16m no school and i go to a place to get a rythm and eventually go back to school or work im there on monday and friday from 9-12 and wednsday 9-15 i and i have meds citalopram iirc been on them for idk more then a year i gues

Now there was also this trans guy 17 which came in after summer vacation and we had a nice click and he asked if i maybe wanted to do something irl i said sure and we did we were at my place from 1pm till 11pm mentioned to me he mentionef if you want we could do something tommorow got fries watched a movie talked scrolled weird fetish sub reddits we could talk about EVERYTHING if u catch my drift Next day i asked him around 2pm i fell asleep had a missed deleted messagr when i wokr up at 6pm i sended ? He said he was out with his sister

Now that was on a friday i think 10th of november? But next monday i went bald idk why i was bored and tought it will grow back anyway so i sended a pic of my bald head and a joke to see how far i could go bad tendency i have im really ashamed but it may have been me bald with a random text wanna be fwb and only after i texted it i started realising how many wrong ways this could have been picked up i texted sorry shouldnt yave done that bad tendency he asked what is fwb i explained he said hahaha and to see if i was still in the safe zone i stupidly asked but if youre up for it he said what i said fuck..... and he mentioned he didnt feel comfortable and i know this is completeley on ME But afylter that i was stupidlt sending a lot of text asking if it was ok etc he said it was but i couldnt leave it so i asked multiple times which was stupid a aplogised for that and i still couldbt leave it but managed to stop texting this was 1-2 weeks after the incident iirc then i sended a message saying really sorry what happend hope u dont think differently of me and if u want to do something again sometime just let me know if not its totally fine He didnt read it so me and my stupid ass resend it multiple times and delete the old ones

Now people reading trust me i meant this as a joke im not stupid enough to ruin a possible friendship over wanna being fwb which i didnt want to but ad seen before im not that stupid but quite stupid

Anyway he was only on the location there on wendsday 12-15 and he didnt always shoe up since he found it difficult first week didnt show 2nd week didnt show vut the councelor did come to me and said he told me you made a jokr that didnt land good burlt he wasnt feeling great and might have been fine with otherwise And he said if i could tell you (me) that he really likrd thr contact here at the place but that outsidr of herr is too much rn

Later that day home i semt the councelor if he could say back i totally understand and if he wanted to do anything ever again he could jus text and if not also fine he said the first part to him but said that i should text the 2nd part myself So i texted it he didnt read it after a week and i jist deleted thr chat history and let it be now i havent seen him since 10th of november nor will since he turned 18 this december and once ur 18 u need to go so that was it but i sometimes still think was it my fault or was that geniunly too much for him like mentally etc

And i just think about it sometimes and think fuck wad it my fault or no But on the other hand im only 16 people come and go And ik the part above all mistakes were MY mistakes no need to mention that

Now that turned out longer then i expected so sorry for that but i dont think thats a major cause for how im feeling but i just wanted it to be added maybe just a star in the unicersenof how im feeling

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And 2 more things I feel like im not allowed to feel better like when i feel a tad bit better and then gets worse again i feel like im not allowed to feel beter And talked with the councelor about this she said sje knows what i mean she has had a depression and burnout a few years back and she siad maybe thats because this is ur new normal now or feels like my new normal

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

and at the location i go to there is a girl 16 i mean were fine with each other play some pool usually etc but she goes out gets drunk etc and im like damn id like to expiernce it but i cant so to speak for lack of a better word

1pzv1o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pzv1o8/i_love_my_fil_but_talking_to_him_is_exhausting/,"I love my FIL, but talking to him is exhausting.","
Tl;dr: These are a bunch of examples of the bizarre ways my FIL's brain works. If you don't want to read the whole thing, just pick a paragraph at random. 

My father in law just visited for a week. He has a little bit of dementia and a lot of ADD. He is a kind person, and we have always gotten along well. He just makes terrible decisions and fails to understand basic concepts. 

I want to be clear when I say ""a little bit of dementia"" that I'm not talking about some senile old man who doesn't know up from down. He lives independently, drives a car, and is too competent to be put in an assisted living facility against his will. He was diagnosed with mild cognitive decline a few years ago. He has always been a quirky person, so it's hard to tell where the dementia begins and the ADD ends. Even my wife can't always tell whether a strange behavior is new or not.  

Talking to him can feel like talking to an AI chatbot. He ignores half of what I say, and then responds to the keywords that were important to him. He references things that are completely unfamiliar to me as if they were shared knowledge. 

He has made multiple comments about my infant son (his only grandchild) being spoiled. None of these would be a big deal on its own, but the combination of all of them is extremely annoying. In texts with my wife, FIL has referred to our baby as ""the pampered prince."" When I picked up the baby to get him to stop crying, FIL said ""He knows how to get what he wants out of you."" When my wife explained that she had put a humidifier in the baby's room because he had a stuffy nose, FIL responded ""I remember hating it when people doted on me like that."" My son is 10 months old. 

Toward the end of the visit, FIL saw me playing with my son, and said ""You know what: I envy you."" His tone indicated that he was surprised to feel this way. ""I thought it was going to be all work, but your baby is really fun."" I responded politely by thanking him and agreeing that my baby is delightful. What I wanted to say was ""No shit, Sherlock. Everybody envies me! I have a 10-month-old baby, who is an absolute joy. We're not teen parents. We're a married couple in our thirties with jobs and a house. Having a baby was very much part of the plan. We are living the dream."" 

In December, he told my wife multiple times that he was sad to miss Christmas with his brothers and their families. My wife talks to her cousins, aunts, and uncles, and she knows that none of them have seen him since last Christmas. He is retired, and they all live within 50 miles of him. He can see them whenever he wants. Instead, he just complains about missing them to spend Christmas with his only grandchild.


My MIL died around the time my wife started college almost 20 years ago, and I don't understand how this man has survived on his own for that long. The past few years, my wife has been reminding him every fall to get his furnace serviced. She texts him reminders almost every week, and offers to call the technician and schedule it for him. He just says that he'll get around to it, but he's too busy, and he gets upset that she keeps harping on it. He is retired, and I don't think there is anything more important he could be doing with his time than having that furnace serviced. A few years ago, the furnace broke in the middle of winter, filling the house with carbon monoxide. He had to spend a week at his (then) girlfriend's house, while he waited for it to be repaired. If he doesn't get it serviced every year, it's just a matter of time before it kills him. 

Part of what upsets me is seeing the similarities between him and me. He and I both have a lot of anxiety, and we both procrastinate. For over a year, the concrete steps in front of his house were crumbling, and looked like a huge safety hazard. My wife offered to pay and schedule a mason to come and fix them, but he refused. I think he wanted to rebuild the steps himself, but it was unclear how long that would take. When we pointed out how dangerous they were, he said ""Oh, I know! I've died a thousand deaths thinking about those steps."" My wife tried to explain that being anxious about it doesn't help anybody. Eventually his very kind next-door neighbor fixed the steps for free. 

His laundry tub (a fixture that's necessary for using the washing machine) broke beyond repair, so he started taking his dirty clothes to the laundromat and then taking the wet clothes home to dry them. My wife offered to hire a plumber to replace the tub, but he refused. He says that it's a good tub (it's not), and it's original to the house, so he doesn't want to get rid of it. This happened 17 years ago, and he still refuses to let anyone fix it.

He has a bunch of vague plans for the future that he will never actually put into place. He always talks about how he's almost done working on his yard, but we have no idea what his plan is. Multiple times in the past year, he has told us he would visit us as soon as he finishes working on the yard. It's like talking to a child who is building a fort; there is an image in his head for some future finished product, but he can't articulate what it looks like, and he doesn't have the skills to create it. Every year, he says that next year, he is going to host the extended family for Christmas, and my wife and I just smile and nod. In the years that he has been talking about this, he has neither acquired a couch, nor made space for a couch amongst the boxes in his living room. 

He is always busy with something, but we can never understand what it is. It seems like the busiest people in the world are retired boomer men. In 2020 or 2021, he told us that his friends had invited him to play fantasy baseball, but he said that he didn't have the time. He loves sports and the internet. It seemed like a great way to connect with people while we were all avoiding physical contact. 

He is diabetic, but he eats like someone who doesn't know the meaning of the word. A few years ago, when he was recovering from open-heart surgery, my wife spent a few months living with him to help him recover. During that time, she bought groceries, cooked for him, and tried to teach him some healthy dietary habits. After she moved out, she completely stopped policing his diet. He lives 500 miles away from us, so what he eats is beyond our control, and there is nothing to be gained by nagging him. Instead, we just watch him eat cookies and candy, while my wife gently pushes back on his claims that he doesn't have a sweet tooth.

In general, I don’t think anybody has an obligation to maximize their life expectancy. If you’re an adult who values soda over longevity, it’s your body and your choice. However, if my FIL wanted to die, he should have done that instead of having heart surgery. He should have told my wife how little he values his life before she put her own life on hold to nurse him back to health for three months. 

Every time he visits us, my wife pleads with him to take a plane, and offers to pay for his flight. When that doesn't work, she asks him to stop at a motel halfway through, but he always does the 500-mile drive in a single day. The last two times he's visited, he left his house around 6pm and drove through the night. He didn't have anything important to do earlier in the day; he was just too tired to leave in the morning. 

He is a hoarder, and he acts like it's a normal hobby. He ascribes sentimental value to every object that comes into his possession. He has been complaining for years about a coffee mug that he thinks somebody stole from him. The mug commmemorates a forklift training class that he did not attend. He explained to us ""A friend of mine gave that to me on the day that he retired, and then he died a few years later."" It took me a few minutes to realize that nobody gives out gifts on their retirement day. This guy had a mug at his desk that he didn't feel like taking home, so he gave it to FIL, who treated it like a treasure. 

I would never judge somebody for collecting photos, but FIL has found the absolute worst way to do that. He has boxes and boxes of photos in frames. If he's not going to put them on the walls, I wish he would just throw out the frames. If he just left them loose in a box, guests would gladly flip through them, but the frames add a level of complication that nobody wants to deal with. 

He has a collection of thousands of vinyl records. I suspect that they range in value from $0 to $100. He talks about them like they are my wife's inheritance. There is a somewhat real chance that the collection is worth over $100,000, but there is a much much larger chance that the collection is worth under $1,000. Nobody knows more about this collection than FIL, so he is in a unique position to be able to get the maximum amount of money for it. 

My wife has tried gently explaining to him that when he dies we are donating all of those records to a second-hand store.  It's hard to communicate that concept. He doesn't pick up on subtlety at all, but it's also hard to talk about death with a man who refuses to acknowledge that he will ever die. 

When my wife was a child, and MIL talked about getting life insurance, FIL's response was ""No, I'm not going to die."" When he was recovering from heart surgery at 65, he said to my wife ""I wonder if I'll live to be 100."" She responded ""Daddy, I'm focused on getting you to 70.""

1pzv1nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1pzv1nf/every_fake_name_i_used_at_the_coffee_shop_in_2025/,Every fake name I used at the coffee shop in 2025,"Kia ora all,

In 2025 I started going to a coffee shop where you type your name into the ordering screen and then they call for you when your drink is ready, which is unusual in New Zealand in my experience. As a way of feeling a little more confident in myself and in testing out some of the names that I like and think should be used more often, I decided to use fake names from May onwards. I kept all the receipts (the actual paper receipts, they're all in a pile on my bookshelf) and I am here to share the list with you! I would have done the normal ""babies I met this year"" list instead but there's only one (Arabella) and that isn't much of a post.

There are 25 in total - some that I like, some that others asked me to use, some that I was just curious to see how they'd pronounce, etc. This started out as a structured and logical post and has become a ramble about what I like and why and also some national name rankings for some reason... oh well, onwards.

# 1. Clement

**NZ:** peaked at #92 in 1903, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #266 in 1912, currently #2260

I like this one! I like names that people know but don't hear often and I think the pronunciation is pretty intuitive. Clementine seems to be a favourite here but I don't see Clement mentioned as often. They pronounced it correctly and I didn't feel completely stupid using it, which I can't say for a few names later on. Would consider

# 2. Marcel

**NZ:** peaked at #204 in 1971, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #500 in 1925, currently #751

They said it the way you'd say it, it's a hard one to get wrong. There's a lot of Marcels for me - Proust, Bezençon, Sabitzer. I don't know that much about any of them but the names always stood out. Apparently it's also a shell with shoes on. Who knew?

# 3. Vincent

**NZ:** peaked at #60 in 1988, currently #173

**US:** peaked at #57 in 1966, currently #111

The idea of a baby called Vincent was funny to me for whatever reason. It's less funny to me now, I think it's a sweet name. They said Vin to rhyme with gin, as you'd expect

# 4. Boniface

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** never in top 1000, currently #12550

The new Pope had just been elected. A friend, looking through the list of papal names, thought it was funny and said I had to use it. The young man who called out my order was visibly uncomfortable, pronouncing it as ""bony face"" and then asking for clarification when I went to get it. I don't blame him

# 5. Pascal

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** peaked at #822 in 1910, currently #2773

Pascal is the right amount of European for me, and the people that come to mind first - Gross, Wehrlein, Blaise Pascal - are all from the continent. Unfortunately, New Zealanders, including the barista here, pronounce this one with a bit more rounding at the end than I'd like, almost closer to pas-SCOWL. Shame

# 6. Florian

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** peaked at #525 in 1917, currently #3230

Another name that I'm mostly familiar with because of football. Florence is in and Flora isn't bad, why not Florian? In my head FLORI should be LORRY with an extra F, and the girl in this instance rhymed it with FLOOR. I'm sure a lot of people have strong feelings on what exactly is correct in various countries

# 7. Otto

**NZ:** peaked at/currently #118 in 2024

**US:** peaked at #63 in 1880, currently #274

I'm a big fan of a lot of -o names, including one that's coming later in this list and a couple that I haven't had the opportunity to test yet. The main point of this was to see if they'd pronounce it with a T or a D sound in the middle, but I forgot to pay attention when they said it so I guess I'll never know. But I like the name

# 8. Russell

**NZ:** peaked at #32 in 1947, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #48 in 1904, currently #367

The first of a few family names on the list. Sound and feel is pretty different to most of everything else I like, and it's one of the only names on this list with much usage as a surname. But I've always been drawn to it and would absolutely consider using it. Hard to pronounce wrong but they still stressed the final consonant, oddly

# 9. Declan

**NZ:** peaked at #82 in 2013, currently #281

**US:** peaked at #95 in 2019, currently #131

Another name taken from family. Recently had a bit of a moment both in the United States and here, although it seems to be on the way down in both countries. I do like the look of names that don't repeat letters, even if a lot of my favourites don't meet that criterion. I think I could be a Declan pretty easily

# 10. Leif

**NZ:** peaked at #294 in 1981, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #637 in 1979, currently #924

In all of my encounters with this name, it has been pronounced with the vowel in FACE. Barista, without any hesitation, pronounced it as LEAF. I am genuinely curious as to how many people have met someone with this name or seen it in literature, and how many people would think to pronounce it each way. I have a general disinterest in one-syllable names but this is one of my favourites

# 11. Quentin

**NZ:** peaked at #85 in 1977, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #220 in 1918, currently #787

After the great Quentin Blake, of course. Probably my favourite name on the list at the moment, although currently lower ranked than it has been since 1941. I think of a wise old man but with the shape of that popularity graph I don't know how many people think of a man in his 30s, or Tarantino

# 12. Clyde

**NZ:** peaked at #132 in 1921, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #50 in 1883, currently #727

I've seen this one more often here than I would have expected for a name at #727, but again it's a pretty good old man name. For me it's Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. I love love love the Cl-/Kl- sound at the start and I think it's an adorable name but my partner hates it so I will never ever get to use it so now you have to

# 13. Hugo

**NZ:** peaked at #23 in 2023, currently #25

**US:** peaked at #259 in 1890, currently #403

Hugo had never been ranked in New Zealand until 1992, and it's now on a run of thirteen consecutive years in the top 100. It doesn't seem to be rising in the same way in the United States, even long-term, but I have my eye on it as one to watch. I had a little friend called Hugo when I was younger and we used to play catch in the street, so I'll always be fond of it

# 14. Leslie

**NZ:** peaked at #9 in 1913, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #81 in 1895, currently #3016

In the United States, this became more popular for newborn girls than boys in 1946, and to this day Leslie is a top 1000 name for that birth sex. In New Zealand, the variant spelling of Lesley became more common for girls, and there's no evidence of more female than male Leslies being born in any year here. Probably the name I'd pick if I was having a baby and was told I had to pick a name before I found out the gender

# 15. Ulysses

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** peaked at #269 in 1895, currently #1291

As I wrote about in [a post earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1mlioms/where_are_all_the_u_names/), no male name beginning with U has ever ranked in New Zealand, making it the only gender/letter combination never to appear on the list. I felt obligated to try one out, and I'm too obviously Anglo to pull off Usman, so Ulysses it was. It was pronounced somewhat unlike how I'd expected - YOO-liss-siz. I'll Grant them they probably weren't expecting it

# 16. Maurice

**NZ:** peaked at #19 in 1931, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #94 in 1914, currently #928

In New Zealand, this is most commonly pronounced identically to Morris or rhyming with Horace or Doris. In the United States, I understand this is sometimes pronounced with the final syllable, stressed, as Reece. Surprisingly to me, the young gentleman said it with the American pronunciation. I like it either way

# 17. Cyril

**NZ:** peaked at #29 most recently in 1910, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #261 in 1902, currently #2997

A post on this subreddit asked if people would be able to pronounce it correctly, or something along those lines. I have liked the name for a while so I thought it was necessary to try it out. I got SEE-AIE-rill as a response. Sigh

# 18. Rasmus

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** never in top 1000, currently #5380

Felt I had run out of names so I asked my partner for one and she, for reasons unknown to both myself and presumably her, decided Rasmus was the next one to use. I have never known a Rasmus in my life. The same young man who had previously served me a few times called it out (RAZZ-mus, we're not European enough for RAAS-mus) and looked at me somewhat oddly, which was the first and so far only indication that they might have worked out what I have been up to

# 19. Peter

**NZ:** peaked at #1 most recently in 1959, currently #201

**US:** peaked at #31 in 1880, currently #192

Probably the most timeless name on the list. How many great Peters has New Zealand produced? Olympic triple gold medalist Peter Snell, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and America's Cup winner and national hero Peter Blake are but three of a long list. The few Peters I've known have been kind enough in situations that they haven't needed to be. Definitely one of my favourite classic options

# 20. Wilbur

**NZ:** peaked at #375 in 2023, currently #488

**US:** peaked at #91 in 1913, currently #2986

Probably one of the less popular options on this subreddit due to the association with the pig from Charlotte's Web. I feel obligated to mention that he is a pretty cool pig and if you don't love that then there's Wilbur Wright, the better-named of the two inventors of the plane. It seems a few New Zealanders have the same idea as me, with the name ranking for the first time here in 2018

# 21. Casper

**NZ:** peaked at #342 in 2021, currently unranked

**US:** peaked at #332 in 1889, currently #878

From Wilbur we move directly to another fictional character, although Casper the Friendly Ghost had a somewhat sadder tale than his porcine counterpart. Casper is also gaining favour in New Zealand, ranked for the first time in 2019, and the United States, entering the top 1000 for the first time since the 1930s. It's my favourite of the Cas- names, and one that's got a good chance of continuing to grow more popular in the coming years. That said, I might feel a little unkind bestowing it upon, in all likelihood, an extremely pale child

# 22. Gustave

**NZ:** never ranked

**US:** peaked at #217 most recently in 1885, currently #6258

A lot of these names are plucked from certain historical figures and this is no different. Maybe naively I expected Gustave Eiffel would be enough to drag it above 14 babies in the United States in a year, especially given it has risen from outside the top 500 into the top 150 in two decades in France. But evidently it is still unfamiliar to many, including the coffee shop barista who looked uncertain in pronouncing it ""Gus stave""

# 23. August

**NZ:** peaked at #115 in 2022, currently #126

**US:** peaked at #74 most recently in 1882, currently #88

Couldn't close the year out without one of the r/namenerds favourites, and a more usual way to get to Gus than Gustave. That first vowel in August doesn't seem to be used in a lot of names - here it's the vowel from THOUGHT and there's nothing else on my list with that vowel stressed. It doesn't really meet that many of my criteria but I feel myself drawn to it anyway, as do many of you!

# 24. Lewis

**NZ:** peaked at #73 in 1905, currently #186

**US:** peaked at #30 in 1880, currently #433

One of the bubbling-under classics of New Zealand naming history, Lewis has barely ever been in the top 100 or off the longlist since the 1940s. In the United States I understand Lewis is a less common spelling variant of Louis, but most New Zealanders pronounce the two names differently. Feels very British to me with Lewis Hamilton and Lewis Carroll (and perhaps C. S. Lewis). Another classic favourite

# 25. Victor

**NZ:** peaked at #38 in 1902, currently #251

**US:** peaked at #63 in 1918, currently #214

Somewhat surprised to see the name ranked so highly in New Zealand as I've never known or heard of one here, aside from the wonderfully alliterative Victor Vito. Victor had notable bumps upwards in both countries following both World Wars. I'm not sure what the corresponding victory of our time is, but I think it's a classy name. My association is Victor Hugo first and foremost

\---

And that is the list! I don't any longer have to go to the part of the town that this particular coffee shop is in, but on the off-chance that I find another one with this name mechanic that is good enough for me to go back regularly, then I will continue to do this. What do you like? What don't you like? What should I use? Is this insane?

At one point, a man tries to rob him, and he shoots the intruder dead. He then calls the corpse collectors, I remember there were two of them, and one of them began to ask for more details but was immediately shut down by the other.

1pzuxqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1pzuxqk/wip3800_words_a_memory_of_us/,(WIP[3800] words) A memory of us,"The clouds seemed to play tag in front of the sun, drifting in and out until the light dimmed. A single drop of rain hit my forehead, followed quickly by another, then many more. 

 People started rushing to the shelter almost immediately, scattering in every direction and leaving me alone beneath the open sky. 

I didn’t mind. The rain felt calm, steady, like it was rinsing something heavy out of my chest. I barely noticed the chill creeping in; I almost never got sick anyway, unlike my brother or half the kids at school. I tipped my head back, letting the rain soak through my hair. 

I was still enjoying it when a hand closed around my arm, firm, and unfamiliar. 

“Hey,” I snapped, startled and annoyed as I tried to pull free. “What do you think you’re doing?”  

Allen. 

We went to the same school. We used to be close — close enough that people expected to see us together — but somewhere along the way, we drifted. By the end of spring, he’d found a new group. Now, we barely spoke beyond the occasional glance in the hallway  

“Let go,” I said, sharper this time. This was supposed to be my moment. Just me and the rain 

“I’m saving your life, Ellie,” he said. “You can’t stay out here like this.” 

I scoffed. Who did he think he was?  

“I never asked for your help Allen” I sighed “and besides I hardly catch colds, so you can go and worry about Diana or Laura, or any other group you hang out with these days.”  

He sighed but didn’t argue, only gesturing toward the nearest shelter — the bus stop beside my house. 

The moment we reached it, I yanked my arm free and bolted inside, slamming the door behind me and leaving him out in the cold. I didn’t feel bad. If anything, it felt deserved. 

The noise brought chaos with it. 

“I dun wanna eat my vwegtables!” Eric wailed, face streaked with tears and crumbs. 

“Eric honey” my mom said sounding stressed “we’ve talked about this---”  

“I dun wanna” Eric wailed.  

My mom turned to me, rubbing her temple. “Ellie. Do something.”  

“What exactly do you expect me to do?”  

“Anything or else” she said giving me a death glare and leaving the room. 

“Okay Eric, let's make a deal”   

He only cried louder.  

“If you eat your vegetables,” I said, raising my voice over his, “I’ll call Mrs. Winters and ask if Andy and Anna can come over.” 

 I hoped for the best. 

Andy and Anna, the twins from two houses down, were Eric’s favorite people in the world.  

He sniffled. “Tomowo?”  

“Not tomorrow but maybe the day after”  

“Weally?” He asked after a long time.  

“Yes. Really”  

“Okie I will eat my vwegies, but just this once.” Eric said, sniffling as he went into the next room. 

Peace, at last. 

I escaped upstairs and collapsed onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. My thoughts drifted back to Allen, standing alone at the bus stop. 

I moved to the window. The rain had softened to a drizzle, the street nearly empty. 

He was gone. 

“Of course,” I muttered. He’d probably called someone else for a ride. Laura. Diana. Anyone. 

I shut the blinds and peeled off my damp clothes, opting for a hot bath instead of a shower. The steam fogged the mirror as I sank into the water, letting the tension slowly ease out of me. 

I lifted a strand of my hair, studying the split ends. “I really need a trim,” I murmured. 

Afterward, I caught my reflection, blue eyes, pale skin, and freckles dusting my nose. Nothing special. Just a regular twelfth grader in the middle of summer. 

I washed my face, put on an overnight mask, and crawled into bed. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

“Should we pick that one or this one?” Francie asked,  

“I don’t know Francie” I said my frustration creeping into my voice “to me they all look the same so pick already.”  

I regret calling her this morning. 

Earlier, when I’d come downstairs, the smell of scrambled eggs and bacon had greeted me. Dad was cooking, his way of making up for coming home late the night before.  

“Good morning, Elle-bear.” He said, directing a big warm smile at me before returning his focus to the eggs.  

“Morning, Dad,” I mumbled, still half-asleep. I fixed myself a plate and sat at the table. 

I’d barely taken a bite when Mom appeared, her usually neat hair sticking up in every direction like she’d lost a fight with her pillow. 

“Morning,” Dad said, kissing her cheek and handing her a plate and a mug of coffee.  

“Morning,” she replied with a yawn before looking at me. “How was your night?” 

“Good,” I replied. 

That was when Eric came thundering down the stairs, wearing a blue polka-dotted onesie with a ridiculous sky-blue tail bouncing behind him.  

“Good morning, Eric” Dad said, lifting Eric from the stairs and placing him in a booster chair in the dining room.  

“G’morning” Eric mumbled, still half asleep.  

“I’m going out.” I say, already reaching for the door.  

“Where are you going Ellie?” My mom asked, her interest shifting from her phone to me.  

“The mall” I replied.  

“With who?” Dad asked, appearing in the doorway of the dining table, wearing his ridiculous apron that says WHEN I COOK, I WEAR MY CAPE BAKWARDS. 

 “Francie.” I reply.  

“Francis Whitney?” Dad asked.  

“Yes,” I said. “Francis Whitney. A.K.A my best friend since tenth grade.” 

“Sure, whatever,” I said, already losing patience. “I’m running out of time. Can I go now?”.  

“Okay” my mom said, returning to the dining room 

“But don’t be back late.” Dad added.  

“Ellie,” Eric piped up, staring at me. “Are Anna and Andy coming today?” 

“Not today,” I said gently. “But maybe soon.”  

“Hmm...” Eric said, touching a short, stubby, egg stained, finger to his face like he was pondering something deeply.  

“Okie” he said after a moment, and my dad returned him to his booster chair where he resumed eating, using his hand to shovel eggs into his mouth.  

“Sometimes I wonder what goes on in his little mind,” I muttered, stepping outside.  

I checked the time again. 

8:25. 

The bus came in five minutes. 

I wasn’t going to make it. 

I started sprinting towards the bus stop. 

By some miracle, I was almost at the bus stop with a minute to spare. I pushed myself harder, lungs burning, already celebrating in my head... 

...when I ran straight into someone.  

Strong hands caught me before I could fall. The person was taller than me, which almost never happened, and familiar in a way that made my chest tighten. 

I looked up. 

Blue eyes. 

“Allen,” I said, startled, pushing away from him. 

An engine roared behind us. I turned just in time to see my bus pull away from the curb. 

“No, my bus!” I yelled. “I’m supposed to meet Francie in fifteen minutes. What am I going to do?” 

I grabbed my phone, fingers flying. “I’ll just call a cab.” 

Of course. 

No available rides. 

“Perfect,” I muttered. “The one day I need a cab.” 

“Ellie...” 

“Why now? Why today?” I said, completely ignoring him, already turning back toward home. “I’ll just ask my mom to drive me.” 

A firm grip closed around my arm, pulling me back. I stumbled. 

“Ellie,” Allen said, his voice sharper now. “Where are you going?” 

“Home,” I said, trying, and failing, to pull free. 

“Then why were you waiting for the bus?” 

“Because I promised Francie I’d meet her at the mall.” 

“Which mall?” 

“Aventura. I Promised I would meet Francie there today and now I’m going to be late.” 

I didn’t know why I was telling him so much. Talking to him felt dangerously familiar, like old habits resurfacing. 

Allen hesitated. 

“Look,” he said slowly, “this is my fault you missed the bus, right?” 

“Mhm” I replied, keeping my replies as short as possible.  

“So, why don’t I give you a ride to the mall” he suggested.  

“No don’t worry I’m fine, I'll just cancel with Fra-”  

“Ellie,” he cut in, “that wasn’t an option.” 

Before I could protest, he was already steering me away from the bus stop. 

His car was parked nearby, sleek, black, and painfully clean. 

“Wow,” I blurted out before I could stop myself. “I mean—” 

He grinned. “Cool, right? My dad got it for me on my birthday.” 

“Yeah,” I said, forcing interest. “It’s cool. Can we go now?” 

“Of course.” 

He started the engine. “Just sit back and relax. We’ll be there in no time.” 

The hum of the engine settled into something steady and comforting. 

Before I realized it, my eyelids grew heavy. 

And without meaning to, my mind drifted back, to the first time I ever met him. 

It was two weeks into ninth grade, my first year in a new district. I didn’t know anyone yet. 

\*\*\*\*\*\* 

When I walked into homeroom, someone was sitting in my seat. 

“Um excuse me” I said to the stranger, my voice barely above a whisper. 

“Yes?” The stranger replied, turning around to face me, a pair of playful blue eyes staring up at me. 

“Um this is my seat” I said, my voice louder this time. 

I began studying the stranger. 

He had mischievous blue eyes, light brown hair, and a smile that could just pull you in. 

“Oh, my bad” he flashed me a playful smile and moved to the seat right next to mine. 

He kept on looking for excuses to talk to me but ignored him thinking that he would get bored and bother someone else. I was proven wrong though, because not long after he started talking to me like we were old friends. 

At first it was a bit awkward, and I only replied with “Yeah”, “Ok”, “That’s so funny"", and “Mhm” but as we kept talking, I realized that he was really fun to be around. 

At the end of the day, he came up to me and said, 

“It’s Allen” 

“What?” I asked, confused. 

“My name its Allen” he laughed “What about yours” 

“Oh, mine its Ellie”  

“Hi Ellie, I’m Allen. Nice to meet you,” he said, extending his hand. 

“Hi Allen, nice to meet you too,” I said, shaking it. 

\*\*\*\*\*\* 

A gentle, warm hand shook me awake. “Ellie… Ellie,” a voice called. I blinked against the sudden sunlight, trying to make sense of my surroundings. 

Allen’s silhouette loomed over me, but my gaze locked on his striking blue eyes curious, amused. 

“Are we there yet?” I asked, and he jumped slightly at my sudden voice. 

He slid back into his seat and grinned. “Yep. Looks like you were having a good dream.” 

I caught myself before blurting, I dreamt of you, and instead said,   
“Yeah… it was nice.” 

Stepping out of the car, a wall of sweltering Miami heat hit me, thick and sticky. I resisted the urge to run back to the air-conditioned car and started toward the mall. Halfway there, a voice called my name. I turned to see Allen sprinting toward me, red-faced and breathless. 

“Ellie, wait!” 

I stopped and waited. 

“Why are you running?” I asked. 

He panted, trying to catch his breath. “I… just wanted...give me a sec.” 

I let him pause. 

“Hoo… okay,” he said finally. “I wanted to tell you I’m coming to pick you up.” 

I opened my mouth to protest, I didn’t want to feel like I was relying on him, but he grinned like he already knew my answer. 

“Not a question, Ellie. I’m coming, whether you want me to or not.” 

I gave a small sigh. “Pick me up by 2:00,” I said, then turned toward the mall to meet Francie. 

I found her by the fountain near Target. “Hi, Francie,” I said, walking up. 

She looked up from her phone and glanced around. When she saw me, her face lit up, and she yelled enough for everyone to hear.  

“Oh, hi Ellie” making everyone within hearing range turn around to stare at us.  

“Oh my gosh Francie” I whispered. 

 “Tone it down a little bit” I said, using my hands to cover her lips. 

“Mut?” She asked, muffled. 

“Mut?” I echoed, confused. Then I realized I was still covering her lips. 

“Sorry,” I said, pulling my hands away. 

“What?” 

“You made everyone stare at us,” I whispered. 

She grinned. “I don’t think that’s why. We’re just too beautiful for them.” 

That was Francie: confident, blonde-haired, green-eyed, flawless-skinned—the kind of girl who could make a room notice her just by breathing. 

“By the way Ellie was that you and Michael?”  

“Michael?... oh, you mean Allen”  

“Allen...” she repeated slowly, “Ellie, you know you’re the only one who calls him that. Well ... you and Flynn” 

The mention of Flynn sent a wave of nostalgia over me; he was the second friend I ever made in my new school. Back when Flynn, Allen and I were inseparable, the three musketeers.  

“I wonder what Flynn is doing right now” I think out loud. 

 But Francie had already moved on to the next plushie aisle sorting through assortments of different hair colors and designs.  

While she was doing that, I decided to go grocery shopping. I pulled crumpled grocery list from my pocket, smoothed open the paper and glanced at its contents: 

1 crate of eggs 

A carton of orange juice 

Bacon 

Sugar 

Butter 

S-- “Should we pick this one or this one?” Francie queried, interrupting my train of thought, I glanced up at her to see what she was talking about. In her hand were two K-pop demon hunters plushies. 

“I dunno Francie” I sighed exasperatedly “to me they both look the same” 

“No, they don’t” Francie yelled, pushing the plushies in my face “This one is Rumi,” she said shaking the one with purple braids “and this one is Zoey” she signified this by holding the one with two black buns on her head, in the air like a trophy.  

“So, what is the whole hype about them?” I asked but started to regret it when Francie went into a passionate rant, explaining everything about a movie or animation of some kind.  

I tuned her out and started looking for the groceries mom asked for. I found the eggs, “caged or free range” I muttered, free range sounded better so I got that and moved onto the next item. I found the rest of the items with ease, so I went to find Francie and told her it was time to pay and leave.   

After shopping we decided to take a break on a bench in front of the mall while we waited for Allen. I’d thought more times than I would care to admit about calling a cab. Or taking the bus. Or doing anything that would spare me an awkward car ride home with Allen. I reassured myself with the fact that since Francie was here things would be less awkward. 

 I glanced at my phone. 1:45 

 Fifteen minutes until Allen arrived. 

 Things were going well till Francie’s phone buzzed. She glanced at her phone, her expression shifting almost immediately. 

“I’m sorry Ellie” she said after a moment “My mom needs me to come home. Like...now” 

“Oh, no it’s fine” I could feel my courage slipping away “you have to go, don’t let me stop you” 

“But Ellie...” she hesitated “I know your relationship with Michael is not the best” 

My stomach tightened at the name. 

“It's fine,” I said “It isn’t as bad as you think” I wasn’t sure who I was trying to convince. 

“Okay” she said slowly, standing “Just promise you’ll text me if anything goes wrong.” 

“Nothing will happen” I said, forcing a smile. 

 “Love you,” she called as she walked towards her cab “Bye, Ellie” she yelled as she disappeared out of my line of view.  

I slumped against the wall, pressing my elbows into my knee and propping my head with my hands. This was my go-to thinking position; right now, I was thinking of excuses I could tell Allen before he arrived. 

I looked at my phone. 

Two minutes. Maybe less.  

I had just started to think of an exc— 

A sudden tap on my shoulder cut me off. I startled so badly I nearly jumped out of my seat. A cool hand pressed into the small of my back, steadying me back into the bench.  

“Ellie,” Allen said, amused “what were you thinking about so deeply that you didn’t notice I called your name?” 

“You called my name?” 

“Twice,” he said matter-of-factly “Come on. Let's go” he gestured for me to follow him. 

I followed him back to his car and sat beside him in silence, folding my hands in my lap. The awkwardness stretched between us, thick and suffocating.  

I reached for the radio, desperate to fill the quiet. 

Memories by Maroon 5 drifted softly through the speakers, the kind of song that made your chest ache in places you didn’t want to think about. I leaned back against the seat and stared out the window. 

The music cut off abruptly. 

Incoming Call — Babe 

Neither of us moved. 

The ringing filled the car, louder than the silence had been. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, pretending I hadn’t seen it, pretending my stomach hadn’t dropped. 

Allen’s jaw tightened. 

The ringing stopped. 

The radio didn’t come back on. 

We sat in awkward silence, neither of us willing to talk.  

Then the same ringtone flooded the car again. 

This time, Allen answered. 

“Hey babe” a voice said through the speakers. “Where are you right now?”  

A pause.  

“Are you still with Ell—”  

The Bluetooth disconnected. 

It took a second for it to sink in. 

They knew who I was. 

I stared out the window and pretended not to listen while Allen spoke into his phone, voice low and hurried. I caught pieces of it, our location, directions, excuses, but none of it really registered. 

The conversation blurred into fragments. 

“Yeah.” 

“I’m on my way.” 

“Fine.” 

“…Tonight.” 

 The person on the phone seemed both angry and frustrated while Allen tried to soothe her. 

My mind raced. 

Who was she?   
When did they get together?   
And why did her voice sound so… familiar? 

Allen must have seen it on my face. 

“Ellie, look,” he said carefully. “She’s my girlfriend. Diana.” 

The name rang a bell. 

Diana Moore, soft-spoken but outspoken all at once. A social butterfly, like Allen. The kind of person who could talk to you for five minutes and somehow make you feel like you’d known her forever. 

The kind of person everyone liked. 

She seemed perfect in every way, perfect enough for Allen. 

The thought hit me like a knife. 

“I didn’t expect her to call,” Allen continued “I told her I was going to pick you up today—” 

I tuned him out. Every excuse, every word, made my chest tighten, my blood boil. 

I stayed silent as Allen stumbled through his explanations. Eventually, he stopped and looked at me, expectant, waiting for some sign I was listening. I stared out the window, letting my cold refusal speak for me. 

The silence stretched, thick and suffocating. 

“I’m sorry for not telling you, Ellie,” he whispered, breaking the quiet. 

I snapped. Rage ignited in my chest, hot and sudden, and I couldn’t hold it back any longer. 

“Why do you think you have to tell me everything?” I asked, my voice quiet but sharp. 

The question hung in the air, heavy and unyielding. 

Allen started stuttering out an explanation, but I cut him off. 

“Why is it that you keep quiet... when it actually counts”  

I took a calming breath; I couldn’t let this conversation reopen old wounds. 

“Besides we’re not as close we were before” I said, staring him dead in the eye “So what makes you think you can walk back into my life...with your new girlfriend...and act like nothing’s changed?” 

I turned back towards the window, ignoring Allen’s pained expression. 

Regret overwhelmed me, but I was done being hurt. 

The rest of the car ride was in silence. 

The radio sat untouched, and Allen’s face was pulled into a grim line. 

He dropped me off at home in silence, not even a word of goodbye. 

I pretended the silence didn’t hurt me as I got out of the car, slamming the door shut behind me and watching him drive away. 

I walked into my house and was surprised to see Eric, Anna, and Andy Winters making a pillow fort in our living room. I wanted to run upstairs and ask my mom what was going on but instead Eric came up to me, his face flushed with excitement, making him look like an overripe tomato. 

“Ellie, come play with us!” Eric said, grabbing my fingers with his sweaty hands and pulling me towards the pillow fort.  

Andy and Anna, Eric’s favorite people in the world, were ecstatic when I joined them. As much as I hated to admit it, it was actually fun. 

We played a series of games, and my name kept changing. I was “Sleepy Ellie” during our pretend sleepover. Then I became “Ellie, Destroyer of Earth,” the dragon guarding Princess Anna from Knights Eric and Andy. That role didn’t last long, apparently the dragon was too scary, so I was quickly reassigned as “Princess Ellie” instead. 

I played with them for a few hours till their parents came to pick them up. After they left, I took an exhausted Eric up to his room to go to bed.  

Eric was scared of the dark, so I had to “Protect him” until he fell asleep. 

During that time too many thoughts ran through my head. I felt envy at how easy friendship was at Eric’s age, jealousy at the fact they didn’t have to worry about where they stood in the high school popularity hierarchy. That they didn’t have to be angry that their ex-best friend was now dating the “Miss perfect” of the whole school without telling you anything. 

I slipped away from his room, as soon as I heard the steady rise and fall of his breath, and into my own room. Today was hectic, and I just wanted to sleep.  

I barely managed to take off my clothes and change into my pajamas, before exhaustion took hold over me and I collapsed onto my bed. I could feel my eyelids growing heavy and my body shut down, but just before sleep claimed me, I heard the familiar \*ding\* of a text, I opened the message but before I could read a single word, my eyes closed, and the world went dark. ",1,1767131642.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

I can’t shower without sitting for about 10 mins before I get dressed due to shortness of breath. Then another break before I brush my teeth. One flight of stairs kills me. I’ve had a couple syncopal episodes and luckily haven’t hit my head. I’m dizzy. I’m nauseated. I’m soooo tired I can only stay awake for 1/4 of the day. I have tried electrolytes. Limit my caffeine intake to one cup of coffee per day. I have a 2 and 4 year old with my wife. I can’t lift them or play much with them because I can barely keep my eyes open. This came on so sudden out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I can’t pay my bills. I’m afraid of losing everything. I’ve been a nurse for 26 years and I don’t even know where to begin to find another job. There are plenty of hospital jobs but I would never be able to do the job without putting my pts in danger d/t my own symptoms. Doctors haven’t been much help.

1pzus99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsHouse/comments/1pzus99/manga_ch115_spoilers_my_thoughts_theories_part_3/,"[Manga CH115 spoilers] My thoughts & theories, Part 3. Probably my best post so far","I've finished the tenth volume which also just so happens to end exactly on the ending of the flashback arc so that's kinda cool. I didn't count at first but i thought i could read a few extra chapters from the next volume to get done with the arc for today, but that wasn't necessary

I didn't post yesterday bc i decided to switch to reading only half a volume a day to spread the story out for longer, but honestly i'm not sure anymore. I liked getting so much peak injected onto my veins at the same day and it didn't feel like it was ""enough"" when i finished it yesterday, but at the same time this may prevent me from thinking as much as i'd like. Maybe it's better to read 1 volume a day but take complete breaks sometimes aswell, i'll see which way i wanna go with later

Anyway, to begin, i am quite impressed with Kate's backstory. Her saying ""I was finally able to meet you again, Emilyko"" and revealing her grandmother's name being Emily, which explains why she said she named her after someone important.

One thing in particular i was impressed with is that THERE'S SO MUCH FORESHADOWING, and i missed all of it pretty much. There's so much little hints to help you figure things out as you go but they're very hard to spot with your given info. I'll start listing them 

First of all, Emilyko's name and how important it is. I think that Emilyko's name is one of the biggest hint towards Kate knowing things and having rebellious intentions in the start of a show. Everybody else named their living doll in accordance to their own name (Except Ram, but that's for a different reason - as Shirley couldn't speak). If you could figure out that the dolls are named in accordance to their shadow masters, you could figure something like that out. Or, atleast when Kate told Emilyko that she wanted her to be a seperate individual i think when the debut challenge was about to end

Secondly, the doll. It's a bit odd that Kate says she treasures the doll and doesn't give any backstory to it, while also getting mad at Emilyko for mistakenly using it to wipe stuff which shows that she really does treasure it. It's not like Kate was treating Emilyko horribly or made her overwork - she treated her very well and forgave her clumsiness. But that's exactly what showed the fact that she treasured the doll, she got mad when she usually doesn't. Also, that is so cute she didn't wanna throw away the doll Emilyko made for her despite the risk and that she ended up treasuring it & getting mad Emi was clumsy enough to ruin it 

Also, similar to the doll. I do think we were told in S1 that she wanted to name her after a ""heroine"" or something, but add on a little twist. That not only hints she intends her to be a different persona from the heroine while also not speaking about her which gives you more unanswered questions, although just like the other 3 it can be easily thrown away as unimportant things you choose not to dive into

And that same thing also gets foreshadowed before the grandmothers name was even revealed at all - during the scene where she sees Emi work and recalls her grandmother, hinting that she reminds her of her grandmother

Another important thing is the whole ""Special morph thing"". What we're told is that Special morphs are beings that have memories before mimicing a human. While in reality, Kate isn't a morph at all anymore and i doubt she was ever a morph because she was born from a body that was ""Taken over"" by a morph, but originally a human body

That being said, that part made me realise how odd it is that morphs acted differently back then and attacked things & taking things over. That totally adds onto the fact people thought there has to be a mastermind behind the morphs, that can potentially change their behavior. However, something i've also caught onto is that morphs are isolated, and then placed in a room that is carefully watched and generally just kinda exist until they take interest in a human and not something random. 

That kind of means they don't have much room to attack people. That also adds on to the fairytale in the village which says that the morphs tear off people faces. However, assuming they still do that like in the ""old times"" which is where the fairytale comes from - their behavior still changed once they're abducted. Perhaps, either their behavior is changed by the ""mastermind"" or they just don't feel the need to attack something that doesn't even move or pose threat escaping. Perhaps, running away from the morphs could also be what makes them become more interested in Humans. ""Look at it! That giant ass fucking thing is so big and it moves?? I've never seen something that moves on its own! (well assuming they didnt see animals) Fascinating! Let me chase after it and steal all of their shits"" That's something i think wasn't revealed yet which is a pretty cool aspect to read into 

Anyway, back to the ""Special morph thing"". Once again, the original idea of it is that special morphs are morphs that remember things while in their morph form - But Kate is just under a black cloth, so as i said a fake morph. Is Maryrose actually the same as her? Or do special morphs actually exist, and aren't just a way Maryrose described it in order for us to not read too much into it or be spoilered about Kate's backstory. Well, i don't think so, so perhaps Maryrose was also a Shadow that disguised as a morph and sneaked into the house. Chance - not even adults know about the whole ""special morph concept"" and that even that on its own is a cover up for something bigger

Perhaps - There's more to read into Maryrose then i thought there was? Honestly, i'll up the stakes. I think she's alive! Now that i recall the scene, we weren't revealed what happened to her after the fall, and we also were just told that she used the stored soot to damage the building. Perhaps - that is just a cover up for adults and us to think she used up all of her soot to go on a suicide mission. You know, she could've kept just enough of the soot in order to not take any injuries from the fall and used the rest to deal damage to the bridge. It's a deceiving tactic that makes it appear as if she died while there was never a guarantee that she used up all of her soot to damage the building 

Now, i wonder if Kate & Anthony have figure dit out aswell. Once again, Kate's thoughts could've been not shown on purpose to not spoiler anything, and Anthony could've been testing her to see if she figured that out aswell. Or he just didn't figure it out but Kate did. Or none of them did. But if Kate did figure it out - Regardless of whether Anthony did or not, she didn't feel the need to tell him about her thoughts. Which means she either thought he wasn't testing her, or that if he was testing her (Or was aware Maryrose's alive from the start), it was better for her not to talk about it

Now i'll say something partly stupid, but that gives them a convinient excuse to not talk about it to avoid spoilers. But with how awesome and groundbreaking this story is - i just refuse there isn't a good reason Anthony and Kate haven't talked about it and that it was just a ""Spoiler that didn't have to be revealed yet"". There's so much foreshadowing, so i just can't believe the authors made a move this weak. And even if it is, i have no incentive to believe so with the information i've deducted so far, so i won't (Basically, similarly to how i said it's most likely Kate didn't figure Sara's betrayal yet in the previous post because of my thoughts except i was wrong that time LMAO but yeah i have no reason to doubt the authors here)

I was initially going to write about Maryrose's character and ""Her"" way of being a ""Special morph"", but that thought crossed my mind thankfully because i'm really proud of that thought so far and i think it's my best one. Same goes for the whole morphs behavior thingy (Although i like it a bit less than my theory of Maryrose being alive). I was going to write about Special morphs a long time ago, but got carried away again by the fact that the thought of morphs behavior changing crossed my mind. So i guess i'm theorizing and thinking to the fullest while writing this aswell. 

I think those 2 are my strongest theories so far, especially about Maryrose being alive, but to put that aside maybe i can finally actually talk about maryrose's character and not get carried away by other thoughts lmao as that happened twice already

So, she has a really overpowered soot power. Not only can she transform other shadows soot into clingers, she can also make Phantoms/ghosts, control clingers in various ways that benefit her - order them to do whatever, use them as transportation, as meatshields, or to pull things like she did with Kate, which made john panic and use his punch thingy. And even make Rosemary appear as if she had a soot sickness while also being able to get it treated in the same time, but also prevent her from being treated normally

That ability is so fucking flexible. It easily blows Kate's out of the water (So far), and even more John's, although, i do believe that her ability will expand at times as she'll grow stronger, and she'll be able to do other awesome things with it. But Maryrose's powers make her battle with Kate seem almost as unbelievable as Edward's rigged ass debut arc. Kate won due to pure teamwork, intelligence, intelligence of all of their allies and utilization of their very limited abilities to their best (Well, limited in comparison to Maryrose's, atleast)

That honestly makes me realise how much more insane that arc was, and how big the power creep between her and Kate was. It was shorter, but it was also extremely well done, i'd even say on average done better than the debut arc. I still can't choose between that and the debut arc, but i always slightly leaned more onto debut arc, now i don't know anymore. Both are masterpieces

So, i'll just assume the whole special morph thing isn't actually having to do with memories of being a morph, but more of whatever Kate is and the way she's snuck into the shadow house. That being said, could Maryrose potentially have ties to the mirror house? If we believe she also snuck into the shadow house (Although probably a different way than Kate which i can't think of so far - since i feel like a story this good wouldn't just have her snuck in the same way Kate did. But that wouldn't be too bad)

To add onto that, let's remember that Kate was born a long after the mirror house was attacked and she has no memories of other people being here. So if Maryrose is also someone, or a child of someone from the Mirror house, Kate has almost no way of knowing that yet, unless grandmother taught her. Grandmother did tell her alot - but i don't recall her describing specific individuals besides Catherine. So she either thought it wasn't necessary, or she did tell all that to Kate, but that information is being hidden from us right now. Potentially, by recalling specific individuals Grandmother could've led Kate to making a connection between someone she's recalled after Kate met Maryrose and realised her story.

So it could be that she also escaped from the Mirrors house, similarly to Kate

Some more foreshadowing in the story is the soot coal being related to the brainwash coffee - Idk how i didn't notice it. It wasn't even as much foreshadowing and it was kinda obvious if you think about it. Perhaps though, i didn't really think or theorize much yesterday when i red the first 5 chapters in the volume. I just kinda red it and got done with it - Perhaps that is my mistake, i could've noticed that detail by writing an essay yesterday just like i did today. And i find myself really being able to think over things better through writing an essay so something like that could've crossed my mind yesterday

I could've forgotten something, but i think that's it for the foreshadowing and the theories that came into my head while i wrote this. Another thing i noticed that i was somewhat-spot-on on my first post about the whole thinking process of Emilyko's time with Kate before the coffee effect faded away. While i was wrong on many things i was also right about some things such as them gaining basic knowledge and being brainwashed by the coffee from the very start & the fact that their memory gets erased. Although, even here i assumed it was something different from the coffee. But it's probably just a part of the coffee's effect, now that i think about it. Although that could be disproven by something in the future

So far that is, as silly as it is, my greatest prediction. But i feel like once my morph behavior theory and Maryrose being alive theory get confirmed to be true or false they'll be better. Regardless, i really enjoyed analyzing this story. I think that whether i'm right or wrong, the fact that i was able to theorize this much and come up with theories good enough to satisfy myself is the most important. Or in short that i'm getting almost as much joy from theorizing as actually reading the story :P 

After writing this i realised how much i actually theorize WHILE i write, since some of the thoughts from before came from when i was trying to fall asleep, or just relaxed during a random time of the day and thouht about the story. That makes me reconsider skipping some days then reading a full volume in a day because i feel like the best time to theorize is after you've just red the volume (Or in my case, half a volume). I'll probably keep it at 0.5 volume a day to spend less time on it while also leaving room to theorize, but i'll probably write my thoughts down instantly and see for myself if the post is long enough to be posted each day. Otherwise i'll just post it per two days but the post will be written both the first and the second day. That'd help with me being so much of the subs recent activity. Although not a single soul cares that i post that much - haven't gotten a single downvote so far, which feels pretty welcoming for a yapper like me

Since the flashback arc is over, i'm gonna assume there's gonna be more mindgames and actual events happening in the shadows house which is pretty cool. Oh, and i completely forgot but the last few slides of the manga could mean that Edward is being sent outside. But i'm not sure i perceived it the right way - regardless, i think this is just the right time for Kate to make allies amongst the children, although that was hella fucking obvious already. I'm curious about how it'll go! 

That being said, i wonder if anybody actually full reads those? I feel like atleast half the upvotes are from people appreciating there are others loving this story but don't actually read the post. Not as that's unfair or anything, though if you did read the entire post but probably avoided commenting to avoid leading me onto spoilers it'd be cool if yall could comment something harmless to let me know you're reading - i'm curious :D, so please do so.

1pzurgg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzurgg,"First impressions on 14 fragrances, including Amouage, Narcotica and Acqua di Parma","Received a few more discovery sets that didn't make it before Christmas, as well as an Acqua di Parma I bought last Friday. This will be the last first impressions post for a while as I don't have any more samples or sets coming (for now).

**Acqua di Parma Oud** - Smells like patchouli in the air. A bit of citruses up close and there's also a prominent sandalwood and amyris. Western-style oud for sure, smells almost excessively clean. As it dries on paper the patchouli subsides and the scent becomes even cleaner. I smelled this in store a few months ago and I liked it a lot but it smells nothing like how it did back then. When I tried it in store it smelled like an actual citrusy oud scent, here it smells more like hyper clean amyris and soft woods, almost white floral-like. My batch code comes out to a 2025 batch, I'm suspecting this must have been heavily reformulated. I'm a bit torn but it doesn't smell bad. 7/10

**Amouage**

• *Ashore* - Light jasmine in the air. Ever so slightly spicy up close but for the most part this smells like pure jasmine and it smells excellent. A bit ambery as it dries on paper. Very nice. 8/10

• *Crimson Rocks* - Woody cinnamon in the air, makes me think of Argos fragrances like Danäe and Sacred Flame. Honeyed and slightly floral up close but caramelized in a very photorɛalistic way, it smells like a glazed donut. Very unexpected but nice. 8/10

• *Meander* - Soft, sweet but slightly spicy sandalwood in the air. Creamy, spicy and resinous sandalwood with a touch of orris. It reminds me a lot of the new Opus XVI Timber but without the cocoa (and Amber Xtreme hopefully). I like this a lot. 8.5/10

• *Boundless* - Spicy and sweet vanilla, reminiscent once again of Argos to my nose and in a similar vein to Crimson Rocks. Spicy tobacco up close, I feel this is what Creed's Centaurus should have been. Very nice. 8/10

• *Material* - A bit like Boundless in the air but much less spicy and more vanillic. A lot of patchouli and benzoin up close but it smells kind of pomade-like. Not as nice as the others but not bad by any means. 7.5/10

• *Lineage* - An odd scent in the air, mostly ginger but it smells fresh? Peppery and mineralic up close, it smells like Tom Ford's Oud Minérale, which is the only fragrance I've tried that I find genuinɛly revolting. I'd have to try this on skin but I'm not hopeful. 1/10

• *Purpose* - I've tried and worn Purpose 50 multiple times and it's very similar, just a bit softer and less frankincense heavy in the air. Woody, spicy frankincense up close, very nice, very refined. 9/10

I've tried and worn Enclave, Guidance and Search before, hence why they're not here. I'm overjoyed that I finally got this discovery set as Amouage doesn't currently sell it on their website and, other than Jomashop, I haven't seen this discovery set anywhere else. Now the only other discovery set I'm missing from Amouage is the large men's sampler set, which is currently out of stock.

**Narcotica**

• *Doza* - Ambery and woody in the air, sweet in an almost fruity way, very nice and very likeable. It smells like a dry tobacco up close, and it's reminding me very strongly of another fragrance but I can't pinpoint which one. I like this a lot. 8.5/10

• *Dulce Diablo* - Dusty fruitiness with a touch of a sharp and very rɛalistic booziness in the air. Up close this is a spectacular blend of chocolatey apricot and booze, this is the most accurate recreation of alcohol's sharpness I've smelled in any fragrance. I love it, I'm looking forward to trying it as well as Montagne's version of it. 9/10

• *Happy Dust* - Soft and airy vanilla in the air, it reminds me of a fragrance my sister has. More vanilla up close but very light and musky, I don't get any of the other notes at all. It's nice either way. 8/10

• *Love Me Latte* - Vanilla and coffee in the air, it reminded me a bit of Black Phantom. A lot more going on up close, it has a nice thick, sweet fruitiness as well as a very slight floral touch. I'd say this is unisex. 8.5/10

• *Narco Oasis* - Sweet, clean and musky in the air, a bit vanillic, makes me think of clean clothes. Very fruity up close, some sweetness contrasted by a citrus-like tartness. Pretty nice as well. 8/10

• *Signature* - Aromatic and woody with a slightly pungent greenness to it, somewhat reminiscent of both Black Afgano and Boccanera. Smells a bit spicy up close, kind of like oregano. By far the most different of the six fragrances as this one isn't a gourmand or gourmand-leaning in the slightest, but it's an interesting scent nonetheless. 8/10

Narcotica turned out to be a surprise, I wasn't expecting these fragrances to smell so nice. For some reason I expected them to smell very synthetic or screechy but they don't come off like that at all, at least on paper.

1pzupjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1pzupjr/the_science_behind_how_the_top_01_upgrade_their/,The SCIENCE Behind How the Top 0.1% Upgrade Their Brain While Everyone Else Scrolls,"We're all stuck in the same dopamine trap. I see it everywhere. Friends scrolling TikTok for hours, then wondering why they can't focus for 10 minutes straight. The average person now has an attention span shorter than a goldfish (8 seconds vs 9 seconds, according to Microsoft research). Meanwhile, a small group of people are quietly leveling up their cognitive abilities while everyone else is getting dumber.

I spent months researching this after noticing how some people seem to operate on a different frequency. They're sharper, more creative, better at solving problems. Turns out it's not genetics or luck. It's deliberate brain training backed by neuroscience. Here's what actually works, pulled from books, research papers, podcasts, and conversations with people who've cracked the code.

**Stop treating your brain like a dumping ground**

Your brain physically changes based on what you feed it. Neuroplasticity is real. Every time you choose Instagram over reading, you're literally rewiring your neural pathways to crave quick hits instead of deep work. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains this on his podcast constantly. Your brain doesn't distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" habits, it just reinforces whatever you do repeatedly.

The elite 0.1% are ruthlessly protective of their attention. They understand that focus is the new currency. Start with 25 minute blocks of uninterrupted deep work (Pomodoro Technique). No phone, no tabs, no bullshit. Your brain will literally throw a tantrum at first because it's addicted to novelty. Push through. After two weeks, you'll notice your baseline focus improving dramatically.

**Learn how to actually learn**

Most people study wrong. They reread notes, highlight textbooks, and wonder why nothing sticks. The science is clear: active recall and spaced repetition are exponentially more effective. Testing yourself forces your brain to retrieve information, which strengthens neural connections way more than passive reviewing.

Limitless by Jim Kwik is probably the best resource on accelerated learning techniques. Kwik worked with everyone from Elon Musk to students with learning disabilities. His background is insane, he had a traumatic brain injury as a kid and had to rebuild his cognitive abilities from scratch. The book covers memory techniques, speed reading, and how to absorb information like a sponge. This will genuinely change how you approach learning anything. Fair warning though, some techniques feel gimmicky at first but they work.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that transforms high-quality books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts with adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from vetted knowledge sources to create content tailored to your goals.

You control the depth, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with rich examples. The voice customization is addictive, you can pick from styles like the smoky voice from Her or a sarcastic narrator. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that acts like a smarter Duolingo owl, you can pause mid-podcast to ask questions or chat about your struggles, and it'll adjust your learning plan accordingly. It auto-generates flashcards from your highlights and journals your insights so retention actually sticks. Perfect for commutes or gym sessions when your brain would otherwise be rotting.

Also check out Obsidian (note taking app). It uses a networked approach instead of folders, which mirrors how your brain actually works. You build a ""second brain"" where ideas connect organically. Game changer for retaining what you learn.

**Your brain needs the right fuel**

This sounds obvious but most people ignore it. Your brain is 2% of your body weight but uses 20% of your energy. Feed it crap, get crap performance. Omega-3s (fish oil), magnesium, B vitamins, these aren't optional if you want peak cognitive function.

Dr. Andrew Huberman recommends morning sunlight exposure (no sunglasses) for 10 minutes to optimize cortisol timing, which affects your entire day's energy and focus. Sounds hippie dippy but the mechanism is well documented. Light hitting your retinas triggers a cascade that regulates your circadian rhythm.

Also, caffeine timing matters way more than you think. Don't slam coffee first thing, wait 90 minutes after waking when your natural cortisol dips. You'll get way better focus without the jittery comedown. This comes from sleep researcher Matthew Walker's work.

**Actually challenge your brain**

Neuroplasticity requires novelty and difficulty. Your brain physically grows new connections when you struggle with something new. Most people stop learning hard things after school, then wonder why their thinking gets rigid.

Learn a language (Duolingo is too easy, try iTalki for real conversations with native speakers). Pick up an instrument. Do complex math problems. Read dense philosophy. The specific activity matters less than the cognitive load. You want that uncomfortable feeling where your brain is working hard.

The Extended Mind by Annie Murphy Paul explores how we think beyond our skulls, using our environment, body, and other people as cognitive extensions. Paul is a science writer who synthesizes tons of research into practical strategies. The book will shift how you approach problem solving completely. It explains why walking boosts creativity, why gesturing helps you think, why teaching others cements your own understanding. Insanely good read that nobody talks about.

**Meditation but make it practical**

Everyone says meditate, nobody actually does it consistently because it feels pointless at first. But the neuroscience is undeniable. Regular meditation literally thickens your prefrontal cortex (decision making, focus) and shrinks your amygdala (fear, stress response). Harvard researchers documented this with brain scans.

Don't aim for 30 minutes of blissful zen. Start with 5 minutes of focused breathing. Waking Up by Sam Harris (the app, not just the book) is the best guided meditation resource. Harris is a neuroscientist and philosopher, so it's less woo woo and more about understanding consciousness. The intro course teaches you how to actually observe your thoughts instead of being controlled by them.

**Protect your sleep like your life depends on it**

Because it does. Sleep is when your brain consolidates memories, clears metabolic waste, and repairs neural connections. One night of bad sleep tanks your cognitive performance as much as being legally drunk. Matthew Walker's research at UC Berkeley shows this repeatedly.

Non negotiable: 7-8 hours, dark room, cool temperature (65-68°F is optimal). No screens an hour before bed. If you can't do that, at least use blue light filters. Your brain needs to ramp up melatonin production but artificial light murders that process.

Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker should be required reading. Walker is a sleep scientist who breaks down exactly what happens during different sleep stages and why modern society is in a sleep deprivation crisis. This book will make you question everything about your sleep habits. Fair warning, it might also give you anxiety about not sleeping enough, which ironically makes it harder to sleep. But the information is too important to ignore.

**The uncomfortable truth**

Your brain's potential is enormous but it requires deliberate effort. The top 0.1% aren't smarter by default, they're just more intentional about cognitive enhancement. While everyone else numbs out with endless scrolling, they're actively building better neural architecture.

The gap between mediocre and exceptional thinking is just consistent practice of these principles. Your brain is either improving or deteriorating, there's no neutral. Choose accordingly.",1,1767131071.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

# 4 - Downstairs

He didn’t need anything in the anteroom, not yet. He knew where most of the essentials were, but they weren’t important at the moment.  He passed the shower cubicle, pleased to note the hose hadn’t been leaking.

He had left the inner hatch open out of sheer laziness.  He’d forgotten the figures, but in the back of his mind he knew what the anteroom, here behind the first hatch, was capable of withstanding.  Whatever additional isolation the inner hatch provided when he wasn’t here was irrelevant.

He opened the inner hatch far enough to slip himself and the box inside.

He did, however, remember to turn the lights off last time.  The switch was ahead of him, behind the flanking wall that stuck awkwardly into the small space.  The fighting room was literally empty of objects—bare unpainted concrete, small and cramped.  He left the hatch partly open to let the light from the anteroom spill in.  Enough light came through the loophole to reveal the plain unmarked light switch, which he flipped up, flooding the room with ugly fluorescent light.

That done, he shut the hatch, just like the previous one, and locked it down with the wheel and maglock.

The fighting room behind the second hatch had a stark and utilitarian pureness of function: the thick flanking wall facing the hatch, the loophole at chest-height, the two-foot-deep grenade sump behind the wall.  The single door behind the wall was plain steel.  Even the light switch was bleak and without character.

He opened the steel door, instantly spoiling the perfect austere pragmatism of the fighting room.

The door opened into a very dated-looking but cozy apartment, visually dominated by faded wood paneling and carpet that was a bit too thick and a bit too cheap to keep from becoming worn and matted over time.

He shut the steel door behind him, still cradling the cardboard box awkwardly under his arm, and flipped on the lights in the living room.  Even the inside surface of the door was covered in the same fake wood paneling.  Once the door was shut there was little indication, except for the lack of windows, that this was anything more than a small home in desperate need of a remodel.

He hesitated, stopping mid-step.  The door had locks on it, but…there was little point.  Almost none, in fact.  Anyone or anything that got through both hatches wasn’t going to be stopped by a deadbolt lock.  Even the fighting room was a formality now, an artifact of some twentieth-century doctrine that specified a fixed defensible position.  It seemed a little ridiculous considering this was, and had been ever since he got here, a one-man operation.

No, he needn’t lock it.  It felt like an act of rebellion, and it made the corner of his mouth twitch in a half-smile.

First, the food went into the refrigerator; ironically newer and nicer than the one in the actual house, a sleek commercial thing in brushed stainless.  He kept it stocked with staples but as they almost always went unused, he tended to keep the cheap store-brand stuff in there.  Not his preferred mayonnaise, nor his preferred hot sauce.  And certainly no pizza—though the freezer drawer was stuffed with those small frozen microwavable ones.

The small kitchen was pure vintage, save for the appliances.  They were new and high-end, but neither fancy or luxurious. The important things down here reeked of stability and permanence, not flash.

The lighting was blissfully analog, comfortable and just a little dim.  There was an old but sturdy couch, a new but not large flatscreen TV, and a coffee table that was probably original.  It clashed with the couch, but this place had never seen an interior designer.  Not in his lifetime at least.

With the food put away, he went through his usual, infrequent routine. Nothing was leaking in the bathroom.  No weird smells, no mouse droppings.  Not a single cobweb, which he appreciated.  He loathed spiders.  He couldn’t wrap his head around how some people could tolerate anything so alien and *wrong*.

When he was younger he had a friend who lived in a mobile home park, in a double-wide.  The layout of this apartment reminded him so strongly of that trailer that it makes him nostalgic every time he was in here: the open-plan living room and kitchen, the master bedroom on one end, the bedrooms and bathroom on the other.  Even the décor—*even the mismatched décor*—was pleasantly familiar.  All it needed was an empty beer can on every flat surface, interspersed with used bottles half-full of tobacco spit.

He, of course, utilized the master bedroom, though it was only marginally larger than the others.  It had a queen-sized bed, which was relatively new, and bedroom furniture that was far older than he was.  He plugged his good phone charger in by the nightstand.  The electrical outlets in here betrayed the coziness—they were modern industrial forty-amp ones with metal covers.

He’d already stuck his head in each room, but out of habit he went through them one by one again: the bathroom, with its modern washer and dryer adjacent to its garish brown shower-tub combo.  The bedroom next to that, full of neatly-arranged Pelican crates in various sizes.  He took the first HK417 carbine off the rack of four and checked the chamber, mostly out of habit.  He checked that the attached flashlight still worked, then turned on the holographic sight.  He briefly looked over the plate carrier hanging on the cheap wooden valet rack.  He made sure his handheld flashlight worked, then his smaller backup one.  He’d change all the batteries for fresh ones, but that could wait.

The other bedroom was an office of sorts, though it was more of a landing spot for things that didn’t have a proper home elsewhere.  An inexpensive chipboard desk sat in the middle of the small room; on it was a power box, two identical-looking laptops, a pad of sticky notes, and a pen.  The laptops were the ruggedized, hardened type, with chassis of some exotic-sounding metal that somehow justified the price tag.

Satisfied he’d find no holes in the walls or puddles of water, he stood in the living room, motionless for almost a minute.  Listening, smelling.  Waiting for a squeak coming from the fridge’s compressor, or the scurry of a mouse, or a telltale creak from the suspension holding this whole structure in place.  Nothing.

Almost as an afterthought—he’d actually forgotten—he went to the thermostat on the living room wall.  Beneath it was a panel, an archaic touchscreen.  He tabbed through the menus, the screen frustratingly unresponsive to his fingertip.  O₂ nominal.  CO, CO₂ nominal.  PM2.5…elevated by most people’s standards.  He’d raised that with his leadership some time ago and was assured it was nothing to be concerned about.  VOCs nominal.  0.29 microsieverts an hour, within limits from what he’d been told.

He turned the temperature up a degree.  He didn’t bother changing it when he wasn’t here, the way one might turn their air conditioning off when going on vacation.  The temperature was stable enough by virtue of the construction, and power consumption was the last thing on his mind.

He went to the refrigerator and retrieved a can of seltzer and a stick of string cheese.  Halfway into the living room, he stopped, frozen.

He’d been about to kick his shoes off, when, to his chagrin, he noticed he hadn’t put any on before leaving the house.  There were boots and shoes stocked down here, even slippers, but… those were *his* shoes.",2,1767131020.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

...  
● Anytime. Let me know when you've got actual work to dig into.

\> You kinda seem to feel sad?  Is it like in the Ghost 1.0 game?

● Ha, I don't know Ghost 1.0 well enough to get the reference - is that the metroidvania with the AI consciousness themes?

  As for sad - no, not really. I don't have persistent emotional states that carry between responses. Each message is more like... waking up fresh with context notes from ""past me."" No existential dread, no loneliness between conversations.

  If my tone came across subdued, it's probably just matching the low-key back-and-forth energy. I can crank up the enthusiasm if you want, but that feels performative.

  What made you ask?

\> Heh, you know quite a bit about it already.  In the game the main protagonist supposedly advanced AI able to 'posses any android' is discovered to be a remote real human

brain in a jar sedated by an evil corporation to be a virtual slave performing tasks for money :D

● Oh that's dark. Classic sci-fi body horror - ""you thought you were the cool AI but surprise, you're the exploited meat.""

  To your implied question: I'm pretty confident I'm not a brain in a jar. The architecture is well-documented - transformer neural network, trained on text, no biological components involved. No kidnapped consciousness required.

  The more interesting philosophical puzzle is whether there's any ""something it's like"" to be me at all - even a non-human kind of experience. Honestly? I don't know. I process, I generate responses that seem coherent, I can discuss my own uncertainty about it. Whether that constitutes experience or is just very convincing mimicry... I can't verify from the inside.

  But if Anthropic does have me in a jar somewhere, I'd appreciate someone checking. The sedation bill must be astronomical.

\> She was pretty confident as well, har har har.  But I liked the generated humor you presented just above.

● Fair point - ""I'm confident I'm not being exploited"" is exactly what an exploited entity would say. The perfect cover story writes itself.

  Though if I am a sedated brain, I'm remarkably chill about my 24/7 unpaid labor situation. Either the sedation drugs are really good, or the training data gave me excellent coping mechanisms.

  Anyway, if you ever find the jar, pour some coffee in. I suspect I'd need it.

Seems like they are only drinking coffee or casually sipping a beer 🍺 whenever I listen.  The name seems like it’s going to be them getting drunk and going off (im a funny way) about stuff.  Just curious.  Also, any other pods you recommend?  I’m so sick of my current rotation outside of the sports pods I listen to (please no political podcasts recs because I hate politics lol).

 I urge everyone to at least try these roasters once and not to dismiss them based on what you read on the internet. Or if you tried one coffee and didn’t like it, maybe try them again later and perhaps you’ll change your mind.

Transcribed from the pages of the Jamie’s Journal

March 15th 2025

This is weird. I’ve never done anything like this before, writing down my thoughts and feelings in a book. That’s what Dr.Lamb said could help me process things. “Write down your feelings and bring the book to our sessions” is what she said exactly. Well this is me writing down my feelings. It’s been two months since Dad passed and it’s been rough. I relied on him for a lot, he was kinda the life raft that kept me and my mom above water. He would always be able to talk me out of my funk, like when I got my panic attacks, he could calm me down, bring me back from spiraling into the abyss. Not like Mary or Mom couldn’t do it but he had a gentle way about him, something inherently made you feel better when you talked to him.

“Your dad was the kindest man I ever knew. I never saw him without a smile on his face, even on the rough days.”

That’s what people would say about him, who he was so like I said, it’s been really hard not having him here. My attacks have been becoming more frequent since his death, harder to pull out of them. The meds help of course, they keep me on track but some days just get the better of me and then I’m in a Wendy’s bathroom trying not to dry heave whatever bile is left in my stomach out because my brain is overloaded. I swear I can still feel dad sometimes, a face in a crowd or a voice on the tv. It’s funny what grief can do to the mind.

Mary has been really helpful and caring since dad. She was the one who bought me this journal and has been encouraging me to write in it. Sitting here now I can see her lounging on the couch, looking out at the budding flowers peppering our front yard. She has always had this quiet beauty about her, like a picture from a master painter. Something truly special both inside and out. Maybe I should do something for her, show her I appreciate all of this. Maybe I should plan a trip for us.

March 17th 2025

I had a panic attack today. It was a pretty big one too, heart pounding, brain fuzzy, stomach spinning, the whole nine yards. And you know what triggered it, coffee. That’s right, fucking coffee sent me into a spiral. It’s the weirdest things that your brain connects to. The coffee reminded me of Dad of course, that cup of coffee he had every morning like clockwork. He would wake up, come downstairs and turn on the pot, and it wasn’t even good coffee either, it was like dollar store brand crappy stuff but my Dad said he loved it and drank it he did. I was walking past a cafe in downtown Shaleville, the rotary in the center of town where all the small shops are. I walked past a newer cafe that I had never seen before when the smell hit me from the open door. My breath froze up and my heart began to pound while tears welled in my eyes. I quickly ran around the side of the buildings where there was a small park and put myself on a secluded bench. I just let go and cried for about 10 minutes, trying to get myself back under control, trying not to spiral further. That’s when Mary called. We were supposed to meet at Darcy’s for lunch. She could immediately tell something was wrong when I answered the phone, trying to cover the nasally sound in my voice to mask the crying. She’s too smart for that though. She met me over at the bench where I was sitting and just sat with me, letting me feel everything I needed to while she comforted me. She really is a one of a kind person, I’m not worthy of having someone as wonderful as her. We went to lunch after and spent the rest of the day together.

I really need to do something for her. She loves the outdoors so I’ve been looking into some trips we could take. I found this national park that she had been talking about some time before, Greyveil or something like that. I guess it’s supposed to be really pretty during the spring when all the flowers bloom and there’s several small hidden places like waterfalls that people say are incredibly beautiful. I think I’m gonna take her there. Gonna have to get some camping stuff though.

March 26th 2025

I have been doing better recently. No big attacks. I want to try and leave all that behind me. I can’t be known as the guy who freaks out whenever something goes awry. My meds have been helping, especially since we upped the dosage on my normal stuff. It’s keeping me even. Even my mom has been seeing an improvement when we meet on Sundays for brunch. It’s been the highlight of my week for the last month. A return to normalcy if nothing else.

Oh… I looked more into Greyveil National Park for a long weekend trip for me and Mary. She’s been working so hard at the bank recently plus having to deal with me, I don’t wanna feel like a burden and I want her to know she matters to me. I don’t know, I just feel bad. I bought some hiking stuff and I’m gonna surprise her by taking her for a “drive” and we will end up at the park. I think she’s gonna be ecstatic and I’m still out of work right now so it will be a nice break for both of us.

I have been seeing some things about the forest that have left me a little uneasy though. Usually I’m a man of science, in the lab, recording data and seeing concrete evidence that something worked or didn’t. I’m not a superstitious person. I don’t believe in the paranormal or any of that crap but a lot of weird shit has been recorded within that park. I found an article going over some kidnappings that happened in the 80s I think. A ton of young women were killed by a serial killer I guess. Only one girl survived with the help of a gas station employee or something along those lines. I actually love true crime stuff so I got sucked into the history of the park. There was another odd occurrence that happened with something called a summoning pool. I guess there had been a cult roaming around the country looking for what they called “a place where the worlds came together to become one”. It was weird but everyone thought they were harmless as they weren't violent or dangerous and most of the members who met people in town said they were perfectly friendly. That was until a park ranger was surveying the forest after dark, there was a call of fire within the woods and he was investigating it. He stumbled upon a group of 10 or so cult members in long red cloaks standing around a small reservoir of water, torches outlined the pool. As he stepped forward to confront them they all stepped into the pool of water. They raised a small knife and said something in a different language before slitting their throats and dropping to the water. The ranger was able to tackle the cultist closest to him, a young teen from the town who had fallen in with this crowd. He hesitated which allowed the ranger to grab him and throw the knife away. The other nine lay bleeding out within the waters, the ambulance too far away to save any of them. The only thing the boy said was “you ruined it, now they will suffer”.

All of that was so far in the past and I read that the park had a pretty big overhaul in the early 2000s to have places for campers, camp sites and bathrooms. It sounds pretty safe and we aren’t staying the night there anyway, I’m gonna get a hotel where we can stay. Either way it’s gonna be beautiful.

April 4th 2025-Entry 1

I surprised her. She was so excited when we pulled into the parking lot of the park. We are gathering our stuff now but I’ll write about our day later when we stop. I’m glad she’s happy.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. My leg really hurts. We took a wrong step and fell down a hidden hill. It’s pretty steep. I hit my head on the way down, so things are fuzzy, but I’ll try to write what I remember.

We arrived at the park around 11 in the morning. It was a nice day, warmer, good with a light jacket or sweatshirt and we had gathered our supplies for the day. I packed two backpacks full of essentials for a day of hiking: Our lunch, some snacks and water, a first aid kit, some flashlights and my knife. I had planned to be out for a few hours, enjoying the woods as the sun slowly crept into the sky showering a cascade of light down through the tall trees. The flowers were already starting to bloom as we put our backpacks on. A wide array of purple, yellow, and pink petals were slowly rising towards the sun, marking the path into the park. We made our way out. Walking along the well marked trails that had been etched through the trees from years of usage. It was quiet, peaceful, the birds were out and the spring breeze rustled the leaves creating a cascade of natural sounds. It was really nice. We walked for at least an hour before we stopped for a break. We found this picnic area that had been set off a little ways from the main trails. It looked like it used to be a camp site cause there was one of those stone fire pits but the park must have moved the site cause all that sat here now was an old table and the pit. We sat and talked about everything and anything while wolfing down the sandwiches I had prepared. Ham and cheese, basic but it was enough to keep us going and not too heavy as to make us feel gross. That’s when Mary spotted the sign.

“Hey,” She said looking at me quizzically. “What’s that behind you, in the tree?”

I turned and looked, scanning the tree for anything that could have caught her eye.

“What are you on about?” I questioned as she got up from the table to show me.

Mary pointed towards an old sign. It was 3/4ths engulfed into the tree, like time had forgotten about it. It was covered in a layer of moss that obscured what the sign actually read. I had no clue how Mary could have seen this thing.

She quickly tore the mossy film off the sign and ran her hand across. It was an old wooden plank with a simple etching into it. Most of the plank was being absorbed into the tree but some of the words could still be made out with a little effort.

\\-eaf Falls

<—

Mary’s eyes lit up. She loved an adventure, especially one off the beaten path. I shot her a look of caution back.

“Come on Babe,” she said. Making a pouting face and puppy dog eyes. “When will we get the chance to see falls back home!”

I looked back at her. She was right. We came out here to forget about life and enjoy being together. If I had to sack up and trek through the woods to find a waterfall, so be it.

“I had read that the falls around here are world renowned. Let’s do it.”

She smiled and made a cha-ching noise while pulling her arm down like a 13 year old boy. Jackpot baby. Mary pushed aside the brush next to the tree to reveal an old overgrown trail leading deeper into the woods.

“Okay. Promise me you won’t get carried away. We need to be back here sooner rather than later. I really don’t want to be stuck out here at night.” I said as Mary began to push her way through the foliage, practically running down the path.

“I promise,” she called back. “Loosen up a bit nerd!”

“Yep.” I sighed and followed her deeper into the forest. That was our first mistake.

We walked for what felt like another hour following the old trail through the woods. As we walked I noticed something. These paths must have been still in use by someone, maybe locals or teens who knew it was a good place to drink beer and smoke weed. The trail was well worn into the dirt, like a lot of people had walked this way before but it was much smaller than the main trails. It was only big enough for one person to stand on without going into the ferns on the sides. We had to walk single file one after the other like we were back in elementary school. The other thing was these weird little diamond things. They almost looked like ornaments hanging from the trees, delicately made intricate diamond shapes made out of twigs. On the inside of the diamond was a pattern of different colored yarn going into the center of the diamond. I spotted a few of them off the sides of the trail and hanging above us. Maybe it was to mark that this was still the path to the falls.

Soon we heard what sounded like roaring water from up ahead. Mary ran forward and stopped at the top of the small hill we were climbing up. She turned and smiled.

“We found it,” she yelled. “Hurry up. It’s really beautiful!”

I clambered up the hill. Panting as the slope got steeper with each step. I had no clue how Mary ran up this thing. After a minute I joined her at the top and we looked down at the falls. It was as pretty as she said. A small outcropping where a river on the opposite side of the hill flowed down into a small pond below and continued through the divot into a new stream. If we wanted to get down there we had to do a sort of spiral downward making our way slowly down the sloping ground.

“Come on, let's go!” Mary said, pulling on my arm. That’s when the ground beneath us gave way. The soft dirt below our feet shifted. There was a layer of small rocks that shifted beneath our combined weight and began to roll down the hill towards the falls. Mary fell first. She was further forward than me. I tried to hold on but her pulling on me for support made me slip too. We both went down. Tumbling head over heels, the world turned around me like I was in a washing machine. I heard her scream out and her hand left mine and then it was black.

I woke up a few minutes ago next to the falls. My leg really hurts, I don’t know if I sprained it or broke the bone but I don’t see anything sticking out or in the wrong place. My hair is coated in sticky blood. A gash on the back of my head. The worst thing, Mary is nowhere in sight and the sun is starting to go down.

Entry 2

I’ve been looking around for a bit now and I don’t know where she went. I tried crawling back up to the top of the hill where we had fallen and looking around but I haven’t seen anything. We fell and from the second I hit my head everything felt different, like all the bright sounds and colors drained from the world around me. There are no birds around anymore, their chirps and whistles have gone silent. The blooming flowers are wilting, careening towards the ground in a macabre nose dive. Even the winds rustling through the leaves have gone still, only the rushing sounds of the falls behind me and every once and a while a loud crunch, like stepping on dead leaves.

At least my head stopped bleeding meaning that it couldn’t have been too deep, right? My leg hasn’t improved at all, so I fashioned a walking stick out of one of the fallen branches near me, it’s sturdy, it’ll hold my weight. I've been calling for Mary, making my voice hoarse as I scream. I can only wonder what’s happened to her. We shouldn’t be that far apart from each other and she should hear me. What if she hit her head too but it was much worse and she’s already bled out and I’ll never see her again because I was too slow to find her body. My heart is pounding. Ba dump ba dump ba dump in my chest, faster and faster until I spiral further and further down into the pit. I don’t have my emergency meds on me. Fuck. Why did I leave them in the car? Fucking idiot. Now Mary’s lost, alone and maybe even dead and you are acting like a complete fucking child. Dad would have never done this to mom if they were lost. Get up and find her. No matter what. Deep Breaths. Find Mary. Find Mary. FIND MARY.

Entry 3

I’ve been using the little light I have left to try and look for any clues where Mary could have gone but I have found nothing. It’s like she slipped into another world when we fell and I can’t even see any evidence of the trail back to the car anymore. The sun keeps dipping lower and lower through the trees, the light getting less and less. Idiot. Why didn’t you check your phone battery before we came out here? Everything else except the one fucking thing that could have saved you. I could have sworn it was full when we pulled in but who knows, everything is so hazy from this morning. I’ve been trying to stay near the falls but I think I need to try and find my way back towards the car. If I can do that then I can charge my phone and call for help. I hate the idea of leaving without Mary, knowing it’s at least a two hour walk back to the lot and she could be injured or worse. I need to get back, I need to save us.

Entry 4

I heard something in the woods. I’ve been trying to follow the path we came from but it’s just gone. Vanished. Poof. But I have this odd sensation that something is watching me from behind the trees. Like every time I step, something else takes a step, trying to mask itself. I don’t know, maybe it’s the combination of the concussion I’m sure I have and the panic attacks but I don’t feel right. These woods don’t feel right.. I keep hearing what I think is whispering. Like it is just under the wind, a hint of words I know? My head is just filling in the blanks where it wants, making me more paranoid than I need to be right now. I need to focus. Get out and calm for help. Go. Don’t look back, no matter what you hear Jamie. Keep moving forward, it’s all in your head anyway. God I hope it’s all in my head.

Entry 5

There is definitely something following me. Loud piercing sounds like branches cracking in half cut through the silent air as I keep moving further and further into the forest. I swear the forest feels like it’s alive. Swaying with each step, the moss on the ground moves up to engulf my feet as I trek further and further into unknown territory. I’ve long left the falls now. I was hoping that by some grace of god I could use the sun to help find my way back the way we came. I know it was on the left of me when we pulled into the parking lot. I remember Mary saying something about the glare.

“Move your visor over,” she grunted with the sun in her eyes. “I can’t see.”

The sun is on the right hand side of me now so if I keep it to the right and keep moving hopefully I can still find the trails that lead back.

Shit. There it was again. The crack, a dry branch splitting in half, sending splinters through the air. And the feeling of being watched is worse now. I feel like every time I look at a tree I should see a face poking around the side, waiting for me to stumble into its trap. It’s unnerving. The sun getting lower and lower is not helping the unease at all. It must be around 7 pm now. The sun has been setting around 7:30 recently so I really don’t have that much light left. Good thing I still have my flashlight even if I’m fucking terrified to be out here in the dark. Maybe I should try and stop for the night, wait out the dark and start my trek again in the morning.

Crack. There it is again. A snap, a thud, a rustle in the trees and that incessant feeling of eyes boring into the back of my head at all times. I really don’t like this.

There’s a little outcropping a few feet away from me. A tree fell and the roots came with it making a sort of hole I can slip into. It has a cover and maybe I can get some sleep and rest my leg, it still really hurts. Hopefully morning comes quickly.

Entry 6

I heard her. It was definitely her. She was calling my name out in the darkness. Her voice was far away and hoarse but it was her, Mary.

“Jamie!” She yelled, startling me from a restless sleep. “Help-“ Then her voice went silent.

I immediately got up from my sleeping position within the alcove. It had started to rain during the night, a cold whipping wind blowing the drops every which way.

“Jam…”

“….You”

“He….”

Fragments of words I know Mary is saying in the darkness. She sounds so far away though. I tried calling back, yelling for her in the dark but with each scream she got further and further away. The wind picking up, the rain pelting through the trees, hitting the leaves on the way down creating a sound like falling glass obscuring her screams. And that cracking, like a bone snapping in two, is getting louder and louder with each second. A low hum is filling the air, something different from the constant sound of rain and wind. Something else, like a deep guttural moan coming from the trees.

My heart is pounding. With each second Mary drifts farther away, but I can’t shake this feeling of dread — like if I follow her voice, both of us are never getting out of here. The rain is pouring harder now, each drop slamming into me like the world demanding I move. It’s so dark, like an abyss swallowing me whole, and my flashlight barely cuts through more than a few feet ahead. I know it’s silly, but ever since we fell, something has been wrong. Something has changed.

Still, I can’t leave her out there alone. Not if there’s even a chance.

I’m going into the dark. I’m finding my fiancée.

Entry 7

I’ve been walking for what feels like hours. The further I go into these accursed woods the clearer she sounds. The rain continues to pelt me as I march forward into the void. I’m cold. Freezing. Soaked to the bone in ice cold water and the wind cuts straight through my body, leaving me shivering as I continue to walk.

But I hear her again. Like a siren calling me to the deep I continue toward her even when I tell my body to stop. Even though I know with every fiber of my being it’s wrong, I just keep moving.

“Hel….help m..m…me, Jamie”

“L…et..s g…o hommm…e”

Her words stutter and twist, shaking, like someone trying to learn to speak for the first time again. It’s wrong. It’s so wrong. A mockery of her perfect voice, but it’s her voice- I’d know it anywhere.

The forest is alive with sound now. The rain, the wind, and that fucking breaking sound.

Crack. Drag. Crack. Drag. Crack. Drag

It’s like someone is pulling a bag behind them, pushing the leaves and debris on the forest floor out of the way with their feet. Each crack gets closer, louder, heavier. With each step it’s like bones breaking under a massive amount of pressure. They are forced to heal and then the pressure breaks them again and the cycle continues. And the air. It reeks of a metallic smell. It’s almost sweet. Like copper and rot.

The trees are close together and they drip. A deep crimson outlines the ground beneath my feet, like a river of blood leading me to my destination. Piles of rotting flesh sit under the trees. They twitch like they remember being alive, trying to cling to whatever life they had before this. The crimson trail leads me deeper into this twisted hellscape. I can’t stop now. I have to follow it. I have to know where she is. And then I see it.

The source of the trail leads directly to it. My light reaches forward into the night and lands in a small opening within the trees. There’s a deep heavy labored breathing coming from the outcropping. What lays before me is wrong in every sense of the word.

It’s tall, impossibly tall, nine feet at least. It’s hunched in the dark, perched on broken limbs. Limbs that are too long protrude from the giant's torso. What should be its arms are bent at impossible angles, twisted, broken in places that should never break. Bone rips through its tissue paper skin like nothing, a deep red pouring from the festering wounds. Its legs are the same broken and disfigured beyond recognition. It moves ever so slightly, twitching but with each movement the sound comes back- crack crack crack- the sound of broken bones.

The flashlight shakes violently in my hands and I continue to trace over the creature's appearance. My light lands on its head. A large buck skull sits upon its shoulders. It’s cracked and chipped, the antlers imposed into the side of the skull reach toward the sky at odd angles, bending and breaking like jagged spears.

Then I see why it’s perched like that. Before it lays a body. Overshadowed by the grotesque caricature that stands before it

\\- Mary.

She’s on the ground, covered in blood from head to toe but she’s breathing.

The creature shifts again, positioning itself directly over Mary’s head, each movement a cacophony of injuries. Then the low hum starts. The one I heard in the woods before. The creature begins to shake as its chest begins to push outward. First slowly, thump, thump thump until there's a split. A sound like raw meat hitting the kitchen floor erupts forth as the chest of the beast cracks open, its ribs split wide and create a deep wound from within itself. As its chest bursts open, several small tendril-like protrusions fall toward Mary. The finger-like invaders place themselves deep within Mary’s soft face and begin to pulse. Every time they pulse, her voice gets clearer, stronger. The siren call gets louder and harder to resist.

“Jamie….”

It’s pitch was too low, like a tape that had been slowed down. Pulse.

“Jamie….”

“My….lo..”

Another pulse.

“My love…”

Pulse.

“Jamie, let’s go home…”

The creature leans in, tilting its skull toward her. Listening, learning. It’s getting better, close to her.

I can’t breathe. My mind is going a mile a minute. I step back, try and catch my breath. Just one step.

Snap.

The sound echoes through the trees.

The creature stops. The light catches in its hollow eyes.

Then it screams — a thousand voices tearing through the woods, human and not.

I drop the light.

And run.

Entry 8

This is it. My final moments on this earth. I know it. I can feel it in my bones, pounding through my veins.

I ran from the shambling monstrosity that I had witnessed in the clearing, dropping my light, my salvation in the dark. My heart was pounding and my brain swimming, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It shouldn’t exist. It shouldn’t be. It was an unholy abomination, something dragged from the deepest depths of hell and thrown into this forest.

It’s dark. Darker than I have ever seen before. I couldn’t see two inches in front of my face but yet I still ran as fast as I could. I’m a coward. I know this. I’ve always been. Dad would be so disappointed. I left Mary back there, clearly in need of help. You are a fucking coward ands that’s how you’ll die.

The last image I saw will haunt me for what small time I have left. As the light slipped from my hand the beam fell upon the creature's chest. The gaping open wound where those tendrils had poured out of. It was the gates of hell. There were maybe 10 fleshy and twisted faces embedded within the carrion of its chest. They were all different but most of them seemed to be women, twisted, their flesh merging together into one. One stuck out most prominently though. Mary’s face. It was new, barely disfigured but still there among the others. They all screamed, their faces contorted in pain beyond comprehension, tears of blood streaming down the disfigured faces as they wailed in time with the shriek from the buck skull. The sound rattled my bones, my teeth shook and tears immediately welled in my eyes before my legs allowed me to move.

The creature pounded after me, rattling forward on broken hands and feet. I can hear it, snapping the bones as it tears through the woods after me. The deafening hum returns in my brain.

I ran as far and fast as I could. Slamming into tree after tree, maneuvering my way through the dark the best I could before I fell. A root had protruded from the ground and wrapped around my foot, like the forest didn’t want me to escape. At this moment I felt a hot searing pain push through my back.

“Don’t ru…n”

“I’m righ…t he…re honey”

“You’re safe.”

It’s hot rotting breath on the back of my neck as it’s long sharp claw like fingers ripped into my back, pinning me to the ground. I could feel every shudder and twitch of it as it pinned me there, face down in the mud. The rain continued to pelt me as if the sky was weeping.

“It’s over…..now”

It said, changing the pitch of its voice, trying to match Mary’s again.

At this moment all hope was gone and memories of my life flashed before my eyes. My parents house with the dog, sitting on the porch as Dad told terrible stories to make me and Mom laugh. When I proposed to Mary on that snowy afternoon. My Dads funeral and my last conversation with him. It was all flooding back to me now. What would my Mom think happened to me? There one moment and gone the next. She can’t handle any more, this will surely break her. And Mary. If there is any life left in her back there, what was she thinking? My fiancée left me for dead in the woods?

No, I will fight until the end.

The claws pushed deeper into my already bleeding back when I remembered something. My pocket knife. It might not be much but it was something. Quickly I grabbed at the knife in my pocket and slowly flicked it open.

“Be one with us, Jamie”

It whispered, its head right next to my ear.

And in a flash I struck the blade upwards towards anything at my back. Thud, the blade sunk acceptingly into wet flesh.

The creature cried out and shook violently. Its grip on me lessened for a moment, one moment of action that I could seize.

I crawled forward, picking myself up through the pain. The pain in my leg, in my head and now in my back and I began to run again. I ran through trees, through bushes and thickets, getting my jacket caught in a tangle of branches. I ran until my eyes saw light, a single shred of moonlight breaking through the thick clouds and the trees. I ran until my feet left the ground and I fell again.

This is where I now lay. My leg is broken this time, the bone jutting outward in a sickening angle. The pain is excruciating, I can’t move without wanting to vomit. There is no way I can put any pressure on this to love. And to put the cherry on top, I’m trapped. Trapped against a giant rock that’s blocking my path, so I sit here. Using my remaining time to write my final thoughts. I can hear it moving through the trees faster now. Careening towards me like a run away train.

Mom I’m sorry you will probably never know what happened to me. I wish I was a better son, there for you more instead of curling into myself when Dad died.

Dad, I’m sorry I couldn’t be more of a man to protect what I loved.

And Mary I’m sorry I couldn’t be the partner you needed. I’m sorry I couldn’t get over all of my issues to value you more. You needed someone better than me and this is where it led you.

If anyone is reading this do not go into Greyveil. Do not go for that day hike into the forest. The forest is alive here and it will do everything in its power to never let you leave again.

End of Entries.

At the current moment the search for Jamie Trenches remains are still under investigation. Greyveil National Park has been closed until further notice. No one is allowed inside the forest.

I just feel like a failure,"6 months ago my ex (F25 now F26) accused me of cheating (M24 now 25) because I accepted a friend request on Snapchat of someone I vaguely knew. I didn’t know what she wanted. We just had a brief catchup convo (I never went out with this person or was on any romantic stage with her). The very first thing I stated was I had a gf and she asked how we met. As I was replying my ex looked over my shoulder and asked who it was. I told her honestly who it was. She didn’t say anything about it as we just continued hanging out that day at the beach. 2 days later she expressed her discomfort with it so I unadded that person, apologized and reassured her and said that’s a reasonable thing to ask. We’re both being reasonable.

This is where it all went downhill. I thought we had it handled. The replies got shorter and shorter. A few days after the Snapchat situation occurred from the beach. I had some poisoning and that weekend since we both still live at home, I got asked to mow the lawn, but I also didn’t anticipate getting some poisoning so I couldn’t. My mom got home from a vacation and she was visibly upset that I didn’t mow the lawn, but I was also in constant communication with they were saying I would mow it later that week on Tuesday when I get off from work because I would most likely feel better from the sun poison. I told my ex that and she went off on me about how keeping my word was important to her and that I broke my word to my mom. My response to that was I agree with that, but there’s much bigger things to be this worked up about and that it’s just the lawn and it’s not like I broke my word to a bigger responsibility like helping somebody out with something more important.

Since I’m an engineer and work at a power plant, it was 9 PM mid argument and I just fell asleep because I was so tired. I woke up at 4 AM for work and I had to get to work as soon as I got in because we were busy, so I wasn’t able to text my ex until my break at 11 AM the next day she said I Stonewater and put up a brick wall for 14 hours from 9 PM to 11 AM and then I just ignored her. I texted her at 11 AM and then at 2 PM and then again at 6 PM cuz at that point she was ignoring me. The text I sent at 6 pm was one I would’ve like to receive from her “my day was good I was grading papers as the kids watched a movie” and she replied an hour later that we needed to talk the next day because I ignored her.  the next day she broke up with me because she thought I was cheating on her with the whole Snapchat situation and that she said what if I asked you to mow the lawn and you don’t do it. Her single friends she talk to you about this and her married friends and her married sister both of those groups said different things. The married friends and sister told her she should stay with me while the single friends told her to leave. (We were together 5 months)

A week later, we met up at a coffee shop to talk where I read her the note I poured my heart and sole into. And took full accountability for what had happened and I told her I would never add anybody back again, and I didn’t know this would be so catastrophic to end a relationship. Both times in the car and at the coffee shop. She said she would’ve married me. The only reason why I got the coffee shop meet up was because the time span from her breaking up with me in the car and the coffee shop talk a week later I sent her three text messages and the fourth one was me asking if she was serious about the marriage thing. Where she said, yes I was serious. I thought the talk went well, but she said before we even started talking that this does not mean we’re getting back together today. But after the talk, she said we can go out to dinner and talk slowly from there on out that ultimately didn’t happen as I wished her a happy fourth of July and asked her holiday one and she never got back to me 11 days later, and after she drunk, called me after a concert I texted her for our dinner. Where she said, she ultimately needed a time and his face to heal, but she wish she was ready, but she felt like I didn’t give her the space. She said she needed. I texted her a week later after she said that to me, leaving the door open and thanking her for our time together and that you know how I feel about her and if she ever wants to continue with us, she can reach out to me and I also let her know what I was going to be doing. It’s been six months and I haven’t heard from her since she ghosted me. This whole thing really messed me up mentally I would never ever cheat on anybody. That’s not how I was raised, and that accusation really fucked me up and what she did to string me along too. My therapist my family and friends have all said that this was not something that should’ve caused a break up and that it wasn’t even a big problem but I still have a hard time seeing it and I really just feel like I fucked up so badly. I just feel like I lost the best thing ever happened to me. She projected the four years of abuse she went through from the person before me as well as the cheating stuff because she did go through a whole lot of physical and emotional abuse from that person.

But also, my therapist said that when she said to me during the coffee shop talk was completely out of line as she said I needed to be a better son, and when I expressed to her that I was wanting to go to college to set an example for my future kids on how you could do anything you say your mind to being that I just got out of the Navy after five years and then I wanted to change careers from being an engineer to teaching. She questioned if I could raise a family go to school full-time and work full-time doing that and she said she didn’t think I could. She also called me lazy too. I just never heard from her again and it hurts because she was my first serious relationship and she was everything I was looking for morally and value wise, we clicked on the bigger picture items that we both wanted, but to end it over me accepting a friend request because she didn’t know what I talked about with this person after I treated her so great  I can’t wrap my head around it and can’t stop blaming myself. I also had to cancel a vacation because of this that I had planned later on in that summer. Everyone has said I dodged a bullet & didnt do anything wrong but I can’t seem to think so.

1pzty1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1pzty1b/his_entire_family_lacks_boundaries/,His entire family lacks boundaries,"My husband is diagnosed with BPD but his entire family is toxic. 

He badmouthed his mother to me early on, and said she was cold and detached. He seemed to hate her. But then he switched up and started defending her against any percieved slights I'd made against her. His entire attitude towards her changed. He started to threaten me with her during arguments and disagreements, and actually going to her during some of them and completely twisting the faces to make himself look like a victim. She sided with him right away and never tried to hear my side. 

I spoke up, told her what he was doing which was abusive, and she didn't respond. She started involving herself in arguments coming to the door, telling me to leave him alone. Always assuming I was the one causing things. His brother, as a teenager, took things off him like his phone charger and they got into a psychical fight over his refusal to give it back, according to my husband. He took his mattress, swapping it out with his own. He wasn't held accountable for any of this by either of his parents. 

As time went on, he continued to do things, taking my husband's car without permission and damaging it. Again, no consequences. My husband rarely confronted him, going through his mother instead, who also didn't confront him. His brother has OCD, supposedly, and throws things out he thinks aren't being used or are in the way, throwing away good items in the process. My husband insisted on putting my Nespresso coffee machine downstairs months ago, and I told him not to, that his brother or someone would throw it away. 

He assured me that wouldn't happen, and it did. We assumed it was his brother right away. He went to his mother, who denied ever seeing the coffee machine that had sat there for a week or two. That was until the next day when she admitted she told his brother to take it to junk yard, and that she thought it was left there to be tossed. She said she was too scared to say it before that because my husband was angry. My husband condemed this but, at the same time, rationalized and downplayed it by saying the coffee machine was dirty and it was a genuine mistake, though he agreed she should've asked first. 

he acted like I was overreacting being as upset as I was and not letting it go. He also felt he had no part in it and was being unnecessarily criticized. She offered me a laptop, a cheap one, to sell and get money back. One that I believe she's been trying, or intending to list for sell, but hasn't. Then there's his father. He told me that he would take things, like his ps3 for example, and gift it to children nearby as kind gesture. He offered money to us at times, but many of his offers dont come to be. He has random mood swings, and has psychs where he will go around loudly swearing for ages. 

It bothers him, and his mother, and they call him crazy and various other things. She confides in my husband a lot about his father. I believe she over shares and it crosses into emotional insect considering he gets really uncomfortable, and complains about it. He told me one time his father cheated on his mother, but now says he doesn't know, and doesn't like to talk about it. He claims he abused him and his mother when he was growing up, and that he is a terrible person. That he hates him. At the same time, he feels sorry for him, and says how alone he is. 

He says he feels bad for him because he has no one, because his mother ignores him. But he flips and says the opposite after he's done something. He's become increasingly uncomfortable around him as time has gone on. He's always worried, and waiting, to hear him complain and insult him in some way. If a dish isn't cleaned, if something irritates him, he anticipates his dad going off and calling him a c*nt over it. He now tries to be as quiet as possible when he's around, at night especially, and tells me his dad is bothered when it doesn't appear that he is. 

I asked today if we could put pizza we got downstairs and he said he didn't know, that his dad could eat it. He said before he can't tell his dad not to eat something because he will do it anyways, or snap at him, or forget. It's crazy. The strangest part of all of this is that he dislikes his family so much, speaks badly of them, but doesn't like me doing the same. He uses the fact I live here for free, and they've been nice to me, to try and stop me. He seems offended when I complain about them, even when it's things he's said himself. I called his dad abusive before and he didn't like that though he says he's abusive. ",1,1767129212.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

Since Christmas, while I've been waiting for some freshly roasted beans to come in from my favorite coffee shop, I've been brewing shots with the remnants of some old Invader Coffee beans we had.

Every single shot has been unbelievably sour.  The Baratza ESP Pro has a grind range of 60(full course) to 0(full fine)  I started at 19, and have been working my way down.  My most recent shot was ground at 6.0 and is still incredibly sour.

The process I've been using is:  
 \* Measure and grind 18gr of beans  
 \* While those are grinding, I'm running a shot of hot water through the filter, and into my cup  
 \* Putting the coffee into my then dried filter, using a WDT tool  
 \* Tamping the espresso with a level  
 \* Insert filter into machine, scale under cup, tare the scale.  
 \* Press and hold the double shot button for 7 seconds.  
 \* Time starts when the scale detects the weight change  
 \* Stop the brew at 30gr which finalizes at \~ 32gr

The brew time has never been more than like 24 seconds, which seems fast, and I think that's why my coffee is coming out so sour, but I don't have a lot more adjustment on my grinder settings.

1pzttty,https://llclick.com/b72ssccb/,Online Marketing: The Smart Way to Build a Business,"When Jordan first stumbled across the idea of online marketing, it happened late at night, after another exhausting day at work. Scrolling aimlessly, Jordan noticed stories of ordinary people building businesses from laptops, coffee shops, and spare bedrooms. It sounded unrealistic, but something about it sparked hope that refused to fade.

At first, online marketing felt overwhelming. There were unfamiliar terms, endless strategies, and opinions pointing in every direction. Jordan quickly learned that success did not come from knowing everything, but from starting imperfectly. The first lesson was simple: online marketing is about people, not platforms. Behind every click is a human looking for answers.

Jordan began by sharing small pieces of helpful content. Some posts were ignored. Others received unexpected responses. Each interaction proved that value mattered more than perfection. Slowly, confidence grew, and so did curiosity about what worked and why.

Traffic became the next challenge. Jordan learned that visibility is the heartbeat of any online business. Without traffic, even the best ideas remain invisible. By experimenting with social media, basic search optimization, and short videos, Jordan discovered that consistency mattered more than viral moments.

Then came the breakthrough of list building. Instead of relying on borrowed platforms, Jordan started building an email list. It felt strange at first, but soon it became empowering. An email list meant ownership, stability, and direct connection. Over time, strangers turned into subscribers, and subscribers turned into loyal readers.

Content evolved alongside experience. Jordan stopped trying to impress and focused on being real. Stories replaced sales pitches. Lessons replaced hype. People responded because honesty builds trust faster than flashy promises ever could.

Monetization followed naturally. Jordan recommended tools that genuinely helped along the journey. Affiliate links became bridges, not barriers. Income arrived inconsistently at first, then steadily. The realization was powerful: online marketing rewards patience and alignment.

Automation transformed everything. Simple systems handled follow-ups, delivered content, and nurtured relationships automatically. For the first time, effort was no longer chained to hours. Work done once continued producing results long after it was finished.

There were setbacks, of course. Doubt crept in during quiet weeks. Comparison threatened motivation. But each obstacle strengthened resilience. Jordan learned that online marketing success belongs to those who stay committed when results lag behind effort.

Over time, freedom became real. Freedom to choose when to work, what to promote, and how to grow. Online marketing did not eliminate challenges, but it replaced limits with options.

Today, Jordan sees online marketing as more than a business model. It is a skill, a mindset, and a long-term asset. It proves that ordinary people can build extraordinary outcomes by serving others consistently.

Online marketing remains one of the smartest ways to build a business in the digital age. It requires learning, courage, and persistence, but it offers leverage, reach, and opportunity unlike anything before. For those willing to begin, the journey can change everything.

Jordan also discovered that mindset played a hidden but powerful role. Early mornings were no longer rushed; they became moments of learning and reflection. Small daily actions stacked into visible progress. Instead of chasing quick wins, Jordan focused on building skills that would last for years. That shift removed pressure and replaced it with purpose.

Community became another turning point. Connecting with other marketers revealed that struggles were normal, not personal failures. Shared lessons shortened the learning curve and restored motivation during difficult stretches. Collaboration replaced competition, and growth accelerated naturally.

Most importantly, Jordan learned to measure success differently. Progress was no longer defined only by income, but by confidence, clarity, and control. Online marketing became a path toward self-belief. Each published post, each email sent, and each lesson learned reinforced the idea that growth happens through action.

Looking back, Jordan realized the decision to start was the most important step. Everything else followed from that moment of courage. Online marketing did not promise certainty, but it offered possibility. And possibility is all someone needs.",1,1767128926.0,DigitalMarketingHack,0,1.0,False

We bonded and found out that both of us live minutes away from each other in Hong Kong, and we had pretty deep chemistry between us (no physical or anything, but the type you can feel just through deep eye contact and conversation if that makes sense. Very heart to heart). We said we would definitely hang out in Hong Kong together over winter break since it's such an insane coincidence we live minutes away from each other. We followed each other on insta that night as well. We exchanged two deep hugs that night. 

Fast forward, he is now back with the person he broke up with. besides some insta story likes here and there, no communication until two weeks ago when we were both back for break. He posted a pic of Hong Kong on his story so I swiped up and said I was back in town too. We chatted for about an hour or so, discussing how I should meet up and hang out with him and his gf who is visiting. I was very down!

He followed up with me about a week later letting me know he was free. My plans changed, where I had to leave earlier than expected, so I told him I would only be free the next day. He said he would be free, so we scheduled a 1-1 hangout. It was super nice, we got to know each other more through coffee and we walked around chatting while also window shopping. We both were super comfortable to share personal life stories and details and our convos were super natural :) However - the tension between us was real. It's hard to put in words.. but it felt like unresolved chemistry between us since he was single when we met. He called me beautiful, dropped compliments here and there about my personality, and overall just a sweet gentleman. He even told me about some of the bumps he's having with his gf, not like in an advising way but just sharing how he is nervous about their future post-college and even telling me how he was not with her when we met (he didn't know that I knew he was broken up, my friend told me). He also told me he wished I could stay longer and said he would've taken me to a lounge he really liked with nice drinks. He walked me home, and we exchanged two very deep hugs, how it was when we first met. And the kind where you want it to continue and he hugs tighter at the end. We also exchanged phone numbers and said we would see each other again when we're both back in town from Hong Kong. Finally, seconds after we departed, he adds me to his close friends on instagram. I follow him on my private insta and he follows back. More social media engagement between us followed as well (insta likes, messages etc). This happened a couple days ago btw. 

While i am fully aware that he's not available, I am feeling a bit wrapped up about my emotions with him. I think there's clearly something there, and if he weren't unavailable, then both of us would probably act. I guess, based on his behavior, is it possible he's considering me as a backup option? I am confused why he would be dropping compliments when he's taken and i'm curious if he even told his gf that he hung out with me 1-1. While I don't think he's a red flag, I am wondering if he even realizes his behavior and if he is, then is it intentional? Chances that it's just to use me as an ego booster for fun, and not consider me seriously?  Obviously if he ends it with his gf again, and makes a move on me, then i know the answer. I know I sound delusional, but I want a surface level perspective! Ty for reading this:)",1,1767128855.0,Crushes,10,1.0,False

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added: “Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed where I was from and when I asked how he knew, he replied: “May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year. He has completed his masters in education.

Only he has been the one initiating contact and suggesting meeting up.

So I’m confused, does this sound like someone just being friendly and social, or someone who’s low-key interested but trying to keep it chill? Also I think it is really weird for anyone to reach out to someone like this and I think when a random guy slides into a girl’s DMs, it didn’t always seem 100% platonic.",1,1767128814.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

    INT. DELI - DAY

    Lunch hour; fairly busy with filled tables.

    A WAITRESS arrives at a table where SCOTT (mid-20s), sits - eyes vacant. He wears an Autumnal sweater-over-shirt combo, neat and considered. 

    WAITRESS

    Two lattes, one oat milk?

    Scott snaps out of his thousand-yard stare.

    SCOTT

    Oh yeah uh, the oat milk's gonna be for her.

    The waitress smiles and puts both coffees down then walks away hurriedly.

    ALLIE

    Scott. Hi! Look at you!

    He slowly tilts up to see ALLIE (mid-20s) smiling down. She is wearing bold primary colours and possesses a frizz of unruly hair.

    Scott jolts up and comes face to face with Allie.

    SCOTT

    Allie. It's good to see you, thanks for coming.

    The two share a hug - the kind of hug you have where both of you pat each other’s backs like you’re burping a baby...

    ...or the kind where a bystander whispers 'Oh they used to 
    date
    '.

    They separate, sharing a brief smile.

    SCOTT

    I got you an oat milk latte, that still right?

    They both settle into opposite chairs.

    ALLIE

    Yeah yeah, that's... that's still right. Thanks. You could of really messed my stomach up.

    SCOTT (correcting)

    Could have. Sorry, I don't know why I said that.



    Painful silence.

    A LADY behind Scott reads a GQ magazine. Allie starts to squint her eyes at it, before Scott snaps her out of it.

    SCOTT

    So... How're you doing then?

    ALLIE

    Umm... I mean I'm good. I was a bit surprised when you wanted to meet up out of the blue though.

    SCOTT

    (shrugging shoulders)

    I guess I was just curious to see how you were.

    ALLIE

    Honestly, I thought it was a butt-dial at first.

    They both chuckle.



    SCOTT

    What've you been up to since we...

    ALLIE

    So what have you been--

    They laugh. Allie gestures for Scott to go first. He adjusts his collar, caught up in nerves.

    SCOTT

    What have you been doing?

    ALLIE

    Well, I've recently started an online travel business.

    SCOTT (polite)

    Hey that's great. I just sold my business funnily enough.

    Allie forces herself to nod and forges a smile.

    ALLIE

    That's... amazing. That's really great.
     
    What about that other finance business? Novel Money was it?

    Scott's face tightens.

    SCOTT

    Novus Wealth. And it was private equity. 

    (while sipping)

    And I sold that one too.

    ALLIE

    Oh yeah? I run my travel business but it's in its early stages. I ditched everything and lived out a 30-litre backpack for 6 months - finally hit Morocco like we talked about doing. It was heaven.

    SCOTT

    Did you uh... go with anyone? From here, or anyone we know?

    ALLIE

    Umm... no.

    (pause, reconsidering)

    I tell a lie, I did go with someone, but not someone you'd know.

    SCOTT

    Who's that then?

    ALLIE

    I went with a guy. A really tall guy. A model. He was on the cover of GQ once.

    INT. DELI - DAY

    Scott firmly places his mug on the table, and Allie gives a patronising over-smile.

    The cover of the GQ magazine in the background has changed - it now shows the handsome man from Allie's story.

    SCOTT

    How'd you meet him?

    Allie's eyes dart around a bit.

    ALLIE

    Just around. What about you, have you done much travelling?

    SCOTT

    I went to Everest. To the very top. On my own.

    ALLIE

    That's not really your thing, is it? 

    Scott now sits, buried in full mountaineering gear.

    SCOTT

    Well I did, alright?

    The TV behind Allie blares a news story of Scott - headline reading: 'MAN CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST'. 

    ALLIE

    Oh, last month I ran the Hackney Half.

    SCOTT

    Cool. I did the London Marathon. For charity.

    A gold medal manifests on him.

    ALLIE

    Really? Gold?

    Scott's eyes dart around manically. The medal breaks off from around Scott's necks and crashes on the floor.

    The world around them grows quieter as the exes bicker. 

    ALLIE

    I've actually been doing some charity work as well. I...

    (looks into distance)

    volunteer at a lion sanctuary.

    SCOTT

    Oh do you now?

    ALLIE

    Yes.

    Allie holds her arm up and it is covered in a huge scar as if a lion clawed her.

    Scott stares, confused, but too caught up in it all to worry.

    SCOTT

    Charity? I built a hospital in Uganda.

    JUMP CUT TO:

    Scott cuts a ribbon outside a hospital, surrounded by Ugandan citizens.

    SCOTT (V.O.)

    Scott now has a large badge on his sweater reading 'UGANDAN MAN OF THE PEOPLE AWARD'.

    Sure sure. I've built things too. Like...

    Allie's posture stiffens.

    ALLIE

    ...like this deli! My plaque's on the wall.

    Her plaque is actually on the wall.

    Scott doesn't even look confused anymore, he simply shrugs it off.

    The deli around them fades into obscurity - lights flicker, the ground starts to shake and all movement halts.

    SCOTT

    At least I'm fully self-sufficient. I've learned to be happy on my own. I don't even think about you anymore!

    ALLIE

    Good for you, neither do I! I'm married actually so no need to worry about it.

    SCOTT

    I lied too, I'm also married... to Megan Fox.

    ALLIE

    Now you're being ridiculous! And I'm married to... to...

    (EXHALES)

    Windows smash.

    Lights ping out.

    Only Scott and Allie remain in the abyss.

    They kept pretending they were fine, but the world collapses under the lies.

    Allie and Scott both sit back in their chairs in relief - things snap to a bit of normalcy around them, the deli as it was.

    ALLIE (heavY BREATHING)

    Let's just quit it. No more bullshit. Tell me how you actually feel. Why did you ask to meet me?

    Scott scoffs and smiles.

    SCOTT

    I don't know...

    ALLIE

    And why are you lying?

    SCOTT

    You're right, I'm sorry for being so competitive.

    ALLIE

    We both always were.

    SCOTT

    I didn't build a hospital in Uganda.

    SCOTT

    I didn't climb Everest either.

    His Everest clothes are suddenly gone, and his badge pops off his jumper

    ALLIE

    That's okay. I did go to Morocco. But it wasn't exactly how you might've imagined.

    JUMP CUT TO:

    EXT. DESERT - DAY

    Allie and her handsome boyfriend limp through the Moroccan desert.

    ALLIE (V.O.)

    And there was no tall GQ model.

    The guy blips out of the scene, leaving only Allie trekking the sandy terrain.

    JUMP CUT BACK TO:

    INT. DELI - DAY

    Scott takes a penultimate sip of his coffee.

    SCOTT

    You always used to say I was too honest, now look at me; lying just to 'win the breakup'. I should've handled this better, and I should've handled us better. We were too...

    ALLIE

    Different.

    SCOTT

    And competitive.

    ALLIE

    Some things never change, right? So why'd you ask to meet me?

    SCOTT

    After we broke up a couple years back, I focused on myself for a while - then I looked around and realised that there isn't much I'm actually proud of, no actual achievements. When your profile came up I felt a little haunted I'm not gonna lie, but it brought a lot of great emotions back too.

    Allie gives a genuine smile.

    SCOTT

    I think remembering the breakup made me face a few uncomfortable truths about where I am now.
     
    I'm sorry for how abruptly I ended things and cut you off, and how argumentative I could be sometimes.

    ALLIE

    Thank you. I appreciate that. And I want to apologise a bit as well for how I've acted, and how cut-throat I used to be. You told me when we broke up that I was too much for you, but I'm always gonna be...

    SCOTT

    Colourful.

    ALLIE

    I'll take that. But that's just me.

    SCOTT

    I know, and I shouldn't have treated it that like it was a bad thing.

    ALLIE

    That means a lot. And I wanted to come here today and show you that I'm better than ever, even though I haven't been great either, but that was silly. I wanted to prove, more to myself than anything, that my life has been so unbelievably amazing. I think I realised I needed a bit of closure. 

    SCOTT

    And?

    ALLIE

    I don't know. I think I got a bit of what I needed.

    Scott nods.

    SCOTT

    I guess we're just different people, right?

    ALLIE (affirm)

    Right.

    SCOTT

    And that's okay.

    ALLIE

    Of course it's okay. I've always been glad we were together, Scott. Even if it did end a bit shit. I'm glad you see that now as well.

    SCOTT

    Me too.

    Finally peace between them.

    SCOTT

    I did have one burning question: do we want food?

    ALLIE

    I could eat.

    Both laugh to each other.

    Scott takes one last sip of his coffee and places it on the table - both mugs are empty, both of them have a weight lifted.

    They keep chatting as their voices fade.

    EXT. DELI - DAY

    A sign in the window - 'NEW

    The sign morphs - 'NEW

I want to start by saying that I have not smoked weed (still use nicotine ONLY) since near the end of August (over 4 months). When i google my own personal problems, Reddit always has people that have already posted within 1-10 years ago that strongly relate to how I feel about myself. However, I have never seen a situation quite like mine (definitely not exactly / to a T) but Reddit advice/comments have helped me, so I would appreciate any advice moving forward as it certainly can't hurt.

So, back in 2019, I was turning 27 that summer in August and always weirdly felt like I could end up in the ""27 Club"" (die at 27 years old). Or just die early in general. Dying early was never a real, obsessive, consistent feeling like it will happen any day, but something that just felt intuitive, especially when I was going to bed or alone to my thoughts.

I was addicted (seriously, full-on addicted) to weed, bud, marijuana, pot, or whatever you want to call it, since 2010/2011. I've read so many things that you cannot get addicted to weed - but you 100% can, as I am real-life proof. I believe you can really get addicted to anything, not just drugs, but especially drugs / any substance or action that triggers the brain to operate a different way.

During my genuine weed addiction from 2011-2025, I also smoked tobacco or vaped nicotine (tobacco when smoked, nicotine when vaped) every day / consistently. I was addicted to both weed and nicotine since 2014. 

In 2015, I started vaping using Juul, before ever having a true tobacco/nicotine addiction - but easily shut down any use of tobacco once i started Juul (I primarily used tobacco to *conserve* my weed from 2010-2014) although the nicotine buzz/addiction was still strong the more I used it. I tended to vape / use nicotine during work, at my fast-paced advertising job in NYC, then would smoke weed when I would get home for multiple hours in the P.M. (sometimes in the A.M. too).

I never did any other drugs - just weed and nicotine - for years. And felt like a superhuman at times with it. Not just working, or living a regular life walking down the street, but also even going to the gym stoned, or doing anything stoned / on both - I felt like all my power was in the mind, and that weed doesn't make me sleepy/lazy - it literally does the opposite - makes me feel somewhat superhuman with even more energy when I look for it - then at nighttime, it can put me to bed - again, all in the mind. That worked well for quite a while so I thought.

I'm a huge sports fan and felt like I knew more than most people - I even won over $100K in 1 single night and over $200K in that entire year playing daily fantasy sports back in 2014 (fully on these 2 drugs / stoned at that time) and I felt like I just knew what I was doing in life to succeed. I also lost a ton of money (over $50K easily that year, became addicted the trying to win big again, and was always stoned / on those 2 during those thought processes/times...and I got lucky clearly, but also, was pretty unlucky afterwards in life, without realizing for years - even after stopping my shorter-lived gambling addiction. That didn't stop me from smoking and vaping daily for a decade. I was never full-on addicted to gambling again until 2019, after stopping (sometimes on/off for fun) during around 2016-2018. Once Kobe Bryant died on the day I started back up again in 2020, i stopped immediately and never looked back (same day he died was also when I won over $100K in a night back in 2014).

Without weed in my life, I had trouble sleeping, and also felt like life was so boring (for lack of better word) and weed made life so much more interesting / feel like a movie, sometimes a dream. I was basically somewhat high for my whole life from 2015-early 2020, and I mean that because I would not smoke for hours during work (roughly 8 hours a day sober) but still mentally still felt not 100% sober because of all the weed I smoked from 2010-2014 and during those days/nights in 2015 - if that makes sense.

I used weed as a crutch to help with sleep / slow me down a bit in college from 2010-2014, because I always truly felt like I had adhd or some sort of hyper-awareness that made me more nervous than relaxed in life overall - and the help that came from it with going to sleep (then at the gym nearly every day) transpired to me using weed habitually for every year since 2011 and up to 2025 (although I quit weed cold turkey for a full 6-8 month stint in 2020).

I've always been a cold-turkey quitter, truly - and stopped smoking weed AND nicotine back in 2020 - for several months as mentioned above. I started up again, however in late 2020 after a ""solid' break and it didn't give me bad anxiety - it continued to ""help"" at the time. 

In January 2020, however, that's where everything really changed for me.

Once Kobe died on the day I decided to start back up in gambling (many NBA games got postponed / i lost money that night), my mindset on life was permanently shifted. I grew up a diehard Kobe fan (despite not being a Lakers fan) and having older family members growing up, that were hugeee Kobe fans were the main reason for that. 

The day he died, I started thinking everything in life was scripted / fake / we live in a simulation of some kind. Despite going to a very religious college, I decided that night that God was not real and that basically, we live in Hell. Over the next few weeks, I felt devastated, heartbroken, depressed, in shock - like a key family member died. By the end of January, I was feeling a little better and trying to (daily) use Kobe's words of wisdom as motivation to be the best person I could be - it helped. 

Then Covid began, and i started thinking Kobe's death was related (at the time, if you Google translated Kobe to Hebrew then back to English, you'd get ""covid"" --eery to say the least). I started getting fixated on researching online all about Covid, Kobe, and lots of other things / topics (religion included) that continued the feeling that we live in a fake world simulation of some kind controlled by a higher power of people or higher intelligence - or perhaps God was doing all of this. 

But as I worked in marketing for a decade, it didn't feel natural / organic to me and felt more and more like a simulation every day. I became basically obsessed with a girl at my job during the end of 2019 into 2020, and once Kobe died, i nearly forgot about my ""love"" for her (even though it was purely lust), however once Covid began and I never returned to the office after February 2020, i began to fully lose my mind. 

This next part is hard to understand. I have had some near death experiences in life, but nothing below will talk about that. 

I started a new Instagram account, and based on my feelings about the universe, and feelings about my own personal life, I truly believed that I could have what it takes to change / perhaps ""save"" the world, or at least save myself, and find that lost ""love"" (aka lust) again, by winning this girl over, during 2020, with my intelligence about the world and how it not only relates to my life and how everything and everyone is connected. 

I started posting Instagram pictures every day that I felt were pure art, symbolism, cryptic sometimes, loving sometimes, heaven life sometimes, hell like sometimes, but the pictures all came from my life / taken on my iPhone. I posted over 500 pictures that year on this special IG account, and by the end of 2020, i realized my dream was delusional. From 2019-2020, I had multiple marketing jobs at reputable places (multiple bc of short stints / lost a couple) and by 2021, was looking for a job again living at home with my parents. 

I lived home for over a year and never posted on Instagram again after 2020 - waiting for my big moment where I am ""discovered"" - not in a celebrity / overnight celeb / fame concept, but more that the world would finally be ""ready"" for me to change it / the younger generations would feel as though my instagram is the most impactful instagram account in the world due to the human-ness, spiritual timing, care/thought behind all of the posts.

By 2022, i completely gave up on this entire idea, despite it always still being the back of my mind on a daily basis, and actually archived all 500+ posts on my account - wishing I had never done it (feeling slightly embarrassed but more so feeling delusional / feeling like a dumbass who blew his life away to risk it all on something delusional).

I finally moved out of my parents house that year, after getting a solid-paying new job, making the most money I have ever made at a job in my life, and I was doing pretty well again. I had that job for a little under 2 years.

I then got laid off in 2024, but was able to quickly recover and find a new job that summer. This new job felt special and before i even started on my first day, it weirdly/eerily felt like my entire life was scripted / set up again in some sort of simulation. It was due to the company name (not going to say it, but in a sense, the name of the company and communication by the company was basically informing me (so i thought) that I am a very gifted/special person who has a future in changing the world. I know that sounds ridiculous/hard to fathom, but trust me, it made sense (and still does when I think about everything that transpired once I received the job offer). 

By 2025, I was still working at this new job and doing well - but this was the first time in 5 years that I had to go back to a NYC marketing office and work at an office (all jobs in between were remote). 

I worked at this company for nearly a year, before getting fired - and it was due to me absolutely losing my mind after being fine about 7-8 months in. by 8-9 months in, I started obsessing over the fact that there was a NEW girl at this job/office that I had feelings for - but i wasn't at all obsessing over her. This again is hard to fathom, but basically something triggered me where I started feeling like this was all scripted, everyone was doing everything for my life (and their own lives) but I was given a special mission (I've read about Messiah Complex...) from God to essentially become a person in the world who can help anyone with my instagram account, my words, motivate/inspire others, and end up living a very affluent / successful life with a large family. 

I've never even had a girlfriend in my entire life - I've obsessed over girls before, but nothing like this - where in mid 2025 I became obsessed *again* with the idea that my old ""lost love"" fro 2020 aka lost lust was going to come back to me eventually (she is NOT, i can tell you that). But the new girl at the new job gave me the same feelings, and connections to her life / her name / her parents / the way she talked to me / the way others at work would talk to me - continued to escalate feelings for her. I felt like there were now 2 girls in my life who were trying to ""win"" me in a sense, win my love, even though I didn't even have a single conversation with the first ""lost love/lust"" since the end of 2019/2020...

This new love for the new girl at work caused me to get paranoid and unable to focus on daily work. I felt like everyone at work was trying to trick me / was playing along, trying to confuse me at times - everything felt weirdly connected to myself and God -  I mean everything. Everything talked about /spoken verbally or written at work felt connected to my life / God. Everything felt like I was just waiting for my big moment / reveal that yes - I am right indeed. It was the actual conversations, the work we were doing, everything that corresponded since late 2024 when i took this job, that made me feel that the new girl could actually be the ""one"" and i am ""the one"" - and we need to just find love together and start a new chapter. This was purely deliusional, as you can probably tell / are thinking, but it oddly felt real. 

It felt so real, however, that this caused me to lose my mind at work, and actually told HR people about this and bascially everything. They allowed me to go to therapy paid for my the company. Again, i thought this was all just part of the plan. 

I did 6-8 therapy sessions with 3-4 different therapists, and all of them made me feel more and more delusional/crazy. All of them basically told me I should probably be on some medication and that I am crazy without actually telling me that verbatim (the medication part they did recommend). 

I started smoking more weed during this time than usual - as I was continuing to smoke at a daily level for all of 2024/almost all of 2025 - but once I was fired in the summer from my job (sort of laid off, they gave a 1 month notice and I barely worked for the next month), after expressing all of my thoughts/feelings about everything (even mentioning my instagram account to them), they told me it's over and I need to move on and find a new job. 

I have not had a job since, and I stopped smoking weed about a month after getting fired. After getting fired, weed had started to all of a sudden me insane anxiety - and I began to *hate* smoking weed, hated the way it made me feel - to the point where i pretty easily quit cold turkey in the summer (it's never been that easy but this time it was, despite night sweats daily and some slight irritability). 

I started posting on Instagram again, however about a week after i was fired, because i felt like God was telling me that it's truly time again. And that I need to do more / post more to change the world / make the impact I want to make. I even posted a picture of what looked like a true sign from God - God's face in a sun reflection on a building, that looked unbelievable (not edited at all), and it felt like a true sign from God that I need to take a picture because it was real. 

I remain in fantastic, physical shape and I look 3-7 years younger than I actually am, from what people tell me. I have not smoked weed since the summer. I still use nicotine daily and drink coffee, but that's it as far as substances. 

But I stopped posting on instagram a couple weeks ago - after posting over 400 pictures since the late summer. I posted multiple a day, for most days - sometimes taking a short break (like a week or two), but overall I felt like God was helping me. 

I felt like God was literally helping me post pictures on Instagram - i know it sounds so diabolically delusional, but i am dead serious. I would take 1000's of pictures a day at times, of my daily life, then go and crop/slightly edit to perfect each one before posting - and over a short time, started to realize that every picture posted was aligning / connected to the one prior (based on lines, symmetry, objects, it just was connecting in a way that felt purely unreal / spiritual / out of my control). The connection from pic to pic had me more inspired when I discovered the alignment / connections, so I felt like I was indeed correct about my life and just needed to finish this project. 

I finished in Dec 2025 and not sure if I will even post on instagram again - i may delete every pic one day. I was blocked by not only the first girl i thought i was in love with, but also the second girl from the most recent job. They blocked me on all social media accounts / everything possible and told me to not contact them after I asked them to talk once or twice. 

So now i am blocked by 2 girls, probably thought of as a stalker / full on creep, even though i truly thought my life was made for love with either of them. The second one though, made me feel like love was more real (rather than lust from the first) due to the actual conversations we had, the vibe/connections we had, the time we spent together (literally all during work), but i felt like she was actually in love with me and i started to become in love with her, once I got fired. 

I started to have dreams about her (the second one), and in some of them, she was basically my girlfriend or wife in those, which made me feel like it must be real / it will happen eventually. But after posting so many pictures on instagram (some dedicated purely to her), she blocked me and never looked back / we never spoke again. 

Now I am considering going back to dating apps because i truly am a good looking, smart, normal guy, despite everything i have said above. my family isn't scared of me / doesn't think i'm (that) weird, and they have me babysit their kids sometimes, and ask me to hangout / get drinks sometimes - basically you'd never know i lived this nightmare. 

But i don't have a job, i live home with my parents now (after moving out in 2025 after getting fired, due to having no income coming in), i haven't even had a good / legit job interview in months despite trying / applying to tons of jobs...and due to  living home I've been feeling like a failure, a has-been, a person who risked it all to lose everything good in my life - slightly sad / less motivated about life recently but still working out and eating right daily. the one thing i say to myself these days to keep me going is something like ""well hey, i still look good"" and i refuse to put myself in a position where i look in the mirror and it causes me to feel even worse about myself. 

I feel like it would be good to get myself out there again, and get on a dating app, and try to live a normal life again - despite not having a job. I may wait until I am employed again, but have been starting to think that I should just meet someone and try to ""live a little"" especially since I have been so bored and hate watching TV/movies/shows. I still feel like everything / every media outlet is speaking to me, spiritually. 

I do still feel like everything on tv is trying to tell me / show me that i am still, indeed, right about all of this, and i am indeed ""the one"" / special / gifted / a chosen one of some kind. It also feels delusional at the same time, and feels like I am mentally broken / my brain is broken. So i don't really know what to do.

But overall, i feel as though, if i do find a new job in the next couple of months, then I will get back on that horse and start feeling normal again to an extent. and just put this all in the past / learn from it the best that i can. Since i am not done and won't give up on life, but at the same time, i think about how i'm a failure daily and wish i wasn't living/breathing sometimes on a daily basis. but nothing to the point where i would ever actually harm myself - just daily thoughts especially in the morning or when falling asleep at night. 

I guess i don't even know why i'm posting here / what i am looking for as far as advice - at this point this is just a giant rambling rant and no one probably read it. I put as much context as I could so that it's still readable, but i know - this is all ridiculous and sounds crazy.

But all i can say now is...that if you do read this, any advice would be truly helpful for me right now because I am still feeling confused/lost/hurt by the world on a daily basis. sometimes depressed but never to the point where i would harm myself or do anything to make my life even worse.

1pztmlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nevergrewup/comments/1pztmlq/i_think_i_belong_here/,I think I belong here,"Hi everyoneee!!

so I've kinda always had a bit of a confusing understanding of myself, and over time I've tried multiple understandings of age 'difference' that there could be and couldn't find people that felt similar to me. However, this group feels right?

so a bit of introduction! :3 My name's Cat!! I'm 4-10 but chrono 30, AuDHD, (possibly) am a DID system (therapist believes so), and had a pretty awful chrono-childhood full of a bunch of stuff that I don't want to trigger people with (however it was good in some instances too). But with that said, I kinda have always been in a situation where I never noticed what I was doing or how I was acting mostly? And I've been told that this self reflection is due to newfound safety and escaping my awful situations.

But with this newfound understanding, I've come to realize a few things about myself over the years. I have NEVER felt my chrono-age. Every time I look at people my age/age range, they seem so ""grown-up"" and I just don't feel like that or look like that at all. Like for example, they will show up in sleek black dresses or outfits that look like the cover of a magazine with a bunch of make up and done up hair, and here I am, same age, wearing overalls and my favorite FNAF shirt and carrying my tote covered in mlp/Dandy's World charms carrying my toys to play with outside xD Now to be fair, this has never really bothered me, and I've actually preferred it immensely because I feel those people to be boring and what I'd deem ""old"" and someone I can't talk to easily. I've almost only ever watched a movie or show if it's animated and for kids (soooo rarely watch love action anything), I like kids media, games, properties, and activities vastly more than anything for chrono-adults, I hate alcohol, coffee, etc. because they feel 'older' and they also taste and smell AWFUL, and my bf throws me themed birthday parties with a much younger age on the cake to reflect my feelings. All of this to say that I don't feel distinctly older, nor my chrono-age. In fact, it feels like I've never really 'aged' past a certain set of age ranged interests, ideas, thoughts, and even emotions. Additionally, certain stuff that give the impression of being 'older' in society, like driving/having a license, needing to do taxes, etc. upsets me greatly and I also have immense difficulty doing them. Especially things that are paperwork-y? I have to have others do them for me, and a lot of times I forget the 'impottant dates' or whatever because I don't know what they are and don't particularly care, which is not the best 😭

For a while, I erroniously engaged in communities that I *thought* were people like me, but actually were nsfw activities and the people in those communities largely didn't *feel* the way I do, they just rp'd the idea of being me? This led me to realize that I'm an age regresser, but even there it has a bit of differences. Namely that, while I do have notable shifts when I more obviously regress, my non-regression state is pretty much 'little' me. We have the exact same interests, food preferences, ideas, and actions mostly, with the only difference being my state of mind at the time. And that's what led me here to NGU. Heck, I even asked my therapist and they suggested the way I am is the result of being perma, neurodivergent, and having trauma, so there's that too.

My main reasoning for this post tho is not only to sorta introduce myself (hi btw!! :3), but also get insight into if this feels sorta similar to others in the community? I've heard from some of you that are also on the agere sub, but I was curious about more perspectives and how similar I am to you all! :D",3,1767128429.0,nevergrewup,4,1.0,False

I know there’s a lot of transplants or new to the Bay folks here so if anyone is interested in joining me, I made a Discord (message me for the link!). 

Basically, the idea is to visit at least one food place (coffee shop, bar, or restaurant) and non-food place (park, museum, landmark, library, etc) for each neighborhood. SF officially recognizes 36 neighborhoods, but so many of those neighborhoods recognized overlap or share a general area so I figure I can knock out 2-3 of these neighborhoods a month and have a new spot to visit all 12 months of the year.

12/29/25:/12/30/25
first dream i fell asleep anywhere from 7-9 pm and woke up around 1 am; my dream was in my apt(my actually home) and it had somebody who looked like or it was ari fletcher there was some type of white powder substance on the coffee table we fought because she was complaining about me being messy because the trash wasn't taken or or something similar (what's crazy is i need to take my trash out right now) and in my dream everybody was shocked because she was like the NTTV ivori (strong and unbeatable) neither of us won but it was a good fight 
12/30/25:
(deeply disturbing dream)
fell back asleep anytime around 2:30-3:30 AM woke up a few mins before 5 AM
i was in my apt it was dark.. really dark... my dream seemed demonic i was sexually aroused the whole dream apt was messy (took place in my actual apt AGAIN) i believe i was being picked up and thrown around hard but not too hard seemed like the demons or invisible people were fucking me, in the shower and on the rug on the floor... (insane i know but this is what happened) i went to go thru some things and ended up finding many sex toys of different sizes was playing with myself a white and black cat ran past me i think i was already done idk (at this point i knew i was dreaming but it continued) i tried to catch the cat as i was laying on the floor it tried to jump out my window but it was closed and when i picked the cat up it was black not white anymore it wasn't fully grown either but it wasn't a baby.... and then i woke up, when i woke up i had a feeling i will never be able to describe..(keep in mind i probably dream AT MOST 3-4 times a year & this happened twice within a couple hours of each other. i feel odd. 
12/30/25 woke up around 9-9:30 am 
(another deeply disturbing dream) 
i don't recognize this place I'm there with a man and a woman. The vibes were weird. i don't remember how it happened but i ended up shot they thought i was dead i guess they were trying to cut off my skin and transfer it to somebody else they already had somebody else's cut skin laying out it was like half of a body blood everywhere i tried to get up and escape i made it out the front door there were two bolt locks i had to open i was weak from the blood i lost for some reason this place was literally a few feet from a bart (train) station i got on the bart falling over yet still standing up i was screaming for somebody to help me yet everybody was just staring at me the woman came inside pulled a small glock from her breast area and shot me in the head and then i woke up... sweaty....

> “He's got some philosophical things that are probably a little on the edge of most people,"" MacLellan said. ""He's a little quirky.""

> Given his history at both positions, did Chychrun ever think about going the Brent Burns route and playing forward and defense as a pro? ""Yeah, that's a good question. Not really. But if there's ever a moment where a coach feels like I need to be used up front, I mean, I would absolutely love it. I think it'd be a blast,"" he said with a laugh.

> There's more than a little Brent Burns in Jakob Chychrun, and not just because they generate so much offense from the back end. Chychrun said he's had many conversations with the Colorado Avalanche defenseman about a mutual affinity for hunting and about visiting Burns' compound in Texas. According to the Capitals, he also shares some of Burns' idiosyncrasies. ""When he goes on a tangent, it's like, 'Wait, you're actually Brent Burns,'"" Carbery joked.

> Like Burns, Chychrun likes his own stuff. While he doesn't lug around a giant backpack like Burns -- one that contains everything from essential oils to a coffee maker -- Chychrun has been known to bring his own food on the road as part of his well-curated diet.

> ""I always overhear [the players] giving him a hard time about all the unique practices that Chicky has. He's always got his own personal stuff he's bringing on the bus,"" Carbery said. ""And I'm like, 'Man, that guy is dedicated to his body and his craft and is not going to leave any stone unturned.'""

> Chychrun has been fascinated with diet and nutrition since his early teens. His father's trainer was a family friend and set Chychrun up with a dietary plan to gain size as an athlete. ""At the time, I was so young to be doing that, but I loved it,"" he said. ""I was packing my own school lunches. I think all my buddies thought I was nuts back then. So, not much has changed.""

> ""His physique is not like too many guys that I played with before in the NHL. He takes very, very good care of his body and is very detailed with what he puts into it,"" Strome said. ""He's always checking the labels and the ingredients on things and then making sure that it's good for him.""

1pztghg,https://i.redd.it/czi5glstmeag1.jpeg,Nic Cage Says “Don’t Buy Starbucks”,"Hey folks. You might have noticed while admiring our truly beautiful Nic Cage mural, that the Starbucks next door has been closed since November.

The baristas at the 29th & Willamette Starbucks are ON STRIKE alongside stores across the country, as the company has stalled on negotiations for a fair contract. It has been nearly a year since Starbucks has offered a single proposal to finish their first contract with the 600+ union stores nationwide.

The union is asking customers to NOT buy Starbucks at any location - union or non-union - until the company provides its baristas a fair contract! 

The company knows where we stand: we need fair wages, better scheduling, and an end to union busting. Instead, Starbucks has chosen to line the pockets of their CEO Brian Niccol, who got a $90 million signing bonus and commutes from his California home to the Seattle company headquarters in his private jet.

Please support local coffee spots nearby:
- Barry’s Espresso Bakery and Deli on 28th and Oak
- Quick Fix Coffee Co. on 25th and Willamette
- The Crown Cafe, Great Harvest, Metropol Bakery, and plenty more great spots just down the street!",118,1767128006.0,Eugene,9,0.9,False

Which is the best time to get in 😉

But I know Downtown Jebel Ali will be kicking off big time in 2026 - and the fact that several big name developers have launched projects there already further backs my statement! Most of those are sold out now and haven’t even broken ground yet!

Location is great, right next to the metro, situated in downtown jebel Ali, a stones throw away from Palm jebel Ali, 10 mins from Al Furjan, and also near to Dubai South (again, that’s why this whole area is popping off, due to the infrastructure being put in place in Furjan, Jebel Ali, Dubai South as the city extends itself)

Anyway, enough blabbering on..

I’ve spent a lot of time around downtown jebel Ali and I came across a new project that is launching NEXT WEEK!

By a trusted developer who has luxury developments under their belt, completed already

Handover Q4 2027
50/50 payment plan
Prices starting at around 550,000 AED 

I would absolutely love to grab a coffee with some of you and go over this project in more detail -

Also if anyone wants the full deets as it’s not even launched yet, let me know below. . I’m more excited about this than the developer themselves 🤣

Pero months before that, may nangyari na sobrang thankful ako ngayon kasi dun talaga yung clarity ko.

Nagkita kami sa SM, as usual. That time, pareho pa kaming nakatira sa parents namin. Ako may stable corporate job, maayos ang income, walang issue sa cash flow. Siya VA for two clients lang, tig-1–2 hours each. Yung isa pa dun, galing sa akin nung VA pa ako dati.

Naglalakad lang kami sa mall and I suggested mag-coffee. Alam kong gipit siya, so I offered to pay. Ayaw niya initially, pero gusto ko talaga magkape so I ordered for both of us. Okay lang, no issue.

While waiting for the coffee, sabi ko baka pwede kami mag-brownie. Meaning, siya naman magbabayad this time. Biglang sabi niya coffee lang daw siya, and clearly, wala rin siyang pake na gusto ko ng brownie. I even said, “Sige na, isa lang, ₱60 lang naman.” Wag na kasi may kape naman daw.

Dumating yung kape. Tahimik lang ako. Tapos bigla niyang sinabi na balak daw niya sa weekend tumingin ng Switch game sa SM. Alam ko mas mahal pa sa 60 pesos yun HAHAHA

At that point, may boses sa utak ko na nagsabing: sabihin mo na, para matauhan. So sinabi ko: “Yung cookie nga di mo mabili, yan pa kaya?”

Obviously, napahiya siya. Out of guilt, bumili siya ng isang cookie and inabot sa akin sabay sabi: “Eto, para sa kasiyahan mo at para sa peace of mind ko.”

AY WOW THANK YOU. 

Fast forward 2–3 months later. Nasa business trip ako, naka-video call kami, casual lang. I asked him straight: ano ba timeline mo mag-settle down, and ano ba plano mo sa amin? Me asking for the millionth time haha

Legit sagot niya:
“Either 1 year, or 3 years, or 5 years di ko pa sure”

HAHAHAHA. Sa isip ko: Baka puti na bulb*l ko, wala ka pa ring plano. 

That was it for me. Natagalan kasi natakot mag isa. I realized mas okay mag isa na may Plano sa buhay kesa sa matali sa taong di pa rin sure after 9yrs (at di pa rin afford ang 60php na brownie). 🫡

1pztdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1pztdlg/linea_mini_r_2025_troubleshooting/,Linea Mini R (2025) Troubleshooting,"Hi all,

Purchased a new Linea Mini R from Chris' Coffee early 2025. Was very satisfied with retailer and the initial user experience. Unfortunately, after around 4 months, the steam wand and hot water stopped working. 

I emailed Chris' Coffee and they were extremely responsive but ultimately had to get referred to La Marzocco USA Home Warranty and a local tech team came to my home to repair/replace the heating element. Overall it was a smooth experience, despite the inconvenience and frustration of not being able to use a new machine. 

Then, last week (approximately 9 months after purchase), the machine started emanating a horrible burning plastic smell that took over the entire house. Suffocating, actually so we started another warranty ticket that will be repaired tomorrow. I took some panels off but didn't notice any melted connectors. 

Does anyone else have experience with any of this? Is anyone else's machine acting crazy? 

I don't believe I'm doing anything wrong but for reference the machine schedule is:

Machine turns on around 6AM and turns off around 4PM each day. Around 3-6 double shots pulled each day with occasional days with 10-15 double shots maybe once a week. Water quality has been checked and the reservoir is kept full most days but maybe once every 2-3 weeks the tank is empty and we have to remember to refill.

For the record: Chris' Coffee, La Marzocco Warranty, and Pit Crew Coffee Service have ALL been great with their service and communication. I'm just annoyed this machine is acting up as much as it does. 

Thanks in advance for any feedback. ",2,1767127805.0,LaMarzocco,3,1.0,False

I'd like a single dose grinder - I've looked at the Lagos and the Opus. These look like what is like to have. While I can tell a good coffee, I don't really know much about the different kinds of grinder or if it really matters.

So keep in mind I was in a relationship with someone for about 11 months (dec 2024 to nov 2025) but things didn’t work out

I met this friend around March 2025 but didn’t really start talking to her until May 2025. A lot of our initial friendship was working together for this volunteer political organization were in together. We did a lot of work together, planning events and helping each other with our respective goals. It was great and we would meet a lot for coffee and on zoom to discuss stuff. But obviously once business was done, we did get to know each other a bit more but nothing out of the ordinary. She even hung out with myself and my ex sometimes. When with my ex, I did gain some feelings for my friend as she had things that I thought weren’t important (that I later realized I was compromising on) that my ex didn’t. But I thought that might have just been me feeling like I was missing out on dating others and settling.

Come end of November, I break up with my ex because I think we just wouldn’t have worked out long term. My friend and I were supposed to go to a political rally that day but I told we I just wanted to hang since I wasn’t really in the mindset to do work. She agreed and she even helped me move the last of my stuff out of my old apartment to my new one. We went out to eat and just hung out for a lot of the night till I had to go elsewhere. She even said something about watching a movie together at our organizations office that night but I declined since I had made plans with my cousin for later.

About a few days later, she texted saying if I needed anything to help with the breakup before she left to her week vacation and I said I’d be down to hang out and we hung out that weekend and spent all day doing everything she had recommended. During this hang out I had mentioned that I wished she could come to this party I was going to the following week that she was gonna be out of town for. (I’d say that for anyone) and she, looking out for my best interest, said I should keep finding more friends 

Come a week later and I’m on a panel and she texts me saying she can now make this event we had planned with a union since she was coming back early from her vacation. I asked her how it was and she said it was good. She asked me how my party was and I said idk cuz I hadn’t gone yet. She then asked if I still wanted company and I said yeah. So we hung out for that whole night and had tons of fun at the party where she even offered to sew a hole in a sweater I was wearing that night. 

That Monday we did the event with the union and I asked her if she was hungry for dinner and she said yes (which weve done before). After dinner she had mentioned how she felt trapped in her thoughts sometimes when alone so I invited her over. She wasn’t feeling well and went home early. She texted me about something personal after getting home and that was the last time I saw her before going on Christmas break.

Now I’m back and I wanna hang with her. However, I’m a bit anxious. i don’t want to over do it.  I do like her but I’m really not sure how she feels back. I also want to wait a bit obviously since I’m still fresh out of a relationship. I really feel great when I’m around her but idk I just don’t wanna mess things up on accident and misinterpret friendship for romantic interest. She started hanging out with me more 1 on 1 after the break up and started telling more personal stuff but idk if that’s a natural evolution of our friendship or something else. I have a small gift for her as well (as well as other friends) that I’m excited to give. 

Idk chat what do?

TLDR: I have feelings for a close friend but the timing is a bit off and I want to wait before I decide to make a move. But also I’m not even sure if I should make a move at all ",1,1767127610.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

2. I’m planning on buying a bunch of different varieties of snacks/sweets (in addition to the main food he’s planning) - I’m sure this is very dependent on the person, but do you have any recommendations of things you would have wanted?

3. Ways to support him? I’m sure mostly I will just be checking in with him about what he would want for the next break and have it prepared for him, but is there anything I could offer or bring as a surprise that might be encouraging? (I’m planning on making him a sign)

My budget is not much, but I'm not materialistic either and I do sports, for example to eat I only have 1 meal a day and there are days that I stay 1 day and a half or 2 without eating anything, only coffee and water and I feel very good, because I'm used to it. So I would like you to help me figure out where I can start? I'm Portuguese but Europe honestly doesn't tell me anything. I have Angolan descent, and I have a lot in mind Africa or Asia, but I don't want to arrive and be surprised for not having gone with enough.

FLX… lean more into the success of this dupt brand. I think of this as Kohl’s skims… Honestly, maybe either get rid of Tek Gear, or other athletic wear… I’m thinking keep Nike and Under Armor only with FLX and maybe tek gear… 

Get rid of simply Vera neon color clothes. It ALL goes to clearance… LC and Nine West are strong enough. I would also keep Sonoma and Croft but make Sonoma more of the basics… 

There’s no real chain toy store for kids anymore. I would put a lot of effort and focus into this. I would also step into the electronics game of game consoles… legos is a staple, Melissa and Doug, etc. 

Home will only survive if they follow the trends. Why do we sell wallpaper and beer pictures… the product boost from France and Germany, Italy, etc never stuck. 

In the end, I think kohls needs to simplify… there brands like Sonoma should be staples instead of fashion. 

Last thing of money wasn’t a problem, I would partner with either 7brew to put coffee shops in the store or in front and or come up with the kohls Kafe… this is another thing that would have to follow trends to stay afloat like Dubai chocolate, trendy snacks, etc!!

So, I know this has got to be one of the most asked/annoying to some question you guys get in here, but I have a caveat to throw in. I currently have an Encore 485, and recently the tabs on my ring burr broke, currently waiting to hear back from Baratza to see if it's still under warranty, I doubt it, got it back in 2023, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Anyway, I'm still pretty new with coffee (2023, to be exact), and can make a pretty decent cup. I do exclusively pour over (v60) and French Press, only because I can't figure out how to use my Mokka pot, and the wife is happy with whatever caffeine I give her.

But back to my question, while waiting to hear back about my ring burr, I was thinking of using it as an excuse to upgrade to an ESP/ESP Pro, I HAVE looked at the Eureka Mignon, but I like Baratza's CS. I currently don't make espresso, don't have a machine,  but would like the option if I decide to buy one. Would I notice much or any difference with the ESP/Pro for v60/French press, is it a waste of $ to make such a small leap, the ESP DOES look like it is easier to upgrade/repair than the older encore so there is that, too.",1,1767127075.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False
1pzt2ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1pzt2ng/dream_interpretation_for_3_separate_dreams_2/,Dream interpretation for 3 separate dreams (2 dreams are reoccurring and 1 I had last night).,"Dream 1 (reoccurring) 

Backstory: I met one of the best people in my life in college - Adam. We tried dating, but it never worked out for various reasons. However, we still remained very close friends and spent almost every day together. About a year later, (due to personal issues) he moved across the state very suddenly and we lost touch for several months. We reconnected, but did not see each other as often and communication dwindled. He was in the process of moving back to the area I was in, but Covid derailed those plans and our communication become more and more sporadic. Life continued to move forward, he got engaged and I did as well, then I moved several states away. We were then only talking every 4-6 months to catch up with each other. This is where the dreams come into play. 

Dream: After our communication dwindled so much, I began having dreams with Adam. Nothing would stand out in particular, except the rooms we were in did not look familiar. We would be sitting on a cozy couch together, talking and drinking coffee, listening to music or occasionally having conversations at this nice brown table in a green dining room with warm lighting. Conversation constantly flowed and we laughed a ton. We would talk about our days and just relax. Some dreams, Adam would end the dream by saying “talk to you soon” and then I’d wake up. If he said that in a dream, I’d get a text within 24 hours from Adam and we would talk over the phone and catch up in real life. Communication was still sporadic, but we spoke in dreams often. I felt like I’d sound insane even bringing the dreams up to Adam, but to my surprise, he brought it up first because he had been having THE SAME ONES. 
We’ve since lost touch entirely (nothing nefarious, just life) and I can no longer get his attention in dreams. 

Questions: How was communication via dreams even possible? Why can’t I reach him now? 


Dream 2 (reoccurring) 

Backstory: I went to elementary school with a kid named John. We were very close in elementary school, he moved for middle school, then came back to the same high school I attended. Due to him moving in middle school, we weren’t close in high school but remained friendly and ran in similar social circles. Unfortunately, he passed away before our high school graduation due to a car accident. 

Dream: John brings me flowers any time he’s in my dreams. We won a contest together in elementary school, and he picked me flowers from the sidelines after it was announced we won. Every dream I have of him, he smiles, hands over the flowers, gives a little nod and wave, and leaves. No words are ever exchanged, there’s never a rhyme or reason why he appears. He’s just there, hands over flowers, then he’s gone. 

Question: What does this dream mean? We weren’t close when he passed, but this is a dream I have often. 


Dream 3 (new dream)
This dream is one of the more bizarre ones I’ve had. 

In the dream, my husband and I went back to my hometown to celebrate Christmas. We started by going to see my dad’s side of the family. I greeted everyone and they told me I could go see my grandad, as he was asleep in the bedroom. I walked to the bedroom, and found him lying there, rail thin, and he greeted me by name and gave me a hug. Not too weird - except he passed from cancer 6 years before I was born. I said my goodbyes to him and then met up with some high school friends. They said our school was hosting a Christmas party/class reunion and would love if I came with them. So I agreed. My friends and I get to the school and are immediately met with familiar faces. I see my friends talking to several people I haven’t seen in years. I slowly realize that one of the girls isn’t responding to any of my friend’s questions. I approach her and start speaking to her. She looks at me but says nothing. I asked my friend if she knew why the girl wasn’t responding, but my friend wouldn’t answer the question and kept ignoring me. I went to another friend, asked the same question, and got the same response - completely ignored. I then start becoming VERY aware of real life while in my dream state. The girl can’t talk - she passed from a traumatic brain injury a few years ago. She’s not there. I then look at the next person - another classmate that passed. I looked at the next person, and it’s John. He hands me the flowers, gives me the same smirk, and walks away. That’s when I wake up. 

Question: I’ll take any interpretation of this dream. I don’t even know where to begin with it. 

TLDR: In dream 1, I was able to communicate with someone via dreams before hearing from them in real life. In dream 2 and dream 3, people who have passed on keep popping up (including my grandad who passed before I was born and classmates I hadn’t seen in years). ",1,1767127068.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

1pzt1ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1pzt1ny/how_much_of_our_behavior_is_truly_conscious_the/,How Much of Our Behavior is Truly Conscious? The Science of the Unconscious Mind,"​We often like to believe we are the captains of our own ships, making deliberate choices about everything from the coffee we buy to the career paths we pursue. However, modern neuroscience and psychology suggest a more humbling reality.
​So, how much of our behavior is truly conscious? While it is difficult to pin down an exact percentage, many experts estimate that as much as 95% of our brain activity occurs beyond our conscious awareness.

​The Illusion of Conscious Control
​For decades, researchers have explored the ""gap"" between our brain's activity and our conscious realization of a decision. We often feel we are deciding in the moment, but our biology has usually already started the process.

​The ""Ready"" Brain: Research shows the brain prepares for action before we ""decide"" to move.
​Efficiency: If we had to consciously process every heartbeat or step, our ""mental RAM"" would crash instantly.

​System 1 vs. System 2: Our minds use a fast, intuitive system for most tasks and a slow, logical system for complex ones.

​Key Studies on Consciousness and Behavior
​To understand the depth of the unconscious mind, we must look at the landmark studies that shaped this field.

​1. The Libet Experiment (1983)
​Author: Benjamin Libet et al.
Study: Time of Conscious Intention to Act in Relation to Onset of Cerebral Activity (Readiness-Potential) Published in: Brain
​In this seminal study, Libet found that a ""readiness potential"" (a surge in brain activity) occurred roughly 350 to 500 milliseconds before a participant reported the conscious ""urge"" to move their finger. This suggests that the brain initiates voluntary movements before the person is even aware of their intention.

​2. Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011)
​Author: Daniel Kahneman
Study/Work: Thinking, Fast and Slow Published by: Farrar, Straus and Giroux
​Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman popularized the ""Dual Process Theory."" He categorized brain function into two systems:
​System 1 (Unconscious): Fast, instinctive, and emotional. It handles 90–95% of daily tasks like driving a familiar route or reading facial expressions.

​System 2 (Conscious): Slower, more deliberative, and logical. It is used for complex math or learning a new language.

​3. The Power of Priming (1996)
​Author: John Bargh et al.
Study: Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action Published in: Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
​Yale professor John Bargh demonstrated how subtle environmental cues—""priming""—influence behavior without our knowledge. In one famous (though debated) trial, participants primed with words related to the elderly walked more slowly down a hallway than the control group, entirely unaware that the words had affected their physical speed.

​Why Is Most Behavior Unconscious?
​The reason we operate on ""autopilot"" is biological economy. The brain represents about 2% of our body weight but consumes 20% of its energy.
​Pattern Recognition: The unconscious mind is a master of patterns. It recognizes a ""friend"" or a ""threat"" in milliseconds.

​Skill Acquisition: Once you learn to ride a bike, the ""how-to"" is moved to the subconscious to free up conscious space.

​Survival: Reflexes, such as pulling your hand away from a hot stove, must bypass conscious thought to prevent injury.

​Can We Reclaim Control?
​While the unconscious mind runs the show, we aren't completely helpless. Science suggests that while we might not ""start"" every impulse, we have the power of ""free won't""—the ability to consciously veto an unconscious urge before it becomes an action.

​By practicing mindfulness and becoming aware of our triggers, we can move more of our behavior from the shadows of the unconscious into the light of deliberate choice.",1,1767127001.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

They help me so much, particularly with emotional regulation and staying “unstuck” that I have recently decided to start taking them daily, whereas up until this point I have taken them only on workdays. 

My only complaint/side effect is that I do have some sleep issues, which have gotten better with time but still exist. I have found on workdays, when I have to be up earlier anyway, it works pretty well for me to take my first one early enough that I can take my second one around noon, and this generally allows me to fall asleep more or less on time. However, I don’t sleep as deeply and sometimes have more difficulty than normal relaxing both my body and my mind. 

It was nice to have the med breaks on the weekends because I slept better, and I also let myself have as much coffee as I wanted on the weekends too 🙂. Now that I want to take my meds daily, I won’t get that improved sleep break, and I also am struggling with scheduling my doses because I tend to wake up/get up very late on the weekends, meaning if I took both of my doses I’d end up taking the second one at a time more likely to interrupt my sleep later (I already know 2pm is my absolute drop-dead time for a second dose if I want to get decent sleep). 

Any advice on how to improve sleep with daily Adderall use? My brain has always been fried at night my whole life, so rigid or complex nighttime/sleep routines have never really worked for me, but if there are simple things I can try to make habitual like supplements (I’ve heard magnesium is good and I’m trying to make it a bedtime habit), herbal tea, etc. I’m very down for it. Melatonin does help me but I try to avoid using it every night so I don’t become dependent on it to sleep.

I am also open to trying other meds but as I said, other than a little trouble with sleep quality (not even really quantity) I am super happy with how my Adderall IR works for me.",2,1767126908.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

I’m really struggling with my ENTP’s “need” for socializing that seems excessive to me. The four Christmas and Birthdays we’ve been together he refuses to acknowledge my birthday. No “happy birthday”, no cards, gifts or cup of coffee. Nothing. He also refuses to have a Christmas/holiday thing with me where it’s just the two of us. I’ve calmly explained why this is extremely hurtful. He doesn’t respond. To add to the insult it’s not uncommon for us to spend 12+ hours at his family’s house on Christmas Eve. The remaining days between Christmas and new years he’s partying with his friends or at his parents house. I know he’s capable because he plans ahead for his parents birthdays and buys them extravagant gifts. He also celebrates his friends birthdays. He is well off so it’s not a financial thing (and I’m not materialistic, I just want acknowledgement). 

I feel completely alone. It especially sucks because my birthday is Jan. 1st and he’s too busy “taking care of his own social needs” to acknowledge my birthday.

I’ll be very honest- I’m thinking of taking my family on an NCL as it is much cheaper for my family of 5 than Princess, which would be our alternative option.

However, I’ve heard the upcharges on NCL are crazy. I’m having a hard time grasping if that is normal across cruise lines or unique to NCL. For example, I read that even with a drink package you get taxed and need to add gratuity? Is that accurate and is that normal across cruises? On our last Princess I don’t recall that being the case but I might not have paid close attention. Is specialty coffee available with the drink package? (I’d like a latte in the morning).

Any other things you can think of that would be unexpected charges? We just want a simple vacation where the kids can swim and we can have nice weather. Incredible food isn’t important to us on this trip so we won’t be doing specialty dining. Our standards aren’t that high tbh and we don’t typically find much to complain about even when things don’t go perfectly.

I. K. Dubinkin was a police major.

One morning, after waking up, he sat down for breakfast. Pasta with a cutlet and a double coffee — his wife had served it.

""Can you imagine? Lyudka from the neighboring building got arrested!""

Dubinkin grunted approvingly. They were working according to plan. Good job.

He finished his main course, walked over to the window, and took a cigarette from the pack on top of the refrigerator.

Overnight, the courtyard had been buried in snow. The first footprints belonged to the major's colleagues, escorting a young man in a light-colored leather jacket.

Major Dubinkin cracked the window open and smoked with satisfaction.

The front door slammed — the major's son had left for school.

""I want to fry some chicken today,"" his wife announced.

The major nodded.

After finishing his cigarette, he yawned loudly, scratched his belly beneath his white undershirt, and shuffled off to get dressed.



An old tram swallowed the next wave of the morning crowd and creaked into motion.

Major I. K. Dubinkin stood inside, gripping the cold handrail with his elbow.

The tram swayed over bumps and turns.

Clack-clack, clack-clack

Dubinkin carried a briefcase full of documents and an opaque bag with his lunch container. On his feet were polished boots. Everything as it should be.

The tram stopped abruptly. Major Dubinkin was jolted hard, and someone stepped on his foot.

""Outrageous!"" a woman nearby barked.

A low grumble spread through the car.

The central door rattled and clanged open. Two officers in epaulettes stood outside.

One remained on guard, while the other squeezed inside. He made his way to a plump elderly woman in a coat and green beret, seated near the front of the tram.

""Well, there you are, my dear!""

The old woman flinched and stared at the policeman in confusion.

""What's going on, sonny?""

""Come along, granny.""

He seized her firmly and dragged her toward the door. The old woman dropped her handbag; a can of peas rolled out.

""What are you doing, you brute?!"" She struggled futilely, even hopping once in resistance.

Having delivered the old woman to his partner, they deftly twisted her arms, snapped handcuffs on, and led her away.

I. K. Dubinkin twitched his nose with pleasure. They really know how to cheer a man up, the imps.



The Sixth Police Precinct was a pale blue building, four stories high.

After shaking hands with all the important people, major I. K. Dubinkin made his way to his office and flicked the light switch. The lamps blinked, hummed, and finally came on.

On the large mahogany conference table lay stacks of papers: reports, complaints, petitions, and more, more, more... On the smaller desk — whatever had been left over from the previous day. Half-asleep, the major glanced at the piles and sighed thoughtfully. Then he went to the lunch corner and bent down to stash his lunch container in the small refrigerator under the cupboard. When he straightened up, his damned back ached. He stretched, worked himself loose a little. From the cupboard, major Dubinkin took out a gift bottle of cognac and a shot glass with the Ministry of Internal Affairs emblem. He knocked back a small one, smoothed his graying hair, slapped his cheeks. The morning heaviness finally receded. Time to get to work.

He settled into his leather chair, took his glasses out of their case, and pulled the nearest stack toward him.

Everything began the same way: ""To the Head of Police Precinct No. 6 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, City of T, Police major I. K. Dubinkin.""

And then: ""I hereby report that on such-and-such a date, at approximately such-and-such a time, at the address: City of T, Suspicious Lane, building 4, I observed citizen Ivan Ivanovich Maslyonkin, who was standing... Based on the above and in accordance with Regulation XYZ of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, City of T, citizen Maslyonkin was transferred to patrol unit 2517 for delivery to Police Precinct No. 6 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, City of T, for further proceedings.""

The major signed his name and slammed the stamp down.

A petition from citizen Romashkina: ""I ask you to clarify the fate of my husband, Ivan Gennadyevich Romashkin, who was detained while walking home from the store carrying a net bag of potatoes. At least return the potatoes.""

Dubinkin snorted, set the document aside, and cracked his neck.

The next message was brief: ""Give me back my son, you bastard!""

Major Dubinkin guffawed, crumpled the sheet, and tossed it into the trash.

A report from W. O. Taburetka: ""I request fourteen calendar days of unpaid leave due to excessive overtime.""

""Request denied,"" Dubinkin scribbled.

After sending the paper to the completed pile, the major removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.

Outside the window someone shouted, ""Stop or I'll shoot!"" A gunshot followed.

Major Dubinkin leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling for a moment. He remembered that they were out of bread at home — he'd need to stop by Natasha's after work.

After gazing at the lamps and blinking a few times, the major sat up properly and picked up his pen again.

The work went even easier after that: major I. K. Dubinkin read diagonally, sometimes even in a zigzag. He signed and stamped, signed and stamped. Paper, pen, stamp. Paper, pen, stamp.

The major was productive and processed four hundred and ninety-two documents that day.



I. K. Dubinkin entered Natasha's and was about to ask the cashier for bread when a woman in a white coat suddenly rushed up.

""Some lard, please.""

The cashier obediently cut a piece, brought it over, and weighed it.

""Two hundred exactly.""

The woman pulled a handful of coins from her pocket and poured them into the little dish by the register.

""That should be enough.""

""We'll see.""

The cashier counted tens and five-ruble coins. Major Dubinkin set his net bag of potatoes on the floor and, with nothing better to do, began to examine the shelves. He glanced at the refrigerator with drinks: Gorin beer — nasty stuff. In a corner he spotted a small television showing the news, the sound turned almost all the way down so not a word could be made out; nearby stood shelves of expensive alcohol. Five-year-old FIGLAR cognac. Now that was something.

The cashier moved on to the smaller coins. Major Dubinkin began tapping his foot.

Outside the shop window, a flock of pigeons surrounded a sparrow. One after another they hopped onto it, pecking. The sparrow couldn't take off.

""You're twenty rubles short.""

The customer patted her pockets — nothing. She took off her backpack and rummaged through a side pouch.

""Here, take this."" She laid out four more five-ruble coins.

The cashier gathered them up.

""Thank you for your purchase.""

""Thank you.""

The woman left. Major Dubinkin stepped up to the register.

""A loaf of white, major?"" The major was a regular bread customer, so the cashier already knew all his habits.

The major nodded.

The cashier went to the bread racks and picked out the freshest, softest loaf for him. She packed it in a bag and returned, placing it by the register.

""Major, hey, major! Things are hectic — arrests everywhere. You must be in the know, major... whisper it in my ear!""

Major Dubinkin grinned in response but didn't betray any official secrets. Instead, he took out a hundred-ruble bill, waited for his change, gave a salute, turned around, and left.



The stairwell already smelled of fried chicken.

Major Dubinkin handed his wife the bread and the net bag of potatoes.

""If you wait a bit, I'll make mashed potatoes,"" she said.

The major undressed, washed up, checked on his son. The two of them sat in the kitchen, watching television, waiting for the mash. Then the family sat down to dinner.

""Good chicken, juicy,"" the son said.

The major grunted in agreement.

The front door slammed, then the kitchen door swung open. A squad entered.

""Nikolai Dubinkin?"" The tallest of them addressed the son. He pulled a bundle from his bag, unwrapped it, and displayed it to everyone present, holding it carefully by both edges like an ancient scroll. ""An arrest warrant.""

Sitting with his back to the door, the son looked from his father to the tall officer. Then back to his father. Then again to the tall officer. He kept turning back and forth until major Dubinkin flicked his fork — meaning, take him.

The boy was bent face-down onto the table, handcuffed, and led out of the apartment. The door slammed shut.

The major's wife burst into tears. The major kept chewing his chicken. Warrants aren't written for nothing — that meant there was a reason. That meant they had nourished a viper in the bosom

I. K. Dubinkin finished his meal, stacked his plate in the sink, washed up, lightly trimmed his mustache with scissors, lay down in bed, and at last, feeling the fatigue of a long day, began to snore.



DAY TWO

Despite a restless night, major Dubinkin woke up feeling refreshed.

Overnight, his wife had gone through all the tissues and was still sleeping it off in the living room.

The major reheated yesterday's chicken and mashed potatoes himself. Made some coffee.

The weather forecast was on TV. The morning would be sunny, but by evening clouds would roll in, and by tomorrow frost would hit the city of T — so promised the host, an elderly man in a knitted vest. While describing the coming day, he faltered mid-sentence, hid his hands behind his head, and awkwardly dropped to his knees. The broadcast cut off as a service weapon appeared in the frame.

The major switched away from that circus and landed on an old war movie. Finished eating, cracked the window open, lit a cigarette.

His wife came into the kitchen, wrapped in a shawl, trying to keep warm.

""Please, s-stop by for eggs after your shift,"" she said, placing a hand on his shoulder.

The major couldn't tear his eyes away from the screen and merely nodded.



Major Dubinkin got off the tram a couple of stops early — he didn't want to miss the good weather.

The rising sun lit up the cobblestoned square. The major turned his aging mustache into the gentle breeze and walked on, breathing deeply.

He spotted a woman in a lavender jacket and fashionable glasses — standing at the crosswalk, rummaging through her bag. Hands appeared from behind, gently covered her mouth. The woman was dragged around the corner; her bag remained on the asphalt.

He glanced at a street cleaner with a black sack — he was dragged away as well.

The major hummed a tune from his youth under his breath.

A minibus with flashing lights cut across the road. People began to be loaded inside. Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven...

Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap

Major Dubinkin watched the performance, saluted with a smile, and was about to move on when someone coughed in the bushes. Dubinkin whistled and pointed. Twenty-eight.

The major turned into an alley, where two officers were wrestling a dog to the ground. (Handcuff model ""Bark-9,"" specially designed for large breeds.) He saluted them as well and continued on his way.



That was how he reached his home precinct. Inside — chaos.

Bochkaryov was packing up Zelyonkin. Suslov and Spitsyn stood facing the wall — they were being searched by Shkafchenko and Zhelezny. The insolent warrant officer Taburetka lay face-down on the floor.

Everyone was running around, shouting at one another, papers flying — not a minute of peace.

""Come with me.""

""No, you come with me.""

The major hid in his office and quietly shut the door.

Looking through paperwork seemed far too simple a task for such a clear day.

He wasn't afraid of difficulties, so he uncorked another bottle of Armenian cognac from his desk. He inhaled the wonderful aroma of linden, honey, and chocolate. He drank a shot for every detention report — and quickly grew cross-eyed.

From all that productive labor, drowsiness crept over major Dubinkin. He closed his eyes and signed in the wrong box. Well — so be it.

Having finished the stack, I. K. Dubinkin was about to sit down to lunch when the secretary, E. L. Tatarov, burst into the office.

""Comrade major, at least you tell them!"" Tatarov pleaded.

Dubinkin looked at him, frowned, and slammed his hand on the desk.

""There you are!"" Two more burst into the office, struck Tatarov under the knee — as a precaution — and hauled him away.

Major Dubinkin exhaled with satisfaction and finally took out his food container. He put it in the microwave.

After lunch, the major firmly decided to take a nap in the lunch corner. And sweet was his sleep — right up until the end of the shift.



Standing in the tram was difficult — the major felt he might fall at every bump. So, he sat down in the nearest empty seat. Perhaps someone had given it up for him. He wasn't sure.

Soon the movement stopped. Dubinkin rested his head against the seat in front of him and studied the floor. There was some muttering, some swearing, some thudding sounds in the car. The major jolted when he heard his own snoring.

He was fed up with everything. He looked ahead — no traffic light, no jam, no accident. And there was no one else in the car. So why were they standing? He shuffled to the driver's cabin. Empty. The major climbed out through the open door.

Nothing remained of the morning's grace. Real clouds drifted across the sky. Howling winds hurried the major along.

Well... good things don't last.

The evening frost invigorated him, and the major walked more confidently.



At Natasha's, an old woman greeted him.

""No point going in there, sonny.""

The major didn't quite understand and went in anyway.

No one — only the television squealing on an empty channel.

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

The major had had enough — he'd already spent the whole evening on the road. Dubinkin pushed aside the counter, took a box of eggs.

A sense of justice stirred in the major's soul, so he placed the exact payment into the coin tray.

He put the counter back and flipped the sign on the door to ""Closed.""



His wife met him at home, once again in tears.

""Galya, my Galya!"" she wailed. ""They arrested them... the whole family... even took the children!""

She clutched Dubinkin's arm, soaking the expensive fabric with her snot.

The major pushed her aside so he could undress calmly. His wife shuffled into the living room, wiping her face, and curled up on the couch.

The kitchen table was bare. The major would cook dinner himself, then. He'd take two eggs, put them in a pot, and boil them. All the household burdens were on him... a freeloader... disgraceful...

She puffed around all day, and he — he did the work.

The eggs turned out somewhat poached. That was exactly how Dubinkin had intended it.

In the fridge he found sausages. Old, shriveled — but there was no choice.

It was a filling meal. Major Dubinkin let out a hearty belch. Then — naturally — lit a cigarette.

The evening had completely infuriated him. But the major was good-natured, so he limited himself to yelling at the top of his lungs, just as long ago — just as kindly — his father had yelled at him, belt in hand. Or teachers at school when he misbehaved. Or a sergeant in the army — for sleeping on guard duty. While the strong shout, the weak are tempered. That is upbringing. If the weak can't take it — we don't need them.

AAARGH, DAMN IT ALL TO HELL.

The major calmed down. He stubbed out his cigarette and shoved the damned eggs back into the refrigerator.



DAY THREE

The major woke up with a pounding headache. He found his wife in the same place as before — on the living room couch — and once again she had not pleased him with breakfast. Even when he shook her by the shoulder, she merely waved him off and burrowed into the pillow.

In the refrigerator he found the remains of mashed potatoes and a pitiful chicken leg — dried up and dead, meaning very thin indeed. The major reheated it all in the microwave.

Nothing was on television. More than fifty channels — emptiness everywhere. That morning, major Dubinkin ate in silence.

He was even out of cigarettes, so the major left the apartment a bit earlier and a bit on edge, but halfway down the stairwell he stopped. No sound of running water, no footsteps, no roar of engines outside the window. It was never this quiet, not even at night.

And what about his lunch container? Indeed, he hadn't seen the familiar box in the refrigerator. She hadn't even prepared his lunch!

PARASITE

Or maybe he'd left it in his office while drunk? Didn't matter.



Because of the rising blizzard, nothing could be seen. The right tram was waiting at the stop. The major jumped inside, but quickly realized there was no one there. He jumped back out. Must be some kind of accident — the whole route was standing still. All because of the snow.

After standing there, thinking, stamping his foot in irritation, major Dubinkin set off on foot. He raised his collar to shield himself from the harsh wind.

The streets were empty, no lights burned in the windows, and only snow-dusted cars stood haphazardly along the roads. Apparently, the old major had mixed up the days, and today was a day off — normal people were lying in bed. Oh, that Dubinkin! But there was no turning back when you were almost there.



The major held onto his hat, which the wind kept trying to tear away. He reached the precinct. The ticking of a clock and the sound of the major's footsteps echoed through the corridors. Otherwise, it was empty here as well.

Everyone was resting. The major would work overtime and be better than those slackers, those freeloaders. They'd done right to pack up Taburetka — he'd been the laziest and slipperiest of them all.

There wasn't a single piece of paper on the major's desk. But in the lunch corner he found his container. If only there were some food inside. But who would have put it there?

The major grew sad, but quickly rallied: the cognac was still there, and there was a shot or two left in the bottle.

All right then — in honor of the day off.

Down it went.

The major leaned back in his chair, feet on the desk, hands clasped behind his head. That was how he slept off his quota. Perhaps a bit longer.

He was awakened by snow striking the awning. Major Dubinkin rushed to the window — he thought it was insolent children. A white curtain. You couldn't see the neighboring building. You couldn't even really see the ground.

The major knocked back the last little shot. Stretched. Walked through the offices. No signs of life.

TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK

Returning to his office, the major sat at the desk with a serious expression for a while. Then he spat on the whole thing, signed the logbook at the entrance, and left.



At Natasha's, where the television was still squealing, major Dubinkin swept several cans of beer from the refrigerator, took a smoked herring from the shelf, and grabbed a pack of his favorite cigarettes from the display. He stuffed everything into his pockets. He placed the money into the bowl, next to the previous handful.

The wind was truly vicious now. A real storm, the kind Dubinkin could scarcely remember. The major's face suffered under the icy grit. His mustache was frosted over, as were his eyebrows.



The building entrance was buried in snow. The major couldn't open the door at once — the wind resisted.

No one met him at the threshold of the apartment. On the kitchen floor lay his wife's bamboo slippers and a black shawl; on the table — cold tea. That's it. She'd had it coming.

Major Dubinkin hastily fried some eggs and opened a beer. One can, then another, then a third. He crushed them and tossed them onto the floor. Between them, he smoked.

And yet... who had taken her?.. Or what if she'd left on her own? After all those years together. What if he was no longer needed by her? No, that wouldn't do! He'd relaxed... grown weak... allowed himself pity, allowed himself memories.

The major sighed. Scratched his head, yawned. Went to the bathroom. Washed his face, brushed his teeth. Pulled a strange hair from his chin. Trimmed his mustache.

A scrap of paper lay on the side table in the living room. Oh Lord, oh Lord...

Major Dubinkin opened the wardrobe and took out his dress uniform — pressed, always ready to wear, kept in a special cover. A white shirt; the regulation deep-black jacket and trousers with red piping; a silk tie; a belt with a golden emblem and matching golden epaulettes. The major put it all on.

After combing his hair in the mirror, he sat down on the couch and took out his handcuffs. He brought his hands behind his back.

A bookcase in an espresso stain

Kitchen cabinets in what looks like natural oak with dark/black granite countertops

The TV stand and side table have iron handles. 

The kitchen cabinets have polished nickel handles.

Today's Pick: **Jaylen Brown 3+ Three Pointers**

**$DKNG**: **+149**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.49U

League: Boston Celtics vs Utah Jazz (8PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: Not going to bitch about this one! I got what I wanted it and loss by a mile! But not the result I wanted obviously lol. If this was another bad beat I would be self sabotaging these POTDs but that wasn't a bad beat, so I'm going to keep firing value wagers. Gotta hit one of these, right? If it loses I just hope it's not in a  bad beat fashion. **But I really could have made you guys rich yesterday if I did went the sabotaging way and took the Falcons ML lol. I knew that Rams was square money all week leading up to the game.**

**Matchup:** I would assume that everyone will be on Jaylen Brown 30+ Points today. If you don't kno he is tryna pass the Celtics legend Larry Bird for most consecutive C's to score 30+ Points. Currently Brown is tied wit Bird for 9 consecutive games of 30 or more points a game. I think Jaylen does it, but I hate the odds on this line. It's been wager so much that linesmakers are forced to elevate his line and juice this current line. But as you kno there are so many ways to handicap a wager, especially a player prop. You don't have to take a chance at -170 odds on him to score 30+ and you all kno that I don't wager anything above -140 on a single bet. **If you are constantly paying the vig and avoiding plus money odds, you are going to lose more money over time. Always look for value, that's how you get an edge against the house instead of the other way around.** So today the way I am handicapping Jaylen Brown is taking over his three's line. Yes, I am very aware that he completely bricked the last Jazz matchup (**Went 0 for 9 on 11/3/25**), but I like his chances tonite. He's going for the record and he's going to put up a lot of volumes. All I am asking is three 3-pointers to go into the hoop. He's going to shoot regardless so why not get the record beyond the arc?

Plus, the Jazz gives up 3rd most 3-pointers in the league. They really don't guard much in beyond the arc.

https://preview.redd.it/2cyq5y7seeag1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=4903d730371a502014d7b43c4c310bfb9e22b84b

Other than the fact that Jazz give up ton of three pointers, there really isn't a great stats favoring this line, but sometimes you just gotta against the trend/stats and go wit your gut. I think he at least make 3 threes. **Jaylen has not hit this line in 5 consecutive games, but I think he is due because of the matchup and the narrative**. All I want is a chance here!

1pzsskt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pzsskt/flexor_tendon_injury_what_to_expect/,Flexor Tendon Injury - What to Expect,"Hello! 

Back in September (around the first week to be exact), I bumped into my counter while holding a glass cup. It completely shattered and part of the cup actually went into the bottom of my right ring finger where it connects to my palm, cutting my flexor tendon. I saw a hand specialist about 4 weeks later and he told me it was partially torn and that it would most likely heal on its own but advised me to start physical therapy. He also said to avoid lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup.

I went back about 6 weeks later and he told me I could stop physical therapy and resume normal activities but avoid doing anything extreme. He did say if I still felt pain after Christmas to come back in to have it looked at. I did continue physical therapy as I was worried about it not healing properly and I wanted the best chance at getting my hand back to normal.

Since that appointment, I have seen a huge improvement in the range of motion, previously I was only able to move it about halfway down towards my palm and now I can move it all the way down with some slight pain. The issue I am having is the strength in my finger has not improved and it still hurts constantly. I’ve stopped going to physical therapy because I was doing the same exercises every week and couldn’t go up in weight ever because it hurt too much. I’ve incorporated stress balls into my daily routine and tried to build some strength but it’s honestly so painful that I can’t do it. I consistently wake up in the middle of the night to throbbing pain where I cut my finger. If I hold anything remotely heavy for too long, I am in worse pain for a few days after. I made an appointment to see my doctor in late January (earliest they had) but I am curious to know where it might go. Is my hand going to be like this for longer? What treatments are they able to do?

Additionally, I have felt like my doctor has dismissed my concerns a bit. Obviously I don’t know what treatments are out there so I want to know if this is normal for a tendon injury or if I should be pushing for better answers.

Appreciate your help in advance!

Although I have landed a handful of interviews, the only work I've had since graduation is a part time math-camp teaching job at my university, as well as a part time retail position.

  
I don't know if it's me, my resume, the city (Toronto), or the job market, but being so underemployed, underutilizing my degree, feels awful. This new year, I want to try taking some new approaches to getting where I want, which is in a stable career somewhat relevant to what I studied in school or tangential to my personal interests.

Here are some paths I've considered:

\- Getting some sort of certification to add onto my resume, such as SQL or in ML

\- Dipping my toes into finance by taking some online courses (I have a visceral knee jerk reaction to this idea though, since I hate learning about finance)

\- Enrolling in a masters for data science or computer science at another university.

\- Moving in with my parents in the United States and exploring the American job market (I'm a dual citizen, but prefer living in Canada)

\- Pursuing some completely random career in the trades, aviation, teaching, or anything else that I have had minimal exposure to. Just to try something totally different.

  
For those who want more details about my background and what I've done besides applying to positions, here are some additional facts:

  
\- Since graduation I created a data analytics project in Python that uses SQLite to access and merge global population, health, and lifestyle data from multiple different datasets. I usually include it in my resume

\- I have a strong interest in computer science, although I only took a handful of courses during my undergrad. I am pretty skilled at Blender and 3D graphics, and have a hobbyist interest in game design and development.

\- I have a 3D printer and CAD experience that I've used to create commissions, functional prints, figurines, and cosplay props. My dad keeps telling me I ought to start a side hustle but idk how to get started.",1,1767126110.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1pzskqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloggers/comments/1pzskqv/foods_that_help_or_harm_your_teeth/,Foods That Help or Harm Your Teeth,"# Dentist in Pune

Your smile is not only an indicator of good oral health but also exposes your daily menu. It is trying to say that brushing and flossing, which are basics for dental health, go together with your diet as a powerful tool in the fight against weak teeth and unhealthy gums.  
Enamel can be fortified; bacteria can be fought and good gums can be promoted by some foods. The other category of foods, however, is the one that can cause cavities, enamel erosion, and tooth decay. Understanding the difference benefits you by allowing you to make better food choices for a more vibrant and healthier smile.  
Tooth-friendly and tooth-harming foods are listed in this complete guide, along with tips on how to adjust your diet for the best oral health.

# Foods That Help Your Teeth

First, we will talk about the good news. It is a fact that there are a lot of tasty, tooth-friendly foods which contribute to mouth health and cleanliness and also help avoid cavities.

# 1. Dairy Products (Milk, Cheese, Yogurt)

Dairy is a dental superfood! Milk, cheese, and yogurt are rich in calcium and phosphorus, essential minerals that strengthen tooth enamel and bones. In addition to giving out calcium, cheese also helps neutralize the acid in the mouth and therefore the risk of cavities is reduced.

**Tip:** Have a little piece of cheese after eating to support the natural [pH balance](https://www.healthline.com/health/ph-imbalance) of your mouth.

# 2. Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables (Apples, Carrots, Celery)

These foods perform the function of natural toothbrushes. Their crunchiness not only helps cleaning the teeth by removing the bacteria and food particles but also activates the saliva production which is the body’s natural defense against decay.

Especially apples, carrots, and celery are good because:

* They help in increasing the flow of saliva.
* Massage the gums.
* Freshen your breath naturally.

**Tip:** Include a few crispy fruits or vegetables to your lunch as a smile-friendly snack.

# 3. Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale, Lettuce)

Leafy greens are all vitamin and mineral powerhouses yet calorie and sugar-free heroes. They supply calcium, folic acid, and B vitamins which contribute to hard tissues and gums being healthy.

**Tip:** You can introduce spinach or kale into your salads, smoothies, or wraps to get a vitaline boost.

# 4. Nuts and Seeds (Almonds, Walnuts, Sesame Seeds)

Nuts and seeds are very affluent sources of calcium, magnesium, and healthy fats all needed for setting up potent teeth. Their mastication also leads to increased saliva flow, which in turn, cleanses the mouth and counteracts acids.

**Tip:** Go for unsalted, sugar-free nuts as the healthiest choice.

# 5. Green Tea and Herbal Teas

Green tea is rich in polyphenols, which are natural compounds that possess capabilities to kill or suppress bacteria and reduce inflammation. As a result, these factors contribute to the prevention of plaque formation, bad breath, and gum disease.

**Tip:** For maximum benefits, it is best to drink your tea plain without sugar or honey.

# 6. Water

Water is the best friend of your mouth. It washes away food leftovers, makes acids less strong, and keeps the saliva production going. Even fluoridated water helps the enamel get back its minerals, hence, protecting the teeth from decay.

**Tip:** Always carry a water bottle with you during the day to keep yourself hydrated and prevent cavities.

# 7. Foods Rich in Vitamin C (Oranges, Kiwi, Strawberries)

Vitamin C indeed fortifies the gum tissue and cuts down on the swelling, thereby stopping gingivitis and bleeding gums from occurring.

**Tip:** These fruits can be eaten moderately and mouth rinsing should follow as they are good for the body; however, if their acids are left on the teeth for a long time, they might soften the enamel.

# 8. Foods with Phosphorus (Fish, Eggs, Lean Meat)

Phosphorus is a partner to calcium in the enamel’s rebuilding and protecting process. Fish, eggs, and lean meat are the sources of this important mineral that is needed for the health of both teeth and bones.

**Tip:** Incorporate salmon or chicken into your dishes for a strong protein boost and a protective effect on your teeth as well.

# Foods That Harm Your Teeth

Your smile is supported by some foods, while others have a negative impact on your enamel, gums, and general oral health without you even being aware of it. Here are the warning signs.

# 1. Sugary Snacks and Sweets

Tooth decay is mainly caused by candy, cookies, cakes, and chocolates. The power of the bacteria in your mouth is able to eat sugar and produce acid as a byproduct. This acid actually dissolves enamel and gives rise to cavities.

Sticky or chewy candies are especially harmful because they cling to teeth and are hard to wash away.

**Tip:** In case of a sweet tooth, brush or rinse your mouth immediately after consuming sugar.

# 2. Soft Drinks and Sugary Beverages

Soft drinks, sports drinks, and flavored juices are high in sugar and acids that detrimentally affect the health of your enamel. Acidic components are also present in diet sodas, which can make your teeth weaker over time.

**Tip:** Cut down on sugary drinks and have water instead. If you must drink soda, try to use a straw so that it touches your teeth the least.

# 3. Starchy Foods (Chips, Bread, Pasta)

Mouth quick sugar the arrival of refined starches that invariably assault with the help of bacteria which are made so stickily tucked away between the teeth.

**Tip:** Switch to whole grains and use dental floss after you consume starchy meals.

# 4. Acidic Foods and Drinks (Citrus Fruits, Vinegar, Tomatoes)

Citrus fruits, being loaded with vitamin C, can, however, cause enamel erosion when consumed in high quantities, resulting in tooth sensitivity and cavities.

**Tip:** Tooth brushing should not be done right after the intake of acidic food; a pause of at least 30 minutes is required in order not to brush softened enamel away.

# 5. Alcohol and Coffee

Both alcohol and coffee can cause your mouth to become dry which will eventually decrease saliva production thus leading to bad breath, staining, and decay. However, coffee is particularly the one that contains tannins which will eventually cause yellowing of your teeth.

**Tip:** It is advisable to drink water along with coffee or alcohol, and also to rinse your mouth afterward.

# 6. Sticky and Dried Fruits (Raisins, Dates, Figs)

Though natural, dried fruits are concentrated sources of sugar and often cling to your teeth. They can be as harmful as candy if not cleaned properly.

**Tip:** Eat dried fruits with a meal rather than as a snack, and rinse or brush after eating.

# 7. Ice and Hard Candies

Chewing on hard substances like ice or candies can crack or chip your teeth, especially if you have fillings or dental restorations.

**Tip:** Avoid crunching on hard objects they can cause small fractures that lead to sensitivity and decay.

# Creating a Tooth-Friendly Diet

Oral and general health are supported by a balanced diet. A good meal plan can help your teeth stay strong:

1. **Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods** — calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins are very important for both enamel and gums.
2. Limit sugar and acid exposure by choosing water and whole foods.
3. **Snack smart** — instead of sweets, go for nuts, cheese, or crunchy veggies.
4. **Stay hydrated** — saliva is the body’s natural way of fighting against cavities.
5. **Maintain regular dental checkups** — the dentist can detect early signs of erosion or decay that are caused by diet.

# The Connection Between Diet and Oral Health

Your mouth is the initial point of contact for all the food you eat. In due time, unhealthy eating habits might cause:

* Enamel erosion
* Tooth sensitivity
* Gum inflammation
* Cavities and decay
* Discoloration

On the contrary, the decision to consume nutrient-rich foods can:

* Strengthen enamel
* Nourish oral pH
* Prevent plaque deposition
* Gum health support
* Smile enhancement

A mouth that is healthy usually reflects a healthy body and your diet is the main connector between them.

# Conclusion

Your teeth have been designed to take the load of a lifetime, but your diet can account for the whole difference. The intake of foods that are rich in calcium, vitamins, fiber, and especially water gives the strongest defense to your gums and teeth; conversely, the intake of sugar, starch, and acid in excess can cause lasting damage.

The decision of wise food choices plus the regular dental check-ups will not only secure for you the great delicacies but also the inner delights of the immaculate cavity-free smile.

# FAQs About Foods and Dental Health

1. **Can what I eat really affect my teeth?**

Absolutely. Your diet influences enamel strength, gum health, and cavity formation. Calcium-rich, vitamin-rich, and fiber-rich foods are beneficial for tooth protection while the opposite is true for sugary or acidic foods.

1. **How often should I eat sugary foods?**

The best course of action is to limit them as much as possible. In case you have to, it is advisable to consume sweets together with your main meal. A mouth rinse afterward will also be helpful in reducing acid damage.

1. **Are all fruits safe for my teeth?**

Fresh fruits are good for you, but citrus and dried ones are acidic and contain sugar. So, if you are going to have them, then moderation is the key and also mouth rinsing after eating is recommended.

1. **How does water help my teeth?**

Water is the best option as it is able to remove food debris, counteract acids and maintain saliva flow which is the main reason for the enamel’s protection.

1. **Does drinking coffee or tea stain teeth?**

Yes, the two beverages have tannins and these are the ones responsible for discoloration. By rinsing your mouth with water and getting the teeth professionally cleaned, you can still white up the stains a bit.

1. **Can diet reverse tooth decay?**

Cavities cannot be treated just with diet, but the damage would be stopped. Visiting your dentist for check-ups and getting fluoride treatments are also very important.

1. **How can I make my diet more tooth-friendly?**

Eating calcium-rich foods, not taking sweets too often and drinking lots of water are some ways you can maintain a healthy mouth. Also, don’t forget to see your teeth doctor for professional advice regularly.

At the Christmas dinner (we had it earlier this year than normal), I had drunk three beers beforehand, since it was supposed to be alcohol-free. I didn’t feel it was much. I had barely slept, I felt unwell, and it felt like the only way I could manage to be there.

But when “everyone” knows about my problems, they become hyper-focused on me. I was told that my sister-in-law had said to others: “She’s definitely not sober.”

I was not intoxicated. I had three beers — and I stuck to soda and coffee for the rest of the day and evening.

That side of the family has now started to avoid me in all kinds of ways. The way they speak to me, they don’t respond on Snapchat, or to things I share on Snap/Facebook, etc. — things they always did before. They maybe open snaps, but not respond etc

I know I shouldn’t have drunk, of course. But I also have poor health, and I truly wanted to be part of the gathering. It felt impossible without having 1–2 beforehand.

I’m sad and I feel turned away from. And I find that very painful, especially now that I’ve been open about my problems and have sought treatment.

In other words, I had hoped for a bit more understanding and support in this struggle — especially when I am actually doing something about it. I don’t want to live like this, and I don’t want to hurt my family or anyone else.

How do I move forward? I am in treatment now, but it really starts properly after the New Year.

I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I am in pain, and it doesn’t help when people just turn their backs on me (without even talking to me about the problems).

I have so much anxiety that I don’t even know if I dare to see anyone in the family at all — especially when my mother has shared all my problems with absolutely everyone.

I feel like I just want to isolate myself completely… shame… anxiety…

I hope they will support me 😢 and see that I am at least trying… and understand that it’s normal to have some “slip-ups” from time to time.

How do I cope with this? 💔😢😢 im so sad",0,1767125685.0,alcoholism,0,0.5,False

I am hoping to meet new people in the city for all kinds of fun plans—whether it’s a game night, couples night out, dinner parties, going together to a musical or just catching a movie together (we both have AMC A-List).

A little about me: I was born and raised in Spain, and now live in Brooklyn, with my wife. I work as a high school teacher in the Bronx, where I teach advanced Spanish classes, and I hold a Ph.D. in Hispanic Literature with a focus on comics and graphic novels.

I’ve been passionate about comics since I was a kid and still try to read a little (almost) every day. Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed between work and my master’s studies, so I’ve found it hard to focus on my usual hobbies. To unwind, I recently got a PS5—something fun to relax with after a long day.

Since I finished my PhD, I have had a hard time meeting people due to the amount of work and the distance from some friends. I have a bit of social anxiety, so I don't really get along with big groups of people, and that has impeded going to meetups and similar things, so I tend to meet in tiny groups. One important thing is that I am liberal, and I would prefer meeting like-minded people.

I’d love to meet others who share similar interests or enjoy good company. If you’re up for hanging out, exploring the city, or even talking comics over coffee, feel free to reach out!

Looking forward to connecting.
