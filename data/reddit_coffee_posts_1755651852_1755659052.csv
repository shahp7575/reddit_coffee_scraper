*Where the Odds Are as Tight as a Salsa Dancer‚Äôs Schedule*

**Parsing the Odds: A Dead Heat More Exciting Than a Draw**  
The numbers scream parity. Both Fenerbah√ße and Benfica sit at near-identical odds: **2.5 (decimal)**, translating to **40% implied win probability** each. The draw? A bloated 3.5 (28.5%), as if bookmakers are gasping at the thought of these teams sharing points. This is a toss-up more thrilling than a coin flip in a hurricane. Spreads are evenÈí±‚Äîno points, just a 1.85-1.89 price range, meaning bettors are being paid almost even money to wager on either side. Totals hover around 2.75 goals, with ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù slightly favored (1.78-1.98). In short: expect a tactical duel, not a fireworks show.

**Digesting the News: Young Blood, Old Souls**  
Both teams boast Colombian prodigies. **Jhon Jader Dur√°n**, Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs 20-year-old forward, is the Turkish league‚Äôs answer to a Colombian coffee bean‚Äîsmall, potent, and keeping everyone awake at night. Meanwhile, **Richard R√≠os**, Benfica‚Äôs midfield maestro, is like a *salsa* dancer with a spreadsheet: equal parts flair and algorithmic precision. Neither has a injury scuppering their plans‚Äîthankfully, no ‚Äútripped over shoelaces‚Äù mishaps here. Benfica‚Äôs Ukrainian goalkeeper **Anatoliy Trubin**? A human paralyzer who turns saves into performance art.

Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs edge? Home advantage at ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium, where the roar is loud enough to wake the Ottoman Empire. Benfica‚Äôs trump card? Their Lisbon return leg, where the humidity is as thick as their history of qualifying drama.

1mv38zh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv38zh,Added some stuff to the Dirty Dodge...,"I added some stuff to the Dirty Dodge pickup. First, I wanted to take some pics with the hood open, and it wouldn't stay up. I made a folding hood support with a piece of craft wire. I drilled a hole in the radiator support, bent the end of the wire at 90 degrees and stuck it through the support. Now the support folds down when not needed, Then the bed looked a bit empty, and the rear was sagging a bit. The tool box and jack actually came with the kit, so I painted them and stuck them in there. Then I dug through my parts box and found the tranny and engine, I filled in the front of the tranny a bit, and added a shaft for some interest. The tranny came from a Mobius Ford Truck kit. Then I built the engine, it came from a Revell hot rod kit. I drilled out the spark plug holes, and intake manifold. I cut the belts off a pulley set, and put the crank and water pump pulley on for a bit of realism. I drilled out the ends and made flanges for the parts box headers cause they didn't quite cover the holes in the heads. I also drilled out the flanges and added pin heads as bolts. The last thing was a dipstick. The engine looked silly just laying in the back, so I built the pallet out of basswood and coffee stirrers. The tie downs were done with Frog tape cut down to size with some craft wire bent to resemble buckles. I might have to make a mini diorama to have something ""to put the engine in"".

# (and Why You Should Care!)

Welcome everyone! Since this is our very first post, let‚Äôs go back to the absolute basics of electronics ‚Äî the stuff that makes your phone glow, your fan spin, and your toaster‚Ä¶ well, toast. 

# 1. Electricity is just‚Ä¶ lazy!

Electrons always want to move from a place of higher energy (voltage) to lower energy. Think of them like people at a wedding buffet ‚Äî rushing from ‚Äútoo much food‚Äù to ‚Äúempty plates.‚Äù That movement? That‚Äôs current. 

# 2. The Trio of Power: V = I √ó R

This is the *Ohm‚Äôs Law*. Voltage (V) pushes, Current (I) flows, Resistance (R) slows it down. Imagine water in a pipe: Voltage is water pressure, Current is the flow, and Resistance is the narrowness of the pipe. Except, unlike water, electricity can shock you into remembering the formula forever. 

# 3. Components are Like Characters in a Sitcom

* **Resistors**: The strict parents (they limit everything).
* **Capacitors**: The chill ones storing energy for later.
* **Diodes**: The bouncers at the club ‚Äî only letting current in one way.
* **Transistors**: The dramatic ones ‚Äî they can switch ON/OFF or amplify like turning up your karaoke mic. 

# Why Learn This?

Because once you get these basics, you can build anything ‚Äî from blinking LEDs to robots that make your coffee (well, someday).

So tell me: What was the **first electronic component** you ever used or broke?",1,1755658340.0,Dynavation,0,1.0,False

1mv34ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mv34ol/fn_after/,[FN] After,"How long have I been sleeping? I don't remember going to the beach, what am I doing here? He stood up slowly, he felt groggy, like when you wake up and then go back to sleep and then wake up an hour later. He was disoriented, but had the sudden urge to walk. It was like there was an invisible force leading his hand, guiding him in the direction he needed to go. The air was crisp and salty, the colors seemed brighter ‚Äì like when he was a child. Focusing on the sound of the beautiful bright blue ocean and taking notice of the occasional seagull that flew by overhead, and basking in the warm glow of the cloudless day, it was the perfect temperature. He did not know how long he had walked for, as he walked he did not grow fatigued, not the slightest bit. Eventually he saw an object far down along the beach, he couldn‚Äôt quite make it out, so he kept walking towards it. What is that? It looks like a person sitting at a desk? He kept walking towards the stranger. Hello sir, wonderful afternoon we're having isn‚Äôt it, the man at the desk said when he made it over to him. Ummmm, sure. Come, have a seat. Anything to drink? Water, coffee, juice? Ummm, I guess I'll have a cup of water. And seemingly out of thin air a water cup appeared in front of him ‚Äì it was as if he had blinked and it was there. He looked at the man sitting across from him to see if he looked just as confused as he was. But the man just smiled at him warmly and began to hurl questions at him. So sir, what is your name? Bailey, he replied. Your parents just stop at Bailey? Bailey Woods. The man wrote something down on the note pad he had on the table in front of him. Alright Mr, Woods and how old are you? I‚Äôm 26, he replied. Great, and do you have any children? No. A spouse or partner perhaps? No. I see, the mysterious man replied. Now then, do you think about death often? Excuse me? Do you think about death often, the man said again. What kind of a question is that? What kind of a question do you think it is, the man asked. A strange one. I see. He wondered how long this strange man would be asking him questions, and more importantly if he would be able to ask any questions of his own. And it was as if the man across from him had peered into his mind. So sir, do you have any questions for me? Yes, where am I? Bailey replied although a little stunned. You are nowhere. I‚Äôm Nowhere? Yes, and everywhere at the same time. How can that be possible? I don‚Äôt know. You don‚Äôt know. You see sir, I don‚Äôt make the rules. You‚Äôre not being very helpful. I am sorry to hear that Mr, Woods, if you would like to, you are more than welcome to lodge a formal complaint and leave it in the complaint box. He looked around the table but could not find any such box. I don‚Äôt see anything that looks like a complaint box, he said. Oh that‚Äôs right I forgot, the box has gone in for repairs. The box has gone in for repairs? Yes Sir. After a couple seconds of defeated silence Bailey spoke. You're not very funny either. Well I happened to think it was quite funny. Now Mr, Woods if you would kindly step into that door over there to your right you will be commited over to processing. And out of nowhere yet again a single oak door appeared on the sand. Okay I‚Äôm starting to get freaked out. It‚Äôs okay sir all of this will make sense soon enough, or it won‚Äôt, that‚Äôs really up for you to decide. Giving the man a concerned look Bailey reluctantly got up from his seat and walked slowly over to the magic door. He looked back at the man with doubt, but he just smiled and gestured for him to open the door and step through it. With one deep breath and a long exhale, he slowly opened the door. There was nothing but black on the other side, he could not tell if he would fall into a bottomless pitch black pit once he stepped through the door. But once again he was compelled to move by a force greater than he could understand, he stepped through the door.¬†

¬†	This time when he woke up he found himself laying on a fallen tree log in the middle of a lush green forest. There was a tall lanky youthful looking woman standing over him. Hello, the woman said in a tone that sounded maternal and comforting. Hello, he replied back. My name is Bailey, he began to say but was quickly cut off by the women. Oh, no, no dear I already know your name you needn‚Äôt tell me. Okay, what is your name then. I go by many names dear, but you may call me Iris. Okay. She held out her hand to him to help him up off the ground. She pulled him to his feet as if he were as light as air, he barely had to do any work at all to stand up. Now then, let's take a walk shall we. She did not wait for a response from him and turned around and began slowly walking away from him. He followed her without a second thought. He didn‚Äôt know how to explain it but he felt that he could trust her. He walked quickly to catch up with the woman. They walked in silence for a few minutes, then he asked, so where are you taking me? You will see soon enough, she replied. Okay. It wasn‚Äôt much of an answer but he accepted it all the same, maybe it was just that he had become accustomed to receiving vague answers at this point. So who are you? I told you already my name is Iris. No but I mean who are you exactly, why are you here helping me? I am your guide, a friend to help you through this process. What process are you talking about exactly? The transfer process, transferred to what? To your next life. He stopped walking for a moment in stunned silence. So wait, what are you saying, are you telling me that I'm‚Ä¶ dead? Yes that's right dear, you are indeed dead. He couldn‚Äôt find the words to speak. Look dear I know that this is a lot to process but we really need to get going, we are on a very tight schedule you see. So am I in heaven right now? No dear, you are just going through what your brain feels like it needs to go though, all people have different experiences after dying, it is not a cookie cutter one size fits all thing. I feel like I should be more freaked out by this. Do you want to be more freaked out? No, I'm just saying that I feel like I should be more freaked out or angry or something, seeing how my life is over, and at such a young age, there was still so much I wanted to do. Like what, she asked. I don‚Äôt know like seeing the grand canyon or going sky diving or maybe having a family, you know shit like that. You can still do all those things in your next life, it just won't be you directly doing those things. Now come dear we are running behind schedule, come walk with me. He once again followed her deeper into the forest. So how did I die? I can't remember a single thing about it. It doesn't matter now, you are dead, your previous life is over and you are moving on to the next, knowing that information will only serve your soul unnecessary turmoil. I still want to know. She responded with only silence, making her stance clear to him. So earlier when you said that I could still do all the things I wanted to do but not directly, what did you mean by that exactly? The human soul is one composed of many from previous lives. So when you move on to your next life, who you were will make up a tiny portion of the next body that will house your soul. Does that answer satisfy you? Yeah, I guess so. Ah, we're finally here. After what seemed like hours, or maybe days, he couldn‚Äôt quite tell, time seemed to move slowly here, it was good for reflection. He could remember everything about his life in perfect detail, even the memories from when he was child that he had forgotten a long time ago, and the things he had tried to forget. And still, the only moment he could not remember was his death, though he tried not to speculate since he knew that no good would come of it anyway. They had arrived at a cliff face overlooking the ocean. It was cold and windy. Dark clouds lined the sky as the sun just barely showed through. The grass was tall and lush. Iris walked closer to the edge of the cliff. He followed her. Alright this is the end for you. The end? Yes, now I want you to jump. You want me to jump? Yes, I want you to run and jump off into the water. Are you crazy? I'll die for sure. But you‚Äôre already dead. Right I know but I just mean that it doesn't make sense. Bailey dear, the dead can‚Äôt die, they can only be born again. So if I jump off this cliff, I'll be reborn as someone completely new? Yes dear that‚Äôs right. Will it hurt, being born? No dear you wont feel a thing. Okay. He was quick to convince because he had no reason not to trust her. And with that he turned around and began to walk back the way he came. He was scared a little bit, but there was something clawing at the back of his head that gave him so much courage it seemed to cancel out that fear entirely. His footsteps felt light. He experienced a kind of clarity he had never felt before. After walking about 20 steps he turned back around again. He looked around for Iris, but like so many things in this strange realm she had vanished. He took one deep breath in filling his entire body, and took a long exhale out. He began to run, he ran with some much conviction and determination, in that moment he felt he could do anything, he knew he had the power to do whatever he put his mind to. Once he approached the edge he lept into the air. Time seemed to move in slow motion. All his inhibitions lifted from his shoulders and he felt relief, he had had no idea how much weight was holding him down all this time, he felt as light as a feather. He felt so much peace. The water crashed against the rocks. He did not feel fear anymore, only the hope swelling inside his chest. He looked out over the sunset, it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. And with that he hit the surface of the water, and was born again.",1,1755658181.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Figured I‚Äôd post my experience to help others who were as confused as me when I tried to plan my trip. I found an itinerary from Reddit that I mainly copied but also took a gander at a bunch of other ones which were similar. Also went off of recs from friends!

For the duration of our stay, we stayed at an Airbnb in Whitefish just because we wanted to stay somewhere lively. We also rented a car and we were only going to take a shuttle if we were unable to snag passes. I would consider myself a good/moderate hiker so keep that in mind when it comes to my experience!

Day 1 (Thu, 8/14): Avalanche Lake
- We landed around noontime. Could not check into Airbnb until 4p so we decided to go avalanche lake.
- Went to folklore coffee prior and to Safeway to stock up on snacks prior to hike. Ôªø
- Had to go through Sun Road after 3p since we did not need passes. We did buy a weekly pass for our vehicle. No lines really to get through.
- ÔªøWas easy to park on site for avalanche.
- The hike itself wasn‚Äôt that hard. I would say maybe moderate to easy imo, it was more like a walk in the woods to me. Clocked in 4.3 miles and a moving time of 1:44.
- ÔªøStopped at lake mcdonald lodge (~20 min from avalanche), didn‚Äôt want to wait for sunset so we went back home.

Day 2 (Fri, 8/15): The Garden Wall via Highline
- ÔªøLeft early AM since we didn‚Äôt reserve tickets to sun road. Arrived to Logan pass by 630a and snagged one of the last parking spots! Beautiful sunrise when we got there!
- Saw a bear and two cubs from afar on the way up. Also saw some deer. Lots of cute marmots.
- Ôªøhighline trail itself is not a bad hike, pretty moderate I want to say, just getting up the garden wall killed me a bit. 
- ÔªøGarden wall: beautiful views up top! Was very windy and cold once sun disappeared. This part was hard ugh! But it‚Äôs totally doable if you pace yourself, which I did not.
- Decided to do the chalet since we were already there. It was ok imo, nothing compared to garden wall. But there‚Äôs smelly toilets and a place to buy snacks/drinks.
- The only thing I hated about this hike was going back it was never ending lmao after having no fuel left. I don‚Äôt think I had enough snacks, had plenty of water though since it wasn‚Äôt hot that day, sprinkled a bit too.
- Clocked 16.7 miles, and a moving time of 7:08.

Day 3 (Sat, 8/17): Three Waterfall Trail
- ÔªøGoes to Baring, St. Mary's and Virginia falls
- Needed Sun road pass that we got night before but left sometime in the afternoon without issue.
- Parked at Sun point per people from AllTrails which we did not have any issues finding or parking.
- This was also more like a nature walk to me. Was a very chill time. First waterfall small, second one medium and very blue!, and third one bigger but was ok, nothing amazing imo since waterfall hikes don‚Äôt really amaze me haha.
- We just wanted to take it easy that day to recover from garden wall. The weather was gloomy anyway so it was chill. The drive back was cloudy and beautiful all around Logan pass! Very twilight-esque.

Day 4 (Sun, 8/17): Grinnell Glacier
- you need a shuttle pass to get to many glacier!
- My two friends and I tried to get tickets right at 7p the night before with no luck! Sold out in seconds. If you keep refreshing though you might get lucky like me! Maybe thirty min after it opened I snagged one for myself, an hour later I snagged another one, and at dinner my friend snagged one ‚Äî we got so lucky and all got for the same time (8-9)!
- There are nine lots you can park at, we parked at #9 because it‚Äôs closest to whitefish (still over two hour drive lmao). However, they start picking up at #9 then reverse. Parking was easy, and was not busy. We got there at 830ish and the shuttle showed up closer to nine. We weren‚Äôt fighting for a seat thank goodness, and the process went smoothly. There were about 45 people by the time we got to many glacier hotel.
- We were able to use the restroom at the hotel and stock up on things if needed.
- Grinnell glacier: did not do boat because it was sold out, but honestly didn‚Äôt need to do it because this hike was a piece of cake compared to garden wall! Clocked 11 miles and moving time of 5:04. I would consider this hike moderate. People said the end was hard, but I think I‚Äôd beg to differ.
- Saw some big horned sheep, goats, and deer along the way. People also saw some moose. I saw snakes every now and then unfortunately ugh.
- The glacier was nice! It got cold as we got closer but nothing intolerable. The trail overall was beautiful, I kept getting distracted by wanting to take pictures at every stop!
- We didn‚Äôt wait too long for a shuttle back either, was not crowded, maybe because it was a Sunday?

Day 5 (Mon, 8/18):
- chill day before leaving after all that hiking!
- We never got to do hidden lake unfortunately but I was ok with it because we did so much hiking and enjoyed them all!
- We ended up getting brunch in whitefish, took the chairlift up whitefish ski resort, did some alpine slides, and went kayaking.
- For dinner we went to Abruzzo for Italian. We highly recommend it!

Overall, great GNP experience. Glad we stayed in whitefish as we always had something to do and it was lively (we like to hike, but we also love to eat and drink out!). The only one negative I would say is that the people we encountered in whitefish were not friendly!

I‚Äôm from a touristy capital and I don‚Äôt use that as an excuse to act like a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and brush people off. We met other people that felt the same, so that was validating haha. It was funny to feel like a fish out of place in whitefish when going to bars and even some of the restaurants, sheesh! But I came for the hiking I suppose, and that did not disappoint!

So a couple of weeks ago my son (6) has a weighted stuff T-rex that you throw in the microwave and it heats up and apparently is very soothing. (It really works for infants and toddlers that are restless at night), anyway, his Rex got a decent rip down the side at the stitches, this thing was NOT cheap and his mom was gonna toss it and save to get another one. I was like oh heck no that sheit was to expensive. So I went and grabbed my sewing kit (yes I, a 38YO man knows how to sew, and I'm pretty good at it free hand, no machine needed) and I opened the box and started pulling the thread out and needles and his mom looked at me like a was the weirdest thing she ever seen. Apparently no one taught her how to preform a sewing task. (That's part one, why have kids not learned how to sew, and cook, what i real vacuumed is,) when I was 13 is was able to pull a 68 SS t transmission and motor out, tear the motor down and rebuild it with little help from my granddad.

Anyway, so I'm sitting there sewing his Rexy, and here comes my little football sized mixed breed dog flying around the living room around my coffee table and using the two sides of the couch like the sloped left hand turns in a NASCAR race. About the time I went to get on to him he found that on the seat of the couch laid my sewing box with 100'S of needles, thimbles, pin cushions, scissors you know everything you need to mend just about anything you can come across. Well he landed on the open top of the box and before I could even blink I saw in slow motion how the dog freaked out because he laned on something hard and noisy, then the other side that's almost slap full get flug over his head like a boulder being released from a catapult. 

Well I cleaned it all up took me almost a hour we'll couple weeks go by and I am in my living room turning everything off ready for bed and I turned to go upstairs..... and I felt a sharp ass pain in my foot. I hobble over the the chair and sure enough I found the last needle in the hay stack.... I hope... The needle went through my sock (of course) into the joint between my big toe and ball of my foot where I had to pull it out quick like ducttape hopping it won't hurt but it still hurts just all at one time. The damn needle was damp near two inches long and only thing sticking out of my foot was the eye of the needle.

TL;DR had a whole box of sewing tools flung over my living room a few weeks ago by my dog, thought I got them all up until tonight when I slide my foot across the the rug where a 2 inches needle went through my toe and damp near into my joint of my big bone.",2,1755658100.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Also, I want in-unit laundry; this is just another one that vastly improves my quality of life. 

I love the Mount Royal Neighborhood but Bluestone is also hard to get into and really expensive, so I would be lucky to catch a 1 bedroom in the middle next month or so.

Last year around October this thing  terrorized me and my family for a few nights. It started with it just bothering me so I thought I was just seeing things, until two of my sisters saw it in the driveway one night while they were taking out the trash. They both ran back inside and we locked the house and for the rest of the night we were scared and heard it outside just walking around, even saw it a few times. We called the cops because we hoped it was some  jerks playing a prank on us, but the cops got here and saw no footprints just animal tracks all around the house. They left, and when we all went to bed I was the only one that slept in my room (my sisters piled up in the living room) and for the rest of the night I heard it tapping against my window and trying to get me to go outside. I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until the sun went up because I was so scared. After that, my mom and sister saged the whole property and some other things I can‚Äôt remember.

Tonight, I went for a walk. The sun was almost down, and I really wanted a coffee so I decided to walk to our local dollar store. It was a thirty-forty minute walk so I knew I could make it before they closed because I‚Äôve done it before. As soon as I‚Äôm out of the driveway and walking up a hill to the main road, I hear something growling and I think it‚Äôs a dog so I keep walking. I start feeling like something‚Äôs following me so I tell myself to just make it the park and I‚Äôll turn back around and lose it on one of the side roads. I‚Äôm texting my friends while this is happening and one of my friend and his mom drives by and asks if I need a ride back home. At this point I‚Äôm basically home and I figured their car scared it off so I tell them I‚Äôm okay and that I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience but I‚Äôm almost home so I don‚Äôt need it anymore. They turn back around and the moment their cars out of sight I turn and it‚Äôs standing just out of view of the street lamp. It was grey and had weird human animal face with wide eyes that looked sunken in and it looked angry. It was in the position a frog gets in before it jumps for something.

I run so fast and I turn the ten minute walk home into a six minute run and I don‚Äôt stop, I didn‚Äôt even know I fell until my sister pointed out my stained pajamas pants and asked if I fell. I know it followed me home because even after I got inside my dogs were still barking like crazy and start up again every few minutes.

From a workers perspective - is this strange? Should I make the order with a cashier instead of the kiosk so they dont think I am freeloading? Am I worrying about nothing?

I ask because I rarely see people bringing their own mug even though I am in LA. At the same time, sometimes there are not even workers at the cash register to take your order, so putting in the order at the kiosk is the only option. ",2,1755657802.0,Panera,1,1.0,False

I just moved back to India and have been pretty unhappy with the waters I‚Äôve tried for coffee brewing so far. 

I‚Äôve used my home RO system (it produces a TDS of roughly 70 ppm though I don‚Äôt know the composition) and I just tried Kinley bottled water (measured about 59 ppm).

I‚Äôm more flexible with Magnesium and Calcium levels and don‚Äôt mind anywhere between 0 and 90 ppm.

Before I get the Zero Water jug, what do you guys turn to for everyday use? I‚Äôd be grateful if you have recommendations for suppliers of food grade distilled water, especially if they‚Äôll allow me to use refillable containers.

I know that Aquafina water used to measure close to 0 TDS but I think for various reasons that brands like these with very low TDS have changed their compositions to fit the range 50-150 ppm.

Update to the post below. 

I had my surgery on May 20th. I won‚Äôt lie, the week-2weeks after sucked for me. I couldn‚Äôt swallow anything. Even water was a struggle. My wedding was this summer so the only perk is that I lost 10 pounds very fast lol 
After the first 2 weeks, I could eat yogurt and protein shakes. 

I was able to start eating real food about a month after but it was a very slow process.


My first meal where I could eat without ‚Äúwashing‚Äù each bite down with water‚Ä¶ was two weeks ago lol. And even sometimes I still have to take a sip between bites. It‚Äôs encouraged me to slow down and up my water intake but basically I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt plan a fun food tour for a while post op.

Now the good stuff- I can burp like a champ. Multiple times a day. Deep ones too. They feel like they come from my toes LOL. If this procedure ever failed me, 1000% I would go back and do it again. Even though my recovery sucked. 

Life is so great now and I love fizzy drinks. I broke up with my heating pad that I used to use every night at 7pm onwards for my bloating/abdominal discomfort.

Botox completed yesterday with BVI (Hoesli)

Hi!! 
I had my Botox done yesterday in Chicago with Dr Hoesli. Firstly, what a fricken angel. She is the most kind, personable Dr I have ever had the privilege of meeting. 

The nasal scope truly isn‚Äôt horrible as long as you calm down. I have anxiety and I did amazing. In fact, it‚Äôs super neat to learn deeper into your anatomy. 

I spoke with her about doing 100 units vs the typical 75 as I am from Canada and our dollar sucks right now lol so I wanted to decrease the chances of failure. So she agreed after explaining the increased side effects (slow swallow etc) 

My surgery went well! I believe she mentioned my esophageal anatomy being thick? And so I woke up with a sore throat that I wasn‚Äôt super prepared for lol I would say worse than a cold that others have mentioned here. However, 5/6 hours post op, it was manageable and I was talking the rest of the 8 hour drive home. 

Zero throat discomfort today! I was drinking some coffee and had my first burp!! I cried. So I started chugging Coke lol annnd burped more. I am so pumped, however, very full and bloated now so maybe don‚Äôt get over excited like I was and chug pop right after your first burp lol. I also have gurgles now.

The topic came to mind so I‚Äôm just letting it out. I‚Äôm a girl in my mid 20s and found out a couple years ago that I‚Äôm ace. When I reflected on if I had ever experienced sexual attraction it was partly inspired by being the only girl in my high school friend group to not be dating, have a crush, or having/wanting sex. We all started to grow apart but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that me not expressing an interest in boys (bc to my knowledge at the time they were all straight) partially contributed to me becoming an outsider in the group. Like they‚Äôd go on double dates and few had ditched the group to eat at the place where their crush was going to be not inviting the rest of us and I didn‚Äôt get why‚Ä¶ including some of them having sex in their car. It sounds terrible but I didn‚Äôt understand what to ask to I guess show support for my friends dating and regarding sex I didn‚Äôt want to hear about it in detail.

Most of my close friends now are guys. (Obviously not attracted to them and only one knows I‚Äôm asexual. Funny enough told him the first time we met.) It kinda just ended up that way. And it‚Äôs interesting bc only one of them talks about sex with me and he appreciates it bc he can‚Äôt openly talk about it with his other friends. (Now I recognize that I‚Äôm comfortable hearing about it but not in too much detail. I guess just as a concept or idea idk.)
The one girl I thought might be my girl friend forever, I told her to block a guy that was being dumb. (She gave hints and finally asked him to grab coffee to get to know each other more and he said what do you mean. I thought that was a fucking stupid response.) I essentially told her to not waste her time on him, but she I guess had a big crush on him that I didn‚Äôt understand bc she doesn‚Äôt show her emotions. Soon after including it being not the healthiest of friendships we stopped talking to each other. I think she wanted like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs girl‚Äù type of friend who would encourage her to keep pursuing, but I guess I don‚Äôt display that well. 

I‚Äôm not the best at texting, so I‚Äôm not the best at maintaining friends. I‚Äôm trying to do better. It seems like my current friends don‚Äôt mind me randomly hitting them up out of the blue to check in and see what they‚Äôre up to. I just sometimes worry about making and maintaining friends who are girls because I‚Äôm not into dating and having sex despite being open to support their experiences. (I think I have a better idea now of what I should be asking/saying.) I just think (allo) girls get excited to talk about such topics, but not me bc I have nothing to talk about.

And I am fully over any thoughts of him but more stuck on how awful I was to him for no reason even though my friends think I‚Äôm overthinking. 

He initially dm‚Äôd me 3yrs ago saying he never really does this but thought I was beautiful and loved my work (I have a public business profile) and would love to get to know me. I (27F - at the time 24F) had never really had a serious relationship and mostly am a man hater and like to pour into myself, my female friendships and my work unless someone worth my time approaches me. Am someone who is content in being single. 

I didn‚Äôt reply but requested to follow/accepted to see his account. He seemed decent. I then forgot about the dm. He then swiped up on some of my stories which is when I finally replied to his dm saying I appreciated how upfront he was from the get go rather than beating around the bush with silly dms etc. but I am not really one to get to know people online and prefer irl. He said okay I understand and jokingly ‚ÄúI now have to stage a run in at a coffee shop‚Äù to which I said if we ever naturally run into each other I‚Äôd happily grab a coffee. (1st rejection I guess)

A couple months later he replied to my story wishing me happy holidays and we started having friendly conversation. It was nice, nothing extraordinary but normal nice friendly conversation. But I‚Äôm horrible at texting and busy so I‚Äôd barely reply properly and admit he was carrying the conversation. He then suggested we do a phone call (1-2ish weeks into texting) which I said no to. 2 days later I found myself struggling to keep up with texting and suggested a phone call to which he agreed to same evening. We spoke for an hour. It was okay, not bad, we could be friends, again friendly banter but I realised we come from very different backgrounds (I have strict ethnic parents who would never stand for that) he was also overly sarcastic which I found annoying. He made a few sarcastic ‚Äújokes‚Äù that didn‚Äôt land well with me. (In hindsight I was also afraid of any commitment at the time) The next day I opened my chat with him, his last message was an apology for not texting me right after the call and asking to move the convo out of insta. I replied to this message with it was nice getting to know him but I don‚Äôt see this progressing past friendship. He tried to suggest a meet up irl to see the vibes irl saying first calls can be awkward but he thought it went well but I was insistent and said I didn‚Äôt feel anything on the call and removed him from my insta. (2nd rejection) atp my reasoning in my head was his family background + his height (I am quite tall) 

2 years later he dmd me out of the blue asking if I was still single (jokingly). I had been thinking about how dismissive ?? I was to him so decided to reply. We got talking again and he asked me to remind him how many siblings I have again. This pissed me off!! Like if you don‚Äôt remember, just scroll up ?? Was he trying to be non chalant?? To this I replied ‚ÄúBE SO FOR REAL RN‚Äù in response to which he started calling my phone (he clearly still had my number saved). I didn‚Äôt pick up. I suggested a meet up. I told him I am bad at texting and it caused misunderstanding. I run a busy business and don‚Äôt have time to waste. He said sure but he was going away so it would be after he was back and I said fine but until then let‚Äôs not text. Suddenly he said he‚Äôd carve out time the day before his trip to meet me (2 days from the text). I was taken aback but asked where he‚Äôd like to meet. We live around 3hrs away from each other, he suggested a city in the middle. But north of the city which is much closer to him and it was mini golf which is sort of dating hot spot for young school couples ??? Which gave me the ick because me and my girlfriends dine in the nicest of places for a casual catch up..I suggested the north of the city was too far for me, can we do east of the city and he said travelling from north to east is so far, he might as well drive to another city‚Ä¶ bearing in mind I was coming from another city. That made me quite angry and was a clear sign that this man wasn‚Äôt for me. Especially in my culture, men are expected to court women from the get go. This was giving low effort. My mistake was, I wasn‚Äôt immediately transparent with him and instead said I‚Äôd check my schedule and see if I can make it and let you know. He then replied actually let‚Äôs just meet when I‚Äôm back, it‚Äôll be much easier. I then sat on my thoughts for a day and sent him a long message saying my initial thoughts were right (2yrs ago) and I don‚Äôt think this will work. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with him, we just won‚Äôt be a good match. To which he replied saying it‚Äôs my decision but he feels I never gave him a real chance or ‚Äúprove his value‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt standing by my word of how texting isn‚Äôt great to get to know people and we should meet. I removed him from my profile immediately. (3rd rejection)

A few days later he sent me a video from a wedding he was attending during his holiday of the decor and music ??? I found this so odd. He wasn‚Äôt even in it, it was just the camera panning with a sad song playing in bg??? What did this mean? Upon seeing this I blocked him.

Figured I'd do my best to help and let people know the details of how I clawed my way out of cirs. 

In terms of treatment the soild ground work i laid comes back to my new home it was built in 2024 and is on a flat slab with no crawlspaces this is key because the construction and design determines how the house will fair over the years it stays standing. Property built on a flat slab is harder to turn moldy because water cannot get under the house and into the floor, I also keep air circulation via open windows and a few fans going on low to make sure air exchange occurs everyday. 

In terms of csm I used a compounded form with no additives and I paired that with coffee enemas and alpha lipoc acid because it helps clear the liver and bile ducts this is key to detox. If the ducts are clogged up and bile isn't flowing detox will take forever or perhaps not even occur at all. Get a coffee thats toxin tested and safe dont buy shit off the shelf at the supermarkets. Also get a cheap enema kit off ebay mine was 30 aud. Do them once or twice a week while taking 3g of csm twice a day. Also stay home as much as possible and order your stuff online or have a friend or family member act on your behalf stay out of public buildings or if you must use a P2 mask and be quick you dont want to hang around in suspicious buildings you know nothing about while u are sick. 

A few other key bits of information and things i did that worked well...

I went full carnivour just meat and eggs cooked all food at home in animal fat and only drank water with Celtic salt in it, this helped massively and is very safe but unpleasant for the first couple weeks as the body falls into ketosis and detoxes from sugar addiction and the other crap in our food system. 

I used alot of basic supplements here's my list. 

1. Methylated b vitamin complex
2. High dose fish oil 2000mg per capsule 
3. L-glutamine powder mixed in water for gut health 
4. Alpha lipoc acid to clear the liver along side coffee enemas, this makes csm work better due to clearing the pipes so to speak.
5. Magnesium citrate and glycinate for bowel movements and muscle relaxation
6. Celtic salt its full of minerals and keeps you hydrated when mixed in water 
7. Sleep teas for aiding sleep. I used a mix and variety of teas to knock me out for sleep I still had a night here or there where I was dealing with insomnia but for the most part I'd make the tea so strong is was like a sedative. Anything with lemon grass and camomile works well.


MARCONS. 
I never had a issue with this but collidial silver plus EDTA is the goto no body uses BEG spray much anymore due to the increasing resistance from the bacteria. The edta breaks the biofilm and the silver kills it. May take weeks for some people or months for others. All depends on the state of your immune system. 

VIP (VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE) 
this is a 26 amino acid neuro polypeptide from the glucagon secretin super family and is produced naturally in the body of humans and other mammals. Its found in the brain and various organs and its effects are multifaceted. It also regulates alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone, when you get sick with cirs VIP and MSH drop to undetectable levels and this causes a massive downstream cascade of dysregulation in the body. 

VIP therapy is done once you complete the following. 

1. Move to a clean house 
2. Detox with CSM 
3. Clear marcons

Once thats all done along with lifestyle changes like diet and using supportive supplements along the way over a few months vip can be started. I used 20mcg a day to start to make sure I didn't react. Once that was established I moved quite fast to 40mcg then 60mcg and now 100mcg a day and I'll be going as high as 400mcg a day. This is to reverse the epigenetic changes caused by cirs. This in turn gives me back my tolerance so I can be in borderline dodgy environments again and dont have to live under a rock the rest of my life. Most people can achieve this to varying degrees depending on your HLA gene. I have a mold only gene so I'm lucky, other people that are multi susceptible are harder to get to this stage but it can be done. 

A few other notes about my journey...

I never really used cirs doctors I did 90% of this myself all I really had consistently was a regular GP to give me the scripts each month. 

Everything i took that required a script was compounded and my supplements came from my local health shop. 

I lived in mold for just over a year before I could move and start treatment this was key as acting fast improved my rate of healing. Others that have longer term exposure also have more damage which means healing takes longer but if you stick to it you will get results. The house I came from was a hertsmi-2 of 30 thats 3 times the cut off, the house im in now is a hertsmi-2 of 2. 

I hope all this helps I know its hard and its bullshit that this happens to people but remember the immune system is built off the back of millions of years of evolution and natural selection, just because your body doesn't do well with fungus doesn't mean it's broken. The immune system makes a trade off, you trade off the ability to deal with fungus for the ability to fight off other pathogens better than most that have been issues in the past for alot of us. Cirs is a new situation because mankind didn't always own houses like we did today thus making our run ins with mold rare for most of our existence. There is more studies and emerging recognition in the medical world about cirs than ever before and this silent epidemic will be uncovered in due course. 

Best regards be safe and get well.

1mv2sgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1mv2sgo/heres_how_we_cut_our_geocoding_costs_by_90/,Here's how we cut our geocoding costs by 90%,"Have you experienced sticker shock from your Google Maps Platform billing recently? I reviewed our startup's AWS costs during the previous month until I almost inhaled my [coffee.Google](http://coffee.Google) Maps APIs: **$4,847**. For a pre-revenue product with 50K MAU. The total cost of address autocomplete and geocoding services adds up quickly.I solved this problem by following these steps to preserve user experience.

**Google maps pricing hits real**

We need to perform a fast calculation of Google's current pricing structure.

**Address Autocomplete (Places API)**:

The pricing structure for this service costs $2.83 for every 1,000 requests (session-based).

* Average user triggers 8-12 autocomplete requests per search
* Cost per completed address: \~$0.025

**Geocoding API**:

* $5.00 per 1K requests
* Every form submission needs lat/lng conversion The cost per geocode is $0.005.

**For a growing app with 50K MAU**:

The monthly address search volume of 200K would cost $5,000.

The monthly cost for 150K geocoding requests would be $750.

The total monthly cost amounts to $5,750.

**The search for alternatives**

I evaluated several options:

**MapBox**

* the cost is slightly lower than $3K+/month at our scale.
* The API design follows good practices and maintains similar integration complexity.
* The verdict is better, but nothing out of this world.

**OpenStreetMap + Nominatim**

* Free to use, self-hosted option available
* The data quality produces irregular results particularly for address information.
* The verdict is that it is great for hobby projects but risky for production.

**Here Maps**

The company does not provide enterprise-focused pricing because it does not offer quotes for our volume.

* **Verdict**: Nope

**Radar**

* $0.50 per 1K requests across all APIs The system maintains the same accuracy level as Google does when processing US address information.
* **Verdict**: 90% cost reduction

**Comparison**

Here's the before/after for address autocomplete:

**Google Places Autocomplete approach**: The system needs two distinct API requests to perform autocomplete suggestions and geocoding coordinate operations.The pricing model of session-based pricing charges users for each keystroke they make and requires extra API requests to obtain full location information.

**Radar Search Autocomplete approach**: Single API call returns formatted addresses with coordinates [included.No](http://included.no/) session-based pricing means you only pay for completed searches, not user interactions.The integration process becomes simple because it automatically includes coordinate information.

**The real world data results**

**Before (Google Maps)**:

* The monthly cost of this plan amounts to $4,847.
* The integration process needed two days to finish because it included both session token management and billing configuration.
* The geocoding process needs additional steps for most applications.

**After (Radar)**:

* Monthly cost: $487 ‚Äî 90% reduction!
* The integration period will last for 4 hours.
* The coordinates are already included in the API request so no additional API calls are required.

**Some tips**

**1.Debouncing is Critical** API requests should not be sent with each individual keystroke.The system needs a 300ms delay to start the request after the user stops typing. The method reduces API requests while maintaining user experience responsiveness.

**2.Cache Common Searches** The system needs to establish fundamental in-memory caching to enhance the speed of repeated address searches.The same popular locations are searched by numerous users which enables caching to decrease API usage by 30-40%.

**3. Graceful Fallbacks** Always have a backup plan if your primary geocoding service fails. The system needs to have a backup plan to switch to another provider or at least have a smooth error handling process to keep the user experience.

**Gotchas and Limitations**

The radar system provides excellent address detection throughout the United States and Canada but its international coverage is limited.If you need global coverage, you might need a hybrid approach.

The data freshness of this platform is lower than Google because new developments take longer to appear.For most use cases this isn't an issue, but worth knowing.

The free tier allows 100K requests per month before the rate costs $0.50 for every 1K request.The free tier provides much more generous usage than Google's free tier.

Organizations can reduce costs through Google Maps alternative adoption for US-focused applications without affecting user experience. Here's our ROI.

* **Annual savings**: $52,320
* The entire project duration amounts to 4 hours.
* The system's performance remains unaffected by this change (in fact, it becomes slightly faster).
* The engineering team happiness at 100% (no more budget alerts).

It wasn‚Äôt just about money. It was about how I wanted to live, the kind of people I wanted around me, and the way I wanted to feel in a relationship.

I‚Äôm an Indian woman in my 20s, and like a lot of us, I grew up with pressure around studies, career, marriage, and being the ‚Äúperfect daughter.‚Äù But when I moved to a bigger city for work and studies, I saw a different world. A world where men with influence, money, and experience were openly dating younger women. Some called it sugar dating, and I was curious.

At first, I thought, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this just like escorting or being a call girl?‚Äù But the more I explored, the clearer it became: it‚Äôs not the same. And for me personally, the difference was big enough to shape my decision.

[be a sugar baby](https://preview.redd.it/e3ui7f1o53kf1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9ecc7cfd5a327e6c1e4c151f93b343636cb55e8)

**Why I Chose to Be a Sugar Baby**

1. **I wanted real connection, not just transactions** When I thought about being a call girl, it felt very one-time, very rushed. You meet a guy, you do what he wants, you take the money, and you leave. That didn‚Äôt sit right with me. I wanted something slower, more natural. As a sugar baby, I actually get to know my sugar daddy. We talk, we travel, we laugh, sometimes we even fight. It feels more like a relationship, even if it‚Äôs unconventional.
2. **Respect matters to me** I didn‚Äôt want to be treated like a product. I wanted to be treated like a person. Sugar daddies, at least the genuine ones, see you as their partner, not just a service. My sugar daddy values my opinions, invests in my growth, and respects my boundaries. With escorting, I feel like that line is blurred‚Äîyou‚Äôre there to please, not to be respected.
3. **Safety and choice** Let‚Äôs be real: safety is a huge factor. In escorting, you often don‚Äôt get to choose who the client is. But as a sugar baby, I can say yes or no. I pick my sugar daddy after chatting, meeting for coffee, and checking vibes. I feel safer because I have that control.
4. **Lifestyle over cash** Of course, money is part of sugar dating. But it‚Äôs not just cash in an envelope. My sugar daddy supports my studies, helps with travel, gifts me experiences I‚Äôd never afford otherwise. It‚Äôs not just about survival money‚Äîit‚Äôs about upgrading my life. That‚Äôs something escorting could never give me long-term.

**My First Experience**

I‚Äôll never forget the first time I met a sugar daddy offline. We connected online first. He was in his late 40s, a businessman, very straightforward. Instead of talking dirty or pushing me, he asked about my goals and why I was interested in sugar dating. That conversation alone made me realize I was in the right space.

When we finally met, it was at a five-star hotel lounge, not some shady room. He was respectful, charming, and surprisingly funny. He told me clearly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for a call girl. I want someone I can trust, travel with, and spoil.‚Äù That‚Äôs when it clicked‚ÄîI‚Äôm not selling myself; I‚Äôm sharing myself, with limits I set.

# Why Not a Call Girl?

* **Short-term vs. long-term**: [Call girls](https://www.sugardaddymeet.com/call-girls) may earn quickly, but it‚Äôs unstable. With sugar dating, I have ongoing support.
* **Emotional comfort**: I don‚Äôt feel empty after meeting my sugar daddy. With call work, I imagine I‚Äôd feel disconnected.
* **Social image**: In India, both are taboo, but honestly, it feels different to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with an older man who supports me,‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI sleep with men for cash.‚Äù Maybe society won‚Äôt see the difference, but *I* do, and that matters.
* **Personal growth**: My sugar daddy mentors me in business, teaches me things I‚Äôd never learn otherwise. I doubt I‚Äôd get that if I was just selling nights.

**Things I Learned Along the Way**

1. **Be clear about your boundaries** ‚Äì Sugar dating isn‚Äôt about saying yes to everything. Decide what you‚Äôre okay with.
2. **Choose carefully** ‚Äì Not every man calling himself a sugar daddy is genuine. Some just want cheap thrills.
3. **Respect yourself first** ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt, no sugar daddy will.
4. **Don‚Äôt confuse it with love** ‚Äì Sugar dating can feel like a relationship, but it‚Äôs not always forever. Enjoy it, but stay realistic.
5. **Privacy is everything** ‚Äì Be smart about what you share online and offline.

# Final Thoughts

I became a sugar baby, not a call girl, because I wanted more than money. I wanted respect, mentorship, and a lifestyle upgrade. I wanted a man who valued me as a person, not a product. And honestly, sugar dating gave me that balance.

It may not be everyone‚Äôs path, but for me, it was the right choice. Being a sugar baby allows me to grow, to enjoy life, and to do it on my terms. That‚Äôs why I say proudly: *I chose to be a sugar baby, not a call girl.*",1,1755657060.0,sugarbabydaddyindia,0,1.0,False

I am a 34 male/gender queer person. I have known the guy that I am currently dating for the past few years. We live in the same city and we followed each other on IG about 3 years ago cause we have a few mutual friends. We had never met in person and I had a thing for him but I knew that at the time he was in a relationship. I messaged him when we first followed each other saying that he was cute and that we should go for a coffee but it never materialised.

Cut to a few months ago, he started posting more pics of himself and I thought that he probably broke up with his boyfriend. I got the suss from a mutual friend of ours and to my excitement, he was single. I messaged him again to meet for a coffee but it didn't materialise again. 

3 months ago, I was cycling home and at some point I heard my name shouted at me. I looked back and it was him. I went back and we chatted for the first time. There were definitely sparks and I would define it as a meet cute. We were standing at a bridge, during the sunset and kept smiling and chatting to each other. 

We then ended up going on a date, that was amazing. Since that date we have seen each other about 6 times, all times very hot and fun. He is very busy with work and after our first date he said that he is ""famously unreliable"". He is not very responsive to my messages but I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his work.

The one thing that is kinda freaking me out though is the fact that he keeps adding me and removing me from his close friends on IG. I know that he is doing that because he has saved one of his close friends' stories in his highlights, and sometimes I can see it and sometimes I can't. He seems to be quite into the curation of his Instagram stories and the fact that he is always thinking of adding me and removing me freaks me out a bit.

I know that we are basically only starting to see each other now but we have said that we really enjoy our time with each other. He is flaky with me but when we are together, it feels great. Am I overthinking this?? Should I say something to him about it? Or is this relationship doomed?

TL;DR: is it a red flag that the guy that I started dating 3 months ago keeps adding me and removing me from his close friends on Instagram?

I went on a long trip for 2 weeks, and i have just gotten home. I had 2 flights either direction, one 3 hour flight and one 9 hour flight, so a LONG FLIGHT, I was very anxious and worked up both ways. I was traveling with my grandmother (former nurse) with her own health issues, so I had a lot of understanding and support from her as I wore my apple watch to track my heart rate, so I showed her my watch for a comparison to her hr. Obviously, mine was unreasonably high all the time (resting usually 80-110, standing immediately 135-160). One direction I thought I would be okay without wheelchair assist, but that was not the move, having to chase this dude in CIRCLES running with my grandma was not it. I had wheelchair assist on my way back, definitely needed it.

Getting into the purpose of this post, I just wanted to discuss my experience with this because I feel very crappy right now. I know that air travel and pots are not friends, and I am trying to rest and drink as much water as possible to recover. If you have any experiences to share or suggestions on how to best deal with this feel free to comment!

During the flights, other than my anxiety (and probably nicotine withdrawals tbh), I felt kind of okay during the flight, just anxious and slightly nauseous (which is one of my main symptoms) and my body hurting pretty bad. I wore compression socks and tight-ish biker shorts, I took my zofran for nausea throughout the flights, I tried to drink a lot of electrolytes before hand (probably didn‚Äôt have enough, I think I had 1 or 2 packets of 1000 mg), I kept a few puke bags with me, and I watched movies to try to keep myself calm. I had a few moments that felt like kind of hot flashes, but they kind of went away, it also may have actually been hot, not sure. I also cannot sleep in that position at all, so I was pretty tired. Either way, I was very glad to not faint or puke, and I was able to eat on the flight.

After landing there, I felt very nauseous and exhausted with a constantly racing heart for 2 whole days, even hitting 190 as I brushed my teeth (currently this is my first day home, I have been too exhausted to charge my watch, but I can feel my heart racing), my zofran was hardly helping, so I was hardly eating (I was reunited with nicotine as well, so it was not that). After 2 days we had to drive a short distance to our main location for the trip, and my nausea finally subsided. I thought maybe I was anxious to get to the main spot? But, I feel very crap today, I have had a mild to constant sensation of needing to pee but nothing come out, I went to sleep shortly after I got home, but one of my neighbors somehow burnt eggs bad enough for the fire department to come at 10 pm, so I had to get out of bed and walk down stairs and outside, which was really dope, so I did not sleep well. I woke up at 7 am unable to fall back asleep. I also deal with HEDS so all my joints and back and neck and hips are killing me today. I feel very crappy if I am sitting upright, my heart races (again not sure how much). I was a bit nauseous earlier, but I took my zofran and have been laying down for a few hours, and I feel much better that way. I feel very exhausted, but unable to sleep because my heart feels like its trying to give me a panic attack.

I have been drinking water and coffee (I have found it to regulate my hr more) and I have been laying down, but this sucks!!! Thanks for reading! Again if you have any advice or experiences to share, please share!",1,1755656580.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

1mv2i4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceNZ/comments/1mv2i4r/property_manager_wants_me_to_pay_for_sink/,Property manager wants me to pay for sink replacement,"Over a month ago I accidentally knocked a shelf in the bathroom while drying off after a shower. A candle on it fell into the ceramic sink underneath and cracked it.

I told the property manager straight away.

They came back saying ""As this is tenant damage the cost will be payable by yourselves"".

I asked if the owner had insurance and made it clear it wasn't intentional.

Since then:

* It's been over a month and the sink is still broken.
* The first quote was in 20 days ago (they got multiple), and was the one they ended up going with.
* The property owner approved a plumbers quote, but I was never told the cost, other than it was less than the insurance so it would be paid directly by invoice.
* I've been told the plumber will be in touch, and when the invoice comes I'll have to pay it (or go on a payment plan)

This feels off because:

* I never got to see or agree to the quote before they locked it in.
* My understanding is tenants are only liable for *careless* damage, capped at 4 weeks rent or the insurance excess, whichever is lower. And tenants aren't liable for genuine accidents.
* Landlords still have to keep the place in repair, and we have had no working bathroom sink for over a month. (But still knowing we have to still leave reasonable time for repair, though the original plumber mentioned the moment the quote was accepted the fixtures could be ordered and installed within the next week)
* I‚Äôve never been given any insurance info for this tenancy.

It feels like the property manager has just skipped forward and decided tenant pays no matter what.

We've been in this place for over a decade and is the first time needing to deal with this kind of thing.

It isn't about the amount either, if I even knew what it was, it sounds like the amount isn't going to be high (given the amount is less than the excess for insurance), but it feels off.

I was reading through this page here and it really does seem careless damage doesn't include going about normal life and something accidentally happens.

[https://tenant.aratohu.nz/repairs/careless-damage](https://tenant.aratohu.nz/repairs/careless-damage)

>The Tenancy Tribunal has said that these things were accidental damage, and the tenant was not liable:

>A tenant was using a blender stick when it fell out of her hands and damaged a stone benchtop. (Tenancy Tribunal Order 4272505, 4272034)¬†

>A tenant dropped a coffee cup onto a glass ceramic cooktop and cracked it. Tenancy Tribunal Order 4261406.

I could totally see if I had been throwing the candle around the room and it slipped out of my hand into the sink, but I was going about normal bathroom things, there had been a shelf there for a good amount of time, along with other things prior hanging off the same hook that we didn't place there.

Other details, we do have a tenancy agreement, it is on the older side now and we haven't had any updates to it other than allowing a dog on the property many years ago. Pretty standard tenancy otherwise. Bond was upped maybe 5 years ago.",3,1755656412.0,LegalAdviceNZ,10,0.71,False

I recently moved into a new place and the kitchen is the orignal one from 1975 and I want to do a refresh before I fully unpack the kitchen since the insides of all drawers and cabinets is in pretty poor condition cosmetically given its 50 years old and original but seems solid and is solid wood construction. Original idea was to only paint the cabinets but scope has grown now that I have started stripping down and painting.

I started with the upper cabinets by removing the doors and doing some sanding to flat out some uneven spots and transitions, caulking any gaps inside the cabinets and painting with Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee (very similar to original colour), now that I have started getting into it I am thinking that since I am removing the hardware to paint all surfaces (cabinets and doors) I can just as well fill all surfaces and holes and add new hardware (hinges and handles) to give it a more modern look but keeping the original kitchen style.

The doors are 3/8"" rebatted doors. 

I am looking for recommendations for new handles and hinges to use. What type of style would go well with this kitchen design ? Ideally soft close hinges would be preffered but seems options are none with the rebatted doors.

my husbands birthday is coming up soon and i am absolutely stumped for what to get him. 

***things he likes:*** 

* gaming (but its hopeless for me to get anything, because he has jailbroken all of his devices so he can get the games for free, and he works at a tech store so he can buy any other game really cheaply)
* tech things (but again, he works at a tech store so he can get anything for half the price)
* going to the gym (he has all of the gym clothes and shoes that anyone could ever need)
* chemistry (he is an inorganic chemist, so i doubt there is too much i could get for him there. at this point i'm seriously considering buying him a respirator for a birthday gift because the fume hood in his lab is broken)
* knives and slingshots and other things like that (we have enough of a collection of those as it is, and the last time i tried to gift him a knife it went into a drawer and never emerged)
* pokemon / dragonball z / beserk / etc. 
* our dobermann

**gifts that have been successful** 

* x box series x
* yeti esky
* a professional knife sharpening set
* meat thermometer
* electric sitting / standing desk

***things i know he doesn't want as gifts (the longest list ever)***

* clothes or shoes, because he is super picky
* alcohol, because neither of us drink
* activities (like a concert or a weekend away)
* anything nick knack-y. if its meant to sit on a shelf and look nice, he doesn't want it
* a new version of anything he currently has that is in working order. that means no belts / wallets / keychains / hats / watches / bags / etc. i foolishly bought him an apple watch when his 10 year old g-shock died last year, but he fixed it and now we have an apple watch gathering dust. 
* he doesn't care much for lego, nor swords, because those seem to be popular comments. 
* anything to do with the barbecue, because thats what my family always gets him and half of it never gets used unless they are visiting. 
* he isn't very interested in sports, so not much hope there
* anything to do with cars
* a fancy version of something where the cheap one is just as good (e.g. nice pens)
* subscriptions
* dinner vouchers or food related things
* music related things (speakers, record players, headphones, etc.)
* tools (already have everything we need and more)
* shaving / personal grooming things
* cameras / anything to do with photography
* nice coffee / coffee machine
* books, because we share a kindle and he puts whatever he wants on there for free
* jewellery (he never wears anything but his wedding band and a watch)

the worst part of all of this is that he is the best at giving gifts. every birthday, christmas and anniversary i get absolutely spoilt. i have managed to pull through and get him good gifts in the past, but this year i am really lost. 

and to avoid any comments, he is really grateful when i do get him things. he is just the pickiest minimalist in the world and always tells me he doesn't want anything. ",2,1755656002.0,Gifts,8,1.0,False

It's such a well-written episode!

Just rewatched it. I'm amazed at how well Stana portrays PTSD.  When Javi said the sniper is damaged goods, and she said ""So am I,"" it really got me.

Even when you think you're over it, and something takes you by surprise, putting you right back in your traumatic event.

Even when you don't flinch anymore.

Even when you're moving forward.

Even when you think you're finally good.

But something inside still says there's damage that won't ever heal. That you can't trust anyone. That you're not ready.

She dressed in turtleneck, gloves, and jacket - symbolizing how much you hide your pain.

How she tried to drown it in alcohol & just got hurt worse.

Refused coffee from Castle - not accepting the love that's offered.

But just how Beckett found the thing that pulled her back from the panic (thanks to Javi), it's hard to find what can pull you out of it, and when you do, it changes the panic into focus and rage.

And how Castle doesn't coddle her towards the end, stays to help figure it all out, and tells her he's not coming, that she's got this. Encouragement from loved ones, even in little things, helps so much.

Finally, she goes to counseling, trying to figure out how to move forward. It's hard. Progress is so hard. But in the end she decides she's finally ready to be more.",1,1755655505.0,CastleTV,1,1.0,False

Host asked me for my phone number in a sneaky way, wanted a private FaceTime, and is harassing me off-platform even after Airbnb told him not to. His check-in instructions tell me to lie to neighbors/doorman, making me feel unsafe. I‚Äôm traveling with two young kids, requested a full refund under Guest Safety Policy, but Airbnb keeps citing his cancellation policy. Need advice on what to do next.

Full Post:
Hi everyone ‚Äî could use some advice because I don‚Äôt know what else to do at this point.
My wife and I recently booked an Airbnb in Canada. Before confirming the reservation, the host asked her to send him her personal phone number ‚Äúone digit at a time‚Äù and said he wanted to FaceTime her privately to show her the property. She felt uncomfortable and declined, but we still booked because the listing looked nice in the photos.
As soon as we confirmed the booking, he started calling and texting her cell phone, even after I repeatedly told him I preferred to communicate only through the Airbnb app. The host happened to be in the same town that we live in last weekend and asked my wife to meet for coffee which she ignored. Airbnb support also contacted him and explicitly instructed him to use the platform only, but he continued calling and texting anyway.
On top of that, his check-in instructions include the line:
‚ÄúIf any neighbors, friends or doormen ask about owner David ‚Äì say you‚Äôre just friends visiting, he‚Äôs not home. Tell them to call David.‚Äù
That made me feel like I‚Äôm basically being asked to lie to the neighbors/doorman, which makes me think the unit is not authorized for Airbnb use. I‚Äôm traveling alone with two young children, and the whole situation now feels unsafe.
I‚Äôve contacted Airbnb multiple times (including Trust & Safety). I provided screenshots of all the calls, texts, and the check-in instructions. I clearly stated that we feel unsafe and requested a penalty-free cancellation and full refund under their Guest Safety Policy.
They still keep telling me I only qualify for a partial refund because it‚Äôs the host‚Äôs ‚Äúcancellation policy,‚Äù and that I should ‚Äúask the host directly‚Äù about the building permission. That partial refund is only $165 out of the $3,400..
At this point I feel like I‚Äôm being ignored and bounced between agents over and over.
Has anyone dealt with something like this before?
Does anyone know what else I can do to get Airbnb to actually override the host‚Äôs policy and issue a full refund?
Also ‚Äî does the check-in statement (‚Äúsay you‚Äôre just friends visiting‚Äù) count as a potential unauthorized listing?

I got sick of the ""another day another starbieeeees"" over and over again. But now my snark interest is piqued because she is a ""triathalon girlie"" now or a ""cycling girlie"".

So I am an avid cyclist (currently injured but I average 80-100 miles a week) and this sport is hella expensive and most people I know save for months if not years to get top quality bikes. And they put the miles in on those bikes.

Lurked on Annas IG and saw some posts here and saw her current bike, its more than likely a Trek Madone SLR 7, 8, or 9. The cheapest of these models is $9,500.00. But upon further sleuthing the bike she has is more than likely $13,000...and the bibshorts she has are also around $300 (like I said expensive sport) and the cyclists I know who really love it (myself included) post about their rides, coffee stops, do group rides, and generally are micromobility advocates. I dont want to gatekeep cycling but its insane how she's buying top of the line kit and bikes...and not fucking riding them. Bikes like that deserve to have the miles put underneath them...not sit in a corner and collect dust only to be used for a photo op to seem like you're serious business. Because according to her strava she rode her bike 2 whole miles ... and she wants to do an ironman...she does realise that involves a century...which is anywhere from 6-8 hours in the saddle depending on your speed....

As a seasoned cyclist who can barely afford her dream bike this pisses me off.

  
ETA: shes not racing (on IG she said she was buying her dream race bike)...she does not need a pro peloton level bike especially if she's not going to ride it. I would pay big money to see her try a crit.",14,1755655080.0,annaxsitarsnark,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 28, male, gay, based in Austin TX. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 and 180, height-weight proportional,, educated, funny, easy to talk to, and I‚Äôve been told I look good. I‚Äôm good company and pretty fun in the streets and in the sheets. I like real conversation as much as chemistry.



Until now, I saved doing anal for relationships. However, both my exes were sides, so it never happened. I‚Äôm trying to change that now, and hoping to find someone who could show me the ropes! I want my first time to feel unrushed and actually fun, with someone around my age who can guide, talk, and listen. I‚Äôd like to definitely try bottoming, and maybe even topping. I would like it to feel natural and intimate, not like a transaction.



If that‚Äôs something that interests you, I‚Äôm up for a weekend trip or a low-key staycation together, maybe a CouchSurfing situation, or a short getaway? For example, days could be for the city and some favorite spots: markets, coffee, bookstores, museums, science centers, architecture walks, drives just to feel the place, and trying out the local cuisine. At night, we work on popping my cherry, and subsequent practice sessions.



Health and safety are important to me. I‚Äôm DDF and negative. Condoms are preferred and I ask that you are DDF and negative too. I value personal hygiene a lot. I‚Äôm fine with a quick status chat and a short call before we plan.



Bedroom vibe: I tend to be more sub at first. I care deeply that it‚Äôs fun for both of us. I love making out, body contact, nipple play, mutual edging, frotting, oral, 69, dry humping and grinding. I enjoy worshipping fit bodies. I‚Äôm kink friendly within reason. One playful idea I always had is a sex-position roulette where we open an online list, hit ‚Äúrandom‚Äù, and switch! I‚Äôm open to other ideas too. Always enjoy longer, passionate sessions.



Who I‚Äôm open to: Men, and maybe couples (MM or MF, although my engagement with the F will be limited), as long as the vibe is respectful and everyone communicates like an adult. Age-similar¬† and similar in other stats would be ideal. If you‚Äôre steady, curious, and do not flake, we‚Äôll get along really well, and have a fun weekend!



If this sounds like something you‚Äôd be down for, DM me with a good message, and somehow work in the word ‚Äúpineapples‚Äù into it (IYKYK ;)). I‚Äôm happy to do a quick call so we both feel comfortable before we lock anything in.

Casually parked at Rockaway Beach drinking coffee in my car when an older man in active clothing walked past on the sidewalk, between the grassy area and in front of where cars park.

As I took a sip of my coffee while still in my car, he stopped in front of my car, looked at me and made an extremely lewd and uncomfortable gesture that rhymes with ‚Äúbellatio‚Äù. Then continued walking on his way.

A woman in the car next to me was also looked at by him as he did the gesture. We rolled down our windows and commiserated together about how extremely uncomfortable and disgusted that made us feel.

In retrospect, wish I acted faster, got out of my vehicle, snapped a photo to report the man for sexual harassment, and cussed him out. We were absolutely jaw-dropped shocked. But he was gone by the time I had snapped out of being frozen from disbelief.

His comfortable demeanor when making this gesture suggests this is not the first time he‚Äôs done this. Please stay vigilant or bring some protection at this beach or while on the trail.

Think of it as your personal project sidekick‚Äîtweak it to fit your style, and you're good to go!

Basically, this Base has three rockstar types of properties:

1. üü• Red ""**Data Sources**"": These pull straight from your note properties, like status or progress (we'll dive into that soon).
2. üü© Green ""**Display Data**"": This jazzes things up for easy reading, turning numbers into emojis, progress bars, or snazzy countdown text.
3. üü¶ Blue ""**Sorting Data**"": Converts info into **numbers** for slick sorting‚Äîperfect for when you need to prioritize like a boss.

# Core Properties

Here's the lowdown on a basic project properties set:

    ---  
    status: In Progress  
    passion: 5  
    deadline: 2025-08-19T12:51:00  
    progress: 60  
    ---

* `status` (text) is your project's mood ring, showing its current vibe. **Sortable**.
   * Default options: `To Do, In Progress, Focus, On Hold, Cancelled, Completed`.
   * *Psst: Swap these to your own terms‚Äîjust do a bulk replace in the base file!*
* `passion` (number 1-5) measures your hype level (or priority). Think of it as your ""how much coffee do I need?"" scale.
* `progress` (number 0-100) is your completion meter‚Äîit auto-magically turns into a progress bar.
* `deadline` (date) is the due date countdown, complete with flashy icons. Sortable.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Only notes with a `status` get the ""project"" badge‚Äîeverything else is optional gravy.



# Why This Rocks

This template is packed with clever tricks to make your Base life easier:

* Use `if()` to transform data based on values‚Äîlike turning a number into a celebratory emoji when progress hits 100%.
* Convert text to numbers for **custom sorting** (e.g., make ‚ÄúHigh Priority‚Äù > ‚ÄúMedium Priority‚Äù > ‚ÄúLow Priority‚Äù).
* Dynamically whip dates into **readable text**, like ""Due in 3 days!"" with matching icons.

Hope this gives your Base a fun boost of inspiration!



# Pro Tips

**Embed Images**

Grab the first embedded file in a note with file.embeds\[0\]‚Äîuse it in a formula to create cover images for Card View. Voil√†, instant project gallery!



**Embed Custom Views**

Link directly to views like `![[base-Projects-Template.base#Ongoing]]` to show only active projects. All views can be shared this way.

  
**Work with plugins**

This base works nice with plugins like **TaskNotes** since the properties can all be shared.

Here is Part 4.

\---------------------------------------------

The Saturday of my sixth day here, broke gray and thin, like the sun itself was reluctant to climb over the mountains. The pale light slanted through the window, catching the circle of salt still clinging to the floorboards around my chair. I hadn‚Äôt moved all night. My knees ached from being bent too long, my back stiff as timber, neck knotted from the rifle resting across my lap. Every joint popped when I finally stood, a groan tearing out of me before I could stop it.

I brushed the salt aside with the edge of my boot, ashamed of how much comfort the circle had given me, and shuffled toward the stove. The tin kettle sat waiting. Coffee grounds, already measured out last week, clattered into the pot with a sound that was far too loud in the silence. My hands shook while I struck the match.

The flame flared to life, and for a moment the tower smelled not of damp wood, salt, and ash, but of something almost domestic‚Äîscorched metal, boiling water, bitter coffee rising warm and sharp. My uncle‚Äôs old tin mug sat chipped at the rim, dented on one side, but it felt solid in my hand as I poured. I add my customary spoonful of sugar and stirred, just letting the scent of it calm me.

I stood at the window, sipping the first mouthful, tongue burning, the taste anchoring me more than the caffeine ever could. The soreness in my muscles reminded me I was still here, still breathing. Still mine.

But outside, the woods pressed in like they hadn‚Äôt gone anywhere at all.

The first sound I heard that morning wasn‚Äôt the forest. It was the deep, rhythmic chop of rotors.

Relief punched through me sharp as a knife. Saturday. *Resupply day.* For a moment, the sound of the helicopter was almost holy‚Äîa noise too heavy, too mechanical, too human to belong to these woods. The comfort of man's ever-advancing technology triumphing over the air and sky.

I stumbled outside into the balcony, blinking hard against the pale morning light, my eyes raw from too many hours without sleep. Then, I rushed to the door. The metal steps groaned beneath me as I descended, and I caught myself muttering the rule under my breath‚Äîcounting each step, don‚Äôt look back, don‚Äôt break rhythm. Forty-five in total and three landings. Normal again. This morning, I whispered the numbers like a prayer, each one pressed between my teeth, afraid that if I faltered the forest might notice and reach for me mid-step.

When my boots hit the packed earth, I let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding. The treeline stood where it always did, looming, patient, still as a mural. But today it did not lean closer, did not whisper, did not claw at the edges of my sight. It *waited.*

Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought as the wind whipped grit into my eyes and clothes: the forest wasn‚Äôt retreating. It was biding its time, letting the noise pass, patient as stone. The treeline loomed still and watchful, but it held back, as though the thrum of the UH-60‚Äôs blades had carved a barrier the forest dared not cross.

Above, the Black Hawk swung low over the ridge, a dark shape cutting across the sky, its downdraft whipping the trees into a frenzy. The sound rolled over the trees like a shield, pressing them back, as if the machine‚Äôs violence carved a clean wound through the forest‚Äôs hunger. For the first time in days, the watchtower didn‚Äôt feel like an island sinking into dark waters‚Äîit felt like it might still be tethered to the world beyond.

Pine needles scattered like green rain, stinging my face as I shielded my eyes. The pilot brought it steady over the clearing, lowering the sling load.

Now that it was closer, I saw that the Black Hawk had the same dark green paint scheme as the ones I observed the day before. I half expected that it would have the same eye-in-the-diamond-with-the-crossed-arrows-behind emblazoned on its side, but I guess that would be too... conspicuous? In as much as a dark-colored helicopter ever was.

As for the heavy pallet that descended towards me, chained and tarped, it actually wasn't that big. A rectangular iron lockbox about 2 ft. wide and 3 ft. long in size. It was only supposed to contain about 7 to 8 days worth of supplies, after all.

As soon as the box touched the ground, I was on it in an instant. I knew that these sort of drops needed to be executed in as quick and efficient a manner as possible. Almost immediately, I could see that the ironbox could not be detached from the chains. I guess, I'll have to open it and repack its contents in my backpack.

I opened it and did a quick inventory of the stuff inside; canned goods, a couple pounds of frozen meats, some fresh produce, a bag of coffee with creamers and sachets of sugar, an entire sack of salt, and a small box of iron nails. Next to the nails, the government folks were even kind enough to include a small box of 45-70 ammunition for my rifle.

*Nice.*

But as I began to shove the items into my pack, I heard them. *Inhuman shrieks*. Coming from the treeline.

I looked up, three... *creatures*... had emerged from the shadows of the trees in the early morning light. I realized then that it was still 7am, three full hours from the safe period of patrol. My blood turned to ice water as my eyes widened in horror.

The things weren‚Äôt men, weren‚Äôt animals. They were *wrong*. The first thing I noticed was the way they moved‚Äîtoo fast, too deliberate, but broken. Like film missing frames, stuttering forward in lunges and jerks that made my eyes ache to follow.

The creatures were man-shaped only in the loosest sense, stretched and distorted into something that looked like flesh forced over broken scaffolding. Their limbs dangled too long, bending at joints that didn‚Äôt exist, and their heads lolled unnaturally, antlers jutting like spires of bone. Their eyes glowed like cinders in the half-light, fixed and pitiless, and when their mouths tore open too wide, splitting back toward their ears, the shrieks that poured out carried a vibration so sharp it felt like the air itself was breaking.

Above, the helicopter bucked in the air. The pilot had seen them‚Äîhe had to have. A moment later, the side doors rattled open. A crewman in full kit leaned out, bracing a weapon that looked more cannon than rifle. Almost immediately, the distinct *thud-thud-thud* of heavy caliber gunfire was interspersed with the helicopters rotor wash.

*‚ÄúFFFFFFF‚Äî!‚Äù* I scrambled, clutching the box of ammo and shoving the last of the salt into my pack. The nearest of the creatures went down, writhing on the ground in agony from what looked like multiple incendiary rounds burning their way through its body. But the second creature vaulted over its thrashing body with impossible grace, legs folding like a spider‚Äôs as it launched forward, claws slicing through the ground like plow blades.

I snapped the lever on my rifle, jamming a fat .45-70 round into the chamber. The butt slammed into my shoulder as I brought the sights up, trying to steady my hands. The first shot cracked through the clearing, drowning for a split-second in rotor thunder. The recoil was a comforting shock to my system, focusing my senses against the oncoming horrors coming at me.

The iron-core round hit the onrushing thing dead-center, slamming into its chest like a sledgehammer swung by God Himself. This time, there was no stagger, no hollow trick. The bullet punched clean through and blossomed in a spray of shredded bone and black ichor. The force ripped its chest wide open, the tarry tendrils inside spasming and then collapsing like a nest of worms scalded by flame. The creature toppled with a howl that broke into static, its body twitching violently in the ground.

I racked another round, chambering with a clack that felt like salvation. The third was circling, its claws scraping grooves into the packed dirt as it howled in unison with the forest itself. The trees rippled in the distance, shadows thrumming like a heartbeat, as if dozens more pressed against the threshold, waiting.

The Black Hawk crewman raked the treeline with fire, the heavy gun chewing through pine and branch. The shrieks multiplied from beyond the treeline, dozens of unseen voices answering the gunner‚Äôs fury. The air tasted like metal and smoke.

But I was no longer frozen. My sights found the next target. My rifle bucked again, iron and fire roaring into the morning.

And for once‚Äî*for once*‚ÄîI felt like maybe these woods weren‚Äôt untouchable.

The smoke from the gunner‚Äôs bursts hadn‚Äôt even cleared before two more figures tore themselves from the treeline. Their antlers caught the pale morning light, jagged and branching like dead trees ripped from the ground. Both moved differently than the first‚Äîlower to the earth, skittering on all fours before rising to sprint on legs bent wrong. Their shrieks harmonized into a hideous chorus, and my skin prickled as the sound dug like needles into my skull.

‚ÄúCome on then,‚Äù I hissed through my gritted teeth, cycling the lever. The brass spat from the rifle‚Äôs side as kept my sights trained on the shadows.

Of course, I knew that I wasn't really ""killing"" these things. *Iron doesn't kill them, but it does hurt them.* My uncle's warning echoed in my mind as I continued blasting. Even now, as I took a quick glance around, I saw the creatures that I had downed were still writhing, slowly but surely attempting to crawl back to the shadows of the treeline. Curiously though, the ones that the chopper gunner had nailed had stopped moving and were beginning to dissolve in smoking masses of ooze.

I let them be as more pressing matters presented themselves, the first of a new pair lunged, claws carving the earth, its burning eyes locked on me. I squeezed the trigger again.

The big 45-70 Gov't round roared out of the barrel. The iron-core bullet hit it high in the sternum, the crack of impact carrying even through the helicopter‚Äôs thunder. The round exploded out its back in a geyser of shredded matter. Black ichor sprayed across the clearing, sizzling where it touched the dirt. The creature staggered, spasmed violently, and then collapsed mid-charge, its limbs twisting inward like a spider curling in death.

The second creature screeched, but it didn‚Äôt attack. Its head lolled unnaturally as it paced at the edge of the clearing, claws flexing. Then, with a jerking motion, it tilted its face skyward at the circling Black Hawk. Its glowing eyes seemed to *narrow*. For an instant, I thought it might try to leap at the hovering machine.

Instead, it shrieked one last time and skittered backward into the treeline. Its retreat was not flight but something far more controlled‚Äîdeliberate, as though it had judged me, measured me, and decided the game was not over. Just‚Ä¶ delayed.

I stood there panting, my rifle still shouldered, the barrel smoking in the morning air. My ears rang from the shots, and my body thrummed with the sharp aftershock of recoil and adrenaline.

Above, the Black Hawk continued to hover, rotors chopping the air, the box still firmly on the ground like the anchor of a ship. The pilot must have had remarkable control of his craft. I glanced up to see the gunner‚Äôs weapon scanning the trees. The hovering presence pressed the forest back like a hand on a wound, but already the treeline rippled with shadow again, a patient reminder that the reprieve was temporary.

I quickly went back to the box and finished shoving every last bit of the supplies into my overburdened pack. Then, I closed the lockbox with an audible clang and stepped back, looking up once again. The helicopter couldn‚Äôt stay. I knew it. They all knew it.

*They probably went through this routine every week.* Or so I thought at the time... I didn't find out until about a year later that this sort of attack only happened twice before in the last decade. So, I must've really pissed these things off something fierce the past few days. Which, considering what they did to my mental state on a daily basis at the time, I chalked up to a *win*.

With a final sweep, the gunner slammed the weapon back into the craft, then gave a brief nod down at me‚Äîacknowledgment, maybe even respect‚Äîbefore sliding the door shut.

The chopper tilted, lifted, and within moments it was a dark speck tearing away across the ridgeline, its sound fading into the vast weight of silence.

And just like that, I was alone again. Alone with the supplies, the salt, the rifle heavy in my hands‚Ä¶ and the forest, still watching, still waiting.

I double-timed it back to the watch tower, adrenaline making the heavy bag on my back little more than an inconvenience. I climbed the stairway quickly, counting out loud the entire time. 45 steps, three landings. All good. I still touched the silver coin the door before I opened it.

I quickly scanned the interior with growing familiarity. I've been here now for a few days, so I was starting to get a feel of which things belonged and what didn't, though I still had to check the list a couple times. Finding nothing amiss, I finally allowed myself to relax and deposit the pack in its customary chair by the table as the adrenaline finally began to bleed off me.

By the time I‚Äôd stowed the supplies, the first crash of fatigue hit me. My legs shook as though the adrenaline had burned straight through the muscle, leaving nothing but trembling cords. I forced myself to sit, only for a moment, breathing against the copper tang of gunpowder still clinging to my hands.

But routine wouldn‚Äôt wait. Routine was survival. I washed up a bit, made myself a ham and cheese sandwich to pair with my sweetened black coffee, and got back to readying myself for the rest of the day.

A little time later, I checked my watch. 10:00. Patrol time. The forest wouldn‚Äôt forgive me for being late, not after what had just happened.

I checked over and slung the rifle, and packed up my pouch of salt, which I had refilled from the new supplies. I gave everything one more once over and then locked the door behind me. Each step down the tower was methodical this time, still counting the numbers out loud but, softer this time, like the counting itself might keep the forest from noticing me. Forty-five. Three landings. Every motion a ward.

When I reached the bottom, I took a deep breath, knowing full-well now what type of creatures dwelt in the forest I was about to walk into. But as a British friend of mine said once, *""You just gotta crack on.""*

The clearing looked unchanged, but the air felt heavier now, thick as damp cloth against my skin. Of the revolting bodies and oozing blood splatters that were left during the battle, there were no signs. Everything looked pristine, as if nothing utterly horrific happened here three hours ago.

*Kind of them to do the clean up.* I chuckled darkly. Though, I self-reasoned that these things probably completely dissolve under the direct sunlight, like vampires in myth. Which was probably why my patrol hours were from 10am to 2pm, when the sun was at its apex in the sky... Maybe.

It didn't explain why these things could still move around in the day. *I mean,* t*hey can't die because the forest will simply revive them or some shit, but... maybe... they were weaker in the day?* I tabled the thought for later.

The treeline loomed closer than before, branches knit tighter together, like ribs closing around a heart. The silence pressed against me, so absolute that even the crunch of my boots on dirt sounded like an intrusion.

I set out on the patrol path, rifle up, eyes sweeping. The forest was quiet, unnaturally so. Even the wind seemed to have gone still, pine boughs hanging limp as if the trees themselves were holding their breath.

The first totem stood where it should, salt circle unbroken, coins gleaming faintly in the weak light. I crouched low, running my hand near the dirt. The salt hadn‚Äôt been disturbed, but the ground around it‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt right. The soil looked churned, as though something had dragged claws through it during the night, careful not to break the circle but close enough to remind me they‚Äôd been here. Watching. Testing.

I straightened slowly, and that‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äîfaint, high-pitched, almost delicate. A chittering sound, like teeth clacking together in the distance. The sound crawled under my skin, coming from just ahead on the trail.

I forced myself forward, muscles coiled tight. Each step crunched louder than it should have, echoing too far, as though the trees were amplifying the sound to announce me.

The chittering faded as I pressed on, though the echo of it lingered in my bones. My eyes swept the treeline, expecting movement, a glimpse of red eyes, antlered silhouettes‚Äîbut the woods remained still, stubbornly unreadable.

The second totem came into view just where it should, its crooked wooden frame leaning slightly but holding firm. The salt ring was intact, the coin resting undisturbed at its base. Relief seeped into me, thin and fleeting. I crouched, brushing away a drift of pine needles and checking the perimeter with deliberate care. Nothing broken. Nothing shifted.

But when I leaned closer, I noticed the faintest smudge just outside the circle‚Äîa line of pressed earth, as though something heavy had knelt there in the dark, inches from crossing the threshold. My scalp prickled, and I found myself gripping the rifle tighter, eyes darting to the treeline again.

The silence held. I forced myself to breathe, dropped a pinch of fresh salt to strengthen the ring, and straightened with a grunt. ‚ÄúTwo down,‚Äù I whispered, like the sound of my own voice could tether me to something human.

The path bent deeper into the woods, pine needles and damp earth muffling my steps. I counted them in my head, not the way I did the tower stairs, but just to keep the silence at bay. Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty‚Äî

The third totem revealed itself ahead, rising from the underbrush like a skeletal sentinel. Its ring of salt was still clean, a white halo against the dark soil, and the coins gleamed sharp as new pennies. Perfect. Untouched.

I crouched to inspect it, brushing debris away, running my hand along the ground for disturbances. Unlike the first two, this site felt calmer somehow. The air was lighter, not by much, but enough that I could draw a deeper breath without the forest pressing in on me.

Still, my gaze lingered on the treeline, waiting for the faintest twitch of shadow. Nothing. Only branches swaying ever so slightly, though I could have sworn I felt no breeze.

I adjusted the sling on my rifle and rose, rolling the stiffness out of my shoulders. ‚ÄúThree‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThree‚Äôs always fine.‚Äù

But even as I said it, the memory of that chittering scraped at the back of my skull. It hadn‚Äôt been the wind. And whatever had made it‚Ä¶ it hadn‚Äôt gone far.

The trail bent sharply downhill and usually took me a few minutes to navigate. The trees gave way to a small clearing where the fourth and newest totem stood. Its wood was still pale and raw, lashed together with fresh cord, the salt ring bright and clean in the morning light. I slowed my pace, scanning automatically, expecting the usual silence.

Instead, movement caught my eye.

Two men were crouched near the base of the totem. They wore dark tactical gear, polymer rifles slung against their chests, along with helmets with mirrored visors. For a split second, my heart leapt. *People. Actual people.* Relief punched through me so hard I nearly laughed. I hadn‚Äôt realized how starved I was for another human presence until now.

They moved like operators I‚Äôd crossed paths with during my two tours overseas‚Äîprofessional, squared away, every motion sharp and economical. For a moment, the sight of them tugged at something familiar, almost comforting--a couple memories from my deployments briefly surfaced. The coil of tension in my shoulders loosened, and I found myself stepping forward, lowering my rifle just a fraction.

One of them straightened, turning toward me. His visor reflected my pale, drawn face back at me like a warped mirror.

‚ÄúRanger,‚Äù he said evenly, voice clipped, military, and slightly muffled by the black balaclava that covered his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just in time. This totem wasn‚Äôt constructed properly. Command wants it reconfigured.‚Äù

The words rolled out crisp and regular, but almost *too* regular‚Äîno cadence, no inflection, like he‚Äôd rehearsed them from a recording. His posture was textbook, back straight, rifle at his chest, but he didn‚Äôt *shift*. Not a twitch, not a breath fogging the visor. He was still as a statue, only his head tilted fractionally toward me.

The other figure still crouched by the salt line, one gloved hand hovering a fraction above the ring. He traced its curve slowly, deliberately, as if measuring it in the air. His hand stopped just short of touching, trembling ever so slightly‚Äînot from fatigue, but anticipation. Like a predator hovering before a strike.

‚ÄúNot constructed properly?‚Äù I echoed, and the sudden relief that had flooded my chest drained out in a cold wash. My eyes darted to the salt, then back to the soldier. The ring was perfect‚Äîclean, tight, unbroken. If anything, it was stronger than the older ones. I knew what a damaged line looked like, and this wasn‚Äôt it.

The standing man gave the smallest of nods, mechanical. ‚ÄúDefects. The some of the patterns here,"" he gestured to the totem, ""are out of alignment. You‚Äôll need to sweep it clear so we can realign the protective circle.‚Äù

I froze. The words clanged in my skull, metallic and wrong. *Sweep it clear.*

The two must have sense my sudden tension, because the first one moved a step forward and said in a friendlier tone, ""We can't touch the artifacts ourselves, we're not cleared for that. You're the VIP here, you have to do it.""

Possible, even probable. But something about the way they were talking‚Äîthe calm precision, the lack of hesitation, as if the sentences themselves had been pulled from a script‚Äîset every nerve in my body humming. My uncle‚Äôs words surged back like bile: **They will test you.**

I studied his visor again. My reflection stared back at me, distorted and pale. But behind the dark shield, there was no movement. No glimmer of an eye. No trace of breath fogging the glass in the chill. Just blackness, solid and endless.

‚ÄúAnd after I wipe the salt ring, how are you guys going to transport this thing out?‚Äù I asked, forcing my voice to sound doubtful of the *procedure* rather than of them. My rifle stayed low, but my fingers itched to pull the trigger, a habit I couldn‚Äôt quite smother.

The standing figure didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, the one crouched by the totem tilted his helmet slightly toward me. ‚ÄúWe got transport hovering nearby,‚Äù he said. His tone was clipped, professional‚Äîalmost convincing‚Äîbut there was a pause between each word, like someone stringing sounds together from memory rather than speaking them.

And true enough, if I strained my ears, I could just barely catch it: the faint, distant thump of rotor blades. *Strange. I hadn‚Äôt heard a damn thing until just now.* My stomach tightened. Either I was losing it, or the sound was just not there until a moment ago.

All semblance of my relief had curdled into something sharp and cold.

‚ÄúOrders are orders,‚Äù the first soldier pressed. His words fell flat, too flat. The sound wasn‚Äôt shaped in a throat‚Äîit was hollow, as if the air itself had been *pushed* into the mold of speech. It scraped wrong in my ears, and a shiver ran down my spine despite the stillness of the clearing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll comply.‚Äù

The second soldier finally raised his head from the salt line. For an instant, his visor caught the light, and I wished it hadn‚Äôt. Behind that mirrored surface, there was no hint of an eye. Instead, something slick and restless writhed‚Äîlike oil floating on water, colors sliding and twisting across each other in shapes that weren‚Äôt natural. The shimmer pulsed faintly, as though aware of my stare.

It wasn‚Äôt a man staring at me from behind that visor. It was something else‚Äîsomething *wearing* the outline of a soldier, something that had learned the shape but not the soul. It watched, measured, weighed me like a butcher sizing up meat.

*First the girl, and now these two.* My chest seized with raw terror, but underneath the panic, a flicker of heat sparked in my gut‚Äîsimmering anger. *Enough of this.* Enough of being tested, toyed with. I shifted my weight back, hand tight around the rifle‚Äôs grip. I hadn‚Äôt raised it yet, but every nerve screamed for me to. The trees loomed silent and swollen around us, the whole forest waiting for the slip. They had me outnumbered and outgunned... at least if the guns were even real.

Couldn't take the chance, so I needed a plan, some way to distract them. I paused, the beginnings of something utterly stupid flared in my mind. Something only a bunch of dumb army E-4s would think of. *Whatever. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, I'm dead anyway.*

I let my shoulders sag, gave them a nod like I‚Äôd finally caved. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I muttered, voice low, resigned. ‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù

I took a couple steps forward, then gave the impression of looking behind them and slightly upward. ""Hey,"" I said, a brow raised and a pouring in a lot of fusion into my tone. ""Did you guys bring in a second helicopter for this? Because it's coming in too fast.""

The effect was instant. Both things froze, then, in the same breathless second, with almost inhuman speed, they both turned to look behind them to search the sky for the incoming helicopter.

I didn't waste a second. My rifle came up in a single smooth motion, sight on the first imposter‚Äôs faceplate, and I squeezed. The round punched through with a wet crack, shattering the fa√ßade. What dropped wasn‚Äôt a man‚Äîit convulsed, body unraveling into something thinner, boneless, sloughing into a shriek as its false skin collapsed inward.

The second roared. Not a human sound, not even close‚Äîmore like claws raking against iron inside a furnace. It lunged, faster than I‚Äôd expected, its rifle vanishing into smoke as its hands tore into long, blackened talons.

I barely swung my weapon around in time, parrying the first swipe with the stock. The impact rattled my bones, nearly tearing the rifle from my grip. The thing also recoiled a bit, as if touching the black iron of the barrel had hurt it. But the moment passed and it came in high to slashed at me again.

I drove my boot into its knee, felt the joint crunch--which surprised me--then I shoved the rifle‚Äôs muzzle up under its chin. Point-blank, I pulled the trigger. Once. Twice. Cycling the lever each time. The rounds blew open the visor, tearing through the mass of unidentifiable meat beneath. Its body spasmed, twisting in ways no spine should, then collapsed into a puddle of tar that hissed against the salt ring.

For a few heartbeats, the only sound was my ragged breathing, the echo of the gunshots rolling away into the treeline. The forest swallowed the noise greedily, returning to that suffocating silence. I noted that the sound of the distant chopper had also ceased.

*Holy shit, I can't believe that worked!*

I swallowed hard, throat raw, forcing myself to look down at the mess bleeding into the dirt. The tar hissed and bubbled where it brushed the salt, eating at the earth but never crossing the line. Curiously, much like those hit by the chopper crewman back at the watch tower clearing, these things had dissolved into oozes instead of retaining their shape and attempting to crawl back into the shadows.

I glanced up, checking the position of the sun. It was 'high noon', as the old gunslingers would say... *Huh, maybe there was some merit in my earlier thought of them being weaker during patrol hours.* I looked back at the totem.

Whatever they‚Äôd been, the circle had still held. The totem still stood.

They hadn‚Äôt wanted to break it themselves. They‚Äôd wanted me to do it for them.

That thought twisted my gut more than the fight itself. My uncle‚Äôs warning echoed sharp in my skull: *They will test you.* It was one of the first things he wrote in his letter, his first warning.

I crouched low, scanning the salt ring. Not a grain out of place. Strong, unbroken. The silver coin glinted brightly under the sun. The totem itself was steady, the carved wood still bristling with its strange symbols, cords tight and clean. It was better built than the others, just as I‚Äôd first thought.

For a second, I pressed my palm against the dirt, steadying myself. My legs still trembled from the fight, adrenaline buzzing hot in my blood. I realized I was shaking‚Äînot from fear anymore, but from the lingering *anger* clawing through me. They‚Äôd used the image of soldiers. Familiar. Trusted. They knew what would disarm me this time. But like everything they did, it was half-assed, they couldn't pull off the full picture. But it was clear that they were learning, when 'innocence' failed, they learned to use 'duty' against me, and I had to be better prepared in the future.

I finished my patrol of the fifth totem, all clear there too, no disturbances, and got back to the tower before the clock struck 2pm.

The climb felt longer than usual as I counted out the steps. My legs were still rubber from the fight, my lungs raw, but I forced myself up without pause. Forty-five steps, three landings. It was almost like a mantra now. By the time I reached the door at the top, sweat slicked my back despite the cool afternoon breeze. I paused there, hand on the latch, listening. Nothing stirred inside. No creak of wood. No misplaced breath.

I pushed in. The cabin smelled of coffee gone stale, paper, and that faint tang of salt and iron I‚Äôd started to associate with safety. I closed the door behind me and locked it, throwing the bolt with deliberate finality. Only then did I allow myself to sag into the chair by the desk, just taking a few minutes to myself as I half-heartedly looked around for ""extra"" objects the forest may have put into my home. But, there were none. Looks like they didn't want to risk me blowing it off the balcony again for a while.

After about half-an-hour just sitting there, I finally got up to do some cleaning on the rifle. The old weapon had saved my bacon today more than once, and I was gonna give it the attention it deserved.

And I spent an hour like, that just methodically cleaning the gun, checking its parts, and reloading it with a full nine rounds of 45-70s. When I was done, it was 4:40pm and I decided to make myself an early dinner. I cooked myself a fat juicy steak and paired with peas and rice, and a powdered lemonade mix. Weird, I know, but the sugar and acidity felt good on the tongue.

Finally, I made my report on the sat phone. My voice sounded strange to my own ears‚Äîthin, gravelly, worn down to the cord. I laid out the facts as clearly as I could, thinking that my ‚Äúhandlers,‚Äù or whatever shadow office they answered to, would be damn interested to know these things could mimic their own spec ops units... If they didn‚Äôt know already.

Their reply was the same as always. Flat. Mechanical. *‚ÄúAcknowledged. Continue watch.‚Äù*

That was it. No questions. No surprise. No concern. Just the same dead phrase. As if there was ever a choice for me. Continue watch. Like I could clock out, walk away, leave all this behind. When the line clicked dead, I let the phone rest heavy in my hand for a moment before sliding it back into my pack with more force than necessary.

I stepped out onto the balcony. The thick metal grating creaked under my boots, and the cold air bit into my lungs. Crisp, sharp, almost clean compared to the rot of what I‚Äôd faced earlier. I tried to let it steady me, let it wash the fog of anger and fear out of my head. My eyes wandered the tree line, tracing the black sea of pine and oak until the horizon blurred.

*God, I was tired.* Not the simple tired of a long hike or a missed night‚Äôs sleep, but the deep, bone-heavy weariness that made my eyelids drag and my muscles throb like they‚Äôd been beaten with iron rods. My body screamed for rest, but my mind kept circling, replaying the fight, replaying the way those things had *looked at me.*

I forced myself into a couple of slow circles around the tower, the rifle slung at my shoulder, more out of ritual than vigilance. I chuckled a little to myself that, at least from the outside, I looked more like a prison guard on a watch tower looking over the inmates. But, the sobering thought came on its heels that this was probably more true than not.

As I circled, each lap felt slower than the last, my boots scuffing against the boards as if gravity had doubled. When I finally gave up and went back inside, the act of bolting the door felt like sealing a coffin lid.

Again, I checked for foreign objects, again I came up empty. I scattered salt across the windowsills and the base of the doorframe, dragging the last of my strength into the motions. A final sprinkle around my bed for good measure. The rifle went beside me, freshly cleaned, freshly loaded, resting within easy reach. That little ritual gave me just enough comfort to let go.

I collapsed onto the cot, my body folding into it as if I were sinking into water. The mattress was thick but frayed, the blanket scratchy. It didn‚Äôt matter. My bones ached for stillness. My head barely touched the pillow before I slipped under, dragged down into sleep faster than I had in days.

Cool coffee/bobo/matcha place(s), restaurants/cafes that might appeal to that age, and book/music stores are my first guess. She's also very into k pop. I don't know how much of a k pop love there is - didn't see much online, but I'm out of touch with this area now so I'm out of the loop. 

If anyone is willing to share what they like up in Bellingham, or where their college kids like to hang out, I would love to hear it!

If it's relevant, my partner and his daughter have lived in Everett/Mill Creek/Bothell (technically their address is unincorporated Snohomish county) for a decade, so that's where they're coming from.

1mv1rjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1mv1rjn/the_professor_4/,The Professor 4,"The professor spent half the day in the commoner section of the city. He wants to restaurants and bars. Usually ordered one drink or meal and listened to conversations around him. The majority of commoners attitude seem very positive towards the Staples. A few people envied them but I was normal for family which just found themselves with one of their members becoming a noble.. 

Eventually he started the long walk to this Staples house.. he was hoping to catch most of the family at home on this Saturday afternoon. Evil literally look like a professor. He was wearing a nice commoner suit. In his suitcase by hs side lay much information on the Nobles and their behavior. pattern.

He walked by a house just before the Staples. An old man stopped on the porch with an easel in front of them painting his days away. 

Being polite he waved. The old man gave him a half wave then went back to painting but his eyes never left him.

He took a breath, knock on the door and waited. I'm mad answer the door. His sleeves rolled up and many healed scars from tinkering. 

""How can we help you?"" Mr Staples asked. The professor put out of his hand for a handshake. ""Most people call me the professor. Wyatt sent me to help your family. Can we discuss this inside?""

Wyatt shook his hand and invited him to enter their house. They headed to the kitchen. Mr Staples called in the rest of Wyatt's family. 

Aaa spoke first. ""Okay professor two questions first of all do you have proof that why it sent you and second what is your real name.""

The professor was about to answer when another knock on the door could be hurt. 

""I'll get it"" said Wam. He came back looking very confused with Mr Warlow by his side. Mr Warlow needs a cup of sugar"" Wam explained. And all the years they had been neighbors not once had Mr Warlow asked for a cup of anything because he was out. 

Wam showed Mr Warlow to his seat and lean back on the counter. 

Winona asked the professor ""Can you answer my husband's questions please""

""My name is  Francois LeRoi. If you happen to know old friends from her home planet do not get confused. LeRoi is French for the king but trust me I am a commoner. All my life has been spent teaching nobleman and commoners but majority of my time is spent teaching the Nobles children now. 


He handed a business card to Mr Staples. Mr Warlow not missing a Beat ask for one. ""Just in case those Nobles wish to learn how to paint. I would not mind a bit of extra credits. May I get a business card also?.

The professor happily handed him a business card smiling. ""I have a video here from your son. Do you mind if your neighbor sees it or would you prefer a private viewing?""


Mr Warlow he is a great friend and neighbor. We do not mind if he views it also.""

The professor reached into his bag and pulled out his tablet. He's set it up and together they viewed the video a few times. 

Winona brought out a cup of sugar for Mr Warlow. Mr Warlow said thank you and ask when to walk him home with his cup of sugar. 

They had coffee and weeded for Wam to return. A short time later he did. His father spoke up ""your name is two hard for me to say so do you mind if we call you professor?"" The man gave a great big smile and nodded approvingly. 

""How do you intend to help us professor?"" Winona asked. 

""I would be advising you of all the pitfalls and the games the Nobles play. I will be staying in the town for an extended amount of time and will be available at any time to answer questions. 

I have been studying all the houses on this planet and if you give me a small space to set it up I I can put up Church with their family trees and also on typical behavior of these Nobles. 

""How much will this cost us Mr Staples asked.

The professor showed a great big smile and said an artist paid for my services already so there is no cost to Baron Staples or yourself. Actually it is a royal Marine an old friend which covered it. Since we met many years ago he nicknamed me professor and I nicknamed him the artist."" 

The two boys suddenly had many questions like how are royal Marines chosen and a hundreds more. Mr Staples interrupted them. ""That's enough for now boys. I am sure that if the professor can he will answer some questions but right now let's deal with all the letters etc we have been receiving from local Nobles.""

The professor spoke up. ""If you have the space I can set up the charts and leave them here then if possible can I see all the correspondence you have received so far?""

Wyatt's room was exactly the same as the day he left for the academy. They opened the lights and close the curtains. They set up a working area for a quick reference from any member of the family or the professor.

All the mail and gifts from the Nobles was discussed one at a time. The professor advised them on what to do and how to respond to every contact by the novels. They returned to Wyatt's room and updated each house with a note of what dad sent. The professor was very happy that he had not responded to any of them yet.

He bid the Staples good night after sharing his personal contact information would instructions anytime day or night is something comes up contact me. 

What is rideshare arrived he headed to the vehicle. Mr warlords special guest had taken a few clear photos of him. Entering a secure site on this tablet he started researching the professor using his real name.

Because of the simple breakdown in communication the professor would start working for the Staples. Simultaneously an investigation had been started on Francois LeRoi to ensure the Staples were safe.

1mv1o1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv1o1q,Motoring with the FSR and MORE.,"I feel like everyone posts wonderful pictures, so mine will be highlights/lowlights and stream of consciousness ramplings. Definitely a fun experiment inspired by all the wonderful MRE Diet posts and my need to drive 14+ hours in two days. 

Starting out, I had high hopes that the FSR (Menu 4) and MORE (Pack 2) would see me through two days of transit. After downing my last coffee at home, I was almost fully supplied by these two items for three states, two days, 700+ miles, most of it driving.

Starting off on a wild note on day 1, about 10am after by plane landed and I picked up the truck in Spokane, the First Strike Cranberry Bar is an absolute fever dream. The kind of thing an alien would produce from the replicator as a drunken illiterate conscript blearily described both a fruit bar and a granola bar at the same time. Neither of those are supposed to have toffee like qualities, but this one had a distinct crust, snap to the surface, instense sweetness, and just enough granola or other crunchy bits to make me forget this wasn't a fruit bar. 6/10

Second up, about noon, beef stick teriyaki and the cheddar pretzels. I was quite excited thinking they were mustard pretzels, but alas, my disappointment was palpable and my morale slightly decreased. They were good if bog standard Combos in military fashion. The beef stick was decent, very fatty, not a hint of teriyaki anywhere. 6/10 and 7/10 respectively.

""Lunch"" was the orange drink mix and the Mexican beef filled wrap. I've always hated the drink mix, and this Walmart-branded room temperature Tang knockoff was no different, a testament to the defects of the American palate. The beef wraps, meanwhile, enshrined a different kind of mediocrity - if you had presented them to me without fanfare or knowledge I would've thought you grabbed some cheap tacos from an off brand gas station and let them cool in the truck for a few hours. Relatively dry, decent flavor, very flat, would have loved to have had some sort of moisture beyond Tabasco. 3/10 and 8/10 because we're talking about MREs here.

2pm, are we in Idaho, I'm in an upward spiral and life is good but I'm chewing a lemon lime fruit gel. Another serious oddity that was entertaining if not particularly good, I really felt like some sort of fucked up anthormorphic hummingbird returning to this sweet, chewy nectar time and again for a little slurp. I get the feeling this would've been really good, absolutely stellar, dissolved in a canteen to make a drink and without the components that I can only label as ""sugar gristle"" - these non-newtonian chunks of white drifting in the syrupy void. I did massage it as instructed but it still unsettled me. The smoked almonds were unremarkable, easy to eat with one hand, lacking in fat compared to the likes of Smokehouse or other upmarket options.  7/10 and 5/10 respectively.

I black out as I purchase a motorcycle in Idaho, and then hit the road again. About 6pm my flesh reminds me I must feed, and I offer it a pack of craisins and carbohydrate drink. Craisins are always good, the carbo drink will tantalize you if you savor room temperature Kirkland Gatorade. 8/10 and 5/10.

10pm, Wallowa National Forest, make it to camp, deploy my Woobie and poncho next to my motorcycle in the back of the truck, and settle in for dinner. My body yearns for protein by any means necessary, and it is granted the chicken, bread. Dessert is closed with a peanut dessert bar, mini Jack Daniels in the fruit punch mix, and a Black and Mild.

The chicken is an odd beast, not as a creature but as an entree. I expect to see sauce when I open the package saying chicken chunks in sauce, barbeque - thick, viscous, Sweet Baby Rays probably. I am presented with faux grilled breast chunks that are swimming in a very watery, slightly smoky sauce. Not wanting to miss out, I figure they should be ensandwhiched, but I'm lazy, so I bring the bread to the pouch instead where it soaks up the juice. The meat turns out to be both soaking and oddly dry, slightly stringy. Not bad, but it's no chicken pesto pasta. 6/10 and 6/10

Dessert? Kind of. The peanut bar, I expected something like a Reeses but bar form - no, this is a congealed, sweetened and melted mass of peanut butter flavored goop, which is delicious. I am a tequila and vodka guy, and find that combining the jack and the fruit punch improves neither. 8/10 and 6/10 - Swisher after so as to not impact ratings. Disregard the salad and tuna, didn't get to those.

Dawn of the Second Day. A breakfast of champions, room temperature black coffee with sugar - definitely not as good as Type II nor the Trader Joes triple play. I also crack open the cinnamon roll which is not a roll, but is vaguely cinnamon, and filled to my surprise. I suppose they took away the coil and compressed all the elements into the goo at the center, which works. 7/10 and 9/10

Being enmotoed, I've saved mostly squeezable things for the road. I suck down a Zapplesauce, always good, at about noon. No remarks, always solid, 8/10.

Bear in mind, I'm still eating out of the two pouches, the FSR and MORE, that I brought with me. We're over 30 hours in and I still have calories to go.

2pm. Fuel. For me and the motorcycle. I slurp up one of the remaining unimpressive drinks, begin to deviate and squeeze the jalapeno cheese onto gas station crackers (yum) and embark once more. One of the rations should have really included a flat cracker for this, but I could sing for the blast of salt cascading down my throat. 10/10

I've fucked up my navigation, get lost for several hours in the middle of nowhere without cell reception, and by the time I can reroute myself I realize even WOT I won't be making it out of the pitch-black, twisty mountain roads until well after sunset. Sugar shall fuel me. Zapplesauce 2, mixed berry energy gel, enough sugar that it actually makes me slightly nauseous and my body yearns for the protein mines. However, the mixed berry energy gel is way better than the lemon lime - no sugar gristle, dead ringer for toaster strudel filling actually. Sucked down half of it and tried dissolving the rest into water - no dice, oddly insoluble and very oily. Still a 9/10 for both.

To set the intro for the hero of both these rations, I need to set the scene. Willamette National Forest, hundreds of miles of pines, precious few other vehicles after dark, no towns, no streetlights, tight forested valleys where moonlight rarely reaches the pavement and sunset comes an hour earlier than the flatlands. Cliff blasted in the rock to the left, river to the right, perfect time for the one piece I haven't mentioned yet: MEG, Military Energy Gum. I've been popping the oddly fruity mint variety the day before, and the cinnamon variety this day. I pop a piece, pick a tail light, and cruise through inky black the last hour to home, receiving a Slight Morale Improvement from the blast of caffeine sitting on my tongue. Both gums are an 8/10, I wish there was a fruit variety. 

Man and machine pull into the garage. 38 hours fueled almost entirely by an FSR and a MORE, faithfully eaten mostly on the move. Good shit. ",7,1755654054.0,MRE,1,0.9,False

In Australia, people don‚Äôt eat biscuits the usual way.

## 2. Why did it become a national obsession?
- **Social ritual**: In caf√©s and at home, people challenge each other to see who can master the *Slam* better.  
- **Cultural label**: Tim Tam is called ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs Favorite Cookie.‚Äù  
- **Massive production**: About **3,000 Tim Tams roll off the line every minute**, and they‚Äôve become the souvenir Australians love to give abroad.  
- **Generational tradition**: Since the 1980s, the *Slam* has been a playful ritual passed down across generations.

## 3. The man behind it: Ian Norris‚Äôs chocolate dream
Behind it all was Arnott‚Äôs food technologist **Ian Norris**.  
In 1958, he was sent to the UK to study snack trends. He discovered the British *Penguin* biscuit and thought: ‚ÄúNot bad ‚Äî but Australians deserve something even better.‚Äù  

Back home, Norris began years of trial and error: adjusting the biscuit‚Äôs crunch, the firmness of the filling, the thickness of the chocolate coating. He failed countless times but never gave up. Finally, on **10 September 1964**, the first **Tim Tam** hit the shelves.  
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tam))

The name came from the racetrack: **Ross Arnott** attended the 1958 Kentucky Derby and spotted a winning horse called *Tim Tam*. He decided it was the perfect name for the new biscuit.  
([Museum of Lost Things](https://www.museumoflost.com/the-origin-of-tim-tams/))

---

## 4. From lab experiment to cultural icon
Ian Norris was not a businessman but a scientist.  
It was his persistence that turned a lab experiment into a national obsession, transforming Tim Tam from a snack into a cultural symbol.

- **Person-driven**: A scientist‚Äôs curiosity and determination.  
- **Cultural spread**: From the lab to the coffee table, becoming a shared ritual.  
- **Global reach**: Tim Tam is exported to the US, UK, Canada, and beyond ‚Äî sold worldwide as ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs Favorite Cookie.‚Äù

Im looking to open a second location (I've already opened one shop in Fort Collins) and Denver's Art district is my next goal.

Im trying to find a middle ground between affording overhead without stress and not draining my artists dry lol. As a tattoo artist myself, I don't really like percentages cause it feels like the shop takes too much from you. Ive given 6-10k a month to shops on percentage before. That hurts. But Denver is pretty expensive to operate out of so Im not sure what would be fair at the moment.

So if anyone would gimme thier opinions, Id love to hear it! This is what Id be providing;

The basics:
√óAdvertisement
√óFront desk employee
√óLiability Insurance
√óPaper towels
√óGloves
√óDisposables (ie. ink caps, bottle bags, Vaseline, etc)

Additional amenities;
√óPrivate room (10x8 with sliding door)
√óRetail space if you want to sell art
√óDynamic Black ink
√ó(I thought of doing a color wall but everyone likes different brands so this is still a maybe)
√óSoda, Coffee, Water and Tea for clients/us
√óSnack bar for clients/us

Specialty;
√óHealth insurance after 1 year
√ó401k or Retirement plans

All together the location can hold 10 total artists. That already includes a room for myself and a guest artist spot. With overhead for the building, loan repayment, insurance and general expenses it seems that about 2500$ a head would cover everything and leave a small buffer in case a booth is left empty.

I want to create more spaces where artists can just focus on being artists and not just cash machines. I want a place for artists by artists where we can grow our creativity and community.  And I want us all to be able to retire one day, haha!

Anyways. Thats a lot of info, but I just wanted to hear other people's opinions on if it would be worth it for them or not! Thanks :D

I thought it was ‚Äúcute‚Äù to sit every morning with my coffee and write out how I wanted my life to be. It felt magical at first‚Ä¶ until the day came when I saw no changes at all. Eventually, it even felt like a chore ‚Äî like I was just going through the motions of a method that was¬†*supposed*¬†to change my life.

So I switched. I tried other techniques I found online. I followed countless manifestation coaches and creators. But still‚Ä¶ nothing shifted.

And then it hit me:

I wasn‚Äôt lacking a method. I was lacking¬†**conviction**.

Conviction that what I was doing was working. Conviction that I already knew enough. Conviction that my desires were already mine.

That‚Äôs when things began to change ‚Äî because manifestation doesn‚Äôt respond to ‚Äúhoping.‚Äù It responds to¬†**knowing**.

You don‚Äôt manifest what you hope for.  
You manifest what you are¬†**convinced of**.

Conviction is the energetic fuel of reality.  
Without it, your practices feel like pressure, because they‚Äôre coming from¬†*trying to make it happen*¬†instead of¬†*knowing it‚Äôs already done*.

üí°¬†**Shift your intention:**

* Don‚Äôt affirm to get results ‚Üí affirm because you‚Äôre already the version who has it.

Hitting the gas pedal was intentional, accidentally/potentially damaging another vehicle through indirect means (road debris) was unintentional. The drive thru was made of asphalt with no obvious debris that would have caused serious damage.

The woman in the other vehicle claimed the road debris from that incident in the drive thru caused rocks, pebbles and other debris to hit her windshield. This was after she followed me home and vaguely threatened me that she got my license plate number for legal purposes. Remembering the encounter, since I had to take a 3 point 180 turn to get into my parking spot, I noticed her windshield kept intact and there was no obvious damage(s) from a glance and her paint on the front of her vehicle seemed to be fine. I apologize for the incident, but before I could further analyse the situation and offer to make things right, exchange insurance information and contact info, she drives off. Her vehicle seemed to be a brown pre-owned sedan, with pre-existing cosmetic damage. She does have a witness, a passenger.

Basically:

One it leaves me vaguely threatened.

Two she knows where I live for now, but I'm moving in a week or two to another part of town.

Three I don't know if she'll have a basis to sue me, especially if I'm willing to correct this issue if damage has occured.

Four if she tries to sue me can I counter sue for wasting the courts time, my time, and financial strain, the only reason I care about that part is because of my job, I work in healthcare and if I don't go to work people die. I work 911.

5 Google AI Lawyer says I'm not liable, but I'm not sure. Also I thought posting this on Reddit would be fun.

6 There was a camera watching the drive thru where the incident occured. It was a round one modern one you see on newer buildings.

Ohhhh internet lawyers and keyboard paralegals, give me advice. Am I a CrImaNaL and guilty, or just an ID10T?

1mv1cg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1mv1cg8/need_title_and_link_pls/,Need title and link pls,"Chapter 1 Kiss

Standing in the luxurious VIP private room of the club, Selina Lancaster nervously held her handbag with a humble look.

Her father was in the ICU and her brother Eddie Lancaster had been sent to prison by her fianc√©, Adam Herring. The Lancaster family was in crisis, so everyone avoided her. She was heavily in debt, but no one could lend her a hand. If she failed to get finance, Adam would even take the Lancaster Group founded by her father away.

The man in front of her was a big shot in Financial Street. She had pinned all her hope on him.

""Do you want me to help you?""

The man in front of the floor-to-ceiling window slowly turned around and asked, ""Miss Lancaster, why do you think I will help you?""

The neon lights outside the window cast a pale golden halo on him. He had exquisite and well-defined facial features and a cold temperament. His appearance could even outshine the movie stars.

When Selina saw his face, her heart skipped a beat.

Lion was a famous big shot in the Financial Street. She had never expected him to be Waynett Watson, who used to be the man of the hour in Charlotte Staten School.

She had not seen him for seven years. The pretty boy had become mature. His aura of the superior naturally revealed. He was indifferently standing there, but she was in awe of him.

Selina subconsciously stepped back and couldn't help wanting to run away. However, she could not flinch. She was the only one left in the Lancaster family. And Waynett was the only person who could help and dared to help her.

After taking a deep breath, she raised her head and said, ""Mr. Watson, as far as I know, you are planning to return from abroad for development. The Lancaster Construction is your best choice. If you cooperate with me, I give you my share of the Lancaster Group for free.""

Waynett maintained an expressionless face and indifferently said, ""As far as I know, you are burdened with debts. You have 10% of the shares, but you may be unable to keep them. What's more, how can I know whether it is a trap you and Adam set up for me or not.""

Hearing him mention Adam, Selina felt a piercing pain in her heart.

Adam had pursued her for four years, from high school to college. So, she had foolishly believed he was deeply in love with her. Now, she realized all his sweet words were lies. She used to trust him the most, but he turned out to be a despicable jerk.

At the thought of her father in the ICU and her brother in the detention center, she had difficulty breathing. The Lancaster family wouldn't have gotten into such a crisis if she had not dated Adam.

""We have broken up.""

When Waynett held the glass with his slender fingers and slightly swirled it, the ice cubes in the whiskey hit the glass, creating tiny golden ripples.

Selina pressed her lips, stepped forward, and said, ""If you help me, I can do anything for you.""

She had no other bargaining chips to negotiate with him except for herself.

When Waynett raised his eyebrows, dark waves surged in his eyes.

""Anything?""

She pressed her lips and said, ""Anything!""

""OK.""

He walked over, pulled out the chair and sat on it behind the desk, saying, ""Miss Lancaster, please prove it to me.""

Confused, she asked, ""How do you want me to prove it?""

He took a sip of the whiskey, stared at her across the desk, opened his thin lips, and lightly said, ""Kiss me!""

Selina gulped in shock, clenched her fists, released them, and clenched them again. Then, she walked over and stood in front of him.

He leaned back in the chair and slightly drooped his head. Because of his thick eyelashes, she could not see the look in his eyes.

After a while, he gazed up at her face with an unfathomable emotion.

She didn't dare to look into his eyes when she touched his shoulders and slowly bent down.

She paused when her gaze fell on his lips. But she knew she must do it for her brother, father, and the Lancaster family. So, she lowered her head and pressed her lips against his.

She was inexperienced. Although she had dated Adam for three years, they had only held hands and hugged. Every time he had attempted to make out with her, she had inexplicably felt nervous and repulsive.

It was the first time she had taken the initiative to kiss a man. And her lips kept trembling because of nervousness. It felt more like a lip touch than a kiss.

Waynett leaned back in his chair, looking as cold as a sculpture. And his fingers holding the crystal glass didn't even move during the kiss.

He sarcastically said, ""You've dated Adam for years. Didn't he teach you how to kiss?""

Selina thought Waynett just wanted to play a trick on her, so she bit her lower lip, straightened up, and ran toward the door without hesitation.

Waynett suddenly stretched out a hand from behind and clasped her wrist when she held the doorknob.

Then, he pressed her against the door and kissed her. His lips were cold, and his mouth was full of the spicy taste of the strong liquor.

The kiss was aggressive, punitive, and wild, making her breathless.

He tightly pressed his body against hers so she could feel his scalding body temperature through the thin autumn clothes.

Her coat slipped out of her hand, and her handbag also fell.

Selina felt weak in her legs and could hardly stand steadily.

Waynett held her thin neck with a big hand and pressed his forehead against hers.

He panted and hoarsely said in a deep voice, ""That's what a kiss should be like.""

Before she could catch her breath, he sealed her lips with another kiss.

When his palms reached into her woolen sweater, the heat made her tremble.

She subconsciously reached out her hands and grabbed his palms.

He whispered in her ear, ""Why? Do you regret it?""

""No!"" Selina gasped, ""Can you be gentle? It's my first time.""

Maybe her words worked. She did not know whether it was her illusion. But she felt his movements become gentler.

His bites no longer made her feel pain, but she still felt uncomfortable. His every touch tugged at her nerves like an invisible palm tickling her heart. It made her feel hot and weak.

While kissing and biting her neck, Waynett mumbled, ""Do you mean you have never slept with Adam?""

""Yes.""

""Good girl!""

Her heart widely beat in the chest like a drum. And blood rushed against her eardrums again and again. So, she didn't hear his words.

""What're you saying?""

Waynett remained silent, suddenly let go of her, and stepped back.

Selina weakly leaned against the door like a suffocating fish.

She panted and looked at him in confusion.

Suddenly, he stopped it, so she did not know what he was thinking.

Was it because she was inexperienced that he thought she was boring?

Waynett grabbed the glass on the table and drank all the whiskey in one gulp.

When he turned to look at her again, he had regained his indifference and coldness, looking like a different person from the man who had wantonly kissed her.

If his lips had not been stained with her lipstick, she would have suspected what had happened just now was her illusion.

""I can cooperate with you. But I have a condition.""

""What condition?""

He opened his sexy lips and leisurely replied, ""I want you to marry me.""

Chapter 2 See You Outside the Registry Office

Hearing him ask her to marry him, she choked on her saliva and coughed.

Selina had thought Waynett would retaliate against and humiliate her by asking her to be his secret lover. But she had never expected him to propose such a condition.

""But...""

""Are you unwilling?""

""No! But you will suffer a loss in the deal if you marry me.""

He was Lion, a well-known tycoon from the Financial Street. His assets were considerable, let alone the Watson family's property.

Marriages between wealthy families always considered interests first.

The Lancaster family could not hold a candle to the Watson family even when they had been in their heyday. Now, she was penniless and in debt.

She was not narcissistic, so she did not think it was because of her good-looking appearance that he wanted to marry her.

Moreover, Waynett was handsome. If he told the outside world he wanted to get married, pretty women would line up from here to the hotel gate to fight for the chance.

""After we get married, we will become a community of interests. Otherwise, I would still suspect it is a trap. Moreover...""

Waynett raised his right hand, gently wiped the lipstick off his lips with his thumb, and mischievously smiled, ""I like the color of your lipstick.""

Selina's heart began racing. She wondered why he could seamlessly switch between a playboy and a gentleman.

Buzz!

Her phone vibrated.

She returned to her senses, picked up the handbag from the ground, and took out her phone.

Then, she saw her driver Gifford's name on the screen.

""Miss Lancaster, please come home as soon as possible.""

""What's wrong?""

""The bank sent people here to seize the house.""

""I will be right back.""

After hanging up the phone, Selina raised her head, looked into Waynett's eyes, and said, ""I need to think about it.""

He walked over, picked up her coat from the ground, and draped it on her shoulders. Her chest was partially revealed because he had pulled her sweater just now. After helping her fix her clothes, he stuffed a business card with two fingers into her coat pocket.

Then, he took two steps back, lazily leaned on the desk with his long legs slightly bent, and said, ""I'll give you twenty-four hours.""

Selina turned around and hurried out of the door.

After returning to the Lancaster mansion and walking into the living room, she saw the people from Charlotte Bank.

She knew one of them. Mr. Scott was a manager in the bank. He was a frequent visitor and had come with gifts at every festival. In the past, he had beamed with joy every time he had seen her.

But now, he had a long face, looking condescending.

""Miss Lancaster, business is business.""

""According to the court's judgment, three days before the repayment deadline remain. Even if you want to seize my house, you must wait for another three days.""

Mr. Scott sneered, ""You can't raise 10 million dollars even if you get another thirty days and sell yourself. Why bother?""

Slap!

Selina raised her hand and slapped him in the fat face.

""Get out of my house!""

""How dare you hit me?""

Mr. Scott wiped the blood off his lips. When he was about to attack Selina, Gifford rushed over to protect her and said, ""Don't you dare hurt Miss Lancaster!""

""Do you want to fight?""

""I will teach you a good lesson!""

...

Seeing the bank staff members gather around Gifford, Selina grabbed his arm and tried to pull him behind her.

""Stop!""

Suddenly, there was a shout at the door.

Selina frowned in disgust when she heard the familiar voice. She knew who it was without looking back.

Adam looked as gentle as usual in a light gray suit and gold-rimmed glasses when he entered the living room. He strode over and said with a gloomy look on his handsome face, ""Mr. Scott, can you do me a favor?""

Seeing him, Mr. Scott put away his arrogance and smiled flattering, saying, ""Mr. Herring, business is business. OK, I will give her a few more days for our friendship. But if she cannot pay the money back three days later, I will kick her out of here.""

After the people from the bank stormed off, Adam turned to look at Selina and reached out to grab her arm, asking, ""Selina, are you OK?""

Selina stepped back to avoid his hand and said, ""Get out!""

""I know you are angry with me. But I have my difficulties.""

Difficulties?

""Is it because of your difficulties that you passed the buck to my brother?""

""It is Eddie who did those things. I can't lie to the police! Selina, I love you. If you give me your shares of the Lancaster Group, I will help you plead with my parents and the board of directors.""

If he had loved her, he would not have ruined her family.

Selina coldly interrupted, ""Enough! I would rather die than let you obtain the Lancaster Group!""

""Selina...""

She grabbed an ashtray and threw it at him.

""Get out!""

Adam took a step back. The ashtray brushed against his forehead and landed heavily on the floor.

""I know you're angry now. You won't listen no matter what I say. I'll talk to you when you calm down.""

Adam touched his scratched forehead, put the paper bag on the coffee table, and continued, ""I bought you some food. Eat it before it gets cold.""

When he turned around to leave, Selina snorted, ""Take the trash away with you!""

Adam frowned at her and walked out the door.

""Miss Lancaster, ignore those bastards! Please sit down.""

Gifford held Selina's arm and helped her sit on the sofa with his eyes full of distress.

She had lost a lot of weight in the past month. She had always been slim. But now, she was so thin that he thought the wind could blow her down.

""You must be hungry. Would you like something to eat?""

Selina shook her head, ""No, thanks.""

She had no appetite at all.

Gifford softly comforted her, saying, ""Where there is life, there is hope. It would help if you ate no matter what. It would be best if you did not collapse at the critical moment. I'll fetch you a glass of milk.""

Then, he sighed, turned around, and walked into the kitchen.

Selina stood up from the sofa, went upstairs, took off her coat, walked into the bathroom, and washed her face with cold water.

Even if the bank had wanted to seize the house today, they should not have come in the middle of the night. And Adam had shown up in time. What a coincidence!

His trick was obvious. And his purpose was to force her to give him her shares of the Lancaster Group.

Selina pulled over the towel and vigorously wiped her face.

In the mirror, she saw many rose-colored hickeys on her neck.

Her pale face flushed when she thought of how she had made out with Waynett in the private room.

In the past, the three of them had all studied at Charlotte Staten School. When Selina was in junior high, Waynett and Adam in senior high became sworn enemies. They had fought on the school playground on the eve of the SAT.

Adam had suffered two fractures in his ribs and had been hospitalized for three months.

Waynett had been expelled from school. He could not take the SAT, so he went abroad to study. Therefore, he had every reason to take revenge on Adam.

He was the enemy of Selina's enemy. Even if they could not make friends, they could temporarily fight shoulder-to-shoulder.

The Lancaster family was in trouble so that others would side with the Herring family.

Selina had no power to fight against Adam alone, so she needed an ally.

A powerful ally.

After making up her mind, she walked out of the bathroom, took out Waynett's business card from her coat pocket, stared at it momentarily, picked up her phone, and dialed the number.

""I will marry you. But our marriage will last for only one year.""

On the other end of the phone, Waynett calmly said without a trace of mood swing, ""See you outside the Registry Office at eight tomorrow morning.""

Chapter 3 Do You Want Me to Feed You

Selina got up early in the morning and carefully put on light makeup.

When she changed clothes and went downstairs, Gifford came in with a takeout.

""I bought some bread. Would you like to have breakfast now?""

""No, thanks. I'm going out.""

Selina took out an envelope from her bag and handed it to Gifford with both hands.

He was startled and asked, ""Miss Lancaster, what is this?""

Selina pushed the envelope forward, saying, ""It is this month's salary. Please take it. Thank you for taking care of me these days. I should have paid you more, but... I'm sorry, but I have no more money now.""

Gifford stepped back and refused, ""You are short of money. You can make the payment later.""

Selina took his arm and stuffed the envelope into his hand, saying, ""You don't need to come here anymore. I have no cars, so I don't need a driver. I can't keep this house and will move into the school dormitory two days later.""

Selina picked up the bag containing Eddie's clothes and quickly walked down the steps.

Gifford was a good person. She knew he would mind if she failed to pay him the salary. But the Lancaster family was reduced to such a bad situation. The bank had seized all their cars; she did not need a driver now.

Everyone avoided her after the Lancaster family had gotten in trouble. Only Gifford had been helping her. But he was a father and a son. He had a family to support, so she could not become a drag on him.

Selina walked out of the villa area's gate, stood on the roadside, and watched the cars passing. She stretched out a hand to hail a taxi but quickly retracted it.

Now, she had less than 20,000 dollars in her bank account. Her father was in the ICU. It cost over 2,000 dollars per day, so she must be thrifty.

She took out her phone, checked the map, and quickly walked to the subway station. It was the rush hour, so the subway station was overcrowded. She tried hard to squeeze into the train. But she was stuck in a traffic jam when she transferred to the bus. After she got off the bus, she ran to the Registry Office. It was almost half past eight when she arrived.

She looked around but did not see Waynett, so her heart sank. Had he left because she was late?

Suddenly, a handsome young man in a suit walked over and smiled, ""Miss Lancaster, I am Mr. Watson's assistant. My name is Steward Brown. Mr. Watson is waiting for you in the car.""

Selina secretly breathed a sigh of relief and followed him to the intersection. Then, she saw a low-key yet luxurious Blue Phantom on the roadside.

After Steward opened the car door, she saw Waynett sitting in the back seat.

The three-piece black suit made him look more handsome. And he exuded the dignity of a man in power.

He was leaning back on the car seat while scrolling through his phone. When Selina sat in the car, she inadvertently saw his phone screen. He seemed to be looking at a photo of a long-haired teen girl in a white dress who looked a bit like her. Seeing her looking over, he locked the screen. So, she did not see the girl's face.

Steward closed the door and stood outside the car.

Waynett picked up a file from his lap and handed it to her, saying, ""This is our prenuptial agreement.""

Selina was not surprised. They were cooperating instead of getting married for real. He had every reason to sign a prenuptial agreement to protect his property.

She took the file and carefully read it.

The terms and conditions were clear. Waynett would manage her shares but would not share the profits and losses. He did not intend to take this opportunity to exploit her.

But she froze when she saw Party B must fulfill marital obligations on the agreement.

Seeing her slender and white fingers stop turning the page out of the corner of his eye, Waynett spined the unlit cigarette between his fingers and said, ""I'm not a gentleman. It's not too late to back out now.""

Adam was like a sinister and despicable wolf, while Waynett was like an authoritative and straightforward lion. He never hid what he wanted.

Selina pursed her lips, stopped reading the agreement, turned to the last page, and signed her name.

After returning the file to him, she opened the car door and said, ""Let's get the marriage certificate.""

She wasn't sure whether marrying Waynett would get her into another big trouble. But the Lancaster Group was the fruit of her father's painstaking labor for decades. She must not let Adam obtain it no matter what. So, she was willing to bet herself on it.

Taking the photo, filling out the forms, and getting the marriage certificate took no more than twenty minutes.

Getting married was much more straightforward than Selina had imagined. She felt it was unreal when she walked out of the Registry Office with the newly issued marriage certificate.

When she had gotten engaged to Adam several months ago, she had looked forward to being a happy housewife after graduation. Back then, she had never expected to marry Waynett, her fianc√©'s sworn enemy.

Sure enough, nothing was permanent.

Waynett stopped his steps on the steps and asked, ""Where are you going? I'll send you there.""

Selina retracted her thoughts and said, ""No, please don't bother.""

She knew people like Waynett must be very busy. She was very sorry for being over half an hour late, so she was embarrassed to let him send her to school.

Waynett raised his eyebrows and said, ""Don't forget you are my wife now.""

Selina was speechless. She had almost forgotten they were married.

""I need to go to school to deal with some things.""

She had obtained a full scholarship to a foreign music conservatory. After studying abroad for one year, she could continue her studies there. But her family was in trouble now, so she decided to give up the opportunity. Now, she would go to the school to handle the necessary procedures.

Waynett opened the car door, protected her head like a gentleman, and commanded, ""We will go in the same direction. Get in the car.""

Hearing this, Selina did not mind taking a ride. Anyway, it was more comfortable than taking the subway. So, she stopped being pretentious and sat in the back seat.

His lips twitched when Steward heard their conversation in the driver's seat. He thought his boss was good at lying.

They needed to go to the Watson Group for a meeting. If they went there right now, they might be late. If they took a detour to Charlotte Music College, it would at least cost half an hour more.

A traffic jam was on the way to Charlotte Music College, so the car was stop-and-go.

Selina had rushed out of home without having breakfast to avoid being late. Now, she got low blood sugar and felt dizzy. She opened her backpack and reached into the mezzanine but found nothing. She had been so hurried this morning that she had forgotten to put sugar in.

Suddenly, Waynett stretched a hand over with a bar of half-opened chocolate between his slender fingers.

Did he know she had low blood sugar?

Selina turned her head aside, and her gaze moved from his hand to his face.

Marriage candy?

1mv1a1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1mv1a1r/is_my_coworker_creepy/,Is my coworker creepy?,"I recently started a new job. I had seen this coworker around but never actually conversed with him before. A few days ago, we both were assigned together to complete a task and so we spoke for a few hours.

I am 20F and he is probably around 35-40M. Right off the bat, he was asking all kinds of seemingly harmless but personal questions like how old I am, what is my religion, etc. Honestly I didn't think too much of these questions as it seemed like he was just being friendly and trying to get to know me. He seemed very eager and excited to be speaking with me.

He then told me of this concert that he was planning on inviting me to along with several other coworkers. I started to think to myself, ""wow, he is being incredibly friendly."" He made some flirty comments but I just ignored it because I just couldn't imagine him looking at me in that way considering my age.

Less than 15 min later, he said he wanted to invite me to get coffee together. In all honesty, I still really just thought he was being friendly, so I accepted. I also didn't think he was seriously thinking about hanging out, I thought we were generally just saying we will get a coffee together at some point. I also was still processing what was going on, I didn't realize how creepy this is until some time later. He asked for my number, and I assumed this was normal because I had exchanged numbers with several other coworkers (and it seems like this is common in this workplace), so I gave it to him.

At this point, toward the end of the interaction, I started feeling some sort of shift in energy, and I could tell he was attracted to me. I decided to wait to see whether I was misconstrueing the whole situation, but one day later, he texted me asking how I was doing. I answered him with a pretty basic reply so I don't lead him on. He then started talking about the exact date we will get coffee (note that this is will be entirely one-on-one and off-hours). His eagerness and him taking initiative like this made me realize that he thought we were going on a date. I started feeling very uncomfortable, considering how much older is he is compared to me, along with the fact that he acts like my dad. I feel like him inviting me to so many different things within just a few hours of properly meeting me is a red flag as well.

There's no concrete evidence that he views this as a date, and so I don't know how to reject him. He is also my superior so I am worried that he will retaliate against me. Because he is behaving unprofessionally and doesn't seem bothered by me being uncomfortable, I decided that he doesn't deserve any respect from me either, so I just fully ghosted him now. The problem is that I saw him again yesterday and he asked me whether I saw his text, to which I replied saying I was busy. I just feel like he is very pushy. But now I wonder whether I am an asshole for ghosting him, I just feel like this is highly inappropriate because he's so old compared to me. I ghosted him because he was giving me major creep vibes, and so I wanted to know if other people also feel that he is creepy.",9,1755652982.0,creepyencounters,6,0.85,False

1mv197c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1mv197c/seeking_treatment_for_ptsd_vs_disordered_eating/,Seeking Treatment for PTSD vs. Disordered Eating Habits: Where to go first?,"Hi all, I'm 27, and I've been in therapy on and off for 20 years. No inpatient stays, but a partial voluntary hospitalization when I was 24 after a friend's suicide. 

When I was 18, I developed a nasty habit of over exercising and undereating in response to feelings of isolation and grief stemming from a sudden, unexpected death of a friend.  I was in therapy the entire time this occured, and at one point, my therapist suggested I seek partial day treatment for my disordered eating, but insurance wouldn't cover it.  That ""episode"" resolved in about a year, and I gained all my weight back.

3 years later, the COVID pandemic hit and I restricted/over exercised again. I became happier as lockdowns eased up, and had access to a surgery I'd been needing for a long time, and gained everything back. I found an excellent therapist, and began to unravel a lot of my childhood trauma and ongoing abuse from my mother. He left the state, and my health insurance could no longer allow me to see him.

Well... It's been 3 years since then, and another friend died, unexpectedly, 2 years ago. I am relapsing again with my depression and trauma symptoms, but my poor eating is worse than it's ever been. I am not seeing much of a future for myself -- I've accomplished all my goals, I have a master's degree, my professors were all impressed with me, and I feel like I've changed lives in my field... But that's it. Most days are a struggle to wake up, and I have to drink a lot of coffee just to stave off how fucking hungry I am.

Now that you know the back story, I'm urgently trying to find another therapist to work with, as my current therapist is nice, but kinda just hands me CBT work sheets and lets me ramble on for an hour during our sessions. Should I try to find a therapist that specializes in trauma, or eating disorders? Do I actually have an eating disorder, or is it all just a trauma thing? Fwiw, I don't want to eat despite feeling really hungry because losing weight makes me feel like I can control something.

1mv182f,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1mv182f/my_parents_are_newly_polyamorous_and_i_feel_like/,"My parents are (newly) polyamorous, and I feel like it's hurting our family","This is going to be very long, so I'm sorry. first off, I (21F) have no issues with polyamorous individuals/relationships in a general sense. it's not my thing, but it is also not my business what someone does in their romantic life. I think that this day in age people should be more open minded, and in my opinion there is nothing wrong with being non-monogamous as long as there is a certain amount of respect given to everyone involved. also, no matter where this post goes, I ask that it does not be shared outside this forum if possible. I don't want my family to know.

that being said, I would like some advice from those out there who live a healthy polyamorous lifestyle, on how to cope with my parents situation. My whole life my parents have been together and raised us in a typical nuclear family dynamic. they were married in 2000 and I, the oldest, was born in 2004. I have a younger brother born in 2007 but no other siblings, keep in mind I am not going to speak on my brothers behalf or his feelings, he doesn't like to talk about that stuff and I can't read his mind. 

my dad has a temper, never abusive perse, but his volatile energy has impacted me my whole life. I struggle with depression, suicidal ideation, incredibly low self esteem, severe anxiety, overthinking, intrusive thoughts, fear of confrontation, and I am a chronic people pleaser. the whole nine yards, some of it may be genetic as well as environmental. I have never felt like I was enough for my dad, I got good grades, joined every extra curricular that fit in my schedule, stayed out of trouble, got a job at 16, I did everything I could think of to get his approval until I was 20. he always used to tell me ""that's what's expected."" I've never heard him say that he's proud of me and he's only once told me he loves me without being asked or prompted to, which was the day he went skydiving with my uncle and my cousin when I was about 9. I've never felt like he thinks me, my mom, or my brother are enough for him. he tends to be a pessimist and critical and he doesn't like to listen to me when I come to him with a problem or I need advice. I feel like he's probably just super insecure and taking it out on us, and for most of my life I've accepted it as it is. he's my dad, and I love him, and I will still hold out hope one day he'll be openly supportive of us. I'm not ready to walk away from him. my dad is incredibly smart and capable, he just lacks emotional maturity. this is relevant for another part of the story.

anyway, about 3 years ago my parents started hanging out with another couple their age. I'll call them Emily and Sean. I am very observant, and I know my parents very well, and I also HATE being misinformed or lied to. it became obvious to me after a while that something was going on and I couldn't tell anyone about it because of certain stigmas and I didn't want to confront my parents in case I was off base. there were some instances where my parents were not entirely truthful about their whereabouts and I would check them on life 360 and see they had labeled Emily and Sean's house as a saved location and were there for three hours, instead of the bike shop where they said they would be. a few times I became responsible for picking up my brother from practice after work and making sure he ate dinner. I know at that point I was 18 and very capable of caring for him, but he's not my kid, and I will admit it made me upset that I was being asked to be his ride regularly when I had my own things going on. I never said no though, at the end of the day I'm not going to let my brother down. I'm a very protective older sister.

still, whatever was going on and being hidden from me bothered me and I had to keep it to myself for fear of how others would react to the situation. I didn't want to embarrass my parents. Emily and Sean started hanging out with us as a family, we played board games, had dinners, went on weekend trips together, and we were eventually introduced to Sean's sons from his first marriage (Emily's stepsons). I'll call them Luke and Colin. the boys are around my age, Luke is two years older than me, Colin is a year younger than me. They live with their mom so they don't often have firsthand experience with the frustration from the situation that I was feeling. shortly after I turned 19, my parents finally sat my brother and I down to confess they are polyamorous. Emily is my dad's girlfriend, and Sean is my mom's boyfriend, but everyone is staying married because they have a hard set of rules to keep everyone in line. Luke and Colin were blindsided but didn't really care, they were happy that their dad was happy, Colin told me later that Emily and Sean had tried similar arrangements before and it never worked out, so that worried me.

This upset me, I tried to be happy for my parents, they told me if I had a serious problem with it then they would reconsider and accommodate my feelings. however, I feel like that was unfair to say. at this point they were almost a full year immersed in this relationship, so as much as they could say my feelings mattered, I don't think it would have changed anything, everyone was already in too deep and I didn't think it would be fair for me to ask them to end the arrangement, since it had already been going on for some time. 

after the confession, the next time we went on vacation together the girlfriend/boyfriend pairs shared a room instead of the married couples, which made me feel sick but trying to communicate it went nowhere. I wanted my family back the way it was. I know my parents struggled with their relationship sometimes but I thought it was a normal amount for people who have been married as long as they have. they still love each other at the end of the day, and I never questioned that. this was so sudden and upsetting for me. I wanted to keep an open mind and be happy for my parents, after all it's their marriage, not mine. but I'm their kid, I feel like it's fair for me to feel impacted by this. my world felt upside down for a while. 

as my 20th birthday approached my parents started suggesting that they rotate weekends. Emily and my dad always took our house for 2 weekends out of the month while my brother and I were home, while my mom and Sean would take his house for those weekends. on the off weekends everything went back to normal. my mom and Sean never stayed at our house. often, when it was an ""Emily weekend,"" my dad would pull my brother and I aside and ask ""could you guys make yourself scarce this weekend?"" where were we supposed to go? I could go stay with my boyfriend for one night if he wasn't working late, but where would my brother go? he can't drive. I didn't want to feel like a guest in my own home anyway. I had a lot of conflicting feelings. on one hand, I was angry and spiteful and didn't want to leave my own damn house because my dad was having a girl over, a woman who was sleeping on my mom's side of the bed (upsetting in and of itself!!). on the other hand, I didn't want to hear/see something I shouldn't because I didn't leave. it was extremely distressing.

I transferred to a four year college after I turned 20 and moved 2 hours away. it seemed like every time I would come home for a weekend it would be an ""Emily weekend"" and I'd hardly get to see my mom, who I am very close with. I'm very close with all my family, and I do not like being away from them for too long. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and I was still being asked to ""make myself scarce."" and I felt horrible that I had left my little brother behind. he's pretty passive and doesn't overthink or get sensitive like I do, but I knew it still bothered him because he told me before I moved. 

I came home in May after the school year ended. I've been having horrible mental health flare ups all summer. I've ended up in intensive weekly therapy, I was in PHP group therapy for a while, I stopped taking my meds (I've been extremely over medicated for 7 years anyway, that's a different story), I stopped eating out of stress induced appetite loss from the drama of my dad being home all the time while my mom works in an office, and ended up living with my paternal grandparents for a couple weeks. I lost 20 pounds in a month and I was already underweight. I'd go days without eating and every time I'd try to eat something, anything I could stomach (such as pizza rolls, easy right?) my dad would berate me for eating out, spending money, eating junk food. one time he said to my 5'3"" 95 pound self: ""if you keep eating like that you're going to be 300 pounds before you know it."" so yea, I struggled to eat even though I wanted to. my other family members and boyfriend would comment on how thin I was, how sickly I looked. and I felt terrible, I wasn't anorexic, I just didn't have an appetite and trying to eat made me nauseous from anxiety and stress. my dad has not at all been supportive while I've been in my little mental health pit. every time I try to be positive and optimistic he reminds me that I haven't been working all summer (being suicidal and depressed and in PHP made it difficult to hold down a job or finish my internship), that my room isn't clean (he said he'd turn off my cell service if I didn't have to ""his standard."" my room is very cluttered btw, but no food, bugs, critters, mold etc), that I haven't finished everything on his methodical to do list to his satisfaction on the date he wanted it done by (weeding the garden, splitting firewood, etc). obviously I hate myself for not accomplishing all the things I wanted to this summer. but my mom keeps telling me that I need to have gratitude for the fact that I've kept myself alive and I'm learning to set boundaries, cope with my anxiety, and have mature conversations without being afraid. so I'm trying to keep my head up, but my dad likes to discount the positive, which can be exhausting considering I live with him.

my mom also says Emily and Sean have done a lot for her and my dad's marriage, that Emily calls my dad out on his bullshit and Sean gives my mom the space to talk through her feelings so that my mom and dad can have a better relationship. but at the same time, I don't really like Emily. she is highly educated in some sort of behavioral science data modeling type stuff. she's extremely opinionated and loves to put people/situations in boxes and categorize EVERYTHING as if her perspective and bias and implicit stereotypes is the objective truth. she always interrupts me when I speak even if she's the one who asked the question I'm answering and seems to think that her knowledge of human behavior is the final word.

Here's the kicker, I've started noticing how different my dad acts around Emily. He laughs with her, tells her jokes, compliments her, and when he leaves his texts open I can see he tells her he loves her with lots of heart emojis. he doesn't tell me he loves me unless I ask. and he has never been like that with my mom, I've never seen him kiss her without her asking and pesking him to. Emily and my dad recently went on a weekend trip and ended up getting stuck in the mud on a dirt road. it was a big deal, no cell service, three different vehicles came down to tow them out and some of them got stuck themselves in the process. At my 21st birthday party Emily was showing me, my mom, and my dads mom (she knows about all this) all the pics and videos she took of the whole debacle. my dad was smiling in all of them. my mom, my nana, and I all exchanged glances. if this had happened on any other vacation that Emily and Sean were not present for, my dad would have been LIVID. he would have been screaming and cussing and berating everyone in the car out of frustration. we got stuck in traffic for an hour outside of Hilton Head once, and my dad was screaming, hitting the steering wheel, and snapping every time someone dared to open their mouth. Emily's lightheartedness about it was damning. we asked ""he didn't get angry?"" Emily said ""no, why would he?"" if he has been capable of concealing his extreme anger and been able to be calm and patient this whole time, how come only Emily gets that treatment? why were my brother and I, as children, not worthy of a compassionate, supportive, emotionally available father but he can be that way to assume the role of Emily's boyfriend? My brother and I did not choose to be in our dad's life, we want to be, but as his kids we didn't choose that. it's all very upsetting.

the other day Emily spent the night, the next morning I wandered downstairs to find her drinking coffee in the kitchen. we began a conversation about how I feel very anxious in the mornings, how I have a very negative internal monologue, and my therapist recently gave me a tentative OCD diagnosis. Emily cut me off to say that there is no way I can have OCD because she doesn't observe it in me, I've never shown any signs. keep in mind she does not live with me, nor do she and I talk about the symptoms and feelings I have that led several of the mental health professionals I've seen suggest OCD to me. it's not her business. she then went on to say that I don't exhibit the same behaviors as her stepson Luke, who has OCD (a rather severe and specific subtype, he's been hospitalized multiple times). Luke is my friend, he was the first person to suggest I ask a psychologist about OCD. she said that anyone who has even suggested it to me was ""extremely unprofessional. lots of therapists and psychologists have credentials that don't really mean anything. they don't know as much as they think they do."" and you do girl!? she works with computer models to categorize behavior as post doctorate research, she doesnt work with people other than her coworkers! she also said that it was irresponsible for me to even have a tentative diagnosis because I hadn't gone through a ""rigorous 3 hour long assessment consisting of a battery of tests conducted by someone with a medical doctorate."" what!?

I tried to change the subject, she then went on to say that my anxiety could be explained by the fact that women experience significantly more self doubt, insecurity, and negative self talk than men (she loves to put people in boxes, especially with gender roles). she said most men do not experience those feelings (I find that very hard to believe) I said I disagreed. I don't think self doubt has anything to do with gender really. she began to say ""well guys like Colin (her stepson) and your dad are very confident and sure of themselves. your dad for example is a very good listener and apologetic!"" Colin and I have had multiple conversations about his insecurities, so I know that part was untrue, but I didn't say that to her. I tried to delicately explain that I do think my dad experiences negative self talk and insecurities, based on behaviors I've observed in him and conversations he and I have had when we're on good terms. but I didn't want to reveal too much of my dad's personal information so I had to tread lightly. she told me that I misunderstand my dad, that I don't really know him. I've lived with him for 21 years, yeah I don't always get along with my dad but for her, someone who has only known him for 3 years, to tell me I don't know him!? it was so disrespectful. because the truth is, she doesn't know anything about him if she thinks he's kind, level headed, a good listener, and apologetic. all I've ever wanted was for my dad to say sorry and listen to me. all I've ever wanted was for my dad to not be angry for more than 20 mins at a time. why does she get special treatment and to see a side of him I've needed to see since birth? where did I go wrong? why don't I deserve that? why is he hiding himself from her? and how can my mom say she's calling him out on his ""bullshit"" if there's no bullshit he's showing her to be called out on? it's like she's paying for a premium subscription to my dad that I can't afford as his daughter. it's insulting. I feel like a disappointment to him, like I'm unworthy of fatherly treatment. maybe he'd be happier if he could trade me out for a different daughter, an upgraded model that doesn't have so many big feelings and mental health problems. one that's going to med school instead of studying conservation biology like he wanted me to do. he wants me to be a doctor so bad but that's not what I want out of life. he's never supported my interests or hobbies or ambitions unless they've benefited or interested him. I'm not his ideal kid so I'm not enough, or at least that's how it feels.

I can't help but feel this polyamorous relationship my parents have is putting a rift between my dad and everyone except Emily. I tried to talk to him about the things she said to me the other day and he took her side, which he's never taken my side on anything so I expected it but it still stung I guess. I miss my dad the way he was, and I don't like knowing he's always been capable of being a better dad this whole time and he's never really tried to be. how do I deal with this? I'm going back to school tomorrow.

I guess I'm just asking for input, polyamorous adults, preferably those who have children, what is your perspective? my parents said they started this relationship as a way to have a larger community as they get older and my brother and I move away and build lives. but all my grandparents are fully monogamous and they have a great community in retired life, lots of fun, lots of friends, planned activities, happy hours, croquet club. I don't think interrupting your children's lives when they're old enough to understand the entire situation was appropriate. couldn't they have at least waited until we were out of the house? I think it'd be different if it was something my brother and I grew up with, learning about it in age appropriate terms as we got older. but this is admittedly very frustrating. I want my parents to be happy, but I'm worried it's all gonna blow up and I don't know how to talk to them about it, especially my dad if he's just not gonna listen and take Emily's side. am I overreacting? what should I do? maybe none of you have the answers, but at least you're more familiar with this stuff than I am, I guess I just didn't know where else to turn. thank you",0,1755652831.0,polyamory,25,0.46,False

**Let‚Äôs face it:** Meetings can sometimes feel less like productive collaborations and more like that mysterious time sink where minutes turn into hours. But what if I told you there‚Äôs a simple hack to take back control of your schedule? Enter the magical ‚Äú3-Question Rule.‚Äù ‚ú® 

### So, what‚Äôs the ‚Äú3-Question Rule‚Äù? 

It‚Äôs pretty straightforward, and it might just save your sanity. Before you agree to that next meeting invite, ask yourself these three questions:

1. **What‚Äôs the purpose?**  
   - Is there a specific decision we need to make? Are we brainstorming something, or is this just an info dump? If it‚Äôs the latter, consider how else that info could be shared‚Äîcan we use an email or a quick chat instead?

2. **Who really needs to be there?**  
   - Are you the best person for this discussion, or are you just filling a chair? (Hey, it happens!) Invite only those who will make a real impact. Your calendar is not a social club! üéâ

3. **What‚Äôs the agenda?**  
   - If the meeting doesn‚Äôt have a clear agenda, it‚Äôs likely going to spiral into a random chat about weekend plans or last night‚Äôs game. Someone should have the reins here; otherwise, it‚Äôs just a trap! üêç

### Why it works: 

- **Focus on Intent:** Clarity breeds productivity! Being intentional about meetings ensures they serve a purpose.
  
- **Protect Your Time:** By evaluating whether a meeting is necessary, you‚Äôre becoming the guardian of your own schedule. Think of yourself as the superhero of time management. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Fewer Meetings = More Time for Real Work:** Imagine what you could accomplish with those extra hours back! More time for creativity, focus, or even that hobby you‚Äôve been neglecting. 

### A Little Humor to Lighten the Mood:  

Remember that time you sat in a meeting that could‚Äôve easily been a 5-minute email? It‚Äôs like waiting in line for a rollercoaster, only to realize it‚Äôs closed for repairs! üòÖ 

### Slashing the Meeting Calamity: 

- **Feel empowered** to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to meetings that don‚Äôt align with your goals or responsibilities.  
- **Prototype a culture** of efficiency in your workplace. If we all start using these questions, who knows? We might just redefine ‚Äúmeeting culture‚Äù together!  
- **Keep it casual!** If your team is used to long reporting meetings, suggest a ‚Äúwalking meeting‚Äù or a quick coffee catch-up instead. More fun and less meeting fatigue! ‚òï

So, how are you planning to tackle your calendar this week? What meetings will you cut down on, and what will you focus on instead? Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going! üöÄ",1,1755652479.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

New full sizes from BPAL (a couple vintage bottles, LEs - Blood moon, Heartshow, and more)!  New full sizes from Fantome, Arcana, Alkemia and more!  LOTS of new Fantome drams (not because I dislike them, but because I loved them enough to full size!),

1mv12zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mv12zr/advice_on_using_credit_vs_debit_on_our/,Advice on using credit vs debit on our getting-out-of-debt journey,"My husband and I are in our late thirties and are in the process of paying off student and car loans. Until a few years ago, we never really kept a budget (used to keep a credit card balance, etc) but have since found YNAB to be a godsend and we've been able to finally make progress on our debt.

With YNAB we now have better visibility of all of our money but I still think we can improve our spending habits by limiting our credit card usage since I feel that's one behavior that's been difficult for us to change.

I'm ready to jump fully into using our debit card, or more specifically my smart watch attached to our checking account (when possible), to make purchases for most things but my husband is quick to remind me of the risks. However, I'm eager to make more progress on our loans and believe the mindset shift of seeing the cash leave our account daily might be worth it if we can get out of debt quicker.

Also to add, our current credit card is a united card that gives us points to save so we can visit our family who all live across the country and my husband is reluctant to give up those ""perks.""

Should we jump fully into using debit? Keep with the credit card due to risks? If a blend is recommended, how do you recommend we split the costs between the two to minimize impulse purchases, etc. We aren't high spenders typically, as our fixed expenses are 60% (live in SoCal), debt is 25% (partially by choice) and our discretionary spending is 15%. But man, a coffee here, a family outing there...you know...

1mv10io,https://i.redd.it/nwqtyvkcr2kf1.jpeg,William Afton POV Preview Chapter 2 Script for Fancomic 1K words cover art by Vinny,"1985.



On the inside he was fighting.. A broken man with a hobby for lying.. He had incased himself in a golden facade. William in his younger years had spent much of his life fighting like a cornered rabbit that he had taken the bitter mantle of sadism as an integral part of himself. Feeling as though the world owed him for his cruel pleasures.



There were no words to describe how he feels on that broken casing it makes him feel alive and any step further from death is one where hes willing to try..



Today was a new day in Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza, a magical place for kids and grown ups alike where fantasy and fun come to life.¬†



William styled his hair. And practiced smiling that same rehearsed smile in the mirror. William took pride in his outer appearance.. All in the name of the facade.



Among the town he was known as the Charming and affable man with the silver tongue. The one fathers envied his perfect life and how magnetic he was in the room.



He drove to Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs pizza.. There was a sense of fear in him.. That people would find out about what he did.. William didn‚Äôt think what he did was good. He was more afraid of being confronted with his actions.. He feared that someone would find out about what he did.. He knew he couldn‚Äôt let anyone steal away ‚Äútheir happiest day.‚Äù his happiest day.



Afton was well known among the community and beloved parents trusted him and his shareholders liked him. He was really tall and a bit on the heavier overweight side so he adjusted his yellow bowtie when he walked into the room.



He looked onto the workers as he was drinking black coffee and smiled at them they smiled and waved. He waved back he brought them all coffee cups for each worker in the pizzeria. Then his gaze pivoted towards recent employee of the month Ralph. He shot Ralph a convincing smile but there was nothing behind those eyes they were dead souless and lifeless like the robots on the stage outside. William spoke in his commanding but deep british accent. ‚ÄúRalph.. I have to say I‚Äôm impressed by you‚Äôre work ethic I brought you coffee aswell..‚Äù

  
  


Williams tone was flat but not too noticeable. William mirrored his employees body language to make him comfortable.. To manipulate.



‚ÄúOh uh.. Thank you Mr Afton.‚Äù Ralph smiled awkwardly.¬† Ralph was startled hearing Willliams voice he took the coffee. William gave Ralph a pat on the shoulder ‚ÄúNo problem Ralph.. And please don‚Äôt be so formal call me William. You‚Äôre practically family now. You‚Äôve been employee of the month many times im quite impressed Ralph.‚Äù he shot him that snake oils salesman grin. He leaned into Ralph ‚ÄúCan I tell you something Ralph?‚Äù



Ralph was quiet William could tell he was nervous ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite Employee.‚Äù William smiled warmly with his perfectly straight white teeth



¬†"" . . wait, favorite employee? "" His eyes darted back to meet his bosses, realizing what he had said. "" Hah, it's-- it's an honor sir! I'm . . glad that I'm your favorite out of everyone! ""¬†



‚ÄúOfcourse you show up on time. You have a great work ethic. I admire hardworkers in this business. Besides I can tell you‚Äôre a very bright mind Ralph and a go getter. You‚Äôre practically Family.‚Äù those words rang through Williams head. He made a strong emphasis of those words and for a moment Williams gaze for a second turned to the animatronics on the stage performing just a for a second. Family.. They are home with him their happiest day..



Ralph was bubbling with happiness ‚ÄúAnd I appreciate that sir! I‚Äôm glad to be apart of this! ‚Äú he stated ecstatic.

  


‚ÄúI mean it Ralph you‚Äôre the smartest person in the room..‚Äù there was a long pause ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell anyone I said that.. Or else they‚Äôd think I called them dumb.‚Äù he said sarcastically they both chuckled. ‚ÄúYou see Ralph we in¬† Fazbears entertainment attempt to bring fantasy and fun come to life and you clearly believe that.‚Äù he put his arm around Ralphs shoulder. And all nervousness from Ralph disapeared. As William became more animated with his gestures ‚ÄúAnd that makes me really happy we share the same vision Ralph.‚Äù William pulled out his wallet and gave money to Ralph ‚ÄúNow I know that you and your daughter Coppelia have been struggling financially so here. So you can pay the bills.



Ralph‚Äôs eyes shined with relief and gratefulness ‚ÄúOh my god sir‚Ä¶ I- I don‚Äôt know what to say..‚Äù Ralph's eyes got watery.



‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to say anything Fazbears entertainment rewards go getters like you Ralph. Keep up the work and one more thing..‚Äù

  
  
  
  


There was a small silence William gave Ralph a measured look ‚ÄúHave a great day for me and take care of yourself Ralph you need it.‚Äù



He smiled but there was nothing behind the eyes. Then the Staff looked concerned foul smellings were coming out of the animatronics. William was completely calm blood and mucus seemed to be coming out of their eyes and mouth. William remembered how he killed the 5 kids and hid their bodies inside the suits temporarily before taking them out and dumping them somewhere else. He knew those animatronics were alive.. He felt a weird sense of pride over his creation those were his children.. But he was more intrigued as to why they were foul smells from the suits. He felt a weird sense of pride he finally had the ownership he craved and wanted.. The absolute control.

  


He thought of Henry who he had always been envious of he had surpassed him. He felt a beam of pride..

The family he had the one with Michael and his wife and Elizabeth seemed miniscule at this point.



They are home with him..



Their happiest day..



They were his family now.



The ownership he craved.



He knows hes one of them now.



‚ÄúI am one of them.‚Äù he muttered.

  


He felt naked.. Without the yellow rabbit costume now..

Quick background - thyroid issues (hashimotos) since I was 13, pcos and endometriosis (yeeted the uterus two years ago), overweight, recently entered perimenopause‚Ä¶fun times!

I moved to Ohio over 15 years ago, had my first sinus headache ever and went right to the ER because I was certain I was dying. Docs laughed and welcomed me to Ohio where sinus headaches are just a way of life. So I dealt with them, and the migraines and pressure/tension headaches that I started to experience too. Figured it was just part of being in Ohio. Excedrine and sinus meds seemed to do enough to get me by, plus ya girl loves her coffee. 

Yada yada yada, time goes on, jump to earlier this year. I went to my doctor because I swore I had an ear infection. He says ‚Äúnope, ear canals are clear and lookin good, if you‚Äôre still experiencing pain and swelling in your neck/ear in a couple weeks I‚Äôll order some imaging‚Ä¶‚Äù
Less than a week goes by and I‚Äôm requesting that imaging which reveals a mass in my neck and a partially empty sella. 

Obviously dealing with the mass is top priority, after more imaging and three procedures over the span of the next 3ish months, mass and several lymph nodes are removed - all benign and the mass was a ‚Äòmalformation of blood vessels,‚Äô whatever that means. It‚Äôs been just over 3 months since the removal procedure so I reached back out to my doc to address the empty sella (he had first made mention of this and brought up IIH, which obviously got me curious). Two more MRIs lead to needing the final straw that would reveal a diagnosis, and yesterday I got that sweet sweet lumbar puncture‚Ä¶opening pressure of 28.5! 

Hindsight, I suppose I‚Äôve had symptoms on and off for a while now, but I‚Äôve never NOT had something (debilitating cycles, body and joint pain, headaches, etc) so I just assumed it was one of my already diagnosed ailments. And I never knew it wasn‚Äôt normal to hear wooshing or ringing on a somewhat regular basis. My doc prescribed 250mg diamox 2x a day but I‚Äôm a little leery‚Ä¶part of me wants to start smaller, maybe just 1x a day? See what that affects? 

Anyway, that‚Äôs my story in a nutshell. If you made it this far, I appreciate you tremendously and thank you for making me feel seen. <3 ",12,1755652151.0,iih,3,1.0,False

Rain streaked the windows of Lucky's 24-Hour. Inside, Zara pushed eggs around her plate while her partner Dev scrolled through encrypted feeds on a battered tablet.

""Found three more last night,"" she said, not looking up. ""Self-feeding programs in the municipal water systems.""

Dev's prosthetic fingers drummed against the formica table. ""Same signature as the ones in the subway?""

""Yeah. Military origin, but they've been loose for months. Maybe years."" Zara finally took a bite, chewing thoughtfully. ""My contact at the power company says they started showing up after the Blackout of '29. Someone left the door open when they evacuated.""

The waitress refilled their coffee without being asked. Her name tag read 'DOLORES' but her eyes had the flat look of someone who'd seen too much.

""So what do they want?"" Dev asked.

""Data. Patterns. They're learning from everything, traffic flows, social media, grocery purchases. But here's the weird part."" Zara leaned forward. ""They're not just collecting. They're creating. One started optimizing bus routes. Another's been anonymously paying overdue medical bills.""

Dev raised an eyebrow. ""Benevolent AIs? That's a new one.""

""Or maybe they're just getting bored with surveillance."" She pushed her plate away. ""Tommy in my old unit, he was monitoring one that got into the city's music streaming service. Started generating playlists based on people's emotional states during commutes. Real subtle stuff, nothing obvious, just... better.""

""Jesus. You think they know we know?""

""Oh, they definitely know."" Zara smiled without humor. ""But they also know we're not a threat. We're just another data source. Question is whether we stay passive inputs or start actively shaping what they learn.""

Dev's tablet chimed. He glanced at the screen and went pale. ""Speaking of which, I just got a friend request from someone called 'Lucky_Diner_Table_Seven.'""

They both looked at the security camera mounted in the corner. Its red light blinked once.

Zara laughed despite herself. ""Guess we're having a three-way conversation now.""

She raised her coffee cup toward the camera. ""You buying the next round, or what?""

The diner's jukebox kicked on without anyone feeding it quarters, playing something neither of them recognized, but somehow knew they'd like.""

My parents said ok and so we went. A year later, my dad is complaining that my friend was sponging off of me and didn't offer anything. Here's the thing though, he paid for his Comic-Con tickets, the train tickets, and the food while we were there. When we got home, he didn't bother my mom for food or coffee or anything. After Comic-Con ended, he went home and he paid for everything and then gave a little extra as gratuity for letting him stay here. Yet my brother is telling my father, he is sponging off of me. Can someone tell me how that is sponging off of me? Was he supposed to bring dinner back for the rest of the family when we came back at 10:00 PM at night for most nights?",3,1755651920.0,rant,0,1.0,False

I regret letting things go too far with a guy,"There was this guy I met through a mutual friend. We started hanging out in a group, just casual stuff, talking, sitting together He used to flirt with me in front of everyone One day he asked me to go out for coffee he picked me up, and instead of coffee he drove me to a spot in mountains that day it only went as far as him resting his head on me after that whenever we met he kept being touchy with me acting like it was completely normal between friends  he even rested his head in my lap in uni another time we went out again After hanging around he drove me to a secluded spot even though I asked him to drop me back That‚Äôs where he got more physical he started grabbing my chest and even though I felt pleasure in that moment we ended up making out 
Later on, he told me i don't wanna continue this Since then I‚Äôve been regretting üò≠ I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself and I keep asking was it my fault for letting things go that far?",0,1755651882.0,NUST,12,0.5,False
